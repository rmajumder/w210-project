There are now 125,000 cases and 3,700 deaths.</p> \n  <p>Some observers have raised the possibility that the slow spread of the disease in Africa is due to the relative youth of populations. Moeti said data suggested that, as elsewhere, age and pre-existing conditions appeared important in determining the severity of each case, but countries everywhere on the continent faced significant difficulties accessing test materials and personal protective equipment for health workers.<br></p> \n  <p>A traditional remedy endorsed and distributed by the government of Madagascar will be tested thoroughly, she said. The WHO has previously <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2243669-no-evidence-madagascar-cure-for-covid-19-works-says-who/\">said there is no scientific evidence</a> that the herbal treatment is in any way effective.</p> \n  <p>Governments in Africa moved quickly to impose lockdowns and restrictions which helped slow the spread of the virus, but caused very significant problems to hundreds of millions of people living in poverty.<br></p> \n  <p>These are now being progressively removed, with South Africa, which imposed one of the strictest lockdowns, moving to level three on a scale of five this Monday. There has been controversy in the country - sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s most-developed - over a decision to allow religious services to go ahead if worshippers are restricted to less than 50 and strict social distancing precautions are observed. A ban on alcohol sale and transport will also be lifted.</p> \n  <p>Zweli Mkhize, South Africa\u2019s health minister, told reporters that no lockdown could last for ever and that it was time to provide some social and economic relief. It was hoped that religious leaders could educate congregations about the virus and how to keep safe, Mkhize said, adding that it had become clear that the country would be dealing with the pandemic for one to two years so \u201cthere has to be a degree of easing\u201d.</p> \n  <p>The emerging hotspot for the disease in South Africa - and in Africa overall - has been the Western Cape province, which includes Cape Town, the international tourist destination.<br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecfe9978f084e882655a8d0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T16:42:18.110Z\">5.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>GSK, the British pharmaceutical company, said on Thursday that its previous flu pandemic <strong>vaccine</strong> was not linked to a rise in cases of the sleep disorder narcolepsy.</p> \n  <p>The claim comes as the company said it planned to produce large volumes of an ingredient used in that vaccine for possible use in Covid-19 vaccines currently being developed.</p> \n  <p>According to <strong>Reuters</strong>, a spokesman for GSK said the \u201cscience has moved on\u201d since concerns were raised about links between narcolepsy and its H1N1 vaccine, called Pandemrix, which was developed during the flu pandemic 10 years ago. He said evidence now suggests the link is to the H1N1 flu virus itself, not the vaccine.</p> \n  <p>Previous studies in several countries, including Britain, Finland, Sweden and Ireland, had suggested Pandemrix was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/feb/09/ministers-lose-fight-to-stop-payouts-in-swine-flu-jab-narcolepsy-cases\">linked to a significant rise in cases of narcolepsy in children</a>.</p> \n  <p>Pandemrix\u2019s ingredients included a booster, or adjuvant, known as AS03, that could potentially be an ingredient in at least seven experimental COVID-19 vaccines, including one being developed by Sanofi, with whom GSK signed a collaboration deal in April.</p> \n  <p>Wendy Barclay, a professor and chair in flu virology at Imperial College London, said that since the link between narcolepsy and the 2009/10 flu pandemic is thought to have been due to cross-reactivity between parts of the H1N1 virus and human proteins that control sleep patterns, the Pandemrix vaccine\u2019s adjuvant may have played a role.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIf the virus/host cross-reactivity is the mechanism or explanation, then using an adjuvant in the vaccine to boost the immune response may have increased the chances that this cross-reactivity was generated,\u201d she told Reuters. \u201cWe still don\u2019t really know if this was the case or not.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecfd9108f087e3ca0f652e6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T16:27:14.177Z\">5.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Israel</strong> has launched a campaign to test 100,000 people for coronavirus antibodies, in preparation for a potential \u201csecond wave\u201d of cases, a top official said on Thursday, according to <strong>AFP</strong>.</p> \n  <p>The initiative is one of the world\u2019s largest such schemes and aims to test Israel\u2019s \u201ccollective immunity\u201d against the COVID-19 disease by determining how widely the virus has spread and who is most at risk going forward.</p> \n  <p>In parallel to the national campaign, authorities are also running separate surveys of \u201chigh-risk areas\u201d.

Even hairdressers have reopened (what did we learn during lockdown? How many Danes are natural blondes).</p> \n   <p>There are no face masks in sight, few gloved hands, and little sign of any seismic global interruption. The only visible difference between the throng pre-lockdown and now is that pedestrians walk in \u201clanes\u201d, depending on their direction of traffic, and mobile hand sanitiser stations are parked at intervals along the high streets. Sanitiser pumps grace every shop doorway and smaller retailers display signs instructing customers how many are allowed in at any given time.

The US has recorded more deaths from the disease than any other country in the pandemic, and almost three times as many as the second-ranking country, Britain, which has recorded more than 37,000 Covid-19 deaths. The latest count of fatalities is 100,442. Earlier this month, president Donald Trump said 100,000 deaths would be \u201chorrible\u201d, but he claimed that actions by his administration had prevented a much higher toll.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Military virus aid could look different if 2nd wave hits, says US defence secretary.</strong> US Defence Secretary Mark Esper said that as the US military prepares for another potential wave of the coronavirus, it may do things a bit differently, providing more targeted aid for cities and states and possibly shorter quarantine times for troops, AP reports.</li> \n   <li><strong>South Korea faces return to coronavirus restrictions after spike in new cases. </strong>South Korea has reported its biggest daily increase in coronavirus cases in 53 days, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/south-korea-faces-return-to-coronavirus-restrictions-after-spike-in-new-cases\">triggering warnings it may have to revert to stricter social distancing measures</a> after appearing to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/south-korea-first-steps-post-covid-world\">brought the outbreak under control</a>.The Korean Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported 79 new infections on Thursday with 67 of them from the Seoul metropolitan area, home to about half of the country\u2019s population of 51 million.</li> \n   <li><strong>UN: Virus could push 14 million into hunger in Latin America. </strong>The UN World Food Program is warning that upward of at least 14 million people could go hungry in Latin America as the coronavirus pandemic rages on, shuttering people in their homes, drying up work and crippling the economy, AP reports. </li> \n   <li><strong> </strong><strong>Coronavirus knocks a third of European Foreign Direct Investment \u2013 survey. </strong>Over a third of European foreign direct investment projects announced in 2019 have been either delayed or cancelled outright because of the coronavirus pandemic, an annual survey by professional services group EY found.

The US has recorded more deaths from the disease than any other country in the pandemic, and almost three times as many as the second-ranking country, Britain, which has recorded more than 37,000 Covid-19 deaths. The latest count of fatalities is 100,047.

(We are concerned here with breaches of the regulations, not the general Government guidance to \u201cstay at home\u201d.)</p> \n   <p>On April 12 2020, Mr Cummings drove approximately 26 miles from his father\u2019s property to Barnard Castle with his wife and son. He stated on May 25 2020 that the purpose of this drive was to test his resilience to drive to London the following day, including whether his eyesight was sufficiently recovered, his period of self-isolation having ended.</p> \n   <p>Durham Constabulary have examined the circumstances surrounding the journey to Barnard Castle (including ANPR, witness evidence and a review of Mr Cummings\u2019 press conference on May 25 2020) and have concluded that there might have been a minor breach of the regulations that would have warranted police intervention. Durham Constabulary view this as minor because there was no apparent breach of social distancing.</p> \n   <p>Had a Durham Constabulary police officer stopped Mr Cummings driving to or from Barnard Castle, the officer would have spoken to him, and, having established the facts, likely advised Mr Cummings to return to the address in Durham, providing advice on the dangers of travelling during the pandemic crisis.</p> \n   <p>Had this advice been accepted by Mr Cummings, no enforcement action would have been taken.</p> \n   <p>In line with Durham Constabulary\u2019s general approach throughout the pandemic, there is no intention to take retrospective action in respect of the Barnard Castle incident since this would amount to treating Mr Cummings differently from other members of the public. Durham Constabulary has not taken retrospective action against any other person.</p> \n   <p>By way of further context, Durham Constabulary has followed Government guidance on management of alleged breaches of the regulations with the emphasis on the NPCC and College of Policing 4Es: Engage, Explain and Encourage before Enforcement.</p> \n   <p>Finally, commentary in the media has suggested that Mr Cummings was in Durham on April 19 2020. Mr Cummings denies this and Durham Constabulary have seen insufficient evidence to support this allegation.</p> \n   <p>Therefore Durham Constabulary will take no further action in this matter and has informed Mr Cummings of this decision.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T12:29:31.340Z\">at 1.29pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecfac088f084e882655a5b1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T12:18:26.804Z\">1.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Boris Johnson still backs Cummings despite 'minor breach' of lockdown rules</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A No 10 spokesman said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> The police have made clear they are taking no action against Mr Cummings over his self-isolation and that going to Durham did not breach the regulations.

<strong tabindex=\"-1\">National Association of Head Teachers</strong> (NAHT), said fewer teachers would be available to support children with remote learning if pupils in reception, year 1 and year 6 are taught in smaller groups from next week.</p> \n  <p>His comments came ahead of the government\u2019s final decision on whether to reopen primary schools in England to more pupils from as early as Monday.</p> \n  <p>On Wednesday, the school standards minister, <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Nick Gibb</strong>, said it was \u201cdifficult to say\u201d whether the government\u2019s aim to get all primary school pupils back in class before the summer break will occur.</p> \n  <p>He told MPs on the education select committee: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Remote education, home education, will continue for the majority of pupils and young people \u2013 probably until the end of the summer term.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Findings from the NAHT suggest nearly three in five (57%) schools are providing home-learning resources for pupils daily and more than a quarter (29%) provide them weekly.</p> \n  <p>The survey of 4,784 school leaders, carried out earlier this month, also found that the majority of schools have been creating their own online resources as well as liaising with parents about home learning.</p> \n  <p>But the NAHT is concerned that the quality of remote learning on offer for the year groups that will not be returning to school in the summer term may suffer amid a wider reopening of schools in England.</p> \n  <p>Whiteman told the PA news agency: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Splitting classes in order to reduce the risk of transmission requires twice the number of staff, leaving fewer teachers to support those other children still at home.</p> \n   <p>I worry that an unintended consequence will be a detrimental impact on home learning.

The proposal has been squared with the home secretary, Priti Patel, and the prime minister\u2019s office, but details still need fleshing out.</p> <p>Raab stressed the offer was dependent on the precise next steps China seeks to take to impose its security laws.</p> <p>\u201cIn relation to BNO passport holders, currently they only have the right to come to the UK for six months,\u201d he said. \u201cIf China continues down this path and implements this national security legislation, we will change that status.

They don\u2019t like democracy, they hate all those things.&nbsp;They regard them as a threat to communism.\u201d</p> <p>He said he was not in favour of sanctions against Hong Kong but said Britain should make sure the issue of Hong Kong is on the agency of next month\u2019s meeting of the G7 and should support efforts to raise the issue at the UN security council when meetings resume.</p> <p>\u201cI hope Britain would start to work with our allies of liberal democracies around the world to make sure we have a united front supporting not only Hong Kong but actually standing up to bullying communists in Beijing,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cEvery liberal democracy in the world and other countries is going to look at their relationship with China and understand that Xi\u2019s regime \u2013 if you allow them to bully you on economic political or other issues \u2013 then they\u2019ll keep on bullying you. And I think we need to wake up to the fact that this is a new Chinese regime and it\u2019s a different sort of aggressive communism and it needs to be defended against.\u201d</p>",

Then, at the beginning of 2018, came the establishment of the new \u201ccop on the block\u201d, the Natural Resources Access Regulator (NRAR), which renewed focus on the practice.</p> \n<p>The NRAR was established to enforce NSW water law following the <a href=\"https://www.industry.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/131905/Matthews-final-report-NSW-water-management-and-compliance.pdf\">damning 2017 Matthews report</a> into government compliance failures, which the NSW ombudsman characterised as a deceptive \u201cshell game\u201d.</p> \n<p>According to the minutes of the January meeting of the NSW regional water senior officers group, the issue came to a head in November last year during meetings with stakeholders across river valleys dominated by cotton production \u2013 the Barwon Darling, Border Rivers, Gwydir, Macquarie and Namoi.</p> \n<p>An accompanying NRAR representative had been \u201cvery clear\u201d the regulator would be enforcing the law, provoking \u201charvesters\u201d to express their \u201cvery high awareness of compliance risk\u201d during the next \u201cfloodplain harvesting\u201d event.</p> \n<p>A flood was only weeks away, according to Bureau of Meteorology forecasts. The bureaucrats discussed a solution. The water minister, the National party\u2019s Melinda Pavey, had requested a draft regulation to amend the Water Act by exempting irrigators without a \u201cwater access licence\u201d.</p> \n<p>That regulation was issued on 7 February. The next day, under intense pressure from cotton irrigators, the department <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/12/nsw-green-light-to-irrigators-to-harvest-rainfall-angers-downstream-residents\">lifted a short-lived embargo</a> that had allowed floodwaters to flow into the upper tributaries of the desperately dry Darling River.</p> \n<p>With northern irrigators now exempt from the Act and with the embargo lifted, several hundred gigalitres of water may have been harvested by the end of March, according to independent northern&nbsp;Murray Darling&nbsp;Basin specialist Bill Johnson.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>For 20 years the NSW government allowed their northern basin mates to build whatever they wanted to catch water off the floodplains, but it was never legal</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>MP Helen Dalton</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cWater just disappeared, we don\u2019t know where it is, but it is really important we find out where water goes in these events,\u201d Johnson said. If his estimate is correct, the volume may have been larger than the annual 320 gigalitres the basin plan requires to be returned annually to the river system.</p> \n<p>The Shooters, Fishers and Farmers MP Helen Dalton said the minutes of the meeting show the so-called \u201cshell game\u201d was still in play.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor 20 years the NSW government allowed their northern basin mates to build whatever they wanted to catch water off the floodplains, but it was never legal,\u201d Dalton said. </p> \n<p>\u201cThey rushed to issue a regulation to get around the law, depriving the entire river system below. It\u2019s wiped out communities, horticulturalists, graziers, dairies, rice and grain growers.\u201d</p> \n<p>The significance of NSW hurrying regulation to exempt irrigators from prosecution is profound.</p> \n<p>The exemption allows for unapproved works \u2013 potentially including hundreds of dams, banks and levees \u2013 to be considered \u201celigible works\u201d, with no need for approval. </p> \n<p>It has sparked fury from downstream communities, who have called for a royal commission. </p> \n<p>Chris Brooks, chair of Southern Riverina Irrigators, a litigant in a class action against the Murray Darling Basin Authority for its alleged water mismanagement, said the failure to enforce apparent breaches of the law continued to \u201cthrow the southern basin under the bus for a few big, politically connected cotton farmers to make insane profits\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>Even leaders who thrive by bullying people have realised that they can\u2019t bully a pandemic. But nor does caution <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/17/putin-johnson-bolsonaro-and-trump-men-too-macho-for-masks\" title=\"\">fit</a> easily with their macho political image. Their temptation has been to let it run its course instead. Now the facts are catching up with them.</p> <p>The Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, has repeatedly dismissed the risks from coronavirus, defied his own government\u2019s advice by meeting crowds of supporters, and pushed states to reopen beauty parlours as the death toll climbed. This week it passed 25,000, and a study suggested it could hit 125,000 by early August. Brazil ranks second in the world for recorded cases \u2013 all the more shocking given its strong performance in the previous HIV and Zika virus health crises.</p> <p>Mr Bolsonaro\u2019s friend Donald Trump has now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/jair-bolsonaro-under-pressure-after-trump-bans-flights-from-brazil\" title=\"\">imposed a travel ban</a> on non-US citizens coming from Brazil. Yet the US is <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\" title=\"\">leading the world</a> for coronavirus cases and fatalities, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/27/us-coronavirus-victims-stories\" title=\"\">100,000 deaths</a>, and the toll is rising as the lockdown eases. Mr Trump brushed aside warnings of the approaching crisis, failed to prepare his country and has pushed for reopening in his desperation to see some improvement in economic conditions ahead of November\u2019s elections. Third in the tally of confirmed cases is Russia, where Vladimir Putin announced an end to the lockdown he imposed at the end of March even as infections hit a record high. More than 375,000 have now tested positive, though the death toll remains strikingly \u2013 many say suspiciously \u2013 low. Though officials <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/russia-to-hold-victory-day-parade-on-24-june-says-vladimir-putin\" title=\"\">claim</a> the rate of infections has begun to slow, the polls suggest that the Russian president, like Mr Trump and Mr Bolsonaro, is now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/he-is-failing-putins-approval-slides-as-covid-19-grips-russia\" title=\"\">paying a political price</a>.</p> <p>India is further behind, with around 150,000 cases, but catching up fast. The disastrous failure of Narendra Modi, the prime minister, to address the needs of millions of migrant workers when imposing lockdown created a humanitarian crisis and helped to facilitate the disease\u2019s spread through the country. Now he is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f86d3fda-9e72-11ea-b65d-489c67b0d85d\" title=\"\">easing restrictions</a> without introducing other effective measures such as test and trace, effectively telling Indians that they must just accept the risk.</p> <p>Last week, the World Health Organization <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/20/new-coronavirus-cases-across-the-world-jump-by-the-most-in-a-single-day-who-says.html\" title=\"\">noted</a> that these four countries accounted for two-thirds of all new cases. Instead of prioritising saving lives while finding ways to ameliorate the suffering caused by lockdowns, leaders have made the same cynical gamble: taking the shortest route to reopening their economies, blaming anyone more cautious for the lost jobs and hungry households \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/15/the-guardian-view-on-the-who-and-coronavirus-trumps-blame-game\" title=\"\">anyone convenient</a> for the death toll resulting from their own inaction.</p> <p>Abandoned by their national leaders, many states, cities, businesses and institutions have taken matters into their own hands to reduce the spread of the disease. So have individuals and communities. In Brazil\u2019s favelas, community organisers and volunteers are organising public information campaigns and hiring private medical teams.</p> <p>These welcome efforts may reduce the damage, but they cannot avert it entirely \u2013 as the rising death tolls show. These men have sold a cult of strength that mocks and dismisses the weak, yet are too feeble to shoulder the burden of responsibility. They use their power to protect not their countries but themselves. Will they ultimately pay, as their people have?</p>",

  "<p>Only 60 people have received Windrush compensation payments during the first year of the scheme\u2019s operation, with just \u00a3360,000 distributed from a fund officials expected might be required to pay out between \u00a3200m and \u00a3500m.</p> \n<p>There has been rising concern among support groups working with those affected by the Home Office scandal about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/09/why-justice-remains-elusive-for-windrush-generation\">slowness</a> of compensation offers, and about the difficulties experienced by those trying to claim.</p> \n<p>One individual has received a payment of more than \u00a3100,000, which suggests the other 59 people who have been granted compensation will have received relatively low payouts averaging \u00a34,400, according to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/windrush-compensation-scheme-data-may-2020\">figures</a> released on Thursday.

By refusing to admit that Cummings was wrong to exempt himself from lockdown rules, the government is now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/24/boris-johnson-backs-dominic-cummings-in-face-of-tory-calls-for-chief-aide-to-resign\">pouring salt into these wounds</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>In an excruciating piece of breakfast radio today, Matt Hancock was repeatedly asked if Cummings had done \u201cthe right thing\u201d by driving a carful of coronavirus to Durham. The health secretary could only say, wretchedly, that it was all within the guidelines, which is not only nonsense but the answer to a very different question. The truth is that Cummings may have flouted not just the regulations with his day trip to Barnard Castle \u2013 as Durham police have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/28/dominic-cummings-potentially-broke-lockdown-rules-say-durham-police\">reportedly concluded</a>, or the sense of social solidarity emerging over the last few months, but also a very specific, small-c conservative sense of decency and duty.&nbsp;</p> <p>That\u2019s why shire Tories are furiously buttonholing their MPs, vicars are revolting, police officers are privately fuming, and the Daily Mail is on the warpath on behalf of middle England. When told to do their moral duty for the good of the country (not least by the Queen, live from Windsor Castle), Mail readers generally do it \u2013 and vociferously judge those who don\u2019t. Defending Cummings for failing to do the same is an open gesture of contempt for the values on which the provincial and suburban, golfing and gardening, churchgoing heart of what used to be the Conservative party is founded. And simultaneously it enrages many of the new northern working-class Tory voters on which this government\u2019s majority depends.</p> <p>The people Labour\u2019s new leader must win back don\u2019t just live behind the so-called red wall, but in southern and Midland marginal towns which used to return Labour MPs in the party\u2019s winning days. Most know nothing much about Starmer yet, except that he has nice hair and once bought his mum a field for <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/i-met-keir-starmers-donkeys-and-they-told-me-something-about-him/\">her rescued donkeys</a>; but right now that beats defending the indefensible.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/28/uk-coronavirus-live-test-and-trace-gets-under-way-in-england-and-scotland\">UK coronavirus live: No 10 backs Cummings after police find possible 'minor breach' of rules</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When Starmer says the government\u2019s surcharge on migrant NHS workers for using the service themselves \u201cisn\u2019t right\u201d, or that its repeal is a victory for \u201ccommon decency\u201d, his language is music to many of these voters\u2019 ears. But it\u2019s also language that Conservative ministers are losing the moral authority to use. Hancock is right that the test-and-trace strategy will work only if complying with it is seen as a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/government-unveils-covid-19-test-and-trace-strategy-for-england\">civic duty</a>\u201d, yet the nation\u2019s response is: \u201cTell that to Dominic Cummings.\u201d</p> <p>True, there\u2019s a very long way to go, and the Tories retain a poll lead over Labour in the latest polls.&nbsp;Starmer has said nothing substantial yet about the issues that drove a wedge between Labour and some of its traditional vote at the last election, and has barely started on the Herculean task of reconciling Labour\u2019s warring factions.&nbsp;But the party is united over this one dominating issue \u2013 and more in tune than Johnson with the public mood. This is a moment that, in four years\u2019 time, we may look back on as decisive.</p> <p>Some will wonder how voters could swallow everything that has happened over the last few years \u2013 austerity, the nonsense on the side of the bus, the reckless threats to leave without a deal, even a mounting coronavirus death toll \u2013 only to strain at this relative gnat. But demanding to know why people didn\u2019t see something like this coming when they voted for Johnson is, from a party that clearly failed to offer something more appealing, the wrong question. For the first time, many people are willing at least to look again at a Labour party they rejected only a few months ago, and the last thing they want is a sanctimonious lecture about why they should have done it earlier.</p> <p>Keir Starmer has been gifted an opportunity by an opponent who doesn\u2019t even seem to realise what he is throwing away. Labour must now show that, not only does it hold the moral high ground, it is fit to govern.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist</p>",

The majority were Iranian. Figures for April are yet to be released.</p> <p>Judith Dennis, the policy manager at the Refugee Council, said: \u201cInitiating an asylum claim during a global pandemic is not easy, and we suspect there are many people in England who need to make a claim but fear a long journey on public transport to one of the four regional intake units is just too dangerous, and could put themselves and others at risk of contracting Covid-19.</p> <p>\u201cThis is very concerning, as people in this category are especially vulnerable to destitution, and cannot access any asylum support until they have made their asylum claim.\u201d</p> <p>The Home Office report says: \u201cAsylum applications, and initial decisions have both fallen sharply since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic and the beginning of restrictions in the UK.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK has continued to accept asylum applications throughout the pandemic.

  "<p>\u201cOnly those four walls know the truth,\u201d Hernando Rojas reflected, jabbing a gnarled finger into the distance, a crooked smile creasing his cheeks. \u201cBut something strange went on that day, I can assure you.\u201d</p> <p>Rojas was well into his 80s when he finally packed it in as the resident shoe shiner at Bogot\u00e1\u2019s emblematic Hotel Tequendama. But for almost 60 years he was the eyes and ears of the establishment\u2019s lobby \u2013 watching everyone, observing all. From Fidel Castro to Jimmy Carter, Neil Armstrong to Pel\u00e9, many were the stars to cross the famous foyer floor. Yet it was a blond Englishman that the octogenarian remembers best. \u201cA giant; the most elegant man I\u2019d ever seen,\u201d Rojas recalled when I saw him a few years back. \u201cBobby Moore, champion of the world.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/21/my-favourite-game-bobby-moore-displays-his-brilliance-against-brazil\">My favourite game: Bobby Moore displays his brilliance against Brazil | Tony Paley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That afternoon, 50 years ago this week, when the England captain entered Rojas\u2019s world, a mystery was born that still rumbles to this day. Entangled in myth, lies and political intrigue, dragged through the criminal underworld and spat across the international press, the tale of Bobby Moore and the missing Bogot\u00e1 bracelet threatened international relations and very nearly left England without their main man for the 1970 Mexico World Cup. But why would he have pinched it? Could it have been a prank? Did a bracelet even exist?</p> <p>It\u2019s hard now to imagine the opulence and splendour that once bathed the Tequendama. Today the discoloured wallpaper is peeling and the carpets are musty, but there is still enough faded charm about the place to evoke a nostalgic leap back to 18 May 1970 when the England team would have spilled into the hotel at around 4pm.</p> <p>Sat at one end of the lobby, Rojas and his battered toolkit of cloths, brushes and polish; at the other, the Fuego Verde jeweller\u2019s, one of four high-end boutique shops skirting the perimeter. \u201cI was over here working and they were sat over there chatting,\u201d Rojas explained. \u201cI remember them hanging around for quite some time.\u201d</p> <p>As the players sloped around waiting for their rooms to be prepared, Bobby Charlton peered through the glass window of the Fuego Verde. Spotting an emerald ring for his wife, Charlton entered the shop, Moore tailing him. A third player momentarily slouched by the door. Balking at the price, Charlton thanked the young shop assistant, the only other person present, before walking out. Both ambled back to the lobby to join their teammates.</p> <p>\u201cAll of a sudden there\u2019s this huge commotion,\u201d Rojas said. \u201cThe girl\u2019s come out of the jeweller\u2019s and I see a group of them looking for something under the chairs.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"459194f1959d7178ab53a35364e17b0c4d7abd03\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/459194f1959d7178ab53a35364e17b0c4d7abd03/0_0_2139_3077/695.jpg\" alt=\"Front page of the 27 May 1970 edition of the Guardian.\" width=\"695\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Front page of the 27 May 1970 edition of the Guardian.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The  Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Events quickly turned more dramatic as the owner of the shop, Danilo Rojas, strutted into the melee. Jabbering away in Spanish, the England players understood very little except something was missing. The shop assistant, Clara Padilla, who had only been working there for two months, pointed at Moore. The mysterious item was then identified: an 18-carat bracelet studded with 12 diamonds and 12 emeralds reportedly worth \u00a3650.</p> <p>By now voices were raised and the fuss alerted a police officer stationed at the five-star hotel\u2019s tourist office. Both Moore and Charlton were taken to one side for questioning.</p> <p>\u201cNobody knew what the hell was going on,\u201d Rojas recalled. \u201cI didn\u2019t see anyone lose their temper but the England players were clearly confused and a bit anxious \u2013 they\u2019d only been in Colombia for a couple of hours.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nobody, and I repeat nobody, other than him [Moore] could have been the author of the jewel\u2019s disappearance</p> <footer> <cite>Clara Padilla</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Tensions eventually relaxed and the players were finally handed the keys to their rooms. It was considered the end of the matter. Even the English press didn\u2019t bother reporting the incident back to their London newsdesks that night. For both players and journalists more important matters were afoot.</p> <p>England were about to play Colombia in their penultimate warm-up game, just two weeks before the World Cup was set to kick-off in Mexico. Colombia\u2019s press gushed at having a team of world champions in the country for the first time but, behind the scenes, forces were beginning to move. In an exhaustive investigation into England\u2019s time in Bogot\u00e1 for his 2014 biography, Bobby Moore: The Man in Full, Matt Dickinson describes the unfolding events like the plot from a noir thriller. And the second scene was about to begin.</p> <p>As England prepared for their friendly by training at the Military Cadets School, the police, accompanied by the Fuego Verde owner Rojas and assistant Padilla, had rolled up at the British Embassy. A bracelet was still missing. An England player had taken it. Charges would be pressed.</p> <p>England thrashed Colombia 4-0, but the following morning Moore was summoned to give another police statement, a process that also involved him clenching his fist to compare its size with the gap in the cabinet where the bracelet had once allegedly been displayed. It would not fit and Moore was free to go.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"723d3933dfb70a0f05675090717f083d17bfeaf3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/723d3933dfb70a0f05675090717f083d17bfeaf3/0_0_4774_2776/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Street vendor Alvaro Suarez who claimed to be a witness to the alleged theft (left) Danilo Rojas, owner of the Fuego Verde and Clara Padilla, an assistant at th shop.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"581\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From left: Street vendor Alvaro Suarez, who claimed to be a witness to the alleged theft; Danilo Rojas, owner of the Fuego Verde; and Clara Padilla, the shop assistant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Rolls Press/Popperfoto via Getty Images; AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>England beat Ecuador 2-0 in Quito to finish their mini-South American tour with a morale-boosting 100% record. With only one week to go before the defence of their title began against Romania, England were relaxed and confident. The next stop was Mexico, but first they had a six-hour stopover in Bogot\u00e1. Little did they know that the case against Moore had been re-opened.</p> <p>Alvaro Suarez, a 26-year-old street vendor, had appeared from the shadows claiming to be a witness. Despite inconsistencies in his story, he told police he had seen Moore sneak the bracelet into his tracksuit pocket. Danilo Rojas was now claiming the value of the bracelet, plus damages. \u201cHe might be the best footballer in the world, the most attractive, distinguished and most highly regarded of anyone, a friend of her British majesty even. But that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not a kleptomaniac,\u201d he raged.</p> <p>As England stepped off the plane at Bogot\u00e1 airport, the British Embassy informed Moore he would be required to answer a few more questions. The England captain duly obliged and left his teammates back at the Tequendama watching an old black and white film before accompanying security service agents at a downtown court where a magistrate was waiting to analyse the case.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Celebrating the birthday of one of the armed guards, Moore helped drink the house dry</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A few hours later, the rest of the squad returned to the airport to board a flight to Panama. But they were without their captain. Tired, hungry and utterly baffled, Moore had spent hours repeatedly insisting he knew nothing about the bracelet he was accused of stealing. Yet the grilling continued.</p> <p>Deep into the night the magistrate announced he had finally reached a decision \u2013 one of the world\u2019s most famous footballers, world champion and England captain, would be detained; that night Moore would be thrown into a cell.</p> <p>Hearing the news, the Colombian FA President, Alfonso Senior Quevedo, knew just how disastrous this could be and that Moore\u2019s life was now in danger. The infamous Department of Security Services jail where Moore was to be sent was located in a lawless part of town. Only a month earlier, Colombia had seen widespread fraud tarnish presidential elections. The country was angry and frustrated. Moore had stumbled into the rage of its aftermath.</p> <p>Senior pleaded with the magistrate to let the England captain stay with him under house arrest instead. The request was granted and two detectives were assigned to watch over Moore night and day while more evidence was gathered.</p> <p>News spread like wildfire. While the British prime minister, Harold Wilson, instructed diplomatic services to do all they could to secure his release, the world\u2019s press struggled to make sense of the mess. Colombian newspapers saw the incident as particularly embarrassing, defending \u201cthe English gentlemen\u201d and wincing at Colombia\u2019s reputation being dragged through the mud. \u201cWe should have more faith in his [Moore\u2019s] statements than those of the witnesses who contradict themselves and lack seriousness,\u201d argued El Tiempo, the country\u2019s main newspaper. \u201cThis farce has caused irreparable damage.\u201d</p> <p>Padilla, however, was sticking to her guns. \u201cNobody, and I repeat nobody, other than him [Moore] could have been the author of the jewel\u2019s disappearance. I\u2019m sure of that.\u201d</p> <p>On the second day of Moore\u2019s detention there was a breakthrough. In a re-enactment of the crime back at the Tequendama, with all protagonists present, Padilla repeated her story claiming she saw Moore stuff the alleged bracelet into his tracksuit pocket. Lifting his arms Moore challenged the judge to find the hiding place. There were no pockets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f148bfb2749ec6ff3ac1c43a45c7284809f39ec4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f148bfb2749ec6ff3ac1c43a45c7284809f39ec4/0_0_1260_503/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bobby Moore signs paperwork before his release and smiles as he arrives at Mexico City airport following his release from police custody\" width=\"1000\" height=\"399\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bobby Moore signs paperwork before his release and smiles as he arrives at Mexico City airport following his release from police custody.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Suarez also began to crack. It was common knowledge that the Colombian emerald trade, responsible for the majority of world production, was a crime-riddled industry controlled by mine barons who were protected by mercenary death squads. Suarez operated at the bottom of the chain, equipped with neither the brains nor experience to tackle the glaring scrutiny of his increasingly confused story. And when it was revealed that he had accepted money from shop owner Rojas for his cooperation with the case, yet more credibility dissipated.</p> <p>In customary style, Moore continued to show remarkable stoicism, despite the World Cup now being only days away. Celebrating the birthday of one of the armed guards stationed at Senior\u2019s house one night, Moore helped drink the house dry. Yet he was still up at first light to sneak out for a run and then finish a plate of ham and eggs before the guards eventually crawled out of bed nursing thunderous hangovers.</p> <p>Finally, four days before England played in Guadalajara, Judge Pedro Dorado concluded there was insufficient evidence to justify keeping Moore detained. He was free to leave the country.</p> <p>Moore stepped off the plane in Mexico City the following day to a hero\u2019s welcome. Despite the psychological torture he had just been dragged through, Moore had responded with admirable gravitas. As the media rattled jingoistic sabres back home, he simply got his head down and focused on the task at hand. Just over a week after battling the Colombian justice system, Moore led England out against Brazil and put in a dazzling performance. Both on and off the pitch, he demonstrated inviolable inner strength.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"83b7797144f69252c19f199c07e4bb9354784051\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83b7797144f69252c19f199c07e4bb9354784051/0_0_2550_1880/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bobby Moore shields the ball from Brazil\u2019s Carlos Alberto.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"737\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bobby Moore shields the ball from Brazil\u2019s Carlos Alberto.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Popperfoto via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In August 1970, Colombia\u2019s chief of police admitted Moore had probably fallen foul of a conman\u2019s extortion trick: an exotic jewel used as bait in a fancy hotel frequented by the rich and powerful. Fifty years on, it remains the most likely theory. Yet the embers of doubt still smoulder, not least because the case has never been fully explained.</p> <p>One of the main counter theories has been propagated by his biographer and friend Jeff Powell. Both East End lads, Powell suggested Moore had confessed before his death in 1993 that a bracelet may have indeed existed: \u201cPerhaps one of the younger lads with the squad did something foolish, a prank with unfortunate circumstances.\u201d</p> <p>Five decades on and one of the few people alive still connected to the case is Pedro Bonnet, the Fuego Verde lawyer.

Figures compiled by <a href=\"https://www.apmresearchlab.org/covid/deaths-by-race\">APM Research Lab</a> from 40 states show that African Americans are being killed at almost three times the rate of white people.</p> <p>Black Kansans are <a href=\"https://www.apmresearchlab.org/covid/deaths-by-race\">seven times</a> more likely to die from the virus than white Kansans.

Many low-income New Yorkers in the outer boroughs are obliged to risk their lives by turning up for work every day, branded as \u201cessential workers\u201d, while Manhattan\u2019s wealthy neighborhoods have become virtual ghost towns after their residents fled to vacation homes.</p> <p>It will take time for the full extent of mortality among low-income Americans to be known, but anecdotally it is clear the <a href=\"https://publicintegrity.org/health/coronavirus-and-inequality/pre-existing-inequality-could-make-coronavirus-hit-some-harder/\">poorest counties</a> have been hit hardest. That\u2019s evident in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/12/coronavirus-us-deep-south-poverty-race-perfect-storm\">southern states</a> such as Louisiana and Alabama where low-income people have been dying in high proportions through a combination of lack of health insurance, hospital closures and policies pursued by southern governors that have exposed vulnerable citizens to danger.</p> <p>There is nothing new in any of this for the beleaguered souls now feeling the full force of the virus\u2019s wrath.

Over the last six weeks there has been an explosion of conspiracy theories on social media, epitomized by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/coronavirus-viral-video-plandemic-judy-mikovits-conspiracy-theories\">Plandemic</a> documentary, which claimed a cabal led by Bill Gates were exploiting the virus to seize power.</p> <p>Wardle has been surprised how quickly conspiracy theories have erupted into the mainstream. \u201cYou have high school friends and mums and aunts who would never normally share this material now on it.\u201d</p> <p>Wardle sees the vast proliferation of misinformation as a result of deep uncertainty about the pandemic, combined with a paucity of quality information following the collapse of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-us-newspapers-impact\">US news industry</a>, which has itself been accelerated by the virus\u2019 economic impact.</p> <p>Bad information cost lives. It can encourage states to reopen their economies precipitously and lure individuals to drop their guard and expose themselves to the virus.</p> <p>Wardle said: \u201cHistorians are going to look back on all of this and have a much clearer idea of how misinformation led to real-world harm \u2013 and death.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Details have emerged of more than 30 migrants&nbsp;allegedly&nbsp;robbed, beaten and spray-painted with red crosses on their heads by Croatian police officers who said the treatment was the \u201ccure against coronavirus\u201d.</p> <p>The Guardian has interviewed asylum seekers, obtained photographs and collected dozens of testimonies, including from minors, revealing how the Croatian authorities were laughing and drinking beer while spray-painting migrants attempting to cross the border from Bosnia-Herzegovina, as EU parliamentarians have now begun pushing for an independent commission of inquiry to investigate the abuses.</p> <p>According to migrants\u2019 accounts, confirmed by numerous charities, at least two groups of migrants were apprehended by military personnel and handed over to police between 6 and 7 May near the Slovenian border, on route 61 in the area of Rijeka.</p> <p>\u201cWe were caught at 3am by a couple of military guys in a green uniform,\u201d said a migrant from Pakistan. \u201cThey searched us to make sure we were not smuggling anything and then they called the police. A police van with four officers in black uniforms arrived. They crammed us into the van and took us to a police station where we were photographed. They made us sign some paper. We asked for asylum but they told us to shut up.\u201d</p> <p>That night at the police station, Croatian officers would have allegedly taken in dozens of asylum seekers, predominantly from Pakistan and Afghanistan, who were captured in different locations. Following these events, about 4pm on 7 May the Croatian police allegedly piled them into four vans and drove them near to the border with Bosnia.</p> <p>\u201cOur group was in a van with a glass partition from which I saw the van stop at a store where they bought beer,\u201d said another man from Pakistan. \u201cThey were drinking along the way before we stopped near a small river close to Velika Kladu\u0161a.\u201d</p> <p>According to the migrants, that is where the abuse began. The police allegedly asked them to get out of the van one by one. Then, with a spray can, they began painting crosses on their heads and faces.</p> <p>\u201cThey made crosses on our heads and on some guys they coloured their moustaches or foreheads,\u201d said an asylum seeker. \u201cThey then made us take off our clothes and shoes, took our money and mobile phones and set fire to our clothes and belongings. Around 10 of them stood in a line and made us walk past them while they beat us with wooden sticks and police batons. After this they pushed us into the river and told us not to come back.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0cde42667e511ee2477159f6d172f1609b2ec92a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0cde42667e511ee2477159f6d172f1609b2ec92a/0_0_2428_1600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"migrants spray painted by the Croatian police\" width=\"1000\" height=\"659\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Danish Refugee Council has collected testimonies from many of the alleged victims</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Danish Refugee Council</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of the 33 people interviewed by the Danish&nbsp;Refugee&nbsp;Council (DRC),&nbsp;one of the main responders providing healthcare for migrants in Bosnia-Herzegovina,&nbsp;\u201c29 reported being beaten with police batons.

While these incidents are truly shocking, they unfortunately seem to fall into a pattern of abuse consistently reported by refugees and migrants attempting to cross the border between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia.\u201d</p> <p>In April alone, DRC teams in Bosnia-Herzegovina recorded 1,641 cases of refugees and migrants pushed back to Bosnia from Croatia. Of these, 891 reported being subjected to violence or physical assault; 1,253 reported having their belongings confiscated or destroyed (set on fire); 871 people said they\u2019d had identity documents confiscated or destroyed by Croatian police; 445 people said they had been denied access to asylum procedures in Croatia, despite having explicitly requested it.</p> <p>Contacted by the Guardian, the Croatian police and the Croatian interior ministry did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p> <p>However, after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/12/croatian-police-accused-of-shaving-and-spray-painting-heads-of-asylum-seekers\">Guardian reported</a> the Croatian police\u2019s spray-painting of migrants on 12 May, the country\u2019s interior minister drafted a lengthy rebuttal on the ministry\u2019s website, calling the allegations \u201ccompletely absurd\u201d and accusing the Guardian of organising a \u201cpre-meditated attack against the Republic of Croatia\u201d.</p> <p>Following that report, a group of EU parliamentarians in Brussels is pushing for an independent commission of inquiry to investigate the abuses. \u201cWe believe the European Commission should join the investigation efforts of the UN to stop the alleged abuse and hold the perpetrators accountable for their actions,\u201d reads an internal memo circulating among MEPs. \u201cIf these allegations prove to be true, this is a serious case of abuse and in clear violation of the Schengen Border Code.

It is an utter scandal, a shameful abandonment of everything they claim to stand over in terms of respect for fundamental rights. Shame on them.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the protests of journalists, charities and even the UNHCR, all calling for an investigation into the alleged abuses of migrants at the hands of the Croatian police, the EU has not intervened.</p> <p>\u201cThe only conclusion you can reach about why they are silent is that as long as the borders are reinforced, then human rights obligations can be conveniently ignored,\u2019\u2019 said Daly. \u201cFor business reasons they are keen on the extension of Schengen and if refugees and migrants are sacrificed in delivering that then clearly for them, so be it. It makes me sick and ashamed to be a member of an EU which would operate in this way. I have no doubt whatsoever that the commission is fully aware that the allegations are correct and they have sacrificed refugees and migrants and their obligations under international law, in the interests of extending Schengen for big business &amp; geo-political reasons. [They] will not be allowed to get away with this, accountability must prevail, or the EU is over.\u201d</p> <p>In an email the Croatian Ministry of the Interior denied&nbsp;police had acted violently towards migrants, but added that \u201can extensive investigation of the allegations\u201d would be conducted.</p> <p>The email suggested migrants could have fabricated the news. \u201cWe find it highly probable that thousands of migrants are ready to use all means at their disposal to accomplish their goal, including giving false testimonies against police officers,\u201d it said. \u201cWhen lacking evidence, the simplest and easiest thing to do is to fabricate events which never happened or to portray real events in a distorted manner.\u201d</p>",

My boyfriend and I had been motorbiking around India for several months and had experienced many pitfalls. On our way down this mountain the only road was blocked by landslides.

We ate the most delicious tarka dal and rice, followed by handfuls of fresh snow peas from the truck. They even provided rum!<br><strong>Tabitha Ward</strong></p> <h2>Perfect tandoori fish, Yemen</h2> <p>One of the best meals I ever had was in a restaurant in Sanaa, the largest city in Yemen.

The borders were closed two days later and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2016/sep/04/hygge-denmark-danes-cosiness-wealth-antidepressants-scandinavians\">Denmark\u2019s famous </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2016/sep/04/hygge-denmark-danes-cosiness-wealth-antidepressants-scandinavians\">hygge</a></em> was put to the test as Danes were forced to stay home (although no restrictions were placed on outdoor exercise). As a rule-abiding bunch, Danes trusted that the government had their best interests at heart and so did as they were told. Every Saturday during lockdown, locals flew the Danish flag in solidarity and instead of clapping for health workers, Denmark\u2019s answer to TV choirmaster Gareth Malone led <em>Daily Morgensang</em> (Daily Morning Song) on TV station DR1 to keep morale up. And it worked. Prime minister Mette Frederiksen\u2019s hard and fast coronavirus strategy paid off \u2013 in a country of 5.8 million, the number of Covid-19 deaths stands at just <a href=\"https://www.sst.dk/da/corona-eng/covid-19-update_-statistics-and-charts\">563</a> at time of writing and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-denmark/second-virus-wave-very-unlikely-in-denmark-says-expert-idUSKBN22O15L\">infection rates are low</a> (0.7).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2139aeba3dfc34dac98111a16a298ba5a163fbf6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2139aeba3dfc34dac98111a16a298ba5a163fbf6/0_246_5315_3191/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Schoolchildren have their lunch in Randers, Denmark\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Pupils from different classes are assigned different entrances and no parents are allowed inside the school.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bo Amstrup/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Curve duly flattened, Denmark was the first country in Europe to reopen primary schools \u2013 as well as kindergartens and day-care institutions \u2013 in mid-April, following the advice that young children were the <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/health/2020-05-12/kids-cornavirus-symptoms-spread-schools-kawasaki/12236614\">least at risk</a>. Some were nervous at the idea of sending small children out to test the water, but after five weeks of supposedly \u201cworking from home\u201d with three kindergarteners, I was tempted. With work Zoom calls regularly gatecrashed by Elsa from Frozen and bare bottoms (lockdown brought out the nudist in my kids), my husband and I decided to go for it. Socialising young children is considered crucial in Denmark and as one psychologist friend put it: \u201cWe like the idea that children are brought up not only by their parents but by a whole society, including teachers, school friends, grandparents etc. They learn different perspectives from different relationships.\u201d He added: \u201cI also like the idea that I\u2019m not the only one responsible for their development and wellbeing.\u201d </p> <p>Danes worked out quickly that social distancing was impossible with young children, who essentially lick everything they see. Instead, kids stay in \u201cprotective bubbles\u201d \u2013 keeping to their own zones in the playground in small groups and sticking with the same teacher. Pupils from different classes are assigned different entrances and no parents are allowed inside the school. There are no face masks \u2013 for pupils or teachers; lessons are outside whenever possible, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/keep-it-clean-the-surprising-130-year-history-of-handwashing\">handwashing</a> is hourly (eczema flare-ups abound). Teachers sport hand-sanitiser sprays like cowboys in a weird western and all equipment is disinfected several times a day.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/17/denmark-can-teach-england-safe-reopening-of-schools-covid-19\">Split classes, outdoor lessons: what Denmark can teach England about reopening schools after Covid-19</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Denmark\u2019s schools started off with a two-metre social distancing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/17/denmark-can-teach-england-safe-reopening-of-schools-covid-19\">rule</a>, but this has now been reduced to one metre and dropped entirely for kindergarteners. From 18 May, kids aged 11-plus returned to school, and they were also separated into smaller groups. This has been a logistical challenge but teachers have already seen the better teacher/child ratio as beneficial to behaviour \u2013 and kids polled say they\u2019re glad to be back, following the isolation of home schooling.</p> <p>Many adults, by contrast, are content to still be working from home (without distractions). Denmark was already renowned for its work-life balance, but lockdown life has highlighted the importance of flexibility for employees. Some office workers are returning to their desks a few days a week, but there\u2019s a sense that employers can no longer demand the same presenteeism or demanding commutes as before. Meeting face to face isn\u2019t always necessary and shaking hands \u2013 previously a stalwart of Danish etiquette, done with everyone from your GP to your dentist and every member of a social gathering \u2013 is now a thing of the past.</p> <p>I can live without handshakes. What I miss are hugs, from friends. Socialising online made many of us strangely intimate. We didn\u2019t know when we\u2019d next see each other and so we opened up, skipping the small talk. Once we were officially allowed to socialise again in small groups, it was strange at first, tuning into friends in real life and talking about things other than coronavirus. But after the initial awkwardness, it was \u2026 brilliant (and blurry. Sore heads all around the next day). When restaurants and bars reopened, we emerged, blinking, from our homes, conscious of trying to keep up the meaningful connections that were somehow easier and more frequent when \u201cnormal life\u201d wasn\u2019t in the way.</p> <p>Danes have now been advised that they can see and even hug grandparents again, but for those with very elderly relatives or in at risk groups, the isolation continues. Hospitals are coping, but the threat of coronavirus means that anyone admitted is tested for Covid-19 as a matter of course and no visitors are allowed. I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll see family in the UK since borders are still <a href=\"https://www.visitdenmark.com/denmark/travel-essentials/coronavirus\">closed to foreign visitors</a> (with some exceptions). But for the majority of those living Danishly, the silence of lockdown has been a time to re-evaluate \u2013 to notice things, good and bad, take stock, break habits and start over.

In a statement, a spokesman said the guidelines \u201caim to deal compassionately, sensitively and consistently with survivors of child sexual abuse\u201d and that settlements involved a personal apology to victims.</p> <p>But NSW Labor says it will push the government to provide answers on whether any steps have been taken to seek other potential victims.</p> <p>The earliest alleged offending discovered by lawyers acting for victims dated to 1973, the year O\u2019Connor became the principal of the local high school in Gilgandra, a town about 67km north of Dubbo in the state\u2019s west.</p> <p>By then, O\u2019Connor had worked as a teacher and deputy principal for more than two decades in Gunnedah, Lithgow and the small town of Corowa near the Victorian border.</p> <p>On Thursday Penny Sharpe, Labor\u2019s deputy opposition leader in the upper house, said the Guardian\u2019s reporting raised serious concerns about the way departments handled child sex abuse claims.</p> <p>Sharpe questioned whether there should be an onus on departments to investigate the possibility of further victims in cases where there are multiple claims against one employee.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a disturbing story,\u201d she said. \u201cThe minister has serious questions to answer about this whole tragic affair.</p> <p>\u201cThe most important question is if there are more victims out there, what action has been taken by the department of education to try and find them.\u201d</p> <p>According to NSW Greens MP David Shoebridge, the Guardian\u2019s investigation also raised issues about the use of confidentiality clauses by state departments during civil cases. Most of the 14 cases uncovered by the Guardian included confidentiality clauses over the value of the payout.</p> <p>The Guardian understands those clauses were agreed to with the consent of both parties, and in a statement the department of education said it had not publicised O\u2019Connor\u2019s name or the alleged abuse because it was \u201cnot requested to make the matter public\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe department communicated through its lawyers with the lawyers for the claimants\u2019 and dealt with the matters sensitively in accordance with the requests of the claimants\u2019 lawyers,\u201d a spokesman said.</p> <p>But the victims who spoke to the Guardian during the investigation said they did not remember asking for confidentiality agreements, nor did they wish for O\u2019Connor\u2019s name to remain secret.</p> <p>Shoebridge said the common use of confidentiality clauses by government departments at both the state and federal level should be banned in cases where the claimant does not specifically request it.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think governments should ever be able to use confidentiality clauses to hush up where public money goes, and, as this case shows, to hush up offending committed by the state,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt is an outrageous breach of trust with the public and it is routine in settlements of compensation cases by not only state governments&nbsp;but also the commonwealth. It does two things; it protects wrongdoers and avoids political embarrassment, but it also fails to notify the public and means other victims don\u2019t&nbsp;come forward.\u201d</p>",

<p>South Australia has called a halt to granting international travel exemptions on compassionate grounds after SA Health bungled the case of a British woman who arrived on the weekend and tested positive to Covid-19.</p> \n  <p>Premier <strong> Steven Marshall </strong>says he wants to get to the bottom of the problem, which resulted in the woman presenting herself to authorities on arrival in Adelaide rather than being met by health officials, before allowing any further international travellers into SA in such circumstances.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we should be granting any further exemptions for overseas travel to South Australia until we\u2019ve ironed out this administrative error,\u201d Mr Marshall said on Thursday.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to make sure we have airtight systems going forward before we grant further exemptions for people coming from overseas.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But Marshall said he did not intend to \u201chang SA Health out to dry\u201d and praised the department\u2019s overall handling of the pandemic as well as the previous arrival of international travellers.</p> \n  <p>The premier also confirmed police commissioner Grant Stevens would meet the SA Health chief executive to develop new arrangements for future transfers.<br></p> \n  <p>Before Sunday\u2019s case, 21 other people had come to SA from overseas on compassionate grounds, about half to attend a funeral and the others to visit a dying relative.</p> \n  <p>The British woman, in her 50s, was granted her exemption to visit a dying relative.<br></p> \n  <p>She had spent about a week in quarantine in Victoria after arriving in Australia from the UK and had tested negative while in isolation.</p> \n  <p>She wore a mask while travelling to SA and made herself known to airport authorities and was then escorted out by police.</p> \n  <p>When tested again, she returned the positive result, becoming the state\u2019s 440th case of Covid-19 and the first for almost three weeks.</p> \n  <p>The woman was returned to quarantine while almost 20 close contacts were also ordered into self-isolation.</p> \n  <p>After initially saying Victorian officials did not tell them when the woman would arrive, chief public health Officer <strong>Nicola Spurrier </strong>issued a statement on Thursday conceding the flight information was passed on.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cDue to an administrative oversight, we can confirm the relevant flight details involving an overseas traveller arriving in South Australia were provided to SA Health prior to their arrival,\u201d Spurrier said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWhat this issue has highlighted is the need to strengthen the processes involving travellers arriving from overseas and travelling between states during their quarantine period.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>After SA\u2019s initial comments, Victorian chief health officer <strong>Brett Sutton</strong> said South Australia was told of the woman\u2019s travel details and he had the email to prove it.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure why there is a misunderstanding about having been informed, but that email was sent and South Australian authorities were alerted about the time and flight details,\u201d Sutton said.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T04:14:10.397Z\">at 5.14am BST</time></p>

My personal view, looking at what\u2019s happened with health, it\u2019s allowed us to strike the private hospitals agreement, it\u2019s allowed us to strike the public hospitals agreement. <br></p> \n   <p>It\u2019s allowed us to work with the public health units on the contact tracing.

The abuser uses violence and intimidation to restrict access to a person\u2019s bank accounts, prevent them from working or accessing benefits, or withholds living expenses from them or their children. <br></p> \n  <p>Austrac\u2019s CEO, <strong>Nicole Rose </strong>PSM, said having a bank account independent of an abuser was essential for those who are leaving or have left an abusive relationship. This rule supports our regulated businesses to uphold their AML/CTF obligations while adopting a flexible approach to customer identity processes.<br></p> \n  <p>Austrac collaborated on the rule change with the Australian Banking Association and the Australian Israel Chamber of Commerce NSW who initiated the project and identified the opening of bank accounts as a significant barrier.

This is directly related to the level of pre-pandemic income support payments.</li> \n   <li>The single rate of Newstart in January 2018 (including rent assistance and energy supplement) was $117pw below the poverty line ($185pw if they did not receive rent assistance). Youth allowance (plus these supplements) was $164pw below the poverty line ($232pw without rent assistance).</li> \n   <li>Households that have to rely mainly on social security payments (eg unemployment, parenting, and disability payments) are five times more likely to experience poverty (36%) than those receiving most income from wages and salaries (7%). However, 38% of those in poverty are in wage-earning households; the majority of whom are households with children.</li> \n   <li>In households where the main earner is a female, the poverty rate is 19% \u2013 almost double the rate when the main earner is male \u2013 10%. </li> \n   <li>In single parent families in which the main earner is a woman the rate of poverty (37%) is twice that in which the main earner is a man (18%).</li> \n   <li>The biggest differences in poverty rates between households with male and female main earners are in families with children. The average poverty rate among people in families with children where the main income-earner is female is 23%, compared with 10% where the main income-earner is male (which is the more common arrangement). In contrast, among households without children, the average poverty rate where the main income-earner is female is 12%, compared with 10% where the main income-earner is male.</li> \n   <li>Nearly half the children in sole parent families live in poverty (44%) compared with 13% for children living with both parents.</li> \n   <li>While those of working age are at greater risk of poverty than older people, over 65s who are living in private rental face a relatively high risk of poverty (41%).</li> \n   <li> Renters are almost twice as likely to live in poverty as home-owners (19% compared with 9%) with public housing tenants at greatest risk (58%).</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>You can read the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/Poverty2020pt2\">whole report here</a>. <br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T00:01:37.126Z\">at 1.01am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecee3f58f0898700351d85f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-27T22:07:26.544Z\">11.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Australian Council of Social Services has released a report \u2013 Poverty in Australia 2020: Part 2 \u2013 Who is affected? <em>\u2013 </em>which looks at the impact of poverty before the Covid-19 crisis.</p> \n  <p>Its findings, unfortunately shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise to anyone. As the acting Acoss CEO, <strong>Jacqueline Phillips</strong>,<strong> </strong>says:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><strong>This report exposes the disproportionate impact of poverty on households in which women are the main income earners. These households are twice as likely to live in poverty as those in which men are the main income earners (19% and 10%, respectively), with the gap even higher in households with children (at 23% and 10% respectively).</strong></p> \n   <p> Disturbingly, more than a third of single mothers and their children are living in poverty (37%). The challenges faced by single mothers that lead to so many being on low incomes have serious implications for the wellbeing of those women and their children.</p> \n   <p>Early indications suggest that women have been suffering some of the worst economic impacts of the current pandemic, and effective policy action is needed to ensure this does not translate into an ongoing reduction in female employment or an increase in poverty amongst women and children. A snapback on childcare or income support risks trapping single mothers and their children in poverty.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-27T23:59:58.446Z\">at 12.59am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecedd6f8f087e3ca0f64ae2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-27T21:36:56.374Z\">10.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Rugby League is back.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NRL/status/1265756229772603397\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">May 28.<br><br>That\u2019s it.

  "<p>What kind of crime fiction suits the mood of the lockdown? There\u2019s a limit to how mean the streets can get when walked down in dutiful daily exercise; sparse clues to be found when everyone is taking strict precautions like seasoned serial killers. But at a time so closely focused on the vicissitudes of home life, DI Manon Bradshaw of Cambridgeshire Constabulary is on hand to examine the existential mystery of domesticity.</p> <p><em>Remain Silent</em> is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/07/missing-presumed-review-susie-steiner\">third in a series</a> featuring this formidable Fenland sleuth, a wide-hipped, loose-lipped realist who cares little for others\u2019 approval and admires \u201cwomen who command the room and who don\u2019t succumb to all the appearance bullshit\u201d. This time Manon is investigating the death by hanging of a Lithuanian migrant worker, but her life away from the job is where the real trouble is. There\u2019s the constant fatigue of the work-life balance, the soul-draining tedium of household chores and arguments \u2013 plus she\u2019s struggling to keep the relationship with her partner Mark alive, knowing that cold comfort might be the best they can expect. As she tells a friend\u2019s errant husband: \u201cMarriage is a shit-show and you\u2019d better start learning a way to navigate it.\u201d</p> <p>Manon\u2019s world is a stark contrast to the grim milieu of the migrant Lithuanians. With harsh working conditions, violent gangmasters and squalid lodgings, the irony is that they seek the dull quotidian that eats away at Manon. Explaining an intrigue with a frumpy English neighbour, one admits: \u201cIt isn\u2019t the sex, actually, with Elspeth. It\u2019s the clean bed, it smells so good.\u201d But an affair his friend has with the daughter of one of the local anti-immigration group leads to a brutal episode of domestic violence. In extremis, home is where the hurt is.</p> <p>With multiple narratives and much internal commentary, <em>Remain Silent</em> can seem a bit too discursive at times. But Manon holds it all together, solving crime while digressing on feminism and comfort eating (it\u2019s no surprise that the denouement rests on the consumption of a lasagne). She is an ideal protagonist for our times, not a goddess but a detective of the domestic, interrogating what is essential or non-essential in everyday life.<br></p> <p>\u2022 <em>Jake Arnott\u2019s latest novel is</em> <em>The Fatal Tree</em> <em>(Sceptre).

  "<p>\u201cI am at present off work with anxiety, panic attacks and stress; I was redeployed and asked to go into the community with no PPE at all \u2026 I felt I was putting my family at risk and was undervalued, and now feel like leaving nursing altogether.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cI, like many others, feel the need to isolate myself from my family because I don\u2019t want to bring this home to my mid-50s husband. I miss my young children so much I can\u2019t focus \u2026 I really wish I wasn\u2019t a doctor.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cI feel completely depressed, stressed and showered with Covid-19 after more than a month of doing this. I am anxious about all the patients and feel guilty about any who die. Can\u2019t see how I can keep doing this and working outside my comfort zone.\u201d</p> \n<p>These are just some of the testimonies we have heard from healthcare workers across the UK, as part of our research at the Royal College of Surgeons into the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on mental health.</p> \n<p>A perfect storm is gathering. Previous research has shown that <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5537573/\">stress-related psychiatric illness</a> may be prevalent in up to 50% of UK doctors and 40% of nurses. A 2019 study of more than 4,000 doctors and medical students showed that <a href=\"https://archive.bma.org.uk/news/media-centre/press-releases/2019/may/serious-mental-health-crisis-among-doctors-and-medical-students-revealed-in-bma-report\">80% of doctors had experienced burnout</a> and 33% regularly or occasionally used alcohol, drugs or self-medication as coping mechanisms. It is a vicious circle: the mental health burden on healthcare workers has been associated with suboptimal patient care and increased errors, potentially compromising patient safety. And then came Covid-19.</p> \n<p>Our ongoing research has found that out of 868 UK healthcare workers surveyed, more than 60% have felt down, depressed or hopeless during the pandemic; nearly 80% have had sleeping difficulties; and 60% have felt lonely. As a frontline clinician who was redeployed to intensive care, I have seen this first hand. There are a number of contributing factors: from healthcare workers being redeployed and thus working in areas outside their comfort zone, to the difficult conversations with family members, as patients are palliated, deemed not suitable for a ventilator.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2763229\">toll on nurses</a> in particular needs to be highlighted, with intensive care unit (ICU) nurses in certain NHS trusts often managing two to three sick patients with coronavirus on ventilators, for up to 12 hours, in PPE which, from personal experience, can be extremely uncomfortable and claustrophobic. There have been issues surrounding lack of adequate PPE around the country, the effects of widespread media coverage of their work, and feelings of being inadequately supported. The health service has also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/doctors-nurses-porters-volunteers-the-uk-health-workers-who-have-died-from-covid-19\">mourned</a> the death of 200 healthcare workers and there is widespread fear and anxiety among many of becoming infected themselves and passing the virus on to their loved ones. For many junior doctors, postgraduate exams and recruitment interviews have been cancelled and training has been severely disrupted.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"480d1656-ca71-4050-91e8-119eeea78569\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yaoB0GPuxZ8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Despite the hardships the pandemic has brought, some trusts have responded by prioritising wellbeing support for their healthcare workers. This includes meeting physical needs, such as providing free food, parking and accommodation, as well as making sure scrubs are available for all staff. \u201cWellbeing hubs\u201d have been set up, providing the opportunity for staff to rest and recuperate. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/psychologist-tells-frontline-nhs-staff-its-ok-not-to-be-ok\">Counselling services</a> and psychologists have been made available for healthcare workers, as well as access to chaplaincy and bereavement support.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/25/nhs-surcharge-migrant-staff-government-campaign\">The NHS surcharge for migrant staff is gone.

In my own hospital in London, we have an ICU psychologist to support and talk to healthcare workers on a one-to-one basis, on the phone or via Skype \u2013 can the same be said of hospitals across the country? \u201cIn general, we have been very well supported. However, I don\u2019t think this is representative across all trusts in the UK,\u201d one doctor told me.</p> \n<p>The 2003 Sars epidemic was associated with <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17500304/\">increased rates of stress</a> (that persisted one year later), depression, anxiety, insomnia and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among healthcare workers. Coronavirus may affect UK healthcare workers similarly, having wreaked havoc on the health service, with unprecedented demands on the workforce, many of whom are at breaking point.</p> \n<p>Government and policymakers need to act now to support the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/01/nhs-staff-mental-health-services-coronavirus-labour\">mental wellbeing of healthcare workers</a> throughout all phases of this pandemic. Wellness hubs in hospitals need to be widely available, with virtual consultations and talking therapies, PTSD support and access to psychologists. We need to raise awareness of national support services such as the Samaritans and Mind, as well as screen and target the most vulnerable (eg those with pre-existing mental health problems). Taking action now will be crucial to curb an impending mental health epidemic in the UK.</p> \n<p>\u2022 In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a>.

  "<p>As a form of physical activity, it is easy to dismiss walking as, well, pedestrian. But now its benefits, both physical and mental, are being appreciated once again. Under lockdown, daily walks became sacred. Now they are the safest way to commute, and, for those stuck at home, there is little place else to go other than to wander the streets, forests, towpaths, cemeteries and eerily deserted business quarters.</p> <p>We have become nosy tourists in our own neighbourhoods. We seek out less-travelled backwaters, eyeing curiously the fragments of human and animal lives that we pass, gazing on seasonal changes like besotted new parents. But are we walking to the best of our abilities? Possibly not. Sports scientist Joanna Hall has dedicated her career to coaching people in how to walk the way their bodies were designed to, which no longer comes easily in this sedentary, screen-based era.</p> <p>\u201cI approach this as you would do if you wanted to get better at tennis,\u201d she says. She developed her <a href=\"https://www.joannahall.net/\">Walk Active</a> programme to enable people to ease their aches and pains as they exercise, rather than exacerbate them. Lifestyle, ageing and injuries mean that when we put one foot in front of the other, the way we use our muscles may be, she says, \u201csuboptimal for improving our posture, or reducing joint strain and getting the most out of walking\u201d.</p> <p>According to Hall, there are four common aspects we get wrong, and each has knock-on effects on the body. Firstly, instead of propelling ourselves forwards by pushing off with the back foot, like an ice-skater, we try to use our stepping foot to power us along. This is because sitting down too much has made our hip flexor muscles short and tight. Hall describes the necessary adjustment as the subtle difference between stepping into a space (wrong) and pushing off from a space, which will recruit the right muscles up the backs of your legs. \u201cYou use your glutes and you open up the core,\u201d says Hall.</p> <p>The second problem is what Hall calls a passive foot strike. The movement provided by the joints in our feet offers suspension and balance but we often plod along flatly instead, leaving us compromised. \u201cThat\u2019s what causes knee discomfort,\u201d says Hall. \u201cIt can create slight misalignment of the back, stiffness of the shoulders.\u201d</p> <p>The third thing to watch out for is letting your head hang forwards. Screens, reading and desk work have made this the default position, which is a bit of a disaster. \u201cWhen the head is slightly forward,\u201d says Hall, \u201cthe muscles of the upper back and the shoulders have to contract to hold it there. The shoulders come forward and can stiffen. Back mobility becomes restricted and you will not be able to rotate your spine from the hips.\u201d Try lifting your head before looking over your shoulder and you may discover, as I did, that you can turn your head much further all of a sudden.</p> <p>Finally, our arms tend to hang awkwardly or we force them into tense, power-walk movements, when what they want is to dangle freely. If you get steps one to three right, this should happen naturally. Hall has devised various drills to help correct these bad habits, such as measuring with your hand the gap between your bottom rib and your hip, and between your collarbone and your earlobe, and then adjusting your posture to lengthen those gaps. Walking with her tips in mind has made me feel lighter; more gazelle than galumph.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df9e3a2301c8999af213e13bfc1baa249af5ef06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df9e3a2301c8999af213e13bfc1baa249af5ef06/0_374_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Friends having a conversation while walking in the park\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Walking in step is like a physically distanced hug.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marilyn Nieves/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now that lockdown rules have eased, we can get some desperately needed time with friends or family members. Yes, not being allowed to hug is painful, but physically distanced walking together is the next best thing. This is because when two people walk together, they unconsciously fall into step. As a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep00959\">2012 study</a> by US and Japanese researchers found, when people move in sync together, their neural activity synchronises too. The more in sync we are, the deeper our social connection, so walking in step is pretty much a physically distanced hug.</p> <p>Walking has long been hailed as an aid to creativity, too, by big thinkers from Aristotle to Wordsworth to Stanford University behavioural scientist Marily Ann Oppezzo. In 2018, Oppezzo and her colleagues, who study creativity, published research that set out to demonstrate this lightbulb effect. Participants who brainstormed while walking thought of significantly more valid ideas than those who tried to do the same while sitting.</p> <p>So if you have to attend a (socially-distanced) brainstorming meeting, says Oppezzo, \u201cgo think about ideas beforehand while walking.\u201d Brainstorming in groups, she says, is far less productive.</p> <p>If you need to maximise the potential of a creative walk \u2013 perhaps you are finally starting that novel while quarantining \u2013 she suggests picking a problem or topic beforehand and thinking about potential new perspectives on it while you walk. Rather than taking a \u201cdeep dive\u201d, she says, walking is great for taking a stroll around a subject, seeing it from different sides and coming up with new ideas.</p> <p>She recommends travelling at a comfortable pace, so your physical exertion needs minimal attention, and coming up with as many ideas as you can, rather than trying to lock on to the first one you have. And if the ideas aren\u2019t flowing, don\u2019t force it. Come back to it another time.</p> <p>Crucially, in the study, she had participants record their ideas, rather than write them down, \u201cbecause the idea of writing something down is already a filter \u2013 is this good enough to write down? You can put your headphones on and record through your phone.\u201d And if you are feeling self-conscious, the headphones allow you to pretend to passers-by that you\u2019re having a phone conversation.</p> <p>As well as percolating the cerebral juices, there are powerful mental-health benefits to be gained from walking. Half an hour of walking per day has been found to be as helpful as more intense 20-minute workouts in <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/regular-walking-can-help-ease-depression/\">treating depression</a>. <a href=\"http://hoda.ie/\">Hugh O\u2019Donovan, a psychologist based in Cork</a>, wrote about the beneficial effects in his 2015 book Mindful Walking: Walk Your Way to Mental and Physical Well-Being. Walking provides what he calls \u201cnatural meds\u201d, and there are no rules. Do you want to walk alone or with others? Do you listen to music or the outside world? Right now, enjoying the variety of options is key. \u201cYou have different locations and different routes,\u201d says O\u2019Donovan. \u201cYou can pick up the pace when you like, or you can slow down and be a bit more mindful. It doesn\u2019t really matter. It\u2019s just the fact that you\u2019re doing it.\u201d</p> <p>To reinforce the positive effects, he suggests \u201cexperimenting with noticing how you\u2019re feeling. Is it lifting my mood? Am I meeting people and socialising a little?\u201d However you prefer to walk, he invites you to \u201ccome to your senses. This is profoundly important because much of the time we\u2019re on autopilot. We\u2019re unconscious, unaware of what\u2019s going on around us. There\u2019s magic all around us all the time but we\u2019re too busy.\u201d Coronavirus has slowed life down, perhaps making it a little easier to pay attention. \u201cWhat are you seeing, smelling, tasting?\u201d he asks. \u201cThe world looks like a completely different place when you bring this quality of curiosity to everything you do. People underestimate its value.\u201d</p> <p>While walking helps oil the cogs of the mind, and can help you get perspective if you\u2019re struggling with something seismic such as grief, a job loss or the uncertainty of life under Covid-19, it pays to be aware of the risks of rumination. Namely, says O\u2019Donovan, \u201cthe error and bias that\u2019s associated with thinking, which lead us down a slippery slope into catastrophising and predicting the future negatively.\u201d How can you avoid repeating the unhelpful and yet perfectly natural response, \u201cwhy me?\u201d or \u201cwhy this?\u201d Ask instead, says O\u2019Donovan, \u201cwhat now?\u201d Walking can help with this. \u201cThe world opens up in a different way when we lift our mood, when we don\u2019t fall into the hole.</p> <p>\u201cYour best chance to stay in contention, as I call it, is to be mindful about what\u2019s going on in the world,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt might seem like it\u2019s very dark at the moment, but there\u2019s lots of good stuff going on too.

  "<p>Just after 7am on the morning of 23 March 2017, journalist <a href=\"https://cpj.org/data/people/miroslava-breach-velducea/\" title=\"\">Miroslava Breach Velducea</a>, a 54-year-old mother of three, was driving her 14-year-old son to school in the city of Chihuahua, Mexico, when a man walked up to her car and shot her eight times. According to reports, her son was not injured, but Breach died on the way to hospital.</p> <p>The Mexican newspaper la Jornada reported that a cardboard note was found at the scene of the murder, which read: \u201cFor being a snitch. You\u2019re next, Governor \u2013 El 80.\u201d According to Mexican police, \u201cEl 80\u201d was Carlos Arturo Quintana, son of the leader of an organised crime syndicate known as La L\u00ednea, which in its heyday controlled one of the lucrative smuggling routes for the supply and transfer of drugs from Colombia to the US. Three days before Breach was murdered, Quintana\u2019s father had been killed in a confrontation between rival gangs.</p> <p>Breach worked for la Jornada and for the regional paper Norte de Ciudad Juarez, covering politics and crime; she had also set up her own news agency, Mir. She had reported extensively on the links between organised crime and politicians in Chihuahua state. On 4 March 2016, Breach wrote in la Jornada about the alleged criminal connections of mayoral candidates in several small towns in western Chihuahua. Breach had received threats to her life on at least three occasions as a result of her reporting. In October 2016, she had told a meeting of the Federal Mechanism for Journalists and Human Rights Defenders that she had been threatened. Nevertheless, on the day she was killed, she had no protection.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fa6f80423c5348af2f2d9f685c8f7b0d7d947b5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa6f80423c5348af2f2d9f685c8f7b0d7d947b5d/0_93_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A protest in Mexico City after the murder of Miroslava Breach in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protest in Mexico City after the murder of Miroslava Breach in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Cardenas/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Breach\u2019s story is not an isolated one. She was one of six journalists killed in Mexico in 2017; more than 150 journalists have been <a href=\"https://www.cndh.org.mx/sites/default/files/documentos/2019-08/COMUNICADO%20324-2019.pdf\" title=\"\">killed</a> there since 2000, 22 of them in the state of Chihuahua. In 2019, according to <a href=\"https://cpj.org/reports/2019/10/getting-away-with-murder-killed-justice.php\" title=\"\">data compiled</a> by the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), Mexico had the seventh-highest number of unsolved murders of journalists in the world, behind Somalia, Syria, Iraq, South Sudan, the Philippines and Afghanistan. On 18 May this year, gunmen killed the owner of a newspaper, Jorge Miguel Armenta \u00c1valos, and one of the policemen assigned to protect him, following earlier threats. Armenta, who is at least the third journalist to be murdered in Mexico in 2020, was attacked in broad daylight while leaving a restaurant.</p> <p>According to the World Press Freedom Index for 2020, compiled by <a href=\"https://rsf.org/en/mexico\" title=\"\">Reporters Without Borders</a> (RSF) and released in March, journalists in Mexico face a dire situation: \u201cCollusion between officials and organized crime poses a grave threat to journalists\u2019 safety and cripples the judicial system at all levels. Journalists who cover sensitive political stories or organized crime are warned, threatened and often gunned down in cold blood.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Attacks on journalists around the world take many forms, some of which are sanctioned in law. Legal or quasi-legal mechanisms include the use of civil or criminal legal actions, covert surveillance, overt censorship and financial threats (such as withdrawing state advertising), as well as more direct intimidation and threats.</p> <p>In recent years, another way of silencing journalists has proliferated: the use of what are known as strategic lawsuits against public participation, or <a href=\"https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/help-record-rise-of-slapp-lawsuits-aiming-to-silence-journalists-comment/\" title=\"\">Slapps</a>, where defamation or criminal lawsuits are brought with the intention of shutting down forms of expression such as peaceful protest or writing blogs. Originally regarded as an American legal mechanism, such lawsuits are now fairly widespread in Europe. Before she was killed in 2017, the Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia was facing around 40 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/19/malta-urged-to-drop-libel-lawsuits-against-daphne-caruana-galizia\" title=\"\">libel lawsuits</a> filed by companies, government officials and individuals, which were described by her son Matthew as a \u201cnever-ending type of torture\u201d.</p> <p>V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1, the vice-president of the European Commission, the executive branch of the EU, has been working on introducing protections against Slapp lawsuits, the defence of which can cost individuals a fortune and tie up their time and resources. Justin Borg-Barthet, a legal academic at Aberdeen University, has called for EU law to be changed to prevent \u201cforum shopping\u201d to countries with claimant-friendly laws, so that defamation suits would have to be filed in the courts of the country where the media organisation or journalist was based. Slapp lawsuits are commonly used against journalists investigating government corruption or exposing corporate abuses, but are also used against civil society organisations, activists such as environmental campaigners, trade unionists and academics, to shut down or silence acts of criticism and protest.</p> <p>In France, media organisations and NGOs <a href=\"https://actionaid.org/stories/2019/slapp-face-accountability\" title=\"\">have been hit</a> with what they view as Slapp suits for publishing accusations of land-grabbing from villagers and farmers in Cameroon by companies associated with the Bollor\u00e9 Group. In the UK, fracking companies including Ineos, UK Oil &amp; Gas, Cuadrilla, IGas and Angus Energy have since 2017 <a href=\"https://www.lag.org.uk/article/205728/fracking-and-the-right-to-protest\" title=\"\">sought and been granted</a> wide-ranging court injunctions, often directed against persons unknown, to prevent protests and campaigning activities at drilling sites. These injunctions had a chilling effect on the right to protest and free speech, until the court of appeal <a href=\"https://drillordrop.com/2019/04/03/breaking-anti-fracking-campaigners-win-appeal-against-ineos-protest-injunction/\" title=\"\">ruled in April 2019</a> that parts of an Ineos injunction prohibiting protests on the public highway and against the Ineos supply chain, and which had been used as a template for similar orders granted to other oil and gas companies, were unlawful.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4079b38e070089a37d3e8539102f970c5c9e899e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4079b38e070089a37d3e8539102f970c5c9e899e/0_232_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maltese investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was murdered by a car bomb in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maltese investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was murdered by a car bomb in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darrin Zammit Lupi/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alongside Slapp suits, there are more traditional ways to keep journalists quiet. More than 150 countries retain some sort of criminal defamation laws, many of which include the possibility of imprisonment. Blasphemy and insult laws remain commonplace in many countries, and are often used by politicians and government officials against any critical media. A number of countries including Turkey and Egypt have expansive definitions of \u201cterrorism\u201d that allow them to arrest and detain anyone who voices political dissent or opposition, including journalists.</p> <p>In countries such as Hungary and Poland, governments and political allies exercise quasi-legal control of public information. Media owners can be pressured on what content to publish by threats to limit access to finance and advertising revenues.</p> <p>Separately, the lack of legal protections for journalists against those who attack them acts as a strong deterrent. Impunity fuels a vicious cycle of violence, bolstering those who aim to silence public debate and block sensitive information.</p> <p>In 2013, the UN published a <a href=\"https://en.unesco.org/un-plan-action-safety-journalists\" title=\"\">plan of action</a> on the safety of journalists, and the problem of impunity for perpetrators. The plan provides a framework for co-operation between UN bodies, national authorities, media actors and NGOs. Spearheaded through Unesco, the plan was incorporated into the Declaration of the Council of Europe in April 2014, and in guidelines published by the EU soon after. In April 2016, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted a recommendation on the protection of journalism and safety of journalists and other media actors.</p> <p>By the end of 2018, the Council of Europe\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.coe.int/en/web/media-freedom/the-platform\" title=\"\">Platform for the Protection of Journalism and Safety of Journalists</a>, set up to record information on serious concerns about media freedom and the safety of journalists in Council of Europe (CoE) member states, had registered more than 500 <a href=\"https://www.coe.int/en/web/media-freedom/all-alerts\" title=\"\">alerts</a>, with year-on-year rises of incidents in every year except 2017. Nearly half of all alerts are marked as category 1, covering the most severe and damaging violations of media freedom, such as murder, direct threats to life and physical assaults. The majority of threats came from the state, with physical attacks and detentions making up nearly half the alerts. Since 2015, only 11% of all alerts have been marked as resolved, a figure that goes down to 1.82% for alerts entered in 2018. Interviews with journalists echo these statistics. In 2017, a study that interviewed 940 journalists from all CoE member states found that a staggering 40% of them had suffered slander.</p> <p>According to a <a href=\"https://rm.coe.int/background-paper-safety-of-journalists-and-other-media-actorsfinal/168094b396\" title=\"\">May 2020 report</a> by Peter Noorlander on the implementation of the 2016 CoE recommendation, attacks against journalists remain insufficiently investigated, and a very high percentage of incidents go unpunished. \u201cJournalists have little confidence that attacks or threats against them will be investigated, and often do not report them,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis has a grave effect on them, and many no longer report attacks but instead self-censor and shy away from potentially controversial issues \u2026 [CoE] Member States have committed to creating an enabling environment for freedom of expression, yet, what journalists experience on the ground is increased violence, threats, denigration, arbitrary arrests and detention.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Some of the most high-profile cases of attacks against the media in the last few years have involved journalists in countries where neither democracy nor the rule of law is respected. Many of the more recent attacks have been perpetrated or encouraged by heads of state.</p> <p>They include cases such as the politically sponsored harassment of Philippines journalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/maria-ressa\" title=\"\">Maria Ressa</a>, the editor of Rappler, a social news network. Under Ressa, the site has revealed the activities of the online \u201ctroll army\u201d that supports the presidency of Rodrigo Duterte and spreads disinformation about his opponents. Rappler has also reported critically on extrajudicial killings, human-rights violations and the rising death rates from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/18/philippines-rodrigo-duterte-war-on-drugs-catholic-church\" title=\"\">Duterte\u2019s war on drugs</a>. The law suits that would follow were presaged during Duterte\u2019s state of the union speech in July 2017, when he declared that Rappler was \u201cfully owned\u201d by the Americans, and therefore in violation of the constitution.</p> <p>In January 2018, the Philippine securities and exchange commission revoked Rappler\u2019s licence. The government then investigated Rappler for tax evasion, and a warrant for Ressa\u2019s arrest was issued in November 2018. In February 2019, Ressa and Rappler were hit with another lawsuit alleging libel relating to a story published in 2012, using a law enacted four months after the story was published.</p> <p>Other infamous cases of state-sponsored crimes against journalists include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/23/jamal-khashoggi-timeline-of-key-events\" title=\"\">the brutal murder</a>, on 2 October 2018, of Saudi dissident and Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. The CIA have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/17/cia-khashoggi-findings-highly-damaging-to-saudi-prince-mohammed-bin-salman\" title=\"\">concluded</a> that the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, ordered the journalist\u2019s assassination. On 19 July 2019, the office of the UNHCR released a report <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=24713\" title=\"\">describing</a> Khashoggi\u2019s death as \u201cpremeditated extra judicial execution\u201d.</p> <p>In many western countries, there is a risk that intimidation and violence against the media is becoming normalised. On Czech election day in October 2017, Czech president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/milos-zeman-czech-leader-refugees\" title=\"\">Milo</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/milos-zeman-czech-leader-refugees\" title=\"\">\u0161 Zeman</a> held up a mock assault rifle with an inscription that was translated as \u201cAt journalists\u201d.

But that would be a mistake. In 2007, Thames Valley police searched the home and office of Sally Murrer, a local journalist. \u201cI was just pottering around doing typical local stories and in May 2007, eight police officers swooped at my home while eight swooped simultaneously at the office,\u201d she <a href=\"https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/local-press-reporter-police-surveillance-destroyed-my-life-the-snoopers-charter-absolutely-terrifies-me/\" title=\"\">told</a> reporters from the Press Gazette. \u201cThey seized all my computer equipment, searched my house, phones, laptops. They took me into custody where I stayed for a couple of days, strip-searched me. I honestly had no idea [why]. They said the charge was aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office and it carried life imprisonment.</p> <p>\u201cIt was only later when they interviewed me, which they did copious times, and played me tapes and showed me transcripts of texts, that I realised I had been under surveillance for the previous eight weeks. It was just a ghastly feeling.\u201d</p> <p>Thames Valley police had secretly recorded a conversation that took place between her and a police officer. Murrer was accused of receiving sensitive stories from the police officer and selling them to the News of the World. \u201cThe stories were about a local GBH committed by a footballer, and the murder of a local man where there was a link to cannabis and his wife was the secretary of the then-MP.\u201d After 19 months, during which she had been on police bail, Murrer\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/nov/28/pressandpublishing-medialaw\" title=\"\">trial collapsed</a> after the judge ruled police had breached her rights.</p> <p>More recently, in August 2018, the police in Northern Ireland arrested two journalists, Trevor Birney and Barry McCaffrey, over the alleged theft of documents from the Northern Ireland police ombudsman into the 1994 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/mar/22/investigating-the-loughinisland-murders\" title=\"\">Loughinisland massacre</a>, when members of a loyalist paramilitary group, the Ulster Volunteer Force, burst into a pub with assault rifles and fired on the customers.

The raid on the home of the News Corporation journalist was in response to a story she had written about how the Australian Signals Directorate was seeking new powers to spy on Australian citizens. In February, a court ruled the search was legitimate as the police were investigating valid national security offences. ABC\u2019s managing director, David Anderson, described the decision as \u201ca blow for public interest journalism\u201d and argued that it highlighted a \u201cserious problem\u201d with Australia\u2019s national security laws.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Since the outbreak of coronavirus, protections for journalists have become <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-52363305\" title=\"\">more urgent than ever.</a> According to RSF\u2019s secretary-general, Christophe Deloire, \u201cThe coronavirus pandemic illustrates the negative factors threatening the right to reliable information, and is itself an exacerbating factor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBoth China and Iran censored their major coronavirus outbreaks extensively.

Testifying under the alias \u201cApolo\u201d, the son of the leader of Los Salazares gave evidence about how his father was upset that a relative lost a mayoral election in the town of Chinipas, el Heraldo newspaper reported. The judge found that Moreno supervised the crime and enlisted the help of two other people, Jaciel Vega Villa, who allegedly drove the car to Breach\u2019s home, and Ram\u00f3n Andr\u00e9s Zavala Corral, who was suspected of having fired the shots that fatally wounded her.

In the weeks that followed, Newsom expanded the modifications to allow counties that had not been as affected by the virus as others to apply for looser restrictions. As of Tuesday, 47 out of the state\u2019s 58 counties have self-attested, and will be allowed to reopen hair salons, offices, some schools, all with modifications. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cThe pace at which the state has made these modifications is concerning to me,\u201d said Dr Sara Cody, health director in Santa Clara county, location of what is believed to be the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/coronavirus-killing-americans-weeks-earlier-than-thought\"> first Covid-related death</a> in the country. </p> \n  <p>Cody voiced these concerns at a local board of supervisors meeting on Tuesday, where she called for the county to take a more cautious approach. Since the start of the stay-at-home order, local variance has taken precedence, meaning if a county health officer called for stricter measures than the state order, then the county would comply with the county order. <br></p> \n  <p>Cody continued: \u201cWe can\u2019t see the effect of any of these changes, the effect on Covid, for at least 14 days, an incubation period, and 21 days is even better,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the state modifications are being made without a real understanding of the consequences of what the last move has been and with the possibly serious effects for health and possibly serious risks of an exponential growth in cases and therefore a risk to social and economic well-being.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>In particular, Cody had reservations about Newsom\u2019s decision to authorize county health officers to allow religious, cultural and political gatherings of 100 people, a move she said \u201cposes a very serious risk of the spread of Covid-19, based on probability alone\u201d.<br></p> \n  <p>Cody\u2019s concerns come as California crossed the threshold on Wednesday of more than 100,000 positive cases \u2013 101,229 to be exact.

Turkey is home to 4 million mostly Syrian refugees. </p> \n  <p>Memories are still fresh of the crisis that erupted when thousands responded to Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s abrupt decision to \u201copen the gates to Europe\u201d for refugees earlier this year. An estimated 30,000 men, women and children - many bussed in by Turkish forces - converged on the frontier with thousands then attempting to illegally cross over into Greece. In recent days bilateral tensions have been on the rise over Athens\u2019 declared intention to build a fence to bolster the border \u2013 reiterated by Chrysohoidis this afternoon. </p> \n  <p>Meanwhile, migrants forced to endure prolonged quarantine in a facility in the Peloponnese also took to the streets in protest today. </p> \n  <p>Greek authorities announced lockdown measures would be extended for another 14 days after three more coronavirus cases were confirmed in the holding centre \u2013 a hotel in the southern town of Kranidi hosting 470 migrants and refugees mostly from sub-Saharan Africa. The hotel has been under quarantine since 21 April when 153 people first tested positive for the virus. </p> \n  <p>Growing disquiet is also being expressed by aid workers over refugee camps having to put up with prolonged lockdowns when the rest of Greece is relaxing restrictions and re-assuming a semblance of normality. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWe have seen a noticeable rise in all sorts of violence, from tent violence to sexual violence because people are forced to spend much more time in camps,\u201d Apostolos Veizis, the medical director of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res in Greece told the Guardian. \u201cThese people are not treated as human but numbers.

The current toll stands at 350,456. The number of confirmed cases is 5,589,932, after the number of declared cases doubled in a month, with more than one million new cases registered in the last 11 days. There were 500,000 cases registered in just 48 hours, between Sunday, when cases passed 5 million, and Tuesday, when cases passed 5.5 million. True death tolls and cases are likely to be significantly higher due to differing definitions and testing rates, delays and suspected underreporting.
