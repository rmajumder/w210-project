There should be a more consultative mechanisms where states sit together. There needs to be cooperation. There should be a blueprint for working together.

All countries in the region are affected and under lockdowns of varying degrees, with international travel suspended and movement increasingly prohibited. <strong>Ivory Coast</strong> has the highest number of confirmed cases at 654. </p> \n  <p>Yet, across west Africa testing is very limited, with <strong>Ghana</strong> testing about 35,000 people so far and Nigeria only about 5,000. In Lagos, authorities have just begun the first community testing to determine the spread in the wider population, as so far tests have only been conducted on people who have recently travelled into the country or who have alerted authorities to their condition. </p> \n  <p><strong>Nigeria</strong>\u2019s government is racing to strengthen a chronically underfunded health system, with only a few hundred ICUs and ventilators for its 200 million people, according to medical unions. Nigeria spends 4% of GDP on health, which is among the lowest levels in percentage terms in Africa. <br><br>Nigeria already has an oxygen crisis, with 625,000 people dying each year due to hospitals not having enough oxygen provision. In recent weeks, strikes by doctors have further highlighted the difficulties in health services, amid complaints of unpaid salaries and poor working conditions.<br><br>The number of laboratories testing for Covid-19 are being quickly expanded and health centres built with help from the private sector. But there remain fears that even a moderate outbreak could overwhelm the system unless much more is done. </p> \n  <p>The financial toll of the lockdowns on the poor in west Africa is already becoming clear, with videos across social media of citizens pleading for food supplies and money. Lockdowns have been widespread but help is incredibly limited. <strong>Ghana</strong> has been among the more proactive countries, yet most are struggling to provide adequate supplies to more than a fraction of the people affected. <br><br>In <strong>Senegal</strong>, there are fears that more than 100,000 street children, known locally as Talib\u00e9s, who beg on the streets are at a greater risk of contracting the coronavirus. Many are homeless or living in squalid, congested Islamic boarding schools. Senegalese authorities say they are trying to help by providing education centres for 1,500 children. <br><br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T10:20:20.160Z\">at 11.20am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e982a158f08cf571cdb2071\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T09:53:31.483Z\">10.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Europe still in the midst of the Covid-19 storm, World Health Organization warns</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/16/coronavirus-live-news-cases-worldwide-top-2-million-trump-doubts-china-death-toll?page=with:block-5e9823398f08ea7431f43ce7#block-5e9823398f08ea7431f43ce7\">More from the World Health Organization press briefing</a>, as the body\u2019s European regional director warns that the continent is still in the midst of the storm of the Covid-19 pandemic, with the number of cases nearing a million.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAs of today, Europe remains very much at the centre of the pandemic.

Maybe. <br></p> \n  <p>The US is now firmly entrenched at the center of the global coronavirus outbreak, with more than 600,000 people confirmed as being infected by Covid-19 and more than 30,000 losing their lives due to the virus.</p> \n  <p>There are hopes that the US is starting to hit a peak in terms of new infections, followed by a long plateau and then drop, which will open the way to a gradual restart of normal life such as the opening of schools and businesses.<br></p> \n  <p>Anthony Fauci, the federal government\u2019s top infectious diseases expert, has expressed \u201ccautious optimism\u201d that hospitalizations from the virus have started to slow down, although the rise in deaths will lag behind. \u201cOnce you turn that corner, hopefully we\u2019ll see a very sharp decline,\u201d Fauci said. On 13 April Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told NBC that \u201cwe are nearing the peak right now.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>A model relied upon by the White House, from the University of Washington, estimates that the virus will \u201cpeter out\u201d in May and then essentially grind to a halt by the summer. This is based on the experiences of China and Italy, previous coronavirus hotspots.<br></p> \n  <p>But this model, like all predictions, is dynamic and depends upon the application of measures such as social distancing to slow the rate of transmission. Other forecasts have been more pessimistic, warning that it will be difficult to tame the spread of the virus until well after summer. Premature relaxation of restrictions on gatherings of people could see a second, much more severe, increase in infections. <br></p> \n  <p>The sheer size of the US, as well as its large population, means that there will be several \u2018peaks\u2019 at different times across the country. While the situation may be starting to stabilize somewhat in New York, areas in the heart of the country have yet to see the worst of the virus.\u201dThat is going to be confusing for people,\u201d said Doug Burgum, governor of North Dakota. \u201cIf wow, New York had all these deaths and they are opening up, why aren\u2019t we opening?

  "<p>Four in 10 of the 165,000 Europeans stranded around the world amid the pandemic are UK nationals but the British government has organised fewer EU-funded emergency flights than any other major country apart from Italy, the Guardian can reveal.</p> <p>The UK has chartered just six flights via the EU crisis scheme, bringing 1,000 Britons home. Germany, in comparison, has organised 101 such flights through the programme, repatriating a total of 21,815 of its citizens with EU cash.</p> <p>About 65,000 UK nationals around the world are still in need of repatriation compared to \u201cseveral thousand\u201d German nationals, according to figures obtained by the Guardian.</p> <p>A Foreign Office spokesman did not deny the accuracy of the data, which was shared by the UK with foreign consulates earlier this week.</p> <p>The shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, said the numbers raised questions over the British government\u2019s repatriation policy. \u201cThe UK\u2019s reliance on commercial airlines has left far too many British citizens stranded abroad, with many concerned about running out of money or medication and increasingly anxious about how they will get home.\u201d</p> <p>She said she had been \u201coverwhelmed with appeals for help from Britons\u201d, some of whom had lost thousands of pounds on cancelled flights. Their plight underlined the need, she said, for an interim foreign secretary to be appointed to enable urgent decisions to be taken about the charter flights.<br><br>\u201cFCO staff are doing their best but there are decisions to be taken, in real time, to support those British citizens who feel they have been abandoned at a time of great need,\u201d she said.</p> <p>On Thursday the German embassy confirmed it had repatriated 60,000 citizens \u2013<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/germany-charters-30-times-more-rescue-flights-for-citizens-than-uk#maincontent\"> up from 42,000 two weeks ago</a> \u2013 on 240 charter flights, compared to \u201cmore than 2,800\u201d British citizens cited by the UK foreign minister James Cleverly on a recent Twitter update.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JamesCleverly/status/1248924029064527874\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Important information for British nationals who are currently abroad \ud83d\udc47 <a href=\"https://t.co/HtGdm701Hr\">pic.twitter.com/HtGdm701Hr</a></p>&mdash; James Cleverly (@JamesCleverly) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JamesCleverly/status/1248924029064527874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 11, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Adrienne Newton, a retried GP, who has been stranded in Argentina for a month, said she has lost faith in the British government after the embassy rang her and said there were 300 people stranded but no plans for charter flights.</p> <p>She said: \u201cThe British government in Argentina is only notable by its absence and it has left us reeling. I don\u2019t feel safe in the government\u2019s hands any more. Last week there were flights organised by France to Paris and Amsterdam, by Spain to Madrid. Iberia has another flight to Madrid tomorrow while Germany has another flight to Frankfurt and Switzerland has one to Zurich on Saturday. And what is our government doing? Nothing, it is embarrassing.\u201d</p> <p>She had now resorted, she said, to begging other embassies for a seat on their flights; they had all responded \u201cpersonally\u201d with emails to say their flights were full.</p> <p>The government has been severely criticised by MPs and constituents for the failure to act like other EU countries towards its own citizens in the face of a pandemic.</p> <p>It was only on 30 March that the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, two weeks after many countries had locked down, announced a \u00a375m effort to repatriate hundreds of thousands of British.</p> <p>Under the EU\u2019s civil protection mechanism established in 2001 participating countries can recuperate, from the EU budget, 75% of the costs of organising emergency flights during times of natural disaster.</p> <p>The six flights organised by the UK under the scheme took place in February and March carrying 1,125 Britons. Four of the flights were from Lima, Peru, and one each was chartered to transport people from the cities of Oakland in California, and Tokyo.</p> <p>The flights also took home 122 EU nationals from Ireland, Germany, Romania, Sweden, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Hungary, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Spain, France, Latvia, Lithuania and Belgium.</p> <p>A further 672 UK nationals have been returned home on flights organised by other countries.</p> <p>Raab has also agreed to a weekly meeting with the foreign minister Nigel Adams, other MPs and Nandy, who have complained about the lack of rescue flights. Sources said the first meeting was \u201cvery useful\u201d.</p> <p>Participants in this civil protection mechanism are the 27 EU member states, the UK and six \u201cparticipating states\u201d, namely Iceland, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, Serbia and Turkey.</p> <p>Explaining the relatively low number of flights organised by the UK, sources said it was a condition of the mechanism that seats should be made available on flights to EU nationals but that this was not always possible given the number of Britons in need of rescue. The mechanism is also supposed to be used as a last resort.</p> <p>These conditions have not stopped Germany flying its nationals back from all around the world, including from Bali, Brisbane, Sydney, Islamabad, Mumbai and Mexico City.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Germany, which had an estimated 250,000 nationals affected by the travel lockdowns, of which about 50,000 were stranded, is by far the biggest user of the EU mechanism, ahead of France (18 flights), the Czech Republic (13), Spain (11) and Belgium (8). A total of 43,584 stranded people have been repatriated with EU funds.</p> <p>The UK has faced an uphill battle getting its citizens back but about 1.3 million Britons have returned home since the outbreak began.</p> <p>A Foreign Office spokesman said: \u201cThe UK has activated the civil protection mechanism on several occasions, as part of our international response to coronavirus, which helped repatriate British nationals and EU citizens.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 The headline of this article was amended on 22 April 2020 to more accurately reflect that the flights which were the main subject of this article were EU-funded.</p>",

  "<p>The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, on Thursday confirmed the extension of the UK\u2019s Covid-19 lockdown measures for a further three weeks. The announcement had been widely trailed, and if Mr Raab had said anything else it would have been a surprise. It was nevertheless a big decision \u2013 the biggest this government has taken in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/12/boris-johnson-leaves-hospital-as-he-continues-recovery-from-coronavirus\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson\u2019s absence</a>. The lockdown will now continue until at least 7 May. On the basis of the country\u2019s behaviour these past three weeks, there is good reason to expect the measures to be observed.</p> <p>The extension puts fresh pressure on the public, the vulnerable, business and the economy. But it is the correct decision. The coronavirus pandemic remains virulent. Thursday brought <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public\" title=\"\">confirmation</a> of 4,618 new positive tests for the virus and of 861 new deaths in hospital in the UK. These figures are worse than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/15/uk-coronavirus-live-government-lockdown-exit-strategy-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e970ccf8f08213494be722b#block-5e970ccf8f08213494be722b\" title=\"\">Wednesday\u2019s</a>. The trend of new cases and deaths is abating by comparison with a week ago, which is cause for some relief. But the numbers are still high. The fight against the pandemic, as Mr Raab said, is at a \u201cdelicate and dangerous\u201d stage. This is not the time to start easing the control measures in ways that could endanger lives and threaten to overwhelm the health and care services.</p> <p>Mr Raab was aware that things are beginning to change in some countries. But he gave few clues away about UK government thinking on future easing. That was no surprise either. Ministers still regard public discussion of any exit strategy as off limits. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/uk-needs-lockdown-exit-strategy-says-key-coronavirus-adviser\" title=\"\">Matt Hancock</a> gave a vigorous defence of that policy in a round of interviews on Thursday, insisting that the government has no intention of deviating from the core message to stay at home and save lives. His junior minister <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NadineDorries/status/1250494730451836928?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet\" title=\"\">Nadine Dorries</a> even said journalists should stop asking about the subject.</p> <p>But the pressure on ministers to start setting out their future options will not go away. Nor should it. Ministerial silence means one of two things. It either means that ministers cannot agree what to do next, especially without a lead from Mr Johnson. Or it means they do not trust the public to behave responsibly. Both are alarming. The first implies that parts of the government may have a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-52304993\" title=\"\">Trumpian</a> recklessness towards public safety. The second implies that ministers underestimate the people. Both of them justify <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/keir-starmer-calls-for-ministers-to-set-out-plans-to-end-coronavirus-lockdown\" title=\"\">Labour</a> attempts to bring the exit strategy issue out into the public realm where it should now belong.</p> <p>There is no contradiction between maintaining lockdown and airing some practical issues to which the country will need to become accustomed when the lockdown is eased. The public can keep two ideas in their heads at the same time. Most people understand that social distancing remains key to suppressing the pandemic until immunity is established and vaccines can be developed. Even more would do so if British ministers possessed the kind of communication skills about the dilemmas that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/angela-merkel-draws-on-science-background-in-covid-19-explainer-lockdown-exit\" title=\"\">Angela Merkel</a> displayed this week. Refusing to discuss the easing of controls may in the end have the opposite effect to what is intended, by creating a pent-up wish to abandon the current disciplines.</p> <p>Mr Raab skated on thin ice over this. But the return of parliament next week will make the government\u2019s position harder to maintain. So will the prudent easing measures that are being introduced in some <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52291326\" title=\"\">European countries</a> this week. It is therefore time to lay the ground for an eventual easing here too. It needs to be done well and rationally, not badly and confusedly, let alone in the Trump manner.</p> <p>We need to start getting used to the idea that parts of the economy, some demographic groups and maybe some regions will begin, perhaps in late May, to be subject to different levels of control. Some businesses, workforces, <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/lockdown-exit-uk-faces-segmenting-older-family-from-young-9zpgqwxsw\" title=\"\">demographic groups</a> and locations will nevertheless remain in lockdown, possibly for months. Continued social distancing, wider public use of protective equipment including masks and gloves, and some system of testing and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/who-urges-countries-to-track-and-trace-every-covid-19-case\" title=\"\">tracing</a> will all need to be considered. Good policing of the easing will be crucial. The new normal will not be like the old, pre-pandemic, normal in many ways. The government may need to call a halt if virus cases spike upwards. But Britain stumbled into the Covid-19 crisis. It does not need to stumble out of it.</p>",

Up to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/million-undocumented-migrants-could-go-hungry-say-charities\">a million</a> undocumented people are thought to be at risk of destitution in the UK alone. </p> <p>Some countries have acted pragmatically to separate health from legal status. Portugal has offered temporary citizenship to those seeking asylum; Spain has loosened its regime of immigration detention; Germany suspended the use of the Dublin regulation \u2013 the law that determines which EU state is responsible for examining an application for asylum; Ireland has said it will respect a firewall for any undocumented people seeking healthcare or social services during the pandemic: they will not be reported to immigration or the police. Forced deportations are also down.</p> <p>But Greece, Belgium, the Netherlands, Cyprus and Slovenia have temporarily suspended access to asylum, and Hungary has cancelled the right to asylum altogether because of \u201crisk related to the spread of Covid-19\u201d. </p> <p>The contagious nature of Covid-19 creates a public health paradox: if migrant workers, undocumented or otherwise, are unable to seek medical help or social assistance when sick, they will continue working, putting the wider community\u2019s health at risk. \u201cYou want people to receive the right healthcare to remain healthy, and keep the whole population healthy,\u201d said University of Birmingham sociologist Jenny Phillimore, who specialises in migration and public health.</p> <p>As the EU attempts to establish a common approach to lockdown exit and the economic consequences of the pandemic, it is now also being urged to advocate for a common approach towards migrants.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no justification for limiting the right to asylum,\u201d Catherine Wollard, director of the European Council on Refugees and Exiles said. Having a large number of people in legally, economically and psychologically precarious situations involving detention or destitution exacerbates public health concerns, she added. </p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 17 April 2020. An earlier version said that the Moldovan government\u2019s insistence on returning migrants buying medical insurance before boarding their flights home had been ruled illegal by the courts. In fact, following an outcry, the Moldovan ombudsman\u2019s office deemed the measure disproportionate and the government said returnees would instead have to take out medical insurance within three days of arriving back in the country.</p>",

But he cautioned: \u201cWe need to do even better than that \u2026 so when we move to a less restricted environment, we can identify outbreaks very quickly and respond to them.\u201d</p> <p>His government has proposed a mobile app that would trace the movements of patients. At least 40% of Australians would need to download the app for it to be effective.</p> <h2>EU chief: \u2018Europe owes Italy an apology\u2019</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news\">Europe</a> owes Italy \u201ca heartfelt apology\u201d for not offering assistance when the country was suffering in the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak, the head of the European Union executive said.</p> <p>Speaking at the European parliament, commission president Ursula von der Leyen said truth was needed to overcome the pandemic, including political honesty. She said: \u201cToo many were not there on time when Italy needed a helping hand at the very beginning. And yes, for that it is right that Europe as a whole offers a heartfelt apology.\u201d</p> <h2>New York State lockdown extended</h2> <p>Governor Andrew Cuomo has extended the New York state shutdown to 15 May. He also announced that starting on Friday, anyone aged two and older would be required to wear face coverings in public if they cannot socially distance.</p> <p>Another 606 people have died from the virus in New York, the lowest figure in 10 days, bringing the total above 12,000 in the state.</p> <h2>IMF: <strong>Asian economies will not grow this year</strong></h2> <p>Economies in Asia will see zero growth this year for the first time in 60 years, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said. It warned that the global economy would face the \u201cworst recession since the Great Depression\u201d and that Asia\u2019s service sector in particular will struggle to rebound.</p> <p>Changyong Rhee, director of the IMF\u2019s Asia and Pacific department, warned that governments would need to take extraordinary actions as a result. Rhee said: \u201cThis is not a time for business as usual. Asian countries need to use all policy instruments in their toolkits.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Singapore reports biggest jump yet in cases</strong></h2> <p>Singapore reported at least 728 new confirmed cases of coronavirus in the previous 24 hours, the biggest jump yet in numbers in the city-state, which had fought hard to keep its outbreak under control.</p> <p>The latest increase in confirmed cases is 63% more than the 447 new cases reported by the health ministry on Wednesday, and brings the total number so far in the city to 4,427.</p> <p>Singapore had been praised by the World Health Organization for rigorous contact tracing, quarantine and surveillance measures, which had previously mitigated the spread of Covid-19. But the disease has begun spreading rapidly within the large migrant worker community that Singapore relies on to staff many of its basic services, highlighting what rights groups say is a weak link in containment efforts.</p> <h2><strong>Japan declares nationwide state of emergency</strong></h2> <p>Japan has expanded its state of emergency to cover the entire country.</p> <p>Shinzo Abe, the country\u2019s prime minister, told a special meeting of medical experts called to discuss the disease: \u201cAreas where a state of emergency should be carried out will be expanded from the seven prefectures to all prefectures.\u201d</p> <p>According to AFP, the declaration allows regional governors to urge people to stay indoors, but with no punitive measures or legal force the measure is weaker than strict lockdowns seen in other parts of the world.</p> <h2><strong>Facebook to warn users who \u2018like\u2019 misinformation</strong></h2> <p>Facebook will begin showing notifications to users who have interacted with posts that contain \u201charmful\u201d coronavirus misinformation, the company announced.</p> <p>The new policy applies only to misinformation that Facebook considers likely to contribute to \u201c<a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/03/combating-covid-19-misinformation/\">imminent physical harm</a>\u201d, such as false claims about \u201ccures\u201d or statements that physical distancing is not effective.

Isolationism \u2013 to pin a label on these various responses to a shared crisis \u2013 is a new kind of art because this is a new kind of crisis. But artists have been isolated before, and what they produced confirms that being separated from society can do wonders for the creative mind.</p> <p>Artists were quarantined for illness as early as the Renaissance, when Italian cities pioneered social distancing measures as they struggled with plague. The Venetian painter Giorgione died on the lagoon city\u2019s quarantine island Lazaretto Nuovo in 1510. According to his biographer Vasari, he chose to isolate alongside his infected lover and caught the fatal illness. On this island of socially excluded dying people, he may have created his most famous masterpiece, <a href=\"https://www.dulwichpicturegallery.org.uk/about/news-blog/2016/june/whatever-happened-to-the-sleeping-venus/\">the Sleeping Venus</a>. As Giorgione and his lover lay sick and isolated, he made this one last painting of her. She\u2019s not just sleeping \u2013 she\u2019s dying or dead. And as she lies there he records his love. (He <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubo\">doesn\u2019t show the buboes</a>, of course.)</p> <p>The illnesses that have usually led to the isolation of great artists, however, are mental rather than physical. Richard Dadd spent most of his adult life in the closed hospitals of Bedlam and Broadmoor after he murdered his father, who he believed was the devil. Dadd\u2019s doctors encouraged his art even though he never recovered. He painted strange, intense portraits of his carers as well as fantastically detailed scenes of fairy life. Freedom was an escape into microscopically precise visions of tiny demonic beings. Thinking about his painting <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/dadd-the-fairy-fellers-master-stroke-t00598\">The Fairy-Feller\u2019s Master-Stroke</a>, I\u2019m starting to worry about Banksy.

He was locked up for a year in the Saint-Paul Asylum at Saint-Remy. While there, he positively thrived as an artist. He fixed his eyes on the asylum garden, its yellow corridors, its lonely patients. It was while looking out of his window in the asylum that he painted his ecstatic vision of cosmic glory The Starry Night. Vincent killed himself three months after leaving the asylum. He might have been better off staying there.</p> <p>Van Gogh helped inspire the 20th-century cult of \u201coutsider art\u201d or art Brut, which sought out and recognised the works made by asylum patients. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/oct/01/artsfeatures1\">Jean Dubuffet</a>, apostle of art brut, promoted the work of <a href=\"https://www.outsiderartfair.com/artists/aloise-corbaz\">Swiss asylum patient Alo\u00efse Corbaz</a>.

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/may/22/agnes-martin-the-artist-mystic-who-disappeared-into-the-desert\">great abstract painter Agnes Martin</a> got so sick of the noise of the New York art world that she fled in 1967 to a life of solitude, living in a series of adobe dwellings she built for herself in the New Mexico desert. Her absorbing networks of ethereal marks in fields of whiteness are monuments to the peace and silence she found in her wilderness retreat. In a way she was imitating earlier women artists who lived in confinement as nuns. The Renaissance artist Plautilla Nelli spent her life in a convent in Siena but won widespread recognition.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1757e55f1e217c6d6fd3927d912aa240452a5234\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1757e55f1e217c6d6fd3927d912aa240452a5234/53_206_1651_990/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vincent van Gogh\u2019s Starry Night.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ecstatic vision ...

It is all about communicating with others, yet the best art is introspective. Even Banksy, whose art is nothing if not social, has been driven to his own kind of introspection: Rats! Rats! I can see rats! Then again, he chooses to be anonymous so perhaps he\u2019s a shy person at heart.</p> <p>There\u2019s something tragicomic about trying to see the bright side of coronavirus. Isolation does, however, seem to be releasing modern art\u2019s inner hermit. Far from the madding crowds of fairs and biennials, artists are rediscovering the solitary springs of creativity.</p>",
  "<p>Flooding events that now occur in America once in a lifetime could become a daily occurrence along the vast majority of the US coastline if sea level rise is not curbed, according to a new study that warns the advancing tides will \u201cradically redefine the coastline of the 21st century\u201d.</p> <p>The research finds major cities such as Honolulu, New Orleans and Miami will become increasingly vulnerable to elevated high tides and stronger storms fueled by the global heating caused by human activity. Beach and cliff erosion will exacerbate this situation.</p> <p>The accelerating pace of sea level rise means that by the end of the century floods currently considered once in a lifetime, or once every 50 years or so, will become a daily high tide occurrence for more than 90% of the coastal locations assessed by researchers from the US government, the University of Illinois at Chicago and the University of Hawaii.</p> <p>Within 30 years from now, these now-rare flooding events will become annual occurrences for more than 70% of the locations along the US coast according to the research <a href=\"https://nature.com/articles/s41598-020-62188-4\">published in Scientific Reports</a>. This scenario threatens huge, multibillion-dollar damages and, potentially, the viability of some coastal communities.</p> <p>\u201cIf future sea-level rise causes once extreme but rare floods to occur frequently then \u2026 this may render some parts of the US coastline uninhabitable,\u201d said Sean Vitousek, a scientist at the US Geological Survey.</p> <p>The disruption caused by frequent flooding will threaten the habitability of much of the US coastline as it is already widely projected to do to many low-lying islands in the Pacific, Vitousek added.</p> <p>The paper uses an analysis of extreme water levels across more than 200 tide gauges along the US coastline, along with models of future sea level rise that depend on the amount of heat-trapping gases countries pump into the atmosphere through power generation, transportation and other activities.</p> <p>While small changes in the level of the sea may seem inconsequential, the researchers found that 5-10cm of sea level rise can double the chances of flooding, with most coastal locations around the US experiencing a doubling of extreme flooding events every decade this century.</p> <p>Global sea levels have increased by <a href=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-sea-level\">a</a><a href=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-sea-level\">bout eight inches on average since 1880</a>, although some places along the US coast have experienced higher rates than this. The seas are expected, on average, to rise by at least another foot by the end of the century even if emissions are constrained. This will be higher in some regions and much will depend on the pace of melting at the two great ice sheets, in Greenland and Antarctica.</p>",
  "<p>This week, some Americans will be receiving the US government\u2019s Covid-19 stimulus checks and deposits. At up to $1,200 per person, it is intended to give some financial relief to those struggling, and to give a much-needed boost to the economy.</p> <p>For many people, this check won\u2019t even begin to cut it. The average US rent is <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1063502/average-monthly-apartment-rent-usa/\">around $1,400 a month</a>. Meanwhile, unemployment in the US has surpassed<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/business/economy/unemployment-claim-numbers-coronavirus.html\"> 20 million.</a></p> <p>But for others who are still in secure employment and are being paid fully, this creates a dilemma: what to do with the check? Should you donate to people who are worse off; try to support a faltering economy; or save it for a rainy day? We can\u2019t answer that question for you, but here are some good places to start.</p> <h2>Spend it (if you can)</h2> <p>There will be many people for whom spending this check is just not an option. But for those who can, remember that part of the logic behind a stimulus check is to keep people spending, to refuel the economy.

  "<p>Destitute migrants in the UK are continuing to sleep on the streets despite a promise from Boris Johnson that all of them would be given shelter during the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>Last month Johnson <a href=\"https://twitter.com/scotrefcouncil/status/1242820979535097857\">pledged</a> to provide all necessary accommodation and support for destitute migrants, including those with no recourse to public funds.</p> <p>But a range of organisations including <a href=\"https://www.crisis.org.uk/\">Crisis</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pilc.org.uk/\">Public Interest Law Centre</a>, <a href=\"https://migrantsrights.org.uk/\">Migrants Rights Network</a> and Project 17 have said this promise has not been kept.</p> <p>They say many destitute migrants continue to sleep on the streets either because councils have turned them away when they try to access emergency support or because, in the absence of clear government guidance, they do not know how to go about getting this support.</p> <p>Migrant rough sleepers are often more hidden than other rough sleepers because of their fears of being picked up by immigration enforcement teams.</p> <p>The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government told the Guardian that more than 90% of rough sleepers \u201cknown to local authorities\u201d at the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis had been made offers of accommodation, although officials did not say how many were in accommodation. Many migrant rough sleepers are not known to local authorities.</p> <p>Migrant rough sleepers interviewed by the Guardian say they have been turned away when they tried to access the promised support and have had to remain on the streets.</p> <p>One 58-year-old refused asylum seeker from Nigeria, who has been trying to lodge a fresh asylum claim with the Home Office for the past 16 months, has been sleeping on the streets for several years. He said he often slept around London\u2019s Barbican Centre.</p> <p>\u201cI am struggling to get food because many charities I usually go to to get food are closed. I am surviving thanks to some of the people who live in the Barbican who are giving me food,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He added that after Johnson\u2019s announcement last month he approached a London council\u2019s homeless unit and asked for emergency housing. \u201cThey turned me away and said I wasn\u2019t eligible,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t explain to me why they couldn\u2019t support me.\u201d</p> <p>Public Interest Law Centre, Project 17 and Migrants Rights Network wrote to local authorities this week warning that migrant rough sleepers were still not receiving assistance.</p> <p>\u201cThe ongoing failure to provide appropriate support to all those who need it regardless of immigration status is not only a moral failure \u2026 it also poses a serious public health risk leaving migrants unable to socially distance and, where needed, self-isolate,\u201d the letter said.</p> <p>A migrant who has been granted leave to remain but is unable to work during the pandemic said he had contacted the jobcentre to try to get support but had got nowhere.</p> <p>\u201cI am forced to sleep outside at the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cMy friend is letting me go to his house just to take showers. I\u2019m very frightened of catching Covid while I\u2019m sleeping outside. I sleep outside in a mask and gloves.\u201d</p> <p>Matthew Downie, Crisis\u2019s director of policy and external affairs, said: \u201cThe government made a commitment to house everyone sleeping rough, regardless of their immigration status, and put the onus on local authorities to make this happen. There has, however, been a lack of guidance on how this should be done. We know that there are people whose lives are still in danger, sleeping on our streets or trapped in crowded hostels and night shelters.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for the housing ministry said: \u201cOver 90% of rough sleepers known to local authorities at the beginning of this crisis have now been made offers of safe accommodation, ensuring some of the most vulnerable in society are protected from the pandemic.\u201d</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cIn these unsettling times, we will ensure the most vulnerable in our society receive the protection and funding they need and deserve. Even if an asylum claim is failed, we will provide accommodation for those who would otherwise be destitute and who are temporarily unable to leave the UK because of the ongoing travel restrictions.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s strange watching a narrative shift in real time. But then, everything is strange these days. Attitudes that would ordinarily take years, even decades, to shift seem in a state of emergency to transform overnight. Mere weeks ago, migrant care workers were included in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/11/low-skilled-migrants-government-cracking-down\">\u201clow-skilled\u201d category of worker</a> by the Home Office, and barred from entering the UK under new, post-Brexit immigration rules. Now, everyone from the Queen and Matt Hancock to your clapping neighbours is lauding them as key workers. They even get a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/15/hannocks-shiny-badge-emblem-of-a-scamper-into-tigger-mode\">special badge</a>, which reads more like an imperative: \u201cCARE\u201d.</p> <p>I\u2019ve wanted the Conservative party to care for a long time. For most of my adult life, I\u2019ve watched it decimate public services. My husband works in the social care sector, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/11/voting-labour-boris-johnson-disabled-people-health-social-care\">my brother</a>, who is severely autistic, is in the full-time care of the state. I am not alone in this: so many of us love someone who is reliant on the people working in our social care system or works in the system. We have long lamented the low pay and even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/16/social-care-an-afterthought-in-uk-coronavirus-response-says-leaked-letter\">lower respect</a> afforded to care workers but until the coronavirus pandemic, few people listened.</p> <p>The work of caring is long and arduous and often unglamorous. Care workers help my brother brush his teeth. They give him his bath, give him a shave, support him while he dresses, prepare his breakfast, help him use the toilet: all these vital things that he cannot do alone. But this is not all they do. Care work often involves highly specialised tasks, from hoisting and coping with seizures to the administration of medication.</p> <p>Furthermore, the emotional dimension of care work is often lost on people, but this is the most important part of the labour of caring. The work requires kindness, tact, tolerance, generosity, compassion and intelligence. Care workers afford my brother a dignity that the outside world often does not. They treat him as a human being, with interests and needs and desires, even if it means having to listen to Michael Bubl\u00e9 again in the car.</p> <p>They comfort him when he cries because he misses us. They look after him when he has had a seizure and make him feel safe. They make playlists of his favourite music, draw up menu plans, come up with new activities to keep him occupied. They try to calm him down when he is angry or frustrated. Care workers are also often expected to tolerate aggression and abuse as a result of service users\u2019 behavioural problems or mental health issues. They are forced to be the recipients of racist views unleashed, for example, by dementia. Injuries happen.</p> <p>It is difficult to put into words the gratitude I feel towards the people who do this job. Through this crisis, they are there. They are putting sleeping bags in the boots of their cars, in case they need to plug staff shortages. They are sleeping in caravans in the grounds of care homes, on air mattresses. In some homes, they are moving in en masse. As they face a rising death toll, they are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/how-care-homes-are-helping-loved-ones-say-goodbye-coronavirus\">helping people say goodbye</a> to their loved ones. They fill their residents\u2019 rooms with mementos and photographs. They hold their hands when there is no one else to do so. Their commitment to vulnerable people goes above and beyond. It always has done, but now the country as a whole is realising it.</p> <p>Gratitude is welcome. As Matt Hancock, the health and social care secretary, pointed out, we are clapping for our carers, which includes care workers as well as NHS staff. A badge that allows care workers to access essential services will be welcome, especially as some have been turned away from supermarkets. But, as others have so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-social-care-crisis-andy-burnham-nhs\">starkly highlighted</a>, we must not forget that this crisis has been preceded by chronic underfunding. For 10 years, I have watched Conservative-led governments run down the services on which my family and millions of others are reliant. In the middle of all this, care workers have valiantly carried on, but there is a reason that there are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/07/nhs-nurses-social-care\">122,000 social care vacancies</a>. To add to years of neglect, now some care workers have been forced to wear bin bags in the absence of proper protective equipment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/15/britain-coronavirus-crisis-inequality-hungry-domestic-violence\">Britain has a hidden coronavirus crisis \u2013 and it's shaped by inequality | Frances Ryan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The last time I visited a pub, shortly before lockdown, I spent much of the evening talking to a care worker, a friend of a friend.

People don\u2019t realise the toll it takes, she said; people don\u2019t realise how much we give of ourselves.</p> <p>I can\u2019t visit my brother at the moment, but I know that he is in good hands. I am scared, as we all are, and sad that I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll next be able to give him a hug. The men and women who look after him \u2013 many of them young \u2013 are putting their own health at risk to make sure he stays happy and well. Care workers are owed much more than a badge and our applause. They are owed decent pay and benefits, proper working conditions and employment rights. That is gratitude. That is caring.</p> <p>\u2022 Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>The fear of infection has always been intimately related to the fear of foreigners. \u201cKEEP OUT THE GERMS\u201d, the Daily Mail declared in a front page editorial on 3 January 1962, as panic about a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-18365385\">smallpox outbreak</a> spread across Britain. By \u201cgerms,\u201d the Daily Mail really meant foreigners: the editorial singled out Pakistani migrants who arrived from the \u201cendemic home of the disease\u201d, where there was then a smallpox epidemic, and \u201cwalked in [to Britain] without any trouble and were at once a peril to the population\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/coronavirus-us-asian-americans-racism\">'Coughing while Asian': living in fear as racism feeds off coronavirus panic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That spring, the Conservative government passed the 1962 Commonwealth Immigrants Act, finally ending free movement within the Commonwealth and remaining colonies. The health scare surrounding \u201cimported\u201d smallpox \u2013 Britain believed that it had long left this disease behind \u2013 coincided with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/11/it-isnt-just-racism-that-should-bar-enoch-powell-from-a-blue-plaque\">Enoch Powell\u2019s stint as </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/11/it-isnt-just-racism-that-should-bar-enoch-powell-from-a-blue-plaque\">minister of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/11/it-isnt-just-racism-that-should-bar-enoch-powell-from-a-blue-plaque\">health</a>, and helped to nullify parliamentary opposition to the new legislation. As one Labour MP complained, the Conservative government had made border controls \u201ca matter of life and death\u201d, as if immigrants put the health of the nation at stake. If colonial subjects couldn\u2019t be ruled, it seemed, they were neither safe nor welcome.</p> <p>Today, the coronavirus pandemic poses a far more serious threat to national health than the smallpox epidemic, which led to fewer than 100 cases in Britain. Debate rages as to what our post-pandemic world will look like. Socialists, nationalists, internationalists, liberals \u2013 all see reason to believe, or hope, that the future belongs to them. For now, however, it\u2019s hard not to think we\u2019re living in a dystopian version of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/23/labour-nationalism-working-class-support\">Blue Labour\u2019s Britain</a>: left on the economy, right on culture, a stronger state, tighter borders \u2013 we\u2019re all (locked) in this together.</p> <p>In many ways, the pandemic fits most neatly into nationalist narratives: there are few more powerful or reactionary forces in politics than fear, and this is surely the pandemic\u2019s most viral emotion. The outbreak of xenophobia accompanying the fear of infection has been well documented since coronavirus emerged. The disease was first portrayed as a distinctly \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/trump-calls-covid-19-the-chinese-virus-as-rift-with-coronavirus-beijing-escalates\">Chinese virus</a>\u201d, originating in Wuhan, and people perceived as Asian were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/coronavirus-us-asian-americans-racism\">subjected to racist attacks</a> around the world. Yet there seems less acknowledgment that this divisive, hostile symptom of the outbreak will likely outlive the disease. In China, for example, where cases of infection have sharply declined, black people are being subjected to random testing and evicted from their homes over anxieties about \u201cimported coronavirus\u201d. Everywhere you look, as Susan Sontag observed in <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12216695-000-the-fatal-power-of-language-review-of-aids-and-its-metaphors-by-susan-sontag/\">Aids and Its Metaphors</a>, there is the same need \u201cto make a dreaded disease foreign\u201d.</p> <p>The link between \u201cgermophobia\u201d and xenophobia is a recurring theme in politics. The left has not been immune from this trope. In 1958, for example, when tuberculosis was the disease-du-jour, the Trades Union Council warned the Ministry of Labour against Indian and Pakistani immigration, drawing on classic xenophobic anxieties. Key among their concerns were \u201cthe poor health of these immigrants and the belief that many of them are carriers of contagious and infectious diseases\u201d.</p> <p>But a wealth of research suggests that not only is the fear of infection more pronounced on the right, but also \u2013 more worryingly \u2013 that political attitudes become more conservative and reactionary as fears of infection rise. Indeed, one of the primary causes of \u201cgermophobia\u201d is living in cultures that stress hygienic practices (for good reason, that accounts for much of the world right now). A <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21421934\">2011 study</a> conducted at Cornell University suggested that even standing people next to a hand sanitiser dispenser or asking them to wash their hands is enough to make them identify as more conservative. In another <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886912001055\">2012 study</a>, researchers from Hong Kong found that people who were shown scenes from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/apr/04/my-guilty-pleasure-outbreak\">Outbreak</a><em> </em>\u2013 a 1995 film set in the midst of an epidemic \u2013 became more conformist in their views, wanting to align themselves with a perceived majority. It\u2019s easy to see how, on a societal scale, this could feed into more xenophobia.</p> <p>At times, such studies about politics and germs stray into the dubious terrain of evolutionary psychology. Rather than acknowledging the political prejudices that could lead one to be hostile towards perceived \u201coutsiders\u201d, a fear of strangers is said to spring \u201cnaturally\u201d \u2013 apolitically, a-culturally \u2013 from the human aversion to infection. But as the anthropologist Mary Douglas showed in her 1966 book <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/coronavirus/2020/03/coronavirus-disease-dirt-racist-language-immigration\">Purity and Danger</a>,<em> </em>defining what counts as \u201cdirty\u201d (not to mention who counts as a \u201cstranger\u201d) is a cultural act: it is at least as much about identity formation \u2013 defining \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d \u2013 as it is about hygiene.</p> <p>The grim frequency with which dirt and disease are associated with \u201cdangerous\u201d outsiders speaks to the emotional force of this narrative. From portraying minorities as \u201cvermin\u201d to casting concerns about immigration as concerns about public health, the political expedience of this conflation has been affirmed again and again. According to a recently <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3560326\">published working paper</a>, the Republican party\u2019s weaponisation of the Ebola crisis in 2014 \u2013 stoking paranoia and blaming immigration \u2013 played an important role in their resounding victory in that year\u2019s midterm elections.</p> <p>None of this bodes well for our situation, where the fear of infection is already being mobilised to reactionary ends in countries such as Hungary, India, Israel and Algeria. \u201cWe are fighting a two-front war,\u201d Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n declared last month, shortly before imposing coronavirus laws that amount to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/01/viktor-orban-pandemic-power-grab-hungary\">de facto dictatorship</a>. \u201cOne front is called migration and the other one belongs to the coronavirus. There is a logical connection between the two as both spread with movement.\u201d</p> <p>In the US, Donald Trump \u2013 a self-described \u201c<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/germaphobe-trump-hates-people-coughing-and-sneezing-in-his-presence-2019-7?r=US&amp;IR=T\">germophobe</a>\u201d \u2013 plays the same blame game. Even as he downplays the crisis, his popularity in the polls remains strong. To almost every critic of his slow response, he points to how quickly he introduced a travel ban against China, and insists on calling the disease the \u201cChinese virus\u201d \u2013 ignoring that the US is on course to be the worst-affected industrialised country in the world.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s been here before. On the campaign trail in 2015, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/06/donald-trump-mexican-immigrants-tremendous-infectious-disease\">he warned </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/06/donald-trump-mexican-immigrants-tremendous-infectious-disease\">of</a> \u201ctremendous infectious disease \u2026 pouring across the border\u201d. Now, Trump says simply, \u201cwe need a wall more than ever\u201d \u2013 he was right all along. The belief that barbed wire, if we can only build it high enough, will \u201ckeep out the germs\u201d is an attractive placebo for reactionary fears. And it will take more than the pandemic finally passing for this illusion, and all its toxic consequences, to lift. </p> <p>\u2022 Samuel Earle is a writer based in London</p>",
  "<p>White asparagus is late April\u2019s delicacy across much of north-west Europe. In Germany the pale spears of the <em>Spargel</em> are cherished as \u201cwhite gold\u201d, their arrival each year marked by festivals and celebrations. But Germany alone needs <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/germany-eases-border-rules-to-allow-in-harvest-workers-amid-coronavirus-crisis/a-53000322\">300,000 seasonal workers</a> to harvest its crops.

People have been forced to accept a 10pm curfew. </p> <p>And it seems to have worked to protect the Romanian health system from a tsunami of cases. Despite big numbers of Romanian migrant workers returning from Spain and Italy at the height of the pandemic in southern Europe, the rate of Covid-19 infection and death in Romania has remained broadly under control.</p> <p>Until, that is, the imperatives of the asparagus supply chain kicked in. Pressed by German agriculture lobbies, the Berlin government asked the Romanian government to grant a bespoke exemption from the lockdown and <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/2020/04/10/germany-flies-in-seasonal-workers-with-strict-coronavirus-precautions\">clear an airbridge for farm workers</a>.</p> <p>The Romanian government agreed, admitting that it had no income support system for this group of workers, who are usually invisible to the media unless as an object of class-driven scorn. So the asparagus imperative trumped the pandemic, even though Germany had earlier banned foreign workers and the Romanian lockdown was about to be prolonged for a further month.</p> <p>What followed was an epic stampede of thousands of workers to board low-cost flights specially chartered for the massive airbridge. Many had received their contracts on social media apps, others were raked in by able intermediaries, but all ended up crammed into the same nighttime bus rides to the airport. The <a href=\"https://www.romania-insider.com/coronavirus-romanian-seasonal-workers-fly-germany\">ensuing images</a> were shocking: a country in strict quarantine watched thousands streaming out of crammed busses into a small regional airport to board the planes. Given that many workers came from Suceava, Romania\u2019s Covid-19 hotspot, we can only hope this will not turn out to have been one of Europe\u2019s super-spreader events.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"61af86de3a68d2824feee478ee54af7626410235\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61af86de3a68d2824feee478ee54af7626410235/0_0_4001_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Romanian seasonal workers at Avram Iancu international airport, in Cluj, central Romania\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Romanian seasonal workers at Avram Iancu international airport in Cluj, central Romania.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Raul Stef/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This German arrangement, a deal between German employers and the federal government to cover the asparagus season, has inspired food growers in the UK and Italy where the spring and early summer fruit and vegetable harvests are on the brink of collapse for lack of labourers. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/romanian-fruit-pickers-flown-uk-crisis-farming-sector-coronavirus\">Special charter flights from Bucharest to the UK</a> are this week taking hundreds of workers to British farms after a recruitment drive closer to home fell flat.</p> <p>Many farm owners seem happier in any case to have rapid access to the \u201ceasterners\u201d.

But when the Romanian workers take the virus back home with them or when their backs break, the German health service won\u2019t have to look after them.

Europe\u2019s political economy has created the post-communist universal soldier, capable of converting from farm labourer to caregiver to construction worker as the the season changes. Freedom of movement has morphed into migration for survival and even that privilege is reserved for the physically fit.</p> <p>At the end of the day the huddled masses from the planes heading to the fields of Germany or Italy can rely on neither their own country nor the European Union. This begs tough questions about what east Europeans have a right to expect after years of EU membership: is this it?</p> <p>Why can we not demand a different Europe and renegotiate the social contract with it? Why is it so hard to guarantee the safety and the dignity of cross-border workers rather than reducing them to a dehumanised \u201clabour supply\u201d accessible with an app? Why does even the western left withdraw into fantasies about protected labour regimes while millions of east European workers toil under their noses? Why is the movement of millions of people in and out of quarantines, doing essential but undervalued work, not a European issue?</p> <p>EU enlargement to the east gave millions of workers an opportunity to survive.

Since the outbreak of the pandemic, there have been strong moves in the Indian media and sections of the ruling dispensation to pin blame for the spread of the virus on Muslim communities. Yogi Adityanath, a fundamentalist Hindu cleric turned politician with a good line in inflammatory speech, is the chief minister of India\u2019s largest state, Uttar Pradesh, where tensions have been rising. Although the Wire misattributed a quote to him on its website, the erratum was quickly corrected and acknowledged.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Varadarajan now stands accused of a fantastical range of crimes, including disobeying an order of a public servant and creating or promoting enmity between classes. The real problem may be that the Wire <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/up-chief-minister-adityanath-shifts-ram-idol-amid-lockdown/article31160225.ece\">reported correctly</a> that Adityanath had attended a Hindu religious gathering after the national lockdown was declared on 24 March. This report came even as public feelings have been whipped up against Muslims because Tablighi Jamaat, a Muslim organisation, held an event prior to the lockdown where many attendees did get infected. The Wire has also noted that \u201cbelievers\u201d in more than one religious community have been late in adopting precautions against large gatherings.</p> <p>For a long time now, India has benefited from the title of world\u2019s largest democracy (meaning, in fact, the most populous democratic state). That grand moniker continues to lull the world into believing constitutional rights and freedoms thrive in that nation, when they are in fact under grave threat. Although the misuse of state powers to intimidate principled journalists and of religious divides to garner votes has occurred under other governments, including those of the current Congress opposition, there is little doubt that the last six years of Modi\u2019s government have seen an alarming crackdown on campus dissidents as well as journalists and writers.</p> <p><a href=\"https://cpj.org/data/killed/asia/india/?status=Killed&amp;motiveConfirmed%5B%5D=Confirmed&amp;type%5B%5D=Journalist&amp;cc_fips%5B%5D=IN&amp;start_year=1992&amp;end_year=2020&amp;group_by=location\">Fourteen journalists</a> have been killed in India since Modi\u2019s election in 2014.

So many vulnerable populations rely on WHO \u2013 deliberately undermining funding and trust now is shocking.\u201d Heiko Maas, the German foreign minister was slightly more restrained, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HeikoMaas/status/1250322386907357185\">tweeting</a> that: \u201cBlaming does not help.

In the UK, however, where ministers are still hoping for a post-Brexit trade deal, a Downing Street spokesman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/15/coronavirus-us-live-trump-decision-cut-who-funding-sparks-outrage-latest-news-updates?page=with:block-5e9702b88f08213494be7188#block-5e9702b88f08213494be7188\">rejected an invitation</a> to join the condemnation, although they did voice support for the WHO.</p> <p>Why undermine the organisation that is at the forefront of responding to a pandemic? For Trump, this seems particularly illogical \u2013 the pandemic has already killed <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa/u-s-coronavirus-death-toll-tops-30000-new-yorkers-told-to-wear-masks-idUKKCN21X25I\">more than 30,000 Americans</a>. The answer is<strong> </strong>simple. In the midst of an election year, with his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/10/trump-poll-numbers-dip-handling-coronavirus\">approval ratings</a> falling, Trump needs to find someone else to blame. Now that the daily White House briefings have taken on the role of campaign rallies in locked down America, nothing can be allowed to undermine the narrative that he is the saviour of the American people. Failings are the fault of others. Once it was the Mexicans <strong>(</strong>ironically, Mexico is now <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-52053656\">restricting Americans from entering</a> the country<strong>)</strong>. Then it was China, whose political leaders Trump considers insufficiently obsequious. Now, he has redirected his ire at the WHO.</p> <p>It hardly needs to be said that Trump has justified his decision with claims that fail to withstand the most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-trump-halts-funding-to-world-health-organization\">basic scrutiny</a>. He claims that the WHO was \u201cseverely mismanaging and covering up\u201d the early stages of the pandemic, thereby delaying the response by the United States. Yet the WHO had warned of person-to-person transmission as early as 23 January. Six days later, his economic adviser <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/donald-trump-coronavirus-memos-warning-peter-navarro\">warned</a> of the possibility of hundreds of thousands of American deaths. Trump ignored them both.</p> <p>The decision will clearly damage the WHO. First, there is the loss of funding. As the world\u2019s richest country, the United States contributes 40% of the WHO\u2019s core budget, although this only amounts to 20% of its total spending. The US also contributes the largest share to the remaining 80% of voluntary contributions.</p> <p>The US theoretically contributes roughly<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/world-health-organization-why-has-trump-suspended-funding\"> 10-15% of the WHO\u2019s budget</a> as its largest contributor. It\u2019s uncertain whether Trump can legally block payments to the WHO\u2019s core budget, as these are authorised by Congress<strong>,</strong> but he could stop those voluntary payments made by federal agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control.</p> <p>With a total contribution of a <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/trump-is-desperate-to-find-someone-to-blame-for-his-coronavirus-failings\">little under $900m</a>, roughly what the NHS spends in 36 hours, other countries could step up to the mark to replace at least some of this shortfall. However, the decision will likely have a disproportionate effect on areas where the United States has made substantial earmarked contributions, such as polio eradication. More importantly, this is a massive distraction for an organisation working flat out to tackle one of the most serious threats to the health of everyone, including Americans, in decades.</p> <p>The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed the weaknesses of individual leaders and international cooperation.

Sadly, this is a toe-curlingly coy piece of Blitz-kitsch nostalgia, with Dench as the supercilious grande dame Mrs Henderson who buys the Windmill theatre in London\u2019s Soho and turns it into a saucy nude revue that stays open, despite the Luftwaffe\u2019s bombs.</p> <h2>23. Cheri (2009)</h2> <p>A desperately creaky, stuffy, airless period piece, based on the Colette novels. Michelle Pfeiffer plays the elegant courtesan in <em>belle epoque</em> France who is tasked with giving a sentimental education to a boy she calls <em>Ch\u00e9ri</em>, played by Rupert Friend. The cast look like tailor\u2019s dummies in period garb being wheeled around on castors. A pound-shop Les Liaisons Dangereuses.</p> <h2>22. Muhammad Ali\u2019s Greatest Fight (2013)</h2> <p>The \u201cgreatest fight\u201d is Ali\u2019s legal fight in the mid-60s when he was stripped of his world boxing title for refusing to fight in Vietnam, and his appeal reached the supreme court. But this film, obtusely, doesn\u2019t dramatise Ali himself, concentrating on the elderly judges, the cue for much twinkle-eyed character acting from Frank Langella and Christopher Plummer. It doesn\u2019t land much of a punch.</p> <h2>21. Victoria &amp; Abdul (2017)</h2> <p>In which Dench reprises her impersonation of Queen Victoria. The first time around, she was crushing hard on her ghillie, John Brown, played by Billy Connolly, and now it is her Muslim Indian servant Abdul Karim, played by Ali Fazal, in this based-on-a-true-story film. However, it\u2019s a very coy and bland piece of inoffensive heritage cinema.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"03fd0ab8263f0f6e5406a345441a979eb99c80a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03fd0ab8263f0f6e5406a345441a979eb99c80a2/0_224_2981_1789/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Judi Dench and Ali Fazal in Victoria and Abdul (2017)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Judi Dench and Ali Fazal in Victoria and Abdul (2017).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/BBC Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>20. Lay the Favourite (2012)</h2> <p>This is a broad caper about gambling, the excitement of which is difficult to convey properly to uninitiated audiences. It is based on the avowedly true-life memoir of a woman who came to Vegas looking to be nothing more than a cocktail waitress and wound up deeply involved with the scary/thrilling high-rollers. Rebecca Hall is our heroine and Bruce Willis her grouchy boss. A bit moderate.</p> <h2>19. Sammy and Rosie Get Laid (1987)</h2> <p>This multicultural London movie that Frears made in the Thatcher era was interesting, but didn\u2019t quite come off. The Sammy and Rosie of the title are Ayub Khan Din and Frances Barber, who have a bohemian existence in the capital; then Sammy\u2019s father (Shashi Kapoor) comes from Pakistan, disrupting their precarious happiness.</p> <h2>18. Accidental Hero (1992)</h2> <p>This was a big role for Dustin Hoffman and an interesting and lively high-concept story \u2013 but the chemistry didn\u2019t quite work for the film to do as well as it might have done. He plays an oddball hustler midway between his characters in Rain Man and Midnight Cowboy. When a plane crashes on a highway, he drives up to the wreck and saves people\u2019s lives but then has to leave \u2013 and finds that someone else is taking the credit for his heroism. Not a bad tale.</p> <h2>17. Mary Reilly (1996)</h2> <p>Julia Roberts\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/video-news/article31073373.ece\">weird attempt at an Irish accent </a>probably sank this movie, but it has got a lot to recommend it. It\u2019s a retelling of the Jekyll and Hyde story from the point of view of the maid (Roberts), who has no idea that her master, Dr Jekyll, and his sinister friend, Mr Hyde, are the same person \u2013 both played by John Malkovich. Atmospheric and interesting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"05e1ad918384ead7f64d35ab7c3b80b18ff4887c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05e1ad918384ead7f64d35ab7c3b80b18ff4887c/0_0_2405_1443/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Malkovich and Julia Roberts in Mary Reilly\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Malkovich and Julia Roberts in Mary Reilly, a retelling of the Jekyll and Hyde story.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Tristar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>16. The Hit (1984)</h2> <p>An entertaining selection of well-directed performances keep this film going. Terence Stamp is the supergrass ex-criminal exiled in Spain who finds that old comrades have caught up with him, intent on settling scores. Played by John Hurt and a livewire young Tim Roth, they are disconcerted by Stamp\u2019s Zen acceptance of the situation.</p> <h2>15. Liam (2000)</h2> <p>With a brutally tough screenplay from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/may/06/jimmy-mcgovern-broken-liverpool-sean-bean-catholic-priest\">Jimmy McGovern</a>, Frears strays here into what could be called Terence Davies territory. It\u2019s an account of a 1930s Catholic boyhood in Liverpool, in which Ian Hart plays Liam\u2019s dad, an embittered, unemployed docker with a taste for the booze who becomes a Mosleyite blackshirt, to his family\u2019s dismay. A tough watch, and atypically bleak for Frears.</p> <h2>14. The Program (2015)</h2> <p>The strange case of Lance Armstrong is what Frears addresses in this serviceable biopic written by John Hodge. Ben Foster plays the fiercely committed, impregnably arrogant Armstrong, the Tour de France cyclist who first became an inspirational figure for surviving cancer, only to become notorious for doping and then a long battle with his own awful PR. Foster is very good at conveying Armstrong\u2019s beady-eyed fanaticism and inability to reconcile his \u201cunderdog hero\u201d view of himself with the public\u2019s deep disappointment.</p> <h2>13. The Van (1996)</h2> <p>This is just the type of film that responds well to Frears\u2019 gift for getting strong, clear, funny performances across the board, and building the storytelling around them. Colm Meaney plays a shiftless guy in late-80s Ireland who is reasonably happy on welfare but has a Damascene conversion to entrepreneurialism. When his best mate Bimbo discovers an abandoned catering van, the pair have a plan to clean it up (sort of) and sell burgers and chips outside sports grounds. But their big dreams of fast-food wealth go horribly wrong.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"43ca0d71f440e9ee250436121af72df39bb8d283\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43ca0d71f440e9ee250436121af72df39bb8d283/0_94_3032_1819/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Colm Meaney, Donal O\u2019Kelly and Brendan O\u2019Carroll in The Van\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colm Meaney, Donal O\u2019Kelly and Brendan O\u2019Carroll in The Van.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>12. The Hi-Lo Country (1998)</h2> <p>This is one of Frears\u2019 most underrated movies \u2013 a western, to which he brings a cool, understated intelligence and revisionist flair, working from a script by Walon Green, who also wrote The Wild Bunch. Patricia Arquette plays a lonely woman in postwar New Mexico who is drawn to a number of men who aren\u2019t her husband: Billy Crudup\u2019s young rancher and Woody Harrelson\u2019s outrageously brash cowboy. The booming-voiced Sam Elliott plays a wealthy local man who tries to help and advise the hopelessly naive Crudup. A film with real texture and force.</p> <h2>11. Tamara Drewe (2010)</h2> <p>Another underrated movie from Frears, this satire canters enjoyably through the world of English middle-class hypocrisy and vanity. Frears makes this kind of comedy look easy, which is perhaps why it doesn\u2019t get its due. Screenwriter Moira Buffini adapts Posy Simmonds\u2019 graphic novel about a young woman (Gemma Arterton) who returns to her sleepy home village with a nose job and a glamorous position in the media, and promptly shakes everything up. There are great performances in particular from Roger Allam and Tamsin Greig.</p> <h2>10. Gumshoe (1971)</h2> <p>This debut feature is an early gem in the Frears canon, with a great ensemble supporting cast including Frank Finlay and Billie Whitelaw, and a taut script from Neville Smith. Albert Finney stars as Eddie, an ordinary guy in Liverpool who is a bingo-caller and cheesy nightclub comic turn, with an unsightly line in the ugly racist banter of that era. But he also exists in a Walter Mitty fantasy world of private detectives, idolising the screen persona of Humphrey Bogart. When Eddie actually tries to live the private detective dream, by placing an ad for his dubious services in the local paper, someone actually takes him up on it. Soon he is hopelessly out of his depth and his unhinged mental state deteriorates.</p> <h2>9. Florence Foster Jenkins (2016)</h2> <p>This biopic combines sentimentality, comedy and deep strangeness in equal measure. Meryl Streep plays the deluded amateur soprano and fashionable hostess Florence Foster Jenkins, whose off-key warbling at private events horrified 40s New York high society \u2013 but everyone was too polite to say anything, or too keen on Mrs Jenkins\u2019s lavish patronage and generosity to comment (other than giggling among themselves). Hugh Grant takes his career to the next level with a great performance as Jenkins\u2019s partner and husband in all but name, a failed thesp who sympathises with Florence\u2019s big dreams and wishes only to bring her some happiness. Streep and Grant are a lovely combination and their gentle chemistry, nurtured by Frears, allows this film to grow on you. At the end, you are laughing with them, not at them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5dd836c87ce703fc0b6e7ec33daa508584602d45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5dd836c87ce703fc0b6e7ec33daa508584602d45/0_68_3504_2104/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Meryl Streep in Florence Foster Jenkins\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hitting the right note: Meryl Streep in Florence Foster Jenkins.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Wall/Allstar/BBC Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>8. The Queen (2006)</h2> <p>Before there was The Crown, there was this movie, which bears about the same relationship to the racy TV show as Robert Altman\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/feb/01/1\">Gosford Park</a> does to the later small-screen romp Downton Abbey. Screenwriter Peter Morgan showed his witty post-Tussaud mastery of fabricating the private talk of the great and the good, and Helen Mirren gives a lovely, award-winning impersonation of the Queen during the great crisis of 1997 when Princess Diana had just died in a car accident and the public and press appeared to be genuinely turning against Her Majesty for the first time in her long reign. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/06/i-was-face-to-face-with-tony-blair-michael-sheen-on-murdoch-class-and-giving-away-his-money\">Michael Sheen </a>plays the young and guilelessly pushy new prime minister Tony Blair, who presumes to tell the Queen how to manage public opinion \u2014 and also wonders how her loss in reputation might result in a corresponding gain for his. Frears orchestrates all this with terrific brio and gusto, finding that keynote of comic indulgence amid the supposed seriousness and political gossip.</p> <h2>7. Dirty Pretty Things (2002)</h2> <p>This urban-myth thriller from screenwriter Steven Knight has all the ingredients that Frears knows how to blend: a strong, accessible, exciting (and scary) story and three fiercely drawn characters, played to the hilt by three outstandingly good actors \u2013 Chiwetel Ejiofor, Audrey Tautou and Sergi Lopez \u2013 whose contributions are managed with great skill by the director. Ejiofor is the Nigerian \u201cillegal\u201d in London, working as a hotel night porter and driving a minicab during the day; Tautou is the similarly illegal Turkish woman working as a chambermaid at the same hotel, and Lopez is the sinister hotel manager who informs them that hotels are places where discretion among staff is essential. When Tautou and Ejiofor discover a grisly criminal conspiracy, their story tells us something about inequality and exploitation and how London relies on immigrants as a servant class, who must be demonised so that their wages can be kept low and their working conditions poor. Frears paints the drama with a slightly broad brush, but this is a great, underrated British movie, as relevant today as ever.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8061b6a5a1ce69c18f107e6d957d5e41449616b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8061b6a5a1ce69c18f107e6d957d5e41449616b5/0_84_2439_1463/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Audrey Tautou and Chiwetel Ejiofor in Dirty Pretty Things\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Audrey Tautou and Chiwetel Ejiofor in Dirty Pretty Things.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/BBC Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>6. High Fidelity (2000)</h2> <p>In so many ways, High Fidelity is the perfect Frears project: relatable, smart, romantic, funny and sad, building on British wit to create a Hollywood picture with an indie sensibility. It was adapted from Nick Hornby\u2019s bestseller, transposing the action from north London to Chicago, and turning the hangdog, lovelorn owner of a record store (a retail concept that was more or less extinct even in 2000) into an American: John Cusack, whoalso co-wrote the film. The casting was perfect, and introduced Jack Black to a wider audience as Barry, the testy and massively opinionated music buff and store assistant who makes it his business to terrorise those customers whose tastes do not come up to scratch. Cusack\u2019s character has just been dumped, and all his misery and yearning are channelled into the music he loves. Is music where his fidelity or loyalty really lies, or can music be the gateway drug to real love and a real relationship? This film has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/nov/04/high-fidelity-musical-review-turbine-theatre-london-nick-hornby\">remade</a> and<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8577458/\"> re-franchised</a> over the past 20 years, but this is the original and best.</p> <h2>5. Dangerous Liaisons (1988)</h2> <p>Frears delivered power, intrigue and sexual menace with this story of elegant cynicism set in 18th-century France \u2013 a parable of the arrogant ennui that prefigured the revolution. Glenn Close and John Malkovich play the Marquise de Merteuil and the Vicomte de Valmont, former lovers who now jadedly amuse each other with their respective tales of adventures in seduction and the ruination of innocents. The Marquise spitefully bets the Vicomte that he can\u2019t have his way with a certain comely young woman (Uma Thurman), who has had the audacity to accept a marriage proposal from the Marquise\u2019s current lover, thus ending their arrangement. The Vicomte accepts the wager with alacrity and also sets out for another bedpost-notch: the lovely, virtuously married Madame de Tourvel, played by Michelle Pfeiffer. These liaisons are indeed dangerous in ways that the older epicures do not understand. They can fall in love, and fall in other ways as well. The central scene, when the entire theatre turns hissingly on the disgraced Marquise, is genuinely scary. The keynotes of drama and tragedy are atypical for Frears, but he handles them tremendously.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a58dc65d96c0deebc34e1e150eee1c63fc7912f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a58dc65d96c0deebc34e1e150eee1c63fc7912f5/0_141_3456_2073/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gary Oldman and Alfred Molina in Prick Up Your Ears\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gary Oldman and Alfred Molina in Prick Up Your Ears.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>4. Prick Up Your Ears (1987)</h2> <p>A recent re-release woke us up to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/03/prick-up-your-ears-review-joe-orton-stephen-frears-gary-oldman-alfred-molina\">what a belter this is</a>, and what a masterly exercise in drama and characterisation from Frears, who guides two cracking performances from Gary Oldman and Alfred Molina in a true story of scandal and tragedy. Oldman plays the brilliant and troubled young dramatist Joe Orton who, in the 1960s, set the London arts scene alight with his talentand made no secret of his homosexuality, but evaded censure in an era when it was still illegal. Molina is Kenneth Halliwell, his lover and best friend who becomes unstable and obsessively jealous of Orton\u2019s colossal success while his own career as an actor is fizzling out. Eventually, this toxic and dysfunctional relationship explodes into violence. Alan Bennett\u2019s tremendous script is based on John Lahr\u2019s biography with its cheeky, naughty pun in the title. Vanessa Redgrave has a cameo as Joe\u2019s legendary agent, Peggy Ramsay. It is the perfect Frears storm of great actors, smart script and absorbing drama.</p> <h2>3. My Beautiful Laundrette (1985)</h2> <p>Frears brings us a classic of 80s British cinema here, with its script by Hanif Kureishi, a film that refuses to run on the usual rails of commercial film-making or even on the rails of politically correct or right-on attitudising, despite boldly taking on racism and homophobia. A young and exquisitely beautiful Daniel Day-Lewis plays Johnny, a racist thug who appears to be about to attack Omar (played by Gordon Warnecke). He is a south Asian guy of Pakistani extraction whose wealthy, worldly uncle has put him in charge of one of his laundrettes, one of a string of faintly dodgy business interests. But there is a complication: Johnny and Omar are lovers, and their relationship finds a kind of ironic symbol in the laundrette that may yet get turned into an unlikely thing of beauty. And so the film unexpectedly and subversively taps into the new Thatcherite enthusiasm for small-business entrepreneurialism (it was a time when Thatcher\u2019s Enterprise Allowance Scheme, while undoubtedly intended to keep unemployment figures low, was taken up by many in the leftie arts world).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9633f9663ba204415fb3dbcd3f1e1ba34d6bee9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9633f9663ba204415fb3dbcd3f1e1ba34d6bee9/0_147_2745_1648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Cusack (right) in The Grifters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Cusack (right) in The Grifters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Palace Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>2. The Grifters (1990)</h2> <p>A modern classic about con artists, this also stars Cusack and is adapted by Donald Westlake from the novel by pulp master <a href=\"http://www.crimetime.co.uk/cigarettes-and-alchohol-the-extraordinary-life-of-jim-thompson/\">Jim Thompson</a>, but finds something a little softer and more emollient than might otherwise be the case for Thompson (less shocking, for example, than his The Killer Inside Me). Cusack plays Roy, a small-time confidence trickster whose mother (and fellow con artist) Lilly, played by Anjelica Huston, takes an instant dislike to Roy\u2019s new girlfriend Myra (Annette Bening). This emotional triangulation is the driving force behind calamitous new criminal complications, involving an awful psychological disclosure. In some ways, the most devastating moment comes with Roy\u2019s first misjudgment: a silly little scam to trick bartenders out of high-denomination bills winds up with him getting punched in the stomach by his intended victim with shocking ferocity. When a cop stops to ask the hunched-over Roy if he is all right, Roy obviously can\u2019t say what\u2019s happened and, suppressing gasps of agony has to make light of it, claiming to have food poisoning: a symbol of the self-destructive and dishonest denial that has been going on his whole life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"16b67014b5e10f2ac1077692899636d2caab73ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16b67014b5e10f2ac1077692899636d2caab73ce/0_0_2784_1672/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Judi Dench and Steve Coogan in 2013\u2019s Philomena\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Judi Dench and Steve Coogan in 2013\u2019s Philomena.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Bailey/Allstar/BBC Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>1. Philomena (2013)</h2> <p>Frears\u2019 <em>chef-d\u2019oeuvre </em>has everything: accessibly rooted in a true story, it has a powerful but controlled display of emotions, is tempered with poignancy and wit, and has great performances from stars and supporting cast. Judi Dench gives one of her best ever performances as Philomena Lee, a tough Irish woman who is on a mission to find out what happened to the baby boy that was taken from her when she became pregnant in the 1950s and was sent to one of Ireland\u2019s notorious \u201cMagdalene laundries\u201d. These were workhouse-style homes for unwed young mothers that allowed childless Catholic couples from the United States to come and adopt the wretched women\u2019s babies in return for a cash donation to the church (naturally, the mothers themselves were not allowed a say in the matter). In effect, a machine for turning shame into money. Steve Coogan plays Martin Sixsmith, the former journalist and New Labour spin doctor who has recently endured a shame of his own relating to a leaked email. It is Sixsmith who helps Philomena on her mission to confront the arrogant hypocrisy of the church. Dench gives a lovely performance as Philomena and Coogan \u2013 whose acting skills are often undervalued \u2013 is excellent as well. It is a film with all the components for a Frears gem, and the most important is heart. Its compassion and tenderness radiate from the screen. </p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 April 2020 to correct a misspelling of Anjelica Huston\u2019s first name as \u201cAngelica\u201d. <br></p>",

A story on 13 October 1918 in the New York Times gave the details:</p> <p><em>\u201cBoxing in the East is now at a standstill, because of the epidemic of Spanish influenza. Promoters in Philadelphia, Boston, and New Jersey, in compliance with requests issued by their different Health Departments, have agreed to close up shop. How long the sport will be idle remains to be seen, but it is positive that no matches of any importance will be undertaken while the epidemic continues.\u201d</em></p> <p>Boxing clubs across the country closed as they prepared to deal with the virus ravaging their cities. One of the affected fights was between heavyweight contender Jack Dempsey and light-heavyweight champion Battling Levinsky, who were scheduled to compete in October 1918 in Philadelphia.</p> <p>While fights across much of the country were sidelined during October \u2013 one of the deadliest months for the pandemic in the United States \u2013 the shutdown did not last long. The 27 October 1918 edition of the Milwaukee Journal revealed that \u201cNovember promises to be replete with boxing action, that is, if the Spanish flu ever takes the count.\u201d Another headline from that same date in the Cleveland Plain Dealer read, \u201cBoxing is Resumed Gradually in East as Flu Ban Moves.\u201d</p> <p>The Dempsey v Levinsky bout eventually went ahead on 6 November, and Dempsey defeated Levinsky by third round KO. Dempsey would go on to fight 11 more times during the pandemic, including his lineal heavyweight title win against Jess Willard in July 1919. Other notable boxers such as Gene Tunney, Harry Greb, San Langford, and Benny Leonard fought dozens of times during the pandemic.</p> <p>Despite boxing returning to business as usual in late 1918, several boxers succumbed to the virus, including heavyweight Jim Johnson, Terry Martin, Matty Baldwin, Jim Stewart, Samuel Ranzino, Joe Stein, Al Thomas, and Joe Tuber. Boxing promoter Paddy Carroll and boxing club owner Lorenzo Snow also died from the virus. Canadian sports promoter George Kennedy, who promoted wrestling, boxing, and was best known as the owner of the Montreal Canadiens ice hockey team, contracted the Spanish flu during the pandemic and never fully recovered, eventually passing away from complications related to the illness in 1921.</p> <p>Several other renowned boxers contracted the virus but managed to recover. Retired heavyweight Jim Jeffries, a former world heavyweight champion who was most famous for being the \u201cGreat White Hope\u201d for attempting to dethrone African American heavyweight champ Jack Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/jul/04/jack-johnson-pioneer-black-boxer\">in the 1910 \u2018Fight of the Century\u2019</a>, made a surprise recovery in November 1918 at age 43.</p> <p>It remains unclear how many boxers contracted the virus while competing during the pandemic. What we do know, however, is that there were very few policies implemented to mitigate the spread of the virus. Fans were allowed to attend the events, while hygiene was not generally of the standard it is today. UFC has said it will hold events without a live audience but it still plays a dangerous game if it wants fighters to brawl in close quarters during a pandemic \u2013 and that\u2019s before the threat to officials and televisions crews, not to mention the fact that traveling across the country risks spreading the virus to different communities.</p> <p>UFC President Dana White remains defiant though. And while he was unable to go ahead with the UFC 249 pay-per-view event, he maintains that the UFC will be the \u201cfirst sport back\u201d and that \u201cFight Island is real\u201d. On Wednesday, he said he plans to host an event <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/ufc/story/_/id/29036726/ufc-president-dana-white-eyes-9-next-event-tbd-location\">as soon as 9 May</a>.</p> <p>While governments and hospitals are better prepared to handle a pandemic now than they were a century ago thanks to a medical revolution and the lack of world wars depleting infrastructure and services, it is important that sports leagues and organizations refrain from taking any reckless action during a global health crisis. Instead, promotions such as the UFC should look back on history and learn from the mistakes of the previous pandemics.</p>",
  "<p>More people may be dying from coronavirus in care homes and the community than in hospitals, according to a leaked letter from care bosses that accuses ministers of a bias towards the NHS and treating social care as \u201can afterthought\u201d.</p> \n<p>In a three-page attack on government strategy, seen by the Guardian, the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (Adass) said national delivery of protective equipment to care homes had been \u201cshambolic\u201d, the government had fallen short on testing of care staff and residents, and it had provided \u201ccontradictory messages\u201d about how to shield vulnerable people.</p> \n<p>The letter lays bare tensions between the highly devolved care sector and the Department of Health and Social Care, led by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, which has focused on extending the capacity of the NHS to cope with a peak in cases.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Covid-19 now appears to be sweeping through council- and privately run care homes, with some operators estimating that up to two-thirds of their residents are infected.</p> \n<p>The care chiefs said they were \u201cextremely unhappy\u201d with communications from the ministry before Easter and issued an 11-point list of complaints, concluding: \u201cWe and our staff are working flat out.\u201d</p> \n<p>The letter was sent on Saturday, since when Hancock has announced a new social care strategy including making testing available for all care staff and residents, although no deadline has been set. He said that in three weeks a new online delivery system for PPE would become available linked to the NHS supply system.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus-key-workers\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus-key-workers&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus-key-workers</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>But the council bosses responsible for commissioning care for hundreds of thousands of people put on record what many in the care sector are beginning to fear, which is that \u201cthere is a risk that there are greater levels of deaths in social care and in the community than in hospitals\u201d.</p> \n<p>So far there have been 12,868 deaths from Covid-19 in the NHS in England and Wales. Figures from care homes are not being collected in the same way. The latest industry estimates suggest the death toll in England from confirmed or suspected cases of the virus is at least 1,400 and is likely to be significantly higher.</p> \n<p>The Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/15/uk-care-home-inspectors-did-not-ask-about-covid-19-deaths-until-april\">revealed</a> on Wednesday that the sector\u2019s regulator, the Care Quality Commission, only started asking care homes specifically whether people were dying from confirmed or suspected Covid-19 last Thursday.</p> \n<p>While new Nightingale field hospitals have been built with military help for the NHS to cope with an anticipated peak in intensive care admissions, many care homes have complained they cannot access enough personal protective equipment to keep their staff and residents safe. They have also reported staffing and materials costs rising by around 20% while funding has stayed broadly static.</p> \n<p>The letter, addressed to Jonathan Marron, the director general of community and social care at the DHSC, said: \u201cWe are very concerned that there is a significant imbalance between listening, hearing and understanding NHS England as opposed to social care.\u201d</p> \n<p>It said social care bosses were unhappy at \u201csocial care appearing as an afterthought in recognition, monitoring mortality and morbidity and a whole host of other areas.\u201d</p> \n<p>On Wednesday Hancock sought to respond to growing criticism that social care was being left behind in government thinking. \u201cFrom the moment of the emergence of coronavirus we have known that some of the most vulnerable to the disease are in social care,\u201d he said at a Downing Street briefing.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have been taking action right from the start. Our goal throughout has been to protect residents and support our 1.5 million colleagues who work in social care. We have injected an extra \u00a31.6bn and, as the chancellor said, we will do whatever it takes.\u201d</p> \n<p>Adass criticised the delivery of PPE through a national system that it said was not working. It said early deliveries were \u201cpaltry\u201d and more recent drops had been \u201chaphazard\u201d.</p> \n<p>Many care homes have said they have received only 300 face masks from the national stocks, which in a reasonably sized facility can be used up in a day. There had been reports \u201cthat orders from abroad have been confiscated by Borders and Immigration for the NHS\u201d, Adass complained.</p> \n<p>With many care operators working with 10% to 20% of their staff self-isolating and therefore stretched, Adass said it was \u201cshameful\u201d that the creation of the National NHS volunteer scheme had not been done in collaboration with councils and it had \u201cdiverted 750,000 volunteers away from supporting local communities and left them with nothing to do for the first three weeks of the epidemic\u201d.</p> \n<p>Sam Monaghan, the chief executive of charitable care home operator MHA, said the memo was a \u201cfair and accurate analysis of the situation over the past few weeks\u201d. By 9am on Thursday it had lost 251 residents to suspected or confirmed Covid-19 across 222 facilities.<br><br>Monaghan said: \u201cWe have said from the outset that we were being treated like the poor relation to the NHS when in reality we are the second frontline. Each and every one of these deaths is devastating for families of residents and also for our colleagues who have been working tirelessly to both care for residents and also keep themselves safe. We can only speculate what a difference adequate levels of testing including contact tracing and ample, readily available supplies of PPE could have made.\u201d<br><br>A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cThe government has set out a comprehensive action plan to support the adult social care sector in England throughout the coronavirus outbreak, including ramping up testing, overhauling the way PPE is being delivered to care homes and helping to minimise the spread of the virus to keep people safe. We will continue to work closely with the social care sector to ensure they have everything they need to respond to this outbreak and receive the recognition they deserve.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>Point Roberts is a geographical anomaly. The small town on a five-square-mile peninsula is connected solely to Canada, but it extends just below the 49th parallel, officially making it part of the US.</p> <p>Getting to Point Roberts from Washington, the closest American state, means traveling by private boat, flying into its single-runway airport or driving 27 miles through the south-west corner of Canada, passing through two international border crossings.</p> <p>But it is this unique isolation that has helped keep the 1,300 residents of Point Roberts out of the crosshairs of the coronavirus pandemic so far.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably the safest place to be in the country,\u201d said Pamala Sheppard, 65, who has lived in Point Roberts since 1989.</p> <p>\u201cBecause our borders are shut, we\u2019re like an island right now,\u201d she added. \u201cWe\u2019re like an island with no boats.\u201d</p> <p>In an effort to curb the spread of the virus, last month the US and Canada agreed to temporarily close their borders to all non-essential travel. While food, fuel and other goods can still get through, everyone else faces much stiffer requirements.</p> <p>The decision largely cut off the already fairly insulated town from Canadian visitors, but also from the rest of its own country.</p> <p>Christopher Carleton, Point Roberts fire chief, said on a typical weekend in 2019, the town would see about 2,000 cars travel over its border, many of whom are tourists. That number has now dipped below 100.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/apr/2020-04-15T17:25:54.html\" data-alt=\"Point Roberts locator\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/apr/2020-04-15T17:25:54.html\">Point Roberts locator</a> </figure>  <p>Point Roberts residents are still able to get over the border for essential travel, such as doctor\u2019s appointments and to pick up prescription medications. But anyone trying to get into the town who is not a resident and has no family they are coming in to take care of, would have a difficult time getting past border agents, he explained.</p> <p>\u201cEconomically it\u2019s hurting our community, as with any community that\u2019s going through this at this point, but it is in a sense also protecting our community,\u201d Carleton told the Guardian.</p> <p>Carleton said locally there are no known cases of Covid-19 in the community. He said there was the possibility that a resident traveled on their own to mainland US for a diagnosis, but no cases have been reported to the town\u2019s first responders.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s probably the safest place to be in the country.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A coronavirus outbreak in Point Roberts could be devastating. Carleton said about 70% of its residents are 60 or older, the age group considered to be at higher risk of severe illness if infected.</p> <p>The town only has a clinic with a nurse practitioner and physician\u2019s assistant, and while it does have Emergency Medical Services (EMS) prepared to respond to any patients reporting symptoms of coronavirus, paramedics would have to transport seriously ill patients to mainland US to reach a hospital.</p> <p>Carleton said patients could be transported by ground through Canada or by helicopter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0e04aaac91fe538c2e5c2696f58d07df74f60214\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e04aaac91fe538c2e5c2696f58d07df74f60214/0_0_5223_7811/669.jpg\" alt=\"The US and Canadian flags fly in Point Roberts.\" width=\"669\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The US and Canadian flags fly in Point Roberts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Max Lindenthaler/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As of Tuesday, the US has seen 609,531 cases, including 26,057 deaths, according to the count maintained by Johns Hopkins University.

On the day she spoke with the Guardian, she said she and her husband were planning to go out for a beach date with some friends. They each planned to sit 10 feet apart, and fully expected not to see anyone else out there at the same time.</p> <p>When she leaves her half-acre property to go to the local grocery store, she wears a mask and gloves, and she\u2019s cut down her border crossings from twice a day to only twice in the past three weeks. She said her most recent trip to pick up chicken food involved a 20-minute interview at the Canadian border, where she was asked about her reason for traveling and whether she or anyone she knew had been sick.</p> <p>But she\u2019s also noticed the economic impacts of the outbreak firsthand. Her shop, Auntie Pam\u2019s Country Store, which sells everything from organic soap to cashmere scarfs, had to close a few weeks ago because it\u2019s not considered an essential business.</p> <p>She joked that the store is the \u201cnumber one tourist attraction\u201d on the peninsula, since there\u2019s not really any other shops in the community apart from the grocery store. But on a more serious note, she said if she was not able to open this summer, the busiest season, she would have to shut what she calls her \u201cdream store\u201d for good.</p> <p>Theresa Coe, 57, who works at the Point Roberts Marina, said she had noticed fewer boats coming in and out of the town, probably owing to the fact that most at the marina are Canadian-owned. All recreational fishing has also been closed in Washington state until at least 4 May.</p> <p>Coe, who has lived in Point Roberts since 2008, said when she drives the mile and a half from her home to the marina each day, she doesn\u2019t see anyone on the streets, and the typically full grocery store parking lot has only a few cars.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the safest place in probably North America; definitely within the states,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have US customs coming in and Canadian customs going out. Nothing\u2019s going to happen here or very little.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Margaret Atwood, who has created dystopias from Gilead to the collapsed civilisation of Oryx and Crake, has spoken: our locked-down world might be \u201can unpleasant, frightening, disagreeable place you don\u2019t want to be\u201d, but it is not dystopian.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p089krk9\">Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live\u2019s Emma Barnett</a>, Atwood said that \u201ca dystopia, technically, is an arranged unpleasant society that you don\u2019t want to be living in. This one was not arranged. So people may be making arrangements that aren\u2019t too pleasant, but it\u2019s not a deliberate totalitarianism. It\u2019s not a deliberate arrangement.\u201d</p> <p>What it is, said Atwood, is \u201can emergency crisis\u201d. \u201cBeing in an unpleasant situation such as the blitz, that\u2019s not a dystopia. It\u2019s an unpleasant, frightening, disagreeable place you don\u2019t want to be, but it wasn\u2019t arranged by a government that is in control of you,\u201d said the author of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.</p> <p>Atwood compared the conspiracy theories about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/07/how-false-claims-about-5g-health-risks-spread-into-the-mainstream\">5G spreading the coronavirus</a> to reactions when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/12/inequality-pandemic-lockdown\">the plague hit Europe in the 14th century</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWhen there\u2019s an epidemic of panic, people long for something to blame, because if you can find the thing to blame, you can eliminate the threat,\u201d she said. \u201cSo during the Black Death the following people got blamed pretty much in this order: lepers, as they went from town to town; Gypsies, because they travelled around; Jews, for all of the usual reasons. And witches, you know about those witches? Just causing plagues all over the place. So if you could if you could destroy all those people then maybe you wouldn\u2019t have the plague. I guess the impulse is always to burn something.\u201d</p> <p>The conspiracies around 5G have led to phone masts being attacked and burned. \u201cAt least they\u2019re not burning people yet,\u201d said the two-time Booker prize winner.</p> <p>Atwood also criticised how politicians have been using <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/21/donald-trump-boris-johnson-coronavirus\">warlike language to describe their approach to the pandemic</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI mean lucky old you if you\u2019ve got a good immune system and probably nice medical care. But because somebody doesn\u2019t come through, doesn\u2019t mean they weren\u2019t a fighter. It\u2019s a \u2018blame the victim\u2019 kind of thing \u2013 they didn\u2019t fight hard. So I don\u2019t use that kind of language about it. It\u2019s not a war.\u201d</p> <p>She predicted that the crisis would lead to the world valuing health workers and universal healthcare a lot more. \u201cYou can see the kind of chaos that\u2019s going on south of the border,\u201d said the Canadian author. \u201cSome states just aren\u2019t getting support, and they don\u2019t have plans and things are really quite difficult there. Let us also not forget we\u2019ve had these alarms before, we even had plans for dealing with pandemics. And then when there wasn\u2019t a pandemic, they got put on the shelf and and a lot of countries just were not ready for this, which they could have been had they remembered.\u201d</p> <p>Atwood, whose partner Graeme Gibson died in September, said that life has been \u201cdifficult, ever since September, but I\u2019ve had some practice being alone. And, yes it\u2019s difficult, but I\u2019m not alone on the planet.\u201d</p> <p>On Wednesday, it was announced that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/15/margaret-atwood-showcase-gothic-puppet-show-mary-beard-bbc\">Atwood was putting </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/15/margaret-atwood-showcase-gothic-puppet-show-mary-beard-bbc\">on an \u201cisolation puppet show\u201d</a> of Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s The Masque of the Red Death, with her sister, Ruth, for the BBC\u2019s Front Row Late on Thursday night.</p> <p>Classicist Mary Beard, who is presenting the show, said the puppets were constructed of \u201cthings they happened to have around the house\u201d, including a starring role for some hand sanitiser. \u201cIt\u2019s as funny and engaging as it sounds,\u201d she said.</p>",
  "<p><strong>I\u2019d wanted to play the Phantom since I was 12.</strong> I saw it on a school trip. I had been a typical small-town Canadian boy who played ice hockey. My life changed that day. I wanted to make people feel like I\u2019d just been made to feel. Colm Wilkinson was extraordinary in the role \u2013 it was almost as if every note he sang would be his last. Because I came from such a small town, ignorance was bliss. If I told anyone that\u2019s what I wanted to do, they\u2019d say: \u201cCool, OK!\u201d No one told you me how hard it would be.</p> <p><strong>The Phantom is unhinged.</strong> He kills people, he\u2019s manipulative, but there\u2019s something about him as an underdog. This is what society has created. How can you not have compassion or empathy for him?</p> <p><strong>I couldn\u2019t get into the role when we were rehearsing.</strong> But putting the makeup and the mask on helped. Usually it\u2019s good to work in a character\u2019s shoes \u2013 with this part I needed the face and mask. I was in my attic the other day and found a bunch of them from Phantom and the sequel, Love Never Dies.

That time period \u2013 known as the access period \u2013 will now be reduced to a minimum of one day. </strong></p> \n  <p>Importantly, employers will still need to meet the essential conditions required under the \u201cgenuine agreement\u201d test that is ultimately determined by the Fair Work Commission. This is a safeguard to ensure workers are able to make informed decisions about changes affecting the way they work. Employees will also still be able to vote down a proposed change to agreements.</p> \n  <p>These changes have also been time-bound and will revert to the usual 7 day period automatically in six months. Having listened to concerns raised by the ACTU, the Attorney-General has also determined to review the operation of the changes in two months to assess whether the system has been operating effectively without misuse. If substantial evidence were to emerge that the changes are not operating effectively, the time period can be altered again at that point of two-month review.</p> \n  <p>Importantly, the regulation change applies to all businesses with employees covered by EBA\u2019s, including those not eligible for JobKeeper payments.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThese changes are designed to enable companies to deal swiftly with urgent issues that are arising in their workplaces, such as health and safety issues associated with COVID-19,\u201d Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations, Christian Porter said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cFor example, businesses that have urgently needed to divide their workforce up into teams that rotate between working from home and in the office for social distancing reasons, haven\u2019t been able to quickly implement those changes due to the mandatory access period.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIn some cases, delays have been impractical and prevented employers from taking effective steps to improve the safety of their staff, or to ensure their businesses were able to function efficiently during these difficult and fast-changing times.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThese changes are only temporary and will expire in six months, in line with other changes to working arrangements that have been recently adopted, such as the amendments to the Fair Work Act that were necessary to facilitate the roll out of the $130 billion JobKeeper package and I intend to review the operation of the change two months after it becomes effective.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e97f4308f08cf571cdb1ed1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T05:59:32.208Z\">6.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The ACTU and <strong>Sally McManus</strong> is not:<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cSome employers have not stopped demanding rights be taken off working people. We saw some openly try to force changes to the Fair Work Act that would undermine people\u2019s job security and rights at work in the lead up to Jobkeeper becoming law, those attempts were opposed by the union movement and were rightly refused by all political parties.</p> \n  <p>\u201cHaving been denied a legislative pathway for their power grab those employers, who have not suffered serious downturn, have spent the last week lobbying the government to take away workers\u2019 rights via regulation, they should be condemned, and the Government should stop listening to them.</p> \n  <p>\u201cBy agreeing to these changes Christian Porter would be using his power to abolish rules that protect workers, their job security and their rights at work.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThese changes will allow employers to ram through reductions in pay and undermine job security.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe current rules ensure workers have adequate time to consider any proposal to change an enterprise agreement, to discuss this with their employer, other workers and to seek advice. This change effectively takes away all these rights leaving workers exposed to employers seeking to exploit the fear caused by the pandemic and to pressure workers into rushed agreements, locking out their access to advice.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe are already seeing widespread abuse of the JobKeeper system, prior to the pandemic Australian business had an enormous problem with wage theft. We know that, sadly, too many employers will exploit the system if there are no safeguards for working people. The Government needs to stand up to big business and rule out undermining the job security and rights of millions of Australian workers.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWorkers need more protections and safeguards at this time, not less.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T06:12:21.266Z\">at 7.12am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e97f3f98f08cf571cdb1ec8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T05:58:54.869Z\">6.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>On that post from Paul Karp a little bit ago, there have been, as you could imagine, mixed responses.</p> \n  <p>The Business Council of Australia is very happy:<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cWe thank the Attorney-General for listening and acting on the concerns of our members.

return soon.</p> \n  <p>But he adds this:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>And while I have my criticisms of the WHO, and they are very valid criticisms, we have to remember it may have had a few poor outings lately but there are also some very important work they have been doing and I will make reference to it. </p> \n   <p>WHO has responded in our Pacific family to 300 requests from the Pacific, 68 shipments of PPE, 35 deployments to countries assisting Fiji with the testing capability, establishing Covid-19 isolation facilities in Timor-Leste, this is the same grade three there in the summer measles outbreak of last year, the polio outbreak in PNG in 2018 and they do work in the western Pacific on eliminating measles, rubella and tetanus, preventing diabetes and hypertension, maintaining high levels of polio vaccination, the state of essential medicines and vaccines, eliminating mother to child transmission of HIV.</p> \n   <p> I know they have had their criticism, and it has been quite deserved and we have been frustrated, but they do do important work and they do important here in the Pacific and we will keep working with them, but it won\u2019t be uncritical.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"87c33812b429f365e027c4f124acdb26abb360df\"> \n   <img

In short, leaders emphasise the value of providing education within classroom settings, but acknowledge that it is up to state and territory governments and the non-government school sector to make operational decisions. <br></p> \n  <p>There is also a need for schools to offer teachers and staff a safe working environment.</p> \n  <p>The full list of principles is as follows:</p> \n  <p>1. Our schools are critical to the delivery of high quality education for students and to give our children the best possible start in life. Our education systems are based on the recognition that education is best delivered by professional teachers to students in the classroom on a school campus.</p> \n  <p>2. It is accepted that during the Covid-19 crisis, alternative flexible, remote delivery of education services may be needed.</p> \n  <p>3. Our schools must be healthy and safe environments for students, teachers and other staff to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of education to students.</p> \n  <p>4. State and territory governments and non-government sector authorities are responsible for managing and making operational decisions for their school systems respectively, subject to compliance with relevant funding agreements with the Commonwealth.</p> \n  <p>5. Decisions regarding the response to Covid-19 in the schooling sector must continue to be informed by expert, official, national and state-based public health and education advice, consistent with these national principles.</p> \n  <p>6. All students must continue to be supported by their school to ensure participation in quality education during the Covid-19 crisis.</p> \n  <p>7. The health advice consistently provided by the AHPPC is that attendance at a school campus for education represents a very low risk to students. <br></p> \n  <p>The advice also notes that appropriate practices must be employed at schools, like at other workplaces, to provide a safe working environment for school staff, including teachers, and that the specific AHPPC advice regarding school campuses should be followed.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e97e34c8f0895d83068ef2e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T04:48:48.444Z\">5.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Election promises need to be 'reconsidered'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is the first time <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> has admitted that the policies he took to the election can\u2019t stand up in a post-Covid Australia:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>They also highlighted, though, the need to make sure on the other side of the virus, as we make our road out, <strong>that any sense of business as usual when it comes to the policy framework we had at the election will need to be reconsidered on the other side.</strong> <br></p> \n   <p><strong>To make sure we can achieve growth that will be necessary for our economy to get people back into work, economy back on track, it will be a different world on the other side of the virus and there will be many challenges,</strong> and the national cabinet has a very good appreciation of this, and there has been some talk about its role on the other side of the virus, and that is a discussion for another day. <br></p> \n   <p>But between now and as we continue to work through the impact of the virus, the national cabinet will have on its agenda the types of things and policy measures take together, working at federal and state level to make sure we can give our economy every support and more importantly every freedom to be able to get on and see businesses grow on the other side.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T04:51:28.355Z\">at 5.51am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e97e3308f0895d83068ef2d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T04:47:05.897Z\">5.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Scott Morrison:</strong><br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Our intention has now been turning to the road out, having worked through the road in. <br></p> \n   <p>That road to recovery on the other side as well. <br></p> \n   <p>Importantly today at national cabinet we received quite extensive briefings from the governor of the Reserve Bank and the secretary of Treasury, Dr Kennedy. <br></p> \n   <p>At those briefings it was reinforced again to the national cabinet on a point that we strongly concur with the need to synchronise our health and economic responses to the virus.

the journalist <strong>Annika Smethurst</strong>\u2019s high court case, which found the warrant used to raid her home was invalid, but was split on what the AFP could do with the materials it seized.</p> \n  <p>(<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/15/high-court-rules-afp-warrant-for-raid-on-news-corp-journalists-home-was-invalid\">Paul Karp has covered the case here</a>.)</p> \n  <p>The Law Council of Australia has responded to the case outcome, rightly pointing out the issues with Australia\u2019s public interest journalism protections:<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Pauline Wright</strong><em>:</em><em><br></em></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The Law Council remains concerned about the adequacy of public interest protections where warrants authorise investigative action involving journalists and media organisations, whether they are suspected of having committed an offence or whether they are simply third parties who may be in possession of information. </p> \n   <p><strong>The law continues to leave journalists and media organisations exposed to possible police investigation and prosecution. </strong></p> \n   <p>The Law Council believes that any similar case in the future could be avoided through law reform measures to protect and recognise the importance of public interest journalism and to incorporate greater accountability mechanisms. Protections might include contested hearings, the involvement of a Public Interest Advocate to test the warrant process and a requirement that warrants may only be issued by a judge of a superior court of record. </p> \n   <p>Australia\u2019s media is critical to holding government and its agencies accountable for their actions and scrutinising the exercise of power. Transparency and accountability lead to better decision-making and a stronger democracy that protects rights and freedoms and upholds the rule of law. This case is a reminder of the ongoing vulnerability of public interest journalism within the current legal framework. </p> \n   <p>We will continue to call for stronger protections to provide an essential balance in the face of the extensive powers Australia has given our law enforcement and security agencies. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T00:20:57.499Z\">at 1.20am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e979ca68f08ea7431f439f7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/ben-butler\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T23:46:06.560Z\">12.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Shares in Virgin Australia have been suspended from trade as the grounded airline desperately seeks a bailout.<br></p> \n  <p>The stock went into a trading halt two days ago but has so far been unable to secure a lifeline amid furious political debate over whether it should be rescued by the government.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cWhilst this consideration and these discussions have continued over the last two days including discussions which remain confidential and are incomplete, the company is not presently in a position to make an announcement to the market with respect to these matters,\u201d Virgin Australia told the exchange on Thursday morning.<br></p> \n  <p>As Guardian Australia has reported, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/virgin-australia-considers-going-into-administration-as-labor-calls-for-government-rescue\">options under consideration include putting the company into administration</a>.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T23:50:33.262Z\">at 12.50am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e979bdc8f08ea7431f439f6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T23:45:38.701Z\">12.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Most of these seem legit to me.

  "<p>Good evening, and welcome to our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Naaman Zhou bringing you the main stories on Thursday 16 April.</p> \n<h2>Morrison lays out three conditions for restrictions to be lifted</h2> \n<p>The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said current restrictions would continue for at least four weeks but there are three conditions that need to be met before they are eased. They are: increased testing, better contact tracing (\u201clifted to an industrial capability\u201d) and the ability to lock down localised areas, similar to what happened in the Tasmanian north-west this week. Morrison also says some of the Coalition\u2019s election \u201cpolicy framework\u201d may not be able to be delivered once the crisis is over.</p> \n<h2>Stuart Robert claims app swaps phone numbers</h2> \n<p>The minister for government services, Stuart Robert, has said the government\u2019s proposed coronavirus tracking app <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joshgnosis/status/1250636195253501952\">will work by swapping the mobile phone numbers </a>of people who are in close proximity. The app, which Morrison has said will roll out in 14 days, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/15/coronavirus-tracking-app-to-be-rolled-out-in-australia-only-with-privacy-safeguards-minister\">may be delayed as the attorney general checks it for privacy concerns</a>. Robert\u2019s comments sparked confusion as to which app (of many kinds) the government would use. \u201c[If] we are in close proximity for 15 minutes because we are waiting in a queue, our mobile phone numbers would swap securely,\u201d he said as an example.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a></strong>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>All Ruby Princess crew to be tested within 48 hours</h2> \n<p>All 1,100 crew on board the virus-stricken Ruby Princess <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/16/all-ruby-princess-cruise-ship-coronavirus-crew-tested-covid-19-within-48-hours\">will be tested for Covid-19 by Saturday, NSW Health announced</a>. Currently only 25% of crew have been tested, with half of those tested returning positive results. More broadly, NSW authorities also signalled towards testing anyone with mild symptoms. The premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said that anybody who \u201cworks in an industry where you are in contact with a lot of people\u201d, especially vulnerable people, should get tested if they have symptoms. Previously that only applied to people in certain suburbs.</p> \n<h2>24 hours to change EBAs</h2> \n<p>The industrial relations minister, Christian Porter, announced a change to workplace laws that gives workers only 24 hours to consider changes made by their employers to their enterprise bargaining agreements. Previously, if an employer moved to change an EBA, workers had seven days to consider it before voting to accept or reject. That has now been changed to 24 hours, in what the Labor party said was \u201crobbing workers of an important safeguard\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/16/all-ruby-princess-cruise-ship-coronavirus-crew-tested-covid-19-within-48-hours\">All Ruby Princess crew to be tested for Covid-19 within 48 hours</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>Immigration detention centre protest</h2> \n<p>Armed riot police entered Sydney\u2019s Villawood immigration detention centre to end a protest by refugees who were worried about the danger Covid-19 posed to their health while in detention. Three men had been protesting on the roof of the Blaxland compound since Saturday but were removed by police on Thursday. Refugee advocates say they do not know where they are now.</p> \n<h2>School guidelines</h2> \n<p>The federal government <a href=\"https://twitter.com/samanthamaiden/status/1250643366959656960/photo/1\">announced a broad set of national principles</a> about the return to school, but said that states and territories still retain the ultimate control.

Closed airports, bonded labour, or other forms of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/feb/26/time-to-end-kafala\">unbreakable employment contracts</a>, and little access to funds, have made it close to impossible for those who want to leave to do so.</p> <p>In Lebanon, where an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/07/lebanon-to-default-on-debt-for-first-time-amid-financial-crisis#maincontent\">economic meltdown</a> had already shattered household incomes before the coronavirus lockdown, both Amnesty International and the International Labour Organization fear many domestic workers are no longer being paid. There are concerns that, with families confined to homes, workers have been forced into more intensive and dangerous work, facing obsessive demands to clean inside homes and dangerous xenophobia on rare trips outside.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cAs one of the most marginalised groups in Lebanon, the government needs to clearly warn that it will prosecute employers who exploit or abuse migrant domestic workers. It should also ensure they are granted access to healthcare during the pandemic,\u201d said Heba Morayef, Amnesty International\u2019s Middle East and North Africa regional director.</p> <p>In Lebanon, the 250,000-strong migrant workforce consists primarily of domestic workers, who usually live in the homes of their employers.</p> <p>In the Gulf Cooperation Countries (GCC), where foreign workers make up 90% of the population of the United Arab Emirates, 60% in Kuwait, 50% in Bahrain, and 33% in Saudi Arabia, large numbers of migrant workers are instead housed in labour camps. Many have been stood down since the coronavirus outbreak, and can neither depart for their home countries, nor leave their compounds. Social distancing is very difficult and access to advanced healthcare is often limited.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/fears-over-hidden-covid-19-outbreak-in-lebanon-iraq-and-syria\">Fears over hidden Covid-19 outbreak in Lebanon, Iraq and Syria</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While official coronavirus numbers in the Gulf states are relatively low compared with Iran, the region\u2019s most seriously affected country, there are concerns that <a href=\"https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/poor-cramped-living-working-conditions-for-gulf-migrant-workers-laid-bare-by-covid-19-pandemic\">migrant camps</a> are dangerous incubators for the virus, and are not adequately checked by authorities who give precedence to citizens and expatriate residents.</p> <p>When the region\u2019s airports eventually open, potentially by the end of Ramadan in late May, some GCC countries are expecting laid-off skilled and unskilled workers to leave in numbers if they can still afford to do so.</p> <p>In the meantime, several million others face what NGOs believe to be a heightened risk and increasing uncertainty.</p> <p>The coronavirus crisis has crippled employment across the Gulf and could spell ruin for construction, retail and other sectors.

  "<p>An American woman who travelled to the UK to help her heavily pregnant daughter has claimed she was told to go back to the US by border officials at Heathrow on the grounds that her journey was not \u201cessential\u201d.</p> <p>The 63-year-old woman, who had flown in from Washington DC on Monday, said she was reduced to tears by the hostile experience at passport control.</p> <p>\u201cI was so upset that I couldn\u2019t help but start crying,\u201d said Yoshie Rymar. \u201cThe agent told me to go to the ticketing counter to get a return ticket and go back to US.

So I expected the same way when my turn came. However, I was wearing a black-knit cap, glasses and a mask to protect myself. I was told to take those off because it was hard for us to communicate. He was irritated by my request to repeat his question.</p> <p>\u201cI explained how my daughter needed me because of her pregnancy and toddler. There was an agent next to him who was talking loud and my hearing was not so great, he was pretty irritated again.

  "<p>To a certain way of thinking, never has an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/scottish-independence\">independent Scotland</a> looked more desirable; to another way of thinking, never has it looked more unviable. Some people \u2013 since 2016, I\u2019ve sometimes been one of them \u2013 manage to hold both opinions: \u201cIt would be a good idea, if only \u2026\u201d But<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/13/the-power-and-the-story-global-battle-news-and-information-review-john-lloyd\"> John Lloyd,</a> a fine journalist with a long career at the Financial Times, has never been among the vacillators. In this book, he argues that Scotland\u2019s secession from the United Kingdom would certainly be damaging for what was left of it \u2013 England, Wales and Northern Ireland, supposing the last still existed \u2013 but nothing less than a disaster for Scotland itself. Economically, socially and culturally, secession would do it more harm than Brexit.</p> <p>The likely economic consequences are hard to deny. Scotland would be launched as a new nation using, as Lloyd says, \u201ca currency (sterling) of a state it has left and over which it has no control, and an application to join a European Union whose rules insist on its adoption of a currency (the euro) the SNP leaders do not wish to join\u201d. Scotland would be separated from its largest export market, which is the rest of the UK, by a hard customs border; there would be no equivalent of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/apr/11/northernireland.northernireland\">the Belfast agreement</a>, an enforceable international treaty, to soften it.</p> <p>The<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/19/what-is-barnett-formula-how-work-scotland-wales-northern-ireland\"> Barnett formula</a> by which the Treasury allots a higher rate of per capita public expenditure in Scotland would go, and with it, by Lloyd\u2019s reckoning, an annual subsidy of between \u00a38bn and \u00a310bn that helps sustain Scotland\u2019s idea of itself as the last British redoubt of the welfare state: free university education, free medical prescriptions and free home care. Oil revenues aren\u2019t what they were, and they never will be again. Most forecasts, including those of the Scottish National Party, predict the need for cuts amounting to as much as a fifth in public spending unless taxes are raised significantly. In the short to medium term, an independent Scotland would inevitably face turbulence and economic decline. Lloyd writes in a memorable sentence that for the SNP\u2019s leaders \u201cthe prospect, for all their public confidence, must be, in reflective moments, terrifying.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae0024971bdf17642ea4d8045650178bb5e6ca4c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae0024971bdf17642ea4d8045650178bb5e6ca4c/0_225_3500_2101/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Alex Salmond outside his home on the day of the Scottish independence referendum, 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alex Salmond outside his home on the day of the Scottish independence referendum, 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And so it must \u2013 as terrifying, in fact, as the economic prospect that should have terrified Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and other members of the Tory groupuscule that has led the UK out of Europe. Just like Brexiters in the European referendum campaign, the most zealous Scottish nationalists write off these dire forecasts as \u201cproject fear\u201d. Forgetting that the original project fear contained warnings that proved well founded (don\u2019t trust in the constancy of oil revenues, for example), they march through Scottish cities turning their streets into a sea of white and blue, demanding a second referendum on independence \u2013 now!</p> <p>The author cuts them no slack. In his view, Scottish nationalism as a popular cause rests on fanciful assumptions of difference and moral superiority. \u201cA confident statement of long-term, deeply embedded difference between the English and the Scots in character, habits, and outlook is rarely possible, though the nationalists attempt to encourage it,\u201d he writes, citing the SNP leadership\u2019s stress on the openness of Scottish society to immigration, compared with the \u201cgrudging, even hostile attitudes\u201d that Scottish nationalists imply are those of the English, when England is the far more multicultural and diverse country. Likewise, the belief that Scotland is inherently more social democratic is hard to justify; the furthest that surveys of social attitudes will go is only that Scotland is \u201csomewhat\u201d more so. As for a greater attachment to European identity, similar surveys show that historically the EU hasn\u2019t excited the Scots any more than the English (more than a third of Scottish votes were for Brexit, after all), though that has changed since 2016. In other words, as the commentator Alex Massie recently wrote, \u201cScotland has more in common with the rest of the United Kingdom, even after Brexit, than it does with anywhere else on Earth.\u201d</p> <p>The SNP\u2019s two most successful leaders, Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon, always recognised this fact and took care to build the secessionist case on different grounds from cultural and social oppression, as summarised in the cry of \u201cFreedom!\u201d that rings out from the Mel Gibson/William Wallace character in <em>Braveheart</em>. Leery \u2013 and lacking the inspirational grievances \u2013 of \u201cheroic\u201d nationalism, they chose better governance and greater prosperity as their objectives, with Scotland imagined in Salmond\u2019s phrase as \u201cthe Saudia Arabia of renewable energy\u201d. Lloyd doubts that this reasoned, civic nationalism is what fuels the popular movement, which now \u201crelies heavily on a distrust, a dislike [of England], most strongly expressed by some of Scotland\u2019s most prominent writers, furthered by the nationalist leadership through a relentless depiction of the British political and governing class as chronically out of touch, London-centred and determined to impoverish Scotland with policies of austerity\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fd383d58e9930c6d9bd459cac3e7f32169c5a4ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd383d58e9930c6d9bd459cac3e7f32169c5a4ec/0_192_2387_1431/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Mel Gibson as William Wallace in Braveheart.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mel Gibson as William Wallace in <em>Braveheart</em>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The writers he has in mind include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/oct/03/theobserver.uknews3\">Tom Nairn</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/05/james-kelman-my-writing-day\">James Kelman</a>, the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/dec/30/alasdair-gray-lanark-sarah-ditum-appreciation\">Alasdair Gray</a>, and the long-dead <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/25/hugh-macdiarmid-robert-burns-scots-vernacular-poetry-auld-lang-syne\">Hugh MacDiarmid</a>. Some prize quotations are summoned. Gray divided English people who came to live in Scotland into two categories: \u201csettlers\u201d, who have the same status as \u201cthe Italians who brought us fish and chips\u201d, and \u201ccolonists\u201d, who can \u201clook forward to a future back in England through promotion or by retirement\u201d. Kelman refused, and refuses, to read English (as opposed to any other country\u2019s) literature on the evidence-free grounds that: \u201cWhy would you want to read things that were treating you as an animal?\u201d Scottish attitudes towards England more generally are difficult to gauge, but if hostility towards it exists as a significant factor in Scottish politics then the tone and personnel of the present Westminster government seem unlikely to bring about any decrease.</p> <p>Which brings us to a paradox. A book that is severely critical of Scottish nationalism becomes kindness itself when it turns to English nationalism. The author berates the SNP on many fronts: that it has never properly engaged with the difficulties that independence will bring; that its social and economic policies post-independence are either vague or absent; that it perpetuates Scotland\u2019s proud but naive idea of itself as a nation of \u201cconfident globalists, well able to fend for themselves in the world\u2019s market place, requiring to be protected from no peoples other than the English\u201d.</p> <p>This is the author as a sceptical, scolding father figure. When he moves south a maternal side emerges, anxious to understand and forgive. The obvious similarities between nationalists north of the border and Brexiters south of it \u2013 their delusions as \u201cconfident globalists\u201d, their need for enemies (London, Brussels), and their economic recklessness \u2013 are never invoked. English nationalism, Lloyd writes, has been characterised as a rightwing endeavour with its psychological origins in English/British exceptionalism and the empire. All wrong. In fact, he says, the blame must go to \u201cthe Englishman\u2019s burden of the three Celtic statelets\u201d, which were never grateful enough to England for their subsidies. While Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland got their devolved assemblies, England continued to be powerless and \u201cenforcibly enfolded\u201d inside Britain and the Union flag. It felt ignored and resentful. By this logic, Scottish nationalism and not the Bruges Group forged the first link in Brexit\u2019s causal chain.</p> <p>He takes on the imperial argument with unusual literalness.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jacob-rees-mogg\"> Jacob Rees-Mogg</a> is described as \u201cin some ways the opposite of an imperialist\u201d because he believes in the free market \u2013 as though this division in 19th-century Britain was anywhere near as clear-cut. Every Rees-Mogg mannerism suggests the word \u201cempire\u201d: his drawling superiority; his idolisation of martial figures such as generals Gordon and Napier (who thought the best way to \u201cquieten\u201d a conquered country was \u201ca good thrashing first and great kindness afterwards\u201d). Lloyd quotes a speech by Rees-Mogg in praise of free trade, but even here the MP for North East Somerset can\u2019t help but sound imperial: \u201cBritain has been called on to be a shaper not only of our destiny but that of the whole world.\u201d And Brexit critics such as Fintan O\u2019Toole (to whom Lloyd takes especial exception) are, after all, not suggesting that Rees-Mogg and his colleagues want to march into Matabeleland with rifle, flag and drum, only that an emotional residue from Britain\u2019s era as the supreme power bloats their view of England\u2019s capability and destiny.</p> <p>Lloyd himself often reaches back to his upbringing in East Fife, in a fishing town that in the 1950s and 60s was far more \u201cScottish\u201d than it is now, though that identity, like most others, has never been a simple thing. His grandfather repaired fishing boats; his mother was a hairdresser; he never knew his English father; his Polish stepfather worked in the mines. He evokes life there more than half-a-century ago with a lively eye for the particular, to show how a distinctive local identity could flourish within a political culture that was unionist and led from London.</p> <p>His book is never better than when it attacks Scottish ideas of English oppression. Where it fails is its refusal to recognise that England has changed \u2013 from a stable and predictable neighbour into a volatile, abrasive and rather friendless country going who-knows-where. Lloyd suggests some form of federalism will hold the UK together, and wants future referendums to stipulate a majority of at least 60% before the status quo can be changed. Good ideas, probably: we know how divisive narrow majorities can be. But where are the federalists? And where is the SNP politician saintly enough to accept this higher bar when the Brexiters now in power were delighted to accept a much lower one? Forces great and small, the pandemic on the one hand and Salmond\u2019s trial on the other, have made the Union\u2019s future anyone\u2019s guess.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Should Auld Acquaintance Be Forgot: The Great Mistake of Scottish Independence is published by Polity (\u00a320).</em></p>",

  "<p>Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s new memoir, which is due to be published on Monday, is a sweeping account of events from his early childhood in Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs to being forced out of the prime ministership in 2018. Given Turnbull\u2019s tumultuous exit from public life, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2019/jul/03/they-never-liked-him-is-scott-morrison-safe-australian-politics-live-podcast\">the history wars that have followed</a>, many readers will be interested in the former prime minister\u2019s reflections on Scott Morrison, the man who replaced him. Here are some of the standout passages from A Bigger Picture.</p> <h2>First meeting</h2> <p>Turnbull says his first encounter with Scott Morrison happened in 2001, when the then-businessman was mulling options to enter politics and Morrison was the state director of the Liberal party. Morrison, Turnbull says, wanted him to be the New South Wales party leader, and \u201chatched an ingenious idea in 2001 that involved a Liberal member of the Legislative Council retiring, my taking up the casual vacancy and then becoming leader of the opposition, running for a seat in the lower house at the next election, due in 2003\u201d. Turnbull wasn\u2019t interested in state politics and was bemused by the unconventional pathway to leadership that Morrison war-gamed with him. He was also concerned Labor would go after him for being wealthy \u2013 \u201can out-of-touch plutocrat\u201d. Morrison apparently had an answer, and spreadsheets, at the ready. \u201cWe\u2019ve been throwing your name into our polling in western Sydney. And you know what? The battlers like you,\u201d Morrison told him. \u201cThey admire your success; they reckon you\u2019re self-made \u2013 it\u2019s all about aspiration. Australians don\u2019t want class wars.\u201d According to this account, Morrison told Turnbull Kerry Chikarovski would make way for him if he signed up to the plan. But the \u201cMalcolm for Macquarie Street\u201d fizzled.</p> <h2>Morrison as a key player in federal Liberal leadership battles against Tony Abbott</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2019/jul/03/they-never-liked-him-is-scott-morrison-safe-australian-politics-live-podcast\">'They never liked him': Niki Savva on why Turnbull was knifed by his own side \u2013 Australian politics live podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Turnbull portrays the current prime minister as always ringside, either in person or through surrogates, during the corrosive leadership battles that erupted shortly after the Coalition came to power in 2013. Turnbull says Morrison began to \u201csniff out interest in removing Abbott\u201d as early as 2014, only a year after the Coalition\u2019s election victory, when the majority of colleagues were not countenancing a change.</p> <p>There was talk of moving Turnbull to Treasury to replace Joe Hockey after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/13/budget-2014-joe-hockey-delivers-deep-pain-for-little-gain\">the disaster of the 2014 budget</a>. \u201cI was careful to play no part in this. Abbott would never move me to treasurer,\u201d Turnbull says. \u201cAnd I felt I was being used as a stalking horse by others, especially Scott Morrison, to position themselves.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2557f924db2af10983ff0bfa120c144e6f0ca03c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2557f924db2af10983ff0bfa120c144e6f0ca03c/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Then immigration minister Scott Morrison listens to then communications minister Malcolm Turnbull during question time in February 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Then immigration minister Scott Morrison listens to then communications minister Malcolm Turnbull during question time in February 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan Porritt/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Turnbull says the agitation persisted, and on 10 December, he had dinner with Morrison, who wanted to replace Abbott as party leader. \u201cIt was the first time he laid out, fairly comprehensively, his thinking on Abbott, who he felt would have to go by the middle of 2015 if his performance didn\u2019t improve. He said Hockey should go now and he was making the case to Abbott to replace him with me. He was closely in touch with the key figures at News [Corp], he told me, and said they were getting ready to dump Abbott. And he made it clear he saw himself as the successor.\u201d</p> <p>After the reshuffle at the end of that year that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/dec/21/tony-abbott-cabinet-reshuffle-moves-scott-morrison-out-of-immigration\">moved Morrison out of immigration and into social services</a>, Turnbull says Morrison was \u201cfurious\u201d and \u201cthis was the first time I recall him saying we will need to remove him before the budget\u201d. By 19 January, Turnbull says Morrison had a list of names who would support tipping Abbott out of the leadership. Morrison wanted the job, \u201cbut didn\u2019t want to be seen to challenge him. He felt the rightwing commentators (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/sep/15/a-painful-morning-for-alan-jones-who-told-malcolm-turnbull-hed-never-be-pm\">by whom he meant Alan Jones</a> and Ray Hadley) would never support me\u201d. Morrison also, according to Turnbull, wanted to marginalise Julie Bishop, but later backed off that idea, and the three later agreed Turnbull would be the leader in the event the campaign to remove Abbott succeeded.</p> <p>Throughout this period, Turnbull notes \u201cMorrison was vocal in his support for Abbott and publicly denied discussing leadership issues with me. Of course, he\u2019d done so on many occasions, and every indication was that he\u2019d encouraged, if not masterminded, the [first] spill itself.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8cfeb1c3d8d79a59a3aa547894fdad06415dfded\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8cfeb1c3d8d79a59a3aa547894fdad06415dfded/0_300_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Abbott addresses the media for the last time as prime minister on 15 September 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Abbott addresses the media for the last time as prime minister on 15 September 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Round two: Morrison\u2019s role in Turnbull losing the prime ministership in 2018</h2> <p>Turnbull\u2019s ire is directly predominantly at Mathias Cormann and Peter Dutton <a href=\"https://meanjin.com.au/essays/prime-minister-disrupted/\">for the coup that terminated his prime ministership in 2018</a>, but he concludes after some equivocation (\u201cit\u2019s never possible to be 100% certain about these things\u201d) that Morrison \u201cwas playing a double game: professing public loyalty to me while at the same time allowing his supporters to undermine me. It was, of course, precisely what he\u2019d done in 2015 when he said he\u2019d voted for Abbott in the leadership ballot but worked closely with me to ensure his supporters voted against Abbott\u201d.</p> <p>Turnbull says he knew on the morning he spilled the leadership, \u201cwhile I was prepared to accept Morrison\u2019s assurances of continued loyalty, I knew that some of his supporters were starting to urge him to make a move himself\u201d. He says he was aware of the risks of tactical voting by Morrison supporters in the first ballot. Turnbull says Morrison sent him a note while the ballots were being distributed. \u201cThe note said: \u2018I don\u2019t know why we didn\u2019t discuss this. But that\u2019s your call. Turnbull is on my ballot.\u2019 I replied, \u2018Thanks! It\u2019s the right call. The room has to make up its mind.\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Scott is a control freak and I\u2019d seen before ... how he\u2019d publicly vote one way while ensuring his supporters voted the other way</p> <footer> <cite>Malcolm Turnbull</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When the result <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/aug/21/malcolm-turnbull-survives-leadership-contest-peter-dutton\">was 48 votes for Turnbull and 35 for Dutton</a>, \u201cI wondered whether some of Morrison\u2019s supporters had taken the chance and voted for Dutton, hoping they didn\u2019t accidentally deliver him a win. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/01/duttons-keystone-cops-and-morrisons-prayer-five-key-moments-from-niki-savvas-book\">Subsequent accounts of these events</a> indicate that Stuart Robert and Alex Hawke had organised about half-a-dozen of them to vote for Dutton \u2013 enough to lift his numbers up to a level that damaged me but didn\u2019t get Dutton over the line. If Morrison\u2019s friends had voted the way he said he did, the Dutton insurgency would have been utterly dead that morning.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea that they did that without his knowledge is fanciful. Scott is a control freak and I\u2019d seen before in the ballots in 2015 how he\u2019d publicly vote one way while ensuring his supporters voted the other way.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Love you mate\u2019</h2> <p>When it was clear he had no prospects of retaining the prime ministership, Turnbull actively encouraged Morrison\u2019s campaign. Turnbull says he lined up behind Morrison because he believed he was \u201ca responsible, safe pair of hands. But Dutton, were he to become prime minister, would run off to the right with a divisive, dog-whistling, anti-immigration agenda, written and directed by Sky News and 2GB, designed to throw red meat to the base. With no constraints, Dutton would do enormous damage to the social fabric of Australia. It\u2019s one thing having the tough cop handling border protection and counter-terrorism, but not at the head of our multicultural society\u201d.</p> <p>Turnbull also records the messages he exchanged with his successor after Morrison <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2018/aug/24/liberal-spill-malcolm-turnbull-peter-dutton-scott-morrison-liberal-spill-politics-parliament-live?page=with:block-5b7fc123e4b0b69fd6c5528e\">was sworn in</a>. \u201cI messaged him,\u201d Turnbull says, \u201cCongratulations prime minister and good luck.\u201d According to Turnbull, Morrison replied the next morning. \u201cOnly you can know how I feel today, but I cannot begin to know how you feel. I loved working for and with you. I\u2019m really proud of what we did. And that is always how I will always feel and speak of it. I want you to know I am thinking about you a great deal and you know I pray for you. That doesn\u2019t change now. I don\u2019t know why all this happened, but now it has come upon me, you know I will be relying on my faith, friends and values to overcome and conquer what is ahead \u2026 Thank you for all you\u2019ve done for me. But above all as one PM to another, thank you for everything you did for our country. No one knows that contribution better than me.</p> <p>\u201cLove you mate.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b25e2e31490e71399234db24461d78873147a780\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b25e2e31490e71399234db24461d78873147a780/0_55_3454_2073/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scott Morrison pledges his loyalty to then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull at a press conference in the PM\u2019s courtyard on 22 August 2018, two days before he took the leadership.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scott Morrison pledges his loyalty to then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull at a press conference in the PM\u2019s courtyard on 22 August 2018, two days before he took the leadership.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Morrison\u2019s negative views on marriage equality</h2> <p>Turnbull notes at one point in the memoir that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/22/same-sex-marriage-plebiscite-scott-morrison-says-he-faces-bigotry-too\">working to prevent the legalisation of same-sex marriage</a> was the most animated Morrison ever got during internal policy debates. Morrison, Turnbull says, wanted a constitutional amendment on the question. \u201cScott explained to me a few days later, \u2018I don\u2019t want gay marriage. And because referendums are almost always defeated, I think that\u2019s a good way to ensure it never happens.\u201d Morrison also ran interference on the issue. In the 2016 election, Turnbull says the issue of marriage equality was broadly neutralised until \u201cthis equilibrium was thrown out in the last crucial week of the campaign by Scott Morrison, who had been the principal advocate of a plebiscite\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cDuring an interview with Leigh Sales on 7.30 on Tuesday 28 June, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/29/scott-morrison-and-julie-bishop-will-not-confirm-they-will-vote-for-marriage-equality\">refused to say how he\u2019d vote if the plebiscite was carried</a> and this immediately raised concerns about the government\u2019s sincerity. Scott had a very sincerely held and viscerally intense opposition to same-sex marriage and could have said he\u2019d abstain, but I fear his troubled conscience was reserving the right to vote against it. Every other minister was then asked how they\u2019d vote; most sensibly said they\u2019d vote for legalisation if the plebiscite passed. A cautious answer from Julie Bishop was unreasonably portrayed as equivocal. She was a strong supporter of same-sex marriage despite a ferocious anti-same-sex-marriage element in her constituency, led by Margaret Court.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018We\u2019ve got a treasurer problem\u2019</h2> <p>Turnbull recounts a number of instances in the memoir where he asserts Morrison was either leaking government discussions or front-running issues with trusted media surrogates during internal debates about tax reform and about budget measures. Turnbull says he had several \u201ctough discussions\u201d with Morrison about his behaviour. He says both he and the finance minister Mathias Cormann were \u201cat our wits\u2019 end as to how to manage Scott\u201d. He says Cormann said the government had \u201ca treasurer problem\u201d. In an exchange of messages between the two Turnbull says he replied: \u201c[Morrison] operates completely differently from us. We prefer to stay absolutely resolute on course until we decide to change. He wants to flag possible changes way in advance (why?) which reduces optionality and makes us look undecided. I can\u2019t work it out because it\u2019s so counter productive.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>[Scott Morrison] was brittle emotionally and easily offended.</p> <footer> <cite>Malcolm Turnbull</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cNothing is more corrosive of good government than policy consideration being front-run in the media,\u201d Turnbull says. \u201cI found it completely incomprehensible and couldn\u2019t see how anyone\u2019s interest or agenda was assisted. Scott adamantly denied any responsibility, but regrettably nobody believed him.</p> <p>\u201cI had no problem whatsoever with Scott\u2019s political pragmatism \u2013 he was, after all, a former state director of the party and looked at issues almost exclusively through a political prism. But working with him was difficult; so much of what we discussed or were thinking about found its way into the media.</p> <p>\u201cMany of my colleagues encouraged me, without success, to mistrust Scott and to see his briefings as malign, the calculated undermining and manoeuvring of a Machiavellian plotter. And yet we enjoyed a close working relationship. Despite Mathias\u2019s begging me to be selective in what I told him, I continued to be open with Scott. He seemed to me to be my most likely successor, and as far as I could I preferred to work with him as a trusted partner. Scott, like many politicians, wanted to keep himself constantly in the centre of things. That was the purpose, Mathias maintained, of Scott\u2019s constant stream of briefings, mostly to Simon Benson at News Corporation.\u201d</p> <h2>We have to make sure Scott is a success</h2> <p>Some of the more scathing commentary Turnbull makes about his successor is delivered through passing references to the prime minister. \u201cMathias and I agreed we had to make sure Scott was a success.</p> <p>\u201cWe had to recognise he was brittle emotionally and easily offended. At a practical level we both sought to ensure, as tactfully as possible, that he stayed out of negotiations with the Senate. He had a blustering manner that could easily be mistaken for bullying and was often counterproductive.\u201d</p> <h2>Relationships between Morrison, Dutton and Cormann</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2bd1a8933bfae54d80de5d52d37a79e5a3ed2047\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bd1a8933bfae54d80de5d52d37a79e5a3ed2047/0_0_4456_2971/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mathias Cormann (left) and Peter Dutton emerge from the Liberal party room meeting on 24 August 2018, the day Scott Morrison was sworn in as Australia\u2019s 30th prime minister.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mathias Cormann and Peter Dutton emerge from the Liberal party room meeting on 24 August 2018, the day Scott Morrison was sworn in as Australia\u2019s 30th prime minister.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It should be clear from the preceding references that Turnbull narrates a hostile relationship between Cormann, the finance minister, and Morrison, then treasurer. Turnbull suggests that Cormann\u2019s strong support of Dutton during the leadership crisis in 2018 reflected two things \u2013 a close personal relationship between the two rightwingers, and Cormann\u2019s fixed dislike of Morrison.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Mathias regarded Scott as emotional, narcissistic and untrustworthy and told me so regularly.</p> <footer> <cite>Malcolm Turnbull</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cMathias regarded Scott as emotional, narcissistic and untrustworthy and told me so regularly,\u201d Turnbull says.</p> <p>Turnbull says Dutton was also hostile to Morrison. \u201cOf course, if Mathias had a poor opinion of Scott, Dutton\u2019s dislike of him was even stronger,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Turnbull suggests the feelings were more or less mutual. Morrison for his part \u201cdidn\u2019t entirely trust Mathias, not because he saw Mathias as a rival for the leadership one day, but because he knew Mathias was close to Peter Dutton. Scott didn\u2019t trust Dutton at all and regarded him as deficient in all respects \u2013 character, intellect and political nous.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWithin that troika,\u201d Turnbull says, \u201cit would be fair to say that each of them trusted me more than they trusted the other.\u201d</p> <p>Cormann\u2019s move against Turnbull clearly stung the most. Turnbull says he was \u201churt\u201d personally by the finance minister\u2019s decision to agitate on behalf of Dutton, because he thought there was a friendship that eclipsed the transactions of politics. Although he also quotes Cormann describing the move against him by Dutton as \u201cmadness, and it is terrorism \u2013 but you have to give in to it\u201d.</p> <p><em>\u2022 A Bigger Picture by Malcolm Turnbull <a href=\"https://www.hardiegrant.com/au/books/events-calendar/malcolm-turnbull-readings\">is published by Hardie Grant Books</a> (RRP $55).
