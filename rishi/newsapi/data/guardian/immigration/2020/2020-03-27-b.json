  "<h2><strong>How to keep your hair in check \u2013 Sali Hughes</strong></h2> <p>Social media is awash with professional colourists pleading with absent clients not to reach for the box dye while they\u2019re closed for business. This is partly because, like every service profession, hairdressing will take a financial beating during this crisis.</p> <p>But professionals are also genuinely worried about their clients\u2019 hair, and tell me they\u2019re bracing themselves for a plethora of complex colour correction appointments when they finally reopen. \u201cColour correction can be a long, drawn-out and expensive process,\u201d warns Luke Hersheson, my own stylist and creative director of Hershesons in London. \u201cUntil we know when salons might reopen, it\u2019s much safer to use a temporary fix, like a root touch-up spray or powder that shampoos out,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He believes many women can buy a few more weeks by just changing where they part their hair. There\u2019s usually more grey at the temples, so a centre parting is a good stopgap.</p> <p>Top salon colourist Josh Wood isn\u2019t against box dyes \u2013 he even sells them under the Josh Wood Colour brand in Boots. However, the secret to a successful home dye job, he says, is in knowing your limitations. \u201cNow is not the time to transform the colour of your hair, or for tricky techniques like balayage, ombre or bleaching,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"20c824ef510e89cf8af1d39d3ff5a450aecd6aff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20c824ef510e89cf8af1d39d3ff5a450aecd6aff/0_34_1238_1732/715.jpg\" alt=\"Try a root disguiser to touch up your hair colour, Sali Hughes suggests.\" width=\"715\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Try a root disguiser to touch up your hair colour, Sali Hughes suggests.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rui Faria/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Retouching roots or toning existing colour should be the extent of your ambition as an amateur. Wood suggests applying a moisturising hair mask a couple of days before colouring, and \u201calways choosing dye in one shade lighter than you think you need from the picture\u201d, as too dark is impossible to correct. Follow the box instructions to the letter, Wood says, \u201cstarting at the greyest point \u2013 usually the front \u2013 and cover roots for twice the length of time as the lengths\u201d. He suggests enlisting your spouse or teen to do the back.</p> <p>In any case, you must always, always do a skin test in advance, according to instructions, to minimise the risk of potentially serious allergic reaction. It can be a lifesaver.</p> <p>Hersheson (whose team, like Wood\u2019s, is offering video consultations during the crisis) points out that it\u2019s worth considering whether social isolation might be a good opportunity to push through the pain barrier of transitioning to grey. \u201cIt\u2019s also a good time to grow out an unwanted fringe \u2013 you can clip it back and not worry about how that looks, and not have the stress of trimming it yourself,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Hersheson counsels against trimming your fringe, unless you\u2019re very adept. But I have trimmed dozens of fringes in extremis, and if you think you\u2019re up to the job, here\u2019s my own technique:</p> <ul> <li><p>Always start with clean, but dry hair \u2013 never, ever cut when wet or even damp. Clip back the rest of your hair, leaving the dry fringe isolated and loose.</p></li> <li><p>Comb through, and with the comb, gather the entire fringe into a single, flat, one-inch section at the very centre of your forehead.</p></li> <li><p>Clamp it between two flat fingers at the bottom of the section, approximately 1cm from the hair tips (use a plastic freezer bag clip instead, if you prefer).</p></li> <li><p>Take the sharpest scissors you own and cut up into the one-inch section of tips, naturally stopping at the fingers. Do not cut across, only upwards. When you\u2019ve snipped the entire inch-wide section, release your fingers and comb through to assess the length, snipping away any single hairs you may have missed.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>If it\u2019s still too long (always preferable to too short), repeat the process, nudging fingers up only half a centimetre at a time, before combing through and checking. </p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>How to socialise online \u2013 Elle Hunt</strong></h2> <p>Not only is it eminently possible to maintain your friendships under lockdown, talking to people other than those you live and work with is highly advisable if you are to emerge with your sanity intact. Our social lives\u2019 pivot to video just means a bit more planning.</p> <p>If it\u2019s a large group you are trying to meet with, you can gauge everyone\u2019s availability using the easy web scheduling tool <a href=\"http://www.doodle.com/create\">Doodle</a>.</p> <p>The best platform to use is probably the one the majority of people already have an account with. If everyone is using an iPhone or Apple computer, use FaceTime. WhatsApp permits video calls with up to four participants but, without calling on WhatsApp Web, ties you to your phone.</p> <p>For many, Skype is a tried and trusted classic that supports up to 50 participants \u2013 though rarely seamlessly. Otherwise, most people have a Google account, making <a href=\"http://hangouts.google.com/\">Hangouts</a> a straightforward choice.</p> <p>The video conferencing platform Zoom, which has <a href=\"https://www.ig.com/uk/news-and-trade-ideas/how-high-can-the-zoom-share-price-possibly-go--200324\">seen its shares spike since the coronavirus outbreak</a>, limits free group calls to 40 minutes \u2013 but you can always call back.</p> <p>No matter the platform , some lagging audio and frozen faces are inevitable, especially for large groups. Adding some structure \u2013 such as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/26/the-perfect-time-to-start-how-book-clubs-are-enduring-and-flourishing-during-covid-19\">book club</a>, quiz or a table-top role-playing game such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/nov/29/gamers-back-under-dungeons-and-dragons-spell\">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> can be helpful in adjusting to an unfamiliar medium and minimising people talking over each other.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84dbfdb781d3ff9d039a863b9ba91d460ac9b89c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84dbfdb781d3ff9d039a863b9ba91d460ac9b89c/0_0_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Houseparty app \u2013 a conversation with eight people.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Houseparty app \u2013 a conversation with eight people.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: houseparty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The <a href=\"https://houseparty.com/\">Houseparty app</a> might be geared more towards younger groups, having been a fad among kids a few years ago. But now it seems to be a royal platform of choice. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing, I just press a button and all my family pop up,\u201d the Duchess of Cornwall <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8157795/Duchess-Cornwall-chats-family-video-app.html\">reportedly told a friend</a>. The app can alert you when your friends are online, allowing you to effectively drop in on them. It also has in-built games, for up to eight players at a time.</p> <p>Some people have ramped up, or perhaps rediscovered, their love of gaming as a means of socialising at a distance, with popular games such as Minecraft, Fortnite and Call of Duty all allowing some in-play communication. It is also possible to play board games online, such as at <a href=\"https://en.boardgamearena.com/\">Board Game Arena</a> and \u2013 for the more hardcore \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.tabletopsimulator.com/\">Tabletop Simulator</a>.</p> <p>For a more relaxed interaction \u2013 and one that does not demand that you broadcast your face \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.netflixparty.com/\">Netflix Party</a> is a Google Chrome extension that permits you to sync your streaming with friends, like a remote movie night.</p> <h2><strong>How to work from home \u2013 Elle Hunt</strong></h2> <p>Every longtime freelancer knows the secret to effective working from home: put your shoes on. It\u2019s really effective in cueing the mindset shift from \u201chome is where the couch is\u201d to \u201cproductivity ninja\u201d.</p> <p>The goal is to create a distinction, even one that is mostly symbolic, between work mode and home mode, \u2013 especially now that you cannot go anywhere else. Setting up a home office, if only a dedicated corner of your kitchen table, that you can arrive at and leave at the day\u2019s end will help (do make sure you leave).</p> <p>Your new colleagues may also take some adjusting-to. Novelist Julie Cohen<a href=\"https://twitter.com/julie_cohen/status/1243129181174669312\"> shared on Twitter</a> her top tip for working around family, care of her marriage counsellor: a literal work hat. \u201cTrain everyone (and yourself) that when you\u2019re wearing The Work Hat, they should leave you alone. (And when you\u2019re wearing it, you should only work),\u201d she tweeted. It will be a talking point on all those video-conferencing calls, too.</p> <p>Be aware that whatever is visible behind you on your webcam will be under close scrutiny from your colleagues, and inform their judgments of your home, taste and private life. Style accordingly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a93ef64cabd335d1ebda91d7947a3f5f5f719653\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a93ef64cabd335d1ebda91d7947a3f5f5f719653/0_711_7216_4330/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Can you recreate the coffee-shop ambience to work at home?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Can you recreate the coffee-shop ambience when working at home?

With the sound of teaspoons tinkling on saucers and hissing espresso machines over gentle indie music, you won\u2019t believe it\u2019s not Starbucks.</p> <p>You can even fudge together your own overly sweet frappuccino concoction. On the video platform Tik Tok, enterprising teenagers <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/03/9581785/dalgona-coffee-recipe-tiktok-trend\">have been filming themselves</a> making \u201cdalgona\u201d coffee to replicate cafe coffee at home. It is easy to make, if high in caffeine and wasteful of milk: mix equal parts instant coffee, boiling water and sugar \u2013 about two tbsp per person \u2013 and whisk. Add more sugar to taste. Once the mixture is stiff and glossy, pour over milk and ice, stir and serve. And whisk it by hand, even if you have an electric maker.

Swap it over after a fortnight, though, as there\u2019s evidence that you build fitness faster when you do things you\u2019re inept at.</p> <p>Just because there\u2019s no professional asking you whether you have any injuries does not mean you can ignore your injuries.

  "<p>Sport has always been more than a game to Craig Foster. Digest any of his musings on football, and Foster\u2019s view of sport as a vehicle to effect change, break down boundaries and bring people together is palpable.</p> <p>The former Socceroo and SBS presenter is also a dab hand at making things happen. Foster was the driving force behind the release last year of Hakeem al-Araibi, the Bahraini footballer detained in Thailand, and has recently campaigned on behalf of asylum seekers stranded on Nauru and Papua New Guinea.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2020/mar/27/david-squires-on-the-absence-of-the-a-league-for-the-foreseeable-future\">David Squires on ... the absence of the A-League for the foreseeable future</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now, Covid-19 is in his crosshairs. As politicians grapple with the social and economic carnage caused by the global health crisis, Foster is calling on sport in Australia, now that there is no sport, to unite and pitch in during this extraordinary time of need.</p> <p>\u201cSport is closed down across the country. That is a trauma for many people in itself. But broader society is hurting, we\u2019re all hurting together,\u201d Foster tells Guardian Australia. \u201cOne of the best ways for sport to recover from all this is to connect to each other and to the broader Australian community. Sporting clubs are important social connectors.\u201d</p> <p>Foster is calling on the multitudes connected with community sport in Australia to redeploy their volunteering efforts and play not for points this season, but for lives. It\u2019s a grand concept. And if it sounds like a movement, that\u2019s because it is: the <a href=\"www.playforlives.org\">#PlayForLives</a> movement.</p> <p>\u201cNow that sport is being closed own, we have participants who were training and competing for four to five hours per week,\u201d Foster says. \u201cWe\u2019re asking all of sport to step up and apply that to not only their own community but to the rest of Australia. What\u2019s occurred at community level is that many of the social service delivery agencies, who are making meals, delivering hot meals, driving people around, their funding has dried up and many of them have had to close the doors. The load on those that are still existing has expanded exponentially.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to put sport at the service of the Australian community. Sport has a number of values which are really important: teamwork, solidarity and endurance. The need for volunteering in the last couple of weeks has become more acute than ever. We\u2019re asking all participants who were going to play to put themselves forward to volunteer in some way.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Craig_Foster/status/1242659664359092225\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PlayForLives?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#PlayForLives</a> <br><br>Sport\u2019s role now is not to play for points, but lives<br><br>We can no longer play onfield &amp; are putting ourselves at the service of essential services<br><br>Football clubs are volunteering for community organisations &amp; charities including Adam &amp; I<br><br>Get in touch\ud83d\udc47<a href=\"https://twitter.com/WOBFC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@WOBFC</a> \u2764\ufe0f <a href=\"https://t.co/R67p5l7cXY\">pic.twitter.com/R67p5l7cXY</a></p>&mdash; Craig Foster (@Craig_Foster) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Craig_Foster/status/1242659664359092225?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 25, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Such a call to arms might seem precarious at a time when human movement is governed by social distancing and lockdowns. But Foster envisages a broad spectrum of assistance.</p> <p>\u201cThere are millions of ways we can help. If we create a sporting coalition for humanity, a sporting volunteer workforce, people can add their own professional skills. People are working from home now. The time they would\u2019ve been training and playing they can now use to apply their professional skills as a designer, a lawyer, an IT expert.</p> <p>\u201cSafety is the absolute priority for everyone right now. Nevertheless, the need for people to physically go and help pack boxes, to drive cancer patients to hospital, to drive trucks, to deliver food to refugees and vulnerable families is chronic.</p> <p>\u201cFor some it will be volunteering in community and taking every precaution under government guidelines, for others it might be from home in a digital sense. That\u2019s a matter for the non-government organisations. Red Cross will be interested in delivering digital messaging campaigns, whereas Foodbank and Meals On Wheels will need us packing boxes to get to families that night. There\u2019s a triad of sport, government and NGOs that need to work together right now.\u201d</p> <p>What started out as a good idea that Foster floated to his Waverley Old Boys Over 35s teammates has taken off, with a variety of sporting bodies and public figures pledging their commitment to #PlayForLives.</p> <p>\u201cFootball has responded beautifully. There is a tremendous amount of desire within the game to step forward. I\u2019m expecting that FFA [Football Federation Australia] will be getting involved in the near term. But this need is far too great. One sport can\u2019t cover it,\u201d he says. To that end Foster has succeeded in getting the NSWRL on board, with Brad Fittler and Ben Elias to serve in ambassadorial roles. Foster says discussions with Rugby Australia and the AFL are progressing well, while Liz Ellis has picked up the ball on behalf of the netball community.</p> <p>\u201cWe need both levels of sport involved. We need national level for scale and we need grassroots community for connectedness, for relationships, for personal support. A top-down approach is great because we can scale really quickly and get a lot of information to a lot of people. Equally, the grassroots clubs need to take ownership of this because they\u2019re the ones who will be in the community.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/25/australian-olympic-sports-face-up-to-uncertain-new-reality\">Australian Olympic sports face up to uncertain new reality | Kieran Pender</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many people Foster is asking for help will be experiencing their own struggles as the coronavirus outbreak bites industry and forces chunks of the workforce onto reduced hours or out of work altogether.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got historic levels of job losses, people on the bread line who don\u2019t know where their next meal is coming from.

  "<p>Australia is facing an unprecedented crisis and our main act of social responsibility right now is to practise physical distancing, which can feel passive. Where we might have usually put our hands up to lend a hand, or taken to the streets in protest , we\u2019re now finding ourselves at home, sometimes alone. But there are still ways to give our time, money or support to others. We\u2019re home but we\u2019re not helpless.</p> \n<p>\u201cAccording to the <a href=\"https://www.cafonline.org/about-us/publications/2019-publications/caf-world-giving-index-10th-edition\">World Giving Index</a>, which looks at 10 years of data, Australia is the fourth most generous country in the world. One of the challenges we\u2019ve got is that charities are going to face some really tough times in the months ahead,\u201d says Krystian Seibert, philanthropy and giving expert at Swinburne University of Technology. </p> \n<p>So how can we help? \u201cThe current crisis has two levels to it: one is at a community level, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/17/people-need-to-be-supportive-finding-community-online-in-the-coronavirus-crisis\">donating toilet rolls</a>, for example, and the other is through charities,\u201d Seibert says. \u201cMany Australians are going to be under financial pressure so it may affect their ability to donate money. What you can do is identify a charity either because it\u2019s been impacted by the crisis, or a charity that has had increased demand.\u201d Donate money if you can. If you can\u2019t, here are eight more ways you can support others right now.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for <em>Coronavirus: Australia at a glance</em>, our daily email newsletter</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Be a voice of comfort</strong></h2> \n<p>Another insight from the World Giving Index is that 64% of Australians said they\u2019d help a stranger \u2013 and we\u2019re seeing more people reaching out beyond their homes to help others. You can <a href=\"http://volunteering.redcross.org.au/cw/en/job/495952?lApplicationSubSourceID=\">register your interest to volunteer with Australian Red Cross</a>, which is still supporting those recovering from the bushfires as well as those impacted by Covid-19. Once registered, the <a href=\"volunteering.redcross.org.au\">Red Cross</a> will match your interest with locations where help is needed. Remote volunteering includes wellbeing checks on those in isolation.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c8e9d6e6-5d2f-4e65-a56a-e9076507df09\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wIguWQIsyaE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Take a neighbour\u2019s dog for a stroll</strong></h2> \n<p>A Sydney resident, Lisa Hollinshead, set up a community network called One Another while she was stranded in Spain with her 89-year-old grandmother during the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak. <a href=\"www.oneanother.community\">One Another</a> volunteers can offer services like walking a neighbour\u2019s dog, picking up groceries and being on the end of the line for someone who\u2019s lonely. \u201cIt\u2019s a place where people can ask for help,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople can register their details and nominate people who need help or nominate themselves. Being a single mum and having to isolate for two weeks is a reality that I am facing too. It\u2019s a platform for single mums, for people who have asthma, and people who are generally finding it tough.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Donate blood</strong></h2> \n<p>Our biggest social responsibility is to stay home, but there are vital services that still need our help in person. Lifeblood\u2019s chief executive, Shelly Park, is calling for healthy donors to continue making generous donations of blood and plasma. Blood donor centres are open and blood is needed for transfusions, cancer patients, car accidents and to replace blood lost during birth. Check your eligibility in this <a href=\"https://www.donateblood.com.au/eligibility#can-i-give-blood\">online tool</a>. Donation centres are also undergoing <a href=\"https://www.donateblood.com.au/page/coronavirus-update\">further sanitation protocols</a>, including social distancing, restricting non-donating visitors and introducing a 28-day donation postponement for any donors returning from overseas.</p> \n<h2><strong>Adopt a healthcare worker</strong></h2> \n<p>Another vital out-of-home service is healthcare \u2013 but you don\u2019t need to step a foot out of the door to help out. Thanks to a Perth resident, Chris Nicholas, who set up a Facebook community called <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/666739964088379/\">Adopt a Healthcare Worker</a>, you can connect with a healthcare worker in your local area. The Western Australia page now has 43,000 members and there is a separate page for every state and territory, as well as pages for Canada, New Zealand, the US and the UK. It\u2019s not a space for medical advice, memes or politics, say the page\u2019s admins (a team of 59 people around the world).</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the interactions go from let\u2019s bake things or take coffee to people organising share-houses, for example, if a healthcare worker is living with someone who is in a high-risk category,\u201d says Nicholas, who is now in isolation. \u201cI think it\u2019s resonated with people because everyday people can get behind it. We don\u2019t organise anything, we connect people\u201d. Don\u2019t want to commit to adoption? You can also buy a healthcare professional a coffee by donating to this <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/buy-them-a-coffee\">Go Fund Me campaign</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> \n <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-I3SPRALzY/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

  "<p>Councils have been given 48 hours to find emergency accommodation for all rough sleepers in England following an unprecedented, but unfunded, request from the government that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/ministers-asking-english-councils-to-house-all-rough-sleepers-says-charity\">all homeless people should be housed by Sunday.</a></p> \n<p>Council officials welcomed the urgency of the request but expressed concern about the difficulty of the task, given the already acute accommodation shortages. These shortages worsened this week after a parallel government instruction to hotels to close. The Local Government Association (LGA) said councils <a href=\"https://www.local.gov.uk/coronavirus-lga-responds-government-rough-sleeping-announcement\">would need extra funding</a> if they were to meet the deadline.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/27/police-acknowledge-confusion-over-uk-lockdown-rules\">Police acknowledge confusion over UK lockdown rules</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cThese are unusual times, so I\u2019m asking for an unusual effort,\u201d an email from Louise Casey, who was appointed last week to lead the government\u2019s response to Covid-19 and rough sleeping, read. \u201cAs you know, this is a public health emergency.\u201d Casey, who also worked as Tony Blair\u2019s homelessness tsar, said it was vital that night shelters and all street encampments be closed down, to stop the spread of the disease.</p> \n<p>Later Luke Hall, the junior housing minister, wrote a <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/876466/Letter_from_Minister_Hall_to_Local_Authorities.pdf\">letter</a> to the leader of every local authority in England asking them to house all people sleeping rough and to find alternative accommodation for people in hostels and night shelters by the end of the weekend, in order to prevent the spread of coronavirus.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is now imperative that rough sleepers and other vulnerable homeless are supported into appropriate accommodation by the end of the week,\u201d he wrote. He went on to instruct each local authority to set up a Covid-19 rough sleeping \u201ccoordination cell\u201d and highlighted the importance of stopping homeless people from congregating in day-centre facilities to reduce the risk of transmission. There was no new funding for this request, but Hall referred council leaders to an earlier announcement of \u00a31.6bn for local authorities\u2019 Covid-19 response.</p> \n<p>In a significant departure from normal rules, he also stressed that people classified as having \u201cno recourse to public funds\u201d (a status given to people who are seeking asylum, or who have a limited immigration status), who normally have no right to housing support or benefits, should also be helped with emergency accommodation. But it was not clear how councils would fund this provision. The letter simply instructed them to \u201cutilise alternative powers and funding to assist those with no recourse to public funds who require shelter and other forms of support due to the Covid-19 pandemic\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/cumulative\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>James Jamieson, chairman of the LGA, said councils were already working hard to protect rough sleepers from becoming sick by getting them into accommodation. \u201cTo help these efforts, some councils will need to call on the government for urgent help to find accommodation and enforce this and have access to funding if they need to cover staffing and support costs,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Jon Sparkes, chief executive of the homelessness charity Crisis, welcomed the government\u2019s request, but also questioned how councils would fund the exercise. \u201cThe government\u2019s insistence that everyone sleeping rough should be housed by the weekend is a landmark moment \u2013 and the right thing to do,\u201d he said. \u201cQuestions remain about how local councils will be supported to do this, and whether additional funding, or assistance securing hotel rooms, will be made available. We also need to see a package of support so that, when the outbreak subsides, the outcome is not that people return to the streets.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said the government should now make a national appeal for empty accommodation, such as apartment blocks and hotels, to be handed over to councils so that homeless people can be accommodated.</p> \n<p>Rough sleepers at Heathrow airport were told to move out on Thursday. Paul Atherton, a filmmaker who has been homeless for a number of years and who this week has been sleeping at Terminal 5, said dozens of homeless people had been told to move on, without clear instructions about where to go. He had not received assistance from Westminster council in getting housing on Friday and was pessimistic about the prospect of being accommodated. \u201cThe likelihood of anyone being housed before the weekend is infinitesimally small,\u201d he said, suggesting that the government\u2019s request would have been more powerful if it had ordered local councils to comply.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7a6078f6-5a66-4d3e-9339-5610fe320767\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.</p>\n    <p>The UN agency&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public\">advises</a>&nbsp;people to:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Frequently wash their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or warm water and soap</li>\n     <li>Cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when sneezing or coughing</li>\n     <li>Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever or cough</li>\n     <li>Seek early medical help if they have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and share their travel history with healthcare providers</li>\n     <li>Advice about face masks varies.

She said the task had been made more complicated by the closure of hotels that housed people in temporary accommodation and the difficulty in getting all rough sleepers to agree to go into housing. \u201cWe won\u2019t be scooping people off the streets unless the government tells us to.

This is a matter of public health as well as care for individuals,\u201d the CEO, Sally Daghlian, said.</p> \n<p>Jessie Seal, of Naccom, an organisation that last year helped accommodate 1,300 destitute migrants, said she was concerned by the lack of clarity over who was to fund housing people who have no recourse to public funds. \u201cIt is clear that local authorities need additional funding to support people with no recourse to public funds, and the Home Office must make policy-level changes to enable this. Without change from the Home Office, people will continue to be turned away from homelessness support services on the ground,\u201d she said.</p>",

For other admissions into hospitals with those conditions, we test routinely. Also in some other specific areas where people are at high risk, like care homes.</p> \n  <p>The basis for this is you must have clinical symptoms. The default is that without this you would not be tested. The only other factor would be the centrality of your role in the Covid-19 response. The prime minister plays a very critical role in that and that is the basis for our testing.</p> \n  <p><strong>Stevens</strong> says it is urgently important to test frontline staff who are off sick or are self-isolating. The number of tests carried out will be doubled by the end of next week compared to this week. </p> \n  <p>We will be rolling out staff testing across the NHS, starting next week with critical care nurses and other staff in intensive care, emergency departments, ambulance services, GPs; and as the testing volumes continue to increase we want to expand that to a range of essential public workers, including those in our social care services and continuing with the patient testing.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-27T17:57:41.884Z\">at 5.57pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7e34ac8f08af215f6fcaad\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-27T17:24:22.035Z\">5.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">'The virus does not discriminate, we are all at risk,' says Gove</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Q: <em>The prime minister and health secretary have coronavirus and the chief medical officer is in isolation.

We are all at risk and that is why it is so important that we all practise social distancing measures. </p> \n  <p><strong>Stevens</strong> says NHS England wants urgent cancer treatments to continue but specialists should have the opportunity to decide whether it is more risky to embark on treatment at this particular time given that you are more vulnerable to infection if you begin a course of treatment and become immuno-compromised as a result. Those are clinical decisions to be taken.</p> \n  <p>We have also reached an agreement with independent hospitals that cancer care can take place there rather than at the busy hospitals treating coronavirus patients, he says. </p> \n  <p><strong>Harries</strong> says it would be foolish to predict when the peak is expected as we are yet to see how effective physical distancing measures have been.

  "<p>Until a couple of weeks ago, the idea of waiting in an Ocado queue of 73,735 shoppers, or of supermarkets rationing milk and baked beans, would have sounded like satire. For too many people in the UK, food scarcity is the norm, with mothers and fathers going hungry to ensure their children are fed. But others have grown used to an absurd abundance: strawberries and peaches in midwinter, or 20 types of mustard alongside three score of pasta. When such bounty overflows, it seems self-evident that supplies are both plentiful and reliable \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/millions-to-need-food-aid-in-days-as-virus-exposes-uk-supply\" title=\"\">until suddenly they aren\u2019t</a>.</p> <p>In fact, warns Tim Lang in his new book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/22/tim-lang-interview-professor-of-food-policy-city-university-supply-chain-crisis\" title=\"\">Feeding Britain</a>, our food system is \u201cstretched, open to disruption and far from resilient\u201d. It is easy to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/21/coronavirus-uk-panic-buyers-urged-to-think-of-frontline-workers\" title=\"\">castigate panic buyers</a> for empty shelves. But while shopping responsibly will help others to get the food they need, only a few people are squirrelling away vast stocks. Research firm Kantar says the average spend per supermarket trip has risen by 16% to \u00a322.13 month on month \u2013 not surprising when households realised they were likely to need lunches at home, including for children no longer in school, and could have to self-isolate for a fortnight.</p> <p>The underlying problem is that just-in-time supply chains can struggle to cope with even relatively small shifts, and that a handful of retailers dominate the market. The top eight account for <a href=\"https://www.kantarworldpanel.com/grocery-market-share/great-britain\" title=\"\">more than 90% of all grocery sales</a> in Britain, with Tesco alone accounting for 27%. The efficiencies that have kept food prices low, and the long and complex global chains that bring us such variety, come at a price.</p> <p>Border closures due to the virus as well as sickness could yet hit agriculture and delivery. Farmers say they face <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/25/uk-farmers-fear-huge-labour-shortfall-despite-interest-in-land-army\" title=\"\">huge labour shortages</a>, though Britain, France and others are discussing new \u201cland armies\u201d to bring in crops normally harvested by migrant workers. Some countries are imposing limits on exports of staples to ensure they can feed their own populations. Only half the food we consume in Britain is produced here.</p> <p>The hardest hit will be those who suffer at the best of times. Food charities have warned that millions will need food aid in the coming days. The government says military planners are organising a food delivery system for the 1.5 million people most vulnerable to coronavirus, and is developing a scheme to support the 1.6 million children who rely on free school meals \u2013 probably in the form of supermarket vouchers.</p> <p>This reliance on big retailers is shortsighted. While officials consult with business bosses, local authorities such as Newham in London have the information, experience and resources to reach people in need, but say they cannot get the cash they require. Other efforts, both commercial and social, need support, like the independent shops (in many cases still well stocked) which are launching local delivery services, or the restaurants offering to help feed the isolated.</p> <p>Relying on market forces has created many of the problems we now face. The pandemic is exposing our food system\u2019s fragility: a crucial warning in a world where other shocks \u2013 notably from climate change \u2013 will be heading our way. In a time of crisis, we must adapt fast. But there are still choices. This could be an opportunity to diversify our supply chain, promote sustainable agriculture, benefit local businesses and find new ways of serving communities. If it instead entrenches the hold of the supermarket giants it will not only be a missed opportunity, but will also leave us in a more precarious position to face the next crisis.</p>",

Who knows how many villains the coronaverse has yet to reveal to us?</p> <p>To recap the ones we are aware of, Martin enlivened Tuesday evening by releasing an occasionally coherent video in which he <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/coronavirus-wetherspoon-tim-martin-pub-closed-tesco-supermarket-uk-a9420906.html\">lurched round his kitchen</a> with a mug and put 43,000 people out of work. I can\u2019t tell you it divided the critics. Even in normal lighting, Martin looks like he\u2019s holding a torch under his chin and telling you a ghost story about what\u2019s going to happen to you in one of his pubs. Then again, every night is Halloween night down the \u2019Spoons, and Martin always wears the same costume: coarse fisherman whose wife is missing after 30 years of coercive control. Neighbours say she planned to leave him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/27/tesco-checkout-supervisor-coronavirus-frontline\">I joined Tesco for a stress-free life but now I'm on the coronavirus frontline | Simon Lord</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Like I said, it\u2019s just fancy dress.

Derbyshire police could then track and film one man\u2019s desperate attempt to get back to civilisation.

  "<p>On the eastern edge of Kolkata, near the smoking mountain of the city\u2019s garbage dump, the 15 million-strong metropolis dissolves into a watery landscape of channels and lagoons, ribboned by highways. This patchwork of ponds might seem like an unlikely place to find <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jan/25/kolkata-west-bengal-india-cites-fish-farming-sewage-food-demand-real-estate\">inspiration for the future of sustainable cities</a>, but that\u2019s exactly what Julia Watson sees in the marshy muddle.<br><br>The network of pools, she explains, are <em>bheris</em>, shallow, flat-bottomed fish ponds that are fed by 700m litres of raw sewage every day \u2013 half the city\u2019s output. The ponds produce 13,000 tonnes of fish each year. But the system, which has been operating for a century, doesn\u2019t just produce a huge amount of fish \u2013 it treats the city\u2019s wastewater, fertilises nearby rice fields, and employs 80,000 fishermen within a cooperative.</p> <p>Watson, a landscape architect, says it saves around $22m (\u00a318m) a year on the cost of a conventional wastewater treatment plant, while cutting down on transport, as the fish are sold in local markets. \u201cIt is the perfect symbiotic solution,\u201d she says. \u201cIt operates entirely without chemicals, seeing fish, algae and bacteria working together to form a sustainable, ecologically balanced engine for the city.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e9cd407a0257bd198c7342d601bcab6fa398d660\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9cd407a0257bd198c7342d601bcab6fa398d660/0_0_4134_2756/1000.png\" alt=\"\u2018A lot of the answers are already there\u2019 ... a small hut in the East Kolkata Wetlands.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A lot of the answers are already there\u2019 ... a small hut in the East Kolkata Wetlands.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brett Cole</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The wastewater <em>bheris</em> of the east Kolkata wetlands are one of the many examples of light-footed ecological practice that Watson has brought together in a new book, <a href=\"https://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/architecture/all/04698/facts.julia_watson_lotek_design_by_radical_indigenism.htm\">Lo-TEK: Design by Radical Indigenism</a>. The TEK stands not for technology, but \u201ctraditional ecological knowledge\u201d, something Watson thinks the so-called developed world could do well to learn from. \u201cWe are obsessed with technocratic solutions to mitigating the effects of climate change,\u201d she says. \u201cBut a lot of the answers are already there, and have been for generations. We just have to look.\u201d<br><br>Many of the phenomena were never intended to be solutions to ecological breakdown, but simple responses to local circumstance, practised for generations. Some are bound up in millennia-old mythologies and religious practice, while others, such as Kolkata\u2019s thriving aquaculture system, were the result of happy accident. According to local legend, in the 1920s a cultivator named Bidu Sarkar realised untreated wastewater from sewage pipes had started to flow into his fish pond. He expected disaster, but instead of killing his fish, the effluent doubled his yields.</p> <p>Others took note and followed his lead, realising the combination of sewage in the water and sunshine broke down the effluent and allowed plankton, which fish feed on, to grow exponentially. The fishponds now cover around 3,000 hectares, holding 300 fish farms, and the technique has caught on elsewhere in the world \u2013 in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Myanmar, Thailand, Germany and France.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9fb7c5ebf4498a8fea61604d1d103362100e4d2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9fb7c5ebf4498a8fea61604d1d103362100e4d2f/0_0_2756_4134/667.jpg\" alt=\"Going underground \u2026 a line of evenly spaced spoil craters snakes along the desert towards the Plains of Iraq, evidence of a subterranean man-made water stream called a qanat, first constructed by the Persians.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Going underground \u2026 a line of evenly spaced spoil craters snakes along the desert towards the Plains of Iraq, evidence of a subterranean man-made water stream called a qanat, first constructed by the Persians.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alireza Teimoury</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAs landscape architects,\u201d says Watson, \u201cwe are asked to design artificial wetlands in cities all the time.

And this has spawned a new population of displaced conservation refugees.<br><br>Many places in her global catalogue look like wonders of the world, on a par with the pyramids.

In a practice dating back to 100BC, the sinuous roots of rubber fig trees are trained over a scaffolding made from betel nut tree trunks, their centres hollowed out to provide a protective casing for the roots. Dangling aerial roots are woven into truss-like supports, then flat stones are laid across to form a solid deck.</p> <p>Over the course of their growth, the roots respond to the natural forces of the turbulent monsoon rivers, growing thicker and rooting deeper, making them extraordinarily efficient at load bearing. It is a form of slow infrastructure, with bridges planned a decade in advance, as rubber fig trees are planted at critical crossing points along rivers. This strategic planting is then used by future generations.<br><br>The tradition has survived, in part, because it is inextricably linked with the origin story of the Khasi, who believe their ancestors descended from a living root ladder that connected heaven and Earth, made of a rubber fig tree. The tree is considered sacred and, with it, the practice of bridge-building and ladder-weaving has been perpetuated in a fusion of mythology and technology that preserves culture, ecology and a way of life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"202a753198f2c01f3646171b7a353f5a77cc8142\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/202a753198f2c01f3646171b7a353f5a77cc8142/0_0_1938_2546/761.png\" alt=\"Water temple method ... subak rice terraces on steep volcanic hills in Bali.\" width=\"761\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Water temple method ... subak rice terraces on steep volcanic hills in Bali.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Lansing</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Watson describes how a similar spiritual reverence for the natural landscape has helped to conserve <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1194/\">the subak rice terraces in Bali</a>. In the steeply sloping volcanic hills, planting cycles are coordinated by a network of water temples, whose priests determine irrigation schedules according to calendrical rites. Before a fallow period, upstream temples release water into channels that feed a network of tiered terraces below. When all the fields are emptied simultaneously, pests migrating in search of food are eradicated.</p> <p>The effectiveness of this traditional system became all too apparent when the Indonesian government implemented a <a href=\"https://rethink.earth/resilience-lessons-from-a-water-goddess/\">Green Revolution</a> in the 1970s, bringing the use of massive quantities of fertiliser and pesticide to the rice terraces and ignoring the role of the water temples. Within a few seasons, yields plummeted, soil structure degraded, biodiversity diminished and the pests returned. The policy was abandoned in 1988, allowing the farmer-priests to return to their customary methods, and the area received Unesco World Heritage status in 2012. (This has come with its own set of problems, triggering an influx of tourists and stimulating development nearby.)</p> <p>The indigenous wisdom goes on.

He reported that one customer laid out kitchen towels on the floor outside the door, and asked him to place the bag on top. \u201cPerhaps that\u2019s a little excessive,\u201d Venturi says, \u201cbut taking it from his hand would mean standing closer than a metre.\u201d Simone wears a mask and always keeps a metre away from a customer, so he\u2019s not very worried.

  "<p>When John Erskine signed up a teenage Keir Starmer to the Labour club at Leeds University freshers\u2019 week in 1982, he had hoped to find a new recruit in the factional dogfight raging inside the party.</p> \n<p>But he was disappointed. Erskine recalls the young law student\u2019s politics as being of the \u201cnon-aligned, conscience-driven left\u201d \u2013 something like a kind of political Methodism.</p> \n<p>Instead of joining in the running battles with Militant, Starmer took the view there were \u201cno enemies on the left\u201d and cracked on with his studies.</p> \n<p>The overwhelming favourite to succeed Jeremy Corbyn, who steps down next weekend, Starmer has defied categorisation, declining to become a fully paid-up member of any of Labour\u2019s many overlapping sects.</p> \n<p>He is neither a Corbynite nor a Blairite (to the extent that they still exist) and is irritated by other people\u2019s urge to pigeon-hole him.</p> \n<p>Speaking to the Guardian as he launched his pitch for the leadership last December, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t find the badging of people helps, really. I don\u2019t need somebody else\u2019s name tattooed on my head to know what I think. There are fundamental principles.\u201d</p> \n<p>Starmer arrived at Leeds from Reigate grammar school, the only one of five siblings from a modest semi-detached house in Oxted, Surrey, to get to university.</p> \n<p>He has spoken movingly about his mother\u2019s 50-year battle with Still\u2019s disease, which ultimately led to her being confined to a wheelchair and unable to eat. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t have moaned. If you\u2019d asked her how she was, she\u2019d say \u2018fine, how are you?\u2019,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>After a postgraduate degree at Oxford, Starmer moved to London where he shared a rickety flat in Archway with old school friends.</p> \n<p>He joined the fashionably radical Doughty Street Chambers while carrying out pro-bono work for a string of apparently lost causes.</p> \n<p>Conor Foley, an international human rights lawyer and aid worker who now lives in Brazil, worked alongside Starmer at the campaign group Amnesty International in the 90s.</p> \n<p>The pair wrote a pamphlet, Foreign Policy, Human Rights and the UK, in 1998, making a string of recommendations, many of which were subsequently taken up by the Labour government.</p> \n<p>Tony Blair\u2019s incorporation of the provisions of the European convention on human rights (ECHR) into UK law in the Human Rights Act catapulted Starmer and his fellow human rights lawyers from the lefty fringe of their profession to the mainstream, as the judiciary scrambled to absorb its implications.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere were various people who were, three years before, on the unacceptable left, suddenly found themselves in positions of authority,\u201d says Conor Gearty, a professor of human rights law at the LSE and another old friend. \u201cBecause we knew about it and nobody else did.\u201d</p> \n<p>Foley agrees. \u201cThe Human Rights Act - there are probably four or five people in Britain who got that legislation and understood the importance of that legislation, and Keir and I were two of them. There were other people who played a more prominent role. But he has always understood the strategic significance of international human rights law.\u201d</p> \n<p>Foley says that while the pair were working together at Amnesty he didn\u2019t sense any burning ambition in Starmer to enter party politics. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t where we were at. I think he wanted to be a human rights lawyer. I think that was really his dream.\u201d</p> \n<p>And anyway the Labour party of the time wasn\u2019t much to their liking, he says. \u201cThe Blairite party wouldn\u2019t have been something either of us were comfortable with. Not that we were anti, we just weren\u2019t that comfortable with it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Starmer\u2019s appointment as director of public prosecutions (DPP) \u2013 a campaigning human rights lawyer turned the nation\u2019s chief prosecutor \u2013 surprised some of his radical friends.</p> \n<p>Leftwing critics tend to describe his five-year stint at the top of the 6,000-strong Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) as the final stage in Starmer\u2019s metamorphosis from firebrand QC to well-coiffed pillar of the establishment.</p> \n<p>They point to the all-night court sittings held to administer swift punishment to the 2011 rioters \u2013 which Starmer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/03/riot-prosecutions-sentences-keir-starmer\">subsequently claimed</a> had helped quell the disorder; and tough prosecuting guidance that imposed sentences of up to 10 years on benefits fraudsters.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"857831f4-ed8c-4dc5-9e5c-f4e3092b4731\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Rebecca Long-Bailey</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>A close ally of the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, the Salford MP and shadow business secretary has been groomed as a potential leftwing contender for the top job.</p>\n    <p><b>Pitch&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/29/rebecca-long-bailey-labour-party-britain\">Promising to champion \u201cprogressive patriotism\u201d</a>.</p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Lisa Nandy</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Wigan MP has built a reputation as a campaigner for her constituency and others like it, many of which have fallen to the Tories.

But in private, says one shadow cabinet colleague, the discussions were more robust.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe stretched the case as far as he could go but not to a point where he could be said to be out of line. But in the private meetings he was pushing very much harder. At every stage, we felt, and I said this many times, this is just a fucking ratchet.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some former MPs who lost their seats in pro-Brexit constituencies blame Starmer, in part, for the party\u2019s policy, which took many months of wrangling to arrive at and which infuriated leave voters.</p> \n<p>He insists it was a sensible way of dealing with a deeply divided party, with a deeply divided electorate, that once arrived at was not explained or sold to the public.</p> \n<p>Certainly he made few frontline media appearances during the campaign, instead touring local constituencies to boost morale with members and candidates, a role he had also played in 2017, awarding himself the moniker Captain Marginal.</p> \n<p>Is he now more politician than lawyer? Angela Smith, the Labour leader in the House of Lords, who has sat in the shadow cabinet throughout Starmer\u2019s time in parliament, believes so.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody who\u2019s dealt with the Labour party, the shadow cabinet, the issues that he\u2019s dealt with over the past few years, could be accused of not being a politician,\u201d Lady Smith says.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not the kind of weirdly Machiavellian type some people associate with the word politician, but he gets the politics of an issue.\u201d</p> \n<p>Erskine, who has watched Starmer\u2019s progress from afar since the Leeds days, says \u201ceverything is of a piece. It\u2019s of conscience, it\u2019s about incredible intellectual rigour, it\u2019s about being measured. And whilst it\u2019s not me, I have a lot of respect for it.\u201d</p> \n<p>That measured style until recently appeared out of political fashion. Whatever Corbyn\u2019s shortcomings, he was capable of rousing passion in his army of supporters. Even Starmer\u2019s most staunch supporters concede that is not really his style.</p> \n<p>One old friend recalls asking him to make a speech to a school about how he had risen from a pebble-dashed semi in Oxted to the top of his profession. It was an inspirational story, he recalls, but not an inspirational speech. \u201cHe\u2019s no David Lammy, Keir.\u201d</p> \n<p>Another cites what they recall as a serviceable but not outstanding address at the funeral of his predecessor in the Holborn and St Pancras seat, Frank Dobson, last December, with the great and the good of the Labour party, including four past and present leaders, in the congregation.</p> \n<p>One mourner recalls a non-plussed Labour grandee muttering afterwards: \u201cThat\u2019s the trouble with Keir: he doesn\u2019t rise to the occasion.\u201d</p> \n<p>But Smith, who has seen Starmer up close over the past five years, has little sympathy for those who complain that he lacks pizzazz.</p> \n<p>\u201cI get quite irritated when people talk about him being dull. He\u2019s serious \u2013 and I rather like people being serious, particularly when you\u2019re dealing with serious issues,\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>And with politics-as-usual on hold as the world wrestles with Covid-19 and its consequences \u2013 which have already swept decades-long orthodoxies in their wake \u2013 she adds: \u201cHe\u2019s a serious grownup politician. I think he\u2019s the right person at the right time.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>\u201cAlone, alone. All, all alone\u201d \u2013 Samuel Taylor Coleridge</p> <p>PG Wodehouse, interned in a lunatic asylum in Upper Silesia, rose buoyantly to the situation and wrote Joy in the Morning. \u201cWeeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning.\u201d</p> <p>He was well versed in the psalms and hardened to privation having been to a public school. No one who has been to Eton, they say, need fear prison. Which in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/jun/08/uk\">Jonathan Aitken\u2019s case</a> was just as well. Recently, forced to enjoy my own company, I have been remembering Roedean. As the school song said: \u201cVisions of schooldays will float now before us.\u201d It added, bafflingly, that the field would ring again and again with the tramp of the 22 men. For years I had no idea what the hell was going on.</p> <p>Dame Emmeline, the headmistress, had one of those undivided bosoms popularised by Queen Mary. More a shelf for resting stuff on. She had evacuated the school overnight from Brighton to Keswick with, I like to think, a Bible in one hand and a Baedeker in the other.</p> <p>The Lake District, full of leech gatherers and idiot boys, seems to have suited Wordsworth down to the ground. He quite liked wandering lonely as a cloud, though, in fact, his sister was always with him taking shorthand notes. Plucked from the boozy roar of my parents\u2019 pub, I hated it.</p> <p>I was soaking wet and hungry for four years non-stop. In the grounds of the Keswick Hotel was a lonely white parakeet, a gay prewar survivor, wind tossed and evil natured. I knew how it felt. I also thought it looked edible.</p> <p>Did I tell you about the vanishing pork pie? I will hold you with my glittering eye and tell you again. Every half holiday we had to climb a mountain. Suck on that thought for a second. I was very small and stout and the back of my legs were on fire but in my lunchbox was, unspeakable joy, a pork pie. Helvellyn is chamfered to a fine point in case you feel inclined to hang about and enjoy yourself.</p> <p>I perched gingerly and opened my lunch. The pie leaped out and raced to the bottom of the mountain in increasingly joyous bounds. Never was a pie so full of beans; so happy in its liberty. Much like David Attenborough when he shook off the shackles of being a BBC boss and, it is said, skipped down Wood Lane singing: \u201cFree at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, free at last!\u201d</p> <p>Standing by Sainsbury\u2019s empty shelves today, I see it still. Boing \u2026 boing \u2026 gone.</p> <p>Eventually the isolation gets to you.

  "<p>Three weeks ago, Tony Robinson completed a six-part series for Channel 5 \u2013 it starts tonight \u2013 charting a journey that took him around the world by train. Now, like the rest of us, he is being told not to walk to the end of the street. We were due to meet face to face for this interview, but we have to talk by phone instead. The upside is we have all the time in the world. \u201cI\u2019m one of those people who a few weeks ago would have looked at my watch and said: \u2018Is 10 minutes all right?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBut now \u2026\u201d He trails off. Everything has been cancelled: shooting on two other series; preparing a pitch for a third. What had been a crowded diary is empty.<br><br>\u201cAll my performance work went in one day,\u201d he says. \u201cHad that happened at another time I would have been so pissed off you can\u2019t imagine. But when it\u2019s happening to everybody, you just think: \u2018Oh, this is the way life is now.\u2019\u201d What did annoy him was that some of those postponing projects thought his age \u2013 he is 73 \u2013 might mean he couldn\u2019t resume them in the future. \u201cThat was distressing,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just old-fashioned ageism.\u201d<br><br>What is filling his life instead is a six-year-old west highland terrier he and his wife Louise have just brought back from an RSPCA rescue centre in Derby. \u201cIt was probably our last long car journey for a year. Who knows?\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s called Holly Berry and our flat [in west London] is full of joy. She\u2019s had a gruelling life and it\u2019s nice to pour our interest into an animal whose confidence is growing by the day.\u201d<br><br>Robinson is an obsessive worker, a fact obvious from a CV that encompasses acting, presenting, writing (TV series, children\u2019s books, an autobiography) and politics \u2013 he was on Labour\u2019s National Executive Committee from 2000 to 2004. He says he will carry on writing during the crisis, but also looks forward to spending more time with his wife and will \u201ctidy drawers that haven\u2019t been tidied for at least seven years\u201d.<br><br>Fortunately, the series for Channel 5 survived the lockdown. He travels across southern Europe, glories in the street life of South America, takes a train through Mexico and California, explores Canada and heads home via Russia and Scandinavia. It is an epic undertaking, conducted at whistlestop speed, and there are times when he looks knackered.<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s a celebration of life, a celebration of other people, a celebration of the world and of adventure,\u201d he says. \u201cEverything is so gloomy at the moment, but I was doing the final voiceover at a time when we could just explode with fun and laughter and my idiocy in the face of adversity, and we need to hold on to that. There\u2019s a limited amount of time during which we can mourn what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc68bdc01ca50454863bccdca5d45a5639edb10a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc68bdc01ca50454863bccdca5d45a5639edb10a/0_204_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It\u2019s a celebration of life, of other people\u2019 \u2026 Robinson with one of the Uros people who live on floating islands on Lake Titicaca.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s a celebration of life, of other people\u2019 \u2026 Robinson with one of the Uros people who live on floating islands on Lake Titicaca.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rumpus Media Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Among other adventures, Robinson gets licked on the face by a wolf at a polar park in Norway \u2013 he looks suitably terrified, not least as the wolf is about a foot taller than he is. He also tries to learn the tango in Argentina, dancing with a woman who is also about a foot taller than him \u2013 he accuses me of aggressive questioning when I point this out, though I assume he is not serious. Not too serious, anyway. He is very businesslike, focused and articulate \u2013 in every way the opposite of his great creation Baldrick, the originator of many ill-starred cunning plans in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/aug/24/blackadder-returns-cunning-plan-where-when-set\">the four series of Blackadder</a> that were comic high points of the 1980s.<br><br>It is tempting to see Robinson\u2019s career as this golden six-year Blackadder period and then everything else, but he is keen to resist this. He reminds me that immediately after he did Blackadder, he wrote and starred in the award-winning children\u2019s series Maid Marian and her Merry Men. He would also like the history and travel programmes he presents to be treated with a bit more respect. But he admits that Baldrick, which he did for the first time in his late 30s, transformed his career.<br><br>\u201cI had been working since I was 12, initially as a performer but later also as a writer and director, but in a very small way. Once I\u2019d done Blackadder, people thought I was one of those people like Stephen Fry and Richard Curtis who had that kind of capacity for wit and creativity, so for the first time in my life it was dead easy to get in the office door, and that\u2019s all you want really: to pitch and be taken seriously.\u201d<br><br>An only child \u2013 he reckons that is very significant \u2013 Robinson was brought up in north-east London. His father, who worked as a clerk for the local council, was an amateur pianist who doted on his son, and both his parents were keen on amateur dramatics. Robinson never seems to have given a thought to doing anything else but acting \u2013 despite being bright and going to a grammar school, he only managed four O-levels and gave up on his A-levels halfway through.<br><br>He made his professional debut at the age of 13 in the original production of Oliver! and went to the Central School of Speech and Drama when he was 17. He then spent 20 years as a jobbing actor and director, always managing to earn a reasonable living but never setting the showbiz world alight. The Blackadder producer John Lloyd told Robinson Baldrick would transform his career, and despite an iffy first series that almost led to the series being killed off, it did.<br><br>The irony is he didn\u2019t think much of the part of Baldrick when it was first offered to him, and says he only got it because no one else wanted it. Baldrick had been relatively smart in the first series, with Rowan Atkinson\u2019s Blackadder the dim one, but the relationship was inverted in series two to brilliant comic effect. He thinks Ben Elton joining as a writer for the second series was crucial. \u201cHe could look at it afresh,\u201d says Robinson, \u201cand realised Blackadder had to inhabit two worlds: in one he feels he is very smart, but in the other he\u2019s proven to be a complete tit, which is exactly the model of Hancock and Steptoe.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"97f0d31f800a964c3d85c73a9cd7a95f7fa270cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97f0d31f800a964c3d85c73a9cd7a95f7fa270cc/0_61_1936_1161/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robinson with Rowan Atkinson in Blackadder, 1989.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robinson with Rowan Atkinson in Blackadder, 1989.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Robinson says \u201cthe world was my oyster\u201d after Blackadder, and he became a regular on TV comedy shows. Yet within five years he had moved into presenting work. Had the acting and comedy world ceased to be his oyster? \u201cNo,\u201d he insists, \u201cbigger oyster in a different ocean. I\u2019ve always been very politically and socially engaged, so it was never difficult for me to make documentaries.\u201d He says he had addressed so many Labour party branch meetings that bringing dry subjects to life came naturally to him.<br><br>The success he had with the Channel 4 series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/mar/23/time-team-a-tv-gem\">Time Team</a>, which featured high-speed archaeological digs and ran from 1994 to 2014, marked the changeover from actor-presenter to presenter-actor. Critics were nonplussed by the switch. \u201cWhen I started presenting Time Team, there was some resentment,\u201d he says, \u201ccertainly among the more highbrow papers that could never resist a kind of waspish sting that someone who had previously earned their living as a comedian was addressing serious issues. It wasn\u2019t something I ever experienced from members of the public. No one ever came up to me in the street and said: \u2018What the fuck are you doing making documentaries when you are supposed to be telling jokes?\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s a real honour for an actor to have played a character who is so iconic</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But doesn\u2019t he miss the acting? \u201cI\u2019ve never really enjoyed doing eight shows a week [in the theatre],\u201d he says. \u201cDoing something repetitiously in that way is a bit of a killer.\u201d Does it bother him that, no matter what else he does, people still think of him as Baldrick? \u201cNot at all,\u201d he insists. \u201cIt\u2019s a real honour for an actor to have played a character who is so iconic. Maybe if it had happened when I was younger, I would have got a bit more precious about it, but I see it as bloody lucky.\u201d<br><br>His remarkably varied career \u2013 actor, presenter, public educator, political activist \u2013 led to him being knighted in 2013 for public and political service. Some wondered whether it was appropriate for a socialist to accept such an award, but he says that\u2019s a ridiculously \u201cbinary\u201d view. \u201cThe people who gave me that award were the honours committee, which is one of the best legacies of the Blair government. You are picked out for services to the state; it has nothing to do with the monarchy.\u201d<br><br>He also received flak for his marriage in 2011 to Louise Hobbs, <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/1832834/tony-robinson-70-defends-marriage-to-woman-younger-than-his-daughter-after-being-quizzed-by-stacey-solomon-on-loose-women/\">who is more than 30 years his junior</a>. When he appeared on <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/b0128hsb\">Desert Island Discs</a> in the same year, he dismissed the attacks as \u201cnasty, misogynistic press\u201d and said: \u201cIt\u2019s a shame really because it means I don\u2019t want to talk about her, whereas actually what I do want to do is talk about her.\u201d<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s foolish to discuss anything to do with that,\u201d he says now, \u201cbecause it just starts the whole machine whirring again.\u201d The key thing, he says, is that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/14/tony-robinson-my-daughter-used-to-call-me-tony-now-she-calls-me-dad\">it hasn\u2019t undermined his relationship with his two grown</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/14/tony-robinson-my-daughter-used-to-call-me-tony-now-she-calls-me-dad\">up children</a>, to whom he remains very close. When I remark that his daughter, <a href=\"https://www.laurashepherdrobinson.com/\">Laura Shepherd-Robinson</a>, is a novelist, he chides me. \u201c<em>A</em> novelist!?\u201d he says, his voice rising. \u201cShe\u2019s a very successful novelist.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cfefbacd581d2881e8fa481163d8c785075b4df3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfefbacd581d2881e8fa481163d8c785075b4df3/0_198_2320_1392/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robinson on Time Team, 2003.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robinson on Time Team, 2003.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Lawn/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>Like many who have worked in comedy \u2013 Tony Hancock and Les Dawson spring to mind \u2013 Robinson is a deeply serious person. The lifelong political engagement, born perhaps of his Jewish heritage and a father who loved a dialectical argument with his son, he insists is real and not an actorly pose. \u201cI\u2019m lucky being a performer because it means a lot of people will listen to me for the first 25 seconds, and for someone who wants to air ideas and political positions that\u2019s a great boon. But I don\u2019t articulate them because I\u2019m a performer. You have a responsibility to do it. I was instinctively very political from about the age of 13 and got involved in CND and anti-apartheid.\u201d<br>In 2014, he had a public spat with Michael Gove, the then minister for education, over whether Blackadder and Oh! What a Lovely War <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25612369\">should be shown in schools</a>. Gove thought they were unfair to the officer class; Robinson says that in reply he was \u201cvery robust about his [Gove\u2019s] failure to understand how teachers use teaching aids \u2013 it\u2019s not as though you wouldn\u2019t use Rupert Brooke to study the first world war because children might think the whole war rhymed\u201d.<br><br>Robinson insists his politics colours everything he does \u2013 even a round-the-world travel programme where he has chosen to travel by eco-friendly train and in which he often alludes to the effects of tourism and globalisation on the local population. <br><br>\u201cI see politics in everything I do,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t do is agitprop because I don\u2019t think it works. If you look at Maid Marian, that must have been the most political thing on children\u2019s television at the time. Look at Time Team \u2013 all of us were intensely political and passionate about bringing things to ordinary people who hadn\u2019t been to university and wouldn\u2019t otherwise have had them. Look at the documentaries I\u2019ve done.\u201d (Those include the powerful Me and My Mum in 2006 that dealt with his mother\u2019s dementia and her death in a nursing home.)<br><br>Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership tested Robinson\u2019s lifelong commitment to Labour, and he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tony_robinson/status/1124297214472400898?lang=en\">quit</a> last year after 45 years in the party, citing antisemitism, the muddled response to Brexit and poor leadership. He hasn\u2019t yet rejoined \u2013 he says he will \u201cwait and see what happens over the next year or so\u201d \u2013 but gets a vote in the leadership election through his membership of Jewish Labour. He won\u2019t tell me how he voted, but hints strongly it was for Keir Starmer.<br><br>He is, however, doubtful whether the centre can reassert itself. \u201cAll of us who are interested in politics have been saying the centre cannot hold. I think we\u2019ll feel that in spades by the time we\u2019ve got through this [the coronavirus crisis].\u201d He thinks the lockdown we are now enduring will lead to a fundamental reassessment of politics, and of culture too. When the crisis is finally over, it is unthinkable that the arts can just pick up where they left off because the world will look completely different. \u201cSitting in our houses and flats over the next however long it\u2019s going to be,\u201d he reflects, \u201cwe have the luxury of reinventing everything.\u201d <br><br><em>Around the World by Train with Tony Robinson starts at 8pm </em><em>tonight on Channel 5</em></p>",
  "<p>Joe Stirling, who has died aged 95, was 14 when he escaped \u2013 twice \u2013 from Nazi Germany to a warm welcome in Great Britain and a safe haven in Norwich.

He waded across a river and walked through Luxembourg and Belgium into Holland. A kindly Dutch policeman, concerned the boy would be turned away without a visa, smuggled him back into Germany.</p> <p>Within a fortnight, in July 1939, G\u00fcnter boarded a train to safety. Their farewell at Cologne station was the last time he saw his parents.

He then attended Yardley grammar, a Birmingham school evacuated to Lydney, Gloucestershire, where he lived with another family, the Allsopps. </p> <p>He was offered a place to study chemistry at Birmingham University, but turned it down to volunteer for the British army. He was advised to change his name, and chose Sterling after the currency, but the officer wrote Stirling; his comrades called him Joe. He served in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, then the Educational Corps, and met Jean Skitmore, a Norfolk woman serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. They married in 1946.</p> <p>Settling in Norfolk, in Attleborough and then Norwich, he worked in accounts for a brush factory. In 1950 he became the full-time Labour party secretary-agent for the Central Norfolk constituency and then in Norwich; he was a councillor from 1958 to 1961. A colleague asked him to organise a Rhineland holiday for Labour Club members and after much research, and a poignant family holiday to his old haunts, he led a 30-strong party to Germany in 1955. Two years later he began operating trips abroad and Stirling Holidays was born.</p> <p>After retiring at 73, he indulged a love of classical music at concerts and was a volunteer visitor at the elderly lifers unit in Norwich prison, where he played scrabble with Ronnie Biggs.

This makes it easier to keep an eye on people, and to avoid social isolation.\u201d</p> <p>West has issued a video message to students, urging them to look out for each other and be kind. \u201cWe have to understand that students will go through all sorts of emotional challengesover the next few months,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are months of disruption ahead. Students quite rightly want certainty and they want structure. I can give them some of that, but I can\u2019t give them everything.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Dominique Thompson, who was a GP at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/universityofbristol\">University of Bristol</a> for 20 years, said: \u201cA student bedroom is a small space, maybe only a single bed and a desk with a chair. Being stuck in there if you can\u2019t go home can be challenging.\u201d Thompson is worried that the virus will cause anxiety symptoms to worsen among young people. </p> <p>\u201cThat feeling of powerlessness that this is giving us all may be overwhelming, particularly for students who are a long way from home,\u201d she said.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.truestudent.com/blog/coping-with-coronavirus-anxiety\">Thompson advises </a><a href=\"https://www.truestudent.com/blog/coping-with-coronavirus-anxiety\"> those stuck on campus</a> to continue some sort of routine, including exercise and contacting others. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to concentrate at the moment but even half an hour using your brain will make you feel better,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd think ahead to when this is over. If you\u2019d like to travel, look up websites and create an imaginary itinerary.\u201d</p> <p>Christopher Tucker, the director of residence life at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/universityofedinburgh\">Edinburgh University</a>, said his team had a list of everyone still on campus who may need extra mental health support, and would call them twice a week. Theteam is also asking students to notify them if they are worried about their flatmates. \u201cAt this stage we have to treat everyone as anxious,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cNormally we can see the state of someone\u2019s bedroom and there are visual clues about how they are managing. We are having to do that through Skype, which is harder. Often people play down what they are going through, so we have to listen and look for clues.\u201d</p> <p>But West said universities were also wrestling with the opposite challenge: young people who feel invincible and may not understand why it matters to maintain physical distance on campus. \u201cOur security team is telling students that it isn\u2019t just about them: you may feel well, but you could still be infecting people. I put it bluntly \u2013 you may save your friend\u2019s or parent\u2019s life.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>At getting on for 94, Jan Morris is realistic that this will probably be her last book. For the past 70 years she has roamed far and wide: as a journalist she was at the triumphant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/gallery/2013/may/23/mount-everest-first-successful-ascent-in-pictures\" title=\"\">ascent of Everest in 1953</a> and was there too for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/26/adolf-eichmann-trial-evil\" title=\"\">trial of Adolf Eichmann</a> in 1961. Most famously in the early 1970s she described what it was like to be in the advance guard of gender reassignment when she transitioned from James to Jan via surgery in Casablanca. Her historical writing has tended to the epic: her trilogy on the rise and fall of the British empire, <em>Pax Britannica</em>, is a monumental work that feels as if it had access to every heartbeat under the searing sun.</p> <p>Morris has now turned to a new way of writing that allows her to stay put. She has started to keep a diary, and it is the second instalment, covering 130 days from the beginning of spring 2018, that makes up <em>Thinking Again</em>. Don\u2019t imagine, though, that there is anything reduced about this new world. Morris has long admired the diary form for its capaciousness, and sticking within a small radius of the converted north Wales barn where she now lives allows her to roam far and wide in her imagination, unfettered by time or space.</p> <p>The result is a beguilingly supple narrative, able to absorb all the contradictions and revisions that mark a long, well-remembered life. For instance, Morris begins Day 90 feeling curmudgeonly at the approach of yet another festive season: \u201cI am no good at Christmas.\u201d From here she explains that she hates that time of year because as a chorister at Christ Church, she was obliged to spend her boyhood Christmases far away from home and hard at work in a surplice. But just when we feel that we have got a clear mental picture of young James as a scowling prewar cherub, Morris proceeds to give us a heartfelt song of how those Christ Church Christmases \u201chave remained high points of my life\u2019s long memory\u201d. It was, she says, not just the \u201cgrand artistic legend\u201d of the nativity story, set to glorious music, that has stayed with her, but also \u201cthe distillation of goodness among beautiful buildings and kind strangers\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"15e066b549c5743e31b4284517c83044dfff668b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15e066b549c5743e31b4284517c83044dfff668b/0_299_3200_1919/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Choristers at Christ Church, Oxford, in the 1950s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Choristers at Christ Church, Oxford, in the 1950s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jimmy Sime/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cKind\u201d emerges as a key term for Morris, the capstone of everything she holds most dear. At times she wonders out loud whether it might not be possible to form a religion around the concept, before remembering that we have several already. So instead she takes great pleasure in recording those many occasions on which complete strangers have gone out of their way to help her when she has been in need \u2013 with her car, her shopping, or even her own failing body as she sets out every morning to complete her daily 1,000 paces with her trusty walking stick, come rain, shine or treacherous ice.</p> <p>Morris may be idealistic, but she\u2019s also astringent about the many times in her own life when she has failed to be kind. Her particular mea culpa is reserved for her treatment of \u201cmy Elizabeth\u201d, once her wife and now her civil partner, who lives with her but is lost to dementia. At times she admits to being \u201cunforgivably cruel\u201d: \u201cI use words and phrases I despise, adopt rude attitudes that are not my own and think things I am ashamed to remember.\u201d On the evidence of the diary, however, Morris seems positively saint-like. She is brave enough, too, to resist editing out those things that a younger, more craven writer would worry about. For instance, she happily tells us that her favourite thing on TV is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/21/mrs-browns-boys-at-christmas\" title=\"\"><em>Mrs Brown\u2019s Boys</em>,<em> </em></a>the sitcom starring Brendan O\u2019Carroll in drag \u2013 \u201cso frank as to be innocent \u2026 it never fails to cheer me up\u201d. Even more startling is the way she is determined to give Donald Trump the benefit of the doubt. Yes, he may be crass and boorish in private, but she likes his political style. What\u2019s more, she asks with a touching optimism and in this rare case a lack of knowledge, \u201cHe must, I know, be a man of true abilities \u2013 how else could he have assembled his immense financial holdings?\u201d</p> <p>These revelations, from someone who insists on rereading a chapter of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/31/rereading-anna-karenina-james-meek\" title=\"\"><em>Anna Karenina</em></a> every night, come as a jolt. But that, of course, is the great joy of the diary format. It allows a personality to unfold without any requirement that the author smoothes out the snags. The result isn\u2019t exactly unvarnished \u2013 Morris admits that she still spends an inordinate amount of energy crafting her prose before setting it before us \u2013 but it gets us closer to the sources of her art than we have been before.</p> <p>\u2022<em> Thinking Again is published by Faber (RRP \u00a316.99).

But it\u2019s no ordinary game: it\u2019s the first-ever England versus Scotland international!</p> <p>Except it\u2019s not, not really. Scotland\u2019s team isn\u2019t a Scottish team at all. Cobbled together by a shower down south, the \u201cScotland\u201d XI\u2019s star man is Mr WH Gladstone, Welsh son of the serving prime minister. Most of the rest of the side are Londoners born within the sahnd of yer actual Bow Bells. The game ends in a 1-1 draw, England scrambling an equaliser in the dying seconds, though the Scots aren\u2019t having any of it. The game won\u2019t count. Everyone will have to wait until November 1872 for the first official football international. (And what a game that will be, 0-0 between Scotland and England at the West of Scotland Cricket Club, Partick. But that\u2019s a tale for another day.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/sep/13/the-joy-of-six-champions-sport-different-kinds\">The Joy of Six: champions | Daniel Harris</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The impudence of the English in setting up the 1870 stramash without actually asking anyone north of the border about it! This sorry state of affairs led a collection of Scottish clubs \u2013 Edinburgh Academical, Glasgow Academical, West of Scotland, Merchistonian, and St Salvator of St Andrews \u2013 to challenge England\u2019s Football Association to an official international game of football. However, these clubs had \u2013 unlike the English, and a small smattering of folk in Scotland \u2013 yet to embrace association, and so the \u201cfootball\u201d challenge actually referred to the old rugby football rules.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the FA \u2013 concentrating on new-fangled soccer \u2013 ignored this challenge, but Blackheath picked up the gauntlet and set about arranging a squad to represent England in a rugby game to be held at Raeburn Place, Edinburgh, on Monday 27 March 1871.</p> <p>And so to the game which, sad to say, was a lot of nonsense. With both teams fielding 20 men, the match was effectively a 100-minute maul. It didn\u2019t help that the English considered the pitch far too narrow; it restricted their speedy backs, and played into the hands of a fitter and stronger Scottish pack.</p> <p>After a scoreless first half, the Scots heaved Angus Buchanan over the line for rugby\u2019s first-ever international try. Whether it was kosher or not is a moot point: it was unclear whether the ball had been grounded, and referee Dr HH Almond \u2013 a local headmaster instrumental in the early development of rugby in Scotland \u2013 had a decision to make. With England complaining vociferously, he sided with the Scots, arguing that \u201cwhen an umpire is in doubt, he is justified in deciding against the side which makes the most noise. They are probably in the wrong.\u201d And yet Buchanan\u2019s try didn\u2019t trouble the scorers; all it did was give place kicker William Cross the chance to \u201ctry\u201d for a goal. Cross converted the kick for one rugby football point!</p> <p>England crossed the tryline themselves through Reginald Birkett \u2013 who would later play for the soccer team in between the sticks \u2013 but his try wasn\u2019t converted. Cross went over for Scotland \u2013 umpire Almond again at the centre of controversy, this time ignoring a knock-on \u2013 but he missed his second kick, and the game ended 1-0 to the Scots.</p> <h2>2) England 16\u201321 Scotland (1938)</h2> <p>One hundred years later to the day, Murrayfield staged a friendly to commemorate the centenary of that historic game. Once again, Scotland ran out victors, only this time it was a wee bit more resounding: England were hammered 26-6, having conceded a try after 13 seconds, captain John Spencer fumbling near his line to allow John Frame to nip through and score. The margin of victory \u2013 a five-try rout \u2013 was Scotland\u2019s biggest against England since 1905. The win capped a heady week for Scottish rugby. Scotland had won the Calcutta Cup seven days previously, winning at Twickenham for the first time in 33 years \u2013 and dramatically so, Peter Brown converting Chris Rea\u2019s last-minute try to edge out the auld enemy by a single point, 16-15. (They were also recipients of the wooden spoon in that 1971 Five Nations, but let\u2019s not fudge the point.)</p> <p>Scotland\u2019s previous win at HQ, in 1938, was one of the classic routs. Not that the winning margin \u2013 21-16 \u2013 was anything to write home about. But the Scots ran in five tries to England\u2019s one \u2013 tries were only worth three points in 1938 \u2013 and would have recorded a thumping victory had they converted all their scores. As it was, they missed all their conversions, though kicker Wilf Crawford can\u2019t be blamed too much: the match was played in mist and high winds, and he did belt over two penalties, one from over 50 yards.</p> <p>Scotland\u2019s man of the match was Wilson Shaw, who set up the first, early try of the match with a kick to the corner, scored himself later in the first half, and sealed the deal with a sashay through a thicket of players late in the game; the Guardian talks of a \u201clightning\u201d player who \u201cran clean through the defence and scored amid pandemonium\u201d. Shaw was carried off the field \u201cshoulder high in triumph\u201d. It was just as well Scotland grabbed the opportunity to celebrate with both hands. Since Shaw\u2019s match, they have only subsequently won at Twickers on two occasions: the aforementioned 16-15 win in 1971, and a Roy Laidlaw inspired 22-12 win in 1983 which, while deserved, was a scoreline slightly embellished by seven points added in injury time.</p> <h2>3) Scotland 12\u201330 England (1980)</h2> <p>England sealed their first grand slam since 1957 here, ending 23 extremely dull years of waiting. Now, the game of the campaign was the rumble against Wales at Twickenham. Paul Ringer was sent off for the visitors after a 14-minute cameo which included two episodes of windmilling fists and a high tackle. A late try by Elgan Rees should have sealed the win for the Welsh \u2013 who had won four of the last five Five Nations \u2013 but Rees neglected to ground the ball near the posts, and the conversion was missed, all of which allowed England to steal the victory thanks to an injury-time penalty from Dusty Hare. Having already beaten Ireland and France, the triple crown, championship, and grand slam was on. \u201cIt is a great feeling, and a strange one, to have played three and won three,\u201d said captain Bill Beaumont. (His disbelief was understandable; England had been 8-1 shots to win the championship back in January, fourth in a field of five behind Wales, France and Ireland.)</p> <p>At Murrayfield, with glory beckoning against a team who had started the campaign as 20-1 outsiders, Clive Woodward stepped up to the plate for England. First he skedaddled down the left wing to set up Mike Slemen for the opening try of the game. Soon enough, he was repeating the trick down the opposite flank, John Carleton the beneficiary. Carleton quickly added another and, by the time 30 minutes were up, England were leading 16-0 and cruising to victory.</p> <p>After the break, Scotland started flinging the ball around, opting to run everything in the swashbuckling manner. They were rewarded with two tries \u2013 one a superlative solo effort by John Rutherford \u2013 but England went over the line two more times themselves, Carleton becoming the first player to score a hat-trick of tries since 1924. \u201cI am a bit resentful that some people have labelled us a poor side,\u201d said Beaumont after being hoisted around Edinburgh on white-shirted shoulders. \u201cIt seems like sour grapes to me. Any team that wins both away matches by scoring heavily\u201d \u2013 they had won 17\u201313 in Paris against a much-fancied French side \u2013 \u201cmust deserve the sort of rewards we have earned.\u201d</p> <h2>4) Scotland 6\u20139 England (1988)</h2> <p>Nobody would claim the Calcutta Cup as an aesthetic masterpiece \u2013 a stumpy little pot, it\u2019s the Gareth Chilcott of international sporting trophies \u2013 though it does have a beautiful history. Ex-pats in India had briefly formed the Calcutta Football Club in the mid-1870s, only to disband and melt down the remaining silver rupees in the club kitty (\u00a360 worth) to make a cup bearing the club\u2019s name, which the Rugby Football Union back at home could use for the big England-Scotland showdown. The three-handled cup \u2013 the handles being cobras, and an elephant on the lid \u2013 was first contested in 1879, retrospectively awarded to the teams for their earlier wins between 1871 and 1878, and has been an annual fixture, wars aside, ever since.</p> <p>Sadly, it is now jiggered beyond belief. England like to show it off in the Twickenham museum whenever they win it, but only from behind the glass of a safety case, inside which it revolves slowly like a prize on a 1970s game show. The Blankety Blank chequebook and pen of international sporting trophies HA. The most infamous damage to the trophy was sustained in 1988, when \u2026 ah, but first, the game. About which there\u2019s happily not much to say: Rob Andrew scored a drop goal, while Gavin Hastings and Jon Webb slotted two penalties apiece, one of Webb\u2019s a 50-metre matchwinner. \u201cEngland may have been the birthplace of rugby but today they effectively killed the game stone dead,\u201d cried Scotland coach Derrick Grant after the game, of the victorious side\u2019s spoiling tactics.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>But as anyone who has ever quaffed real ale through hosiery will attest, rugby is not just about the football. And this dire spectacle was retrospectively transformed into one of the most memorable Calcutta Cup occasions at the after-match banquet. England had turned up late to the dinner, only to find the Scots \u2013 who had finished their Five Nations campaign and were busy unwinding \u2013 had drained all the free bottles of whisky that had been provided. Predictably enough, the event soon descended into a food and booze fight. In the bedlam, Scotland\u2019s John Jeffrey and English police constable Dean Richards filled the cup with champagne, dispatched the contents into Brian Moore\u2019s face, and scampered out of the hotel and down the Royal Mile. Richards was wearing a tea cosy as a hat.</p> <p>After an evening showcasing their passing and kicking skills on the cobbled Edinburgh avenues, the cup \u2013 along with the players \u2013 were the worse for wear the morning after. \u201cWhoopees with the rupees,\u201d punned the Guardian, reporting that blazers from both the Scottish and English unions were investigating the matter. Jeffrey was banned for six months, Richards for a game. An Edinburgh jeweller did his best to knock the battered old trophy back into shape, and the world \u2013 like the display case at Twickers \u2013 continued to turn. Although if this sort of charming buffoonery were to happen in today\u2019s painfully serious climate, you can bet your last melted-down coin that it would suddenly stop.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GO3YaUdERpg\" title=\"\">5) Scotland 13\u20137 England (1990)</a></h2> <p>Both teams went into this match, their final game in the 1990 Five Nations, with a chance to win the grand slam. Only one team was given a hope, though. \u201cScotland will start as underdogs,\u201d reported the Guardian on the morning of the winner-takes-all slam showdown, a first in Five Nations history. \u201cEngland are the bookmaker\u2019s favourites at 3-1 on, at the climax of a season that has followed an ever upward curve. If international rugby was a rational business, then the Scots\u2019 creaking performances against the Irish and the Welsh would point to a severe drubbing by England. Thus far, David Sole\u2019s team have scored just five tries compared to England\u2019s 11, with two of them coming against the 14 men of France. In addition, the Scots have been missing a worrying number of penalties, while the England full-back, Simon Hodgkinson, has kicked 74 points in five games for his country.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/20/the-joy-of-six-unsung-sporting-heroes-of-2017\">The Joy of Six: unsung sporting heroes of 2017</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If international rugby was a rational business \u2026 but when Sole led his men out slowly into the Edinburgh afternoon, a show of measured determination that put hot favourites England into a flat spin, we were offered proof that it was not.

Jeremy Guscott waltzed over for a try down the left to pull the score back to 6-4, but England would never draw level. Hodgkinson was unwilling to trust his boot in the high winds, so captain Will Carling was forced to run penalties \u2013 decisions the Scots took as arrogance. England\u2019s attempts to break through the thin blue line repeatedly came to nothing; Carling, Rory Underwood and Richard Hill were battered by John Jeffrey, Finlay Calder and Scott Hastings.</p> <p>When Tony Stanger bombed over in the right-hand corner to give the Scots a 13-4 lead early in the second half, the jig was effectively up for the visitors. England, defeated, nevertheless ended the championship with a points difference of plus 64, one short of the Five Nations record. But the Scots had grabbed the prize. \u201cThat solemnity was a totally conscious decision,\u201d said Sole of his pre-match psych-out. \u201cIt stemmed from the belief that we wanted England to know from the outset that a grand slam meant as much to us as it did for them, and we were not for a moment going to flinch or be afraid of the battle. The English were extremely confident; we were extremely hungry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wish you could have heard some of the lip Finlay was giving them at the end of the lineout,\u201d added Jeffrey. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t print it if I told you. Just say it was all addressed to the subject of a sharp deflation of arrogance.\u201d</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPt1fk-g2_I\" title=\"\">6) England 42\u201320 Scotland (2007)</a></h2> <p>Scotland\u2019s 1990 victory might just be the greatest team performance in the history of the Calcutta Cup. There is no questioning what the greatest individual effort is. At the end of the 2003 World Cup final, Jonny Wilkinson famously kicked the drop goal that won the Webb Ellis Trophy for England. One thousand, one hundred and sixty eight injury-ravaged days later, he played his next game for his country. He made sure everyone noticed he was back.</p> <p>\u201cImagine Tiger Woods missing 30 major championships in a row then shooting a 63 in his comeback at the Open,\u201d wrote Robert Kitson in this paper. \u201cOr Roger Federer strolling into Wimbledon after an injury-strewn three-year sabbatical and not dropping a set in the first week.

It was the third time he\u2019d done it, a world record. Admittedly his try was dodgy in the extreme, and Exhibit A when you\u2019re arguing with any fool who claims video evidence in sport does away with controversy \u2013 Wilkinson\u2019s foot was miles into touch, but was waved through by the video referee anyway \u2013 but Scotland were on the end of a four-try battering anyway, Jason Robinson scoring twice, Magnus Lund the other.</p> <p><em>\u2022 With thanks to Cris Freddi</em></p>",
  "<p>\u2018We all know that the president is a pathological liar,\u201d Mehdi Hasan says from his office in Washington DC. \u201cBut the lies he\u2019s been telling about the coronavirus \u2013 they\u2019re no joke; they cost American lives. The US media\u2019s failure to call Donald Trump out on those lies in real time makes part of the media, I\u2019m sorry to say, partly complicit in those deaths, too.\u201d Hasan, who moved from the UK to the US in 2015, is that rare species of TV interviewer: not in it to make friends, to network or to gain access. His passion for grilling his subjects is only matched by his frustration at his peers who do not do the same.</p> <p>When the White House press corps <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/29/white-house-correspondents-dinner-michelle-wolf-stuns-media-with-sarah-sanders-attack\">turned on the comedian Michelle Wolf</a> after the 2018 White House correspondents\u2019 dinner and defended Trump\u2019s press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, it was the last straw for him. In that moment, he realised that the US media is almost \u201cirredeemable\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf not now, when?\u201d he asks. \u201cIf they\u2019re not going to stand up against this administration\u2019s secretary, then who?\u201d A credulous New York Times headline in the wake of the 2019 El Paso shooting, \u201cTrump Urges Unity vs Racism\u201d, was, to him, just another stitch in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/07/trump-praises-new-york-times-headline-that-sparked-uproar-after-shootings\">the pattern of this submission</a>. \u201cThe American press doesn\u2019t want to rock the boat, and so things are just reported straight.\u201d</p> <p>Such forthrightness has served Hasan well. Not only have his hard-hitting political interviews become regular viral hits, he has also become a fixture on the high-profile US cable news circuit. Rumours are beginning to circulate on the east coast about offers to host his own show on a US network. On such approaches he is coyly amused when I ask him, maintaining only that he very much loves his job at the moment.</p> <p>As an interviewer, he is relentless, a quality that boosted his profile after Trump came to office and the US media seemed unable to land a glove on the new president or his surrogates. As a columnist for the online magazine <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/\">the Intercept</a> and the host of <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/upfront/\">UpFron</a>t and <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/headtohead/\">Head to Head</a> on Al Jazeera English, Hasan has developed a reputation for somehow managing to nail dissimulating politicians by being forensic and refusing to move on until his point is made. His technique is simple. \u201cMost people ask the question and move on whether they get an answer or not,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Hasan, 40, was already a successful journalist in the UK when he moved to the US to host an interview show for Al Jazeera English. An established pundit and political analyst with a diverse journalistic background, he has worked in TV at Sky News and Channel 4, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/15/ed-miliband-mehdi-hasan-james-macintyre-review\">co-authored a book about Ed Miliband</a>, and served stints as the political editor of the New Statesman and political director of the Huffington Post UK. For all that it seems like a charmed career, Hasan describes it as \u201crandom\u201d. He started out on the bottom rung as a freelance news assistant at ITN and puts his success down to those \u201cwilling to take a chance\u201d on him.</p> <p>But it was in the US where he really began to cut through. Clips of his Al Jazeera English interviews began to catch fire online. A clash with the Trump adviser and Fox News regular Steven Rogers in November 2018 heralded Hasan\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbh2Y-V0Cqc\">arrival in the mainstream</a>. In it, he questions Rogers on Trump\u2019s lies on birth right citizenship, among other falsehoods. Rogers starts out with bluster before quickly squirming and deflating under Hasan\u2019s barrage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5d3ffb139275ca686cd3a5a675b0e7835241c41d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d3ffb139275ca686cd3a5a675b0e7835241c41d/56_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mehdi Hasan interviews Steven Rogers on Al Jazeera English\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mehdi Hasan interviews Steven Rogers on Al Jazeera English.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Al Jazeera</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To date, a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mehdirhasan/status/1062706401804455937)\">clip of the interview</a> in which Hasan pummels Rogers has had almost 8m views on Twitter alone. It brought him to the attention of Seth Myers, who, when interviewing Hasan, called the Rogers interrogation \u201cthe template for talking to people within the Trump-sphere\u201d. Hasan has recently also developed a following among Hollywood stars with an activist bent. Mark Ruffalo tweeted the Rogers interview saying: \u201cThere is such thing as the truth, even today. This is how a journalist does their job to uncover it.\u201d</p> <p>Hasan seems an unlikely figure to break America. And he has done it thanks to online word of mouth; shares, clicks and endorsements from high-profile figures. He is a practising Muslim and unabashedly leftwing. He is abrasive and pugilistic, with an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mehdirhasan?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">endless appetite for Twitter beef</a> that is often beneath him. He sees these \u201coutsider\u201d qualities, as he calls them, not as weaknesses but as strengths that enable him to transcend the pitfalls of a US news media paralysed by an old-fashioned courteousness towards those in political office.</p> <p>But despite the rough edges, he is a public school boy, and he admits that the confidence his private schooling and Oxford education (he studied that favourite of future prime ministers, Politics, Philosophy and Economics), has been invaluable in compensating for the fact that there are very few people like him in the British or US media. The \u201coutsiderness\u201d was from being a Muslim and the son of immigrants.</p> <p>He describes the household he grew up in as, although conventional, \u201cdisputatious\u201d. And Hasan certainly enjoys sparring, but one gets the sense that it is not just this that holds the key to his interviewing technique. It is a lack of respect for power, for default authority, that animates him. \u201cWhen I used to watch American TV religiously during the Bush and Obama years,\u201d says Hasan, \u201cI would joke about if you parachuted in a John Humphrys or a [Jeremy] Paxman, what would happen? The British press, the British media, for all its flaws, does not have this culture of deference when it comes to interviewing a person in power. I am amazed that the press stands up when the president enters the room. They don\u2019t do that for Boris Johnson.\u201d</p> <p>Even in the US, he says, the interviews that create a buzz are those by British interviewers: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwN1py3dV2g\">Emily Maitliss talking to Sean Spicer</a>, or Andrew Neil to rightwing controversialist <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VixqvOcK8E\">Ben Shapiro</a>. \u201cShapiro lives on US TV, not just on Fox, on CNN, on Bill Maher and all sorts of shows. Why did it take Andrew Neil to come along and poke holes in the complete facade of Ben Shapiro? There\u2019s a culture of deference not just to people in power, it\u2019s the politeness. You have to get in people\u2019s faces.\u201d</p> <p>It is something he advises British journalists to do with Johnson, for whom Hasan interned at the Spectator, when the now prime minister was the magazine\u2019s editor. He recalls a genial and polite Johnson, but remembers how the \u201cuntucking of the shirt and the ruffling of the hair\u201d was clearly a deliberate act before meetings. While he does not believe that Johnson is as bad as Trump (who he says is \u201cunique\u2019 in his pathologies), he sees the danger of Johnson\u2019s populism and the media\u2019s complicity in both creating him and continuing to be soft on him. \u201cI use the L-word, \u2018lie\u2019, I use the R-word, \u2018racism\u2019. In the Trump era, you have to be able to use these words. In the Brexit era, you have to be able to use these words. And there\u2019s still a real shyness and reluctance for journalists to do that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9573083fbfba6f1d77754b4ec3449842193b1ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9573083fbfba6f1d77754b4ec3449842193b1ee/0_105_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mehdi Hasan being interviewed on Late Night with Seth Meyers in 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The tables are turned \u2026 Hasan being interviewed on Late Night with Seth Meyers in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hasan\u2019s righteousness is infectious, but it has not always served him well. A zealous address he made over a decade ago to a Muslim congregation in the UK has cast a long shadow. The remarks are recycled and used against him by his opponents on a regular basis. His observations, caught on camera, on <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/al-jazeera-host-mehdi-hasan-apologizes-for-past-criticisms-of-non-believers/\">non-Muslims</a> (\u201ccattle\u201d), homosexuals and atheists, are hard to style out. He has addressed these comments often, most recently on Twitter, where he said: \u201cLike a lot of journos (humans?) I\u2019ve said things years ago that I now deeply regret.\u201d</p> <p>When I ask him about this, he is prepared. \u201cDumb comments,\u201d he says. But his contrition is laced with a defiance, because he believes that non-Muslims are not held to account in the same way. \u201cBoris Johnson\u2019s comments haven\u2019t stopped him from being prime minister, ones he hasn\u2019t even disowned. Why?\u201d he asks. \u201cBecause I\u2019m Muslim; there\u2019s no debate about that.\u201d</p> <p>His argument is borne out by an incident last July when Marco Rubio posted a clip of a 2018 Hasan interview with Ilhan Omar, aggressively edited to make her appear racist against white people. \u201cIt increases abuse and death threats to her, and to me. I wish I could switch off,\u201d he says. The political climate in the US is one of constant threat to public figures such Omar and himself.</p> <p>Despite the prejudice and scrutiny that he says he and other Muslims and minorities in the public eye face, he sees a counterintuitive solidarity with Muslims developing in the US. Trump has been so nakedly Islamophobic and xenophobic that it has pushed \u201cmany people off the fence\u201d, he thinks. The \u201csilver lining\u201d is that the open season on Muslims and immigrants has created a group of Trump\u2019s opponents that is happy to support them. Hasan\u2019s American experience is of a country that is becoming less Islamophobic and less anti-immigration, even as Trump\u2019s Islamophobic rhetoric intensifies.

Hasan has clearly been on a journey over the past few years, and when he talks about what really drives him, the professional interlocutor tenor, which sometimes feels like a hammer dropping relentlessly on an anvil, changes to a softer tone. \u201cFundamentally it\u2019s about one thing, it\u2019s about avoiding the dehumanisation of other people,\u201d he says. \u201cThe No 1 issue in my lifetime right now is tribalism. I\u2019m going to be there for human rights and civil rights. When I see the stuff I said in my 20s, across the board should I have been more careful? Yes. Because you cannot speak about people in sweeping terms. That is the No 1 lesson of life.\u201d</p> <p>That, however, doesn\u2019t mean he holds back on sweeping terms when criticising the rest of the US media. Despite his success, Hasan\u2019s style of journalism is in the minority. The media \u201cgave Trump a free pass in 2015\u201d, he frets, and Trump\u2019s ongoing bigotry is still treated with \u201cboth sides\u201d equivocation. \u201cMy biggest worry, frustration, regret, annoyance, is that they don\u2019t seem to have learned many lessons and we seem to be going down the same path for 2020.\u201d</p> <p>The media\u2019s handling of Trump during the Covid-19 pandemic has given Hasan little reassurance. \u201cWhen the president turns up at the White House briefing room and falsely claims there\u2019ll be 5m tests within a month or that Google will be involved in the testing or that people are being tested at airports coming into the country, isn\u2019t it shameful that even now, no reporter stands up and says: \u2018Mr President, why should we believe a damn word you say?\u2019\u201d</p>",

We <em>need</em> to put US workers <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/24/politics/trump-coronavirus-economy-open-health/index.html\">back to work</a> as quickly as possible to slow the economic damage inflicted by mass physical distancing policies.

Yet our economy today is dramatically different from that of the early 20th century.</p> <p>American goods and services are reliant on the output of other countries around the world, whose production is in turn dependent on the output of still other nations, and so on. We can\u2019t successfully put American companies back to work unless other countries simultaneously do the same with their domestic industries.</p> <p>Production of US automobiles, for example, simply won\u2019t be feasible until <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/2020/03/06/coronavirus-covid-auto-parts-supply-chain-china/4964022002/\">nations that produce required components</a> also reopen. And if US automakers can\u2019t source the materials they need for domestic production, related service companies \u2013 like marketing firms \u2013 won\u2019t have much work, either. If marketing companies have little to market, online advertising giants such as Google and Facebook will in turn see limited revenues.</p> <p>Our global economy is remarkably <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/sti/ind/global-value-chains.htm\">interconnected</a>. Pull out an important thread, and the whole tapestry of our production system <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-20/a-covid-19-supply-chain-shock-born-in-china-is-going-global\">unravels</a>.</p> <p>This economic interdependence necessitates all parts working in harmony. Unfortunately, the pandemic is asynchronous \u2013 it hits countries at different times with different rates of growth and severity. While China is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-autos-parts/as-one-of-chinas-detroits-reopens-worlds-automakers-worry-about-disruptions-idUSKBN20V14J\">reopening</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-52024239\">India</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/opinion/coronavirus-trump-lockdown.html\">US</a> are shuttering. If portions of Chinese production require unavailable intermediate goods from India or the US, such production won\u2019t be possible. Even if China can produce items for export, if their normal buyers in the US are closed, who will they sell to? And what happens when China \u2013 still <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/chinas-premier-warns-local-officials-not-to-cover-up-new-covid-19-cases-as-hubei-reopens\">lacking herd immunity</a> \u2013 needs to close its economy again right when India or the US are looking to reopen and use Chinese inputs?</p> <p>The staggered nature of the virus outbreak coupled with worldwide production presents a <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2020/simchi-levi-supply-chain-covid-19-0325\">remarkable</a> \u2013 and quite possibly insurmountable \u2013 global coordination problem. Globalized on-demand supply chains simply aren\u2019t well suited for a worldwide pandemic.</p> <h2><strong>Political hurdles</strong></h2> <p>The economic argument for reopening US production assumes that it would be broadly socially acceptable to sacrifice the lives of Americans to save our economy \u2013 and that politicians will therefore be willing to pursue it. We suspect, to the contrary, that premature reopening will soon be revealed as political suicide.</p> <p>Once the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-12/grim-toll-of-virus-deaths-will-get-worse-even-as-outbreak-wanes\">lag in deaths</a> catches up to the exponentially increasing number of cases in the US, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2020/03/24/covid-19-italian-priest-who-donated-his-ventilator-has-reportedly-died/2906351001/\">myriad</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/us/coronavirus-deaths-united-states.html\">heart-wrenching</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/nyregion/coronavirus-death-brooklyn-school-principal.html\">stories</a> of <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/coronavirus-georgia-mom-who-worked-hospital-found-dead-home-her-n1168386\">the</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/uk-woman-21-with-no-health-issues-dies-from-covid-19-family-say\">lives</a> of those lost will ensue. And while the economy certainly <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=yrh9DwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA247&amp;dq=economic+voting+review&amp;ots=asQMEDnkkC&amp;sig=m2GUFVMsIXYzaxPKVyYXl1JuYxw#v=onepage&amp;q=economic%20voting%20review&amp;f=false\">matters</a> to voters, we suspect that any politician that wants to win re-election is highly unlikely to push workers back to offices and factories while <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/coronavirus-obituaries-bergamo-italy/2020/03/16/6c342f02-66c7-11ea-b199-3a9799c54512_story.html\">obituaries are overflowing</a> and we\u2019re <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/24/europe/spain-ice-rink-morgue-coronavirus-intl/index.html\">using skating rinks</a> to store our dead.

Before the virus arrives, it can seem abstract, distant and even unthreatening to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/world/asia/coronavirus-risk-interpreter.html\">an</a> <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762386\">uncritical</a> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-02-28/coronavirus-panic-caused-by-probability-neglect\">or</a> <a href=\"https://qz.com/1812664/the-psychology-of-coronavirus-fear-and-how-to-overcome-it/\">untrained</a> eye. Yet its speed and severity take many by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/coronavirus-italy-lessons-countries-crisis-information\">surprise</a> as it <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/23/820009377/italy-witnesses-relentless-rise-in-covid-19-deaths\">rapidly</a> runs through communities. The marked difference between expectations and reality exacts a heavy psychological toll.</p> <p>Once the coronavirus touches citizens\u2019 lives, they are quite <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bill-gates-on-trump-call-for-quick-end-to-lockdown-its-tough-to-tell-people-keep-going-to-restaurants-go-buy-new-houses-ignore-that-pile-of-bodies-over-in-the-corner-2020-03-24\">unlikely</a> to immediately switch back into status-quo behavior. Even if officials were to remove restrictions on movement and social gatherings, we suspect most people will continue to limit non-essential outings. How many residents of <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-they-call-it-the-apocalypse-inside-italys-hardest-hit-hospital-11960597\">Bergamo, Italy</a>, want to spend time in crowded shops or restaurants right now? Our guess is: very, very few. If you knew coronavirus was still ravaging your city, would you head out to the barber shop or go to a concert?</p> <p>Many normal activities, from the enjoyable to the mundane, now produce some level of anxiety. That association won\u2019t be undone overnight, and fear is a remarkably powerful deterrent to economic activity.</p> <p>So, should we restart our economy while the virus is still rapidly spreading? Regardless of whether it\u2019s a necessary evil or a terrible atrocity of an idea, we probably can\u2019t.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://nickobradovich.com/\">Dr Nick Obradovich</a> is a PhD political and data scientist who trained at UCSD, the Harvard Kennedy School, and the MIT Media Lab.

I loved reading what others are up to during their isolation.</p> <p>I am treating this time at home as a chance to do all the things I complain I don\u2019t have the time to do. Morning to lunchtime is tidying, a little exercise, a bit of work.</p> <p>Lunch is a short walk, and watching something I never get round to watching on telly. One episode only. The afternoon is for hobbies. I have written a list and hung it on the wall to remind myself of all the choices I have. Eg, sitting down to regular practice sessions with my piano and ukelele, sorting photographs, making a scrapbook with the boxes of tickets and postcards I\u2019ve been collecting and hoarding. Getting the sewing machine out, with YouTube videos to hand, and mending or altering clothes. Listening to podcasts while also doing some mindfulness colouring, or Zentangle that I have newly discovered.</p> <p>Evening is cooking and TV with my husband like any regular evening, but maybe now we\u2019ll play some card games to shake it up. Making sure I get up early and go to bed at a reasonable time like I would for work is really important, I am trying really hard not to fall into the bad habits of late sleeping and hours of TV like I\u2019ve done in the past during periods of unemployment. Finding happiness in the benefits that this time at home is offering as well. Myself and my husband are very much enjoying not commuting, and I hope all your commuting readers are too.</p> </blockquote> <p>This sounds great, Roisin.

  "<p>Workington Asda is stripped of tinned marrowfat peas and rich tea biscuits, the online store says. No ETA on stocks, either. Cumbria is prepping. I ponder the merits of tinned mushy peas instead \u2013 always a touch tasteless \u2013 then wonder if I can placate with fig rolls. My mother, in her 80s, is being guarded like a rare Faberg\u00e9 egg, albeit a furious egg that finds this enforcement ridiculous. House arrest is a very strong term, but I am not above a rugby tackle. \u201cNo marrowfat peas in west Cumbria?\u201d she gasps down the phone.</p> <p>Now this is a dire situation. This week\u2019s column was meant to be about a jocund lunch at The <a href=\"https://www.dorchestercollection.com/en/london/the-dorchester/restaurants-bars/the-grill-at-the-dorchester\">Dorchester</a> Grill in Mayfair. Oh, wasn\u2019t the lobster thermidor tart delicious? Boy, life came at me fast.</p> <p>It came for millions and millions of people, now bombarding supermarket online sites and hoping, praying, for a delivery slot. Each time I try to amend the order, the website falls over, punch-drunk and exhausted. For a few terrifying minutes, it flounders. Then it stands up again and refreshes, suggesting frozen petits pois and mint Viscounts as alternatives.</p> <p>Seven hundred people died in Italy today, another window on my laptop says. A whole generation is fading. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, they were probably all auld bodies,\u201d mother says. \u201cIt\u2019s done a lot of us buggers a favour.\u201d I check out her order quickly, adding some Cornettos, which we used to eat together in the 1970s when the ice-cream van came before Corrie. My order being accepted is a tiny glint of positivity in what has been a very odd day.</p> <p>Millions will be in my position right now, choosing groceries for the isolated. It\u2019s a delicate process. What we eat at home, behind closed doors, is personal. Our secret snacky peccadilloes do not bear scrutiny. When I was young enough to work at the Guardian Guide, we once covered our go-to TV dinners; my love of cheap tinned soup with marge-slathered Ryvita and mini pickled onions was shameful to admit.</p> <p>Similarly, it takes days of gentle questioning to reveal the things the isolated actually want, once they\u2019ve got over refusing help or being grateful. \u201cA jar of beetroot, sliced, not whole,\u201d she says eventually. \u201cSome microwave meals for the freezer, but none with fish. Heinz chicken noodle soup, but not cream of chicken.\u201d \u201cNo fish,\u201d I write on my whiteboard, where, via columns of to-do lists, I aim to ride out this planetary blip.</p> <p>I began gathering three weeks ago, in tiny stages, surreptitiously, ashamed of being seen as dramatic. Some chickpeas here, some rice pudding there. I bought these as they quarantined Lombardy. By the time they closed Spain, I was shredding and freezing spring greens and putting individual anchovies in ice-cube trays, which felt incredibly proactive but was, I know now, merely displacement activity. \u201cI\u2019ve never really liked fish,\u201d my mother tells me on one of our now twice-daily phone calls. \u201cBut I do like sardines in tomato sauce.\u201d This is totally new information. What else do I not know about her?</p> <p>When the madness passes, which it will, because all things do, I hope we remember how the supermarket staff really served us. It\u2019s ironic how many of us slagged off these places for decades, told the masses to avoid them.

Forever touching the screens we\u2019ve just touched, keeping the queues moving and, by default, breathing in our germs. As shoppers ransacked the pasta and fought over UHT, they had no time to plan for their own families or to watch rolling news or to think too hard if their sweat was the mark of hard work or a fever. I would hug, if I could, the team at my Sainsbury\u2019s Local, who open at dawn every day, always jolly, with the shelves restocked with small amounts of almost all vital items. I\u2019m especially indebted to the drivers whom I\u2019m trusting to get to my mother. They\u2019re taking up the slack on what is now my biggest life problem. I\u2019m trusting total strangers to feed her, not upset her, not frighten her, to keep their distance and to leave the boxes somewhere handy. And to explain to her why there are no rich teas. I wouldn\u2019t call that job unskilled at all.</p>",
  "<p>Netflix was supposed to be the great democratizer. The streaming platform\u2019s most ardent fans have argued in its favor as a level playing field, instantaneously providing a global audience of millions to smaller independent films that would otherwise never reach them. Critics of the service\u2019s business model have posited that dropping little-known films into such a vast library with little-to-no marketing or promotion would damn those titles to an obscurity even more severe. Just one of the cases in point for the latter school of thought: The World Is Yours by Romain Gavras, a sly crime comedy that Netflix acquired for the US after a positive premiere at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival, then allowed to languish for six months before unceremoniously dumping it into the unending sea of content (it\u2019s available on Amazon Prime in the UK). The release hardly made a blip that December, and in the year-and-change since, its reputation hasn\u2019t grown much.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/25/the-shining-ive-never-seen-kubrick\">I've never seen \u2026\u00a0The Shining</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s a grave injustice that should be easily remedied, seeing as Gavras follows in a popular tradition of roundly, generously enjoyable gangster mischief. There\u2019s a little Scorsese and a little Ritchie in his fleet-footed stylizing, which whisks audiences through a caper and its attendant double-crosses with a roving, restless camera. Gavras comes from the world of music videos (he directed the nine-minute clip for M.I.A.\u2019s Born Free, in which riot troopers carry out a genocide against redheads), and applies many of the same techniques to long-form narrative. But where many talents making that creative migration in the past have hidden behind slow-mo, format changes and other slickness \u2013 \u201clike a music video\u201d still gets the occasional workout as a stock critical diss \u2013 Gavras folds it all into a story with the substance to justify its sumptuous flash.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZqfRKKZYfc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AZqfRKKZYfc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Kind and merciful, Far\u00e8s (Karim Leklou, his round face perfectly non-threatening) doesn\u2019t belong in the criminal demimonde, and he knows it.

She\u2019s just one of the unstable quantities trifling with Far\u00e8s\u2019s plan, an ensemble including an Illuminati conspiracy-monger, a rage-prone Scotsman, his eight-year-old daughter and a pair of trigger-happy idiots with Tony Montana fantasies that lend the film its title. You know at least part of the drill; no one can be trusted, things go wrong and yet there\u2019s something unexpected and satisfying about who gets to clinch their happy ending, and how.</p> <p>A spiky political subtext also sneaks up on a viewer while they\u2019re busy chuckling at the gallows humor. (The aforementioned morons get the bleakest laugh when one imagines killing their boss and retiring in luxury together, then the other immediately envisions the same scenario frame by frame, except he also shoots his partner and keeps the loot for himself.) Much of Far\u00e8s\u2019s scheme hinges on the xenophobia against Muslims and African immigrants currently festering in France and Spain. The climactic heist plays something like a well-told joke, its punchline being that the gang-averse Spanish police can be readily manipulated into action with even the faintest whiff of terrorist activity.</p> <p>In another world, this would be something of an event on the international cinema circuit, between its high-wattage cast (Adjani and co-star Vincent Cassel rank as two of the bigger names in France\u2019s industry) and Gavras\u2019s instinct for crowd-pleasing. He does everything bombastically; he likes musical interludes, whether that\u2019s a karaoke rendition of Toto\u2019s Africa or clutch soundtracking from the of-the-moment electronic virtuoso Jamie xx. His major set pieces \u2013 a boatjacking that ends in flame, a bomb scare at a water park \u2013 have a zest and ambition absent from many film-makers of his relative greenness. It\u2019s just the sort of hidden treasure an adventurous watcher would\u2019ve once picked up at a video store, or wandered into at an arthouse theater. It\u2019s much harder to stumble upon in the endless scroll of the streaming format; until a better system devises itself, we\u2019ll have to pick up the slack of spreading the word.</p> <ul> <li><p>The World Is Yours is available on Netflix in the US and Amazon Prime in the UK</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>In the 1980s, my father wrote a guide, <em>Writers in Sussex</em>, for which I took the photographs. During our research we visited the former homes of 40 or so writers.

Peake is buried nearby, his gravestone inscribed with a moving line from one of his poems: \u201cTo live at all is miracle enough.\u201d</p> <p>Sadly some of the houses have now gone. One of those is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/05/a-room-of-ones-own-writers-virginia-woolf-creativity\" title=\"\">Asheham House, near Beddingham, which Virginia and Leonard Woolf</a> rented in 1912, before they bought Monk\u2019s House, in nearby Rodmell, in 1919. Leonard aptly described it as \u201cromantic, gentle, melancholy, lovely\u201d. When we visited in the autumn, the trees around this remote and austerely beautiful house, with its elegant Gothic windows, were bare and echoing with the raucous calls of rooks. Locals had told Virginia that Asheham was haunted and it became the subject of her story \u201cThe Haunted House\u201d.</p> <p>Woolf\u2019s biographer, Hermione Lee, visited Asheham in 1993, the year before it was demolished. By then it was deserted and boarded up and she \u201csnuffed up the atmosphere of silence, decay, and forlorn beauty\u201d. Lee admits that of all Woolf\u2019s homes, this is the one that \u201chaunts me most\u201d.</p> <p>Together with her fellow life-writer Kate Kennedy, Lee has co-edited a rich and eclectic collection of essays about the role houses play in people\u2019s lives and our fascination with the homes of our creative heroes. As a biographer, Lee knows that \u201cthe writing of lives often involves writing houses\u201d.</p> <p>The description of a house can vividly reveal the experience of childhood or the story of a relationship: \u201cHow a house is lived in can tell you everything you need to know about people, whether it\u2019s the choice of wallpaper, the mess in the kitchen, the silence or shouting over meals, doors left open or closed, a fire burning in the hearth\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The description of a house can vividly reveal the experience of childhood or the story of a relationship</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>With contributions from poets, archaeologists, historians, novelists and museum curators, <em>Lives of Houses</em> focuses on \u201cmen and women who have shaped and recorded the history of their houses through their own work\u201d.

Our motivation is often confused: \u201ca mixture of awe, longing, desire for inwardness, and intrusive curiosity\u201d. Indeed, the reality is often deeply disappointing, as Keats discovered when visiting the birthplace of Robert Burns: \u201cO the flummery of a birth place! Cant! Cant! Cant!\u201d</p> <p> Although most current owners are welcoming and even proud of the literary associations of their homes, some are not. When Lee visited Talland House in Cornwall \u2013 Woolf\u2019s much-loved childhood summer house \u2013 the then owner was far from pleased to see yet another of the novelist\u2019s acolytes on his doorstep. He told her that when he bought the house he had \u201cnever heard of the bloody woman\u201d. Now, he complained, \u201cevery time you turn round, there are Americans in the living room! Australians in the bathroom!\u201d</p> <p>The fascination with the homes of literary and other luminaries is not new. Robert Douglas-Fairhurst describes how in the late 19th century there was an atmosphere of \u201cliterary stalking and door-stepping\u201d from which the Poet Laureate, Alfred Lord Tennyson, suffered more than most. On one of his regular walks he took flight at the sight of what he thought was a crowd of fans advancing on him, only to discover it was in fact a flock of sheep. But even Tennyson was not immune from the fascination, and once visited the \u201clow dark room\u201d that had been Goethe\u2019s \u201csacred study\u201d. In his poetry however, he rebelled against the sentimental Victorian idea of home, and Douglas-Fairhurst detects a desire to \u201cwrite poems that stop us feeling too much at home\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/gallery/2015/may/04/temples-of-literature-writers-houses-in-pictures\">Temples of literature: writers' houses \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In her essay, Elleke Boehmer looks beyond conventional ideas about \u201cplace, home, writing and belonging\u201d. For a time in 1976, after his rustication from New College for various misdemeanours, the Zimbabwean writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/jan/07/survey-short-story-dambudzo-marechera\" title=\"\">Dambudzo Marechera</a> lived in a tent beside the Thames on Oxford\u2019s Port Meadow. It was in this bucolic setting that Marechera, a \u201cthin young black man, his hair in short spirals, sitting cross-legged within the tent\u2019s open flap\u201d, typed drafts of the stories that became <em>The House of Hunger</em> (1978), for which he won the Guardian fiction prize. A migrant author who became one of Zimbabwe\u2019s greatest post-independence writers, Marechera was \u201chomeless both actually and in terms of a national tradition to call his own\u201d, reshaping the landscape of African literature with his \u201csophisticated, intertextual, wayward\u201d writing.</p> <p>WB Yeats only ever owned one house outright: the tower house at Ballylee, near Gort, County Galway. Yeats described it as an \u201cold square castle\u201d. It was derelict, with no roof and prone to flooding. But his poetic education had been full of towers in which lonely scholars wrote by candlelight and where, as Roy Foster says, \u201ctragic princesses were immured\u201d. Ezra Pound scorned such romantic notions, describing it as a \u201cphallic symbol on the bogs \u2013 Ballyphallus or whatever he calls it with a river on the first floor\u201d.</p> <p>Yeats bought it in May 1917, together with two cottages and some land, for \u00a335. The restoration of his \u201cCastle\u201d took several years and he loved the process of using historic materials. His 1928 collection, <em>The Tower</em>, has an exquisite illustration of it on the cover by Sturge Moore. This Romantic tower-house \u201cinspired some of Yeats\u2019s greatest poems\u201d, allowing him to explore his \u201crelation to the violent past and the unknown future\u201d. Declared a National Monument in the 1960s, Seamus Heaney called it \u201ca sacramental site\u201d. Still prone to flooding, it is, Foster says, \u201cas atmospheric as ever\u201d, and a potent monument to Yeats\u2019s unique sensibility.</p> <p>In this collection there are two wonderful pieces on WH Auden. The first is by Seamus Perry on Auden\u2019s New York apartment, at 77 St Mark\u2019s Place on the Lower East Side, to which he moved with his partner Chester Kallman in February 1954. He stayed there until 1972, \u201cmaking it his longest single habitation\u201d. The chaos in which Auden lived was famous. A friend recalled his rooms being littered with \u201cempty bottles, used martini glasses, books, papers, phonograph records\u201d. Stravinsky once said \u201che is the dirtiest man I have ever liked\u201d. When Edmund Wilson reproached him for this, Auden responded: \u201cI hate living in squalor \u2013 I detest it! \u2013 but I can\u2019t do the work I want to do and live any other way.\u201d</p> <p>In 1958, Auden bought a house (the only one he ever owned) in the sleepy and provincial Austrian village of Kirchstetten. His decision to do so was, Sandra Mayer says, \u201cone of the quirkier turns in literary history\u201d. He spent the last 15 summers of his life there. It was \u201can environment that must have seemed both mind-bogglingly alien and alienating\u201d. Yet Auden felt at home in this unlikely location, an hour from Vienna in his yellow VW Beetle (once used by one of his lovers in a series of robberies). Although he attended Catholic Sunday mass, he did not try to fit into village life. But the villagers respected \u201cHerr Professor\u201d and turned a blind eye to his and Kallman\u2019s lifestyle \u201cwhich included regular visits from Greek boyfriends, Viennese rent boys, and petty criminals\u201d.</p> <p>The sequence of poems \u201cThanksgiving for a Habitat\u201d, included in his 1965 collection <em>About the House</em>, explores each room of the house, from the study to the privy. In it Auden revealed that finding a house that unexpectedly became a home occasionally moved him to \u201ctears of gratitude and surprise\u201d: \u201cWhat I dared not hope or fight for / is, in my fifties, mine: a toft-and-croft / where I needn\u2019t, ever, be at home to / those I am not at home with.\u201d Now his house at Hinterholz 6 is owned by the community and is a museum to Auden, drawing visitors from around the world to see where he composed his poems.</p> <p>In his study \u2013 or \u201cCave of Making\u201d, as he called it \u2013 is his Olivetti Portable and a letter by him to the Austrian tax authorities, \u201cwhich is really a veiled theory of poetry and reveals Auden\u2019s sharp intellect and brittle humour\u201d. Auden is buried near the home he loved, his grave marked by a simple iron cross and a plaque: \u201cW. H.

Here we are again, on this final Saturday in September, readying ourselves for the final game of the decade \u2013 the grand final. The last match to be played under the banner of the Victorian Football League before the brave new world of the AFL arrives in 1990. And what better way to celebrate this golden era of Australian rules than the most dominant team of the decade, Hawthorn, taking on the highest-scoring outfit in the competition, Geelong?</p> <p>For the Hawks, it is their seventh big one in a row. With champions on every line, they know all there is about winning premierships. If they can get the job done today, it will be their fourth of the 1980s and deliver the family club back-to-back success for the first time. If it possible to mean any more, it does because Allan Jeans is at the helm today, the man who coached the 1983 and 1986 triumphs but wasn\u2019t there when they flogged Melbourne in last year\u2019s decider, that season spent recovering from a brain injury. The players love the man they call Yabby.</p> <p>Where all but two Hawthorn players turning out today have been there as winners before, the opposite is true of Geelong \u2013 none of their 20 have played in a grand final. And where Hawthorn breezed through September, taking care of Essendon by six goals in the second semi at VFL Park to qualify after a week off, the Cats are playing in their fourth final in four weeks after a long, wet season. But boy, they know how to kick a score; no team has kicked so many goals in one season. And Gary Ablett, the enigmatic powerhouse, kicked seven against Melbourne to get through the first semi with easy before going one better to annihilate Essendon in the preliminary final last week \u2013 a 94-point victory. </p> <p>Only once before have these clubs played off in the grand final, back in 1963 when Bobby Davis\u2019s men stormed home to claim their sixth cup. They haven\u2019t added to their trophy cabinet since, though \u2013 the Sleepy Hollow faithful have been waiting so patiently for this day. Under Malcolm Blight, who took over as coach for this season, they have played a brilliant brand of high-scoring football. </p> <p>The main question in the build up bas been whether the Cats can roll that out against such a formidable opponent. In addition to all that aforementioned experience \u2013 also having finished two games clear on top of the ladder dropping just three home-and-away games \u2013 they broke Geelong\u2019s heart in round six when coming back from a 49-point deficit to run over them in a Princes Park classic. </p> <p>There was plenty of spite in that affair too, not least when Dermott Brereton made a mess of Mark Yeates\u2019 groin and told him all about it. Don\u2019t doubt for a moment that, in addition to being a high-scoring grand final, this will be a mightily physical encounter as well. I absolutely cannot wait. Welcome to the Melbourne Cricket Ground for our goal-by-goal coverage of the day that matters most.</p> </div>   </div>",
  "<p>If the first casualty of war is truth, the second may very well be something the entire world values highly right now: healthcare.</p> <p>Families fleeing conflict, or currently in its crosshairs, know that medical assistance is a rare and precious privilege in war zones. Amid the terror of bombs and bullets, a functioning medical facility is a life-saving oasis, but it\u2019s a near certainty medical staff will be overworked and short on supplies.</p> <p>This lack of medical care is what makes Covid-19\u2019s inexorable march into conflict zones so terrifying: it\u2019s a dramatic threat to life in places where people are often seen as nameless, faceless others.

Today, helping those least able to defend themselves from disease is a moral and political imperative, even \u2013 or especially \u2013 during the crippling societal and economic effects of a global health crisis.

In the medical facilities we support in countries such as Syria, Somalia and Iraq, we are increasing stocks of essential supplies and reinforcing infection prevention and control measures.</p> <p>In detention facilities in more than 50 countries, the ICRC works with the authorities to strengthen medical screenings and prevention measures for new arrivals, visitors, guards and delivery personnel. We also support disinfection measures and distribute hygiene materials. We have seen such measures prevent the spread of cholera and Ebola into places of detention in Guinea, Liberia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We must do the same with Covid-19.</p> <p>These are critical steps right now. But here is another critical step: the ICRC and others must continue to carry out non-Covid-19 work. For example, the hospitals we support in South Sudan have received more than 145 patients with gunshot wounds in recent weeks. They must be helped, too.</p> <p>The sad reality is that for people in conflict, Covid-19 may just be one additional mortal threat.

  "<p>An Iranian scientist who was exonerated in a US sanctions trial but remains jailed by immigration authorities said the conditions in detention were filthy and overcrowded \u2013 and officials were doing little to prevent a deadly coronavirus outbreak.</p> <p>Dr Sirous Asgari, a materials science and engineering professor, was <a href=\"https://www.cleveland.com/court-justice/2019/11/cleveland-federal-judge-dismisses-trade-secrets-fraud-charges-against-iranian-professor-during-trial.html\">acquitted</a> in November on federal charges of stealing trade secrets related to his academic work with a university in Ohio. Although the US government lost its case on all charges, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) has kept him indefinitely detained since the trial. Now he\u2019s speaking out about the \u201cinhumane\u201d treatment that could cost him his life.</p> <p>Asgari, 59, told the Guardian that his Ice holding facility in Alexandria, Louisiana, had no basic cleaning practices in place and continued to bring in new detainees from across the country with no strategy to minimize the threat of Covid-19.</p> <p>In a phone call from the Alexandria Staging Facility (ASF), he said he believed the only safe option would be to shut down the facility due to the deplorable conditions. ASF is a 400-bed site where people are supposed to be detained for no more than 72 hours, typically a final stop before they are deported. But with Covid-19 travel restrictions and flight cancellations, Ice has been holding people for days on end in cramped bunkbeds alongside new arrivals who may have been exposed to the virus.</p> <p>Asgari arrived at ASF on 10 March and has been seeking to voluntarily \u201cself deport\u201d to Iran. Ice has refused to let him fly home or be temporarily released with his family in the US. He alleged:</p> <ul> <li><p>Detainees have no hand sanitizer, and the facility is not regularly cleaning bathrooms or sleeping areas. Asgari and a few other detainees have devised a schedule to try to clean surfaces themselves with the minimal soap available.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>Detainees lack access to masks. For two weeks, ASF also refused to let Asgari wear his own protective mask, which he brought with him to the facility, and it has refused to supply one, despite his history of serious respiratory problems.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>Detainees struggle to stay clean, and the facility has an awful stench. Because the facility is supposed to be temporary, there is no laundry available and detainees are stuck with the clothes they were wearing upon arrival, sometimes after long journeys.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>There are no physical distancing guidelines at the facility. It appears no procedures or practices have changed in response to Covid-19 since Asgari\u2019s arrival, even as Louisiana state and federal officials have urged people to isolate.</p></li> </ul> <p>\u201cThe way Ice looks at these people is not like they are human beings, but are objects to get rid of,\u201d said Asgari, a professor at the Sharif University of Technology, a public university in Tehran. \u201cThe way that they have been treating us is absolutely terrifying.

He arrived in the US in 2017 with his wife and with valid passports and visas but upon arrival discovered he was being prosecuted by the US government for alleged violations of sanctions law.</p> <p>Asgari, a father of three, has deep ties to the US. He completed his materials engineering PhD at Drexel University in Pennsylvania, and two of his children live in the US. But the FBI surveilled him and ultimately he was charged with fraud and trade secret theft relating to his work with a university in Ohio.</p> <p>During a long trial, Asgari won his case and was acquitted in November 2019, with a judge ruling the government\u2019s evidence was insufficient.

The professor said the conditions at the facility were unbearable for long-term stays. New detainees are brought in at all hours, meaning it\u2019s impossible to get sleep in his pod, where there can be up to 100 people in bunk beds in a single room. He puts toilet paper in his ears but has struggled to get any rest and now has a sleep disorder.</p> <p>Asgari said there was not enough food.

Bolsonaro has repeatedly dismissed the illness as a fantasy and media \u201chysteria\u201d.<br></p> \n  <p>However, despite Lula\u2019s call for impeachment, political specialists believe most members of the opposition oppose such an attempt to unseat Brazil\u2019s far-right president fearing - as was the case in the United States with Donald Trump - that it would allow him to pose as the victim of a political conspiracy.</p> \n  <p>In an article published earlier this week the Brazilian commentator and former communications minister Thomas Traumann said many Bolsonaro opponents believed it was better to let Bolsonaro destroy his political career by himself.</p> \n  <p>\u201cNever interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake,\u201d he wrote, quoting Napoleon Bonaparte.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-26T12:34:04.162Z\">at 12.34pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7c9a218f08af215f6fb9ed\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jennifer-rankin\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-26T12:06:02.646Z\">12.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>European Union</strong> member states have been rebuked by Brussels for only \u201clooking out for themselves\u201d in the early phases of the coronavirus crisis.</p> \n  <p>Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the European commission, told the European parliament that too many countries had failed to help their neighbours when the virus first struck Europe.

It came as Russia posted record growth for confirmed coronavirus cases for the second day in a row. Russia now has 840 cases, a rise of 182 in 24 hours. The Kremlin has halted all international air traffic, both for airlines and charter flights, excluding flights repatriating Russian citizens to the country.</p> \n  <p><strong>US deaths exceed 1,000 as Senate approves $2.2tn package</strong></p> \n  <p>US deaths from the coronavirus pandemic have topped 1,000. Worldwide, the death toll climbed past 21,000, according to a running count kept by Johns Hopkins University, and the US had 1,046 deaths and nearly 70,000 infections.

The plan also provides $130bn to hospitals, and expands unemployment insurance.</p> \n  <p><strong>Senators overwhelmingly voted to pass the legislation, approving it 96-0.</strong></p> \n  <p>The House is expected to vote on the bill on Friday. \u201cWe are working to ensure that those who are unable to return to Washington will be able to express their views on this legislation remotely,\u201d said the House leader Steny Hoyer in a statement.</p> \n  <p>Lawmakers scrambled on Wednesday to smooth over snags as they rushed to pass the legislation, which provides direct payments to American families, and loans and grants to businesses. A last-minute amendment, from Republican senators who complained that the bill would incentivize workers to collect unemployment payments rather than take a job, failed.</p> \n  <p>After casting her vote Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat of Massachusetts, said: \u201cThis is not the bill I wanted, but its immediate investments are vital.\u201d \u201cThey are also insufficient,\u201d she added. \u201cWe will need to do more \u2013 and soon.\u201d</p> \n  <p>McConnell similarly reflected on the compromises that Republicans and Democrats made to arrive at the deal. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long, hard road, with a remarkable number of twists and turns,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for the sake of millions of Americans, it will be worth it. It will be worth it to get help to millions of small businesses and save tens of millions of jobs.\u201d</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/senate-passes-coronavirus-stimulus-package\">US Senate passes historic $2tn relief package as coronavirus devastates economy</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-26T03:57:09.372Z\">at 3.57am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7c27148f08af215f6fb69d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-26T03:53:23.661Z\">3.53am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>CNN reports the vote is 96-0, with four senators absent but nobody opposed. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1243022358539091968\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BREAKING?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BREAKING</a>: After a furious partisan fight and days of hard-fought talks, the Senate comes together amid a coronavirus crisis gripping the country and fears of an economic recession, clears rescue package 96-0. \u201cThis is a proud moment for the United States Senate,\u201d McConnell said</p>\u2014 Manu Raju (@mkraju) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1243022358539091968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 26, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7c26778f08af215f6fb698\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-26T03:50:24.102Z\">3.50am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/cspan/status/1243018122556211200\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Senate Clerk: \"No Senator voted in the negative.\" <a href=\"https://t.co/0TwOZFsUxb\">pic.twitter.com/0TwOZFsUxb</a></p>\u2014 CSPAN (@cspan) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cspan/status/1243018122556211200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 26, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7c24f68f0878a2a48aa5fb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-26T03:44:44.884Z\">3.44am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>House members will attempt to approve the package on Friday over the phone. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7c23f68f0878a2a48aa5f7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-26T03:42:12.058Z\">3.42am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Senate majority leader McConnell is speaking in the press gallery now.</p> \n  <p>Voting isn\u2019t quite done \u2013 there are only 95 senators present \u2013 but McConnell says <b>the package has been passed unopposed. </b></p> \n  <p>The gavel has not come down yet.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-26T06:33:22.475Z\">at 6.33am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7c233a8f081e5eda236ec2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-26T03:36:43.550Z\">3.36am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The US Senate vote comes as coronavirus-related deaths in the US pass 1,000. </p> \n  <p>Confirmed infections are also rapidly increasing: </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1242961154793750528\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Increase over yesterday in detected coronavirus cases.

  "<p>I want to talk to Mark Manson about intimacy, a recurring theme throughout the blogger-turned-author\u2019s new Audible Original audiobook, Love Is Not Enough. But the three publicists listening in on our call (another sent her apologies) are killing my vibe. I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019re here because of tightened security, put down to Manson\u2019s obscene level of authorial success (his 2016 book The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck has sold more than 10m copies) or if everyone is so enthralled by his wisdom that to sit in is an opportunity too good to pass up.</p> <p>\u201cThank you all for gathering,\u201d one says. Also, \u201cPretend like we\u2019re not even here.\u201d</p> <p>Maybe it\u2019s a deliberate and ingenious metaphor for the blockages that we install in our romantic relationships. After all, the five interviewees that populate Manson\u2019s audiobook have a habit of seeking out shadowy partners \u2013 be they adulterous, narcissistic or just remote \u2013 or they fantasise or self-medicate themselves to a safe distance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/14/love-at-first-sight-narcissism\">Struck dumb: why love at first sight is just another kind of narcissism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s Manson\u2019s mission to reach those who are terrified of intimacy but who are turned cold by traditional self-help speak; hence his penchant for tough-love titles. Like that of The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck. Its hi-vis orange cover was hardly necessary \u2013 the book seemed to be the most popular accessory of the year. The 2019 follow-up, Everything is F*cked: A Book About Hope, was packed with the same kind of no-frills insights.</p> <p>The Love Is Not Enough audiobook is a return to older territory. Manson started his brand almost by accident in his 20s, when \u2013 inspired by Neil Strauss\u2019s 2005 book The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists \u2013 he started posting tips on PUA (that\u2019s pickup artist) forums. Finding popularity in that, he moved into dating coaching through the site Practical Pickup.</p> <p>\u201cThe online life coaching was a new, exciting thing that was happening on the internet,\u201d he tells Guardian Australia. \u201cI was a young single guy, and so most of the people I was working with were young single people. It really wasn\u2019t until I got older and the audience got bigger that the scope of work expanded into relationships and marriages.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You can\u2019t help somebody if you\u2019re judging them</p> <footer> <cite>Mark Manson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 2010, after five years in the PUA space \u2013 which was increasingly getting a reputation for misogyny and even inciting violence against women \u2013 Manson made a public exit, and posted on his website a critique of The Game. He self-published the book Models: Attract Women Through Honesty in 2011, then pivoted into more general life guidance for men with the site Post Masculine.</p> <p>So Manson got out early \u2013 and gracefully. A few years later the more controversial PUA organisation Real Social Dynamics followed suit by deleting much of its pickup material and moving into self-development, but not before its founder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/11/pick-up-artists-women-targets-julien-blanc-desperate-men-uk-visa\">Julien Blanc, had his Australian visa revoked by Scott Morrison</a> after outcry at footage of him grabbing nonconsenting women. And by 2015 Strauss had written The Truth: An Uncomfortable Book About Relationships, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/10/neil-strauss-the-game-book-truth\">telling the Guardian that he felt \u201ca healthy sense of shame\u201d</a> about The Game.</p> <p>When asked if his change of heart was a 180 or a natural evolution, Manson says, \u201cEarly on, when I was writing dating advice, I was frustrated because I kept running up against the pickup artist stuff. I kept talking to these young guys who had read The Game and these other books, and were just going out and saying and doing the stupidest things. Finally, at some point, a bunch of people told me, \u2018You need to write the antidote to The Game.\u2019 And so that\u2019s that\u2019s where my self-published book came from.\u201d</p> <p>But the big transition didn\u2019t come until 2013, when Manson came to the conclusion that he was repeating himself and not digging deep enough.</p> <p>\u201cI realised that relationship problems don\u2019t happen in a vacuum,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t start dating a married man out of nowhere; there are self-esteem issues, there are identity issues, there are deep insecurities that translate over into other parts of your life. I wanted to start writing about psychology and personal development more broadly.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2e02c437e5c8e4b2f9ec6fd7d1875eba92407bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2e02c437e5c8e4b2f9ec6fd7d1875eba92407bf/0_0_1400_933/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Manson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Manson. \u2018I am willing to talk about my life but also I\u2019ve learned the lines that I won\u2019t cross.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He moved his business over to a self-titled, gender-neutral site. Three of his five interviewees in the audiobook are women. One, \u201cVanessa\u201d, he has alluded to already. She\u2019s a successful businesswoman seeing a married man. Vanessa\u2019s voice shakes in her interviews, maybe because the admission of an affair tends to whip up storms of incomparable outrage (as comments in response to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/01/i-had-an-affair-with-my-husband-but-he-has-now-betrayed-me-mariella-frostrup\">letters received by the Guardian\u2019s advice columnist Mariella Frostrup will testify</a>). But Manson joins the ranks of the therapist Esther Perel, who wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/28/esther-perel-the-relationship-guru-who-thinks-infidelity-isnt-all-bad\">The State of Affairs: Rethinking Infidelity</a> and the author Wednesday Martin, who wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/04/untrue-wednesday-martin-review\">Untrue</a>, in tackling the topic analytically.</p> <p>\u201cI was very conscious that you can\u2019t help somebody if you\u2019re judging them,\u201d he says, \u201cand I genuinely believe that the awful things we do in our relationships, we don\u2019t do them because we\u2019re evil or mean, we do them because we\u2019re scared or hurt.\u201d</p> <p>Thus he sees his role as getting to the bottom of that. We can hear the interviewees keen to discuss the minutiae of a situation, as if this is where the mystery lies. Instead, Manson dives beneath the surface, into the murkier waters of values, boundaries and fears. Sometimes, as he says, the stories wind up resolved and tied up in a neat bow; sometimes not.<br><br>Manson allows some transparency about his own life; in his books, in interviews, and also in his live shows, in which he\u2019ll perch informally on the edge of a stage, or sit cross-legged. He\u2019s avoided the cultivated guru look of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/27/mentors-russell-brand-review-grown-up-guru\">self-help star like Russell Brand;</a> no beards or beads here. In any case, Strauss defined that as \u201cpeacocking\u201d \u2013 wearing something outlandish to set you apart and provide an interesting talking point \u2013 which wouldn\u2019t do at all.</p> <p>Even so, I wonder how he avoids en masse \u201ctransference\u201d \u2013 the Freudian term for when someone projects their feelings for a parent on to their therapist.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/14/game-over-why-havent-dating-guides-woken-up-to-new-sexual-politics\">Game over: why haven't dating guides woken up to new sexual politics?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cPeople have this sense that they know me, like they\u2019re friends with me, so it\u2019s more like hanging around after the show and trying to go get a drink with me, or asking what hotel I\u2019m staying at and if I want to hang out,\u201d he says. \u201cOne thing I\u2019ve had to learn throughout my career is to manage that relationship with my audience and set boundaries. So I am transparent with the public [in that] I am willing to talk about my life but also I\u2019ve learned the lines that I won\u2019t cross.\u201d</p> <p>As we wind up, I mention the unavoidable fact that we\u2019re going through a global transition period, a time forcing us to accept and adapt. In The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, Manson wrote that everything positive has some associated sacrifice or cost. But might we feel under undue pressure to have some earth-shattering epiphany about our lives right now?</p> <p>\u201cI think epiphanies are overrated,\u201d he says. \u201cI think most of our important life changes are actually just a series of tiny 1% changes that compound over time. And then, instead of recognising all of the little decisions that added up to the big change, we just look back and invent the story for ourselves \u2013 \u2018Oh yeah, it was that one time where my dad got in the car accident that changed everything.\u2019 And that\u2019s very rarely the case.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022<em> <a href=\"https://www.audible.com.au/pd/Love-Is-Not-Enough-Audiobook/B084NZBQBZ\">Love Is Not Enough by Mark Manson</a> is out now through Audible Originals</em></p>"
