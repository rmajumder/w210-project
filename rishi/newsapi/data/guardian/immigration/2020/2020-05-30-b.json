  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Pope begs world leaders to provide coronavirus relief</h2> <p>Pope Francis<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/30/coronavirus-live-news-trump-us-quitting-who-brazil-russia-iran-australia-uk-outbreak?page=with:block-5ed2b1518f087122eca528f3#block-5ed2b1518f087122eca528f3\">implored world leaders on Saturday</a> to act wisely and generously to provide social and economic relief for the many workers who have lost jobs, and called for the enormous sums of money used to grow and perfect armaments to instead be used to fund research to prevent similar catastrophes in the future.</p> <h2>Top health scientists blame British PM\u2019s chief adviser for losing public trust</h2> <p>Britain\u2019s top public health leaders and scientists have warned the prime minister, Boris Johnson, that trust in the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/30/dominic-cummings-has-broken-covid-19-policy-trust-say-top-scientists\">has been shattered by the Dominic Cummings affair</a> and this now poses real danger to life when lockdown measures are lifted this week. Johnson\u2019s top aide has been embroiled in a scandal after he was seen in Durham, 264 miles from his London home, despite having had coronavirus symptoms.</p> <p>An <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/30/tory-poll-lead-collapses-as-voters-say-cummings-should-go\">Opinium poll for the Observer</a>&nbsp;shows 81% of people believe Cummings broke the lockdown rules, and 68%, including 52% of Conservative supporters, think he should resign. The poll also shows the Tories\u2019 lead over Labour has crashed from 26 points at the end of March to just four points now.</p> <h2>Romania\u2019s PM pays fine for breaching own Covid-19 rules</h2> <p>Romania\u2019s prime minister, Ludovic Orban, paid a 3,000 lei fine ($687/\u00a3556) on Saturday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/30/coronavirus-live-news-trump-us-quitting-who-brazil-russia-iran-australia-uk-outbreak?page=with:block-5ed2ba5a8f087122eca52913#block-5ed2ba5a8f087122eca52913\">for breaking his own coronavirus restrictions</a> by not wearing a face mask and smoking indoors. A picture which went viral on social media shows Orban in his office, sitting around a table with several other cabinet members, smoking a cigarette while none of them wore masks.</p> <h2>Russia to start vaccine trial within two weeks</h2> <p>Russian scientists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/30/coronavirus-live-news-trump-us-quitting-who-brazil-russia-iran-australia-uk-outbreak?page=with:block-5ed2b7518f08f5e3730118f2#block-5ed2b7518f08f5e3730118f2\">plan to start clinical trials within two weeks</a> on a vaccine to combat coronavirus, the health minister was quoted as saying on Saturday as authorities approved the country\u2019s first anti-Covid-19 drug, Avifavir.</p> <h2>Greece to test arrivals coming from EU\u2019s high-risk airports</h2> <p>Greece <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/30/coronavirus-live-news-trump-us-quitting-who-brazil-russia-iran-australia-uk-outbreak?page=with:block-5ed2b4e98f08f5e3730118ec#block-5ed2b4e98f08f5e3730118ec\">will conduct coronavirus tests</a> on visitors arriving from airports deemed high-risk by the European Union\u2019s aviation safety agency, EASA, when it opens its airports to tourism traffic on 15 June. EASA regularly updates a list of airports located in affected areas with high risk of coronavirus transmission, which include 13 in the UK, all airports in 22 US states, and those in the Ile de France region surrounding Paris.</p> <h2>Mexican healthcare workers to protest for better protection</h2> <p>Frontline workers in Mexico City\u2019s hospitals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/30/coronavirus-live-news-trump-us-quitting-who-brazil-russia-iran-australia-uk-outbreak?page=with:block-5ed2d9cf8f084df971c8cc0b#block-5ed2d9cf8f084df971c8cc0b\">are planning a national march</a> on Monday to demand appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). Nurses and other health workers account for about a quarter of all of Mexico\u2019s coronavirus infections, government data shows, one of the highest rates in the world.</p> <h2>South Africa\u2019s infection cases top 30,000</h2> <p>The country\u2019s detected coronavirus infections <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/30/coronavirus-live-news-trump-us-quitting-who-brazil-russia-iran-australia-uk-outbreak?page=with:block-5ed2be3f8f087122eca52924#block-5ed2be3f8f087122eca52924\">now exceed 30,000</a>, the health minister,<strong> </strong>Zweli Mkhize, said on Saturday. South Africa reported 1,727 new cases, taking the cumulative total to 30,967. Its death toll increased by 32 to 643.</p> <h2>Record daily death toll in Pakistan</h2> <p>Pakistan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/30/coronavirus-live-news-trump-us-quitting-who-brazil-russia-iran-australia-uk-outbreak?page=with:block-5ed290808f08f5e37301180d#block-5ed290808f08f5e37301180d\">has reported 78 coronavirus deaths on Saturday</a>, a single day record since the pandemic arrived in the country in March. The country has recorded 135 deaths in the past two days and over 5,000 new cases, with health experts warning of a steep rise in the number of infections in coming days.</p> <h2>Colombia to lift quarantine in parts of the country</h2> <p>Colombia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/30/coronavirus-live-news-trump-us-quitting-who-brazil-russia-iran-australia-uk-outbreak?page=with:block-5ed287238f084df971c8caaa#block-5ed287238f084df971c8caaa\">issued new measures</a> to control the spread of coronavirus in three of its most affected cities on Saturday, including the capital, Bogota, as the rest of the country prepares for quarantine rules to start lifting. It has reported more than 26,600 coronavirus cases and 853 deaths.</p> <h2>Death benefit for New York frontline workers announced</h2> <p>The New York state governor, Andrew Cuomo, signed a bill on Saturday that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/30/coronavirus-live-news-trump-us-quitting-who-brazil-russia-iran-australia-uk-outbreak?page=with:block-5ed29a078f084df971c8cb0d#block-5ed29a078f084df971c8cb0d\">will grant death benefits</a> to the families of police officers, public health workers and other frontline workers who have died of the coronavirus. \u201cYou gave your lives for us, we will be there for your families going forward,\u201d Cuomo said as he signed the legislation.</p>",
  "<p>A top FBI lawyer who was criticised on Fox News for his role in the investigation of Michael Flynn has resigned after being asked to do so by senior figures at the Department of Justice, NBC News reported on Saturday.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/12/what-is-obamagate-and-why-is-trump-so-worked-up-about-it\">What is 'Obamagate' and why is Trump so worked up about it?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The FBI <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/fbi-s-top-lawyer-dana-boente-ousted-amid-fox-news-n1219721?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma\">confirmed to NBC</a> that Dana Boente, its general counsel and a former acting attorney general, announced his resignation on Friday after a near-40-year career. NBC cited two sources anonymous sources as saying the decision came from \u201cAttorney General William Barr\u2019s justice department\u201d.</p> <p>Boente joined the DoJ in 1984 and in 2015 became the US attorney for the eastern district of Virginia, after being nominated by Barack Obama.</p> <p>In January 2017, he briefly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/us/politics/-dana-boente-attorney-general-acting.html\">served as acting attorney general</a>, after Trump fired Sally Yates, an Obama-era deputy, for refusing to defend an executive order on immigration.</p> <p>Temporarily overseeing the investigation of Russian election interference, Boente signed a warrant authorising <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/30/michael-flynn-transcripts-russian-ambassador-senate\">FBI surveillance of Flynn</a>.</p> <p>The retired general, Donald Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, was fired for lying to the vice-president about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/30/michael-flynn-transcripts-russian-ambassador-senate\">contacts with the Russian ambassador</a> during the presidential transition.</p> <p>Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the conversations and cooperated with the special counsel Robert Mueller as he took over the investigation of Russian election interference and links between Trump and Moscow.</p> <p>Flynn sought to withdraw his guilty plea before sentencing. Earlier this month, Barr said the justice department would drop the case, although a federal judge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/19/mike-flynn-case-justice-department-republicans\">put that decision on hold</a>.</p> <p>On Friday, the same day Boente was forced out of the FBI, Trump\u2019s new director of intelligence and Senate Republicans released transcripts of the calls in question, between Flynn and the then Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak.</p> <p>Opponents of the president said the transcripts proved that Flynn had been treated fairly. Supporters of Trump said they showed Flynn had been treated unfairly.</p> <p>As Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/12/what-is-obamagate-and-why-is-trump-so-worked-up-about-it\">attempts to construct a scandal called \u201cObamagate\u201d</a>, with the surveillance of Flynn at its centre, his administration is releasing material it hopes will put Obama officials in a bad light.</p> <p>Boente also wrote a leaked memo concerning material put into the public domain about Flynn, which he said was not exculpatory.</p> <p>Trump is notoriously open to the views of key Fox News contributors.</p> <p>On 27 April, the <a href=\"https://video.foxbusiness.com/v/6152483212001/#sp=show-clips\">Fox News host Lou Dobbs told viewers</a>: \u201cShocking new reports suggest FBI general counsel Dana Boente was acting in coordination with FBI director Christopher Wray to block the release of that evidence that would have cleared General Flynn.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/fbi-christopher-wray-trump-bongino-gorka-36bfbf46-96e2-41cb-93c3-31b362319c3b.html\">reportedly been urged to fire Wray</a>, whom he appointed to replace James Comey, the man <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/08/rosenstein-did-not-want-to-write-memo-justifying-comey-firing-new-book\">he fired in May 2017</a> in an attempt to close the Russia investigation.</p> <p>Comey\u2019s firing led to the appointment of Mueller, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2019/apr/18/mueller-report-trump-russia-key-takeaways\">concluded a near-two-year investigation</a> without proving criminal conspiracy between Trump and Russia.</p> <p>Mueller did, however, obtain convictions of Trump aides and says in his report the campaign was receptive to Russian help. He also laid out extensive evidence of attempts by the president to obstruct his investigation.</p> <p>Trump has fired or forced out FBI and DoJ figures including Andrew McCabe, Comey\u2019s deputy, lawyer Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, an FBI agent who worked on the case.</p> <p>On Friday, Wray issued a statement about Boente.</p> <p>\u201cFew people have served so well in so many critical, high-level roles at the department,\u201d he said. \u201cThroughout his long and distinguished career as a public servant, Dana has demonstrated a selfless determination to ensure that justice is always served on behalf of our citizens.\u201d</p>",

Hurley and Bob Behnken, veterans of space shuttle missions, will join their Nasa colleague Chris Cassidy, already resident with two Russian cosmonauts aboard the ISS.</p> \n<p>As a test mission paving the way for regular flights of Dragon later this year, every aspect of the spacecraft\u2019s performance will be analyzed by SpaceX engineers.

One of two contractors under Nasa\u2019s $6.2bn commercial crew program, SpaceX stole a march on Boeing by completing an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/19/spacex-crew-capsule-escape-test-rocket-explodes-nasa-space-station\">uncrewed abort test</a> in January.

  "<p>The timing was exquisite.

Beijing doesn\u2019t like our anti-dumping measures and is unhappy that Australia has failed to treat its biggest trading partner as a market economy, as agreed in the China Australia Free Trade Agreement.</p> <p>But the decision also came just after Scott Morrison had called for an inquiry into the origins of the Covid-19 outbreak and within the context of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/may/04/mike-pompeo-enomous-evidence-covid-19-came-from-wuhan-lab-video\">Trump administration\u2019s posturing</a> over whether the virus came from a lab in Wuhan, a link the prime minister has not made. Complicating matters is a US-China trade deal early in the year and, though the US is not a big barley supplier, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/17/australia-welcomes-us-china-trade-deal-despite-possible-costs\">farmers were warned</a> it may come at Australia\u2019s expense.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/20/why-has-china-slapped-tariffs-on-australian-barley-and-what-can-australia-do-about-it\">Why has China slapped tariffs on Australian barley and what can Australia do about it?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To most people, barley means beer. But for a lot of Australian growers, it is a handy part of their cropping program, with the end product either sold as malting barley or feed supply, two thirds of which goes to the export market. It is also kept on hand for stock feed if the season takes a turn for the worse. And apart from barley\u2019s value off-farm, it is a useful crop that takes a bit more climatic punishment as global warming proceeds apace.</p> <p>So for the 2020 winter cropping season, good rainfalls in the eastern states presaged one of the better outlooks for Australian farmers in recent years. Western Australian farmers, no strangers to sowing without rainfall, commonly use barley as part of their cropping program and that state, and to a lesser extent South Australia, account for much of the export barley trade.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a389eac89e6024eb464de889a7279bacd049df56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a389eac89e6024eb464de889a7279bacd049df56/26_0_2703_1623/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Silos are loaded with barley in a farm near Gunnedah\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Silos are loaded with barley in a farm near Gunnedah.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Munoz/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>A delicate juggling act</h2> <p>Such is the black humour in the industry that most growers could only shake their heads. China is our biggest barley market by far and Australia is China\u2019s biggest supplier. So when Beijing built a hurdle so high for their internal barley consumers to scale, it cast a pall over regional communities.</p> <p>For most farmers a cropping program is designed to ensure a mix of risk and supply needs, balanced by prices and outlook. It is a delicate juggling act which must take account of the crops or grazing that preceded it, the soil needs, the markets and the global conditions.</p> <p>Those mid-planting who still had time to pivot have done just that.

Beijing also accused Australia of subsiding its farmers, in the form of Murray-Darling water efficiency infrastructure funding, even though barley is a dryland crop.</p> <p>Part of the irony is that Australia has systematically removed longstanding farm subsidies in the past four decades to the point where we have some of the <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-02-14/malcolm-turnbull-correct-on-farmers-subsidies/5252596?nw=0\">lowest \u201cproducer support\u201d levels</a> in the world while international subsidies <a href=\"https://www.agrifutures.com.au/news/new-study-reveals-the-true-cost-of-trade-barriers-and-subsidies-to-australian-agriculture/\">have been calculated to cost local net farming income 15% and 29% of export markets</a>.</p> <p>Brett Hosking, a farmer from Quambatook, Victoria and the chairman of industry advocacy group GrainGrowers, said while the government\u2019s inquiry call was \u201cnot helpful\u201d, it was not the root cause.</p> <p>With the Australian crop harvested in November, the industry is hoping it can be resolved and has urged the government to invest in finding other market opportunities.</p> <p>\u201cPeople say we\u2019ve become too dependent on China but when they were paying a premium for your grain, we would be crazy not to take that,\u201d he says.</p> <p>While there was an immediate price drop of $50-60 a tonne, the price has recovered somewhat. Hosking says one of the major flaws in identifying new markets is that while grain traders know how much each of them has available, there is no visibility on how much barley the country has as a whole \u2013 making it hard to sell and to negotiate with other markets.</p> <h2>\u2018Megaphone diplomacy\u2019</h2> <p>The National Farmers Federation president, Fiona Simson, says both accusations of dumping product and subsidising barley farmers are demonstrably untrue.

Along with barley, <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2020-05-12/china-trade-escalation-as-beef-farmers-are-targeted/12237468\">Beijing also included import bans</a> on four Australian abattoirs, which make up 35% of Australian beef exports to China.</p> <p>Lyons, a Chinese literature scholar, recalls attending a Nanjing wool conference during a fraught period over the wool trade. When the formal sessions were over, the conference unfurled the social events, the highlight of which was a tug of war between teams representing Australia and China.</p> <p>\u201cIt was the perfect metaphor for the relationship in a way, a tug of war over dollars.\u201d</p>",

Now that we have done it for three months, we can see that it works.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What\u2019s a city got that I need anymore?</p> <footer> <cite>Rebecca Andrews</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But more people working from home doesn\u2019t necessarily translate as more people leaving cities.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThere are not that many jobs that are true freelance jobs \u2013 your clients are disproportionately in the big cities,\u201d he says.</p> <p>If many offices move to a hybrid mix of working-from-home and in the office, \u201cthe regions that will do well out of this are within striking distance of major cities \u2013 because companies will want a presence in the office some of the time\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>Cameron Kusher, head of economic research at REA Group \u2013 which includes realestate.com.au \u2013 says that although anecdotally he has heard of people wanting to move to the country, \u201cit\u2019s not showing up much in the data in Victoria and New South Wales\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>Searches for regional properties jumped 11% in Victoria for April compared with March and there was a 16% jump in searches in regional NSW for the corresponding period.&nbsp;But this is down on a year ago, with a 2% fall in Victoria and 1%.</p> <p>Bucking this trend is an overall increase in searches for properties in rural Queensland and Tasmania.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/12/regional-australians-are-just-as-deserving-of-support-as-those-suffering-the-consequences-of-covid-19\">Regional Australians are just as deserving of support as those suffering the consequences of Covid-19 | Pete Mailler</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s too early to tell but it\u2019s logical that people will start to look for houses in regional areas,\u201d Kusher says. \u201cHowever, most businesses will still want people to come into offices a couple of days a week.\u201d</p> <p>That means that towns up to 90 minutes from the CBD with good connections will be more popular than regions such as Warrnambool in Victoria and Orange in NSW, which are both around three hours from capital cities.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIn Sydney, people will push out to outer areas such as the Blue Mountains and Central Coast. In Victoria, Ballarat, Geelong and Mornington Peninsula could be popular.</p> <p>\u201cPeople from Sydney and Melbourne might also start considering Brisbane and Adelaide because they get on a plane pretty quickly to offices in Melbourne and Sydney.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Rebecca Andrews, 40, of Collingwood, will trial regional living with her boyfriend when overnight stay restrictions lift in Victoria. They have short stays lined up in the Dandenongs, Yarra Valley and Castlemaine \u2013 all places within 90 minutes of the Melbourne CBD. If it works, they\u2019ll move out of the city.&nbsp;</p> <p>Andrews runs a popular events newsletter called The Sprinkler and works as a freelance journalist. She is usually out at several events around Melbourne five or more times a week but the pandemic brought on a major life shift for her. </p> <p>\u201cCovid has definitely influenced my decision to live in the country,\u201d she says. \u201cHaving spent three months in isolation, I\u2019ve been winding down and not feeling the pressure of having to go to social functions and catch up with mates. Since I\u2019ve been at home all the time and slowing down, I\u2019ve found there\u2019s not much need to get energy from huge social things.\u201d</p> <p>Now she wants to spend more time in nature. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge difference between being in a city park and out in the wilderness. You can\u2019t even compare. What\u2019s a city got that I need anymore? I mean I\u2019m 40, I\u2019m not in my 20s \u2013 and although I\u2019m still an extrovert, I\u2019m getting really nice benefits from iso.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CAwFW8chn9T/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

People stumbled away gasping for breath, futilely rubbing their eyes.</p> \n<p>For a few minutes, it looked as if Minnesota\u2019s governor, Tim Walz, had delivered on his pledge to take back control of the streets of Minneapolis. He had said there would be no repeat on Friday of the previous night\u2019s destruction, after thousands of people stormed and burned the third precinct police station at the centre of the outrage over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/derek-chauvin-police-officer-charged-george-floyd\">the killing of George Floyd</a>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/george-floyd-killing-protests-us-police\">But then the crowd regrouped</a> and the test of strength began to go its way. The police couldn\u2019t fire teargas fast enough, and retreated block by block. Soon the demonstrators were back in control of the looted police station. It was a symbolic victory that only encouraged them.</p> \n<p>Waltz had threatened to send in the national guard but it was nowhere to be seen and the police suddenly seemed to evaporate.</p> \n<p>By the time the sun went down, the protesters were in control of a two-mile stretch of a busy shopping street, and much of the area around it, in the south of the city. The curfew had collapsed.</p> \n<p>Plunder and arson escalated. So did partying and drag racing after a large crowd helped themselves to the contents of a sprawling liquor store. One group set fire to a Shell petrol station. Businesses were looted wholesale except where the owners were on guard in the mostly Latino neighbourhood.</p> \n<p>By the time the sun rose on Saturday, a visibly furious Walz called a full mobilisation of the national guard for the first time since the second world war. He denounced the destruction as making a mockery of claims the protests were about Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd. It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great city,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Walz said there were \u201celements present\u201d in the rioting of domestic terrorism, ideological extremism and international destabilisation. He denounced \u201canarchists who are burning down damn buildings that were built up by indigenous owners\u201d and said it was overshadowing the death of Floyd.</p> \n<p>But it was also true that large numbers of people on the streets on Friday night were from Minneapolis.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"877b9c6d-7c9c-4a97-827a-1b9af0c16314\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iwPPqDryPO8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The city authorities had hoped the homicide charges against the police officer seen kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck for nearly nine minutes, Derek Chauvin, would go some way to defuse anger on the streets. But there were immediate demands for the arrest of three other officers involved, and questions about why Chauvin was facing only third-degree murder and manslaughter charges when the common view was that he is guilty of a much more serious crime.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/george-floyd-killing-protests-us-police\">Protests flared across the US</a>, from New York to Denver and Los Angeles. Seven people were shot during demonstrations in Louisville, Kentucky. Another person was killed in Detroit.</p> \n<p>Outside the White House in Washington, protesters hurled bits of brick and bottles at US Secret Service agents and police officers in riot gear. Some attempted to break through barriers and wrestled with the police.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/30/trump-secret-service-george-floyd-protesters-white-house\">On Saturday morning</a>, Donald Trump tweeted: \u201cBig crowd, professionally organized, but nobody came close to breaching the fence.

  "<p><strong>The Archers</strong> (BBC Radio 4) | <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000jfzc\">BBC Sounds</a></p> <p>Back in late March, lockdown caught many of us on the hop. The changes to work and life were swift and devastating. Some professions could adapt fairly easily, others couldn\u2019t. Drama is an industry that\u2019s suffered greatly; many great theatres have already had to close down for ever. But audio drama has a few advantages. It\u2019s not TV, it\u2019s not a full theatre production. No need for costumes or cameras, to learn lines or adjust lighting. The audience is still there, stuck at home\u2026</p> <p>Which brings me to <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000jfzc\">The Archers</a></strong>. A well-oiled, beautifully run, wonderfully staffed ship that\u2019s not built for turning, let alone pivoting to WFH, <em>The Archers</em> has found the lockdown difficult. Usually, the writing is done weeks in advance, with the storylines worked out even earlier. Each episode is recorded in the studio as live, the cast acting the whole thing without stopping. Sound effects are played in at the same time, with some added later.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>David seemed as worked up about Ruth's lasagne as he did about not getting on with his son</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Because of these pre-recorded episodes, for a long while after lockdown life in Ambridge continued with no reference to coronavirus at all. Lynda Snell and workman Blake were in hospital, post-hotel explosion, with various family, friends and foes popping in and out at will. Social distancing was most definitely not observed. PPE was never mentioned, nary a hint of a hand-sanitiser shortage. But then, in early May, the pre-records ran out, and for the past three weeks, <em>The Archers</em> has been reduced to replaying old episodes. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000j7b2\">The Flower and Produce Show</a>\u201d was one; \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05410wn\">Floods Hit Ambridge</a>\u201d another. During this time, entire storylines were mothballed (bye bye, Kirsty\u2019s marriage to dodgy Philip), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/19/the-archers-episodes-lockdown-ambridge-radio-4-rural-soap-coronavirus\">12</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/19/the-archers-episodes-lockdown-ambridge-radio-4-rural-soap-coronavirus\"> scripts were binned</a>, and the decision was made for actors to record monologues at home.</p> <p>Though I understand the reasoning, I\u2019m not convinced this was the right decision. The new-style episodes began last week, and they were pretty poor fare. The first, which consisted of David\u2019s moaning about his son Josh, intercut with Josh moaning about David, was a shocker. Beautifully recorded (well done, Tim Bentinck and Angus Imrie), the super-clean voices meant that the added farm atmosphere (David got cows, Josh, geese) sounded ridiculous. Far worse, though, was the spectacularly boring writing. No mention of the frustrations of coronavirus, the alterations to farm work, being cooped up with family, new worries or irritations. Just some waffle about silage and lasagne, with some rousing \u201cwe\u2019ll all get through this together\u201d at the end. (David seemed exactly as worked up about Ruth\u2019s lasagne as he did about not getting on with his son. Maybe it\u2019s an <em>Archers</em> stoicism thing.)</p> <p>The second episode had a couple of nods towards how people actually live, with Tracy making a \u201cvlog\u201d, according to son Brad (who uses that word, in 2020?) about what she thinks the cricket team should be doing during lockdown, and Harrison, policeman and actual cricket captain, responding. Both Harrison and Tracy were heard making phone calls. Unfortunately these were as realistic as a toddler holding up a banana to her ear and saying \u201cHewoh\u201d. When people make phone calls, you can hear the other person on the line! There was nothing in the audio to distinguish between them talking to themselves, talking to a selfie camera, or talking to another person on the phone. No background noise of other people in the house. No one Zooming their family. Everything happening somewhere else.</p> <p>I\u2019m sure the shows will improve as all involved get used to the new way, but these episodes were lame, and revealed the lack of flexibility in how <em>The Archers</em> gets made. No real outdoor atmosphere, no actual phone calls, no moving out of a studio. TV has made a couple of successful forays into drama that acknowledge lockdown\u2019s restrictions and make use of them. Why can\u2019t the actors\u2019 parts be recorded&nbsp;as live, simultaneously (like podcasts have been doing during lockdown), so they interact&nbsp;in real&nbsp;time? The tech is there. These episodes were snoresome and silly. <em>The Archers</em> has made a non-drama out of a crisis.</p> <h2>Three mind-expanding shows&nbsp;</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.talkingpoliticspodcast.com/history-of-ideas\">Talking Politics: The History of Ideas&nbsp;</a><br></strong>A few people have raved to me about this podcast series, which only started on 27 April&nbsp;and has already put out 12 episodes (at the time of writing). In association with the <em>London Review of Books</em>, this set of talks by David Runciman has him exploring the important thinkers behind modern politics, starting with Hobbes and moving through Wollstonecraft, Marx and Engels to Fukuyama and beyond. The shows are interesting but academic: essentially, 45-minute university-style lectures. Runciman is likable and knows his stuff, but if you want bells and whistles, search elsewhere.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e9771bb08af49da45265fc18c09b5884cf2766f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e9771bb08af49da45265fc18c09b5884cf2766f/0_303_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cambridge academic David Runciman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018He knows his stuff\u2019: David Runciman, presenter of Talking Politics.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://art19.com/shows/clever-creature\">Clever Creature</a></strong>&nbsp;<br>An experiment from <em><a href=\"https://bigthink.com/podcast/\">Think Again</a></em> producer and host Jason Gots. Each episode starts with a random word, and Jason gives himself one day to write a short story and a song inspired by it. (At the start, he explains that he\u2019s trying to kick his procrastination habit.) As you might expect, the results are hit and miss. The songs are better than the short stories, but the stories kick off interesting chats with, in the first episode, Jason\u2019s son Emre about a desert made of ice-cream, and, in the second, novelist Gish Jen. Plus there\u2019s a meditation at the end of each episode. Ambitious and touching.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/waldy-and-bendys-adventures-in-art/id1510587218\">Waldy and Bendy\u2019s Adventures in Art</a><br></strong>Waldemar Januszczak, the <em>Sunday Times</em> art critic, is joined by art historian and TV art expert Bendor Grosvenor in this jolly art podcast. Januszczak and Grosvenor are broadcast naturals (especially showoff Januszczak), and the conversation is lively and interesting, running off into all sort of unexpected areas. I\u2019d like it if Januszczak\u2019s home-recorded voice was a little brighter-sounding but that\u2019s a quibble; these two know their stuff and they engage you with their chat.

  "<p>\u201cThe British sporting recovery has begun,\u201d declared the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, as he announced that professional sport in England can resume from Monday, paving the way for the first domestic live action in almost three months.</p> \n<p>Speaking at the daily Downing Street press briefing, Dowden said the government had settled on a set of strict conditions that must be followed for sports to be allowed to return behind closed doors. The rules form stage three of the process of bringing sport back from the coronavirus lockdown. Stage two, which allowed for close-contact training for elite athletes, was published last Monday.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe wait is over. Live British sport will shortly be back on in safe and carefully controlled environments,\u201d he said. \u201cThis guidance provides the safe framework for sports to resume competitions.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/30/premiership-final-could-clash-six-nations-as-restart-further-delay\">Premiership final could clash with Six Nations as restart faces further delay</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cIt is now up to individual sports to confirm they can meet these protocols and decide when it\u2019s right for them to restart. This is a significant moment for British sport. By working with clinicians every step of the way, we are creating the safest possible environments for everyone involved.\u201d</p> \n<p>That means the Premier League can go ahead with its planned restart on 17 June \u2013 \u201cI can now make it official: football is coming back,\u201d said Dowden.</p> \n<p>There was further encouragement for the Premier League with the news that from 1,130 Covid-19 tests conducted on players and staff on Thursday and Friday, none had returned a positive. However, the EFL followed up with results of its own, reporting 10 positive tests from eight clubs in the Championship and seven positives from three clubs in League Two. There is no programme of testing for League One at present.</p> \n<p>A packed schedule of horse racing begins at Newcastle on Monday and builds quickly to Newmarket\u2019s 2,000 Guineas classic on Saturday.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s up to each individual sport to decide exactly when to resume competition; they know their sports best,\u201d Dowden continued. \u201cBut football, tennis, horse racing, Formula One, cricket, golf, rugby, snooker and others are set to return to our screens shortly, with horse racing first out of the gate in the north-east next week.\u201d</p> \n<p>The guidelines, which he said had been developed at dozens of meetings with chief medical officers from a range of sporting bodies, require venues to put in place a screening process to detect coronavirus symptoms on entry, a one-way system for people and vehicles, minimal use of dressing rooms and for social distancing to be maintained where possible.</p> \n<p>A third of the Premier League\u2019s remaining 92 games will be broadcast free to air, which Dowden said followed his own intervention. \u201cThis is an open invitation for all fans to be part of this significant moment in our sporting history,\u201d he said, adding that it would also encourage fans to stay at home to watch.</p> \n<p>He included encouraging words for women\u2019s sport, saying he would try to identify ways to recover the momentum lost along with some major events. \u201cVisibility matters and our daughters deserve to see female athletes on the main stage.\u201d</p> \n<p>Richard Masters, chief executive of the Premier League, welcomed the news but described the 17 June restart as provisional. \u201cThere is still much work to be done to ensure the safety of everyone involved,\u201d he said. \u201cThis includes consulting with our clubs, players and managers - along with all our other stakeholders - as the health and welfare of our participants and supporters is our priority.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dowden\u2019s news does not apply to Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland and there was a warning that Scottish football might struggle to meet the 1 August date set for its own return. Jason Leitch, the Scottish government\u2019s national clinical director, said it depended on \u201ca fair wind and the virus behaving itself, and of course the population behaving itself\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/30/premier-league-clubs-told-depleted-squads-will-not-delay-restart\">Premier League clubs told depleted squads will not delay restart</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Frankie Dettori was among the first to welcome the government\u2019s announcement. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic news,\u201d said the veteran jockey, who believes his sport is now well placed to hog the limelight for a short time. \u201cWe\u2019ve got two weeks\u2019 start on football, the whole country\u2019s starved of sport and racing in this country is of the highest quality. People will be able to enjoy our sport on the box and I have no doubt we can put on a good show for everyone.\u201d</p> \n<p>Monday\u2019s resumption of racing at Newcastle was so over-subscribed that 198 entrants had to be turned away. Dettori will make his own return to action at Kempton the next day but is already looking forward to Friday at Newmarket, when he will ride Stradivarius in the Coronation Cup, taking on last year\u2019s Derby winner, Anthony Van Dyck. It is one of 21 races due to be screened by ITV next weekend.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like, wow,\u201d said Dettori, relishing the imminence of such quality racing. \u201cGreat horses are ready to go. If everything goes smooth, we\u2019ll be able to catch up on the Classics and by the end of July the programme of horse racing will be back to normal.\u201d</p> \n<p>The lobbying methods and public pronouncements of racing\u2019s ruling body, the British Horseracing Authority, have been criticised, but Dettori was happy to give them credit. \u201cWe put a great proposal to the government. The BHA and the horsemen have worked tirelessly. We\u2019re going to be taking precautions on top of precautions.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been riding out with a mask on, to get used to it. I\u2019ve been talking to my French colleagues, they told me it\u2019s a little bit of a hindrance, it\u2019s stopping your air-flow, but I\u2019m getting my body used to it and I have no problem at all.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked if the news was a relief, Dettori said: \u201cI think more for my wife and kids, they\u2019ll be happy to see the back of me, to be honest. We are arguing about stupid things at the moment, who did not empty the dishwasher, who took the last ice cream. I\u2019m getting the sign that it\u2019s about time for me to leave the house and go to work.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>This slippery tease of a movie opens with a shot of a man weaving through the traffic on a bike in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, with a goat slung around his shoulders like a stole. Then we\u2019re whirled from west Africa to snowy central France, and a rural wilderness where a woman has disappeared, her car abandoned by the side of an ice-crusted road. Unpeeling the story of how a mystery in France is connected to a teeming city in Africa, director Dominik Moll and his co-writer Gilles Marchand employ <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jun/17/rashomon-kurosawa-film-review\">Rashomon</a></em>-style multiple perspectives. The story is repeatedly rewound, explored from the viewpoint of an unfaithful wife, her oddball farmer lover, her glowering husband, the missing woman\u2019s lover and an enterprising young man in Abidjan.</p> <p>This is film-making that really tests the elasticity of its story strands, but it largely manages to keep the audience from teetering into disbelief. For the most part, that\u2019s thanks to persuasively solid characters and casting. Denis M\u00e9nochet, French cinema\u2019s go-to guy for stewing, inarticulate surliness, is characteristically excellent, an anchor of credibility who grounds the picture. But the discovery here is newcomer Guy Roger \u201cBibisse\u201d N\u2019Drin, playing the impoverished young African whose quest for wealth is the final piece of a satisfying jigsaw plot.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HYJ6CjOzi8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5HYJ6CjOzi8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HYJ6CjOzi8&amp;feature=emb_title\">Watch a trailer for Only the Animals</a></figcaption> </figure>   <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.curzonhomecinema.com/film/watch-only-the-animals-film-online\">Only the Animals is on Curzon Home Cinema</a></p></li> </ul>",
  "<p><strong>Time is very weird </strong>at the moment. It\u2019s elastic, but in terms of creativity I am always as much about the here and now as about looking at art and things from the past. I love both.</p> <p><strong>As a child in the suburbs,</strong> I tried to avoid anything that was team-related. I had a very brief career, from the age of eight, on a football team, and I tried ice hockey. My father dreamed I might be the first half-Turkish hockey pro. It came to nothing. I spent most of my time drawing and daydreaming.</p> <p><strong>My mum\u2019s family</strong> lived in the Midlands, my dad\u2019s in Eastern Turkey. They had different accents and I had a different name to everyone else. That was uncomfortable. Now I see that acute contrast of heritage is not only a wonderful thing, it\u2019s who I am.</p> <p><strong>The Royal College of Art </strong>in 2001 was just the most extraordinary place to be. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/wolfgang-tillmans\" title=\"\">Wolfgang Tillmans</a> lectured on photography, there were talks by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/sep/15/hussein-chalayan-everything-we-build-and-design-in-a-way-reflects-the-body\" title=\"\">Hussein Chalayan</a> in the architecture department. It was all about cross-pollination.</p> <p><strong>I felt my parents\u2019 </strong>homesickness through my father\u2019s Turkish dishes and my mum\u2019s Sunday roasts. I wanted what I was never allowed: a Coke and a hot dog.</p> <p><strong>No one in the world </strong>knows me better than my twin sister. As children, we played together any which way. Not \u201cthat\u2019s for girls and that\u2019s for boys\u201d. I never equated the feminine as inappropriate, which is so often pinned on kids when they are playing.</p> <p><strong>A whole collection </strong>can come out of someone else\u2019s story. You imagine their lives, who they were, forensically putting them together. Whether it\u2019s [Victorian biologist] Marianne North or [Victorian cross-dressers] \u201cFanny\u201d and \u201cStella\u201d, I am always looking for the magic of narrative to propel me forward.</p> <p><strong>My belief in beauty</strong>, the idea that it can transport you, has a tremendous power. My work has always had to do with a love of the feminine and nature.</p> <p><strong>When I first </strong>realised I was gay, as a child, I was so totally closed. If you told me I would be happily married one day I would never have believed it. But that feeling of being closed also allowed my imagination to run.</p> <p><strong>I am absolutely</strong> optimistic that out of the current situation good and positive change will come. This idea that one can jump on and off a plane and not think about it will come into question.</p> <p><strong>When we opened </strong>our Mayfair store 5 years ago, which my husband Philip designed, we created a universe for an imaginary woman. We asked: what carpet she would want to feel under her feet, what furniture would she like? We underestimate the power of physical spaces.</p> <p><strong>My studio is </strong>my portable paradise. It\u2019s where I feel complete, whether I am alone or with my team. I really miss my team.</p> <p><strong>There is something</strong> about the hunt that I find really exciting. I see something I want, I pursue it. That makes me go weak at the knees. <br><strong><br>I have always</strong> been attracted to things that feel alive. Even as a child a colour was something I felt. <br><br><strong>Cecil Beaton was constantly</strong> reaching, taking the next step up. He wasn\u2019t born into the role that he played: he created that role. Tina Modotti also took sidesteps. She was a communist agent and a film star \u2013 she became who she wanted to be. The idea of transformation fascinates me.</p> <p><strong>I don\u2019t cry,</strong> or if I do, it is altitude-related: on a plane watching a sad film. Do I have a heart of stone?</p> <p><strong>We have just purchased</strong> a robotic hoover. It amuses me no end. It does its own thing, takes control of the situation. I recommend it. <br><br><strong>If I could change </strong>one thing about the UK, it would be for it to be more altruistic. Our fear of the other is the most important thing to eliminate. For myself, I\u2019d change my impatience. My mum was so superstitious. She was always knocking on wood. She definitely passed that on to me. I avoid breaking mirrors and walking under ladders. Both my sister and I are functioning superstitious people.<br><br><strong>I am most happy</strong> when I am with my other half.</p> <p><em>Erdem is donating 10% of sales from its <a href=\"https://erdem.com/en-gb/shop/shop-by-collection/spring-summer-2020.html\" title=\"\">spring summer collection</a> to the <a href=\"https://nationalemergenciestrust.org.uk/coronavirus/\" title=\"\">National Emergencies Trust Corona Virus Appeal</a></em></p>",

In 2019, a Facebook spokesperson declined to clarify the company\u2019s policy around violence and hate speech by state actors on the record to the Guardian. The Guardian has contacted Facebook for comment. </p> \n  <p>This is not the first time that Facebook\u2019s exemption of state actors from content rules has been questioned. During the campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya in Myanmar, Facebook banned an insurgent group fighting to defend the Muslim minority while allowing Myanmar\u2019s military, the Tatmadaw, to continue using its platform to spread its propaganda. </p> \n  <p>Facebook subsequently banned a number of ethnic armed organizations in Myanmar, designating the officially recognized groups as the equivalent to terrorist organizations. The move prompted an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/07/facebook-myanmar-genocide-violence-hate-speech\">outcry from human rights experts</a> who said the company\u2019s decision to favor state actors over non-state actors in armed conflict was inconsistent with both international law and human rights. </p> \n  <p>In his lengthy post, Zuckerberg also appeared to suggest that if Facebook had decided Trump\u2019s post was intended to incite violence by civilians, they would have taken it down, writing, \u201cUnlike Twitter, we do not have a policy of putting a warning in front of posts that may incite violence because we believe that if a post incites violence, it should be removed regardless of whether it is newsworthy, even if it comes from a politician.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Zuckerberg also criticized Trump, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve been struggling with how to respond to the President\u2019s tweets and posts all day. Personally, I have a visceral negative reaction to this kind of divisive and inflammatory rhetoric.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He added: \u201cI disagree strongly with how the President spoke about this, but I believe people should be able to see this for themselves, because ultimately accountability for those in positions of power can only happen when their speech is scrutinized out in the open.\u201d </p>

reports on the criminal complaint against Derek Chauvin, which provides new details on the killing of George Floyd. </strong></p> \n  <p>Derek Chauvin, the ex-Minneapolis police officer charged today with third-degree murder and manslaughter in connection with the killing of George Floyd, had his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds total, according to the <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/read-the-complaint-charging-derek-chauvin-in-the-death-of-george-floyd/570870791/\">complaint</a>.</p> \n  <p>For two minutes and 53 seconds, Floyd was \u201cnon-responsive\u201d.</p> \n  <p>\u201cPolice are trained that this type of restraint with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous,\u201d the complaint states. </p> \n  <p>As captured in the now-viral video, Floyd repeatedly told the officers \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d before pleading with them, saying \u201cMama\u201d and \u201cplease\u201d. One of the officers responded, \u201cYou are talking fine\u201d as he struggled. </p> \n  <p>The other three officers, identified by authorities as Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng, were also fired. According to the complaint, Lane had asked, \u201cShould we roll him on his side?\u201d </p> \n  <p>Chauvin responded, \u201cNo, staying put where we got him.\u201d </p> \n  <p>\u201cI am worried about excited delirium or whatever,\u201d Lane said. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we have him on his stomach,\u201d Chauvin said. </p> \n  <p>The medical examiner\u2019s autopsy report is still pending, but preliminary findings have determined that a combination of the police hold on Floyd, his underlying health conditions of coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease, as well as \u201cany potential intoxicants\u201d likely contributed to his death. </p> \n  <p>Floyd ended up on the ground after Lane pointed his gun at him and instructed him to step out of a car. Lane and Kueng had been responding to a report that someone had used a counterfeit $20 bill at a nearby store, and the store owner identified the person as sitting in a parked car around the corner. There were three people in the car. </p> \n  <p>The officers had handcuffed Floyd and were walking him to their police cruiser when he \u201cstiffened up, fell to the ground, and told the officers he was claustrophobic.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Chauvin and Thoa arrived at about 8:14pm. Within five minutes, Chauvin had his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck.</p> \n  <p>At 8:25pm, the video \u201cappears to show Mr Floyd ceasing to breathe or speak\u201d.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWant to roll him on his side?\u201d Lane asked. Kueng then checked Floyds wrist for a pulse. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find one.\u201d </p> \n  <p>\u201cNone of the officers moved from their positions,\u201d the complaint states. </p> \n  <p>At 8:27pm, Chauvin removed his knee. <br><br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed192938f087122eca52364\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T23:05:02.715Z\">12.05am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>While the imagery of fires and broken windows have dominated the news, reporters in the Twin Cities have also been documenting acts of community, solidarity and mutual aid. </strong></p> \n  <p>Chris McGreal is in Minneapolis reporting for the Guardian, where he has spoken with community members volunteering to clean up the neighborhood or keep watch over their neighbors. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisMcGreal/status/1266428976723111938\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Ayanle Hashi who spent Thursday night guarding his Minneapolis apartment building as crowds looted shops below and neighbouring stores. \u201cThere are disabled and old people in this building.

  "<p>To understand how wide Beijing now casts its security net in Hong Kong, consider the case of Martin Lee. Now in his 80s, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/24/i-wont-allow-this-to-be-the-end-of-hong-kong-campaigner-on-his-long-fight-for-democracy\">Lee is a distinguished barrister</a>, a politician and a lifelong defender of civil liberties.&nbsp;He has never committed an act of violence or advocated that others do so.</p> <p>Last month, in an early sign of what was coming, Lee was arrested at his home.&nbsp;Fourteen other prominent Hong Kong citizens were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/police-in-hong-kong-arrest-14-activists-amid-autonomy-warnings\">taken into custody that day</a> and charged with taking part in illegal demonstrations. He has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/21/i-was-arrested-hong-kong-its-part-chinas-larger-plan/\">pointed out</a> that he was already facing 14 similar charges in mainland China, and had the extradition law that triggered last year\u2019s protests in Hong Kong been adopted he could have been sent for trial in China under a system that not even the Chinese Communist party\u2019s (CCP) most generous supporters could describe as adequate. The CCP regards rule of law and separation of powers as threats to its power. Law, for the party, is one instrument among many&nbsp;that can be used to eliminate opponents \u2013 who can be anyone from dissenting public intellectuals to prominent businessmen.&nbsp;</p> <p>Lee was a member of the drafting committee for the Basic Law, Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution and the legal scaffolding of the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/29/hong-kong-the-end-of-one-country-two-systems\">one </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/29/hong-kong-the-end-of-one-country-two-systems\">country, </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/29/hong-kong-the-end-of-one-country-two-systems\">two </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/29/hong-kong-the-end-of-one-country-two-systems\">systems</a>\u201d formula promoted by the late paramount leader of China, Deng Xiaoping.&nbsp;Deng saw it as the means by which China could recover sovereignty over the British colony while preserving Hong Kong\u2019s&nbsp;civil liberties, rule of law, a relative lack of corruption and even an accountable government. He understood that these features had made Hong Kong a thriving centre of global finance and it was key to the economic renaissance of China that became his great legacy.&nbsp;</p> <p>Not only has&nbsp;Hong Kong been essential to huge volumes of investment into China, it has also been a place where information and ideas that are stifled on the mainland could flourish, a place where spies from all over the world could learn each other\u2019s secrets, civil society groups could organise and religious practice could thrive. Its media freedoms helped to save the world from the worst effects of the <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/24/asia/china-sars-coronavirus-intl-hnk/index.html\">S</a><a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/24/asia/china-sars-coronavirus-intl-hnk/index.html\">ars epidemic in 2003</a>: it was in Hong Kong that the CCP\u2019s months-long silence was broken.&nbsp;Without that, many more people would certainly have died.&nbsp;</p> <p>Hong Kong has also been a safety valve for a Chinese political system that has lurched too often between intense repression and violent convulsion. One reason the people of Hong Kong <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/10/what-are-the-hong-kong-protests-about-explainer\">defend their freedoms so vigorously</a> is that so many of them are there because they, or their parents or grandparents risked their lives to escape from China.&nbsp;They learned the value of Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms from personal experience.</p> <p>Deng, too,&nbsp;had experience of both the oppression and the convulsion and&nbsp;understood the value to China of Hong Kong as a place apart.&nbsp;He sent tanks to crush the students in Tiananmen Square in 1989, but he didn\u2019t prevent the people of Hong Kong gathering, as they have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/04/tiananmen-square-massacre-marked-with-hong-kong-vigil\">every 4 June</a> since,&nbsp;to remember the dead.&nbsp;This is the first year that that gathering is in doubt.&nbsp;</p> <p>Speaking in New York in 2014, Lee pointed out that Deng\u2019s promises to Hong Kong included no interference in its affairs by any mainland institution and the introduction of universal suffrage. Without universal suffrage, Lee warned, Hong Kong people would mistrust their government and the region would not be stable.&nbsp;But Beijing had repeatedly postponed universal suffrage, and in June 2014 China\u2019s state council published a white paper that claimed government in <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2014/06/11/world/asia/hong-kong-beijing-two-systems-paper/index.html\">Beijing had comprehensive jurisdiction</a> over Hong Kong and Macau. As Lee predicted, Hong Kong has not been stable, Beijing has steadily lost support, and today a majority of people in the region identify as citizens of Hong Kong, but not of China.&nbsp;</p> <p>Every move to tighten control since 1997 has been met with resistance. Throughout last year\u2019s growing tumult provoked by a proposed extradition law, Carrie Lam, the latest in a line of disastrous chief executives, argued that Hong Kong\u2019s silent majority supported her government. In an exceptionally large turnout, that majority responded by giving <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/24/hong-kong-residents-turn-up-for-local-elections-in-record-numbers\">90% support to democratic parties</a> in the local elections in November.&nbsp;Beijing is anxious to avoid another electoral humiliation in the legislative elections later this year.&nbsp;</p> <p>As resistance mounted, Beijing drew the lesson that only further repression would suffice, fatally undermining Deng\u2019s vision of a self-governing and stable Hong Kong. It has&nbsp;now effectively torn up the treaty it signed with Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government and condemned Hong Kong to further unrest and decline.&nbsp;If Beijing\u2019s desired outcome was stability and security, it has disastrously mishandled it. Few doubt that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/china-vote-npc-national-security-laws-hong-kong-us-protest\">Beijing\u2019s security law</a> will criminalise dissent, undermine the rule of law and target prominent activists such as the youth leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/joshua-wong\">Joshua Wong</a>, as well as veterans such as Lee. Further turmoil is inevitable.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/22/china-foisting-anti-sedition-law-hong-kong-freedoms\">China is foisting an anti-sedition law that will change Hong Kong for ever | Ilaria Maria Sala and Louisa Lim</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The UK has been shamefully feeble in defence of Hong Kong, though the recent hardening of attitudes towards China within the Conservative party may produce something more than the usual pro-forma expression of concern.&nbsp;Hong Kong\u2019s best hopes of support, however, lie in Washington. Under the 1992 Hong Kong Policy Act, the territory enjoys special trade status with the US, provided the secretary of state certifies annually to Congress that it retains its autonomous status. When, on Wednesday, Mike Pompeo notified Congress that Hong Kong could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/hong-kong-china-autonomous-us-pompeo-security-law\">no longer be considered autonomous</a>, the question left open is what will the Trump administration, already locked in angry confrontation with China, do about it?</p> <p>The nuclear option of revoking Hong Kong\u2019s US trade privileges would hurt Hong Kong more than China and could provoke direct retaliation on hundreds of US businesses in both regions.&nbsp;Other options, which include targeted sanctions on party officials, asset freezes and visa restrictions, carry similar risks. In other times, the US might have mobilised its allies to support a concerted rebuke in the upcoming G7 meeting and other high-level gatherings. But Trump is noted neither for effective nor skilful alliances, and his administration has been described as having an attitude to China but not a policy. As for the UK, the least it should do is to open its doors to those citizens of Hong Kong who hold British national (overseas) passports, something it should have done in 1997. This week, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, spoke of opening up a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/uk-will-extend-visas-for-300000-hong-kong-residents-says-raab\">pathway to future citizenship</a>\u201d for BN(O)s, if China doesn\u2019t \u201cstep back\u201d from implementing the security bill. But, so far, these are just words. If the UK is to have any pretence to international standing, it must honour its moral debt.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022&nbsp;Isabel Hilton is a London-based&nbsp;writer&nbsp;and broadcaster who has reported extensively from China and Hong Kong</p>",

About 8.4 million workers have been furloughed, tens of thousands have lost their jobs and many self-employed workers\u2019 incomes have taken a hit.</p> \n<p>Even the lives of those who are still in work may have changed dramatically. Working from home has become the norm for many, and employees at some firms have already been told this will carry on until at least the autumn. Meanwhile, physical distancing measures are likely to remain for many more months and a whole swathe of events, from holidays to festivals to weddings, have been cancelled. And behind all of this is a virus that can be deadly.</p> \n<p>With all of this in mind, it\u2019s possible your financial set-up no longer matches your lifestyle and needs. Guardian Money has put together a guide to getting everything in order as we all adapt to new ways of going about our daily lives.</p> \n<h2><strong>Reducing household costs</strong></h2> \n<ul> \n <li>Wholesale <strong>energy prices</strong> have dropped as a result of factories and businesses being closed and demand for fuel falling across the world. The very cheapest dual gas and electricity tariffs cost \u00a3750 a year for a medium-sized house with average consumption. Households on their supplier\u2019s capped standard tariff will typically save more than \u00a3300 a year by switching. Tonik Energy\u2019s green super power v4 tariff is arguably the pick of the cheapest deals and it\u2019s fixed for a year. Prices have fallen so much that those on fixed deals bought before March should consider moving supplier too and pay any exit fees. Use <a href=\"http://energyhelpline.com/\">Energyhelpline.com</a> to find out what your household can save. </li> \n <li>Housing is likely to be your biggest outlay. If you have a <strong>mortgage</strong> and have taken a three-month payment holiday, you may be aware that on 22 May the government said people can extend this for a further three months (the first ones were due to come to an end in June). Meanwhile, those who are struggling but have not yet taken a mortgage payment holiday will have until 31 October to apply. However, there are also other options available to borrowers, either now or at the end of the holiday. Two of the main ones are temporarily switching to interest-only payments and increasing the length of the mortgage term. Both will reduce your monthly payments but there\u2019s a price to pay. For example, increasing the mortgage term will ultimately mean paying a lot more interest. </li> \n <li>Most local authorities are offering <strong>council tax</strong> payment holidays to those struggling but you have to ask for one, and there is no guarantee the answer will be yes. Those on universal credit or low incomes may be able to get their bill reduced, or in some cases waived. The amount of reduction depends on your circumstances and the council. On top of the discount, in England, you may also get an extra \u00a3150 off your bill, backed by a \u00a3500m Covid-19 hardship fund. </li> \n</ul> \n<h2><strong>Making up for lost income</strong></h2> \n<ul> \n <li>You may be entitled to <strong>benefits</strong> to top up your earnings. Anna Stevenson from the advice charity Turn2Us says it is \u201cvery difficult to talk in specific sums because each household\u2019s claim is different, depending on the rent they pay and a host of other factors, including the number of children etc\u201d. The charity has <a href=\"https://benefits-calculator.turn2us.org.uk/AboutYou\">a benefits calculator</a> on its website, which will help you work out what you can claim.Households who receive working tax credits and whose annual income is expected to be more than \u00a32,500 different to the previous tax year should contact HM Revenue &amp; Customs and declare a change of circumstances, which should bring a change in payments. Stevenson says some people on working tax credits, which are typically no longer available to new claimants, may be better off switching to universal credit but they should use a calculator to check before they make a claim. </li> \n <li>Are you a higher earner with children who has suffered a drop in income due to the pandemic? If your income is set to be less than \u00a360,000, then get your <strong>child benefit</strong> restarted. It\u2019s worth \u00a31,820 a year for a family with two children. Under the high-income child benefit charge (HICBC), if you or your partner earn more than \u00a350,000 a year, the benefit is progressively clawed back through the tax system until it is worth nothing on incomes over \u00a360,000. Thousands of parents who opted out of receiving child benefit, or never started claiming in the first place, because they had to pay the HICBC will be eligible to claim or restart the payments. To restart child benefit, either fill in an online form or call <a href=\"tel:0300%20200%203100\">0300 200 3100</a>. For more information go to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-tax-charge/restart-child-benefit\">gov.uk/child-benefit-tax-charge/restart-child-benefit</a>. </li> \n <li>If your salary has dropped below \u00a350,000 as a result of the crisis, there could be \u00a3250 with your name on it, courtesy of the <strong>marriage allowance</strong>. This tax break lets one partner transfer \u00a31,250 of his or her personal allowance to their other half, thereby reducing that person\u2019s tax by up to \u00a3250 in the current tax year. You can claim it provided all of the following apply: you are married or in a civil partnership; one partner\u2019s income is below \u00a312,500, or nothing; and the other partner\u2019s income is between \u00a312,501 and \u00a350,000, or \u00a343,430 in Scotland. HMRC will typically give the recipient partner their extra allowance either by changing their tax code or via the self-assessment system.

Insurers generally won\u2019t let you pause your car insurance but you can cancel it and take a refund of the remaining months. You can tell the DVLA you are taking the car off the road with a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/make-a-sorn\">statutory off road notification (Sorn)</a> and cancel the policy. Check the savings and fees you will have to pay before you go ahead. You will also save the car tax for any full months it is off the road. But be aware that the vehicle has to be physically off the highway, on a driveway or similar. The big downside, of course, is that it will not be covered if it is stolen. </li> \n <li>Even if you still need a car, you may be using it less than when you bought your policy. Churchill and Direct Line are among the <strong>insurers</strong> offering refunds to drivers who are in this position. You need to get in touch with your new mileage during lockdown and they will give you cash back based on the difference between that number and the figure you declared when you bought the policy. Check if your insurer is doing the same. If it isn\u2019t but your policy is coming to an end, don\u2019t let it renew without adjusting the mileage you are paying for. </li> \n <li>If you no longer need a car you are buying on <strong>finance</strong>, you can hand it back, provided you have paid back at least half the money owed on it. Section 99 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 sets out how you can voluntarily terminate a regulated hire purchase or personal contract purchase (PCP) agreement. With a PCP, the buyer puts down a deposit, makes perhaps three or four years\u2019 monthly payments, and then a final balloon payment at the end of the term if they wish to keep the car. If you have paid half the value of the vehicle, you can ask for a voluntary termination. If you are near 50%, you can opt to pay the difference to get you there. You hand the car back and escape the rest of the payments. Be aware that no refunds are given if you paid more than 50%. Those with HP agreements can hand the car back sooner, typically halfway through the term, as there are no balloon payments. The <a href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/cut-your-car-finance-hire-purchase-and-other-finance-costs#when-should-i-end-my-finance-deal-early\">Money Advice Service website</a> has some good advice on the process. A voluntary termination will show up on your credit file but should not negatively affect your <a href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/how-to-improve-your-credit-rating\">credit score</a>, it says.</li> \n <li><strong>Bike</strong> sales have been soaring during the pandemic. You may want to consider buying a bike through your employer\u2019s cycle to work scheme, which will allow you to save 25-39% of the cost. Employees who sign up get a voucher, which they take to their local bike shop and use to buy their chosen equipment, including lights and clothing. The savings come through the fact that you don\u2019t pay income tax or national insurance on the purchase price. In reality, your employer buys a bike for you, and you \u201chire\u201d it back, making monthly payments from your gross (pre-tax) salary, typically over four years. Basic-rate taxpayers save a quarter on the cost of the bike and accessories. Higher-rate taxpayers save about 40%. Technically, the bike belongs to your employer until the end of the four years, at which point there is an ownership fee payable. Buy a decent lock and insurance, as the payments must still be made even if the machine has been stolen. You don\u2019t have to ride the bike to work to use the scheme but most new applicants will be planning to do just that. </li> \n <li><strong>Rail</strong> commuters who expect to carry on working from home can still apply for a rail season ticket refund, backdated up to 56 days. Passengers have to go back to the rail company that sold them it, either in person at the ticket office or online. Be aware that you will not get the cost of the annual ticket divided by 12, with each unused month returned. Refunds are calculated as the difference between the season ticket\u2019s cost, and that of the cheapest way to make the same journeys without it, using monthly, weekly or daily tickets. Use a refund calculator, such as<a href=\"https://www.southeasternrailway.co.uk/help-and-contact/get-in-touch/coronavirus-refund-information\"> the one</a> from Southeastern. Some passengers have received in excess of \u00a32,500 back. </li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"522231a534ff172aa32810c8555c92908639f5ef\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/522231a534ff172aa32810c8555c92908639f5ef/0_0_1359_2552/533.png\" alt=\"money\" width=\"533\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">money</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Ryan Gillert</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Change the way you pay</strong><br></h2> \n<ul> \n <li>Millions of older people left trapped in their homes after the coronavirus struck found that without an online <strong>bank account</strong>, day-to-day banking has been near-impossible. Halifax said the numbers of over-65s signing up for online banking has jumped by 63% and their use of contactless has also soared. Santander says the over-55s have flocked online during the pandemic, with numbers up 54%. Signing up for an online bank account is relatively easy. You don\u2019t have to have a smartphone but it helps. If not, use a home computer instead. Either try your existing bank or set up an account with one of the app-based providers such as Monzo, Starling and Revolut. </li> \n <li>The pandemic and physical distancing have already forced many of us to adapt our <strong>payment</strong> habits. If you haven\u2019t already, check out <a href=\"https://paym.co.uk/\">Paym</a>, the free service launched in 2014 that allows you to send or receive money with any UK mobile phone number without sharing your bank details. Industry body Pay.UK says it is safe and efficient, with 15 banks and building societies offering the service, including all the big ones. Watch out for fake messages, which have recently been impersonating Paym and asking customers to follow a link to receive money.</li> \n <li>We are highly likely to see many businesses closing their doors for good because of the coronavirus. From a consumer point of view, remember that paying by <strong>credit card</strong> gives you added legal protection if the company you are buying from goes bust. If you use your credit card to buy something costing more than \u00a3100 and up to \u00a330,000, you are covered by section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. This means the card company has equal responsibility with the seller if the company you bought from fails. If you pay with a debit card, you might be able to make a claim later for a refund under the <a href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/how-youre-protected-when-you-pay-by-card\">chargeback</a> scheme. This is an agreement the likes of Visa and Mastercard have signed up to. The card company will try to claim your money back from the company you have paid by reversing the transaction. Be aware that time limits apply for making a claim.</li> \n <li>Even though the lockdown is easing (with outdoor markets and car showrooms in England reopening from 1 June, and other non-essential retailers from 15 June), going to the <strong>shops</strong> is likely to remain a rigmarole. Physical distancing rules will restrict the number of people who can be in a store at any one time and shoppers will have to contend with closed changing rooms, restrictions on touching merchandise and one-way systems. If there are things you buy every time you go and you can afford to pay slightly more for them, you could consider looking into a subscription from an independent retailer. You can arrange regular deliveries of all kinds of foods, including ground coffee, cheese, bacon and wine. Away from the kitchen, some small book stores are offering to send you a book a month for a year. This is not likely to be a way to save money but will prevent you having to visit a shop and could help save a small business. </li> \n <li>Similarly, a <strong>milkman</strong> can help you cut out trips to the shops. Many deliver non-dairy substitutes as well as the traditional pint. The website <a href=\"https://www.findmeamilkman.net/\">Findmeamilkman.net</a> can help you find one that covers your area but it doesn\u2019t seem to be exhaustive so ask neighbours or use Google. Some of the larger companies such as <a href=\"https://www.milkandmore.co.uk/\">Milk &amp; More</a> carry other products, including bread, vegetables and drinks. </li> \n <li>In terms of <strong>returns and refunds</strong>, retailers have generally updated their policies since the start of the outbreak, allowing customers to return items after physical stores reopen and extending online returns periods. This is typically between one and two months. The consumer group Which? put pressure on laggard retailers, which were not being quite so generous. Your consumer rights are not affected by the disruption to retail caused by the outbreak, although refunds are taking longer to process as stores and their customer services staff buckle under the strain. </li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cc39d63feea95b7a65b3b0e6de10757b8075f1d0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc39d63feea95b7a65b3b0e6de10757b8075f1d0/0_0_1463_1508/970.png\" alt=\"hide\" width=\"970\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">hide</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Ryan Gillert</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Stashing your savings</strong></h2> \n<ul> \n <li>While the coronavirus crisis has been a financial disaster for many people, the bald truth is that many others are feeling better off at the moment because they are spending so little. If that is you, now\u2019s the time to build a <strong>financial safety cushion</strong> with some of the money you have saved as a result of the lockdown. Financial planners typically suggest we need three to six months\u2019 worth of expenses as a <a href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/emergency-savings-how-much-is-enough\">rainy day fund</a> but a study in 2018 found 70% of the UK\u2019s workers were \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jan/25/uk-workers-chronically-broke-study-economic-insecurity\">chronically broke</a>\u201d, with almost no proper savings. If you are lucky enough to have spare cash, channel it towards a savings account. The interest rate may not be great but by separating it from your everyday spending account, you will make it harder to access and force yourself to think twice before using the money. Check out <a href=\"https://moneyfacts.co.uk/savings-accounts/\">Moneyfacts.co.uk for the best rates on different types of accounts</a>. </li> \n <li>Rebuild your <strong>pension</strong> with some of that money you are not spending. According to adviser Kirsty Stone of The Private Office, if you are in your mid-40s and can afford to put an extra \u00a3100 a month into your pension, it could be worth an extra \u00a342,000 in terms of your pension pot by the time you are 65. If you can set aside an additional \u00a3250 a month, it could be worth an extra \u00a3100,000, using standard assumptions. You could also contact your HR department at work and ask them to increase the contributions that are taken from your pay. That way, you will receive either 20% or 40% tax relief, depending on your pay. If you are fortunate, you may find your company offers an additional voluntary contribution (AVC) scheme where it will match or partially match whatever you put in. But remember it\u2019s a pension so you can\u2019t access the money until you are at least 55. </li> \n</ul> \n<h2><strong>Catastrophe planning</strong></h2> \n<ul> \n <li>Make sure you have a <strong>will</strong> and it is up to date. Check in with older relatives too. The majority of Britons haven\u2019t made a will. However, some trade unions offer members free will-writing. So do several charities, including Cancer Research and the British Heart Foundation. These will work if your family setup is quite straightforward. If your financial or family situations are at all complicated, it will be worth paying for legal advice. Use the Law Society website <a href=\"https://solicitors.lawsociety.org.uk/\">solicitors.lawsociety.org.uk</a> to find a local solicitor. </li> \n <li>With foreign holidays and many other trips on hold, those lucky enough to have a garden will be spending a lot of time in it this year so it is not surprising that people are flocking to garden centres to invest in their outdoor space. But if you are splashing out on expensive barbecues, patio furniture and children\u2019s play equipment, dig out your <strong>home insurance</strong> to check you are covered. The average British garden contains \u00a31,457 worth of valuable items, according to MoneySuperMarket. But financial information firm Defaqto says about 10% of home insurance policies did not cover items left in the garden as standard. Of the policies that do offer cover, many have low limits for these items, typically \u00a31,000 or less, as outdoor space cannot be secured in the same way that a home is. Minimise the risk by bringing items inside or storing them in a locked shed or garage, where possible. If you have had to splash out on new technology to teach the kids, make sure your kit is covered by your home insurance policy. Lots of home insurance will cover all but the most expensive equipment as a matter of course but check the small print in case you need to increase your cover. If you are a renter and have never bothered to buy insurance for your belongings before, it may be worth doing so now. The price comparison sites will help you find a policy that suits you. </li> \n <li>The pandemic and its fallout have prompted many people to take another look at how much <strong>life insurance</strong> cover they have, with some companies saying many more younger people are buying it. Straightforward life insurance is still widely available and nearly all policies, even those taken out today, will pay out if the death is due to coronavirus. Note that the price rises steeply as you get older. We obtained a quote from Aviva this week where the cost was \u00a38.42 a month for a 37-year-old seeking a payout of \u00a3100,000 should they die in the next 15 years. But if the person was 57, the premium shot up to \u00a345.22 a month.</li> \n <li>If your concern is about losing your job and not being able to pay the monthly bills, things have become a lot tougher. Many of the big price comparison sites that sell insurance have stopped providing quotes for <strong>unemployment cover</strong>. You can in theory still obtain income protection cover that pays out if you become sick with coronavirus. We got quotes for an office worker aged in his mid- to late 30s, on an income of \u00a340,000 a year, which would pay an income of \u00a31,650 a month for the next 12 months. LV=, Royal London and Legal &amp; General all came back with quotes at about \u00a320-\u00a322 a month. It\u2019s crucial to check what the minimum amount of time is that you would have to be off sick to get a payout. Most policies don\u2019t cover short periods of illness \u2013 the minimum period can be a month, or a lot longer \u2013 so you would probably have to be ill with coronavirus for a very long time to get a payout.</li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7a1579f1bf1bca83376d6cf83d335f648f95e3ae\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a1579f1bf1bca83376d6cf83d335f648f95e3ae/0_0_959_2746/349.png\" alt=\"Coron\" width=\"349\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coron</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Ryan Gillert</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Other spending</strong></h2> \n<ul> \n <li>Review <strong>memberships and subscriptions</strong> to check you can still afford to pay them and are getting what you want. Some organisations, such as the Barbican arts complex in London, have already told their members they will be able to extend their membership by the length of the closure for free. Most gyms have frozen memberships while closed, with no fee to pay until the clubs reopen. With some teetering on the edge of bankruptcy and no guarantee there will not be another lockdown later in the year, you may want to opt for monthly payments rather than paying for a year upfront. David Lloyd, which has 100 tennis and racquet clubs in the UK, is gradually reopening but only for outdoor tennis. It has decided to maintain its freeze on membership fees until its clubs are fully open but has not announced what will happen next. The National Trust is a charity and is keen for members to continue to donate to support its work. It says for a limited period only, it is letting members have a 25% discount when they renew their annual membership. </li> \n <li>Parents who use government schemes to get tax breaks on nurseries, childminders and after-school clubs will have been accruing money in their accounts while not being able to use those services. Insurer Royal London estimates \u00a318m could be sitting in tax-free <strong>childcare accounts</strong>. This is money parents can withdraw if they need it. The older childcare vouchers cannot be refunded but if you have this type of account, you can suspend payments while you are not using it. To stay in the scheme, you need to start them again within 52 weeks. </li> \n</ul> \n<h2><strong>The new workplace</strong></h2> \n<ul> \n <li>If you are going to be <strong>working from home</strong> for several more months, as seems to be the case for many of us, it\u2019s vital you have the right equipment, such as a suitable chair and desk, to ensure a healthy and productive work environment. <a href=\"https://www.iwfm.org.uk/resource/iwfm-research-hygiene-concerns-leave-thousands-anxious-about-return-to-the-office.html?parentId=8CBD03AD-C979-4553-AB9AAA1F0AB1081A\">Research</a> from the Institute of Workplace and Facilities Management earlier this month found just under a quarter (24%) of the employees it questioned had a separate home office, with almost two-thirds (64%) resorting to makeshift workstations on dining room tables, sofas and beds. Some employers are going as far as couriering a van full of kit to their home-working staff, while others are doing little or nothing. Royal Bank of Scotland said this month it will distribute additional gear such as office chairs, folding desks and screens to those who need it. Meanwhile, the BBC said staff can apply for an interest-free loan of up to \u00a3250 (with repayments deducted from net salary), which they can use to buy modest equipment to help them work from home more comfortably. Ask your employer what it can do to help you. Which? has <a href=\"https://www.which.co.uk/news/2020/04/coronavirus-9-tips-for-a-healthy-and-effective-lockdown-home-office/\">published a helpful list of tips</a>, which also includes recommendations for home office chairs and desks.</li> \n <li>You may be able to claim <strong>tax relief</strong> for your job expenses now that you are working from home. You can typically only claim for things that are solely related to your work \u2013 for example, business phone calls or the extra cost of gas and electricity for your \u201coffice\u201d area. You can\u2019t claim for things you use for both your work and in a private capacity, such as your broadband. Accountants Blick Rothenberg point out HMRC allows employees who don\u2019t already complete a self-assessment tax return to make claims of up to \u00a32,500 on employment-related expenses incurred in a tax year by using form P87. Check out HMRC\u2019s website for more information. The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/tax-relief-for-employees\">gov.uk/tax-relief-for-employees</a> page includes sections on working from home and buying substantial equipment that you have to have to do your work. This page on form P87 may also be useful.</li> \n <li>Is your home <strong>broadband</strong> up to scratch? Don\u2019t put up with a shoddy service. If yours is limping along at the moment, there are things you can do. You may want to ask your existing provider whether it can upgrade you to a faster fibre package without any loss of service or the need for an engineer visit. And there are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/apr/11/boost-broadband-speed-during-lockdown-wifi-internet\">various tips and gadgets</a> that might help. Switching broadband provider is of course an option, and may be the best bet for some. Most people won\u2019t require a home visit from an engineer. Comparethemarket.com recently said there had been considerable demand for faster broadband packages since the lockdown restrictions began.</li> \n <li>In terms of other homeworking costs, try to make use of the <strong>technology</strong> available for business calls and meetings \u2013 Zoom, Skype and so on \u2013 rather than racking up phone costs that, with all the chaos, you may never get around to claiming back.</li> \n <li>Strictly speaking, everyone should probably notify their <strong>buildings and contents insurer(s)</strong> if they are going to be working at home for a while \u2013 particularly if they have bought expensive new gear to help them do their job. Similarly, you are responsible for checking that working from home will not cause any problems with your mortgage or tenancy agreement.</li> \n</ul>",
  "<p>Temperatures in some California cities this week broke decades-old records. The heatwave that cooked Las Vegas over the past few days brought temperatures over 100F. And in Phoenix, highs this weekend are expected to approach or exceed 110F.&nbsp;</p> <p>This year is on track to be one of the hottest on record, and public health officials worry that in cities across the US, summer heatwaves will collide with the coronavirus pandemic, with deadly consequences for poor, minority and older populations.&nbsp;</p> <p>Even before the pandemic hit, heat was killing more Americans than all other natural disasters combined. People who live in cities are especially vulnerable to heatwaves because of a phenomenon called the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/feb/21/urban-heat-islands-cooling-things-down-with-trees-green-roads-and-fewer-cars\">\u201curban heat island effect\u201d</a> \u2013&nbsp;cities with populations of 1 million or more can be up to 5F hotter than surrounding areas due to high population density, a lack of greenery and shade, and because materials like steel, concrete and asphalt tend to absorb more heat.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/feb/21/urban-heat-islands-cooling-things-down-with-trees-green-roads-and-fewer-cars\">Urban heat islands: cooling things down with trees, green roads and fewer cars</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/09/03/754044732/as-rising-heat-bakes-u-s-cities-the-poor-often-feel-it-most\">Analyses</a> have also found that cities\u2019 poorest neighborhoods tend to be <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/12/htm\">hotter</a>, and that many low-income families have been struggling to cope for years. In some neighborhoods of Los Angeles, New York and Chicago, up to a third or more of households lack air conditioning. Due to the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, many more are unable to pay to run their ACs. And even as cities begin reopening after lockdown, many of the malls, public libraries and recreation centers where overheated Americans traditionally went to cool down remain risky, especially for older people and others with a heightened risk of dying from Covid-19.&nbsp;</p> <p>Throughout the country, public health officials told the Guardian they were scrambling to find ways to protect the most vulnerable from the dual threats of heat and coronavirus. \u201cThis summer is definitely not going to be like any other summer,\u201d said Deanne Criswell, the commissioner of New York City Emergency Management. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to have the same level of facilities open that New Yorkers typically go to all the time to stay cool. It\u2019s a big concern.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>New York is in the process of installing 74,000 air conditioners in the homes of low-income seniors, according to Criswell. The city is also seeking to help more people pay for electricity this summer, as the unemployment crisis leaves thousands of New Yorkers without the means to make rent and utilities. Other cities across the US have asked utility companies not to shut off service this summer, even if customers can\u2019t pay bills, so that they have access to water, cooling and refrigeration through the hottest days.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cEvery summer we worry about the heat when it ramps up \u2013 especially in April and May before people have a chance to acclimatize,\u201d said Carolyn Levering, the emergency management administrator for Las Vegas.&nbsp;\u201cI think it just gives us extra concern this year because of the pandemic.\u201d</p> <p>In Las Vegas, Phoenix and Los Angeles, officials are keeping some cooling centers \u2013 designated public buildings where residents come for cold water and a respite from the heat \u2013 open, at a reduced capacity so people can maintain social distancing while seeking relief from the heat. At five cooling centers in LA, anyone who enters has their temperature checked and is required to wear a mask and remain 6ft away from other people. In Nevada\u2019s Clark county, which includes Las Vegas, four cooling centers stayed open during the most recent heatwave.&nbsp;</p> <p>But none of these solutions are broad enough to catch everyone at risk of dying from heatstroke, advocates say. \u201cHell no, it isn\u2019t enough,\u201d said Jonathan Parfrey, the executive director of the LA-based non-profit Climate Resolve. \u201cThis is just a staggering problem.\u201d&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78d430620b592a058025524cd4aa66107e27ed7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78d430620b592a058025524cd4aa66107e27ed7a/0_176_5275_3165/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People sit inside social distancing markers at Domino Park in Brooklyn this week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People sit inside social distancing markers at Domino Park in Brooklyn this week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xinhua/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In South LA, where 64% of residents fall below the poverty line, more than 40% of households lack air conditioning, according to a study published this month by researchers at the University of Southern California who analyzed data from the electrical meters of nearly 180,500 households. \u201cPoverty was a better predictor of whether or not people had AC than even how hot or cool it was in a neighborhood,\u201d said Kelly Sanders, one of study\u2019s authors.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/epidem/Fulltext/2018/11000/Equitable_Access_to_Air_Conditioning__A_City.1.aspx\">vast majority</a> of these heat-related deaths in cities occur inside homes that aren\u2019t air-conditioned, said New York\u2019s Criswell.</p> <p>\u201cThat ain\u2019t going to be me this year,\u201d said Collette McCoy-Douglas, 67, a retired nurse who lives in a public housing facility for seniors in Chicago.

  "<p>Poggio Mirteto, Cantalupo, Casperia, Vacone, Configni, Stroncone. Hilltop towns in the ancient land of Sabina, calling to each other across parched patchworks of vineyard and cornfield. Woods, orchards, olive groves. You could drive to these places, of course. But my experience is, when you arrive on foot they are different. They are better. And best of all in summer.</p> <p>You\u2019ll need water with you at all times for this adventure. A light backpack with just one change of clothes. Trekking shoes on your feet, poles in your hands, sweat-wicking shirts and shorts and underwear. Plus a broad-brimmed hat, shades and a big tube of sun cream. Then just surrender yourself to the heat and the cicadas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8a38d2298367c6e1bb25edcd3d351df04bbcacba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a38d2298367c6e1bb25edcd3d351df04bbcacba/0_0_1478_1016/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Italy travel map\" width=\"1000\" height=\"687\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The start is simple enough. An hour\u2019s rattly train ride north-east beside the Tiber, from Rome\u2019s Tiburtina station to Poggio Mirteto Scalo. Then a four-mile climb, cross-country, to Poggio Mirteto proper. This will get you used to the idea that every place you\u2019re going to arrive at in the coming days is at the top of a long, steep slope. In fact, <em>poggio</em> means little hill. I remember a chalky track between dry thistles so tall their thistledown waved above our heads. You enter the town through a narrow stone arch perched above a sheer drop. Already you can look down and feel satisfied.</p> <p>The key to walking in heat is to start before dawn and ease into it. So check out Poggio the afternoon you arrive, then early to bed and wake at five. Piazza Martiri della Libert\u00e0 is dustily decorous, more an elongated, tree-lined oval than a square. Creamy baroque church at one end and austere brick cathedral at the other. Pretty facades, patches of green. A vigorous yucca tree thrusts out of 15th-century masonry. At the elegant tables of <a href=\"http://www.torrefazionecaffegentili.it/\">Caff\u00e9 Gentili</a> you can practise ordering a first <em>cedrata</em>. Made from Calabrian <em>cedro</em>, a large yellow citrus fruit, and served in a small bottle that you pour yourself on to crackling ice, this drink is sharp, thirst-quenching ecstasy. You\u2019ll be needing it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f31f05b9c99649531205ea5d6a83e6cc933226c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f31f05b9c99649531205ea5d6a83e6cc933226c2/780_209_4477_2688/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Poggio Mirteto.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Poggio Mirteto.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Valerio Mei/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One last requirement. It\u2019s hard to find detailed paper maps in Italy. Nor is the countryside thick with fingerposts pointing the way. If you\u2019re going to avoid the roads, you need a hiking app to find the paths \u2013 they\u2019re easily available. And it\u2019s wise to plan at least the start of each day\u2019s route the night before; then, when you close the door of your B&amp;B at an ungodly hour, you\u2019ll know where you\u2019re going.</p> <p>There\u2019s a special intimacy to slipping out of medieval walls while it\u2019s still night. Thankfully, the day starts downhill. The deep shadows of the trees are furtive and fresh, the grass dewy, air balmy, and all around an atmosphere of quiet vegetable pressure toward the splendour of the rising sun.</p> <p>Which comes all too soon. Towards seven the light is suddenly sharp over a stand of feathery bamboo. It\u2019s warming fast. At a corner, an enormous agave plant waves grey-green tentacles. Sunflowers raise their heads. In the orchards the peaches begin to glow. Then around 8:30, as if a switch were tripped, the cicadas begin. One strikes up in a tree right above, a rasping rhythmic whir, then another and another and another, until a harsh, hypnotic chorus fuses with the now oven-hot air in one vast summery stupefaction.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1cf5c3dd5d6b99ff7f062984176d925a9eaabbb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cf5c3dd5d6b99ff7f062984176d925a9eaabbb4/53_0_5314_3192/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The undulating terrain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The undulating terrain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victor Harris/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We\u2019re walking north here, in a broad, undulating valley, through fields of scorched stubble watched from towers and castles on the hills each side. At the end of the valley is the larger town of Terni, two days away, offering the option of a train back to Rome. But if you have appetite and energy, it\u2019s just another two days north to Todi, taking in the grand Roman ruin of Carsulae and the pretty town of Acquasparta. Then perhaps another two west to Orvieto. Or north to Perugia and the upper Tiber valley. My partner and I did this walk as part of a longer trip, following in the footsteps of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Garibaldi\">Garibaldi</a> when he tried to march an army from Rome to Venice after the collapse of the liberal Roman republic in 1849. This segment seemed the most intensely Italian, and the least known.</p> <p>But this morning\u2019s first goal is Cantalupo. You have to lift your head to see it, a mass of piled muddled stone rising from gnarled trees far above. The slope is scandalously steep. But the pleasure of these days lies in an intensity of contrasts: first the sweat and strain, then the solace each small town affords. The water fountain by the ancient gate. The coolness in dark churches and resiny smells under gnarled pines. Fortunately, it\u2019s rarely more than three hours\u2019 march between one settlement and the next. You\u2019ll be in Cantalupo\u2019s main square in ample time for freshly squeezed orange juice, cappuccino and croissant, under sunshades, surrounded by a blaze of potted oleanders. It would never have felt so good had you arrived by car.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When Garibaldi passed this spring in 1849 it was dry, and his men, mules and horses went crazy with thirst</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We had set our sights on Vacone as a place to stay, taking time out for lunch in Casperia, another climb to another miracle of the middle ages paralysed in the day\u2019s blue dazzle. Then our app let us down: a path petered into nothing. We turned back. It was past evening when we tackled a rutted track that climbs a thousand feet. There\u2019s a stone trough here, set in the cliff beside the path, and the words of an ode that the poet Horace wrote, more than 2,000 years ago, in praise of the water that springs from the rock. \u201cO fountain of Bandusia!\u201d When Garibaldi passed in 1849 the spring was dry and his men, mules and horses went crazy with thirst.</p> <p>Our water was finished too. But we were almost there. The track turns into cobbled alleys, then a broad terrace beneath an ancient clock tower. Vacone. Two women were sitting on the parapet, a vast sunset panorama behind them. Was there anywhere to stay, we asked. No. Was there a cafe? No. Really, no cafe? There was a bar, they said, that opened after dinner, \u201cFor the men to play cards.\u201d And a tiny grocery.</p> <p>I mention this moment to warn you that you should decide before setting out whether you are up for a night in the open. Whether to take a light tent, perhaps. We had one, but Eleonora, my partner, had read that there were wolves in these hills. Of course no one has been killed by a wolf in Italy for more than 200 years. Wild boars and dogs are more likely encounters. But the imagination is a terrible thing. Wry and generous, the two women phoned all their friends and relatives. Did anyone know anyone who had a place to stay? Children ran back and forth. The grocery provided beer and mozzarella. Finally a B&amp;B was found, another 40 minutes\u2019 walking, in the dark.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9b81d255182f3bcd7151c3ce61e590ee5d93f3f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b81d255182f3bcd7151c3ce61e590ee5d93f3f1/0_185_5890_3534/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Casperia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Casperia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Valerio Mei/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On arrival, every day, you must plunge your walking clothes in the sink and wash them at once. They\u2019ll dry in the night and be ready for the dawn. In bed you feel your body glowing, ripe with summer sun.</p> <p>Some towns offer evening entertainment. Carmina Burana on the steps of a Duomo. A beauty contest under a <em>loggiato</em>. In one village a magician. In another a one-man band. And yes, there are artworks to look at along the way. If you must. A fine San Sebastiano, for example, cheerfully resigned to his arrows above the altar of a tiny church on cobbled streets heading to Configni. But this holiday is not about frescoes and monuments; rather, it\u2019s about the pleasure of eating <em>cappellacci</em> with radicchio and <em>robiola</em> cheese behind bead curtains in Configni\u2019s one osteria. Then the fragrance of lavender and mint as we plunge back down to the valley; the elegance of the bulrushes and the blue of the cornflowers; the distant braying of a donkey.</p> <p>Vacone to Terni via Configni and the magnificent Stroncone is 27 breathtakingly beautiful, backbreakingly arduous kilometres. There\u2019s a stream to ford, with slimy stones under your toes. At burning midday, in a lane sunk between high banks of bush and bramble, near a place called Coppe, you may stumble upon the miracle of a <em>lavatoio</em>, two long stone basins for washing clothes, brimming with dark water. If you find it, take off your socks and shoes, sit on the edge and plunge in your burning feet. A plaque on the wall beside says that <em>per fatale disgrazia</em> \u2013 through fatal misfortune \u2013 Virgilio Giusti died here in 1948, aged 18, in the flower of youth. Italians love these sad memorials, flowers forever refreshed at the point where a foot slipped or lightning struck. There will be a name, a date, a few words. They spin a sticky web of sentiment across the landscape, and remind you, as this whole trip should, how lucky you are to be alive in a world where there is Italy and summer and freedom.</p>",

He is abusing the past to distort the present, in order to control the future. But the past is not as malleable as Fox News.</p> <p>The symmetries between the past Kushner seeks to exploit and the discreditable present are striking. If there is any resemblance of the Trump mutation of the Republican party to any actual party in the election of 1856 it is not to the Republicans. Nor is it to the Democrats. Rather, it is to the third party in that campaign, the American party, also known as the Know Nothings, who also had a concise platform.&nbsp;</p> <p>The original American party sought to protect the purity of white native-born Protestants from the first great wave of immigration to the United States, which consisted mostly of the Irish and Germans, and to stigmatize a subversive religion.</p> <p>\u201cAmericans must rule America,\u201d its platform proclaimed. Only native-born citizens should be allowed to hold any public office, federal, state or municipal. Catholics, described in the category of those pledging \u201callegiance or obligation of any description to any foreign prince, potentate or power\u201d, were to be proscribed.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Know Nothings emerged from the crack-up of the Whig party over the issue of the extension of slavery in the territories. Most regarded themselves as Old Whigs, \u201cconservatives in principle\u201d in the words of their party platform. Their standard-bearer was Millard Fillmore, the last Whig president, a decorous figurehead. The Democrats nominated James Buchanan, a northern man of southern sympathy, a distinguished former senator from Pennsylvania, the crucial swing state.</p> <p>Abraham Lincoln, a lifelong Whig, forged the Illinois Republican party in 1856 out of a cacophony of contending factions, including radical abolitionists, Whigs, dissident antislavery Democrats and liberal German immigrants. Lincoln despised Know Nothingism.</p> <p>In 1855, he wrote that if the movement ever won power it would rewrite the Declaration of Independence: \u201cWhen the Know-Nothings get control, it will read \u2018all men are created equal, except negroes, and foreigners, and Catholics.\u2019 When it comes to this I should prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretense of loving liberty \u2013 to Russia, for instance, where despotism can be taken pure, and without the base alloy of hypocrisy.\u201d</p> <p>Behind the scenes, Lincoln worked to undermine the Know Nothings, break up their party and bring some of its former Whig adherents to his new cause. In order to hold together their fragile coalition, Lincoln in Illinois and Republicans nationally advanced the singular goal of prohibiting slavery in the territories.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Republican presidential candidate in 1856, John C Fremont, was a famous western explorer and senator from California. Both the \u201cAmericans\u201d and the Democrats mounted vicious smear campaigns against him: that he was not native-born but of foreign birth, illegitimate and a secret Catholic. \u201cTrial by mud,\u201d his wife Jessie Benton Fremont called it.</p> <p>Two years later, running for the Senate, Lincoln declared that immigrants who believe in the Declaration of Independence\u2019s precept that \u201call men are created equal\u201d are \u201cour equals in all things \u2026 as though they were blood of the blood, and flesh of the flesh of the men who wrote that Declaration, and so they are. That is the electric cord in that Declaration that links the hearts of patriotic and liberty-loving men together.\u201d&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2a5c67391068d75e657d0162c306f816ffbe747\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2a5c67391068d75e657d0162c306f816ffbe747/0_0_5100_3883/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A banner for the American party\u2019s 1856 presidential candidate, Millard Fillmore.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"761\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A banner for the American party\u2019s 1856 presidential candidate, Millard Fillmore.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal History Archive/UIG via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 1856 Republican platform may provide another piece of symmetry to the modern day.

But all of that disappeared when Somalia was engulfed by civil war.</p> <p>\u201cBullets flew from one side of the conflict to the other,\u201d Omar writes, \u201c\u2026 directly over our house\u201d. The house took direct hits, food became scarce and 350,000 died in the first year of the conflict.</p> <p>Omar\u2019s family was forced to the oceanside town of Kismayo, where she was told that her father and brothers were dead.&nbsp;But the next day she followed what she thought was her father\u2019s voice, \u201cand toward the end of the stretch where everyone was sleeping, there he was \u2026 I put my hand on his face, just to make sure he was real.&nbsp;And he was.\u201d Her brothers were alive, too.</p> <p>They fled to Kenya, where they faced malaria, dysentery and near starvation. The family survived in a refugee camp for 334,000 people, bartering kidney beans for kerosene and batteries for a radio.&nbsp;When she needed entertainment, Omar snuck under the barbed wire to walk to a nearby village, where an enterprising Kenyan charged a few shillings to watch movies on his TV.&nbsp;When six children who were distant relatives lost both their parents, Omar\u2019s family looked after them, Ilhan paying special attention to the baby, Umi.</p> <p>Her father discovered that they could apply through the United Nations to go to Norway, Canada or Sweden. But the US was his first choice.</p> <p>\u201cOnly in America you ultimately become an American,\u201d he said. \u201cEverywhere else we will always feel like a guest.\u201d</p> <p>Miraculously, a year after their first interview they were allowed to apply&nbsp;for America. Ilhan was upset, partly because the orphans couldn\u2019t come with them, but the rest of her book is the astonishing story of a&nbsp;voyage&nbsp;from Nairobi to New York to Minnesota, then barely 20 years later to Congress.</p> <p>The family\u2019s first stop was Arlington, Virginia, where the combative Ilhan spent most of her time in detention.&nbsp;But then she decided, she writes, \u201cthat my education was the one element of my life I had full control over, and given the long hours of studying in detention\u201d, by the time they moved on to Minnesota she \u201chad become a very good student\u201d.</p> <p>At her new school, \u201cAfricans fought African Americans over who was blacker.&nbsp;Muslim kids and white kids fought over US policy in the Middle East.&nbsp;Latinos against African Americans, Africans against Native Americans.\u201d</p> <p>But Ilhan began to display her talents as a community organizer.&nbsp;She joined a group of students determined to \u201cimprove racial and cultural relations\u201d by founding Unity in Diversity, \u201cessentially a training program around diverse leadership\u201d.</p> <p>Her next stop was North Dakota State University, after a friend told her it was searching for students, offering scholarships and a \u201cvery low cost of living\u201d. Back in Minneapolis after graduation, she immersed herself in the Democratic Farmer-Labor party, first working to defeat ballot initiatives to require photo IDs for voters and to outlaw gay marriage.&nbsp;</p> <p>She figured out a winning narrative: both were threats to freedom and civil liberties, a message that worked with communities of color <em>and</em> white rural Minnesotans.&nbsp;No anti-marriage equality initiative had ever been beaten until then \u2013 the same year Barack Obama was elected president.</p> <p>Omar was elected to the state legislature in 2016, then to the US Congress in 2018, as one of the first two Muslim women in the House.&nbsp;She feared she would be banned from the House floor by an ancient rule barring hats, which would have prevented her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/03/ilhan-omar-hijab-congress-headwear\">wearing her hijab</a>.

They sit a short distance apart in Juukan Gorge, about 60km from the mining town of Tom Price, on the edge of the multibillion-dollar Brockman 4 iron ore mine.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/26/rio-tinto-blasts-46000-year-old-aboriginal-site-to-expand-iron-ore-mine\">Rio Tinto blasts 46,000-year-old Aboriginal site to expand iron ore mine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Juukan two is one of the only sites on the Pilbara to show continual human occupation through the last ice age, and archeological records, including bone pits that catalogued changing fauna, dated back 46,000 years.</p> <p>The sites were drilled and set with explosives last week. Traditional owners the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) peoples don\u2019t yet know the full extent of the damage.</p> <p>The operation had been discussed at meetings with Rio Tinto over a number of years, but Burchell Hayes, one of the directors of the PKKP Aboriginal Corporation, says those meetings often conveyed technical information which PKKP elders found hard to interpret. He says the \u201cblunt details\u201d that would have helped them understand exactly what was being proposed, and when, was lacking.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThe sadness and the loss of our country has been very distressing,\u201d Hayes said.</p> <p>Rio Tinto says the \u201cmining activity\u201d conducted this month was \u201cundertaken in accordance with all necessary approvals\u201d, which had been obtained following a decade of \u201cdetailed consultation\u201d with the PKKP.</p> <p>\u201cWe are sorry that the recently expressed concerns of the PKKP did not arise through the engagements that have taken place over many years under the agreement that governs our operations on their country,\u201d a company statement says.</p> <p>The PKKP Aboriginal Corporation rejected that statement on Saturday, saying they had told Rio Tinto of the importance of the site on a number of occasions since 2013, the last as recently as March.</p> <p>Hayes said the mining company did not advise the PKKP of its intention to blast, and they only found out \u201cby default\u201d on 15 May \u201cwhen we sought access to the area for Naidoc Week in July\u201d.</p> <p>On a site visit in October 2019, Hayes said, their cultural and heritage manager, Dr Heather Builth, told a senior manager from the mine that the rock shelters were significant.</p> <p>\u201c[He] advised Dr Builth that there were no plans to extend the mine and Rio Tinto had been monitoring Juukan Gorge for vibration effects of local blasting,\u201d Hayes said.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cAt all times the PKKPAC has been direct and explicit in the archaeological and ethnographic significance of these rock shelters and the importance that they be preserved. For Rio Tinto to suggest otherwise is incorrect.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe Rio Tinto\u2019s outrageous statement is a bid to minimise the adverse public reaction and community outrage about Sunday\u2019s blast at Juukan Gorge; and the distress and upset caused to the Puutu Kunti Kurrama people.\u201d</p> <p>The WA Aboriginal affairs minister, Ben Wyatt, says he is normally \u201ccontacted pretty rapidly by the relevant Aboriginal organisation\u201d when a heritage site is under imminent threat, but was not called in this case.</p> <p>\u201cThe first I heard about this was after the explosion,\u201d Wyatt told reporters in Perth.</p> <p>The federal Indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt, says he received an 11th hour call from lawyers for the PKKP advising him of the risk and asking for advice, and that he advised them to seek an injunction under federal heritage legislation.</p> <p>He did not take it further or intervene, but said in a statement after the blast that the \u201cdestruction should not have occurred\u201d.</p> <p>Even if Ben Wyatt had known, there are no legal levers under the current legislation that allow for ministerial intervention. Wyatt has promised to reform the laws but consultation on that reform has been slow and was put off again last month due to the coronavirus.</p> <p>It is now highly unlikely the WA government will have those new laws drafted and through parliament before the state election next March.</p> <p>Robin Chapple, a Greens MP who campaigned alongside Wyatt to reform the legislation when Labor was in opposition, says Wyatt has \u201cfound himself to be incredibly compromised\u201d by the conflicting responsibilities of protecting Aboriginal heritage, as Aboriginal affairs minister, and supporting its most significant industry as the state\u2019s treasurer.</p> <p>\u201cYou cannot have one person who is pushing the state in the pursuit of mining \u2026 being the same person that has to represent the interests of Aboriginal people to protect the excesses of the mining industry from destroying their sites,\u201d Chapple says.</p> <p>In response, Wyatt says he acts \u201cin the interests of all Western Australians when carrying out my ministerial responsibilities\u201d and that his dual portfolios \u201conly elevates the significance of Aboriginal affairs within this government\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/19/fertiliser-plant-is-not-damaging-burrup-peninsula-rock-art-epa-says\">Fertiliser plant is not damaging Burrup Peninsula rock art, EPA says</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>How did this happen?</h2> <p>Negotiations over the protection of Juukan Gorge began in 2003. In 2005, Hamersley Iron, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rio Tinto, applied for environmental approval to build a new iron ore mine dubbed Brockman 4.</p> <p>Documents submitted as part of that assessment process said it had found 27 archaeological sites within the project area: mostly rock shelters with some artefact scatters, water sources and scarred trees.</p> <p>It said that identified Aboriginal heritage sites \u201cmay need to be either disturbed or actively managed\u201d for the mine to proceed but that \u201cit is not anticipated that the project will adversely impact on any areas of ethnographic significance\u201d.</p> <p>In 2008, the archaeologist Dr Michael Slack was engaged to conduct a test dig in the large rock shelter known as Juukan two, and concluded it was a \u201cquite significant\u201d site that was about 20,000 years old.</p> <p>In 2013, Rio Tinto applied for and was granted ministerial consent under <a href=\"http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/wa/consol_act/aha1972164/s18.html\">section 18 of the Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972</a> to destroy Juukan one and two, as part of the expansion of its proposed Brockman 4 mine, which had become operational three years earlier.</p> <p>The minister who provided that consent was Peter Collier, a member of the Barnett Liberal government that was in power at the time. But it\u2019s unlikely he knew the details of what he signed off on, Chapple says.</p> <p>All applications are assessed by the Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Committee, which then provides a recommendation with scant detail to the minister.</p> <p>There is no legislated requirement for the ACHC to consult traditional owners. In 2015, the committee was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/apr/02/landmark-wa-judgement-on-aboriginal-sacred-sites-prompts-call-for-review\">chastised by the supreme court for using an invalid definition of sacred sites that explicitly excluded sites that were part of songlines</a>.</p> <p>In 2014, after permission to destroy the site had been granted, a salvage mission dated the Juukan two site at 46,000 years old and of very high archaeological and cultural significance. One year later the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura were granted native title over the area, and a 10,888sq km patch of the Hamersley range.</p> <p>That gave them the right to negotiate over any new developments, and to make financial agreements with mining companies profiting from their land. But it did not confer any legal ability to protect heritage sites, unless negotiated as part of a land use agreement.</p> <p>Those land use agreements are designed to foster closer relationships between industry and Aboriginal peoples, like the relationship that Rio says it has with the PKKP. The relationship is both financial and institutional, and can make it difficult to take a disagreement over a matter like the protection of a heritage site into a public arena.</p> <p>But because of the lack of power granted to traditional owners under the WA Aboriginal Heritage Act, a public fight is the only mechanism left to traditional owners to defend heritage if negotiation fails.</p> <p>Chapple says the financial ties between traditional owner corporations and the mining companies that threaten their heritage are well known, but rarely discussed.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s particularly corrupt, I just think we need to know that there are relationships that can be used to the benefit of the mining companies,\u201d Chapple says. \u201cYou get this in small communities, and Western Australia is a small community.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/apr/02/landmark-wa-judgement-on-aboriginal-sacred-sites-prompts-call-for-review\">Landmark WA judgment on Aboriginal sacred sites prompts call for review</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>An antiquated law</h2> <p>The Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972 has been relatively unchanged for almost 50 years and does not give traditional owners any formal right of consultation or appeal.&nbsp;</p> <p>In his second reading speech in April 1972, the then minister for community welfare, Bill Willessee, said the legislation had been drafted because \u201cthe preservation of sites and objects of Aboriginal origin is now recognised throughout Australia as an important aspect of providing Aboriginal citizens with the social environment that they need when they still retain partly or wholly their traditional beliefs\u201d.</p> <p>This speech proved more enlightened than the resulting legislation, says Greg McIntyre SC, a leading expert on Aboriginal heritage cases.</p> <p>He says that had the legislation included a strong emphasis on spiritual value as a basis for heritage protection, he would be \u201creasonably happy\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is that the legislation doesn\u2019t even do that,\u201d he says.&nbsp;</p> <p>Under the current legislation, McIntyre says, the only legal option for traditional owners who oppose a decision allowing the destruction of their heritage lies in administrative law, an argument that due process has not been followed. That does not in itself halt a development, but it does cause delays.</p> <p>\u201cAdministrative relief is like guerrilla warfare in that you hope it will slow people down and they will be forced to rethink it, but it doesn\u2019t really get to the key issues of whether it\u2019s affecting Aboriginal heritage or the environment,\u201d McIntyre says.</p> <p>Even if the act is reformed, McIntyre says, the economic importance of the mining industry made it likely that the focus would remain on finding a compromise between heritage and industry.</p> <p>\u201cThe best legislation I think we\u2019re likely to get is legislation that has a heavy emphasis on involving Aboriginal people in the decision making, but with the understanding that ultimately they will be expected at best to go into partnership with those that wish to extract minerals rather than prevent that from happening,\u201d he says.</p> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 4 June 2020 to correct the date&nbsp;the&nbsp;PKKP Aboriginal Corporation found out about the plan to blast the site, and the date of the site visit in which Rio Tinto was informed of its significance.</p></li> </ul>"
