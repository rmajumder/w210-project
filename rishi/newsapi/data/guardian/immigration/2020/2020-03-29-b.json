For over 80% of people these symptoms are mild, for the much smaller number who develop the most serious illness, intensive care is needed around 10 days later.</p> \n  <p>\u201cFor those who do not recover but die, data from China suggests this takes around another four days.

Paused in several states last week when it was reported a jockey had been tested for Covid-19, thoroughbred racing resumed in time for the weekend\u2019s autumn carnival action after Mark Zahra returned a negative. The duty-of-care concerns attached to an industry that depends on animals aside, the continuation of racing is a godsend for the hundreds of thousands of people who either work in the industry or invest in it. And for those who follow it.</p> <p>The situation is far grimmer in the UK. With all sport and racing now halted, industries have been decimated and multitudes left out of work.</p> <p>The Racing Post, the daily bible of British horse racing and sports betting, has ceased production of its newspaper during the outbreak and is only publishing its digital edition. There isn\u2019t much to write about. In its popular \u2018What to watch on Saturday\u2019 column, readers were pointed to Australian horse racing, the Belarusian Premier League (of course) and a re-run of Minder, with the connection being that the actor playing the leading role was a fan of horse racing.</p> <p>These are indeed challenging times, with no end in immediate view.

  "<p>Up to 2,100 refugees in Calais and Dunkirk are facing an imminent coronavirus lockdown by French authorities, with many saying they will try to reach the UK rather than go to accommodation centres if their camps are cleared.</p> \n<p>Buses will be sent to the camps to transfer refugees to centres housing up to 100 people from Tuesday. The transfers are said to be voluntary but some of the refugees told the Guardian that they distrust the police and are fearful of being forced into the centres, so plan to run away and continue in their attempts to cross the Channel.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"34c5dc3a-6353-49e9-b613-d60927312a76\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Why did Calais become a staging post?</b><br></p>\n    <p>Refugees have been gathering in Calais on their way to the UK for decades. Periodically the French authorities attempt to prevent them from coming but asylum seekers continue to arrive. Some pay people-smugglers to get them into lorries parked near the port while those who have no money try to conceal themselves in moving trucks.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Who travels to camps on the Channel? </b></p>\n    <p>Many asylum seekers have relatives or friends in the UK or have some level of English language skills. But the 1,000 or so refugees currently living in Calais and Dunkirk represent a very small proportion of refugees seeking asylum across Europe.<br></p>\n    <p>Although the situation in Northern France attracts attention because it is at the UK border, the numbers gathered here are tiny compared with the 100,000- plus who arrived in Europe in 2017, the vast majority of whom intend to claim asylum elsewhere in Europe.</p>\n    <p><b>What are politicians doing to change the situation?</b></p>\n    <p>The British government has contributed to a \u00a317m joint Anglo-French package of security measures, including the construction of a 1km-long concrete wall, aimed at preventing asylum seekers from getting close lorries arriving at the port.</p>\n    <p>But charities say extra security does not prevent the arrival of new refugees. They want the British government to make it easier for vulnerable unaccompanied children to travel legally and for France to accept that there will always be some refugees in Calais, and provide dignified reception centres.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Conditions in the camps are worsening, with shortages of food, water and showers as NGOs are forced to pull out because of the coronavirus pandemic, although no cases of Covid-19 have been reported in the camps.</p> \n<p>Many refugees \u2013 mostly from Afghanistan, Eritrea, Iran, Iraq and Sudan \u2013 often make repeated attempts to cross to the UK. Last year, 1,900 reached the UK by boat, with many others arriving by lorry. Eighty migrants are understood to have reached the UK by boat last week, with some reports of around 160 attempts in one day.</p> \n<p>While numbers are disputed, internal documents collated by NGOs in the area and seen by the Guardian revealed there are about 1,500 people in Calais, including 160 unaccompanied children, the youngest of whom is 11. There are about 600 people in Grand Synthe in Dunkirk, including around 35 families. Some have serious health problems such as diabetes, and others have suffered broken limbs including a broken arm and a broken jaw.</p> \n<p>A 16-year-old boy from Sudan told the Guardian that he planned to run away and cross the Channel rather than go into one of the French centres. \u201cIf we are taken away to these centres we won\u2019t know what will happen to us,\u201d he said. \u201cI will run away and I will keep trying to reach the UK by lorry. In the camps we are more spread out but if we go into the centres we could be closer together so more at risk.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7a6078f6-5a66-4d3e-9339-5610fe320767\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.</p>\n    <p>The UN agency&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public\">advises</a>&nbsp;people to:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Frequently wash their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or warm water and soap</li>\n     <li>Cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when sneezing or coughing</li>\n     <li>Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever or cough</li>\n     <li>Seek early medical help if they have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and share their travel history with healthcare providers</li>\n     <li>Advice about face masks varies.

Refugees have reported food and water shortages. French authorities are distributing bottled water but it is understood they are concerned that too many water points in the camps will hinder physical distancing. Provision of showers and phone charging facilities have also decreased.</p> \n<p>NGOs working in the camps in Calais say it is crucial that the lockdown is managed properly and that the French authorities work with them, as they are trusted by the refugees.</p> \n<p>Clare Moseley, founder of <a href=\"https://care4calais.org/news/urgent-appeal-food-please-share/\">Care4Calais,</a> which provides emergency aid and support for refugees in Calais and Dunkirk as well as in Brussels, and is continuing to operate in the refugee areas, said: \u201cWe haven\u2019t had any confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the camps. The refugees are more focused on survival than on the virus. We don\u2019t know how \u2018voluntary\u2019 the accommodation centres will be.</p> \n<p>\u201cFood supplies in the camps have reduced significantly and if it\u2019s the only way people can get food, they may feel forced to go. The reduction of food in the camps has been a game-changer. If the only way people can eat is by going into one of the centres then it won\u2019t really be voluntary.\u201d</p> \n<p>She said that after getting legal advice from lawyers in the UK and France, Care4Calais volunteers are continuing to operate as frontline aid workers and are following current World Health Organization guidance on infection control.</p> \n<p>According to documents seen by the Guardian, some unaccompanied minors have reported being beaten by French police and they have told charity workers they prefer to sleep in the camps rather than in centres provided by the French authorities.</p> \n<p>When buses are sent to the camps from Tuesday, migrants who agree to leave will be given a medical check before being transferred. Once they reach the temporary accommodation they will be expected to keep the same lockdown rules as the rest of France, which has prohibited all movement except for essential work, essential shopping, medical appointments and a daily maximum one-hour exercise routine not more than 1km from home.</p> \n<p>Even before the coronavirus crisis, life in the refugee camps was grim. Volunteers said that asking migrants who were often four or five to a tent to maintain social distancing was impossible.</p> \n<p>L\u00e9ah Njeim, a volunteer with Utopia 56, an organisation that distributes food to the camps, told <a href=\"https://www.ouest-france.fr/sante/virus/coronavirus/comment-se-confiner-quand-est-migrant-calais-6791752\">Ouest France</a>: \u201cSome migrants are more than an hour\u2019s walk away from running water.\u201d</p> \n<p>Utopia 56 had been transporting sick migrants to local health centres. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to stop this ... the police are blocking the exit to the Jungle [camp],\u201d Njeim added.</p> \n<p>Secours Catholique, a charity that ran a day centre for 250 to 300 migrants where they could warm up, have a hot drink and charge their mobiles, said it had been forced to close as most of its volunteers were aged over 70 and in the coronavirus \u201cat risk\u201d group. In an open letter to the authorities, 18 NGOs called for the migrants who wished to stay in the Channel area to be housed in \u201chotels, schools and empty apartments\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cTo stay home, you have to have a home to stay in,\u201d the organisations wrote in the <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/mais-pour-rester-chez-soi-il-faut-un-chez-soi\">petition</a> addressed to the French prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe.</p> \n<p>Fran\u00e7ois Guennoc, vice-president of the Auberge des Migrants, told La Voix du Nord newspaper: \u201cGiving them accommodation far away will not work. Some will not get in the buses and there will be people who return soon afterwards.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sources close to the French government told the Guardian that health protection and sheltering arrangements for refugees in the camps were under way.</p>",

the threat of pandemics, was not properly implemented, according to a former government chief scientific adviser.</p> \n  <p>Prof Sir Ian Boyd, who advised the environment department for seven years until last August and was involved in writing the strategy, told the Guardian that a lack of resources was to blame. Other experts said there was a gap between pandemic planning and action, and that the strategy had stalled.</p> \n  <p>The UK has been rated as one of the most prepared nations in the world, and some experts have said the coronavirus outbreak would have overwhelmed any government. However, a 2019 parliamentary inquiry into biological security was postponed and then cancelled because MPs were focused on Brexit and then the December general election.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/29/uk-strategy-to-address-pandemic-threat-not-properly-implemented\">UK strategy to address pandemic threat \u2018not properly implemented\u2019</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8097718f08af215f6fd7a6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/matthewweaver\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-29T12:48:40.852Z\">1.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9a20955ed445c0ea6a2db86a1e82926b623a3dd\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9a20955ed445c0ea6a2db86a1e82926b623a3dd/0_224_6705_4023/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Library photograph of Giant\u2019s Causeway in County Antrim, which is listed as a world heritage site.

  "<p>In functioning democracies, any request by a leader for \u201cemergency powers\u201d is rightly subjected to scrutiny. If granted, a suspension of normal constitutional practice will generally come with a strict time limit attached. Boris Johnson\u2019s coronavirus bill, which gives sweeping new powers to ministers, was <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/emergency-powers-to-tackle-coronavirus-spread-become-law-after-bill-rushed-through-parliament\" title=\"\">passed last week</a> with the proviso that MPs would vote every six months on whether it should be renewed. In France, President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s more <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2020/03/emmanuel-macron-covid-19-crisis-coronavirus\" title=\"\">wide-ranging and draconian</a> emergency measures have a lifespan of two months.</p> <p>It should come as little surprise that the situation is different in Hungary. With characteristic ruthlessness, the prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has taken the political maxim \u201cnever let a crisis go to waste\u201d and run with it. In recent years, he has consolidated his power in office by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/16/hungary-faces-eu-disciplinary-action-over-alleged-rule-of-law-violations\" title=\"\">curbing the independence</a> of Hungary\u2019s courts and media, and restricting the activities of NGOs. This week he will almost certainly acquire dictatorial powers. The Hungarian parliament, dominated by his Fidesz party, is expected to rubber-stamp the \u201cprotecting against the coronavirus\u201d law, ushering in an indefinite period of what amounts to one-man rule in an EU member state.</p> <p>The new law allows Mr Orb\u00e1n to rule by decree, alone and unchallenged. The prime minister will be able to override all existing legislation. Elections will not take place. Information on government actions will be provided to the speaker of the Hungarian parliament and the leaders of parliamentary groups.</p> <p>The spreading of \u201cfalse\u201d information that could lead to social unrest and prevent the \u201cprotection of the public\u201d will become a crime punishable by a lengthy prison sentence. Some of Mr Orb\u00e1n\u2019s cheerleaders in the media <a href=\"https://insighthungary.444.hu/2020/03/20/with-knowledge-of-our-responsibility\" title=\"\">have already suggested approvingly</a> that this provision could lead to the arrest of critical journalists.</p> <p>There are well-grounded fears that these powers will be used to further exert and extend the government\u2019s grip on the institutions of Hungarian civil society, and cast critics of government policy as unpatriotic at a time of national crisis. The decision as to when the current emergency is over will be in the hands of Mr Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz MPs. A compliant parliament may eventually choose to make permanent some of the arrangements introduced in the context of a global health crisis. \u201cEmergency\u201d measures introduced in 2016 to restrict the rights of asylum seekers are still in place.</p> <p>Dealing with the coronavirus pandemic requires harsh measures which curtail individual freedoms. Mr Orb\u00e1n is not the only autocratic leader to have spotted the chance for a power grab. Azerbaijan\u2019s strongman, Ilham Aliyev, has <a href=\"https://atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/azerbaijans-strongman-senses-opportunity-in-coronavirus-pandemic/\" title=\"\">stepped</a> up the harassment of opposition groups. Israel\u2019s beleaguered PM, Benjamin Netanyahu, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-03-18/israel-coronavirus-netanyahu\" title=\"\">used an emergency decree</a> to delay the start of his trial on corruption charges, marginalised parliament and moved to enact unprecedented surveillance measures. It now seems possible that a national unity government will be formed with Mr Netanyahu\u2019s main political rival, Benny Gantz, the leader of the Blue and White party. Ominously, in the United States, Donald Trump has begun to consider himself a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/24/wartime-coronavirus-powers-state-of-emergency\" title=\"\">\u201cwartime president\u201d</a>.</p> <p>MEPs <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20200324IPR75702/ep-stands-up-for-democracy-in-hungary-during-covid-19\" title=\"\">have called on</a> the European commission to launch an inquiry into Mr Orb\u00e1n\u2019s new law. But it will be in place long before that begins. This will be another bad week for Hungarian democracy.</p>",

It was also seven years before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/09/spanish-flu-pandemic-centenary-first-world-war\">Spanish flu</a> pandemic, which infected 500 million worldwide, and killed her sister.</p> <p>The coronavirus pandemic had prompted Churchill to reminisce about the Spanish flu, according to her grandson, Anthony Churchill. He said: \u201cWhen I visited her last, we talked about coronavirus and mentioned we might not see her for a while. She said it was very similar to the Spanish flu but in her day there were no planes and somehow it still managed to spread everywhere.\u201d</p> <p>She and most of her family in their home in Crewe became infected with the Spanish flu, including her father, who collapsed in the street, she recalled. They all survived apart from her 12-month-old baby sister, Beryl May. \u201cShe remembered standing at her bedroom window and seeing this little coffin carrying her baby sister being put into a carriage and being taken away,\u201d her grandson said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"406bae68e3627cbf621c6b3775281f0f8b955895\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/406bae68e3627cbf621c6b3775281f0f8b955895/0_243_1062_637/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hilda Churchill with her husband in 1929.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hilda Churchill with her husband in 1929.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Churchill/SWNS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He said: \u201cShe remembers everyone getting it and her mother trying to look after them and her father collapsing in a street and having to be carried home. She was saying how amazing it is that something you can\u2019t see can be so devastating.</p> <p>\u201cIt was never something she talked about being frightened of, though, and she was scared of this new virus. She survived so much and this was just another thing. She was a person who just got on with things \u2013 never asked for sympathy or said she was hard done by.\u201d</p> <p>He said his grandmother, a seamstress who moved to Salford during the Great Depression to find work, had generally been in good health until recently and moved into the care home 10 months ago. \u201cShe had a fall and her legs just packed up. She never understood how she got so old. I think it was the hard work that kept her going. That and good genes. She had been with me all of my life - she was just the best and we are totally heartbroken.\u201d</p> <p>She had four children, 11 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren and three great-great-grandchildren.</p> <p>Other recent coronavirus victims to be named include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/first-working-nhs-surgeon-dies-from-coronavirus\">Adil El Tayar</a>, 63, the first working NHS surgeon to die from the disease.

  "<p>The world\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-has-26k-living-per-1sqkm-says-bmc-report/story-83y9dyIsVpnQxjQAH9Y1nO.html\">second-most crowded city</a> is trying to stay home, but it wasn\u2019t built for social distancing. Ever since it became an entrep\u00f4t of the British empire, Mumbai has been optimised to keep things moving \u2013 both labour and capital. Over the last fortnight, its citizens have been retreating from public premises. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/nov/28/slum-loaded-term-homegrown-neighbourhoods-mumbai-dharavi\">majority</a> are now confined to one- or two-room tenement housing, often with dividing walls made of tin and tarpaulin. These stand cheek-by-jowl with shops, restaurants and crowded medical clinics. Isolation is for people who live in homes with attached toilets.</p> <p>The numbers aren\u2019t yet staggering. Unlike New York City, which currently accounts for nearly 10% of the world\u2019s known Covid-19 cases, <a href=\"https://howindialives.com/gram/coronadistricts/\">Mumbai counts 74</a> as of this writing. Unlike London, authorities here initiated shutdowns before India\u2019s government passed orders for a national lockdown.</p> <p>The novel coronavirus was first detected here, as elsewhere, among wealthy international travellers, but last week it made its <a href=\"https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/mumbai/cover-story/wily-virus-moves-into-slum-chawls/articleshow/74819907.cms\">first appearance</a> in Mumbai\u2019s informal settlements, where unchecked spread would be devastating. Under these circumstances, the extreme measure of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/indias-13bn-population-locked-down-to-beat-coronavirus\">quarantining 1.3 billion people</a> may have looked like a sensible decision to stave off tragedy. Yet on the first morning after lockdown, it was immediately clear that another tragedy was already under way.</p> <p>Television news programmes showed long lines of migrant labourers leaving big cities, starting the long walk, on empty stomachs and in blistering heat, to their homes in rural India. With industry and construction at a standstill, daily wagers found themselves out of jobs, instantly unable to afford food or shelter. Without buses and trains, they were out of transport. From Mumbai, 300 workers were found <a href=\"https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/coronavirus-india-lockdown-300-rajasthan-workers-found-travelling-in-truck-containers-from-telangana-2201303\">stowing away</a> in stifling container trucks. From Delhi, weary migrants trickling back into the neighbouring province of Uttar Pradesh on foot <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/coronavirus-india-lockdown-supply-chain-problem-6331743/\">recalled scenes of famine</a> in British India.</p> <p>How have we been plunged, unprepared, into wartime? Independent India\u2019s welfare state evolved precisely in response to its depredations under empire: its core job has always been to feed the hungry. We have a powerful central government led by the country\u2019s most popular politician, Narendra Modi. Since February, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RahulGandhi/status/1227536939479228417\">opposition politicians</a> have been warning of the approaching risks. The southern state of Kerala, the first to start widespread testing and quarantine measures, has prevented uncontrolled outbreak within its borders for several weeks.</p> <p>So, at least in principle, this country should not have gone from bracing for an epidemic to expecting twin catastrophes of contagion and starvation. But we have. As every country in the world faces up to the mistakes it has made in confronting this disease, it\u2019s hard not to feel that India is emblematic of how unprepared the world was for Covid-19. What else was going to happen in a country that has more billionaires than anywhere save China and the US, but still has the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis_in_India\">world\u2019s highest incidence of tuberculosis</a>? </p> <p>Indian epidemiologists already <a href=\"https://scroll.in/article/956932/interview-suppression-wont-work-in-india-slow-down-the-coronavirus-this-will-be-a-long-haul\">knew</a> that total lockdown wouldn\u2019t work in India the way it does in Europe: the infrastructure to ensure basic necessities at every doorstep doesn\u2019t exist, which is why many essential services, from grocery delivery to agricultural work, are exempt from curfews.</p> <p>The infectious diseases expert <a href=\"https://www.bloombergquint.com/coronavirus-outbreak/coronavirus-outbreak-its-a-long-road-to-normal-says-leading-epidemiologist-j-muliyil\">Dr Jayaprakash Muliyil</a> advised us to devise various forms of community participation in controlling the disease instead: discouraging large gatherings and preparing to practice social distancing for months at a time. India\u2019s only option was to \u201cmitigate\u201d, he told the digital publication Scroll \u2013 not \u201cmilitate\u201d.</p> <p>This was oblique, but prescient. Indians are now spectators as police are filmed committing brutality on the streets, beating, humiliating, even <a href=\"https://scroll.in/latest/957298/covid-19-lockdown-man-out-to-buy-milk-in-west-bengal-beaten-up-by-police-dies-claims-family\">allegedly murdering people</a> who step out to hunt for essentials. There is a resonant continuity with scenes from India\u2019s winter of political dissent, during which Modi\u2019s government excused or enabled nauseating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/03/we-are-not-safe-indias-muslims-tell-of-wave-of-police-brutality\">police violenc</a>e to suppress street protests.</p> <p>This footage is available, for now, because the government has designated media work an \u201cessential service\u201d that must function through the emergency. Meanwhile, misinformation and <a href=\"https://news.abplive.com/videos/news/india-up-cm-yogi-adityanath-welcomes-package-under-pm-garib-kalyan-yojana-1183059\">propaganda</a> bolt through televisions and WhatsApp, spreading superstition, medical hoaxes and racist rumours about minorities, none of which Modi has addressed, in spite of three long prime-time discourses on Covid-19 delivered to the nation.</p> <p>Last week, even before the grievous spectacle of internal displacement began, Modi told Indians that we face a challenge greater than that of the world wars. It was a significant claim to make to a country that sent millions of soldiers to those battlefields, and suffered the effects deeply. But it also suggested that the prime minister knows the situation is far worse than his government is letting on: the epidemiologist Dr Ramanan Laxminarayan pointed out <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrrsXCxs2xg&amp;feature=youtu.be\">in an interview</a> that if Modi believed India\u2019s modest official numbers and projections, he would not have used such a grave analogy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/29/coronavirus-means-we-really-are-finally-all-in-this-together\">Coronavirus means we really are, finally, all in this together  | John Harris</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What lies in store for India?

But our nation of 1.3 billion is still only testing 18 people per million: some say <a href=\"https://scroll.in/pulse/957380/testing-is-key-to-fighting-coronavirus-so-why-does-india-have-such-a-low-testing-rate\">because of red tape</a>, others that India is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SreenivasanJain/status/1239806166995046406\">hiding the extent of the problem</a>.</p> <p>In Mumbai, where people otherwise take a certain big-city pride in toughing it out through crises, the Covid-19 lockdown has taken away our most visible source of support: each other.

But these numbers are a fraction of the population that has lost the certainty of its next meal, the prospect of its next job and, for perhaps the first time in a generation, the optimism that tomorrow will be better.

  "<h2>John Lennon <em>by Julian Lennon</em></h2> <p>A lot of the happy memories of my father are from the late 1960s at Kenwood, the old Tudor house we had in Surrey, when I was a little boy. Without knowing it, I probably saw some of the greatest musicians in the world come and go through that house.</p> <p>I remember sitting on the roof of that house with my dad making a balsawood aeroplane. There was a great view from up there. As a kid, I thought my dad was pretty happy \u2013 with the family, the family home and his place in the world. Who could have predicted that everything was about to change?</p> <p>The Beatles had just released <em>Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band</em>. At the time, my dad had his famous psychedelic Rolls-Royce Phantom V, which I adored because it had a record player in the back. We also had a Honda Monkey bike, a mini motorcycle we used to ride around on. Ringo [Starr] lived down the road and my dad would take me to see him on the bike. </p> <p>At Kenwood, my father and I were close. So close, in fact, that though my first name is also John, I started to get called Julian or Jules since when my mum would shout, \u201cJohn, your dinner\u2019s ready!\u201d both my dad and I would react.</p> <p>Then suddenly my dad literally disappeared off the face of the planet. At least, that\u2019s how it seemed to me. He and Yoko Ono were deeply and publicly in love. And I felt as if my mum and I had been cast aside. Not everyone forgot about us, though. Paul wrote Hey Jules after dropping in to check how my mum and I were doing. (Obviously, the title of the song changed to Hey Jude).</p> <p>Maybe 10 years passed during which my dad and I barely spoke. I was very angry about how he left the family. It was thanks to my mum that we started having conversations again. She was such a gentle soul, never vindictive in any way, shape or form. She always wanted me to have a relationship with him.</p> <p>I was scared the first time I went to visit him in the US after my parents\u2019 divorce. I was becoming more aware of the magnitude of this man. Much to my relief, the visit was a success. My dad was charming and funny and warm. From that trip on, I remember us getting along better. </p> <p>I hesitated to enter the music business because of who Dad was. I would send him the odd cassette of me playing live, or song ideas I had recorded on a little Sony Walkman he had given me.</p> <p>He warmly encouraged me to continue playing, but sadly, he never really got to see my career unfold, as he passed when I was just 17. When I did finally become a professional musician a few years later, I felt like I understood him better.</p> <p>I try to remember my dad as fondly as possible. I strive for forgiveness and understanding in that area of my life, for the difficult times he put my mum and me through. I loved her more than anything and can\u2019t forget how poorly he treated her. But our relationship was getting better before he died. He was in a happier place. He wanted to reconnect, not just with me but with the rest of his family. He never got a chance to do so. Even now, almost 40 years after he died, I hold my father\u2019s memory dear.</p> <p><em>Julian Lennon is a musician and photographer and the founder of the <a href=\"https://whitefeatherfoundation.com/\" title=\"\">White Feather Foundation</a></em></p> <h2>Caitlyn Jenner <em>by Brandon Jenner</em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee89c32158f97ee16af9a0beb5fef852ab19d03d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee89c32158f97ee16af9a0beb5fef852ab19d03d/0_120_3850_2310/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bruce Jenner with baby son Brandon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Now, we\u2019re making up for lost time\u2019: Bruce Jenner (as she then was) with baby Brandon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My father spent the first 65 years of her life trying to avoid answering the question \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d And because of that, she didn\u2019t ask it often, either. And, though, I understand that she avoided the question because the answer would have laid bare too many struggles, it made my relationship with her challenging. People connect with each other through vulnerability, and you can only get someone to open up to you if you are willing to be vulnerable yourself. Because she was shielding something so important from herself, Dad remained distant for much of my life.</p> <p>I don\u2019t have many memories from before my parents split up and my father moved out. I was four at the time. They got divorced because my dad had decided to start transitioning to female. I, of course, was too young then to have any idea what was behind their decision.</p> <p>I do, however, remember a few details from my early childhood that only made sense much later. For instance, when I was very young, I used to love to fiddle with people\u2019s ears. Once when I reached out to touch my dad\u2019s ears, he said: \u201cDon\u2019t do that. I just had surgery.\u201d He pointed to a thin line of small black stitches behind his ear, grinned, and said: \u201cThey took my ear off, peeled my face back, and then stitched it back on.\u201d </p> <p>For the first few years after their divorce, my parents were amicable. Mom started dating David Foster, whom she later married. I never called him dad, but he was the one who lived with us, who told me to pick up my clothes and turn off the lights \u2013 all the typical dad things. So even though this is about Caitlyn, I could write just as easily about David. He was a wonderful father figure.</p> <p>A few years after my parents divorced, Dad apparently decided that it wasn\u2019t the right time to transition and had many of his surgeries reversed. After that, his relationship with my mother grew more hostile. She had worked hard to accept that the reason he couldn\u2019t be with her was because he was working towards transitioning. When he started dating Kris Jenner, whom he would go on to marry, that line of reasoning fell apart. It was tremendously painful. The effect of my parents\u2019 souring relationship was that I didn\u2019t see my father more than half a dozen times between ages eight and 25.</p> <p>Because of this, most of the memories I have of my dad are from the narrow slice of time before I was eight. I remember him betting my brother Brody and me $20 that he could beat us to the top of these insanely high giant sand dunes in Malibu and then just smoking us. He ran a flat-out decathlete sprint. He didn\u2019t even pretend to let us win.</p> <p>After Dad met and married Kris, family became a business for him, and I stayed away for most of my teenage years. I didn\u2019t want to be a part of their dynamic. When I was in my 20s and his daughters with Kris \u2013 Kendall and Kylie \u2013 were teenagers, Dad and I began to re-establish a relationship. He wasn\u2019t as needed around the house and, I think, was looking for someone to talk to. Although, to be honest, instead of talking, we did things. We worked on my car or flew radio-controlled planes in the park near his house. But even then, it always seemed Dad had his guard up.</p> <p>Once he decided to go through with the transition, I was the first of her children she confided in. As soon as Dad said it herself, I was so happy for her.</p> <p>As her son, I wish my dad had been able to transition sooner, not only because I think she would have been happier, but because I think we could have built a stronger relationship earlier. Now, I\u2019m making up for lost time. I speak to my dad almost every day, and every time, she asks me, \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d</p> <p><em>Brandon Jenner is a singer and songwriter</em> </p> <h2>Jeff Bridges <em>by Isabelle Bridges Boesch</em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ef5380327e347eac14124fcdfb48626518b7c4e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ef5380327e347eac14124fcdfb48626518b7c4e/0_0_3157_1894/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bridges poses for a portrait after being nominated in the Best Actor category for the 82nd Academy Awards for his role in \u201cCrazy Heart\u201d in Los Angeles\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It was like having the most imaginative friend in the world\u2019: Isabelle Bridges Boesch on her dad Jeff Bridges.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mario Anzuoni/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My dad came from a family of actors. His father, Lloyd, was an actor. His mother, Dorothy, was an actor. His brother Beau is an actor, too. He knows firsthand how weird and challenging it could be to have an actor as a parent, which means he is very good at being a famous actor father.</p> <p>When I was growing up, my dad was really hitting his stride. He made many of his greatest films, from <em>The Fabulous Baker Boys</em> to <em>The Fisher King</em> to <em>Fearless</em>, before I was 10 years old. He was often away shooting for weeks at a time, leaving my mother to look after me and my two sisters. She likes to say she takes care of the empire \u2013 and she does.</p> <p>But when my dad was at home, it was like having the greatest, most imaginative friend in the world. What makes him such a wonderful actor is the same thing that makes him a wonderful playmate: he\u2019s a great pretender. He relished opening up his rich inner life to share with me and my sisters, and he was always happy to be part of ours, too. My sisters and I loved to dress him up, put flowers in his hair \u2013 he\u2019s always had a nice head of hair \u2013 and decorate his face with makeup. When Dad was around, we\u2019d draw or paint or just play pretend for hours. He has such a playful spirit. The only time he ever brought his work home with him was the day he returned from shooting Blown Away still in makeup, his face appearing all bloodied and bruised. I think he wanted to scare us, but we just loved peeling off the stretchy plastic fake blood from his face. It was really satisfying.</p> <p>But, of course, he couldn\u2019t always be at home. When he was away, Dad made sure we stayed connected. He\u2019d call every night. He\u2019d say something like, \u201cIsabelle, when you\u2019re asleep tonight, you\u2019ll see a building. Go through the front door and climb up to the attic. What do you see?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI see the branch of an oak tree by the window,\u201d I\u2019d reply. Then he\u2019d ask, \u201cDo you see the tree house nestled in the crook of the branch?\u201d I\u2019d laugh and say I did. \u201cLet\u2019s meet there tonight,\u201d he\u2019d say. \u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll jump on our horses and ride to the mountains.\u201d \u201cSounds like a plan,\u201d he\u2019d say. In the morning, he\u2019d call again, and we\u2019d go over the adventures we\u2019d had in our dreams the night before.</p> <p>I always knew my father was loving and sweet and playful, but it\u2019s still funny to me that he\u2019s become so closely identified with the Dude. By the time <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/20/the-big-lebowski-review-the-dude-jeff-bridges-coen-brothers\">The Big Lebowski</a></em> came out, I was in high school, and, just like a typical teenager, I had zero interest in my father\u2019s work. (I still haven\u2019t seen some of his films from that period.) What I remember most is that around that time, we were on vacation in Hawaii, and my dad was wearing those hideous Sun Jellies from the movie. They\u2019re one of the most well-known parts of his costume, but they were actually my dad\u2019s own shoes. Anyway, my sister and I were so embarrassed by those godawful jellies, we threw them into the ocean. Today, they\u2019d probably be worth a lot of money.</p> <p>Another funny thing about people conflating Dad with the Dude is that he\u2019s not really a laid-back guy. He gets anxious. He experiences stress. Before he goes onstage, he always says he doesn\u2019t want to do it, and afterward, he is critical of himself. Though he describes himself as \u201cBuddhish\u201d, he doesn\u2019t project Zen calm. He is, however, extremely present. Even more so now that he\u2019s older and a grandfather. I have two kids of my own, and he is very focused on being in their lives. We live in Oakland, but he and my mom visit often. And when he\u2019s not able to be with his grandkids, he calls to plan dream meetings with them, too.</p> <p><em>Daddy Daughter Day by Isabelle Bridges Boesch and Jeff Bridges (Penguin Random House) is due to be published in October</em></p> <h2>Samuel L Jackson <em>by Zoe Jackson</em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c54b7c4d4bc823f3091e7cca1dea64cbd5158fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c54b7c4d4bc823f3091e7cca1dea64cbd5158fe/0_0_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Samuel L.

He is completely different from his cool-guy persona. When I was 10 we would go to the comic store every week religiously. They even kept a pull box for my dad (the store pulls the new comics on a customer\u2019s list and keeps them behind the counter). Dad\u2019s pull box was full of weird and really violent comics that I wasn\u2019t allowed to read. He and I didn\u2019t start exchanging comic books until I got to college, and when I was there, whenever I went to the comic book store alone, I was sad. I wanted my dad to be there.</p> <p>Though I was largely shielded from it at as a child, my dad was struggling with addiction during much of my childhood. When I was eight, he entered rehab. He was gone for 60 days, which was a confusing time for me. I had no idea anything was wrong. I never saw him drunk that I know of. I just thought he was a dude who slept a lot.</p> <p>We moved to Los Angeles for my mum, LaTanya Richardson: she got a role in a shortlived TV series. But soon my dad\u2019s career really took off, and my mum stopped working as much to take care of me. It\u2019s funny that my father is the better-known actor, because my mum was the one who pushed him to act in the first place. They met in a teacher\u2019s office (They went to different colleges but the teacher taught at both places.) Mum was doing some makeup work. She said, \u201cYou need to be in my play. Do you act?\u201d Dad said, \u201cActually, I don\u2019t,\u201d and my mum replied, \u201cWell, you do now.\u201d And that\u2019s how it went, and how it has gone ever since. My mum turns the key and sends Dad out into the world.</p> <p>I do think it was very hard for my mum to give up her career to raise me for as long as she did, though. She\u2019s happy for my dad, of course, but it\u2019s complicated. There\u2019s a sadness there.</p> <p>I was 12 years old when <em>Pulp Fiction</em> came out. After that, my dad became cool. Or, he thought he did. And though much of the world agrees, he\u2019s still just a big nerd to me. He goes through phases. Once, he gave me a sweatshirt he got from working on <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/17/django-unchained-review\">Django Unchained</a></em>. He said, \u201cI signed it for you!\u201d I was like, \u201cDad, thanks. Now I can\u2019t wear it!\u201d It\u2019s up to my mum and me to pull him back down to earth. I mean, isn\u2019t that what family\u2019s for?</p> <p><em>Zoe Jackson is an Emmy Award\u2013nominated television producer and director</em> </p> <h2>John Wayne <em>by Ethan Wayne</em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2bc1d240166a8ae04b351685ac3ba0bdad5ab2f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bc1d240166a8ae04b351685ac3ba0bdad5ab2f4/0_726_6552_7120/920.jpg\" alt=\"John Wayne with his young son Ethan.\" width=\"920\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">True grit: John Wayne with his young son Ethan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John R Hamilton/Courtesy of John Wayne Enterprises</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was born in 1962, at the height of my father\u2019s career. He named me after Ethan Edwards, his character in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-searchers\" title=\"\">The Searchers</a></em>, which many consider to be his best role. </p> <p>My father was tough, but very loving. He was old school. I don\u2019t know how else to describe it. He didn\u2019t talk much, but he could make his few words very, very impactful and meaningful. Other actors fight for lines; my dad tried to remove as many words as possible. His friends called him Duke, his childhood nickname. It was the name of his dog, an Airedale. Dad used to deliver papers with Duke. The local firemen called the pair Big Duke and Little Duke. The name stuck. He told me, \u201cNow when someone calls me John, I don\u2019t even turn my head.\u201d</p> <p>In his free time, his life was centred on the ocean. We had a converted Second World War minesweeper called Wild Goose and every summer, we would sail up to British Columbia and Alaska. Every winter, we would take it down to Mexico.</p> <p>When he wasn\u2019t on the boat, Dad was working. So I was raised on movie sets. They were rugged in those days. Our family would stay either in a small rented house or in a little motel. I had a tutor three hours a day, but I learned a lot from my father, too. He never told me \u201cdo this\u201d or \u201cdo that\u201d, but led by example. You never wanted to disappoint him. </p> <p>Once when we were at a friend\u2019s ranch, he asked me to drive to the house in an old pick-up truck and grab some things for him. I was 12. I got the truck stuck and I had to go tell him. He was in the middle of a card game. He didn\u2019t get up or offer to help. It was clear that I was expected to figure out how to get the truck out on my own.</p> <p>Some of my proudest moments came from living up to my father\u2019s straight-ahead toughness. When we were in Cabo or La Paz, Mexico, we\u2019d anchor the boat far from the shore and swim in. It was about a 25-minute swim. I remember once, when I was seven or eight, swimming into a bunch of sea snakes and saying, \u201cHoly crap. There are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/24/snorkelling-grandmothers-uncover-large-population-of-venomous-sea-snakes-in-noumea\" title=\"\">sea snakes</a> here, Dad!\u201d He replied, \u201cYeah, just keep swimming, kid.\u201d</p> <p>Once we made it to shore, we walked around until our clothes dried. He gave me a big hug and said, \u201cGood job, Big Stuff.\u201d I was just so proud to have made it through, proud to be my father\u2019s son.</p> <p>My father died on 11 June 1979. I was 17. At the time, it was just him and me alone in the house; my mother had moved out. That day, he said he wasn\u2019t feeling well, so I drove him to the hospital. As we pulled up, there was a crowd of photographers waiting for him so we had to go through the back. I was worried, but I was also a naive teenager and thought he was going to be OK. He just always got through things. I didn\u2019t know it at the time, but that was the last ride I would ever take with my dad.</p> <p><em>Ethan Wayne is the chairman of the <a href=\"https://johnwayne.org/\" title=\"\">John Wayne Cancer Foundation</a> and president of <a href=\"https://www.johnwayne.com/\" title=\"\">John Wayne Enterprises</a></em></p> <h2>Miles Davis <em>by Erin Davis</em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38a95b407e9c640e9c1fc17622582223e7657971\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38a95b407e9c640e9c1fc17622582223e7657971/0_58_612_367/500.jpg\" alt=\"Miles Davis with son Erin.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Play on: Miles Davis with son Erin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Erin Davis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>People think of my dad as the prince of darkness (the name of his 1967 album), a moody performer who turned his back on the audience out of disregard for them. That wasn\u2019t him at all. But this wasn\u2019t something I truly realised until I stood onstage with him as part of his legendary band: Dad wasn\u2019t turning away from the audience; he was turning toward the band. It wasn\u2019t a sign of disrespect for those there to hear him; it was a sign of respect for those there to play. And I was lucky enough to be there to play.</p> <p>I knew he was a famous musician, but didn\u2019t quite understand how famous. As a kid, I was always telling him I wanted to be a musician. Finally, when I was 14, he asked if I wanted to go on the road with him in the summer. Of course, I said yes.</p> <p>I learned a lot, not only about music, but about my father, during those summer tours. As I stood in the wings, I saw that playing the music live was the most important thing to him. </p> <p>Those tours were the first sustained amount of time I spent with my father. What I discovered about him was how he could break down what was going on in any musical performance \u2013 and find something to take away from it. I remember once watching a heavy metal show on MTV, and when Slayer came on, I thought, \u201cDad\u2019s going to hate this.\u201d He watched for a bit and then said, \u201cHuh. That drummer is really laying it down, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Then he just walked away.</p> <p>He finally asked me onstage for a tour in 1990. He was giving me a chance and I was terrified of blowing it. I played electronic percussion, which was a genre my dad kind of invented. I didn\u2019t even get any rehearsals. I watched the guy who did it before me for a couple of shows, then I was just kind of on it, in the seat. It was nerve-racking for me, but at the same time, it felt wonderful to have my father turn toward me, to listen to me and to play with me as an equal.</p> <p><em>Erin Davis, along with his sister and cousin, is an executor of the Miles Davis estate</em></p> <p><em>To Me, He Was Just Dad by Joshua David Stein is published by Artisan at \u00a317.99.

In the midst of a pandemic, health and legal experts say that policies designed to exclude vulnerable immigrant communities from medical care are fueling a public health disaster.</p> <p>\u201cThe community doesn\u2019t trust the government right now.\u201d said Luz Gallegos, who directs the Todec Legal Center in southern California. As Covid-19 spreads across the state, much of the center\u2019s efforts recently have been dedicated to reassuring immigrants that they can and should take advantage of health programs if they can.</p> <p>Patricia, who went to Todec for advice, said even though she\u2019s been told that the public charge rule doesn\u2019t apply to those who want to get tested for the coronavirus, she can\u2019t help but worry. \u201cWith this president, you can never know,\u201d she said. When immigration policies can change overnight, she said, \u201chow can we have trust?\u201d</p> <p>Even before the public charge rules went into effect, a UCLA analysis found that more than 2 million Californians enrolled in the state\u2019s public food and medical benefits programs could be affected by the rule, which allows immigration officials to turn away those seeking green cards and visas based on who are \u201clikely to be a public charge\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t stop the spread of disease while denying health coverage to people,\u201d said Ninez Ponce, director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research. \u201cIt\u2019s irresponsible public health policy.\u201d</p> <p>Although several groups of immigrants, including asylum-seekers and refugees, are exempt from the rule, the complicated, 217-page regulation has a \u201cchilling effect\u201d, Ponce said, driving people to withdraw from social services even if they don\u2019t have to.</p> <p>On Sunday, local health officials announced a sixth death due to the virus in Riverside county, where Todec is based. \u201cIt feels like people are between walls,\u201d Gallegos said. \u201cThey\u2019re afraid of the outbreak, and they\u2019re afraid of getting help. There\u2019s a lot of trauma in the community.\u201d</p> <p>For Benyamin Chao, who grappled with the public charge regulations before recently gaining a green card, his new legal status hasn\u2019t given him much relief. His mother and younger brother are still undocumented.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re experiencing the pandemic like everyone else, but the thing is, there\u2019s all these additional barriers to where we can get help,\u201d said Chao, 24, who works as a campaign coordinator at the California Immigrant Policy Center. He\u2019s been helping friends and family \u2013 some of whom have been unable to work in bars and restaurants, or as domestic workers or caregivers \u2013 navigate the complex public benefit rules, reminding them that community health clinics and state health programs that aren\u2019t funded by the federal government are safe to use.</p> <p>The economic fallout from the pandemic could leave many immigrants in need of public assistance now, more than ever, Chao noted. But he understands why many immigrants are avoiding seeking medical care altogether. \u201cWhen I filed to adjust my status, my spouse and I disenrolled from CalFresh,\u201d said Chao, referring to a program that provides food assistance for low-income Californians.</p> <p>Even though it was his partner, not him, who had signed up for the program, and even though he knew that taking advantage of that assistance wouldn\u2019t necessarily disqualify his application for a work permit, \u201cI just went with what gave me peace of mind,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd at that point I had probably internalized what I\u2019d heard from the president, about what kind of immigrant I\u2019d be if I was burdening the government.\u201d</p> <p>Mariana Garcia said she and her family were similarly shaken by the administration\u2019s recent policies. The 25-year-old, who is authorized to live and work in the US through the Obama-era Daca program, has health insurance \u2013 for now. But she worries about her father, who still suffers from health complications after being stabbed in the stomach years ago, who has refused to see the doctor recently. \u201cHe\u2019s so afraid of seeking medical care for the virus, or for anything else,\u201d she said, tearing up. \u201cI\u2019m afraid my parents will fall sick.\u201d</p> <p>In an open <a href=\"https://law.yale.edu/sites/default/files/area/center/ghjp/documents/final_covid-19_letter_from_public_health_and_legal_experts.pdf\">letter</a> to Mike Pence and other leaders, nearly 800 public health and legal experts urged officials to make healthcare facilities immigration enforcement-free zones. In a separate letter, 17 attorneys general \u2013 including from California, New York and Washington state \u2014 implored the Trump administration to fully suspend the public charge rule, so people feel comfortable seeking medicare for any and all health issues during the crisis.</p> <p>\u201cHealthcare is not just about addressing an emergency situation,\u201d said Ponce of UCLA. Immigrants who aren\u2019t able to get treatment for underlying health issues before they become serious are not only more likely to die from Covid-19, they\u2019re also more likely to end up in already overwhelmed emergency rooms and intensive care departments. \u201cWe want to do everything we can to help people stave off and fight infections,\u201d Ponce said. \u201cAnd that includes preventative healthcare.\u201d</p> <p>In California, where a quarter of the population is foreign-born, and more than half its citizens has an immigrant parent, leaving even a small segment of immigrant families unable or afraid to seek medical care could undermine statewide efforts to contain coronavirus, Ponce added.</p> <p>The coronavirus pandemic is \u201cExhibit A for why the public charge rule is stupid\u201d said Almas Sayeed, at the California Immigrant Policy Center. Because many of the immigrants eligible for safety-net public health programs work low-wage jobs, the coronavirus crisis has left them needing food assistance and medical benefits now more than ever.</p> <p>\u201cIn many of these hourly jobs, there\u2019s no paid sick time off, there\u2019s no paid family leave,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely insane to keep them from using benefits.\u201d</p> <p>Now more than ever, the policy feels insulting, said Garcia, a farmworker. \u201cWe are the people that provide produce for your home,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are doing some of the hardest jobs in the world.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t consider ourselves a public burden,\u201d added Patricia. \u201cWe are human beings.\u201d</p>",

And by allowing the ability to consult a number of patients in the comfort of their own room, in their own home, in their own isolation, will allow a significant reduction in the amount of PPE required by doctors, nurses and all other frontline healthcare workers that will be taking part in telehealth.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-29T05:48:56.052Z\">at 6.48am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8031188f0878a2a48ac4d8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-29T05:26:26.124Z\">6.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In the past 24 hours Victorian police say they have conducted 1,430 checks that people are complying with quarantine rules.</p> \n  <p>That included 139 checks on returned travellers.

Next Saturday, New Zealand nationals will also be offered access to this flight.</p> \n  <p>People on the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/2712912542154556/\">Australians stranded in Nepal</a> Facebook page say they fear they will be trapped in the country because they cannot afford a ticket, or reach Kathmandu in time for the flight.</p> \n  <p>Michael Bonner, an Australian aid worker with Three Angels Nepal, a non-government organisation, said between 80 and 100 people turned up at the embassy at 9am Saturday local time hoping to organise a ticket home. He said many more were stranded in the Himalayas and other parts of the country and unable to reach Kathmandu in time because roads were closed.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a couple of hundred people who will make this flight and another couple of hundred stranded as the situation in the country deteriorates,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>He called on the government to delay the flight to give more Australians time to reach the capital.</p> \n  <p>In response to concerns expressed on the Facebook page, the Australian ambassador to Nepal, Pete Budd, said he understood people were frustrated, and the embassy had tried to achieve economies of scale by securing the largest possible aircraft.</p> \n  <p>\u201cMany Australians have been stretched financially having paid for bookings that were subsequently cancelled. The disinclination of insurers to cover cancellations due to Covid-19 or reluctance of airlines to offer refunds in a timely manner is not helping,\u201d Budd wrote.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe reality is that aircraft entering Nepal are not permitted to carry passengers. In all likelihood, once arrived in Sydney, the aircraft will also have to return to Doha empty. This adds to the cost. In the event there are future flights, if there are future flights, they are only likely to be more expensive.</p> \n  <p>\u201cFor those Australians disinclined to pay the airfare, or those who are too financially stretched despite their best efforts to seek support from friends and family in Australia, my only advice at this point would be to find a safe place to settle.

Hospitality and entertainment businesses went dark a fortnight ago and retail slammed down the shutters last week. Hundreds of thousands of people have applied for unemployment benefits in a matter of days.</p> \n  <p>And many of those businesses that haven\u2019t already closed are screaming for government action to shut them down because staying open with no customers is rapidly sending them broke.</p> \n  <p>Soon, the fact that so much consumer spending has been ripped out of the economy will ripple through to other sectors such as the finance industry, which employs a large number of people, causing yet more job losses.</p> \n  <p>People who have been stood down do not have money to pay the rent or bills.<br>Businesses that have closed their doors do not have money to pay their landlords.<br>A wage subsidy could help solve the first problem.<br><br>After ruling out the idea, Cormann has now shifted ground somewhat. But what he actually promised was not a direct subsidy but \u201csignificantly enhanced income support through business\u201d.</p> \n  <p>And, pressed by host David Speers on whether this would be dependent on \u201ca requirement to keep staff employed\u201d, the best Cormann could manage was that \u201cthat would be the intention\u201d.</p> \n  <p>From Cormann\u2019s answers, it appears the government is intent on trying to shove more money through the funnel of the business tax system, in the hope that some of it reaches the pockets of workers.</p> \n  <p>This obsession with using the business tax system to push money into the economy was visible from the government\u2019s very first stimulus package, unveiled less than three weeks ago but long since rendered irrelevant by events.</p> \n  <p>It\u2019s a very indirect way of getting money into people\u2019s pockets, and it\u2019s entirely unclear how it can help those who\u2019ve already been laid off. Let\u2019s hope it works.</p> \n  <p>Cormann dodged the question of what to do about preventing people from being evicted because they can\u2019t pay the rent \u2013 a question that has repeatedly been considered by the \u201cnational cabinet\u201d of state and federal leaders without anything being done.</p> \n  <p>On commercial rents, Cormann\u2019s evasions continued when asked whether billionaire retailer Solomon Lew was doing the right thing by refusing to pay his landlords. Unfortunately, Speers didn\u2019t follow up by pointing out that many other retailers and hospitality businesses are doing exactly the same as Lew.</p> \n  <p>And arguing about whether or not businesses should pay their rent is ultimately pointless. If they don\u2019t have the cash \u2013 and many don\u2019t \u2013 they won\u2019t because they can\u2019t.</p> \n  <p>Yes, these are hard problems to solve.

  "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/LamornaAsh?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Lamorna Ash</a> has a hunch about seasickness: a conviction that there could be more than one reason why a person might feel suddenly queasy up on deck. \u201cA fisherman told me that his cousin never used to suffer from seasickness at all,\u201d she says. \u201cBut then he had kids, and suddenly he did. I thought this was fascinating. It made me wonder whether seasickness isn\u2019t somehow connected to things that tie you to the land. Could it be that the more of those things there are, the more likely you are to suffer from it? Perhaps it functions a bit like homesickness in that way.\u201d Struck by her own fancifulness, she flashes me a smile. \u201cWell, anyway\u2026 I like that as a way of thinking about it.\u201d</p> <p>When she was 22 and studying for a master\u2019s degree in social anthropology at University College London, seasickness was briefly Ash\u2019s closest companion. Having decided to devote her thesis to the way that fishing shapes a community, she moved to Newlyn in Cornwall \u2013 which is where she met Don, the skipper of a rusty old trawler called the Filadelfia. Would Don consider taking her out in his boat, so that she might stand, as it were, in \u201cthe same wellies\u201d as his crew? Somewhat to her amazement \u2013 women are supposed to bring bad luck at sea \u2013 he said that he would, and so it was that one evening in 2017 she found herself rounding Land\u2019s End just as the sun was about to set, her stomach a tight knot of nerves, her eyes already red from the salt-licked wind. \u201cI\u2019m someone who doesn\u2019t think too hard about things before I do them,\u201d she says. \u201cI seem not to be very cautious; I get overexcited. But that day, yes, I was nervous. I was very scared of seasickness. Not so much of being sick itself, but of it being so bad that I would be useless and they would have to take me home. I didn\u2019t want to do anything to jeopardise their trip; I knew that would cost them a lot of money.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1be8a8b0e114b9bc24f5606c1fd633a65fe0a2c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1be8a8b0e114b9bc24f5606c1fd633a65fe0a2c1/0_2509_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"don the skipper of the filadelfia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Don, skipper of the Filadelfia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lamorna Ash</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the end, she was sick, but only once. \u201cYou start yawning,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s when you know you\u2019re going to go, and you don\u2019t want the men to see because it\u2019s such a sign of weakness.\u201d Most of the time, however, she was able to manage her constant, raging nausea with a combination of seasickness pills and hard work; among other things, she learned to gut every kind of fish, holding the gasping, flapping creatures tight in her hands even as she struggled properly to stand upright. Life on a trawler is hard, the days long and tough and extremely cold, and thanks to this she found that she was always hungry for the vast meals the crew cooked and ate down below, sickness or no sickness.</p> <p>As for the things that tied <em>her</em> to the land \u2013 her parents, her friends \u2013 she learned not to think of them. It embarrasses her now to remember the moment when, not long after they had set sail, she asked Don for the Filadelfia\u2019s wifi code. (\u201cDo you know how much that costs at sea?\u201d he told her, with a laugh.) Her phone useless in the pocket of her oilskins, she found that time deepened at sea. She learned to speak a new language, one at once both more reticent than the English spoken on land and yet, in some ways, more open, too. In the wheelhouse, talking to Don or one of the other men while they were on watch \u2013 on a trawler, you\u2019re potentially only ever seconds from catastrophe; hit an old anchor or some submarine cables, and the vessel can easily capsize \u2013 she learned to listen to the long, meditative gaps between sentences, spaces that allowed words to \u201cexpand and drift\u201d in ways that rendered them altogether more meaningful.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8230c988221e5362fe8654a67e167d6447659fc2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8230c988221e5362fe8654a67e167d6447659fc2/0_0_4000_6000/667.jpg\" alt=\"lamorna ash on board the newlyn trawler\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Filadelfia freedom: Lamorna Ash on board the Newlyn trawler.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lamorna Ash</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Did the world of the Filadelfia feel very male? Was it unnerving to sleep in her bunk \u2013 its size and shape made her think of a coffin \u2013 alongside all those snoring, hairy, briny men? \u201cI didn\u2019t especially experience it like that, no,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were older than me; they\u2019re family guys, and their women are very strong. The biggest fishing family in Newlyn, the Stevensons, has a matriarch at the head of it. I never felt unsafe, though now and then I would ask one of them: <em>would you say that to a man? </em>But I did want to prove myself a bit. I was never going just to sit there and make notes and take photographs.\u201d Ash studied English at Oxford, and Don made her think of Singleton, the old sailor on Joseph Conrad\u2019s Narcissus: the men who could understand Singleton\u2019s silences were, she recalled, those mariners who \u201cknew how to exist beyond the pale of life\u201d. Staring out into the blue-black, she realised on that first night aboard the Filadelfia that she and its crew had now themselves moved beyond the pale: a confined, almost monastic existence, and yet an unencumbered, roaming one, too \u2013 and so began what she thinks of today as the richest and most vast experience of her life so far.</p> <p>Ash\u2019s eight-day stint on the Filadelfia forms the spine of her first book, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/dark-salt-clear-9781526600011.html\">Dark, Salt, Clear: Life in a Cornish Fishing Town</a></em>; artfully, she returns to it again and again, to the point where you come to believe she must always have known she would one day put the experience between hard covers. But this was, she insists, never her plan. Her thesis complete, she was interning at the <em>Times Literary Supplement</em> when a publisher spotted a piece she had written about a trip she took on another trawler, the Crystal Sea \u2013 that publisher asked to meet her, and duly gave her a book deal (she now works for an educational charity). And in person, it\u2019s impossible not to take her at her word. I\u2019m amazed and slightly shocked when she reveals that she spent, in total, just three and a half months in Newlyn; something about her book \u2013 the intimacy of the encounters it describes; the epic quality of her account of life on the Filadelfia \u2013 leads you to imagine that she must have lived there for a year at least, and possibly much longer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6504536601f017d1f867c4c60f86fdf6a3a5ba6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6504536601f017d1f867c4c60f86fdf6a3a5ba6f/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"catch of the day on the filadelfia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Catch of the day on the Filadelfia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lamorna Ash</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She and I meet in Penzance. She has been in Newlyn all weekend, seeing old friends and mooching around, and when I get off the train on a bright Monday afternoon, she pitches up in a long coat and with a ravishing new pixie haircut looking like someone who is slightly drunk on fresh air. For both of us, London and Covid-19 suddenly seem very far away. We can breathe. St Michael\u2019s Mount casts its usual spell out in the bay (24 hours later, the National Trust will announce that it is now closed to the public). <a href=\"https://jubileepool.co.uk/\">The Jubilee Pool</a>, Penzance\u2019s celebrated art deco saltwater lido, looks strangely inviting even in mid-March. The people, mostly retired, that we pass as we walk along the promenade are unhurried and smiling.</p> <p>Still, it\u2019s important not to take things at face value. Ash has a family connection to this part of Cornwall; she spent her childhood holidays in Lelant, near St Ives, where her mother\u2019s side of the family has lived for generations. But if those times were idyllic \u2013 her mother, a former actor who once appeared in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/poldark\">Poldark</a></em>, was always encouraging her to let her imagination run wild as they walked on the beach \u2013 Cornwall has, of course, a darker side: chiaroscuro shades that she learned to see (\u201canother way of looking\u201d) more clearly during her time in Newlyn.</p> <p>Though the town is one of the most profitable fishing ports in Britain, it is also poor. In 2015, the mean gross annual salary in Penzance, of which Newlyn is a part (the two merge almost seamlessly together nowadays), was \u00a326,788, compared with \u00a334,265 in the rest of the country. Penzance is literally the end of the line, as anyone who has travelled there by train will know, and Newlyn sits at the far side of a county that in 2017 had the 10th highest numbers of homeless people in the country, and the third highest suicide rate in the UK. Cornwall is the only county poor enough to have qualified for EU emergency funding \u2013 a sad fact that did very little to change its implacable determination to vote for Brexit (the <a href=\"https://www.cornwall.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/brexit/\">leave vote in the county</a> was 56.5%).</p> <p>In Newlyn, Ash carefully points out the sights to me. Here is the fish market, where she once spent a morning unpacking catch after catch, her fingers so cold she could not feel them (stored in ice, the lemon sole were the hardest to break apart); here is the Swordfish Inn, AKA the Swordy, where she used to drink with her new fishermen friends (it was once ranked second in a TV documentary entitled <em>The Toughest Pubs in Britain</em>); and here is the little house where she lodged with a couple she came to think of as her guardian angels, Denise and Lofty (Denise worked in a fishmongers; Lofty is a ship chandler). Finally, we go past Newlyn\u2019s lifeboat station and out on to the pontoons in the harbour to look at the boats. The creaking Filadelfia has, she says, finally given up the ghost, but there are two trawlers here that look just like it: rough, industrial vessels with huge derricks from which their nets drag. In her book, she likens these boats to prehistoric birds with skeletal wings, and as we gaze at them, clanking and inhospitable, it isn\u2019t hard to see why.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3cd714045c9f1d5c66c86f123a013e6770242672\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3cd714045c9f1d5c66c86f123a013e6770242672/0_0_6500_4338/1000.jpg\" alt=\"the swordfish inn at newlyn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Swordfish Inn, Newlyn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Hawkins Photography/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Newlyn has the largest number of vessels in its administration of any port in the UK, 88% of which are \u201c10 metres and under\u201d inshore fishing boats \u2013 and the harbour looks busy to me, if not exactly bustling. And yet, as Ash writes in <em>Dark, Salt, Clear</em>, over the years \u201cthe pontoons\u2019 leaves have become sparser \u2013 a deciduous tree living a perpetual winter\u201d. The number of fishing vessels nationally has fallen by 29% since 1996. The money needed to buy and maintain a boat, and the cost of fuel, grows ever higher; combined with expensive struggles over quotas, these things have worked to put off a new generation from following their parents into the industry (though a trawler man can earn a good living, depending on the type of boat he has, and how good the fishing is in his waters). Does she feel Newlyn could survive a future without fishing? She shakes her head. \u201cYou know what they say: for every man at sea, there are three people [connected to the industry] on land. The guys I was with in the pub last night: one was a filleter, one works at the auctions.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The men take a misanthropic pleasure in telling you how awful it is.

A lot don\u2019t. There is a sense of it being a hard life, but there\u2019s also sadness when a boat that has been in a family for generations suddenly isn\u2019t any more. It can be heart-wrenching [for a young person] to say: I can\u2019t live here, I can\u2019t do what my dad did, my education will take me elsewhere.</p> <p>\u201cI met a guy who, when he was 12, used to run off on a boat. \u2018See you in a week, Mum,\u2019 he would say, once it was too late for her to do anything about it. It was a brilliant escape, a rite of passage. The older men were heroes for him, and he wanted to be like them. Fishing comes with many frustrations. The men hate throwing fish off the boat [to stay within EU quotas], and there have been low points when there was very little money in it. It\u2019s very precarious. What if you can\u2019t go out? You\u2019re dependent on the weather, especially if you\u2019re a small boat: a crabber, say. But on the other hand, there are not many industries where you can rise up so high.\u201d Is being a skipper a bit like being a king? Or a God? She laughs. \u201cYes, maybe it is.\u201d</p> <p>Brexit is mentioned only rarely in her book; its politics are deliberately oblique. But the subject came up a lot while she was in Newlyn. The first trawler she went on, the Crystal Sea, was part of the Brexit flotilla that sailed into London in 2016 (organised by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/15/no-deal-brexit-buccaneers-make-waves-on-the-tyne-nigel-farage\">Fishing for Leave</a>, it sailed from Ramsgate to Westminster, demanding that Britain take back control of its waters; under the common fisheries policy, European fleets are given equal access to EU waters and fishing grounds up to 12 nautical miles from the coasts of member states). \u201cIts crew spoke about \u2018our seas\u2019, which always felt bonkers to me. Fish migrate, and when you\u2019re out there\u2026 the sea is vast. It feels as though it belongs to everyone. But we had good debates. They were kind of vital for me. They made me see that arguments about waters are very complicated; I stopped assuming that a certain point of view was right.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d3f002a81b17fbd769f00cc8b558f370327d8eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d3f002a81b17fbd769f00cc8b558f370327d8eb/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"seaview from the deck of the filadelfia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">View from the deck\u2026</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lamorna Ash</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the fishermen aren\u2019t dumb; they\u2019re not, by her telling, particularly hopeful that Brexit, even now it is agreed, will necessarily work to their benefit. After all, the fishing industry makes up only about 0.05% of the UK\u2019s GDP, and employs fewer than 12,000 people. \u201cI think they\u2019re preparing for disappointment,\u201d she says. \u201cThey have the sense that they are always sold down the river. Politicians use them for a cause, and then they drop them. It\u2019s a long way [from London] down here, and you feel that rage a lot: their awareness that the debate is never about their place.\u201d What about the money the EU has long pumped into Cornwall? (It received some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/13/cornwall-council-eu-cornish-embassy-brussels-brexit\">\u00a380m a year in EU funding</a>, money that went into jobs, training and local infrastructure.) Did she ever point this out to them? \u201cYes, but they just ignore certain things. It\u2019s territorial for them.\u201d</p> <p>And what about her? In what ways did her experiences at sea change her? She isn\u2019t, she says, a particularly squeamish person; apart from when she was dealing with rays, a fish that seemed to be somehow more fiercely alive than the sole and the monkfish, and which could only be killed with a stab to the heart, she didn\u2019t mind the gutting and the filleting. She was learning new skills, and there was something so unexpectedly beautiful, she thinks, even about their arrabbiata-sauce coloured insides: \u201cThe brilliant thing is that every time I have fish now, I think about the supply chain. It has made me more appreciative, knowing that men are out there, risking their lives.\u201d Most people are, she thinks, very distant from their shrink-wrapped food: far <em>too</em> distant: \u201cI have the sense, living in London, of so rarely being involved in <em>real</em> things.\u201d</p> <p>Her time in Newlyn also taught her to think, both as a city person and one determined to be more green, in a more nuanced way about the environmental issues around fishing. \u201cPeople say we have got to get rid of the trawlers, because of the damage they do to the seabed. But I know that doing so will affect the lives of a whole community \u2013 though it\u2019s a relief when you hear about the smaller boats: there is a future that could be greener.\u201d British people need to start eating more hake, she thinks: \u201cWe catch so much of it.\u201d (The fishermen of St Ives, incidentally, refer to themselves as Hakes, while the Newlyn men, with whom they are fiercely rivalrous, like to call the north coasters the Scaly Backs.)</p> <p>But she does not want to romanticise. As her book makes plain, fishing takes its effects on mental health; some men come to have issues with alcohol (though it is strictly forbidden at sea), and depression is a problem, too. \u201cI hope that I show the limits of close community, as well as its benefits,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve had my own problems with depression in the past, and it was good to talk to the fishermen about their mental health. I recognised the disassociation they sometimes felt \u2013 it\u2019s how they survive \u2013 and how scary it can sometimes be.\u201d A fisherman\u2019s life is one of extremes: his sense of jeopardy swiftly replaced by one of celebration when he arrives home safely and hits the pub. As one of the men, Nathan, once told her: when a fisherman is at home, he\u2019s always counting the days until he leaves; and when he\u2019s at sea, he\u2019s always counting the days until he\u2019ll be back.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"40b52a42a434efc60157ecd40aed91f5a1cc097e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40b52a42a434efc60157ecd40aed91f5a1cc097e/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"on board the filadelfia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On board the Filadelfia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lamorna Ash</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On her last night on the Filadelfia, Don cooked (how on earth did he do it?) one of the best meals she has ever eaten \u2013 a huge roast dinner of potatoes, mashed swede, Yorkshire puddings, cauliflower cheese, parsnips and beef \u2013 after which the crew, in spite of their bloated bellies, landed the best catch of their trip, the derricks moaning loudly as they pulled up the immense haul of prized turbot and cuttlefish (\u201clike waiting for lottery numbers to come up,\u201d Ash thought, as she waited to see what the nets had brought). But after this, the mood changed. No one slept much on that last night.</p> <p>Fishermen call it \u201cchannelling\u201d: when thoughts of home, and all the people in it, swim through your mind all night, waking you repeatedly. One of the men tells her that the term is drawn from the word \u201cchannel\u201d in its spiritual sense: the conveying of a spirit from another world to this one. (The link between these two worlds is the boat.) And she came to understand that it\u2019s a necessary process. The next morning, as the Filadelfia approached the harbour and a mobile phone signal was once again possible, the boat became simply another place of work rather than, as it was just moments before, the only world that mattered. And now it was the land that seemed suddenly mysterious: a single, unbroken entity she had found herself unable to imagine while she was at sea. Arrival was at once both exhilarating, and anticlimactic. Only when she came face to face with Lofty again did she realise how rancid she smelled \u2013 and how little her stench had mattered to her until that moment.</p> <p>Ash\u2019s book comes into the world garlanded with praise. William Dalrymple has called her a new star of nonfiction: \u201cprecise, perceptive, humane and sensitive\u201d. What will she do next? Does she have a plan? What, for her, could ever top Newlyn? \u201cI always have lots of plans,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to go to Texas for a year, and write about my family on my father\u2019s side: my grandfather was from Dallas, and after the war he set up the Marxist Leninist Society of London. For me, Cornwall is very blue, and I want to look at redness\u2026\u201d She thinks for a moment. \u201cOr perhaps I\u2019ll do a PhD about coastal communities. I need to wait for the pull.\u201d In the meantime, though, of one thing she is certain: that she must go back to using an old-fashioned \u201cbrick\u201d phone. \u201cI enjoyed listening to the men at sea. Out there, I realised how our phones are stopping us from listening, and I want to get back really to listening to people.\u201d Her eyes, which today are precisely the same colour as the English channel, meet my own, and hold them for a long minute.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Dark, Salt, Clear: Life in a Cornish Fishing Town </em>is published by Bloomsbury (\u00a316.99).

  "<p>When Hollie Pearne-Webb was growing up, she had an indoor pastime that drove her mum potty. She had fallen hard for hockey from her very first session, as an eight-year-old, at the club near her Derbyshire home. Now she hated to be without a stick in her hand. \u201cI was always knocking around a ball inside the house, hitting things,\u201d says Pearne-Webb with a laugh.</p> <p>The schoolgirl Hollie never imagined herself playing for the British women\u2019s hockey team, much less <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/19/gb-women-hockey-historic-gold-shootout-final-olympics\">scoring the winning penalty in an Olympic final.</a> But she would, at least, recognise the game Pearne-Webb has been playing on her living room carpet recently. Team GB have been training in isolation for the past fortnight \u2013 and not all of them have gardens.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2020/mar/28/scotland-v-netherlands-world-cup-1978-first-group-stage-live\">Scotland v Netherlands: World Cup 1978, first group stage \u2014 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Great Britain\u2019s captain has, so far, avoided breaking any furnishings. Most of her training is being done in her garage, converted into a makeshift gym, complete with stationary bike, bar weights and kettlebells borrowed from the neighbours. She had just finished a conditioning session when the news broke that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/24/tokyo-olympics-to-be-postponed-to-2021-due-to-coronavirus-pandemic\">this year\u2019s Olympic Games were to be postponed</a>. She was expecting it \u2013 everyone in her team was. That didn\u2019t make the disappointment any less acute. \u201cEvery part of our life is geared towards going to the Olympic Games,\u201d says Pearne-Webb, \u201cso having that moved changes so much.\u201d</p> <p>For athletes who have been mentally and physically readying themselves for peak performance in August, a 12-month delay can be a career-ender. \u201cThere are probably a few girls in the team wondering: \u2018Can I do this for another year?\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5f6e654cd6522511afa6c521cd4a35da79df112\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5f6e654cd6522511afa6c521cd4a35da79df112/0_6_1386_832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hollie Pearne-Webb\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hollie Pearne-Webb in action for England in the EuroHockey World Championships in Antwerp.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: St\u00e9phanie Lecocq/EPA-EFE</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Andthen there\u2019s the prospect of no hockey for months. The longest an international player usually goes between games is two or three weeks: the current hiatus is likely to be \u201cmuch, much longer\u201d. Happily, the team remains fully funded until next March, but Pearne-Webb still has to find a way to captain a 25-strong squad who can\u2019t be near each other. Even her long-time mentor, Kate Richardson-Walsh, who led the team to their gold medal at the last Olympics, hasn\u2019t any experience in remote captaincy.</p> <p>Like any good leader, Pearne-Webb has already identified some positives. The delayed Games gives her and the coach, Mark Hager, another year to develop a young squad of players who have stuttered since Rio. After the retirements of the power couple Kate and Helen Richardson-Walsh, Pearne-Webb\u2019s England team were knocked out in the quarter-finals of their home World Cup in 2018.</p> <p>Last year, their coach in Rio, Danny Kerry, moved to oversee the men\u2019s side and under Hager England were routed 8-0 by Holland in a record defeat in their EuroHockey semi. Back-to-back wins against Chile last autumn, to qualify finally for Tokyo, came as a considerable relief.</p> <p>So Pearne-Webb knows the bonding power of adversity. \u201cThese sort of things do gel you, going through tougher times. I know we\u2019ve felt that on the pitch throughout the last four years, which have been a bit of a rollercoaster. So although we\u2019re not together, team dynamics are pretty good and we\u2019re pulling each other along.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2c9615b6aba1dd02602d717832f6ea679581dd5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2c9615b6aba1dd02602d717832f6ea679581dd5/0_0_5192_3461/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Great Britain captain Hollie Pearne-Webb holds a scroll reading \u2018Welcome to Tokyo 2020\u201d after their victory over Chile Women in November 2019 meant they qualifued for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic games.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pearne-Webb holds a scroll reading \u2018Welcome to Tokyo 2020\u201d after their victory over Chile Women in November 2019 meant they qualifued for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic games.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Naomi Baker/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 29-year-old has always seen herself as a temporary captain, caretaking the team until the return of her good friend Alex Danson. On a holiday in Kenya two years ago, a freak accident left Danson with mild brain trauma. That life-changing injury, combined with her sister, Claire, being paralysed after a cycling accident, finally<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/20/great-britain-hockey-captain-alex-danson-announces-retirement\"> caused Danson to retire from the sport</a> in February. \u201cIt was only then it sunk in that I would be captaining the team to the Olympics,\u201d says Pearne-Webb. \u201cThen I started worrying: \u2018Am I doing what I should be? Am I doing a good job?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Her self-doubts have been helped, she says, by listening to interviews given by Richardson-Walsh (\u201cI heard her saying she only felt she got the captaincy right within the last year\u201d) but those around her have no difficulty identifying her inspirational qualities. Pearne-Webb\u2019s never-say-die attitude was key to her side\u2019s Rio triumph, not least in their final match, where Great Britain spent most of the time against the Netherlands defending their hearts out. It was her ice-cool composure, taking the final penalty shuffle, that gave them victory.</p> <p>So Pearne-Webb knows a bit about staying calm in a crisis. She\u2019s also an economics graduate and a part-time management accountant, working two days a week for the Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs, where her role includes risk assessment and financial planning. \u201cAs someone who likes to know what\u2019s going on, the current situation is a challenge,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019m breaking it down on a daily and weekly basis, what can I do right now.<em> </em>I like structure and routine, so I\u2019ve been filling my calendar every night \u2013 work, study, training, lunch and a fresh-air slot where I go out for a ride on my road bike.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/28/england-cricket-captain-heather-knight-signs-up-for-nhs-volunteer-scheme\">England captain Heather Knight signs up for NHS volunteer scheme</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While she finds the economic implications of the pandemic \u201creally quite scary\u201d, she has taken some comfort in the way it has inspired people to think about their physical activity. \u201cGoing outside once a day you see more people running than ever. I\u2019m hoping one of the things to come out of this is people finding a little bit more time for themselves.\u201d</p> <p>Gender equality is another of Pearne-Webb\u2019s concerns \u2013 hockey is a rare team sport in which male and female internationals are paid the same. In January she joined the Women\u2019s Sport Trust\u2019s Unlock campaign, aimed at breaking down the barriers that still remain for women\u2019s sport. She foresees a real danger that recent improvements in its funding and profile could suffer in an economic downturn. \u201cIt is a worry that all the hard work and the years it\u2019s taken to get to this point could be lost.\u201d</p> <p>Before then, however, there are some more immediate priorities. These include redecorating her hallway (she finds DIY therapeutic) and gym sessions with her ready-made training partner \u2013 her husband, Tom, who secretly wishes he was a professional athlete himself. And if the BBC does respond to requests to replay past Olympic triumphs to boost the nation\u2019s spirits, there\u2019s a good chance we\u2019ll get to see Pearne-Webb in action again. \u201cIt would be great if they replayed the Rio final,\u201d she says with a smile. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve actually seen it.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>You can learn a lot about yourself in times of crisis, but you learn a hell of a lot more about the person you weather said crisis with. Best to strap in and bite your tongue.

Then in full-blown Technicolor as <a href=\"https://colombiareports.com/three-women-murdered-on-first-day-of-colombias-coronavirus-lockdown/\">Cartagena</a> went into lockdown, with face masks being dealt out on street corners and a strict curfew enforced by police.</p> <p>\u201cTrust you to be stuck in a jungle in the middle of a global pandemic,\u201d messaged one friend.

Now, coronavirus has infected some of the agency\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/coronavirus\">employees and detainees</a>, which experts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/coronavirus-outbreak-us-immigration-centers\">said was inevitable</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/coronavirus\">Two detainees</a> in New Jersey Ice facilities and five employees at four facilities in Texas, Colorado and New Jersey have confirmed coronavirus cases, according to Ice. No cases have been publicly announced in southern states.</p> <p>The Trump administration has massively expanded the use of immigration detention facilities, with hardline policies that have driven the detention population to record highs. States in the deep south have opened <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/12/this-map-shows-how-radically-trump-has-changed-immigration-detention/\">more new facilities than anywhere else</a>.</p> <p>Advocates say immigrants held in Louisiana suspect Covid-19 has reached their facilities as the state becomes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/26/new-orleans-surviving-katrina-battles-covid-19-coronavirus\">a major virus hotspot</a>. At Ice\u2019s South Louisiana center, a woman alleged she saw officers in hazmat suits feeding someone through a slot in a door, Cole said. At LaSalle, Fern\u00e1ndez said, a dorm has reportedly been quarantined, and detainees believe two people have the disease.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re not giving people what they need to protect themselves, and that is social distancing,\u201d said Fern\u00e1ndez. \u201cThat\u2019s not something people can do in detention.\u201d</p> <p>Ice has said detainees\u2019 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/coronavirus\">health, welfare and safety \u2026 is one of the agency\u2019s highest priorities</a>\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSince the onset of reports of Covid-19, Ice epidemiologists have been tracking the outbreak, regularly updating infection prevention and control protocols, and issuing guidance to Ice Health Service Corps (IHSC) staff for the screening and management of potential exposure among detainees,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/coronavirus\">according to the agency\u2019s website</a>.</p> <p>Some detainees believe they will not receive fair treatment in government care. In a recorded call from Richwood correctional center in Louisiana, released by the Southeast Immigrant Rights Network and the New Orleans Workers\u2019 Center for Racial Justice and shared with the Guardian, one detainee said: \u201cThey\u2019re not going to take a facemask from anyone, from any American, to put it on an immigrant. This means we are going to die.\u201d</p> <p>Advocates say anyone in detention is likely to have a compromised immune system, but some also have pre-existing conditions. Lytle said she spoke to a 61-year-old asthmatic at Jackson Parish correctional center, another facility used by Ice in Louisiana, whom she said was \u201cvery, very worried\u201d and called to tell her people in his dorm were refusing meals.</p> <p>A woman named Denisse, whose husband is at Stewart detention center in Georgia, feared what might happen as new detainees arrived and guards came and went.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just spreading rapidly, you know?\u201d Denisse said. \u201cAnd his immune system is already weak.\u201d</p> <p>Her husband has a pre-existing condition that has become worse since he arrived at the facility in September, she said, adding that he recently underwent a procedure and uses a catheter. She shook with relief when she learned he would be released on Monday. The reason for his release was unclear.</p> <p>Hilda Jorge Perez, whose husband is at Richwood, said he had heart problems and high blood pressure. She worried that if he got infected, she would not be able to see him.</p> <p>Perez\u2019s husband was among at least 60 people who staged a hunger strike earlier this week. The protesters were forced to end the strike after officials told them they would be put in Ice\u2019s version of solitary confinement and have phone and television privileges removed, Perez said.</p> <p>Detainees at Stewart planned a similar strike. They demanded they either be released or deported instead of waiting to be infected, according to recordings of calls provided by a North Carolina advocacy group.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to eat until Ice comes here and gives us answers, and gives us a solution,\u201d one man said.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Ice accused advocates of circulating rumors about a hunger strike at Stewart, which she said never happened.</p>",

Anyone can have an idea about that but converting that into an actual deliverable program that can reach millions of people is a very complicated exercise and that is the work we are engaged in doing.</p> <p>\u201cBut the principle, I can say, is that the package would support those who have more recently been the victims of these closures that have taken place and we will be seeking to support people involved in those closures, but we will advise further details of the starting point about that.\u201d</p> <p>Morrison said the new measures would be on top of the existing coronavirus crisis package and would be announced \u201cas soon as we can\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not that far away,\u201d he said.</p> <p>ACTU boss Sally McManus, who along with Labor and the Greens <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Xuz0ZL-Nj7M\">has been pushing for a government-backed wage subsidy</a>, said she was heartened by the government\u2019s new proposal.</p> <p>\u201cThis will be a very welcome announcement for all those workers who have lost their jobs or are facing losing their jobs.\u201d</p> <p>McManus also called on the wage subsidy to be backdated in circumstances where job losses had already occurred and said it needed to be applied to small as well as large enterprises, and should apply across all categories of workers, including casuals and temporary visa holders.</p> <p>Labor also welcomed the news, but said the government needed to ensure the final product kept the relationship between employer and employee and was conditional on keeping people in work.</p> <p>\u201cIf Scott Morrison, instead of ruling this out weeks ago had been working on it then, then some of the scenes we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of weeks, we may not have,\u201d the shadow minister for industrial relations, Tony Burke, said.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of people transfer from work to the welfare system. The best approach is if we can have a wage subsidy so they can keep their connection to work, so on the other side of this, we\u2019ve got an economy that is ready to go again.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier in the day, the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said the government was looking at rolling out the program through existing payment schemes, rather than build a new payments program, like the UK proposed to do.</p> <p>\u201cWe are going to do it in an Australian way,\u201d he told the ABC\u2019s Insiders program.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to do it in a way that actually is going to be able to be delivered, using our existing systems and our existing architecture.</p> <p>\u201cJust making a broad promise without giving ourselves the capacity to deliver would not be responsible thing to do. So we are working very hard on further expanding the level of income support through businesses to enable more businesses, either to stay there or to survive through this difficult period ahead for a strong bounce back on the other side.\u201d</p> <p>Cormann gave no answers as to how that would work, other than it would be addressed through the existing welfare and tax systems.</p> <p>\u201cWell, what it means is providing significantly enhanced income support through business,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat form that will take will be announced once all of those decisions have been made.\u201d</p> <p>Morrison had previously publicly resisted calls for a government-backed wage scheme, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/coronavirus-nsw-and-victoria-set-to-tighten-lockdowns-as-pm-says-all-states-can-pursue-own-plans\">telling a press conference on Wednesday</a> that building a new payment scheme was not the answer.</p> <p>\u201cAnd that can put at great risk the sort of resources we\u2019re trying to get to people. The best way to get help to people is through the existing payment channels, through the existing tax system arrangements,\u201d he said then.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/coronavirus-gets-personal-crying-in-the-streets-as-australian-jobs-vanish-and-lives-change-forever\">Coronavirus gets personal: crying in the streets as Australian jobs vanish and lives change forever</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThat was the lesson from the GFC. Of all the money that went out in the GFC ... the key lesson was you must use existing channels for getting money to people because that is the most effective way for that to occur. To dream up other schemes can be very dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>Cormann would not say what any future package would look like for people who had already lost their job.</p> <p>\u201cWhatever support we will provide moving forward will be provided on a way that is fair and equitable. But again, when it goes to the futures of the next announcement which is to be made in the next few days,\u201d he said.</p> <p>As part of its stimulus package, the government has provided payments of up to $25,000 to businesses to cover employees wages, but there was no obligation to keep employees on.</p> <p>As businesses continue to close, Morrison has said the Australian economy will be going into a form of suspended animation or \u201chibernation\u201d, which Cormann said was about \u201cspreading the pain\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBusiness is facing a perfect storm,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re focused on helping bring down the costs, helping defer costs where that is appropriate. Working with the banks, working with state and territory governments around some of the things that we can do ourselves in our capacity as landlords for businesses in some of the properties that are owned by government.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea here is to spread the pain as fairly and as equitably as possible to as many business as possible to be there on the other side when we expect a very strong recovery.\u201d</p> <p>The states and territories are still working on a rental assistance plan, which has been on the national cabinet agenda for the past two weeks. Cormann said he believed landlords risked too much in the current climate to evict tenants, both in the commercial and residential sense, but gave no hint as to when a solution would be forthcoming.</p>",

The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said on Friday evening that from midnight people should stay home for two weeks, until 12 April, in a significant tightening of curbs on social and commercial life. <br></li> \n   <li><strong>Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro insinuated that the number of coronavirus cases was being inflated for political purposes. </strong>He added: \u201cSome people will die. I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s life.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>Syria said on Friday it was banning travel between cities and governorates</strong> as part of tightening measures to curb the spread of coronavirus. Syria has recorded five cases of corona virus so far but relief agencies worry that any outbreak could be lethal after years of conflict that has ravaged its healthcare system.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UK has again recorded its biggest daily rise in coronavirus deaths.</strong> In the last 24 hours, 181 people have died after testing positive for Covid-19. It comes after 115 deaths were recorded the day before. The UK death toll stands at 759, with 14,579 confirmed cases.</li> \n   <li><strong>Boris Johnson has tested positive for coronavirus</strong> and is exhibiting \u201cmild symptoms\u201d.

The UK prime minister, 55, said he was now self-isolating and working from home and would continue to lead the national fightback against the virus.

The country now has 64,059 confirmed cases up from 56,188 yesterday.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Spanish government has withdrawn 9,000 Chinese-made coronavirus testing kits</strong> from use after it emerged that they had an accurate detection rate of just 30%. </li> \n   <li><strong>The number of cases in Iran has risen to 32,332,</strong> while the number of deaths hits 2,378, according to the country\u2019s health ministry. </li> \n   <li><strong> </strong><strong>Covid-19 continues its spread across the African continent with 3243 cases and 83 deaths now recorded.</strong> South Africa has reported its first deaths resulting from Covid-19.

Italy had 919 new fatalities, taking the total to 9,134. The update follows a warning from the head of the country\u2019s national health institute that infections have not yet reached their peak and that lockdown measures will have to be extended.</li> \n   <li><strong>France extended its lockdown by a fortnight.</strong> France has recorded 299 Covid-19 deaths in the last 24 hours, the prime minister announced in a speech. Edouard Philippe said it was clear that the country was \u201cjust at the beginning of this epidemic wave\u201d. </li> \n   <li><strong>A spike in coronavirus patients means hospitals in and around Paris will reach saturation point within 48 hours, </strong>said the head of the French Hospital Federation.</li> \n   <li><strong>Four died on a cruise ship after the outbreak.</strong> Four people have died on a cruise ship stranded off the coast of Panama after a Covid-19 outbreak on board, the boat\u2019s owners have confirmed.</li> \n   <li><strong>The US approved a $2.2tn economic stimulus package.</strong> Congress has given final approval for a $2.2tn financial package designed to rush federal aid to workers, businesses and a healthcare system ravaged by the virus, after politicians united to overcome a last-minute attempt to delay its passage.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-28T00:40:29.843Z\">at 12.40am GMT</time></p> \n</div>"
