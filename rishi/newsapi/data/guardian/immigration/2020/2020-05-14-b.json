One likely casualty of a paired-down budget: an expansion to the state\u2019s health care program for undocumented immigrants over 65. </p> \n  <p>To help close some of the budget gap, the state will draw from $16 m in \u201crainy-day\u201d funds over three years. It will also attempt to negotiate a 10% pay cut with government workers -- cuts that will also impact Newsom and his staff.</p> \n  <p>But throughout the presentation, Newsom implored the federal government to take action, calling for support for the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/12/house-democrats-pelosi-new-3-trillion-coronavirus-relief-plan-251407\">sprawling Heroes Act</a> package, which includes $875 billion for cash for state and local governments</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe federal government, we need you.

After initial blips, which saw police break up crowds in popular areas and a sudden alcohol ban in public places after Parisians celebrated their freedom after eight weeks in lockdown, one rule was relaxed on Wednesday: from now more than 10 people can gather in a private home, but only if its primary use is as a residence.

You may have seen this photo doing the rounds of late. Initially, we had no intention of sharing the photo but now that Matt\u2019s been laughing and talking on the radio about it, I thought I'd tell you how I came to take this photo. We were out for a family swim and we bumped into Matt and his family. It was all very cool - no one else around\u2026just his (and my family) enjoying the freezing cold water and having a laugh! As we were all leaving, he very politely obliged for a photo, leaning in with his @supervalu_irl bag keeping the social distance! . As he confirmed on the radio, he was holding a bag of swim gear and towels - not cans!! Both my husband and I agreed not to share the photo publicly but it got leaked through a family WhatsApp group a few days later and boom! it was then all over social media. We felt awful and really sorry about the whole situation; we wrote an apology letter to him but never got to deliver it. After hearing him on radio today, he obviously sees the funny side and the fact that the photo ultimately turned into one of the feelgood stories of the early summer. . While we never intended that the photo should leak anywhere, we were delighted that so many people \u2013 Matt included \u2013 got so much entertainment from the result. And the result? Irish people were delighted to welcome such a friendly and globally respected actor and activist to live amongst us while enjoying his privacy and one of the few good things that the virus has thrown up \u2013 precious and hassle-free time with his family in a country that respects and cherishes the important things in life. . Also, my daughters Ashleigh &amp; Jessica @cookingwithjessica_ (aged 9 and 11) learnt a very valuable lesson. They now see how something private can so quickly go viral and spin out of control. . Anyhow, all\u2019s well that ends well. . #mattdamon #cookingwithjessica #dalkey #lockdownlife</a></p> \n     <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mummycooks/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Siobhan Berry</a> (@mummycooks) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2020-05-13T12:10:36+00:00\">May 13, 2020 at 5:10am PDT</time></p>\n    </div>\n   </blockquote> \n   <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-14T08:58:51.217Z\">at 9.58am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebd03728f08a55ecde59b6b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-14T08:41:07.764Z\">9.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>One of <strong>Australia\u2019s</strong> largest brewers is tipping 90,000 kegs of beer down the drain.</p> \n  <p>Lion, which manufactures Tooheys, James Boag, XXXX and other well-known Australian beers, collected the untapped kegs from pubs and clubs in March, after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/23/job-losses-from-australias-coronavirus-shutdown-will-be-devastating\">Australian government declared pubs and restaurants had to shut to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.</a></p> \n  <p>The beer has now passed its shelf life and will be tipped into the wastewater treatment plants at the Tooheys and XXXX breweries, which will produce biogas to offset the breweries\u2019 natural gas use and be used to brew fresh beer.</p> \n  <p>The amount to be emptied is equal to 7.8m pints, 10.5m schooners, 11.8m stubbies, or 1.8 Olympic swimming pools.</p> \n  <p>Calla Wahlquist reports here:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/may/14/australian-brewers-tip-78m-pints-of-beer-down-the-drain\">Australian brewers tip 7.8m pints of beer down the drain</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebcfae88f08a55ecde59b3c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-14T08:03:54.761Z\">9.03am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>More on the expulsion of the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) team from <strong>Burundi</strong>, days before the country\u2019s presidential election,<strong> </strong>has come from AFP: </p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>The foreign ministry, in a letter to WHO Africa headquarters and seen by AFP, said the UN agency\u2019s representative in Burundi and his three colleagues \u201care declared persona non grata and as such, must leave the territory of Burundi\u201d by Friday.</p> \n   <p>The directive, dated May 12, expels WHO\u2019s top official in Burundi, Doctor Walter Kazadi Mulombo, the country\u2019s coronavirus coordinator Dr Jean Pierre Mulunda Nkata, communicable diseases head Dr Ruhana Mirindi Bisimwa, and a laboratory expert in the testing for Covid-19, Professor Daniel Tarzy. </p> \n   <p>\u201cIt is the whole WHO team responsible for supporting Burundi in its response against COVID-19,\u201d a Burundian official told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cThey are expelled and the health minister has totally excluded WHO, accusing it of unacceptable interference in its management of the coronavirus.\u201d</p> \n   <p>The letter does not provide a reason for the decision.

There are 4,348,246 confirmed infections.The true figure is likely to be significantly higher as a result of underreporting or differing definitions of what constitutes a death from coronavirus.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Moscow ascribes over 60% of coronavirus deaths in April to other causes. </strong>The city of Moscow said on Wednesday it had ascribed the deaths of more than 60% of coronavirus patients in April to other causes as it defended what it said was the superior way it counted the number of people killed by the novel virus. At 242,271, Russia has the second-highest number of confirmed cases in the world after the United States, but with 2,212 coronavirus deaths, it also has one of the world\u2019s lowest reported mortality rates.</li> \n   <li><strong>Trump criticises Fauci\u2019s warnings over reopening. </strong>US President Donald Trump on Wednesday has criticised a warning given by top US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci this week about the dangers of reopening the economy too quickly. \u201cTo me it\u2019s not an acceptable answer especially when it comes to schools,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House, noting he was surprised by the response Fauci gave to lawmakers in testimony to the US Senate on Tuesday.</li> \n   <li><strong>Italian doctors find link between Covid-19 and inflammatory disorder. </strong>Doctors in Italy have reported the first clear evidence of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/13/italian-doctors-find-link-between-covid-19-and-inflammatory-disorder\">link between Covid-19 and a rare but serious inflammatory disorder</a> that has required some children to undergo life-saving treatment in intensive care units. The mysterious condition emerged last month when NHS bosses <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/nhs-warns-of-rise-in-children-with-new-illness-that-may-be-linked-to-coronavirus\">issued an alert</a> to doctors after hospitals admitted a number of children with a mix of <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/toxic-shock-syndrome/\">toxic shock</a> and symptoms seen in an inflammatory disorder known as Kawasaki disease.</li> \n   <li><strong>China begins testing every resident in Wuhan. </strong>Chinese authorities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/10-days-battle-wuhan-covid-19-testing-plan\">have plans to test every resident in Wuhan</a>, after a small outbreak was reported this week. The city in Hubei province, where the virus is believed to have originated with the first recorded cases, had reported few daily cases since early March and none since early April, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/now-it-starts-again-new-coronavirus-outbreaks-spark-unease-in-china\">until a cluster of six was confirmed at the weekend</a>. There is serious concern over the outbreak in Wuhan, despite the small size. He Qinghua from the bureau of disease prevention and control, told a press conference disease control was generally stable across the nation, but there were still challenges.</li> \n   <li><strong>Hong Kong to test hundreds of families. </strong>Hong Kong authorities are going to screen hundreds of families, local media is reporting, after its 23-day run of no local infections was broken with the diagnosis of Covid-19 in a 66-year-old woman with no recent travel history, and her five-year-old granddaughter.</li> \n   <li><strong>Japan is expected to lift the state of emergency for 39 of 47 prefectures. </strong>Japan is expected to lift the state of emergency for 39 of its 47 prefectures on Thursday, local media reported. The world\u2019s third-largest economy declared a nationwide state of emergency a month ago, urging citizens to reduce person-to-person contact by 80% in an effort to slow the pace of new infections and ease the strain on medical services.</li> \n   <li><strong>Japan suicides decline as lockdown causes shift in stress factors. </strong>Suicide in Japan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/japan-suicides-fall-sharply-as-covid-19-lockdown-causes-shift-in-stress-factors\">fell by 20% in April compared to 2019, the biggest drop in five years</a>, despite fears of the coronavirus pandemic causing increased stress and many prevention helplines either not operating or being short-staffed. People spending more time at home with their families, fewer people commuting to work and the start of the school year being delayed are seen as factors in the fall.</li> \n   <li><strong>New Zealand announces NZ$50bn fund. </strong>Finance minister Grant Robertson has unveiled an unprecedented NZ$50bn fund to save jobs and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/new-zealand-budget-robertson-lays-out-50bn-plan-to-return-jobs-to-pre-covid-19-levels\">reduce unemployment to pre-coronavirus levels within two years</a>. The huge figure, announced alongside the annual Budget on Thursday, equates to about 17% of the nation\u2019s GDP and 17 times more than what a New Zealand government usually allocates to new spending in its budgets. Underscoring the massive challenges facing the economy as it emerges from lockdown, Robertson said the fund was \u201cthe most significant financial commitment in modern history\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>Virus may never be eradicated \u2013 WHO. </strong>The coronavirus that causes Covid-19 could become endemic like HIV, the World Health Organization has said, warning against any attempt to predict how long it would keep circulating and calling for a \u201cmassive effort\u201d to counter it. \u201cIt is important to put this on the table: this virus may become just another endemic virus in our communities, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/global-report-who-says-covid-19-may-never-go-and-warns-of-mental-health-crisis\">and this virus may never go away</a>,\u201d said Michael Ryan, the WHO\u2019s emergencies chief.

From this perspective, the best we can hope for from most people under crisis is selfish indifference; at worst, they will swiftly turn to violence. Our worst instincts must be repressed. This becomes a justification for authoritarianism and heavy-handed policing.</p> \n  <p>But studies of historical disasters have shown that this is not how most people actually behave. There are nearly always selfish and destructive people, and they are often in power, because we have created systems that reward that kind of personality and those principles.

There are 4,347,015 confirmed infections.The true fatalities figure is likely to be significantly higher as a result of underreporting or differing definitions of what constitutes a death from coronavirus.</li> \n   <li><strong>Moscow ascribed over 60% of coronavirus deaths in April to other causes</strong>The city of Moscow said on Wednesday it had ascribed the deaths of more than 60% of coronavirus patients in April to other causes as it defended what it said was the superior way it and Russia counted the number of people killed by the novel virus. At 242,271, Russia has the second-highest number of confirmed cases in the world after the United States, but with 2,212 coronavirus deaths, Russia also has one of the world\u2019s lowest mortality rates.</li> \n   <li><strong>Trump says Fauci\u2019s warning over reopening the economy too soon as \u201cnot an acceptable answer\u201d</strong>US President Donald Trump on Wednesday described as not acceptable a warning given by top US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci this week about the dangers of reopening the economy too quickly. \u201cTo me it\u2019s not an acceptable answer especially when it comes to schools,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House, noting he was surprised by the response Fauci gave to lawmakers in testimony to the US Senate on Tuesday.</li> \n   <li><strong>Italian doctors find link between Covid-19 and inflammatory disorder</strong>Doctors in Italy have reported the first clear evidence of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/13/italian-doctors-find-link-between-covid-19-and-inflammatory-disorder\">link between Covid-19 and a rare but serious inflammatory disorder</a> that has required some children to undergo life-saving treatment in intensive care units. The mysterious condition emerged last month when NHS bosses <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/nhs-warns-of-rise-in-children-with-new-illness-that-may-be-linked-to-coronavirus\">issued an alert</a> to doctors after hospitals admitted a number of children with a mix of <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/toxic-shock-syndrome/\">toxic shock</a> and symptoms seen in an inflammatory disorder known as Kawasaki disease.</li> \n   <li><strong>China begins testing every resident in Wuhan</strong>Chinese authorities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/10-days-battle-wuhan-covid-19-testing-plan\">have plans to test every resident in Wuhan</a>, after a small outbreak was reported this week. The city in Hubei province, where the virus is believed to have originated with the first recorded cases, had reported few daily cases since early March and none since early April, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/now-it-starts-again-new-coronavirus-outbreaks-spark-unease-in-china\">until a cluster of six was confirmed at the weekend</a>. There is serious concern over the outbreak in Wuhan, despite the small size. He Qinghua from the bureau of disease prevention and control, told a press conference disease control was generally stable across the nation, but there were still challenges.</li> \n   <li><strong>Hong Kong to test hundreds of families</strong>Hong Kong authorities are going to screen hundreds of families, local media is reporting, after its 23-day run of no local infections was broken with the diagnosis of Covid-19 in a 66-year-old woman with no recent travel history, and her five-year-old granddaughter.</li> \n   <li><strong>Japan is expected to lift the state of emergency for 39 of 47 prefectures </strong>Japan is expected to lift the state of emergency for 39 of its 47 prefectures on Thursday, local media reported. The world\u2019s third-largest economy declared a nationwide state of emergency a month ago, urging citizens to reduce person-to-person contact by 80% in an effort to slow the pace of new infections and ease the strain on medical services.</li> \n   <li><strong>Japan suicides fall sharply as Covid-19 lockdown causes shift in stress factors</strong>Suicide in Japan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/japan-suicides-fall-sharply-as-covid-19-lockdown-causes-shift-in-stress-factors\">fell by 20% in April compared to 2019, the biggest drop in five years</a>, despite fears of the coronavirus pandemic causing increased stress and many prevention helplines either not operating or being short-staffed. People spending more time at home with their families, fewer people commuting to work and the start of the school year being delayed are seen as factors in the fall.</li> \n   <li><strong>New Zealand announces NZ$50bn fund</strong>New Zealand\u2019s finance minister Grant Robertson has unveiled an unprecedented NZ$50bn fund to save jobs and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/new-zealand-budget-robertson-lays-out-50bn-plan-to-return-jobs-to-pre-covid-19-levels\">reduce unemployment to pre-coronavirus levels within two years</a>. The huge figure, announced alongside the annual Budget on Thursday, equates to about 17% of the nation\u2019s GDP and 17 times more than what a New Zealand government usually allocates to new spending in its budgets.

The virus was detected in one of 81 people tested after arriving last week from Saudi Arabia and neighbouring South Africa, Lesotho\u2019s health ministry said.</li> \n   <li><strong>Former UK spy chief dismisses Wuhan lab conspiracy theory. </strong>In the UK, the former director general of the domestic intelligence service has poured cold water on White House speculation that Covid-19 may have emerged via a leak from a coronavirus research laboratory in the Chinese city of Wuhan.</li> \n   <li><strong>Public Health England approves antibody test \u2013 report. </strong>Public Health England (PHE) has reportedly approved an antibody test kit, the first to receive such an endorsement.

Out of 619 suspected patients tested in the last 24 hours, 259 came back positive, pushing the total number of infections to 5,226. The death toll reached 132, after five more patients died overnight. The number of recoveries is 648.</li> \n   <li><strong>Sweden announced it would hire up to 10,000 more care workers </strong>to address shortcomings in elderly care exposed by the pandemic. About half of the Sweden\u2019s 3,460 coronavirus-related deaths have been among nursing home residents, and another quarter among those receiving care at home.</li> \n   <li><strong>Mexico said it would reopen parts of economythe economy after 51 days of lockdown</strong>, despite the country reporting its highest number of daily deaths so far. Mexico has confirmed 1,992 new cases and 353 deaths, bringing the total death toll to 3,926 and the total number of cases to 38,324.</li> \n   <li><strong>Hotels and restaurants across Europe have been asked to enforce physical distancing</strong> between guests to allow Europeans to take their annual summer holiday.

Work will resume on 18 May at the company\u2019s engine plants in Dagenham in Essex and Bridgend in south Wales.

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Global death toll passes 300,000</h2> <p>The global death toll from Covid-19 has passed 300,000, with nearly 4.5 million people infected. According to data collected by Johns Hopkins University, at least 300,074 people have now died as a result of the outbreak and there are 4,405,688 confirmed cases worldwide.</p> <p>It\u2019s important to point out that the actual death toll is believed to be far higher than the tally compiled from government figures.</p> <h2>Sanofi will no longer prioritise the US if it develops a vaccine</h2> <p>The French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi rowed back on a promise to prioritise the US market if the company develops a coronavirus vaccine. The company\u2019s CEO Paul Hudson sparked controversy by saying the US had \u201cthe right to the largest pre-order because it\u2019s invested in taking the risk\u201d.</p> <p>The US Department of Health and Human Services has paid Sanofi $30m, Hudson said. But the French prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, said the principle that everyone has equal access to a potential vaccine is \u201cnon-negotiable\u201d.</p> <h2>Nearly 600,000 Australians have lost their jobs during the pandemic</h2> <p>Almost 600,000 Australians lost their jobs between March and April, unemployment rose to 6.2%, the underemployment rate increased by 4.9 points to 13.7% and the underutilisation rate increased by 5.9 points to 19.9%.</p> <p>The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the figures were \u201cterribly shocking, although not totally unexpected\u201d.</p> <h2>Doctors in Italy and France report spike in rare inflammatory syndrome linked to coronavirus</h2> <p>Doctors in northern Italy, one of the areas hardest hit by coronavirus, and in France have reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/13/italian-doctors-find-link-between-covid-19-and-inflammatory-disorder\">spikes in cases of a rare inflammatory</a> syndrome in young children that appears similar to one reported in the US, Britain and Spain, according to a report in the Lancet.</p> <p>The condition shares symptoms with toxic shock and Kawasaki disease including fever, rashes, swollen glands and, in severe cases, heart inflammation.</p> <h2>Donald Trump visits a mask distribution centre without wearing a mask himself</h2> <p>Donald Trump toured a mask distribution centre in the political swing state of Pennsylvania on Thursday but without wearing a mask himself.</p> <p>Trump, who is running for re-election in November, has resisted wearing a mask in public despite his administration\u2019s guidance to Americans to wear them and new White House rules requiring staff to wear them at work.</p> <h2>Concern is mounting in the Rohingya refugee camps after man tests positive for Covid-19</h2> <p>A Rohingya man has become the first person to test positive for Covid-19 in the vast refugee camps in Bangladesh that is home to almost one million people, officials said Thursday.</p> <p>Local health coordinator Abu Toha Bhuiyan initially said two refugees had been put into isolation. The World Health Organization later said one case was of a Rohingya man, and the other was of a local man who lived near the camp and was being treated at a clinic inside the area.</p> <h2><strong>36 million Americans are now unemployed as another 3 million filed for benefits</strong></h2> <p>The latest figures from the Department of Labor show the rate of claims is slowing but the record-breaking pace of layoffs has already pushed unemployment to levels unseen since the Great Depression of the 1930s.</p> <h2>Mental health problems sparked by the pandemic need urgently addressing</h2> <p>Governments, health authorities and civil society groups should urgently address mental health problems sparked by the coronavirus pandemic, the UN secretary general has said.</p> <p>Launching a policy briefing on mental health during the outbreak, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said that \u201cthe Covid-19 pandemic is now hitting families and communities with additional mental stress.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, in Australia, the national cabinet has made mental health problems its top priority and are potentially bringing in a new mental health plan and are looking to boost support services.</p> <h2>A quarter of Covid-19 patients who have died in England had diabetes</h2> <p>A quarter of Covid-19 patients who have died in hospitals in England had diabetes, according to figures released by NHS England.</p> <p>Data published for the first time <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/14/uk-coronavirus-live-antibody-test-approved-for-use-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ebd5e7d8f080c727453af74#block-5ebd5e7d8f080c727453af74\">breaks down deaths from coronavirus by pre-existing conditions</a>. Of the 22,332 patients who have died since 31 March, when pre-existing conditions began to be reported, 5,873 (26%) had diabetes, while 4,048 (18%) had dementia. Some 3,254 (15%) were reported to have chronic pulmonary disease.</p>",
  "<p>More than a thousand councillors across England have written to the government calling for free <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/schoolmeals\">school meals</a> (FSM) to be provided over the half-term and summer breaks, after ministers said there were no plans to fund them during the forthcoming holidays.</p> \n<p>At Easter, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/09/uks-poorest-families-suffering-as-free-school-meal-vouchers-delayed\">vouchers were made available</a> at the last minute to help support the most disadvantaged families and the councillors warned they would now face \u201choliday hunger\u201d as the Covid-19 crisis continues.</p> \n<p>Ordinarily FSM are only provided during term time, but the government made an exception last month because of the unprecedented levels of disruption and uncertainty facing schools and parents.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7a6078f6-5a66-4d3e-9339-5610fe320767\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.</p>\n    <p>The UN agency&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public\">advises</a>&nbsp;people to:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Frequently wash their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or warm water and soap</li>\n     <li>Cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when sneezing or coughing</li>\n     <li>Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever or cough</li>\n     <li>Seek early medical help if they have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and share their travel history with healthcare providers</li>\n     <li>Advice about face masks varies.

We believe that this should become a permanent fixture within our school system, so no child need go hungry during the school holidays again.\u201d</p> \n<p>Councillors also raised wider concerns about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/26/schools-in-england-warned-over-blind-spot-as-vulnerable-children-stay-home\">vulnerable children hidden from view</a> during the lockdown and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/27/domestic-abuse-surge-coronavirus-lockdown-lasting-impact-mps\">rising levels of domestic violence</a>. \u201cWe would ask that the government continue to work with local authorities and schools to ensure vulnerable children do not \u2018slip through the net\u2019 and the necessary financial support is available to councils to support families fleeing domestic violence,\u201d the letter said.</p> \n<p>Earlier this week the children\u2019s minister, Vicky Ford, responding to a parliamentary question, said the government had no plans to extend the scheme into future holiday periods, but the situation would be kept under review.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The government\u2019s FSM voucher scheme, administered by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/07/government-gave-national-pupils-food-voucher-contract-to-small-company\">the French-owned company Edenred</a>, has been widely criticised by headteachers who have struggled to access the scheme and parents who have suffered long delays before receiving their vouchers.</p> \n<p>Tulip Siddiq, the shadow minister for children and early years, said: \u201cMany more children are going hungry in this crisis, so this is absolutely not the time to be withdrawing support for free school meals.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere have been huge admin problems with the free school meal voucher scheme which we have been urging ministers to sort out, but it is a terrible mistake to take this crucial support away at a critical moment.\u201d</p> \n<p>Lawyers representing three children, whose mother is a care worker for older people, have launched a legal challenge against the exclusion of children from low-income families from the FSM scheme.</p> \n<p>Following an earlier legal challenge, the government was forced to extend FSM eligibility to families with no recourse to public funds (NRPF) due to their immigration status, including those who are permitted to work.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Ministers now face a further challenge over a decision to set the earnings threshold at \u00a37,400 per year, far lower than that set for other families eligible for the same support, excluding working families on a low income who are unable to access welfare benefits, including carers and NHS staff on the minimum wage.</p> \n<p>Rachel Etheridge, a solicitor at Matthew Gold and Company, said: \u201cCapping earnings at the equivalent for a family in receipt of means-tested benefits disregards the fact that NRPF households will not be able to supplement their income with means-tested benefits and will therefore be left surviving on much less than their counterparts who are able to claim benefits.\u201d</p> \n<p>Schools in England <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-uk-schools-to-be-closed-indefinitely-and-exams-cancelled\">were closed</a> on 20 March to all pupils, except children of key workers and pupils classed as vulnerable to stem the spread of the coronavirus. </p> \n<p>A Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cKeeping vulnerable children safe is our priority, which is why we have kept school places open for these children and are giving councils more than \u00a33.2bn of additional funding to support services, including children\u2019s social care. The government has also announced \u00a376m in support for vulnerable people, including those in danger from domestic abuse\u201d.</p>",

But, asked if he expected fares to have to go up, he signalled that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/transport/tfl-fares-to-stay-frozen-for-fourth-year-running-sadiq-khan-confirms-a4289311.html\">the four-year fare freeze that Khan has implemented since he became mayor in 2016 </a>would have to end. Shapps said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>On higher fares, it is very important in providing a rescue package for TfL that the London mayor can work with, that we don\u2019t end up in a situation where the people from outside the capital are unfairly carrying the burden. By which I mean - sadly I do have to do them each year - fares do end up having to rise by inflation, otherwise everyone knows there\u2019s less money going into the system.</p> \n   <p>And if you have consistent fare freezes it means that more money isn\u2019t going into the system. You can\u2019t then have an unfair settlement where other British taxpayers are effectively bailing out the system, albeit that the system in this case is in trouble because, clearly, of coronavirus. So there is the right balance to be made. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Shapps claimed the \u201cvast majority\u201d of care homes had not had any coronavirus infections.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In the vast majority of care homes, Covid-19 hasn\u2019t been reported at all.

Here, the UK stands out by offering a relatively low level of income support to employees without children who become unemployed. This is especially true compared with other European countries, whose insurance-based systems already provided a much greater level of insurance before any bespoke coronavirus schemes were implemented ...</p> \n   <p>[Taking the higher costing] the UK package represents 5.9% of national income or \u00a3123bn, comprising \u00a3118bn of spending increases and \u00a35bn of tax cuts.

Boris Johnson chaired cabinet this morning, and ministers were given an update on coronavirus, from Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser and Sir Patrick Vallance, its chief scientific adviser, and an update on Brexit from David Frost, the PM\u2019s chief Europe adviser. Surprisingly, you might think, we got a read-out on the Brexit discussion, but not on the coronavirus discussion.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Downing Street restated its claim that the EU is making unreasonable demands of the UK in the post-Brexit trade talks.</strong> David Frost, the PM\u2019s Europe adviser, gave the cabinet an update on the talks, the spokesman said. The spokesman went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>David reiterated that we weren\u2019t asking for anything special, bespoke or unique from the European Union. We\u2019re looking for a free trade agreement based on precedent similar to those the EU has already got with other countries like Canada. He said, however, that the EU had asked far more from the UK than they have from other sovereign countries with whom they have reached free trade agreements. For instance, they have asked for the same access to our waters as they did when we were still in the EU, for the UK to stay bound to their laws and rules .... Cabinet agreed that we won\u2019t agree to demands to give up our rights as an independent state, especially when the EU has shown through their agreements with other countries like Canada that these controls are not necessary. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Downing Street conceded that there will be checks on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland from next year.</strong> This is a requirement under the EU withdrawal agreement, but until recently the government had been reluctant to confirm publicly that the checks will take place. But yesterday Northern Ireland assembly members were told that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/13/brexit-will-mean-checks-on-goods-crossing-irish-sea-government-admits\">the UK government had agreed to the need for \u201cphysical posts at ports of entry\u201d in Northern Ireland under the deal</a>, and this afternoon the spokesman confirmed that this was the case. The spokesman said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There will be requirements for live animals and agrifood, building on what already happens at ports like Larne and Belfast, where checks already take place. Beyond the limited changes introduced by the protocol, there will be no changes to GB/NI trade. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>(The final line of that is a masterpiece of spin: \u201capart from the changes, there will be no changes.\u201d) The spokesman said that Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, had already made this clear to a committee last week. And Gove said it was possible to have \u201clight-touch checks which will ensure all requirements can be met\u201d, the spokesman said. </p> \n  <p>When it was put to the spokesman that this seemed to contradict what Johnson told business leaders in Northern Ireland during the general election, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/08/boris-johnson-goods-from-northern-ireland-to-gb-wont-be-checked-brexit\">when he said anyone asked to fill in new forms under the terms of his Brexit deal should just throw them in the bin</a>, the spokesman said the government was committed to ensuring the new procedures were \u201cstreamlined and efficient\u201d. (Johnson\u2019s comment came in response to a question about exports from Northern Ireland to Britain, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/13/brexit-will-mean-checks-on-goods-crossing-irish-sea-government-admits\">even trade going in that direction will be subject to new requirements under the Brexit deal.)</a><br></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said the government was at \u201can advanced stage\u201d in talks about a bailout for Transport for London.</strong> Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has said TfL will have to reduce services if it does not receive further funding by the end of today. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/14/uk-coronavirus-live-antibody-test-approved-for-use-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ebd31e98f080c727453accd#block-5ebd31e98f080c727453accd\"> 1.05pm.)</a> The spokesman said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is a commercial discussion. We remain in close contact with the mayor and TfL to look at how we can support them.</p> \n   <p>Our priority is on reaching an agreement which keeps critical services running for those passengers who must use public transport to get work, ensuring we keep London moving safely.</p> \n   <p>That means protecting key routes, rapidly increasing the number of services available and protecting the interests of taxpayers in the long term.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman confirmed that Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, has had coronavirus - without the public being told.</strong> Sedwill, who is also national security adviser, is the most powerful civil servant in Britain. He was ill around the time the PM was ill. But Sedwill continued working, the spokesman said. When it was put to him that journalists had been misled, because they weren\u2019t told at the time that Sedwill was ill despite questions being asked at lobby, the spokesman said that he personally only became aware recently that Sedwill had been ill and that Sedwill had continued to work over that period. This is from Sky\u2019s <strong>Sam Coates.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SamCoatesSky/status/1260913102255730694\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Mark Sedwill did have Coronavirus roughly at the same time as the PM.<br><br>Number 10 failed to come clean on this in those critical moments.

Or when they have someone who has tested positive, they know to use that... if they are accepting a discharge back to the care home, they know to put in place those isolation rules and those isolation procedures.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Earlier, the former health secretary<strong> Jeremy Hunt </strong>told the programme that it was \u201cpretty clear now\u201d that community testing should not have been abandoned on 12 March. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important not to finger point at the individuals, and I think the government is getting excellent scientific advice,\u201d he said. </p> \n  <p>\u201cBut actually, to ask why it is that Sage, the government\u2019s scientific advisory committee, didn\u2019t model the South Korean test, track and trace approach that we are now adopting right at the beginning?</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe government was given two very extreme options, the sort of extreme lockdown we\u2019re just coming out of, or kind of mitigated herd immunity.

It\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/simon-murphy\">Simon Murphy</a></strong> here kicking off the UK live blog coverage today. It emerged last night that an antibody test which can determine whether someone has had Covid-19 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/public-health-england-approves-roche-test-for-coronavirus-antibodies\">has been approved by Public Health England</a>. </p> \n  <p><strong>Boris Johnson</strong> has previously described antibody testing as a \u201cgame-changer\u201d as it can help determine how much of the population has been infected, raising the prospect those who have had the disease may be immune. However, whether a person who has overcome Covid-19 is immune and if so, how long that immunity lasts, are still very open questions.</p> \n  <p>The test, made by the Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche, detects whether antibodies are present in someone\u2019s blood. Prof John Newton, national coordinator of the UK coronavirus testing programme, told the Daily Telegraph that experts at PHE\u2019s Porton Down labs had evaluated the test and confirmed the 100% accuracy. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThis is a very positive development, because such a highly specific antibody test is a very reliable marker of past infection,\u201d he said. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This in turn may indicate some immunity to future infection, although the extent to which the presence of antibodies indicates immunity remains unclear.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Later this morning at 9.30am MPs on the <strong>Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy</strong> select committee will look into the impact of the pandemic on businesses and workers. It comes days after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/manual-workers-likelier-to-die-from-covid-19-than-professionals\">official figures showed </a>that people in low-paid, manual jobs face a much greater risk of dying from coronavirus than higher-paid, white-collar workers. </p> \n  <p>At 11am cabinet will meet to discuss the ongoing pandemic. This afternoon at 2pm, the <strong>Office for National Statistics</strong> is expected to give the clearest picture yet of how many people in England have currently got Covid-19 when it releases the results of its infection survey. <strong>The Health and Social Care Committee</strong> will hold an evidence session on delivering core NHS services at 2.30pm.

  "<p>More than 140 world leaders and experts have called for future <strong>Covid-19 vaccines</strong> to be made available to everyone free of charge, amid growing tensions between drug companies and governments and a boycott of vaccine summits by the US.</p> <p>Vaccines and treatments for the virus should not be patented, say the signatories to an <a href=\"https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2020/may/20200514_covid19-vaccine-open-letter\">open letter</a> published in the run-up to next week\u2019s meeting of the World Health Assembly, the policy-setting body of the UN\u2019s World Health Organization. Instead, scientific breakthroughs must be shared across borders, they urge.</p> <p>The signatories include <strong>South Africa\u2019s</strong> president, Cyril Ramaphosa; <strong>Pakistan\u2019s</strong> prime minister, Imran Khan; and the former <strong>UK</strong> prime minister Gordon Brown. </p> <p>\u201cGovernments and international partners must unite around a global guarantee which ensures that, when a safe and effective vaccine is developed, it is produced rapidly at scale and made available for all people, in all countries, free of charge,\u201d the letter says, adding that poorer countries should not be left at the back of the vaccine queue.</p> <p>The plea came as a French pharmaceutical company stirred outrage by saying any vaccine it discovered would be reserved for Americans in the first instance, and as global confirmed deaths from the virus passed 300,000, <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker</a>.</p> <p>Paul Hudson, the British chief executive officer of <strong>Sanofi</strong>, said any vaccine would go to the US first since it had done the most to fund the company\u2019s research. \u201cThe US government has the right to the largest pre-order because it\u2019s invested in taking the risk,\u201d Hudson told Bloomberg.</p> <p>The European commission and health experts responded furiously, pointing out that Paris-based Sanofi has received tens of millions of euros in the form of research credits from the French state in recent years. </p> <p>The French government described Hudson\u2019s remarks as unacceptable, while the German press pasted the firm as a soulless and disloyal multinational willing to blackmail governments to extract lucrative subsidies.</p> <p>Last week Britain, China, Canada, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Japan, and numerous African countries took part in a <strong>global Covid-19 summit</strong>. The virtual meeting raised more than $8bn for a potential vaccine. The Trump administration refused to send a representative, however, and appears determined to pursue its own unilateral vaccine path.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/14/gordon-brown-coronavirus-must-be-eradicated-in-every-continent\">report published on Thursday</a>, Brown pointed out that a second or third wave of Covid-19 infection could come from poor countries with undeveloped health systems. The solution to the problem was global, he said, adding that the pandemic would end only when the virus was \u201ceradicated in every continent\u201d.</p> <p>As many as 100 forms of vaccine are being tested. The WHO sees seven or so as frontrunners. On Wednesday its emergencies chief, Michael Ryan, said the coronavirus \u201cmay never go away\u201d and could become a regular endemic disease like the flu.</p> <p>The WHO\u2019s director for Europe, Hans Kluge, said vigilance was needed to keep the virus at bay, as well as cooperation between people and politicians. He noted that new virus clusters had emerged in places where Covid-19 had apparently vanished, such as Wuhan in <strong>China</strong>, and <strong>South Korea</strong>.</p> <p><strong>France</strong>\u2019s prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, said the French could take holidays this summer but only in France and French overseas territories. This would be allowed if there were no second wave of coronavirus, he said</p> <p>Philippe promised a decision by 25 May as to whether French restaurants, bars and caf\u00e9s could open on 2 June. The aim would be for premises to reopen in areas designated \u201cgreen\u201d, where the virus is not circulating and hospital intensive care units are not \u201csaturated\u201d with Covid-19 patients. He gave no date for those in \u201cred\u201d areas.</p> <p>The government announced a generous financial rescue plan for France\u2019s tourism industry, which used to welcome 90 million tourists a year. Philippe said tourism was suffering its \u201cgreatest challenge in modern history\u201d.</p> <p>Since Monday, French shops have reopened and some children are back at school. The relaxation of lockdown has caused a few blips, with police breaking up crowds in popular areas. An alcohol ban has been imposed in public places after some Parisians over-celebrated their freedom. On Wednesday another rule was relaxed: more than 10 people can now gather in a private home.</p> <p>In other developments:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Japan</strong>\u2019s<strong> </strong>prime minister, Shinzo Abe, lifted a state of emergency in large parts of the country, including a majority of prefectures. He said it would remain in place in Tokyo and in the second-largest urban area, Osaka, until the virus was contained.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Qatar </strong>introduced a law threatening citizens and residents with three years in jail or a \u00a345,000 fine if they leave home without a face mask.

One reason is that rates tend to be low. You can now get a loan for 2.19% and that is going to tilt the balance to where it\u2019s cheaper to buy than to rent in some cases.</p> <p>\u201cThe top end will be hit by lack of confidence and borrowing capacity but lower end might be ok if the government comes in with more stimulus.\u201d</p>",

Police have since said the officers knocked and announced themselves before entering.</p> <p>Lawyers for Taylor\u2019s family and her boyfriend Kenneth Walker, who was with Taylor that night, say they did not. Walker said he thought he was witnessing a home invasion, prompting him to pick up his gun and fire a shot that hit an officer in the leg after a battering ram plowed through the apartment\u2019s door.</p> <p>Police responded by firing more than 20 times.

They\u2019re doing live classes via Zoom and, quite to my delight, I was not only able to figure out how to use Zoom, but I also painted this in the process! No museums are asking to display my first still life painting, but I feel just a LITTLE bit more peaceful from the process... and I got to see real life other people who were also taking the class - and real gift right now!

  "<h2>FOOLS RUSH IN?</h2> \n<p>Eager to test the waters before a possible return for the Premier League in June, assorted media outlets have decided to gauge the public mood by confecting a controversy involving Public Enemy No 1, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. Much like Covid-19, the Tottenham manager can also be something of an infective agent renowned for latching on to hosts with potentially adverse consequences, so it seemed fitting to get his view on Project Restart. But with conflicting reports of his views emerging, it\u2019s difficult to know exactly what he thinks.</p> \n<p>Following Wednesday\u2019s meeting addressing the health concerns of Premier League managers and players, one tabloid reported that Jos\u00e9 was vociferous in his attempts to get the mooted return to competitive action delayed by a week so his players could get match fit, while others claimed he is eager to don his hazmat suit and start barking orders from the touchline as soon as possible. \u201cI have not asked for any delay,\u201d he said on Thursday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/14/jose-mourinho-desperate-for-premier-league-to-restart-as-soon-as-possible-tottenham-manager-bundesliga\">by way of clarification</a>. \u201cI want to train and I am desperate for the Premier League to return as soon as it is safe to do so, particularly now as we are seeing other leagues preparing to return to action.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/14/jose-mourinho-desperate-for-premier-league-to-restart-as-soon-as-possible-tottenham-manager-bundesliga\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho 'desperate' for Premier League to restart as soon as it is safe</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Further south, both geographically and more crucially in the Premier League table, Brighton striker Glenn Murray seemed less enthused about the rush to get back to the office, a view that is believed to be shared by his manager Graham Potter, as well as a number of top-flight counterparts. \u201cFootball isn\u2019t necessarily a necessity \u2013 it\u2019s a game, it\u2019s a sport,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/14/premier-league-is-rushing-us-into-a-return-says-brightons-glenn-murray\">said Murray</a>, using the words \u201cnecessity\u201d and \u201cnecessarily\u201d in far more close proximity than was absolutely necessary. \u201cI mean, what if we go through all this rigmarole of trying to get back started and we have a second peak and we\u2019re stopped anyways? I just can\u2019t understand after just sort of loosening the lockdown why we\u2019re in such a rush to get it back. Why can\u2019t we just wait sort of a month or so to see if things go to plan?\u201d</p> \n<p>While the social media stampede to rubbish Murray\u2019s views as those of a player at a struggling club who is desperately trying to avoid relegation was entirely predictable, those accusing him of opportunism should perhaps have paused before going on the attack. With no coherent plan on which all clubs agree in place to finish the season and fears of a second spike all too real, the delay he is proposing would actually increase both the top flight\u2019s chance of being played to a conclusion and with it, the likelihood of Brighton going down.</p> \n<h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> \n<p>\u201cWhat will it be like without the hug at the start or end of games with the opposition manager? Here in Italy there are so many people I want to embrace, for so many different reasons. And how will I offer support to my players, in the tough moments, without the hug? The hardest thing for me to imagine is the dressing room without the hug. That simple gesture transmits something that words could never manage to do\u201d \u2013 Roma coach Paulo Fonseca sounds like he\u2019s struggling with social distancing.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0948cd5595b62523575131bf14e5f02f847e70a9\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0948cd5595b62523575131bf14e5f02f847e70a9/0_0_1587_1058/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hugs wanted, by order of the Roma coach.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hugs wanted, by order of the Roma coach.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: DeFodi Images/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>RECOMMENDED LISTENING</h2> \n<p>A bumper treat for your ears, with the latest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/audio/2020/may/14/blackburn-rovers-premier-league-title-remembered-and-the-threat-to-amateur-football-football-weekly-extra-podcast\">Football Weekly Extra podcast</a> and our new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/audio/2020/may/13/football-farce-and-fascism-at-the-1936-olympics-forgotten-stories-podcast\">Forgotten Stories of Football series</a> too.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3c387973-310d-4b96-876e-3b883c4ed1d1\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>FIVER LETTERS</h2> \n<p>\u201cRe: Dennis Rowe\u2019s complaints at \u2018Big Paper\u2019s continuing negative coverage of the proposed Saudi-funded takeover of Newcastle\u2019 (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters).

  "<p>A teacher from Sierra Leone has spent 28 years battling the Home Office for permission to remain in the UK, even though lawyers say he has had a legal right to be in the country from the start.</p> <p>Osman Bash Taqi, 55, known as Ossie, has found himself in an extraordinary catch-22 scenario which has spanned six governments, from John Major to Boris Johnson, and seen the immigration goalposts moved more times than he can count.</p> <p>The key obstacle for Taqi being granted leave is his failure to produce his Sierra Leone passport. He has been unable to produce it because the Home Office lost it.</p> <p>Initially the Home Office denied ever having it but a recent letter from a Home Office official confirms they have a record of his passport. \u201cHaving had a look through Mr Taqi\u2019s records it appears that we have seen a passport issued in 1993,\u201d the Home Office letter to his MP, Toby Perkins, states.</p> <p>In November 2018 an immigration judge ruled that his passport was in possession of the Home Office.</p> <p>Taqi arrived in the UK in December 1992 for the wedding of his sister shortly after the outbreak of civil war in his home country. The situation there deteriorated to the point where it was unsafe for him to return. He made various applications for leave to remain which the Home Office refused although it was accepted that it was too dangerous for Sierra Leonians to return home while the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/mar/02/sierraleone\">civil war</a> was raging.</p> <p>He began a relationship with an Italian woman and the couple moved in together in 1998 and went on to have three children: Felan, 20, Kai, 18 and Naeem, 14. Felan was offered a place at Oxford University to study maths and engineering but after a year there had to abandon his studies because of the trauma and depression his father\u2019s immigration situation caused him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bc3fdb97c93742248cbde5ef6f746271894641b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc3fdb97c93742248cbde5ef6f746271894641b1/0_0_480_640/375.jpg\" alt=\"Taqi said his 20-year relationship with his partner had broken down due to the years of stress of trying to secure his immigration status.\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taqi said his 20-year relationship with his partner had broken down due to the years of stress of trying to secure his immigration status.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: family handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The couple decided to marry in 2010 but he was told he could not marry without Home Office permission and needed to submit his passport. He was not given permission to marry by the Home Office and his passport was not returned to him.</p> <p>He then made an application for leave to remain in September 2015 based on having an EU partner but this was unsuccessful due to his missing passport. The Home Office also questioned the genuineness of his relationship with his partner despite their years together and their three children.</p> <p>When the Home Office refused his application he was denied a right of appeal.</p> <p>By the time he did get a chance to go back to court, in 2018, his 20-year relationship with his partner had broken down due to the years of stress of trying to secure his immigration status and his inability to work due to Home Office rules.</p> <p>\u201cOur children are all AA students but the situation with the Home Office has affected all of us dramatically. It has destroyed our family unit,\u201d said Taqi. \u201cI no longer know how sane I am. I cannot eat, I cannot talk, I cannot sleep. I\u2019m raging against the injustice of all this. The situation has devastated my whole family. I\u2019m trying to hang on for the sake of my children.\u201d</p> <p>His solicitor, Louis MacWilliam, of Truth Legal Solicitors said that when he first met Taqi he assumed that given his length of residence in the UK and his three Italian children he must be hiding something serious from his past.</p> <p>\u201cHe was not. It became clear he has suffered from a harsh system of rules that are forever changing,\u201d said MacWilliam. \u201cOssie\u2019s case is deeply troubling. He has had a clear legal basis to stay for many years. I hope someone at the Home Office shows some humanity and quickly resolves his case.\u201d</p> <p>His most recent application for leave to remain is under the EU settlement scheme as a dependent parent of his EU children. Again the Home Office initially refused his application due to him not having his passport. In June 2019 he was given permission to make an application by post. In October 2019 the Home Office changed the rules again saying that for parents of EU citizens dependency was no longer a given.</p> <p>He does not know if that rule change and his lack of a passport will again stand in his way. He continues to wait for a decision.</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said<strong>: </strong>\u201cAll applications are considered on a case-by-case basis in line with the immigration rules and this has been no different for Mr Taqi.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>All British and Irish citizens born in Northern Ireland will be be treated as EU citizens for immigration purposes, the government has announced after a landmark court case involving a Derry woman over the residency rights of her US-born husband.</p> <p>The move is a major victory for Emma de Souza ending a three-year battle to be recognised by the Home Office as Irish, a right enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement (GFA).</p> <p>De Souza said: \u201cThis is great news. To get a concession from the British government and a change in the immigration law is no small feat.</p> <p>\u201cIt is incredibly satisfying to be considered as EU citizens and will be a great help to all the other families in my situation.\u201d</p> <p>Her husband, Jake, will now be allowed to remain in the UK indefinitely if he applies for the EU settlement scheme, an immigration status for all EU citizens wanting to remain in the UK post-Brexit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/EmmandJDeSouza/status/1260897059038732288\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We&#39;ve been waiting a long time to see &quot;the people of Northern Ireland&quot; in that EEA category, for recognition of our unique status and our EU rights and entitlements.

This is the date the EU settlement scheme closes.</p> <p>\u201cWhile this is satisfying, it has not given legal effect to the Good Friday Agreement right to be Irish. Ireland updated its immigration laws to bring them into line in 1998 but the British did not,\u201d said de Souza. \u201cIt is still an uphill battle.\u201d</p> <p>The Home Office announced the move in a \u201cstatement of changes in immigration rules\u201d in the House of Commons on Thursday.</p> <p>\u201cThe rule changes also mean that family members of British or dual British-Irish citizens from Northern Ireland will be able to apply for status under the EU Settlement Scheme.</p> <p>\u201cThis delivers on the commitment the UK government made in the <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/856998/2020-01-08_a_new_decade__a_new_approach.pdf\">\u2018New Decade, New Approach\u2019 agreement</a> in January 2020 which restored the power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland,\u201d it said.</p> <p>The Home Office said it would start accepting applications on 24 August and only those who are living in the country at the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December this year would be eligible.</p> <p>It also pointed out that De Souza lost her court case and the court had ruled that her nationality derived from the jurisdiction she was born in under the law.</p> <p>It said the immigration rule changes \u201cdemonstrate the UK government\u2019s continued and unwavering commitment to the Good Friday Agreement\u201d.</p>",

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Italian doctors find link between Covid-19 and inflammatory disorder</h2> <p>Doctors in Italy have reported the first clear evidence of a link between Covid-19 and a rare but serious inflammatory disorder that has required some children to undergo life-saving treatment in intensive care units. The mysterious condition emerged last month when NHS bosses issued an alert to doctors after hospitals admitted a number of children with a mix of toxic shock and symptoms seen in an inflammatory disorder known as Kawasaki disease.</p> <h2>Deaths worldwide near 300,000</h2> <p>The number of lives lost worldwide in the pandemic is nearing 300,000, according to Johns Hopkins University figures, with 297,197 deaths reported. There are 4,347,015 confirmed infections. The true figures are likely to be significantly higher as a result of underreporting or differing definitions of what constitutes a death from coronavirus.</p> <h2>Japan lifts state of emergency for 39 of 47 prefectures</h2> <p>The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has lifted the state of emergency for 39 of its 47 prefectures, but said it would remain in place in Tokyo, as well as the second-largest urban area of Osaka, until the coronavirus is contained. Abe also said he would begin work on a second extra budget as part of his government\u2019s economic stimulus measures. \u201cWhile controlling the spread of the virus as much as possible by acting on the premise that the virus is all around us, we will restore ordinary work and daily life,\u201d Abe told a news conference.</p> <h2>French firm\u2019s pledge to prioritise US with vaccine causes outrage</h2> <p>The British head of a French pharmaceutical company has caused an outcry by saying any vaccine discovered by his firm would initially be reserved for the United States. Paul Hudson, chief executive officer of Sanofi, told Bloomberg News that any vaccine invented by his firm would go to the US first since it had done the most to fund the company\u2019s research. France\u2019s higher education minister, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Vidal, said Sanofi\u2019s plan to give the US priority access would be \u201cincomprehensible and disgraceful\u201d since a successful vaccine must be \u201ca public good for the world\u201d.</p> <h2>EU monitoring Hungary over emergency legislation</h2> <p>The European commission has said it is monitoring the Hungarian government over coronavirus laws that created a state of emergency with no end date. The commission, the body charged with upholding European Union law, said the absence of a clear time limit on the emergency decree raises \u201cpotential concerns as regards legal certainty\u201d, while a media law criminalising the spreading of misinformation about the pandemic \u201cmay have a chilling effect on freedom of expression in Hungary\u201d.</p> <h2>Burundi expels four-person WHO team ahead of elections</h2> <p>Burundi\u2019s foreign ministry, in a letter to the World Health Organization\u2019s Africa headquarters, said the UN agency\u2019s representative in Burundi and his three colleagues \u201care declared persona non grata and as such, must leave the territory of Burundi\u201d by Friday. The letter did not provide a reason for the decision. Diplomatic and administrative sources told AFP the foreign ministry aborted a similar attempt to expel the same four officials a month ago. The east African nation is scheduled to hold a presidential election on 20 May.</p> <h2>Afghanistan records biggest one-day rise in coronavirus cases</h2> <p>Afghanistan has recorded its biggest one-day rise of new cases as the health ministry warned of a second phase of transmission amid war raging with full intensity across the country. Wahid Majroh, the deputy health minister, has warned the nation that if it continued to break the lockdown there would be another phase of the virus. The health ministry recorded 413 new transmissions over the past day, the biggest one-day rise of new cases, and four deaths, raising the total number of infections to 5,639 and the death toll to 136.</p> <h2>Lloyd\u2019s of London expects to pay out up to \u00a33.5bn</h2> <p>Lloyd\u2019s of London, the world\u2019s biggest insurance market, expects to pay out between $3bn (\u00a32.4bn) and $4.3bn (\u00a33.5bn) to its customers due to the coronavirus pandemic, as it warned of a $203bn hit for the entire industry. The Lloyd\u2019s of London chief executive, John Neal, said the pandemic was an unparalleled event. \u201cWhat makes Covid-19 unique is the not just the devastating continuing human and social impact, but also the economic shock,\u201d he said. \u201cTaking all those factors together will challenge the industry as never before.\u201d</p> <h2>Burr\u2019s cellphone seized by federal agents</h2> <p>US federal agents have seized the cellphone of Republican senator Richard Burr as they investigate stock transactions made in the early days of the coronavirus crisis. Burr has denied any wrongdoing and said he relied solely on news reports to guide decisions on stock sales, amid reports that he and other senators sold off shares after being briefed on the risks of the crisis.</p> <h2>US-Mexico border factories pressed to stay open despite Covid-19 risk</h2> <p>Mexico\u2019s border states are home to more than 6,000 <em>maquiladoras</em> \u2013 largely foreign-owned factories that manufacture products for export \u2013 and the plants, which employ hundreds of thousands of people, have been the focus of several coronavirus outbreaks. But official <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/us-mexico-border-factories-coronavirus\">efforts to keep the factories shut</a> and contain the spread of Covid-19 have come under intense pressure from companies \u2013 and US government officials \u2013 who have urged the Mexican government to keep the <em>maquiladoras</em> running at any cost.</p> <h2>Spain says death toll rise highest in six days</h2> <p>Spain\u2019s daily coronavirus death toll report rose above 200 on Thursday for the first time since 8 May, the health ministry reported. The overall death toll from the disease rose to 27,321 on Thursday as 217 people reportedly died overnight, the ministry said, according to Reuters. The overall number of diagnosed cases rose to 229,540 on Thursday.

  "<p>The scholar Peter Dronke, who has died aged 85 following kidney failure, rejected the idea of \u201cthe Dark Ages\u201d. The era between ancient Rome and renaissance Florence may have been overshadowed and neglected, but he set out to show how richly inspiring it was \u2013 and enlightened.</p> <p>In the early 1980s, when many feminists were searching out lost heroines and exemplars, Dronke became the most significant literary archaeologist of a largely vanished corpus: in books such as Poetic Individuality in the Middle Ages (1970) and <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/il/academic/subjects/literature/anglo-saxon-and-medieval-literature/women-writers-middle-ages-critical-study-texts-perpetua-marguerite-porete?format=PB&amp;isbn=9780521275736\" title=\"\">Women Writers of the Middle Ages</a> (1984), he brought the abbess Hildegard of Bingen into public consciousness, his work leading to widely popular <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NGTsdL2YzE\" title=\"\">recordings of her music</a>.</p> <p>His reading of a beleaguered ninth-century Carolingian noblewoman, <a href=\"https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/dhuoda\" title=\"\">Dhuoda</a>, whose children had been taken from her during the dynastic rivalries of the time, remains a masterclass in listening to \u201ca mind and presence of ... sensitive originality\u201d.

Peter Dronke\u2019s highlighting of her contribution led to widely popular recordings of her music.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His streak of feminist partisanship was inextricably intertwined with a profound commitment to a language of tolerance and equality and a lifelong resistance to the pessimistic Augustinian Christian tradition. One dazzling study followed another as Dronke put his considerable mental powers to repositioning neglected philosophical approaches to the body and sexuality, to social justice and ethnic stereotyping, to redressing the picture of cultural exchange across social classes, and rehabilitating vernacular forms and popular expressions: songs, ballads, legends, myths \u2013 and film.</p> <p>His first book, for example, Medieval Latin and the Rise of European Love-Lyric (two volumes, 1965\u201366), argued that far from \u201ccourtly love\u201d originating with the troubadours in France, it developed within a stream of poetry and song from demotic Latin and the Arab world, with deep roots far from Provence \u2013 in ancient Egypt, Baghdad, Georgia, India and Iceland. Above all, Dronke believed in the power of imagination and acted with exceptional acuity to unfold the beauty and ethics of its creations, from a towering work such as Dante\u2019s Divine Comedy to a little known, anonymous lyrical Lament of Dido.</p> <p>The underlying resistance to hierarchies and unquestioned authorities was strengthened by his marriage in 1960 to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/25/ursula-dronke-obituary\" title=\"\">Ursula Brown</a>. She was a scholar of Icelandic and Old Norse, the editor and translator of the Poetic Edda, a collection of mythological and heroic poetry. Together they wrote Growth of Literature: The Sea and the God of the Sea (1997-98), a lively account of Tritons, selkies (seal folk) and sirens north and south. When she and Dronke were going on a visiting fellowship to the US, she was refused a visa \u2013 she had joined the Communist party at the age of 15.</p> <p>Born in Cologne, Peter came from a family of scholars, teachers, lawyers and civil servants \u2013 largely freethinkers \u2013 on his father\u2019s side, while on his mother\u2019s he inherited interests in poetry and psychology. She was Maria Kronfeld, an actor in Berlin, who continued performing after her marriage till 1936, when the racial laws prevented her \u2013 she was part Jewish, though herself a devout Catholic. Peter\u2019s father, Adolf Dronke, a judge, was opposed to the Third Reich, and dismissed on account of his wife\u2019s Jewish background.</p> <p>At the end of 1938, with the help of Catholic contacts, Maria left Germany for Britain. Four months later Peter and his sister followed her, accompanied by their nanny, who hid money between the stuck-together pages of an art book. Their father joined them, but too late for British work permits; the family was offered a choice of emigration to Brazil or New Zealand. The papers for the latter arrived first, and they sailed to Wellington, arriving in August 1939.</p> <p>Adolf worked in a prosthetic limb factory and \u2013 confidentially \u2013 as a government censor of German documents. He helped found the national orchestra, where he played double bass and cello; at home the family organised quartets of their friends. Maria increasingly directed plays rather than acted. Their Wellington household reproduced the hospitable and cultured world of Mitteleuropa before the Nazis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c5c2a330cba470d5cf066a389d42c0c661b0b8f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5c2a330cba470d5cf066a389d42c0c661b0b8f3/0_106_1139_1424/800.jpg\" alt=\"Born in Cologne and brought up in Wellington, New Zealand, Peter Dronke baffled colleagues at Oxford when he arrived as a polyglot Kiwi fired up by abstruse medieval writings, music and the latest Japanese movies\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Born in Cologne, Peter Dronke baffled those he met at Oxford when he arrived from Wellington as a polyglot Kiwi fired up by abstruse medieval writings, music and the latest Japanese movies</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: None</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Peter leapt a couple of years at Catholic schools and entered Victoria College, Wellington (now Victoria University of Wellington), when he was only just 16. When he won a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1954, those he met there were baffled by this polyglot Kiwi who was fired up by abstruse medieval writings, music and the latest Japanese movies.</p> <p>After gaining an Oxford degree (1957) he became a junior research fellow at Merton College, and in 1961 moved to Cambridge as a lecturer in medieval Latin, rising to professor (1989-2001), and then emeritus. He told me he chose to become a fellow of Clare Hall, Cambridge, as it was then the only college to admit women fellows alongside men.</p> <p>Though his health declined after Ursula\u2019s death in 2012, he produced unstoppably: a new edition of the Roman 6th-century philosopher <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/boethius/\" title=\"\">Boethius</a> and a trailblazing in-depth introduction and commentary to the radical ninth-century theologian <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scottus-eriugena/\" title=\"\">John Scotus Eriugena</a> (the name means Irish-born). His Periphyseon (On the Natures of the Universe, five volumes, 2012-17) openly dismisses scriptural literalism: it was \u201ctoo simple-minded, thinking that paradise was some place on earth, that the trees were earthly and the fountains physically perceivable. True Reason laughs at this.\u201d </p> <p>During numerous hospital stays, Dronke continued another pioneering study, of <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/35977/35977-h/35977-h.htm\" title=\"\">Heloise\u2019s questions to Abelard and his responses</a>, after the 12th-century lovers were separated and confined in different religious establishments. In all these last works, he kept faith with seven decades of intellectual devotion to the cause of reawakening the voices of thoughtful, life-loving men and women whose controversial views brought them into trouble and, eventually, disrepute and silence.</p> <p>Dronke had a meticulous scholastic mind, and a vast appetite for difficulty and toil. He was also a hedonist, an ardent theatre-, concert- and filmgoer (especially to the screenings of work from Iran, for example, at the London Film festival) and an unwavering European (until Ursula\u2019s death they went every summer to their house in Brittany). He never attuned himself to the computer age: he must have been one of the last writers to post typewritten manuscripts to his publisher. He cuts an unlikely figure for an old pagan savant, but so he was. </p> <p>He is survived by a daughter and two grandchildren.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Ernst Peter Michael Dronke, scholar of medieval Latin literature, born 30 May 1934; died 19 April 2020</p>",
  "<p>In 2011, Diana Quick starred in a one-woman play built around 11 Skype calls from a mother to her daughter. Judy makes video recordings from her home in north London, speaking about her work with various charitable organisations and asking her daughter, Helen, to call back. Helen, working in the Palestinian city of Hebron, maintains an icy silence.</p> <p>Originally directed by Michael Longhurst for the HighTide festival, the drama has been revived by Longhurst for the Donmar Warehouse, where he is artistic director, with Quick returning as the charismatic, domineering Judy.</p> <p>Its central theme of remote communication and the socially distant way it was filmed (using a webcam) is fitting for our times, and Adam Brace\u2019s script adapts so well for the screen that it could have been written for the medium. As Judy makes her video calls, her computer screen becomes ours and the backdrop is various rooms of Quick\u2019s own home. The decision to keep its original setting of 2010, with all its political references (to Gordon Brown and Nick Clegg among others), is a judicious one. The play is less about the limits of remote technology and more about communication itself \u2013 or the lack of it \u2013 between a mother and a daughter.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSy_QM9yNN8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GSy_QM9yNN8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>It begins with Judy\u2019s \u201csozzled\u201d ramblings on New Year\u2019s Day (she tells Helen about the previous night\u2019s party, the black ice outside, the gritters, even the colour of her \u201cpower\u201d drink), and the babble seems like a wilful distraction from all she wants to say to Helen.</p> <p>Later, she makes a wry joke about having a \u201cone-way conversation\u201d with her daughter but it sounds like a Freudian slip. \u201cI barely know anything about your life in Hebron,\u201d she says, and quickly changes the subject back to herself.

  "<p>Lily has no health insurance, no doctor and no savings.</p> <p>The 57-year-old Los Angeles caregiver contracted coronavirus last month at work and survived after weeks of agony and isolation in her bedroom. Without access to healthcare, she drank boiled ginger and tried basic flu remedies common in her native Philippines. Lily made it, but at least two other Filipino caregivers in the city have succumbed to the virus.</p> <p>Covid-19 has devastated Los Angeles, infecting people of all incomes and backgrounds, but the suffering has not been equal. The damage has been particularly brutal in communities that have long faced systemic racism and health and economic inequities, including the black essential workers of South LA, the Latinx factory workers now sewing masks and the immigrants of Historic Filipinotown.</p> <p>In addition to disparities in the number of cases and deaths, victims of the pandemic fear the unequal toll will only become starker as California inches toward reopening \u2013 with those who most need help least likely to get it.</p> <p>\u201cI cannot get the support from the government because I\u2019m undocumented,\u201d said Lily, who asked not to use her full name.

In reality, the data showed that these white communities were getting more tests, foreshadowing that lower-income people of color would have unequal access to Covid-19 healthcare \u2013 and worse outcomes.</p> <p>By mid-April the data indicated that the virus was clearly overwhelming LA\u2019s <a href=\"http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/docs/RacialEthnicSocioeconomicDataCOVID19.pdf\">disadvantaged communities</a>: \u201cOnce here and spreading locally, it multiplies inequality,\u201d said Andrew Noymer, a UC Irvine epidemiologist.</p> <p>Now it\u2019s clear that the <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-11/institutional-racism-inequity-high-minority-death-toll-coronavirus\">people who live in high-poverty areas</a> have nearly four times as many Covid-19 deaths (29 per 100,000 people) compared with LA areas with low poverty rates. <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-28/l-a-county-releases-first-neighborhood-breakdown-of-covid-19-deaths-poor-areas-hit-hard\">Working-class city neighborhoods</a> such as East Hollywood, South LA and Westlake are especially hard hit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d29c490655cfcd6058da091dfbc365f8f15a6e16\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d29c490655cfcd6058da091dfbc365f8f15a6e16/0_85_768_461/500.jpg\" alt=\"people bump elbows at clinic\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Black Worker Center coordinator Mindy Garland, right, at a free testing clinic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Janel Bailey</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-11/institutional-racism-inequity-high-minority-death-toll-coronavirus\">racial disparities</a> in deaths are also disturbing.

Black and Latinx residents ages 18 to 64 are also dying more frequently than others, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-25/coronavirus-takes-a-larger-toll-on-younger-african-americans-and-latinos-in-california\">according to the LA Times</a>.</p> <p>\u201cPeople say, \u2018We\u2019re all in this together,\u2019 but that phrase is misleading,\u201d said Janel Bailey, of the LA Black Worker Center, whose uncle died of the coronavirus. \u201cIn South LA, we\u2019re all in this together as far as having to advocate for resources. People talk about the peak and curve, but the virus is going to hit very differently for us.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Those who can\u2019t stay home: \u2018No time off, nothing\u2019</strong></h2> <p>The inequities in LA\u2019s case numbers in part reflect whose labor is considered \u201cessential\u201d in the city \u2013 and who <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/03/us/coronavirus-stay-home-rich-poor.html\">cannot afford to stay home</a>.</p> <p>The crisis has been particularly dire among the city\u2019s undocumented Filipino caregivers, who often work multiple jobs in private homes and assisted living facilities, taking care of elderly and disabled people. Westlake, the neighborhood that includes Historic Filipinotown, has <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-28/l-a-county-releases-first-neighborhood-breakdown-of-covid-19-deaths-poor-areas-hit-hard\">four times</a> the Covid-19 death rate seen by the county as a whole.</p> <p>Because many caregivers find work through agencies and are classified as independent contractors, they typically have minimal job protections and benefits. \u201cI have no paid time off, no sick leave, no health insurance, nothing,\u201d said Emily, a 61-year-old worker who cares for a 91-year-old client and sends her income to her children and grandchildren in the Philippines.</p> <p>\u201cMy kids are worried about me,\u201d Emily said. \u201cThey say, \u2018Don\u2019t go to work.\u2019 But if I don\u2019t go, then there\u2019s no pay.\u201d</p> <p>Emily\u2019s fears of Covid-19 escalated dramatically after the virus killed one of her childhood best friends from the Philippines, who also moved to the US and was a retired nurse: \u201cIn her last hours, I could only see her through Zoom.

Caregivers have struggled to get basic personal protective equipment at their jobs, she said, and generally can\u2019t get unemployment if they have lost work.</p> <p>PWC members who have contracted Covid-19 also often have no safe or easy way to quarantine. In Westlake, more than one-third of housing units are considered overcrowded, according to one <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-22/how-does-overcrowded-housing-affect-the-spread-of-coronavirus\">recent analysis</a>.</p> <p>Soriano Versoza said she knew of one shared house with 18 residents, mostly caregivers, where two people had recently contracted the virus.

Since undocumented people won\u2019t be getting $1,200 stimulus checks, the California governor has opted to provide $500 to them during the crisis, and LA\u2019s mayor launched a <a href=\"https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2020/04/13/coronavirus-los-angeles-garcetti-prepaid-debit-card-low-income-families/\">prepaid debit card program</a> that provides $700 to $1,500 for low-income Angelenos.</p> <p>Lily, the caregiver who survived coronavirus, said she was hoping to get back to work soon and was grateful that state and local leaders were offering some financial support.</p> <p>A month after contracting Covid-19, she was still waiting for those funds to arrive in the mail.</p>",

It might be worthwhile if Peter Dutton remembers that he has a day job that is to be the minister for home affairs in the government of Australia. I mean to look at his Twitter feed and his public commentary, you think he\u2019s moonlighting as the opposition leader there in Queensland. </p> \n   <p>I\u2019m not sure if that is the job he really wants, but it would be important for him to do his day job, particularly when we see the 22<sup>nd</sup> death from the Ruby Princess. </p> \n   <p>In fact, the deaths from the Ruby Princess if you count the north-west Tasmanian outbreak, which seems to have been linked as well to the Ruby Princess, are over 30.

To be included in the labour force, you must be available for work and \u2018actively seeking it.\u2019 For many, there was no point seeking work in April (or actually impossible to do so.)

Include them and suddenly unemployment is now 2.1 million \u2013 not the official 823,000. That\u2019s an unemployment rate equal to 15% of the adjusted labour force.</p> \n   <p>However, to get a true picture of unemployment, we also need to account for the big drop in hours of those who did work. <strong>Average monthly hours for those still employed fell by 7 hours per worker for the month of April, or by 5%. That\u2019s the loss of another 600,000 full time equivalent positions.</strong> That takes genuine unemployment to almost 20%.</p> \n   <p>Anyone claiming unemployment was \u2018not as bad as expected\u2019, has not worked through how the misleading \u20186.2% unemployment rate\u2019 is constructed. <strong>A more meaningful number is 20%.</strong></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-14T04:57:29.402Z\">at 5.57am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebcce8a8f08a55ecde59a4c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-14T04:52:31.478Z\">5.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Tony Burke</strong> convinces <strong>Tony Smith </strong>it is and <strong>Angus Taylor</strong> is called to the despatch box:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Of course, I didn\u2019t refuse an interview with the New South Wales police, and as the NSW police have said in their responses to questions on notice in the NSW parliament, we replied, answered questions and provided documentation, Mr Speaker.</p> \n   <p>Now, Mr Speaker, I remind those opposite that they made this political police referral last year and, since then, the NSW police have considered and closed this matter.

At $1,100, this is effectively a doubling of that safety net that was previously in place. Now, Mr Speaker, as ... the honourable member will know, some six million Australians are now covered by the businesses that have formally enrolled for the payment, together with the jobkeeper payment, together with the 1.6m that are on the jobseeker payment. </p> \n   <p>We\u2019re talking over half the Australian workforce. </p> \n   <p>But I could also let the honourable member know through the PM\u2019s work, through the national cabinet, the work of the premiers and the chief ministers, they\u2019ve set out a three-stage framework for lifting restrictions. </p> \n   <p>Treasury have forecast that the benefit to the economy, and to jobs, from lifting those restrictions, based on the health advice, will be some 850,000 jobs and $9.4bn to the economy. </p> \n   <p>Now, in relation to those, who work in the arts and the recreation sector, if those three stages are followed through, 76,000 jobs will be created, or people will get back to work in that particular sector. When you look at opening pubs, cafes, and other entertainment venues and other venues you\u2019re looking at a $2.4bn dividend to Australia. </p> \n   <p>We know we needed to put in place temporary, targeted, proportionate measures in response to the biggest economic shock that Australia has ever seen. A $320bn or 16.4% of GDP \u2013 this is a very substantial requirement, as is required at this very difficult time. </p> \n   <p>But there are stories right across this country, some that I\u2019ve repeated in in House today and yesterday, where our jobkeeper program and our jobseeker program are saving lives and livelihoods.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c62c57dee3f143a02839be0f9d9a79b6f65d1d14\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c62c57dee3f143a02839be0f9d9a79b6f65d1d14/0_230_4714_2830/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prime pinister Scott Morrison and treasurer Josh Frydenberg during Question Time in the House of Representatives.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prime minister Scott Morrison and treasurer Josh Frydenberg during Question Time in the House of Representatives.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-14T05:00:48.674Z\">at 6.00am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebccba08f080c727453a938\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-14T04:41:17.232Z\">5.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>David Littleproud</strong> took a dixer on drought management and came up with their furphy:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The next drought starts the very first day after it stops raining.

  "<p>We are still in the early chapters of the Covid-19 story and it\u2019s too soon to judge the full impact of the pandemic. But one can tentatively discern six negative trends for Europe. These had all emerged before the virus struck but are now accelerating. In various ways they are all likely to help the cause of anti-EU populists: greater economic autarky, stronger borders and more hostility to green policies.</p> <h2>Deglobalisation</h2> <p>Covid-19 has given extra ammunition to those arguing for greater national or European self-sufficiency. Long before it arrived, there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/28/era-globalisation-brexit-eu-britain-economic-frustration\">talk of \u201cdeglobalisation\u201d</a> and \u201creshoring\u201d of supply chains. This stemmed in part from politics: Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist policies threatened international supply chains, as did the UK\u2019s pursuit of a hard Brexit.</p> <p>Economics is also important: wage differentials between emerging economies such as China and rich countries are narrowing, reducing the advantages of off-shoring production.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/eu-faces-existential-threat-if-coronavirus-recovery-uneven-paolo-gentiloni\">EU faces \u2018existential threat\u2019 if coronavirus recovery is uneven</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now concerns about the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/human-use/docs/guidelines_isc_en.pdf\">security of the supply of drugs</a>, medical equipment and even key components for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/20/coronavirus-every-major-uk-and-european-carmaker-to-stop-or-cut-production\">car industry</a>, alongside greater suspicion of Chinese companies, have boosted the case for more national or European autonomy of supply chains.</p> <h2>Nation-first politics</h2> <p>National capitals are gaining more clout vis-a-vis the EU\u2019s institutions. For decades these institutions have been losing ground to the member states, which resent the powers that Brussels has accumulated.</p> <p>The key capitals assert their authority in hard times. They did it a decade ago during the financial and eurozone crises, when they had to provide the bailout money.</p> <p>Now they have done so again. The European commission has struggled to keep the 27 together and to coordinate their responses to Covid-19 \u2013 not only because most of the key powers on health, fiscal policy and frontiers reside at national level, but also because many people look to national leaders to navigate the difficulties.</p> <h2>Tighter borders</h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/05/is-the-schengen-dream-of-europe-without-borders-becoming-a-thing-of-the-past\">EU has been strengthening</a> the Schengen zone\u2019s external border since 2015, when numbers of people seeking refuge in Europe first surged in significant numbers. Some governments also introduced checks on borders within the Schengen area.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"644803a71b6a67d388cbebf5ef84fa50972eb320\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/644803a71b6a67d388cbebf5ef84fa50972eb320/0_0_4000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vehicles wait in long lines to cross into Romania from Hungary at the Csan\u00e1dpalota border crossing on 22 March, after Hungary closed its borders to all but its own citizens.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vehicles wait in long lines to cross into Romania from Hungary at the Csan\u00e1dpalota border crossing on 22 March, after Hungary closed its borders to all but its own citizens.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Drone Media Studio/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The health emergency has increased suspicion of foreigners and in March the EU\u2019s Schengen-area countries<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/coronavirus-france-on-war-footing-as-europe-locks-down-macron\"> closed their external border</a> to non-essential travellers. More obstacles to movement within the Schengen area have also sprouted. At some point governments will have got the virus largely under control, but they will then be very wary of softening the Schengen border. Visitors from parts of the world where the disease may still be rampant will not be welcome. Many politicians will want to make life as difficult as possible for irregular migrants.</p> <h2>Green backlash</h2> <p>The pandemic is likely to strengthen opposition to policies that are designed to moderate the climate crisis and make us live greener lives. Before the virus arrived, populists such as the Sweden Democrats, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/mar/18/climate-change-denial-germany-far-right-afd\">the AfD in Germany</a>, Nigel Farage in the UK and the <em>gilets jaunes</em> (yellow vests) in France were using <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/29/elites-must-not-burden-gilets-jaunes-with-climate-change-says-eu-official\">hostility to green policies</a> as a means of drumming up support.</p> <p>Many voters whose standards of living are dropping dramatically will not want to take a further hit to jobs and incomes from measures designed to tackle the climate emergency. Europe\u2019s leaders insist that their plans for curbing carbon emissions are sacrosanct. But as the recession bites, the pressures on them to moderate their green agenda, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/27/carmakers-accused-of-using-covid-19-weaken-environmental-laws\">including from industry</a>, will strengthen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"51553a2c0317fcfc2bacad1ff7a4f439117943d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51553a2c0317fcfc2bacad1ff7a4f439117943d4/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gilets jaunes protesters gather at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris on 16 February 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>Gilets jaunes</em> protesters gather at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris on 16 February 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julien de Rosa/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>East-west tension</h2> <p>For several years an east-west division has left Hungary, Poland and sometimes other central European states at odds with the rest of the EU. They have rowed over the distribution of irregular immigrants, with some eastern countries refusing to take any; targets for reducing carbon emissions, with the easterners tending to depend on coal; and the rule of law, with Poland and Hungary disregarding the independence of the judiciary and media pluralism.</p> <p>Covid-19 has widened the rift. Central Europeans fear that they will lose money from the EU budget to the southern countries most afflicted by the virus. Meanwhile Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n has used the pandemic as a justification for introducing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/hungary-jail-for-coronavirus-misinformation-viktor-orban\">rule by decree</a>, exacerbating fears that he is creating a de facto dictatorship.</p> <h2>North-south tension</h2> <p>The virus is widening the north-south fissure which emerged in the eurozone crisis 10 years ago. Germany, the Netherlands and their northern allies were reluctant to give substantial help to the southern countries in difficulty.</p> <p>Now the coronavirus has struck the EU asymmetrically. The southern countries, particularly Italy and Spain, have suffered more coronavirus deaths than most others, started the crisis with higher levels of debt and depend on industries such as tourism that are badly affected. They want solidarity from the north, ideally in the form of some sort of \u201ceurobond\u201d: the EU as a whole would borrow money and then disburse grants to the worst-affected countries.</p> <p>EU leaders have agreed to set up a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/eu-risks-break-up-over-coronabonds-row-warns-italian-pm\">recovery fund</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/eu-risks-break-up-over-coronabonds-row-warns-italian-pm\"> </a>to support the worst-affected regions. But this seems likely to provide more in the way of loans than grants, because the northern governments remain opposed to large-scale transfers to the south \u2013 although the southerners already have excessive levels of debt.</p> <p>This stinginess is rooted in northern voters\u2019 hostility to transfers. But it delights populists such as Matteo Salvini, in Italy, who is skilled at exploiting every perceived slight from the EU. One recent <a href=\"https://www.dire.it/10-04-2020/446061-sondaggio-dire-tecne-aumentano-gli-italiani-che-vorrebbero-uscire-dallue/\">opinion poll</a> found that 49% of Italians wanted to leave the EU.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77bc6c8806f6d8d60e7b08452fe3f83c6431d1bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77bc6c8806f6d8d60e7b08452fe3f83c6431d1bb/0_918_2385_2385/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lega party leader Matteo Salvini in Rome last month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lega party leader, Matteo Salvini, in Rome last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alessandro Serran\u00f2/AGF/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>None of these changes is to be welcomed. If Europe pushes self-sufficiency too far, it will impair the benefits that trade delivers to all continents. Closing frontiers within the Schengen zone or on its borders, once Covid-19 is under control, would achieve very little. And when the EU is faced with transnational challenges such as economic depression, a pandemic or climate change, it needs strong central institutions.</p> <p>EU leaders should not slacken in their efforts to tackle climate change. The east-west rift is alarming and cannot be resolved by tolerating disrespect for the rule of law. As for the north-south divide, the ECB may be able to do enough to keep Italy and other southern member-states in the eurozone. But the politics of an unresolved rift may turn very nasty, increasing anti-EU sentiment across the bloc \u2013 and could even trigger a country leaving the EU or the euro.</p> <ul> <li><p>Charles Grant is the director of the Centre for European Reform</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>A week before Sierra Martin\u2019s 27 February due date, she received an email. It was from the couple that Martin was carrying a baby for, as a gestational surrogate.

I love him, but I know that he has to go back to his own parents eventually.\u201d</p> <p>Martin and baby Steven are caught up in a nationwide surrogacy crisis of growing proportions. Commercial surrogacy is legal in some US states, making it a hotspot for parents looking to have children through assisted reproduction. But the coronavirus travel ban has seen President Trump close the country\u2019s borders to almost all international visitors, while a nationwide US passport office shutdown has made it impossible for parents who do manage to get into the country to obtain the necessary documentation to take their children home.</p> <p>As a result, babies are being born without their parents present at the birth (immigration authorities will only let parents in once the surrogate has given birth to the child). In at least one case, a mother flew from France to attend the birth of her child, only to be turned back by border control. Some parents aren\u2019t being allowed in the country at all. </p> <p>Surrogates and surrogacy agencies are scrambling to look after babies themselves. \u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented for a surrogate to be looking after the baby,\u201d says Rich Geisler, a Californian surrogacy lawyer. \u201cWe as an industry really try to avoid that. We want to avoid the possibility of the surrogate bonding with the child.\u201d</p> <p>Martin is adamant that she\u2019ll be able to give Steven back to his parents when the time is right. \u201cIt will be hard to give him back, because I\u2019ll miss him,\u201d Martin says. \u201cBut I know he\u2019s not mine, and that I have to give him up, which is totally OK with me.\u201d She pauses. \u201cBut there\u2019s definitely a bit of attachment there,\u201d Martin says. \u201cI care for him. When you love on a baby, you love on a baby.\u201d</p> <p>To avoid leaving children in the care of their surrogates, with the emotional challenges this can entail, some surrogacy agency workers are taking babies into their own homes. \u201cI never anticipated something of this nature happening,\u201d says Katie Faust, a 26-year-old surrogacy case worker from Tampa Bay. Faust is caring for a three-week-old baby girl, whose name we have withheld at her parents\u2019 request.</p> <p>When it became apparent that her parents, a heterosexual couple living in China, would be unable to collect her, Faust, her husband, and three children flew to California to collect the baby, rented a car, then drove for five days back to Florida. (As the baby doesn\u2019t have a passport, they couldn\u2019t take her on a commercial flight.) \u201cWe\u2019re just kind of planning it as we go along,\u201d says Faust. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to figure out a way to get her reunited with her parents as soon as we can. But I\u2019m OK looking after her, until they get here.\u201d</p> <p>For the parents on the other end of the coronavirus shutdown, there is an excruciating wait to meet their children for the first time. \u201cI feel really sad about almost everything to do with my son\u2019s birth,\u201d says John, a 41-year-old airline worker from Shanghai.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/surrogacy-new-parents-stuck-in-us-amid-covid-19-shutdown\">Surrogacy: new parents stuck in US amid Covid-19 shutdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>John\u2019s baby son with his partner Will, a 39-year-old finance worker, was born on 24 February: they have not been able to enter the US to meet him due to the travel ban. (Both men have requested anonymity, as they are not out to their employers.)</p> <p>When Trump issued an order preventing Chinese nationals from entering the US in January, John wept. \u201cI cried and cried,\u201d he remembers. \u201cIt was really important for me to be there for the birth.\u201d</p> <p>Fortunately, Will\u2019s elderly parents live in Portland, and are caring for the baby. \u201cWe speak to the baby by WeChat almost every day,\u201d says John. \u201cWhen I look at his photos or videos, I feel like my heart is melting.\u201d But Will\u2019s parents are elderly, and he worries what would happen should they, or the baby, fall sick with coronavirus \u2013 the baby is uninsured, as the shutdown means they can\u2019t get the documentation they would need to insure him. John wants more than anything to get into the US and bring his son home. \u201cHere in China, life is returning to normal,\u201d John says. \u201cI think the US government should open the border, so I can get my son. Most people here are healthy and do not have the disease.\u201d</p> <p>In addition to the logistical challenges of arranging care for a child you have never met on the other side of the world, the shutdown means that parents like John and Will are missing out on those precious early months with their children. Martin is sending Steven\u2019s parents pictures and videos, but it\u2019s not the same. \u201cFor Steven\u2019s sake it would be nice for him to bond with his parents instead of with me,\u201d Martin says. \u201cThose first three months of his life are instrumental in the bonding process for the baby.\u201d</p> <p>And even if you can get into the US to collect your child, your problems don\u2019t end there. Surrogacy is an expensive process. Having to wait in the US for the passport office to reopen \u2013 at the moment, it is only issuing documents for life-and-death emergencies, which do not include surrogacy \u2013 all add to the cost. \u201cPeople are running out of funds,\u201d says New Jersey reproductive lawyer Melissa Brisman. \u201cThey\u2019ve already spent so much money on this. They can\u2019t afford another \u00a32,000 a week on a certified nurse to take care of the baby.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c289c0a27644c38a2c7ec31b4524c2595d7bc47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c289c0a27644c38a2c7ec31b4524c2595d7bc47/0_174_1599_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Tcik family with their newborn child.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Tcik family with their newborn child.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Tcik family</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I speak to Nir Tcik, he sounds almost frantic. \u201cWe are under huge pressure, because every day our money is getting lower and lower,\u201d he says. Tcik, 47, and his husband Avi, 46, are from Israel, where same-sex surrogacy is illegal. Their daughter Noga was born on 2 April. Since Noga\u2019s birth, the family of four \u2013 the Tciks have a four-year-old son, also born via surrogate \u2013 have been stuck in a New Jersey hotel room, waiting in vain for the authorities to issue her a birth certificate. Even when the birth certificate comes through, they will probably still be stuck, unless the Israeli embassy can make an exception and issue Noga emergency travel documents to fly home, in lieu of a US passport.</p> <p>The Tciks did not budget for nearly two months in the US. They estimate they have spent almost $20,000 in additional costs due to the coronavirus shutdown, on top of the approximately $150,000 cost of the surrogacy. \u201cIf this goes on much longer,\u201d Tcik says, \u201cwe are going to have to borrow money from family and friends.\u201d</p> <p>He is terrified that Noga will fall ill \u2013 as Noga has no official paperwork, she is uninsured. As a result, the Tciks are terrified to take her outside, lest she contracts coronavirus. \u201cWe are stuck in this hotel,\u201d says Tcik. \u201cAll the time, we\u2019re in this hotel room. We don\u2019t feel safe.\u201d</p> <p>The solution, Brisman says, is for the US immigration authorities to allow parents into the US to collect their children, and expedite the process by which they can leave the country. \u201cI would like to see the government allow these people in quickly, and allow them home quickly,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need expedited passports, birth certificates and visas for people whose babies are being born.\u201d</p> <p>The administrative and bureaucratic nightmare in which the Tciks now find themselves means that coronavirus has cast a pall over what should be a joyful experience. \u201cWe thank God that we have a daughter who is healthy, and that the surrogate is also OK,\u201d says Tcik. \u201cThat is the most important thing. But this coronavirus shutdown, and us being stuck here, has ruined everything.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It was late at night on 30 April and Wajid Hussain was still in his office when the phone rang. A voice on the other end, 5,000 miles away from him in Pakistan, brought news that felt like a punch to the stomach: police in the Swedish city of Uppsala confirmed that a body found in a river a week before was that of his older brother, the exiled journalist Sajid Hussain. Sajid had been missing for almost two months.</p> <p>According to Uppsala police, while an autopsy has been carried out, the exact cause of Sajid\u2019s death has yet to be determined. \u201cInitially there was a suspicion of him being murdered,\u201d said Karin Rosander, a spokesperson for Uppsala police. \u201cThose suspicions have now lessened but we have nothing definite right now.\u201d </p> <p>Yet for Sajid\u2019s family and friends, it has been a strange and unnerving case. How did this soft-spoken but fearless Pakistani journalist, who had just optimistically begun his new life in the safety of Sweden, end up dead in the murky depths of the Fyris River?</p> <p>In the last phone conversation the two brothers would ever have, Sajid had been full of future plans, advice and his usual sprinkling of wisdom beyond his years. Since he had been forced to flee his home in Pakistan\u2019s troubled Balochistan region in 2012, after his investigative journalism earned him death threats and visits from the police, Hussain had bounced miserably from Oman, to Dubai, to Uganda, separated from his family and unable to do the work he lived for.</p> <p>But having arrived in Sweden in 2018, and been granted political asylum in 2019, he had finally found some peace. \u201cHe was very happy and settled and never shared anything that made us think he was afraid,\u201d said Wajid. \u201cI can never know what he was thinking internally but with everyone he spoke to, he shared his happiness and joy about life in Sweden. He had always wanted to do two things, journalism and literary work, and in Sweden he was finally doing both.\u201d</p> <p>Sajid had found a job as a part-time lecturer at Uppsala University and was assisting on a project to develop the world\u2019s first digital Balochi language dictionary. He was due to start his masters in Iranian language and literature this year and three months earlier his wife had been interviewed by the Swedish embassy to start the process of joining him with their two young children.</p> <p>Wajid added: \u201cSajid always wanted to come back to Pakistan and always hoped one day to be able to live there again. But obviously he was in a much safer position in Sweden. Well, that\u2019s what we thought anyway.\u201d</p> <p>But at 11am on 2 March, Sajid boarded a train from Stockholm to Uppsala, to pick up the keys for a new flat he was due to move into. \u201cSajid was always very supportive and like an elder brother to me,\u201d said his Stockholm flatmate Abdul Malik. Malik would also be the last person to speak to Hussain, a brief phone call at around 2pm to confirm he had got to Uppsala. After that, the line went silent.</p> <p>After news of Hussain\u2019s disappearance, the press freedom organisation Reporters Without Borders did not hold back its suspicions that his death could have been the work of the Pakistan authorities. Pakistan is one of the most dangerous countries in the world to be a journalist and the threats have been known to reach beyond the country\u2019s borders. In February, Ahmad Waqass Goraya, a Pakistani dissident blogger living in Rotterdam, was attacked outside his home by two figures allegedly from the Pakistan intelligence agency. \u201cWhen you think about who could find interest in suppressing a dissident journalist, the first hypothesis leads to Pakistan\u2019s security agencies,\u201d said Daniel Bastard, the Asia Pacific head of Reporters Without Borders.</p> <p>Even after fleeing, Hussain had continued to expose human rights abuses back in Pakistan. In 2015, concerned at what he saw as a growing intolerance of critical journalism in the region, Hussain had co-founded the Balochistan Times, an online newspaper, publishing articles about the controversial subjects of forced disappearances and human rights abuse in his home region. The website remains banned in Pakistan but the day before he disappeared, on 1 March, Hussain and co-founder Sameer Mehrab had spoken over the phone to discuss how they could expand their operations and push the boundaries of their journalism.</p> <p>\u201cWe were talking about expanding our team, picking new people to work with and making plans for the future,\u201d said Mehrab. \u201cHe was fine and behaved as he always did. He talked of focusing on his career, expanding the Balochistan Times and his hopes to pursue a PhD as well as continue his commitment to writing and journalism.\u201d</p> <p>Mehrab said that Hussain had never spoken of facing threats in Sweden. \u201cHe was a kind person, not street smart,\u201d he added. \u201cEven if he was being watched or followed, he would never have noticed.\u201d</p> <p>Hussain was born on 16 January 1981 into a well-known political family in Balochistan. His uncle Ghulam Mohammad Baloch was a leading figure in the Balochistan nationlist movement and was assassinated by the Pakistan military in 2009. After studying economics at Karachi University, Hussain began working as a journalist in 2007, focusing mainly on stories of enforced disappearances in Balochistan as well as exposing one of the most influential drug lords in Pakistan.</p> <p>But it was his during his investigations in 2012 on a story about enforced disappearances for the news agency Reuters, at a time when the United Nations team was arriving in Pakistan to look into the issue, that Hussain began to face threats, anonymous phone calls to his home and sensed he was being followed. Plainclothes police officers turned up at his house, questioned his family and took his documents and his laptop.</p> <p>Security services then turned up at the door of a hotel room where Hussain and the Reuters journalist were working, looking for him. Hussain escaped through another door and fled home, and emailed the first chapter of his draft novel to a friend with the words: \u201cRemember! This is the rough draft. Don\u2019t make it public at any cost. If in any case something happens to me, hand it over to my daughter, when she is grown up.\u201d He fled to Oman a week later.</p> <p>But according to those closest to him, Hussain had voiced no similar fears in the days and months before he disappeared in Uppsala on 2 March. Carina Jahani, a professor at Uppsala University who worked alongside Hussain and described him as \u201cexceptionally intelligent and talented\u201d, said the pair had plans to meet on 4 March. Sebastian Strid, a classmate and student of Sajid\u2019s, described how three days before his disappearance the pair had sat for two hours after class discussing poetry and had a beer in the train station before heading back home to Stockholm.</p> <p>\u201cWe talked about all sorts of things: that his family might come to Sweden soon, about the Balochi cuisine, about fun clips on YouTube,\u201d said Strid. \u201cHe appeared to be in a good mood. He said that I had to visit his place the next weekend and we would cook something together, talk about the Balochi language and hang out. That was the last time I saw him.\u201d</p> <p>Hussain\u2019s family have steered clear of placing the blame on anyone, but expressed frustration at what they see as the slow pace of the investigation. Finally in late March the case was shifted to the international organised crime unit. It will now be at least another couple of weeks until the final autopsy analysis result is expected, which will determine whether the prosecutor will pursue the case further.</p> <p>\u201cSajid always pursued the truth, he never spared anyone no matter how powerful, but he never accused anyone without having evidence in hand,\u201d said Wajid. \u201cThat is all we are asking from Swedish police. He may not be important to the Swedish government but he was very important to us, to the people of Balochistan, to the people of Pakistan.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Blackburn had waited 81 years for another league title and led Manchester United by two points going into the final day of the 1994-95 season.

He personally rang about 10 different people about my character and temperament before signing me. He would sometimes join in at training and at 44 he was still sometimes the best player we had!</p> \n<p>When I first arrived we used to train at Pleasington, which were basically Sunday League pitches that had dog mess on them, next to a crematorium. Training would often have to stop as the hearses rolled past. On my first day Kenny was on [his assistant] Ray Harford\u2019s shoulders, masking tape to the crossbar. The wind was horrendous so they used some breeze blocks to hold down the net. Some days we just used corner flags for goalposts. We would go back to Ewood for lunch where they would just cook spare ribs and sausages. Everyone just got on with it. But then Jack Walker bought the new training ground for a quid. It used to be an asylum, so we fitted in all right there.</p> \n<p>The team spirit was great, if anyone got too big-time they\u2019d be smashed down in the dressing room. We\u2019d stay in London before matches and players would get fire extinguishers through the door. For the 1995 Charity Shield everyone got a new suit and shirt but somebody cut the sleeves off mine and Chris Sutton\u2019s. We got on the bus to go to Wembley, everyone was silent, nobody said a word.

When things went silent in the second half I thought we had blown it. When Jamie Redknapp scored the winner and I landed on the deck I thought we\u2019d lost it. But within a few seconds our fans got news from West Ham. Kenny was so superstitious he didn\u2019t even organise a party. We didn\u2019t want to go out in Manchester so we went to somewhere called \u201cBistro French\u201d in Preston.

Now the recovery is routine but back then these injuries were finishing careers. I was 23 and in a knee brace at Anfield but had travelled on the team bus and was in the dressing room beforehand. I watched the game from the dugout, which is really tight at Liverpool and my leg was all squashed. All the Liverpool fans were keeping us updated on the United score. We tried to block it all out but it was impossible. When the final whistle finally blew it took forever for me to get on the pitch but I threw my crutches away and managed it.</p> \n<p>With Kenny as manager, being the legend he was, winning it at Anfield was surreal. The way the Liverpool fans were was special but it was a mixed day for me because of the injury: I felt angry, sorry for myself but also delighted and proud. I nearly didn\u2019t pick up a medal as I didn\u2019t think I deserved one but Kenny and Tim Sherwood gave me a bit of a rollicking and made me pick one up.</p> \n<p>Tim was fundamental to us winning it, especially after David Batty\u2019s injury. He was a hard guy, a brutally honest, understated, undervalued player, despite being captain. But he also had real courage on the ball in tight situations,was a tough tackler and got into the box, often got beyond the strikers. Him and Mark Atkins were superb in central midfield, another player who never gets mentioned but scored some really important goals.</p> \n<h2>Matt Smith, actor and lifelong Rovers fan</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5a41a1c1d07082084460081cd061e1946b7669c7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a41a1c1d07082084460081cd061e1946b7669c7/957_329_938_1172/800.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Smith, who has featured in Doctor Who and the Crown, played for Nottingham Forest and Leicester City in his youth.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matt Smith, who has featured in Doctor Who and The Crown, played at the Nottingham Forest and Leicester academies in his youth.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Wooller/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>My dad is from Darwen and the reason I support Rovers.

There were balloons everywhere, it was party time. A carnival day. Lots of Rovers fans had transistor radios and the whole ground erupted when news came that West Ham had scored and again when the final whistle went [at Upton Park]. Liverpool won the day and we won the league. It was perfect.</p> \n<p>I\u2019m 83 and first started going to watch Rovers in 1946. I\u2019ve been a season-ticket holder for decades. We believed Jack Walker was putting Blackburn back where they should be. Shearer was magic, wasn\u2019t he? And Sherwood held the thing together. We\u2019ve been down a bit since Jack died but we\u2019re on the up again and don\u2019t need too much more to get us back in the Premier League.</p>",
  "<p>I seem to have spent much of the lockdown inside the minds of teenagers. Two of the books that I have been able to finish, despite having difficulty concentrating, have been coming-of-age stories about teenage girls, by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/annie-ernaux\">Annie Ernaux</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/elena-ferrante\">Elena Ferrante</a>. Ernaux\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/books/annie-ernaux-a-girls-story.html\">A Girl\u2019s Story</a>, published by Fitzcarraldo, fills a lacuna in the French author\u2019s ongoing multiple-memoir project, telling of an early, traumatic sexual experience in 1958 that has taken her six decades to write about. Ferrante\u2019s forthcoming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/17/elena-ferrante-lying-life-of-adults-review\">The Lying Life of Adults</a> (Europa Editions) tells of Giovanna, a teenage Neapolitan girl torn between two very different cities as she explores her sexuality and tries to construct an identity for herself.</p> <p>Our appetite for teenage stories shows no sign of abating. Netflix Italia has just announced plans to turn The Lying Life of Adults <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/12/netflix-to-adapt-elena-ferrantes-the-lying-life-of-adults\">into a series</a>, while the small-screen adaptation of Normal People has seen more than 16.2m viewing requests and delivered BBC Three\u2019s best ever week. As a novel, Normal People has been disparaged in some quarters as YA (young adult) fiction with pretensions, but regardless of whether you are a fan or not, its treatment of formative teenage experience and emotions as serious and worthy of attention is meaningful, unusual even. It\u2019s odd that this should feel exceptional, considering how the coming-of-age novel is such an established literary tradition, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/20/3\">Bonjour Tristesse</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/04/100-best-novels-no-85-the-bell-jar-sylvia-plath\">The Bell Jar</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/01/the-catcher-in-the-rye-fans-jd-salinger-holden-caulfield\">The Catcher in the Rye</a>.

The sexual experiences we have in those years are in many ways formative, but many of us write them off as clumsy and fumbling, minimising what they meant to us at the time \u2013 which was often everything. Our memories of our youth are potent and remain so throughout our lives. As the young journalist James Marriott <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/normal-people-speaks-to-the-young-person-in-all-of-us-2k3hzgjrb\">wrote recently</a>: \u201cLife touches us more closely when we\u2019re young \u2013 it\u2019s like missing a layer of skin. Experiences and feelings are painful and vivid in a way they never will be again as, agonisingly, we become ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>I think we are mean to our teenage selves because, on some level, we are embarrassed about how deeply we felt things at that age. Adulthood levels us out, makes us cynical, gives us distance from the things that hurt us. As a girl, particularly, you spend your adolescence discovering all the ways in which the world wants to hurt you, that your sexuality is not your own, that others feel a degree of ownership of your body to which they should not be entitled. For too many girls that discovery is painful, even traumatic. Bernadine Evaristo\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/08/girl-woman-other-by-bernardine-evaristo-review\">Girl, Woman, Other</a> is another brilliant recent novel that offers vivid insight into what it means to inhabit a teenage body, in this case a black teenage body that is forced to endure the horror of rape.</p> <p>There is a tendency to distance ourselves from the traumas of youth because we don\u2019t want these traumas to define us as adults. It\u2019s telling that it took Ernaux 60 years to tell the story of that sexual experience and the grey area she feels it occupies. The telling of it now has dovetailed with the #MeToo movement, of which she is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/06/annie-ernaux-interview-the-years-memoir-man-booker-international\">supportive</a>, which has seen many women reappraise their teenage years. Ernaux told the New York Times that \u201chad it been a rape, I might have been able to talk about it earlier, but I never thought about it in that way\u201d. Many women are only just finding \u2013 or inventing \u2013 the language they need to tell their stories.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/12/the-stakes-were-really-high-bringing-sally-rooney-normal-people-to-tv\">'The stakes were really high': the stars of Normal People on bringing Sally Rooney's novel to TV</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Watching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/01/portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire-review-celine-sciamma\">Portrait of a Lady on Fire</a> recently, which is directed by C\u00e9line Sciamma, another great chronicler of teenage femininity, I was struck by a scene in which two young women recreate an abortion, while a third \u2013 the artist \u2013 draws it (this is in late 18th-century France). It moved me greatly because of what it told the viewer about that which is undocumented. All those centuries of frightened women bleeding and cramping, and not one painting. When it comes to our cultural understanding of femininity, there are still many dark patches where there should be light.</p> <p>Both Ferrante and Ernaux are of a generation whose understanding of teenage sexuality was shaped by the repressed postwar period in which they came of age. As a reader, I was left with deep feelings of sadness and sympathy for the young women in their books. I felt their struggles so powerfully, and they were so well rendered, that the behaviour of these girls, which could easily be dismissed as \u201cteenage\u201d from the outside, made perfect, logical sense. Of course they felt that way. Perhaps the more we\u2019re exposed to teenage narratives that make such a persuasive case for their place in the arts, and that assert themselves as worthy of serious literary and cinematic inquiry, the more we will start to extend that sympathy to our own teenage selves and remember what it was like to feel everything so fiercely and so deeply.</p> <p>\u2022 Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>On 20 January, KK Shailaja phoned one of her medically trained deputies. She had read online about a dangerous new virus spreading in China. \u201cWill it come to us?\u201d she asked. \u201cDefinitely, Madam,\u201d he replied. And so the health minister of the Indian state of Kerala began her preparations.</p> <p>Four months later, Kerala has reported only 524 cases of Covid-19, four deaths and \u2013 according to Shailaja \u2013 no community transmission.

The names sit oddly with the merry, bespectacled former secondary school science teacher, but they reflect the widespread admiration she has drawn for demonstrating that effective disease containment is possible not only in a democracy, but in a poor one.</p> <p>How has this been achieved? Three days after reading about the new virus in China, and before Kerala had its first case of Covid-19, Shailaja held the first meeting of her rapid response team. The next day, 24 January, the team set up a control room and instructed the medical officers in Kerala\u2019s 14 districts to do the same at their level. By the time the first case arrived, on 27 January, via a plane from Wuhan, the state had already adopted the World Health Organization\u2019s protocol of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/21/kerala-indian-state-flattened-coronavirus-curve\">test, trace, isolate and support</a>.</p> <p>As the passengers filed off the Chinese flight, they had their temperatures checked. Three who were found to be running a fever were isolated in a nearby hospital. The remaining passengers were placed in home quarantine \u2013 sent there with information pamphlets about Covid-19 that had already been printed in the local language, Malayalam. The hospitalised patients tested positive for Covid-19, but the disease had been contained. \u201cThe first part was a victory,\u201d says Shailaja. \u201cBut the virus continued to spread beyond China and soon it was everywhere.\u201d</p> <p>In late February, encountering one of Shailaja\u2019s surveillance teams at the airport, a Malayali family returning from Venice was evasive about its travel history and went home without submitting to the now-standard controls. By the time medical personnel detected a case of Covid-19 and traced it back to them, their contacts were in the hundreds. Contact tracers tracked them all down, with the help of advertisements and social media, and they were placed in quarantine. Six developed Covid-19.</p> <p>Another cluster had been contained, but by now large numbers of overseas workers were heading home to Kerala from infected Gulf states, some of them carrying the virus. On 23 March, all flights into the state\u2019s four international airports were stopped. Two days later, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/overcome-by-anxiety-india-in-lockdown-many-can-ill-afford\">India entered a nationwide lockdown</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ea8c04da803bfbd3b862a94e307047c5b011ffa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ea8c04da803bfbd3b862a94e307047c5b011ffa/0_431_6468_3881/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kerala quarantine\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Indian citizens arriving from the Gulf states are bussed to a quarantine centre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arunchandra Bose/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the height of the virus in Kerala, 170,000 people were quarantined and placed under strict surveillance by visiting health workers, with those who lacked an inside bathroom housed in improvised isolation units at the state government\u2019s expense. That number has shrunk to 21,000. \u201cWe have also been accommodating and feeding 150,000 migrant workers from neighbouring states who were trapped here by the lockdown,\u201d she says. \u201cWe fed them properly \u2013 three meals a day for six weeks.\u201d Those workers are now being sent home on charter trains.</p> <p>Shailaja was already a celebrity of sorts in India before Covid-19. Last year, <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/virus-lesson-mollywood-tackle-coronavirus-200427110703824.html\">a movie called Virus</a> was released, inspired by her handling of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/18/nipah-fearsome-virus-that-caught-the-medical-and-scientific-world-off-guard\">an outbreak of an even </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/18/nipah-fearsome-virus-that-caught-the-medical-and-scientific-world-off-guard\">deadlier viral disease</a>, Nipah, in 2018. (She found the character who played her a little too worried-looking; in reality, <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/express-sunday-eye/extraordinary-measures-kk-shailaja-kerala-nipah-virus-5835834/\">she has said</a>, she couldn\u2019t afford to show fear.) She was praised not only for her proactive response, but also for visiting the village at the centre of the outbreak.</p> <p>The villagers were terrified and ready to flee, because they did not understand how the disease was spreading. \u201cI rushed there with my doctors, we organised a meeting in the panchayat [village council] office and I explained that there was no need to leave, because the virus could only spread through direct contact,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you kept at least a metre from a coughing person, it couldn\u2019t travel. When we explained that, they became calm \u2013 and stayed.\u201d</p> <p>Nipah prepared Shailaja for Covid-19, she says, because it taught her that a highly contagious disease for which there is no treatment or vaccine should be taken seriously. In a way, though, she had been preparing for both outbreaks all her life.</p> <p>The Communist Party of India (Marxist), of which she is a member, has been prominent in Kerala\u2019s governments since 1957, the year after her birth. (It was part of the Communist Party of India until 1964, when it broke away.) Born into a family of activists and freedom fighters \u2013 her grandmother campaigned against untouchability \u2013 she watched the so-called \u201cKerala model\u201d be assembled from the ground up; when we speak, this is what she wants to talk about. </p> <p>The foundations of the model are land reform \u2013 enacted via legislation that capped how much land a family could own and increased land ownership among tenant farmers \u2013 a decentralised public health system and investment in public education. Every village has a primary health centre and there are hospitals at each level of its administration, as well as 10 medical colleges.</p> <p>This is true of other states, too, says MP Cariappa, a public health expert based in Pune, Maharashtra state, but nowhere else are people so invested in their primary health system. Kerala enjoys <a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-aging-faster-than-rest-of-india-says-economic-review/story-SEw6hmK8lfTnlTBMmCkZNN.html\">the highest life expectancy</a> and <a href=\"https://thewire.in/health/india-infant-mortality-rate\">the lowest infant mortality</a> of any state in India; it is also <a href=\"https://kerala.gov.in/total-literacy\">the most literate</a> state. \u201cWith widespread access to education, there is a definite understanding of health being important to the wellbeing of people,\u201d says Cariappa.</p> <p>Shailaja says: \u201cI heard about those struggles \u2013 the agricultural movement and the freedom fight \u2013 from my grandma. She was a very good storyteller.\u201d Although emergency measures such as the lockdown are the preserve of the national government, each Indian state sets its own health policy. If the Kerala model had not been in place, she insists, her government\u2019s response to Covid-19 would not have been possible.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bbb89c19e6f28498b156dd5abecc44830ee725df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbb89c19e6f28498b156dd5abecc44830ee725df/0_256_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"test centre in ErnakulamKerala\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A walk-in test centre in Ernakulam, Kerala.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That said, the state\u2019s primary health centres had started to show signs of age. When Shailaja\u2019s party came to power in 2016, it undertook a modernisation programme. One pre-pandemic innovation was to create clinics and a registry for respiratory disease \u2013 a big problem in India. \u201cThat meant we could spot conversion to Covid-19 and look out for community transmission,\u201d Shailaja says. \u201cIt helped us very much.\u201d</p> <p>When the outbreak started, each district was asked to dedicate two hospitals to Covid-19, while each medical college set aside 500 beds. Separate entrances and exits were designated. Diagnostic tests were in short supply, especially after the disease reached wealthier western countries, so they were reserved for patients with symptoms and their close contacts, as well as for random sampling of asymptomatic people and those in the most exposed groups: health workers, police and volunteers.</p> <p>Shailaja says a test in Kerala produces a result within 48 hours. \u201cIn the Gulf, as in the US and UK \u2013 all technologically fit countries \u2013 they are having to wait seven days,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat is happening there?\u201d She doesn\u2019t want to judge, she says, but she has been mystified by the large death tolls in those countries: \u201cI think testing is very important \u2013 also quarantining and hospital surveillance \u2013 and people in those countries are not getting that.\u201d She knows, because Malayalis living in those countries have phoned her to say so.</p> <p>Places of worship were closed under the rules of lockdown, <a href=\"https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/pilgrims-protest-closure-of-bajjreshwari-devi-temple-57282\">resulting in protests in </a><a href=\"https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/pilgrims-protest-closure-of-bajjreshwari-devi-temple-57282\">some Indian states</a>, but resistance has been noticeably absent in Kerala \u2013 in part, perhaps, because its chief minister, Pinarayi Vijayan, consulted with local faith leaders about the closures. Shailaja says Kerala\u2019s high literacy level is another factor: \u201cPeople understand why they must stay at home. You can explain it to them.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/22/snapshots-of-a-world-in-lockdown-the-crisis-has-crossed-a-new-threshold\">Snapshots of a world in lockdown: 'The crisis has crossed a new threshold'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Indian government plans to lift the lockdown on 17 May (the date has been extended twice). After that, she predicts, there will be a huge influx of Malayalis to Kerala from the heavily infected Gulf region. \u201cIt will be a great challenge, but we are preparing for it,\u201d she says. There are plans A, B and C, with plan C \u2013 the worst-case scenario \u2013 involving the requisitioning of hotels, hostels and conference centres to provide 165,000 beds. If they need more than 5,000 ventilators, they will struggle \u2013 although more are on order \u2013 but the real limiting factor will be manpower, especially when it comes to contact tracing. \u201cWe are training up schoolteachers,\u201d Shailaja says.</p> <p>Once the second wave has passed \u2013 if, indeed, there is a second wave \u2013 these teachers will return to schools. She hopes to do the same, eventually, because her ministerial term will finish with the state elections a year from now. Since she does not think the threat of Covid-19 will subside any time soon, what secret would she like to pass on to her successor?

Pablo*, who was recruited from his home town in Africa, says he has always felt welcomed by local people. But in the factory, where he earns about \u20ac11.80 (\u00a310.40) an hour, life is hard. Workers feel intimidated and vulnerable, and are unable to stand up for their legal rights, he says. \u201cPeople are not being treated with dignity and respect.\u201d</p> <p>Pablo says that until a few weeks ago, apart from posting government notices about Covid-19 on the walls, his factory didn\u2019t put anything in place to protect its workers. \u201cThere was no checking of temperature, no masks, no 2-metre social distancing. When we asked for masks, they said no.\u201d He says he he doesn\u2019t feel safe at work, and is sure that he will get infected with the virus. \u201cNew workers are brought in to replace people who are out sick, but we don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve been screened.\u201d</p> <p>Because of their low pay, many migrant workers live in communal houses and some have to share bedrooms. \u201cThey don\u2019t feel safe, but they have to work,\u201d says Adriana*, a Polish worker at a meat factory in Northern Ireland. There are perspex screens in parts of the factory and workers\u2019 temperatures are now checked, but there is still no distancing inside the factory, and workers are afraid.</p> <p>Santos*, a Brazilian worker in a meat plant south of the border, says that many of his fellow workers have poor levels of English and aren\u2019t aware of their rights, such as welfare support if they are sick. \u201cIf these people have the virus, who will help them? How will they get food?\u201d</p> <p>Following his positive diagnosis for the virus, Marco is now recovering at home. He gets a weekly payment from the government, and he says his health is OK.

  "<p>People behaving badly is a staple of the news, and the pandemic has given us plenty of lurid snapshots. In the US alone, we have seen protesters with guns in Michigan\u2019s capital demanding an end to lockdown, anti-vaxxer women <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/us/anti-vaxxers-coronavirus-protests.html\" title=\"\">in a frenzy</a> at California\u2019s capitol, opportunists stockpiling hand sanitiser to resell for profit.</p> <p>One of the biggest cliches about disasters is that they reveal civilisation as a thin veneer, beneath which lies brutal human nature. From this perspective, the best we can hope for from most people under crisis is selfish indifference; at worst, they will swiftly turn to violence. Our worst instincts must be repressed. This becomes a justification for authoritarianism and heavy-handed policing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/audio/2020/jun/05/rebecca-solnit-mutual-aid-coronavirus-podcast\">'The way we get through this is together': the rise of mutual aid under coronavirus \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But studies of historical disasters have shown that this is not how most people actually behave. There are nearly always selfish and destructive people, and they are often in power, because we have created systems that reward that kind of personality and those principles. But the great majority of people in ordinary disasters behave in ways that are anything but selfish, and if we\u2019re stuck with veneer as a metaphor, then it peels off to reveal a lot of creative and generous altruism and brilliant grassroots organising. With the global pandemic, these empathic urges and actions are wider and deeper and more consequential than ever.</p> <p>A dozen years ago, the term \u201cmutual aid\u201d was, as far as I can tell, used mostly by anarchists and scholars. Somehow it has migrated into general usage in recent years and now, in the midst of the pandemic, it is everywhere. Mutual aid has generally meant aid offered in a spirit of solidarity and reciprocity, often coming from within struggling communities, empowering those aided, and with an eye towards liberation and social change. Generally it meant volunteer coalitions doing work such as rebuilding or food distribution or supporting resistance camps. One of the most striking aspects of this global crisis is how many forms of aid and solidarity there are. These new forms of generosity we are seeing \u2013 organising, networks, projects, donations, support and outreach \u2013 are numerous beyond counting, a superbloom of altruistic engagement.</p> <p>This work has been made more difficult by the great withdrawal \u2013 the empty schools, shops, streets and offices. And that withdrawal is itself altruism in action \u2013 a withdrawal carried out by billions for the benefit of their communities, as well as their own safety. In the initial phase, we withdrew from the spaces we share out of solidarity: we moved apart to come together. We intentionally produced, in the form of business and school shutdowns and staying home, an unprecedented economic calamity as an alternative to accepting mass death.</p> <p>In March, many small business owners and service workers in the US willingly shut down their enterprises, and thereby their livelihood, even before the official orders came. In April, 50 restaurant owners in the Atlanta area <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/02/us/georgia-restaurant-owners-closed-statement/index.html\" title=\"\">publicly rejected</a> the Georgia governor\u2019s invitation to reopen. Together they took out an ad in a local newspaper and wrote: \u201cWe agree that it\u2019s in the best interest of our employees, our guests, our community and our industry to keep our dining rooms closed at this time.\u201d</p> <p>For some, staying home may be a strain, but for others it means financial ruin. Sacrificing your own financial security for the common good was a solemn commitment that people made across the world. It was one of the things that made this crisis distinct: how often refraining, <em>not</em> doing, <em>not</em> going anywhere, <em>not</em> continuing activities, was also an act of public-spirited generosity. This is willing sacrifice for the public good. But people have been doing more than that.</p> <p>In March, the UK\u2019s National Health Service called for 250,000 volunteers to sign up to help seniors, people who were isolating and medical staff who needed deliveries. More than three times that many <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/13/a-million-volunteer-to-help-nhs-and-others-during-covid-19-lockdown\" title=\"\">signed up</a>. Appreciation for the NHS grew even stronger, and the widespread weekly rounds of applause for its workers became one of the welcome interruptions of isolation. In mid-March, a <a href=\"https://covidmutualaid.org/local-groups/\" title=\"\">website</a> was launched listing several hundred new mutual aid groups across the country, so people could search their local area.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dd8dfe81259bc34e6035325ba739104c9218a442\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd8dfe81259bc34e6035325ba739104c9218a442/0_293_4432_2661/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Volunteers from a mutual aid group in Islington, north London in April 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Volunteers from a mutual aid group in Islington, north London in April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Green/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIn my area in London, we have had so many [mutual aid groups] that we\u2019ve spun off down to street level,\u201d one Londoner told me. \u201cOur two-street collective has done shopping, picked up medicines, created an Easter-egg -in-the-window hunt for kids, all to help one another.\u201d Another wrote: \u201cHackney in London has all the usual stuff like grocery buying and support, plus people are sourcing donated phones for people in hospital, laptops for kids who need them to access home learning and cars for healthcare staff redeployed to the makeshift Covid-19 hospital.\u201d</p> <p>A few weeks ago, I heard someone complain that Lexington, Kentucky, had four mutual aid groups \u2013 they were concerned that so many volunteers would be redundant; I was awestruck by the abundance. In the course of writing this piece, I looked at various new mutual aid projects: meal deliveries to the elderly in Paterson, New Jersey; the Twin Cities Queer and Trans Mutual Aid group in Minneapolis-Saint Paul; projects to aid the Hopi, Zuni and Navajo on reservations in the US south-west; a Washington state project to support the undocumented; sex workers organising to raise emergency funds.</p> <p>I saw people stuck at home in isolation teach dance and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMVzRQ6hIb2YdSBUIUjSVKg\" title=\"\">drawing</a> classes, tell stories, play music online to encourage others quarantining in place; Italians singing together from their balconies and Iranians reciting poetry from theirs; a young native <a href=\"https://www.rgj.com/story/news/2020/04/23/coronavirus-impact-nevada-tribes-indigenous-people/5160591002/\" title=\"\">Nevadan going fishing</a> to feed members of her Pyramid Lake Paiute tribe. Most of us have seen, or performed, one-off acts of kindness \u2013 running an errand for a frail neighbour, chalking a cheerful message on the pavement, picking up the shopping bill for the struggling couple at the checkout, donating to a fundraiser for an acquaintance who has been laid off or taken ill. But such individual actions are not enough to address this triple catastrophe of a viral pandemic, a financial collapse and the emotional, educational and other consequences of the great withdrawal.</p> <p>Thus there are also people building organisations to provide broader, ongoing practical aid \u2013 such as the young people in more than a dozen US cities delivering groceries and supplies to older and immunocompromised people via a network called Zoomers to Boomers \u2013 and others organising emotional support for those who feel isolated, including the UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://nowthisnews.com/news/people-can-adopt-a-grandparent-to-combat-loneliness-during-coronavirus\" title=\"\">adopt-a-grandparent</a> programme. There are new groups, projects, organisations and networks, and old ones retooling for the crisis.</p> <p>Fiji-based climate organiser <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Thelma_Lutun\" title=\"\">Thelma Young-Lutunatabua</a> told me about the return of traditional Fijian forms of equitable, cooperative food distribution to make sure no one was left out. \u201cThe way we get through this is together,\u201d she said.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Fifteen years ago, in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, a mutual aid organisation called <a href=\"https://www.commongroundrelief.org/about-us/\" title=\"\">Common Ground</a> <a href=\"https://www.commongroundrelief.org/about-us/\" title=\"\">Relief</a> was founded by a handful of people inside the damaged area, including the former Black Panther Malik Rahim. (In the US, perhaps the most famous past examples of mutual aid are the Black Panther party\u2019s 1960s-era food programmes to assuage hunger in inner-city neighbourhoods.) The group\u2019s slogan was \u201csolidarity not charity\u201d, a phrase inspired by the Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano: \u201cI don\u2019t believe in charity. I believe in solidarity. Charity is so vertical. It goes from the top to the bottom. Solidarity is horizontal. It respects the other person. I have a lot to learn from other people.\u201d</p> <p>As a definition of mutual aid\u2019s ideals, \u201csolidarity not charity\u201d surfaces constantly today. Charity often implies that the afflicted population is powerless or incompetent to address its own needs. Sometimes, it can take away confidence and pride even as it gives tangible aid. Solidarity is, first of all, an affirmation that we are in this together, and mutual aid demonstrates that even in crisis we have strength and capacity to care for ourselves. The term comes from the anarchist philosopher Peter Kropotkin\u2019s 1902 book <a href=\"https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-mutual-aid-a-factor-of-evolution\" title=\"\">Mutual Aid:</a> <a href=\"https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-mutual-aid-a-factor-of-evolution\" title=\"\">a Factor of Evolution</a>, which argues that aiding and protecting others and serving the needs of the group rather than the individual has been essential to the survival of many species, and is evident in early and traditional human societies. </p> <p>In the time of coronavirus, mutual aid has been used to describe myriad new volunteer cooperative projects that have arisen in response to disaster. But the landscape of outreach is complex and varied. Take, for example, the creation and circulation of masks. There is a whole spectrum of mask economies from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/face-masks-coveted-commodity-coronavirus-pandemic\" title=\"\">corrupt profiteering</a> and outright theft \u2013 including by the US <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2010025\" title=\"\">federal government</a> \u2013 to the very different world of creative mutual aid. Many of us, myself included, have made a few masks for those we know. Others have gone into bulk production.</p> <p>San Francisco local government supervisor Matt Haney fundraised and organised <a href=\"https://abc7news.com/coronavirus-face-mask-san-francisco-free-sf-homeless/6116008/\" title=\"\">the distribution</a> of thousands of masks for the impoverished, densely housed \u2013 and houseless \u2013 residents of the city\u2019s Tenderloin district, which he represents. Adriana Camarena, a lawyer from Mexico City, realised that the undocumented day labourers near her home in San Francisco\u2019s Mission district had few supplies and little access to health information to meet the crisis. So <a href=\"http://eltecolote.org/content/en/arts_culture/mask-making-for-a-cause-how-two-bay-area-women-rose-to-meet-the-demand/\" title=\"\">she began</a> making and distributing cloth masks and hand sanitiser, and giving brief educational talks to go with them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e847a04b7295e246a06651db7fcfbca5443927a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e847a04b7295e246a06651db7fcfbca5443927a0/0_457_5000_2998/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A husband and wife making protective visors with 3D printers in their home garage in Calabasas, California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A husband and wife making protective visors with 3D printers in their home garage in Calabasas, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, the artist and art professor Stephanie Syjuco settled into mask mass production to meet the needs of people in Oakland and Berkeley, starting with masks for a group working to address food insecurity among UC Berkeley students. By late April, she had personally made 700 masks. And the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/2764362993676831/\" title=\"\">Auntie Sewing Squad</a>, founded by Los Angeles performance artist Kristina Wong, now includes more than 500 members, and has produced more than 20,000 masks, by Wong\u2019s count.</p> <p>The aunties (and uncles, but mostly aunties) began by making masks for hospital workers, and then for farmworkers, people released by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) or getting out of prison, immigrant communities and other vulnerable groups. It\u2019s a model of decentralised, volunteer-driven organising: whoever finds a need obtains pledges from makers until the required number is reached, and the beautifully made masks are gathered and shipped to their destination. Many pay for their own materials and shipping, and donations support others. This week, the squad is sending a van full of supplies, including masks, materials and three sewing machines, to the Navajo nation, which has been hard hit by the virus. The Navajo is just one of several indigenous communities they have reached out to.</p> <p>The Auntie Sewing Squad even expanded to include cooking to support those who sew. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve been bent over a sewing machine for 12 hours, a nice order of pad thai is really welcome,\u201d one auntie told me.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/26/last-iron-lung-paul-alexander-polio-coronavirus\">The man in the iron lung</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The US mask-makers, like donors to food-distribution programmes, are in part compensating for governmental failure. Had the federal government prepared for crisis, and supported the scientific advice on how to respond to pandemics, the need for these mutual aid efforts could have been smaller. There has been much talk of the underlying health conditions that make individuals more vulnerable to Covid-19. The US as a whole has underlying conditions \u2013 systemic racism, poverty and financial precariousness, lack of access to healthcare and the internet for rural and poor families \u2013 that have made this crisis far worse than it should have been. The old conservative argument against social programmes was that these needs should be met by individual and independent institutions\u2019 generosity. In unequal societies, these were never enough to meet the need.</p> <p>What is noteworthy for me about this crisis is that there is no clear distinction between purely volunteer- and donation-driven projects, and a host of other endeavours trying to meet the needs of the moment. There are many ways that businesses and workers are stepping up or shifting what they do and how they do it, out of altruism. A Buddhist group in Tallahassee, Florida, raised $500,000 to purchase masks from China for medical workers in their area. The jet belonging to the New England Patriots football team brought 1.2m masks directly from China to circumvent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/02/new-england-patriots-coronavirus-masks-plane\" title=\"\">the federal government\u2019s outbidding</a> of Massachusetts on personal protective equipment (PPE).</p> <p>Elsewhere, the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/us/politics/amish-coronavirus-ohio.html\" title=\"\">reported</a> on Amish families who, as other jobs dried up, turned to mass-producing cloth masks, face shields and other PPE for the Cleveland clinic, which urgently needed them. (This, like the California government program that lets otherwise shuttered restaurants deliver meals to isolated senior citizens, is when aid becomes literally mutual, meeting needs on both sides of the interaction.) Then there\u2019s the 43 Pennsylvania factory workers <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/04/23/factory-masks-coronavirus-ppe/\" title=\"\">who chose to isolate themselves</a> in their workplace for a 28-day marathon of 12-hour days, during which they produced tens of millions of pounds of polypropylene, the raw material from which a lot of PPE is made. Like the Amish, they were paid for their work, and were working in intense new ways, fuelled by social commitment, to meet an urgent need. One of the workers said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been getting messages on social media from nurses, doctors, emergency workers, saying thank you for what we\u2019re doing. But we want to thank them for what they did and are continuing to do. That\u2019s what made the time we were in there go by quickly, just being able to support them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ae31e92fac49f60e3dbb219ef29c2f4f64cb8331\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae31e92fac49f60e3dbb219ef29c2f4f64cb8331/0_207_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Volunteers at a food bank in San Francisco in March 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Volunteers at a food bank in San Francisco in March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Lam/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During the final 1,000 days of the second world war, shipyard workers in the San Francisco Bay Area produced 1,000 warships \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/wwIIbayarea/shipbuilding.htm\" title=\"\">a warship a day</a>. Something like that epic, urgent industry seems to be at work now, but outside the federal government, or any government. In early April, the Bay Area branch of the news site Hoodline <a href=\"https://hoodline.com/2020/04/inside-bay-area-makers-rush-to-solve-the-ppe-shortage?fbclid=IwAR3N3KQoePAXkPrTFAOtQsaJhLGnRA2_g1MLb2A9caidTLgnXgwlvXLEKlY\" title=\"\">reported</a>: \u201cOn Thursday morning, two tons of rolled sheet plastic arrived at a warehouse in Alameda. By the end of the weekend, it had become 16,000 plastic face shields. That remarkable turnaround is entirely owed to self-organisation by Bay Area makers, who have transformed maker spaces, universities, fabrication shops and almost anyone with their own sewing machine, CNC machine or 3D printer into an ad-hoc corps of medical supply manufacturers.\u201d The report called the self-organised effort involving industrial-design students and teachers a \u201cdistributed factory\u201d. Such decentralised efforts, organised without top-down authority, are exemplary mutual aid.</p> <p>In April, 14 nurses and seven doctors from the same institution <a href=\"https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/04/417236/ucsf-health-care-workers-serve-navajo-nation\" title=\"\">set off</a> for a one-month assignment on the Navajo reservation, whose residents are facing high levels of infection. They were coordinated by the existing UCSF <a href=\"https://healinitiative.org/\" title=\"\">Heal Initiative</a> (Health, Equity, Action and Leadership), which works with impoverished and vulnerable communities from Haiti to Nepal. Its mission statement is: \u201cWe seek to embody solidarity and contribute to the movement for global health equity led by communities themselves.\u201d This initiative, based on the principle of \u201csolidarity not charity\u201d, has been working with communities under stress for six years, and will still be there when the immediate crisis is over.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>During \u201cordinary\u201d disasters \u2013 a hurricane, an earthquake \u2013 there\u2019s a phenomenon called volunteer convergence, whereby people eager to help gather in the impacted areas. Sometimes so many people and so much donated material shows up that they pose management problems for those at the centre of the crisis. This is not an ordinary disaster \u2013 the impacted area is all over the world, and convergence is banned \u2013 but people are showing up in many ways. Some of this work is always going on \u2013 there is always suffering and injustice to assuage, and there are always people trying to do so.</p> <p>Even ordinary disasters never really end. There are many ways in which Hurricane Katrina\u2019s impact on New Orleans and other parts of the gulf coast lasted \u2013 though there are, at least, some positive aspects to this lingering impact. The <a href=\"http://www.cghc.org/\" title=\"\">Common Ground</a> <a href=\"http://www.cghc.org/\" title=\"\">Health Clinic</a> spun off from Common Ground Relief. Fifteen years on, it\u2019s still delivering free medical care in the New Orleans region.</p> <p>The Covid-19 pandemic and economic crisis will not end \u2013 if ending means things going back to the way they were. Whatever \u201cnormal\u201d meant on 1 January 2020, it will never return, and neither will millions of the jobs financed by the disposable income that has just dried up. It\u2019s worth remembering that, in the past few decades, the return to 19th-century robber-baron capitalism \u2013 via the dismantling of social safety nets, and the transformation of education, healthcare and other basic human needs into for-profit schemes that served shareholders first \u2013 meant that everyday life had already become a disaster for too many billions of people before this crisis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ec5af3cc8ef5c2f8fdfb2ea0a614446108f2f514\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec5af3cc8ef5c2f8fdfb2ea0a614446108f2f514/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mutual aid group fliers being posted in London in March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mutual aid group fliers being posted in London in March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Perugia/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a long, rough road ahead. Without radical change, the way food, shelter, medical care and education are produced and distributed will be more unfair and more devastating than before. It seems likely that conservatives will argue for brutal austerity and libertarian abandonment of the most desperate, while the rest of us are going to have to argue for some form of post-capitalism that decouples meeting basic needs from wage labour \u2013 perhaps the kind of basic income that <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-spain-economy/spain-to-pay-basic-income-to-help-poorest-weather-coronavirus-idUSKBN21Z18X\" title=\"\">Spain is planning</a> to introduce.</p> <p>The devastating economic effect of the pandemic will make innovation essential, whether it is rethinking higher education or food distribution, or how to fund news media. The Green New Deal offers a model for how to move forward on jobs and leave fossil fuels behind as that sector founders and climate catastrophe looms. Protests in many fields \u2013 including nurses demanding PPE, and warehouse, delivery and food-service workers protesting against exploitative or unsafe working conditions \u2013 suggests that workers\u2019 organisations may be gaining strength.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>I believe the generosity and solidarity in action in the present moment offers a foreshadowing of what is possible \u2013 and necessary. The basic generosity and empathy of most ordinary people should be regarded as a treasure, a light and an energy source that can drive a better society, if it is recognised and encouraged. Mostly, it\u2019s overlooked, undermined and sabotaged. Capitalism, and its octopus arms of entertainment, advertising and marketing, endeavour to reduce us to consumers. This means making us the kind of miserable, selfish, lonely people who seek fulfllment through buying stuff, and believe in competitiveness as a basic social force. Competitiveness, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/aug/18/neoliberalism-the-idea-that-changed-the-world\" title=\"\">driving word</a> behind free-market ideology, means we are rivals and there is scarcity; each of us gets more by seeing that someone else gets less.</p> <p>Competition is the antithesis of mutual aid, which is not only a practical tool but an ideological insurrection. The fact that even in places like the US, where these competitive, isolating messages have bombarded us for at least 150 years, millions still reach out in generosity, and are still moved to meet the needs that become visible in moments such as this, is testament to something about human nature and human possibility. Those urges are strong and deep, and they can be a foundation for something different. Indeed, they often have been before, when European social welfare was built up, when US social safety nets were created, and when people self-organised on smaller scales to take care of each other.</p> <p>Some of that sense of urgency and shared destiny will fade away, as it often does after a disaster, but one of the important things to remember is that some of it was here before this pandemic. I sometimes think that capitalism is a catastrophe constantly being mitigated and cleaned up by mutual aid and kinship networks, by the generosity of religious and secular organisations, by the toil of human-rights lawyers and climate groups, and by the kindness of strangers. Imagine if these forces, this spirit, weren\u2019t just the cleanup crew, but were the ones setting the agenda.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/what-coronavirus-can-teach-us-about-hope-rebecca-solnit\">'The impossible has already happened': what coronavirus can teach us about hope</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What I have seen after earlier disasters is that a lot of people aspire to \u201cgo home\u201d and \u201cback to normal\u201d, but some find in the moment a sense of self and a sense of connection so meaningful that something about who they were and what they did in the crisis carries forward into how they live the rest of their life. Sometimes this is as intangible as a change of priorities and habits, and a new sense of agency; not uncommonly, it\u2019s as substantial as a new coalition, a new network, a new set of policy priorities, a new political career or a decision to go into work that supports the whole. And even those who want things to get back to normal often find they are changed permanently in their sense of who they are, and what matters most.</p> <p>The pandemic marks the end of an era and the beginning of another \u2013 one whose harshness must be mitigated by a spirit of generosity. An artist hunched over her sewing machine, a young person delivering groceries on his bicycle, a nurse suiting up for the ICU, a doctor heading to the Navajo nation, a graduate student hip-deep in Pyramid Lake catching trout for elders, a programmer setting up a website to organise a community: the work is under way.

However, it is not yet clear whether they have a lower chance of catching Covid-19. Although fewer children have been picked up in national testing programs, this could be due to fewer being tested. During the early phase of the epidemic in Europe, adult travelers played a dominant role in seeding infections, which also meant, purely for circumstantial reasons, that children would have played a less significant role in spreading infections.</p> \n  <p>Studies on this question give a mixed picture. One analysis, in <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30287-5/fulltext\">the Lancet Infectious Diseases</a>, of households with confirmed Covid-19 in Shenzhen, China, found that children younger than 10 were just as likely as adults to get infected. However, there is other evidence from South Korea, Italy and Iceland suggesting lower infection rates among children. Some of the difference could also be down to differences in social mixing.</p> \n  <p><strong>Why do children react differently to adults?</strong></p> \n  <p>For many infectious diseases, there is a U-shaped risk curve, with the youngest and oldest in society being most vulnerable. Covid-19 does not follow this pattern \u2013 even toddlers and newborn babies typically only experience mild symptoms. One theory is that children\u2019s lungs might contain fewer of the ACE2 receptors that the virus uses to enter cells. To confirm this, researchers would need to study tissue samples from children. Another possibility is that children\u2019s immune systems respond in a more optimal way to the virus \u2013 mounting a strong enough response to get rid of the infection, but without going into overdrive and flooding the body with inflammatory proteins, which are known to sometimes cause problems in adult patients.</p> \n  <p><strong>Are children invisible transmitters?</strong><br></p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-most-infections-spread-by-people-yet-to-show-symptoms-scientists\">Asymptomatic transmission</a> is known to play an important role in the spread of Covid-19 \u2013 studies have shown that in general people appear to be at their most infectious in the day or so before symptoms start. This raises the question of whether children are silent spreaders of the virus. A recent German study, which compared the viral load of nearly 4,000 people aged from one to 100 years old, added weight to this idea. It found that regardless of age, people appeared to shed a similar level of virus, suggesting they could be equally infectious. However, a caveat is that the study did not measure real-life transmission in children. As schools reopen and community transmission is tracked closely in some European countries, a clearer answer on this is likely to emerge in the coming months.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/are-children-less-susceptible-to-coronavirus\">Are children less susceptible to coronavirus?</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T22:43:59.956Z\">at 11.43pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebc678c8f080c727453a747\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T21:37:16.561Z\">10.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Per White House press pool reporters, the president also called Dr Anthony Fauci\u2019s message yesterday cautioning against opening schools too soon \u201cunacceptable\u201d. </strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cI was surprised by his answer,\u201d Trump said. \u201cTo me it\u2019s not an acceptable answer especially when it comes to schools.\u201d<br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Yamiche/status/1260685470909988864\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Pres Trump: The \"only thing\" that would be acceptable is teachers staying home a bit longer bc the coronavirus \"attacks age.\"<br><br>Dr. Fauci yesterday: \"I think we better be careful if we are not cavalier in thinking that children are completely immune to the deleterious effects.\"</p>\u2014 Yamiche Alcindor (@Yamiche) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Yamiche/status/1260685470909988864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 13, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Yesterday, the top public health official contradicted Trump, who urged schools and businesses to reopen and said the White House has set a target of having 100m vaccine doses by the autumn.

The measure also established prioritized criteria for the demographer to follow, making partisan fairness and competitiveness one of the most important ones. The reform would likely weaken Republican control of the state legislature, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/c49a2cf375894f539ca4aad5aafc6a74\">an Associated Press analysis</a> found.</p> \n  <p>The next round of redistricting won\u2019t take place until 2021, and the demographer hasn\u2019t even been chosen yet. But if voters <a href=\"https://www.senate.mo.gov/20info/BTS_Web/Bill.aspx?SessionType=R&amp;BillID=26838179\">approve</a> the new Republican proposal, they would eliminate the position entirely and return redistricting power to committees picked by the state Democratic and Republican parties and the governor. It makes partisan fairness and competitiveness the least important criteria to follow when redistricting, instead prioritizing keeping districts compact and contiguous.</p> \n  <p>The U.S. constitution requires districts to have roughly the same number of people in each district and states have long used the all residents as the basis for drawing districts. But the Republican proposal requires districts to be drawn on the basis of \u201cone person, one vote,\u201d a change many believe would allow districts to be drawn solely on the population eligible to vote.

This guy, Fauci, may be even more off-base than your average epidemiologist.\u201d </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"cde94e03-8944-495c-8a0d-dc41e6593605\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TsRmIhTJ5YM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T18:19:53.738Z\">at 7.19pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebbe9bb8f08d99d46a16143\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T13:20:14.979Z\">2.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <h2>More from the key report on CDC gulf with White House</h2> \n  <p>From the start, CDC staffers working on the guidance were uncomfortable tying it specifically to reopening, and voiced their objections to the White House officials tasked with approving the guidance for release, according to a CDC official granted anonymity because they were not cleared to speak with the press, the AP reports.</p> \n  <p>The CDC\u2019s detailed guidance was eventually shelved by the administration April 30, according to internal government emails and CDC sources who were granted anonymity because they were not cleared to speak to the press.</p> \n  <p>After the AP reported about the burying of the guidance last week, the White House asked the CDC to revive parts of it, which were sent back for approval, according to emails and interviews.</p> \n  <p>On Tuesday, CDC Director Robert Redfield testified before a US Senate committee that the recommendations would be released \u201csoon.\u201d He provided no further details.
