  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2><strong>Global death toll passes 280,000</strong></h2> <p>The total number of fatalities from Covid-19 stands at 282,495, <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">according to the Johns Hopkins University coronavirus resource center</a>. Globally, 4,091,297 cases have been confirmed.</p> <h2>\u2018This is not the time to end the lockdown,\u2019 says Boris Johnson</h2> <p>In a speech criticised by some as confusing, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/10/boris-johnson-coronavirus-lockdown-shops-schools-june-reopening\">UK prime minister said</a> some schools in England and some shops might be able to open next month, and the government was \u201cactively encouraging\u201d people to return to work if they cannot do so from home. Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-lockdown-what-has-boris-johnson-announced\">urged workers to avoid public transport</a>, and said restaurants and cafes should not expect to open until at least July.</p> <h2><strong>South Africa passes 10,000 confirmed cases</strong></h2> <p>The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in South Africa stands at 10,015, including 194 fatalities, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/10/coronavirus-live-news-obama-trumps-covid-19--chaotic-as-global-cases-pass-4-million-mexico-russia-germany-south-korea-deaths-?page=with:block-5eb86f458f08464cd4297ad8#block-5eb86f458f08464cd4297ad8\">health minister Zwelini Mkhize has announced</a>. 84% of new cases were in Western Cape and Eastern Cape, and eight new deaths had been recorded.</p> <h2><strong>Leading Latin American airline files for bankruptcy</strong></h2> <p>Avianca Holdings, Latin America\u2019s second biggest airline and one of the oldest in the world, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/10/coronavirus-live-news-obama-trumps-covid-19--chaotic-as-global-cases-pass-4-million-mexico-russia-germany-south-korea-deaths-?page=with:block-5eb85bc68f0858b1a8107873#block-5eb85bc68f0858b1a8107873\">filed for bankruptcy</a>, after failing to secure aid from Colombia\u2019s government and with a bond payment deadline looming. If it fails to come out of bankruptcy, Avianca would be one of the first major carriers worldwide to go under as a result of the pandemic, which has caused a 90% decline in global air travel.</p> <h2>Poland must declare new election date within 14 days</h2> <p>The head of Poland\u2019s electoral commission has said the speaker of parliament has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/10/coronavirus-live-news-obama-trumps-covid-19--chaotic-as-global-cases-pass-4-million-mexico-russia-germany-south-korea-deaths-?page=with:block-5eb854a48f08c0a2409bb32e#block-5eb854a48f08c0a2409bb32e\">14 days to declare the date of a new presidential election</a>. The country had been due to hold a presidential election on Sunday and, while the vote was not officially cancelled or postponed, the electoral commission had said on Thursday it could not be held due to the coronavirus crisis.</p> <h2><strong>France exempt from UK\u2019s quarantine restrictions</strong></h2> <p>The British and French governments have released a joint statement saying that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/10/coronavirus-live-news-obama-trumps-covid-19--chaotic-as-global-cases-pass-4-million-mexico-russia-germany-south-korea-deaths-?page=with:block-5eb84c018f08c0a2409bb2f9#block-5eb84c018f08c0a2409bb2f9\">French will be exempt from the UK\u2019s proposed quarantine restrictions</a> following a call between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris-johnson\">Boris Johnson</a> and the French president, Emmanuel Macron. The statement stresses \u201cthe need for close bilateral, European and international cooperation in the fight against Covid-19\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>France reports lowest daily death toll since lockdown</strong></h2> <p>France reported 70 more coronavirus deaths on Sunday, its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/10/coronavirus-live-news-obama-trumps-covid-19--chaotic-as-global-cases-pass-4-million-mexico-russia-germany-south-korea-deaths-?page=with:block-5eb8441c8f08464cd42979d7#block-5eb8441c8f08464cd42979d7\">lowest daily toll since the lockdown began on 17 March</a>, as it prepared to ease restrictions. The new deaths brought the total toll in hospitals and nursing homes from the pandemic in France to 26,380, the health ministry said.</p> <h2><strong>WHO suspends activity in Yemen\u2019s Houthi-held areas</strong></h2> <p>The World Health Organization has suspended staff activity at its hubs in Houthi-held areas of Yemen in a move sources said was aimed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/10/coronavirus-live-news-obama-trumps-covid-19--chaotic-as-global-cases-pass-4-million-mexico-russia-germany-south-korea-deaths-?page=with:block-5eb839e58f08c0a2409bb286#block-5eb839e58f08c0a2409bb286\">pressure the group into being more transparent about suspected coronavirus cases</a>. The Houthis have reported just two cases, compared with the government\u2019s figure of 34. The war-torn country is split between a Saudi-backed government temporarily based in the south and the Houthi movement that ousted it from power in the capital, Sanaa, in the north in late 2014.</p>",

Instead of a road map, Johnson gave the nation a \u201csketch of a roadmap\u201d. Instead of a way ahead, he provided only a \u201csense of a way ahead\u201d. Instead of strong government leadership, the onus was on individuals to do the right thing and experts to provide the necessary data and technology.</p> \n  <p>The UK will be changed by this experience, the prime minister told us, but he provided no vision of the future, merely a list of comparative adjectives \u2013 stronger, better, more resilient, more innovative, more economically dynamic, more generous, more sharing.</p> \n  <p>Many of these ambitions could imply action on the longer-term problems facing the country and the world, such as the climate crisis. Or they could mean nothing at all. There were no details of anything new and positive that could emerge from the colossal suffering of the pandemic as the NHS and United Nations emerged from the ruins of the second world war. There was no mention either of a green new deal, which other nations plan to use as a vehicle for economic recovery. Nor were there details of how air quality improvements could be maintained, though many city mayors in the UK are already working on this.</p> \n  <p>Johnson encouraged more cycling, walking and a continuation of working from home, but when that was not possible, he urged people to drive rather than to use public transport. This is sensible given the need for physical distancing on trains and buses, but it added to the overall impression of a prime minister reacting to necessity rather than getting ahead of problems, pre-empting risks and forging a path illuminated by the \u201clight of science\u201d.</p> \n  <p>There should be more details about the future direction of the economy in the coming days, when Johnson addresses parliament, or when the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, unveils stimulus plans. If the prime minister is serious about the nation returning to \u201crobust health\u201d, the science is clear that climate, nature and air quality must be part of the recovery.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-10T20:28:01.620Z\">at 9.28pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb860498f08c0a2409bb384\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-10T20:17:02.565Z\">9.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">PM's message telling workers to return to factories is 'recipe for chaos', says TUC</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Frances O\u2019Grady,</strong> the TUC general secretary, has described Boris Johnson\u2019s speech as \u201ca recipe for chaos\u201d because safety measures for a return to work are not in place.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FrancesOGrady/status/1259551752443002880\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Lots of working people will feel confused and anxious after listening to Boris Johnson.<br> <br>Govt still hasn\u2019t published guidance on how workers will be kept safe.

This was the second time he\u2019s done it during this crisis. But tonight\u2019s event had an unhappy prequel, with No 10 having to damp down expectations created by newspaper headlines suggesting he would be promising lockdown \u201cfreedom\u201d, and he was further constrained tonight by the fact that much of the detail of what he is planning won\u2019t come until he presents his document to parliament tomorrow.</p> \n  <p>Still, it was a major speech. Here is a five-point analysis.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson offered a highly-conditional timetable for moving out of the most stringent aspects of lockdown while also stressing that most current restrictions need to remain in place</strong>. In terms of announcements that were genuinely new (in the sense that they had not been widely pre-briefed), what was most significant was what he said about what might happen in June and July. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In step two \u2013 at the earliest by June 1 \u2013 after half term \u2013 we believe we may be in a position to begin the phased reopening of shops and to get primary pupils back into schools, in stages, beginning with reception, Year 1 and Year 6.</p> \n   <p>Our ambition is that secondary pupils facing exams next year will get at least some time with their teachers before the holidays. And we will shortly be setting out detailed guidance on how to make it work in schools and shops and on transport.</p> \n   <p>And step three - at the earliest by July - and subject to all these conditions and further scientific advice; if and only if the numbers support it, we will hope to re-open at least some of the hospitality industry and other public places, provided they are safe and enforce social distancing.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But Johnson also stressed that these dates were \u201cdependent on a series of big ifs\u201d and, compared to other lockdown plans, this timetable was remarkably cursory. The Irish government, for example, has published a<a href=\"https://www.gov.ie/en/news/58bc8b-taoiseach-announces-roadmap-for-reopening-society-and-business-and-u/\"> \u201croadmap for reopening society and business\u201d</a> that proposes a five-phase easing of restrictions, with specific measures planned of five specific dates going up to 10 August. According to <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/coronavirus-lockdown-to-last-three-more-weeks-62z2brv36\">a report in the Times last week (paywall)</a>, Johnson was under pressure from \u201cdatists\u201d in cabinet to give dates for when certain measures would be relaxed. On the basis of this speech, the \u201cdatists\u201d secured only to the bare minimum.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson has actually toughened the lockdown much more than he has eased it.</strong> The most significant change to the status quo came when he confirmed reports that people arriving in the UK by air will be subject to quarantine. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-to-announce-covid-19-alert-system?page=with:block-5eb844428f0858b1a81077d5#block-5eb844428f0858b1a81077d5\"> 7.14pm.)</a> That is a remarkable shift, particularly for someone who gave a speech earlier this year saying he wanted to resist pressure for barriers to go up. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-to-announce-covid-19-alert-system?page=with:block-5eb825b88f08c0a2409bb1ed#block-5eb825b88f08c0a2409bb1ed\">6.30pm.) </a>Johnson also said that he would increase the fines for the small number of people who break social distancing rules. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-to-announce-covid-19-alert-system?page=with:block-5eb843788f08c0a2409bb2c4#block-5eb843788f08c0a2409bb2c4\">7.11pm.)</a> This will be an England-only measure, and it appears to go against the advice of the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. As was revealed this afternoon (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-to-announce-covid-19-alert-system?page=with:block-5eb81fc28f0858b1a81076e3#block-5eb81fc28f0858b1a81076e3\">4.56pm)</a>, in response to a proposal in April for greater penalties on lockdown offenders, Sage said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Any flat rate financial penalty will have a higher impact on poorer households.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The \u201ccareful\u201d steps to ease the lockdown this week announced as new measures in practice amounted to little more than saying that sunbathing is allowed, in England. </strong>Johnson said two things would be happening this week. First, people would be encouraged to go to work if they cannot work from home. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We said that you should work from home if you can, and only go to work if you must. We now need to stress that anyone who can\u2019t work from home, for instance those in construction or manufacturing, should be actively encouraged to go to work.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But for most of the last seven weeks the government\u2019s line has been that people should go to work if they can\u2019t work from home. When the government first announced the lockdown it put out guidance saying \u201call non-essential premises must now close\u201d, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/25/uk-coronavirus-live-news-covid-19-pmqs-boris-johnson-parliament-to-close-early-for-easter-recess?page=with:block-5e7b2d368f0878a2a48a9c24#block-5e7b2d368f0878a2a48a9c24\">this line was swiftly removed from the document</a> because it was not the message the government wanted to give out. And ministers infuriated Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, by refusing to back his call for all construction work to halt.</p> \n  <p>Second, Johnson said that from Wednesday people would be able to take more exercise. Referring to England, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>And from this Wednesday, we want to encourage people to take more and even unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise.</p> \n   <p>You can sit in the sun in your local park, you can drive to other destinations, you can even play sports but only with members of your own household.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But, unlike in Scotland and Wales, in England the lockdown restrictions never said that people could only go out once a day for exercise (even though ministers sometimes said people should exercise just once a day). And<a href=\"https://www.college.police.uk/What-we-do/COVID-19/Documents/What-constitutes-a-reasonable-excuse.pdf\"> official police guidance (pdf)</a> said people could drive to another destination to exercise. All that really seems to be new is that people can sunbath (not something that previously seemed to count as a \u201creasonable excuse\u201d to be out under the regulations).</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson announce a new five-step covid alert system that will be used to help decide when lockdown measures can be lifted.</strong> (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-to-announce-covid-19-alert-system?page=with:block-5eb8428b8f08c0a2409bb2bf#block-5eb8428b8f08c0a2409bb2bf\">7.07pm.)</a> This seems very similar to an approach announced by Cyril Ramaphosa, the South African president, <a href=\"https://sacoronavirus.co.za/2020/04/23/statement-by-president-cyril-ramaphosa-on-south-africas-response-to-the-coronavirus-pandemic-union-buildings-tshwane/\">in a speech last month.</a> Here is the South African system.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34859ebafb21d0757953e05469b99aa5b649e1db\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34859ebafb21d0757953e05469b99aa5b649e1db/0_0_1498_1230/1000.jpg\" alt=\"South Africa\u2019s coronavirus alert system - similar to the one announced by Boris Johnson tonight\" width=\"1000\" height=\"821\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">South Africa\u2019s coronavirus alert system - similar to the one announced by Boris Johnson tonight</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: South African government</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>But Johnson did not explain which lockdown measures will apply for which alert level. (Perhaps there will be more detail in the document being published tomorrow.) He also said changes to the alert level will be triggered primarily by changes to R, the reproduction number (which shows the coronavirus infectivity rate).

Over the last three months (like most politicians, and even many scientists), he has had to drastically revise his assessment of the threat it poses and what needs to be done. </p> \n  <p>Here are nine quotes that show how much his stance has changed.</p> \n  <p><strong>1 Johnson says he won\u2019t let coronavirus push him towards protectionism.</strong> One of his first public references to coronavirus came in a speech devoted to Britain\u2019s post-Brexit future <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-speech-in-greenwich-3-february-2020\">at Greenwich on 3 February</a>, when he said he would not let coronavirus push him towards protectionism.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>And in that context, we are starting to hear some bizarre autarkic rhetoric, when barriers are going up, and when there is a risk that new diseases such as coronavirus will trigger a panic and a desire for market segregation that go beyond what is medically rational to the point of doing real and unnecessary economic damage, then at that moment humanity needs some government somewhere that is willing at least to make the case powerfully for freedom of exchange, some country ready to take off its Clark Kent spectacles and leap into the phone booth and emerge with its cloak flowing as the supercharged champion, of the right of the populations of the earth to buy and sell freely among each other.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is somewhat hard to square with the news that Johnson is now planning to impose quarantine on new arrivals to the UK, although this is a public health policy, not a trade policy.</p> \n  <p><strong>2 Johnson avoids being alarmist as he publishes the government\u2019s first coronavirus action plan.</strong> The document was published on 3 March, when Johnson attended a press conference with Sir Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/03/labour-facing-one-of-worst-local-election-performances-in-recent-history-leaked-party-report-suggests-live-news?page=with:block-5e5e51bc8f086a28115b6b7b#block-5e5e51bc8f086a28115b6b7b\">Johnson stressed that most people had no need to fear the illness.</a> He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Let me be absolutely clear that for the overwhelming majority of people who contract the virus this will be a mild disease from which they will speedily and fully recover as we have already seen.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>3 Johnson calls for a balanced approach.</strong> Two days later, on 5 March, Johnson told ITV\u2019s This Morning that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/05/chief-medical-officer-chris-whitty-questioned-by-mps-live-news?page=with:block-5e60df108f08c2df6d273b17#block-5e60df108f08c2df6d273b17\">at that point it should be \u201cbusiness as usual for the overwhelming majority of people in this country\u201d.</a> He also said the government was going for a \u201cbalanced\u201d approach. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>One of the theories is perhaps you could take it in on the chin, take it all in one go and allow the disease to move through the population without really taking as many draconian measures. I think we need to strike a balance.</p> \n   <p>I think it would be better if we take all the measures that we can now just to stop the peak of the disease being as difficult for the NHS as it might. I think there are things we may be able to do.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In fact no one in the UK was saying the government should just \u201ctake it on the chin\u201d, but at that point government advisers were telling ministers that if they tried to suppress coronavirus completely, they would just risk a worse second peak later in the herd. A more balanced approach would allow \u201cherd immunity\u201d to develop, they argued.</p> \n  <p><strong>4 Johnson changes tone, and warns that \u201cmany more\u201d people will die.</strong><em> </em>At another Downing Street press conference, on 12 March, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/12/trumps-travel-ban-wont-have-much-impact-on-spread-of-coronavirus-says-rishi-sunak-live-news?page=with:block-5e6a75f18f085f0b8d947630#block-5e6a75f18f085f0b8d947630\">he said:</a></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I must level with you, I must level with the British public: many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This was also the moment when Johnson said<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/12/trumps-travel-ban-wont-have-much-impact-on-spread-of-coronavirus-says-rishi-sunak-live-news?page=with:block-5e6a75358f087df56e4c7796#block-5e6a75358f087df56e4c7796\"> the government was no longer trying to \u201ccontain\u201d coronavirus</a> and had instead moved to the stage where it was focusing on \u201cdelay\u201d.</p> \n  <p><strong>5 Johnson tells people to stay at home if possible.</strong> With the crisis intensifying, at the first of what No 10 said would be daily press conferences, Johnson announced on 16 March what amounted to a soft lockdown. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/16/boris-johnson-press-conference-coronavirus-live-firms-could-soon-be-allowed-to-run-reduced-services-because-of-coronavirus-shapps-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-5e6fb2518f085e564ad852d1#block-5e6fb2518f085e564ad852d1\">He said:</a></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We need people to start working from home where they possibly can. And you should avoid pubs, clubs, theatres and other such social venues.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>6 A week later Johnson announces the full lockdown.</strong><em> </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/boris-johnson-orders-uk-lockdown-to-be-enforced-by-police\">In an evening TV address on 23 March</a> he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>You should not be meeting friends. If your friends ask you to meet, you should say no. You should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home. You should not be going shopping except for essentials like food and medicine \u2013 and you should do this as little as you can.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>7 Johnson himself then went down with coronavirus, and he ended up in hospital, where he spent three nights in intensive care.</strong> On leaving hospital he recorded <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2020-04-12/coronavirus-prime-minister-boris-johnson-s-easter-sunday-message-in-full/\">an Easter Sunday message</a> (the resurrection video) in which he movingly described how he had come close to death, thanked the nurses who had looked after him, and paid tribute to the contribution of the public. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are making progress in this national battle because the British public formed a human shield around this country\u2019s greatest national asset - our National Health Service.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>8 On 27 April, on his first day back at work in Downing Street after his recuperation, Johnson says that preparations to ease the lockdown have been under way for weeks, but that the government will proceed cautiously.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/27/uk-coronavirus-live-news-boris-johnson-back-at-work-amid-talk-of-easing-lockdown?page=with:block-5ea696548f08fa2bdcb1bff2#block-5ea696548f08fa2bdcb1bff2\">He said: </a></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This is the moment when we have begun together to wrestle [coronavirus] to the floor, and so it follows that this is the moment of opportunity.

It is a meeting note, dated 1 April, prepared for a Sage meeting on 2 April.</p> \n  <p>The newly released material is everything from point 3, starting with the headline: \u201cSpecific comments about new suggestions for improving adherence within the Framework (27 March)\u201d. It shows Sage rejected three proposals to toughen the lockdown.</p> \n  <p>Here is the key extract.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The framework proposes four new suggestions for increasing adherence, numbered as options 17 to 20 that SPI-B have not commented on before. These focus on: 17) increasing the financial penalties imposed; 18) introducing self-validation for movements; 19) reducing exercise and/or shopping; 20) reducing non-home working. We have reservations about options 17 to 19. </p> \n   <p>First, we are unclear what the evidence base is that the targeted behaviours are a substantial contribution to disease transmission, particularly given the high adherence rates currently observed in the community. Is there evidence, for example, that exercise conducted more than 1km away from the house leads to higher rates of transmission than exercise conducted within 1km of the house? Indeed, for this option, there is a risk that reducing the ability of people to apply some flexibility in choosing where to exercise will increase risk by preventing people from spreading out in nearby open space. Tightening restrictions without clear epidemiological need may lose support among people who have been attempting to adhere.</p> \n   <p>Second, the implicit assumption underlying options 17 to 19 is that people lack motivation to adhere to current guidance. This may apply to some specific subgroups (the example of young men has been given), but broadly the current levels of adherence we are witnessing suggest this is not the issue. </p> \n   <p>Third, there are equity issues within options 17 to 19. Any flat rate financial penalty will have a higher impact on poorer households, while the assumption that printing and completing paperwork is straightforward for all households can also be challenged. The assumption underlying restrictions on shopping frequency is that people can afford to buy in larger quantities. The risk of tension arising as the police are required to start penalising those who are not adhering should also be factored into considerations. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-10T16:39:16.216Z\">at 5.39pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb81d178f08c0a2409bb1ac\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-10T15:31:22.583Z\">4.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Earlier <strong>Arlene Foster,</strong> the first minister of Northern Ireland, said that, along with the Scottish and Welsh governments, the Northern Ireland executives would be keeping the \u201cstay at home\u201d message.

  "<p>Good morning, this is James Murray bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 11 May.</p> \n<h2>Top stories</h2> \n<p><strong>Ten people were arrested on Sunday and a police officer was injured after protests against Covid-19 lockdown restrictions in Victoria. </strong>More than 100 demonstrators gathered in Melbourne\u2019s CBD to protest against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/10/ten-arrested-and-police-officer-injured-at-protest-against-victorias-covid-19-lockdown-laws\">\u201cself-isolating, social distancing, tracking apps and 5G being installed\u201d</a>. The protest, which was promoted on various Facebook groups linked to fringe conspiracy groups including QAnon and anti-vaxxers, featured signs about China and the Murray-Darling basin. People also chanted: \u201cArrest Bill Gates.\u201d Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said there is a lot of \u201cvery silly misinformation\u201d out there, such as that the 5G network spreads the virus. \u201cThere is absolutely no evidence about 5G doing anything in the coronavirus space,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p><strong>Anthony Albanese will use a speech on Monday to demand a post-Covid-19 recovery \u201cin which no one is left behind\u201d</strong> and there is no return to \u201cthe law of the jungle and unfettered market forces\u201d.<strong> </strong>As the political contest shifts from the public health response to economic recovery, the Labor leader will call on the government to bring forward infrastructure projects and increase investment in affordable housing. \u201cIt\u2019s critical that we are still saying, \u2018We are all in this together,\u2019 after the lockdown has come to an end \u2013 and not just saying it; living up to that standard,\u201d Albanese will say. \u201cLet\u2019s not snap back to insecure work, to jobseekers stuck in poverty, to scientists being ignored.\u201d Albanese makes his speech as a new report from Deloitte Access Economics <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/11/society-must-not-snap-back-to-insecure-work-and-poverty-after-coronavirus-crisis-albanese-says\">warns that national income next financial year could fall nearly $200bn short of predictions</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Donald Trump continued to fume over the Russia investigation on Sunday</strong>, more than a year after the special counsel Robert Mueller filed his report without recommending charges against the president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/10/trump-obama-biggest-political-american-history-russia-michael-flynn\">but only three days after the US justice department said it would drop its case</a> against Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s first national security adviser. Trump used Twitter to accuse Barack Obama of the \u201cthe biggest political crime in US history\u201d. The tweet accompanied a conservative talkshow host\u2019s claim that Obama \u201cused his last weeks in office to target incoming officials and sabotage the new administration\u201d. Since Flynn\u2019s acquittal, Trump has attacked journalists who reported on the events leading to what he describes as \u201cthe impeachment scam\u201d. Mueller did not establish a criminal conspiracy between Trump and Russia in his inquiry but did lay out extensive links with Moscow and instances of possible obstruction of justice by the president.</p> \n<h2>Australia</h2> \n<p><strong>A new Australian green steel industry could create tens of thousands of jobs in regional areas reliant on coalmining, according to a report by the

  "<p>The decision of ITV to replay Euro 96 in full, starting on Monday, is fraught with risk. They say you should never meet your heroes, and the same might apply to legendary sporting events. In this case even those who lived through it first time round and remember it as the very best of times may find, on getting to know it properly and soberly, that the reality does not live up to the myth.</p> <p>Somehow that summer has come to be seen as the pinnacle of Cool Britannia despite the fact that, other than the Spice Girls and the greatest <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJqimlFcJsM\" title=\"\">singalong sporting anthem of all time (probably)</a>, the only British chart-topper was Gary Barlow. Sometimes it seems a considerable amount of gloss has been applied to our mental snapshots of that tournament. As Wayne Rooney once said, asked about that year\u2019s England team: \u201cIt\u2019s as if they won the tournament, the way they\u2019re remembered.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jul/04/1\">From the archive: Rob Smyth on why Euro 96 was overrated</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Attendances were often poor and not only for the less enticing group games \u2013 there were more than 10,000 empty seats at Villa Park for the quarter-final between the Czech Republic and Portugal and a similar number at Old Trafford for the semi-final between the Czechs and France. As for the football, Euro 96 was the first 16-team European Championship and featured 64 goals; the next four, before the tournament increased in size again to 24 teams in 2016, averaged 79. Across the quarter- and semi-finals a total of six goals were scored at the rate of one every 110 minutes (excluding stoppage time).</p> <p>And yet, at times there <em>was</em> something in the air, a magical combination of hope, pride and unabashed communal singing that grew in force as England progressed to the semi-finals. But that the hosts would be at all successful that summer was far from obvious when the competition kicked off.</p> <p>Having not had to qualify, their last competitive fixture had been the World Cup qualifier against San Marino in November 1993 that started with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/oct/10/san-marino-davide-gualtieri-england\" title=\"\">Davide Gualtieri putting the home side ahead</a> after eight seconds and ended Graham Taylor\u2019s inglorious spell in charge.

Back in Europe, Switzerland \u2013 England\u2019s first opponents \u2013 read the papers with interest.</p> <p>\u201cA week before the game they were having a great time in Hong Kong, and we thought maybe they\u2019ll be recovering from the hangover, so maybe it would be an opportunity for us to win against these guys,\u201d Ramon Vega, their centre-back, says. \u201cWe were preparing that week, thinking we might have a good chance because they\u2019ll underestimate us, a small Swiss team, and the way they were acting showed that.\u201d</p> <p>Les Ferdinand, who had just been crowned the PFA player of the year but was destined not to play a single minute at the tournament, was one of the players involved at China Jump. \u201cBack then we had a big drinking culture in our football,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019d come out of a long season and were going into a big tournament and it was the one night we were allowed to go out. We weren\u2019t disrespecting anyone we were playing against, it was just young lads letting their hair down.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/jun/05/england-euro-96-hype-cool-britannia\">England winners at nostalgia but we should not believe the Euro 96 hype | Sean Ingle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The resultant furore, while unpleasant, was not entirely unhelpful. \u201cIt really brought us together,\u201d Ferdinand says. \u201cThere was always a feeling with England that whenever we got to a major competition the media always seemed to be against us, for one reason or another. It just galvanised us all together and it was almost like a siege mentality \u2013 it wasn\u2019t us against the rest of Europe but everyone.\u201d</p> <p>And so to kick-off, and an unconvincing start. Shearer put England ahead midway through the first half but the home side were far from dominant. Switzerland hit the bar before equalising from the penalty spot after a Stuart Pearce handball in the second half. \u201cAs the game went on, we started to gain a lot of confidence,\u201d Vega says. \u201cGoing into the second half we were thinking, these guys aren\u2019t great, no way whatsoever.\u201d</p> <p>The game ended in a draw, and a few England players chose to wind down at Faces, a nightclub in Ilford, Essex, leading to more photographs and tabloid headlines, and a deepening of that siege mentality. \u201cWe just don\u2019t understand that it\u2019s necessary to do what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Venables told the media. \u201cThere are a few that seem like traitors to us.

The Spaniards had the better of the encounter and England needed a couple of penalty decisions, several Seaman saves and a pair of offside calls \u2013 one of which, to disallow Julio Salinas\u2019s 33rd-minute strike, was particularly charitable \u2013 to go their way to make it as far as a penalty shootout.</p> <p>\u201cThe England game was the only game I didn\u2019t play in; you sit and watch it on the bench with a feeling of powerlessness,\u201d says the midfielder Jos\u00e9 Emilio Amavisca. \u201cIt always looks easier from the outside and you sit there thinking you could help. The feeling at the end was so bitter because it was our best game at the Euros. We were quite a lot better than England and we deserved to go through but in that era we kept being struck by the curse of the quarter-finals and we didn\u2019t have that luck.\u201d</p> <p>Before the shootout started Javier Clemente, the Spain manager, considered who should take his side\u2019s penalties. \u201cI never prepared a list in advance,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me, all 11 players on the pitch are capable of taking a penalty. Against England, I approached the first player I had in mind but he said no. I went to the second and he was happy to take one but the third also said no. What can you do in these moments? Nothing.\u201d Fernando Hierro hit the bar, Miguel \u00c1ngel Nadal\u2019s effort was saved and Stuart Pearce\u2019s fist-pumping celebration after exorcising the ghosts of 1990 became one of the images of the tournament.</p> <p>\u201cEverything that could go wrong went wrong against England,\u201d Salinas said. \u201cI had a perfectly good goal disallowed and once again we go out on fucking penalties, with everyone singing \u2018Football\u2019s Coming Home\u2019, which I\u2019ll never be able to get out of my head.\u201d</p> <p>England\u2019s semi-final <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/mar/24/england-v-germany-euro-96-semi-final-live\" title=\"\">followed precisely the opposite course</a>. This time the hosts clicked, created but could not convert their chances: Shearer headed just past the post, Stefan Reuter cleared off the line, Darren Anderton hit the post from six yards, Gascoigne failed to reach the ball as it rolled along the goalmouth. It was 1-1 after 90 minutes, the same half an hour later, and Gareth Southgate missed England\u2019s sixth penalty while Germany\u2019s were perfection.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Gareth missed, it felt a bit like death must do,\u201d Venables said. \u201cIt was the lowest point of my career.

The country\u2019s in a terrible state and that\u2019s because of Brexit, and then there\u2019s the virus. It\u2019s vile. I am not happy in England. The government is utterly deplorable.

  "<p>There\u2019s something profound about the irony. The world\u2019s highest coronavirus death tolls belong to two countries whose leaders came to power promising the restoration of greatness and control \u2013 the United States and Great Britain. Neither can claim to have been caught by surprise: both nations had the benefit of time, ample scientific warnings, and the cautionary examples of China and Italy.</p> <p>The similarities are striking, the conclusions unavoidable. Here in the UK, we comforted ourselves with the belief that while our own buffoonish rightwing leader had his faults, at least he was no Donald Trump. But in the end, Boris Johnson has managed to stumble over even this lowest of hurdles. The UK government\u2019s response to the crisis has turned out to be nearly as flippant and ill-prepared as the US\u2019s.</p> <p>Two nations that prided themselves on their extraordinary economic, historical and political status have been brought to their knees. Their fall from grace is the outcome of a damaged political culture and distinct form of Anglo-American capitalism.</p> <p>Over the past four years, reckless political decisions were justified by subordinating reality to rhetoric. The cost of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/06/donald-tusk-special-place-hell-brexit-promoters-most-likely-burn\">leaving the EU</a> would be \u201cvirtually nil\u201d, with a free trade agreement that would be one of the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jul/20/liam-fox-uk-eu-trade-deal-after-brexit-easiest-human-history\">easiest in human history</a>\u201d. Imaginary enemies were erected and fake fights confected as both countries pugnaciously went about severing their ties with other nations and international institutions.</p> <p>Political discourse focused on grand abstract notions of rebirth and restoration, in a way that required few concrete deliverables. All the Tory government needed to do was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/nov/06/boris-johnson-pledges-to-get-brexit-done-within-weeks-of-re-election-video\">Get Brexit Done</a>, no matter how slapdash the job. In the US, all Trump needed to do to maintain his supporters\u2019 loyalty was bark about a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/22/construction-us-mexico-border-wall-coronavirus-pandemic\">wall with Mexico</a> every now and then, pass a racist travel ban, and savage various public figures for sport.</p> <p>This is corrosive stuff \u2013 not only to the quality of public debate, but to the calibre of politicians. When the business of government becomes limited to populist set pieces, its ranks are purged of doers and populated instead with cheerleaders. This is how we ended up with the current cast of dazed-in-headlights Tory cabinet members. In the US, the very notion of an \u201cadministration\u201d has been worn away. As the New York University journalism professor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu/status/1174409846961168387?lang=en\">Jay Rosen puts it</a>, \u201cThere is no White House. Not in the sense that journalists have always used that term. It\u2019s just Trump \u2013 and people who work in the building.\u201d</p> <p>By the time Covid-19 hit their shores, the UK and US were lacking not just the politicians but the bureaucracies required to respond effectively. Prior to the crisis, Trump repeatedly attempted to defund the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In the UK, the pandemic inconvenienced a Tory cabinet embroiled in a feud with its own civil service. The intellectual and practical infrastructure to deal with facts had been vandalised.</p> <p>But there is a longer, non-partisan history that rendered both nations incapable of an adequate response to the pandemic. The special relationship is not just one of linguistic and cultural proximity, but an ideological partnership forged in the post-second world war era. Anglo-American capitalism, pursued by both right and centre-left parties, rooted in small government and powered by exceptionalism, had dismantled the state. No notice or warning could have refashioned the machinery of government quickly enough to save lives. An economic and political model that hinges on privatisation, liberalisation and the withdrawal of labour rights created a system prone to regular crises, despite such shocks being framed as one-offs.</p> <p>The economic and regulatory kinship<strong> </strong>was strengthened by the transformation of Britain\u2019s quaint and mercantile financial sector into a replica of the US\u2019s aggressive markets. The City caught up with Wall Street.</p> <p>An interventionist foreign policy \u2013 publicly moralistic but privately cynical \u2013 gave the model an expansionist edge, which helped both nations project power abroad and defend their own financial and political interests. But the wars led to quagmires, and the rapidly expanding financial sectors to economic near-death experiences. Neither triggered significant rethinking or reflection. After the 2008 financial crisis, when this system came within \u201c48 hours\u201d of the \u201capocalypse\u201d, two centre-left leaders, Barack Obama and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/feb/21/gordon-brown-saved-banks\">Gordon Brown</a>, chose to shore up the infrastructure that had brought their economies to the brink, recapitalising the banks and revitalising the markets, opting for more regulation rather than fundamental reform.</p> <p>Just as the financial crash was treated as the malfunctioning of a particular unsupervised bug in the system rather than as a feature of it, so is the failure to grapple with the pandemic being cast as an unforeseen, exogenous event, rather than a result of an ideology that enables the state to scramble unprecedented resources to save banks but not lives. A nurse will wear a bin liner as PPE in the US for longer than a failing bank can go unfinanced.</p> <p>Hollow triumphalism about making America great again and Britain taking back control becomes more and more likely in such a system. Trump and the Tories alighted on this formula not entirely out of mendacity or ideology. Without radically challenging Anglo-American capitalism, they have nothing else to offer their voters. And so they must separate economic suffering from politics, and attempt to blame it on immigrants and outsiders. They must blame other countries and international institutions \u2013 the EU, WHO, Nato \u2013 for the feelings of helplessness experienced by their own citizens. The swagger is a facade. Behind it hides a rotting national landscape.</p> <p>As the bodies pile up, the failure of the US and the UK will be somehow spun into victory. The triumphalism will intensify; that is certain. The only question now is how many will continue to believe it.</p> <p>\u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p> <p><br></p>",

  "<p>Of all of the strange side effects of the pandemic, I suppose the craft boom was inevitable.

It started when, unable to sleep one night, I gathered up all the \u201ccrafting\u201d materials I could find in my room (some felt tips and a box of Tampax) and turned five tampons into the Velvet Underground &amp; Nico. This was, it should be said, in the wake of the twee-core explosion of the late 2000s, when doing this sort of thing was considered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jul/16/why-the-manic-pixie-dream-girl-must-never-return\">Zooey Deschanel-esque</a>, and therefore good.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My 'painting' looks like something a nursery school teacher would think twice about before sticking up on the classroom wall</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Until now, this was my last memorable episode of adult crafting.

The different coloured threads hung next to one another, on the same piece of card. There was a weird clippy tool I\u2019d never seen before.

Had I been born hundreds of years ago, I think to myself, this is probably what I would\u2019ve done (as a lesbian) to avoid contact with my rank, toothless, clap-infested husband. I would\u2019ve sat embroidering poorly by candlelight, thinking impure thoughts about wenches. Maybe this is why lesbians are so into crafting: it\u2019s a throwback to the days when they channelled all the sadness of forbidden desire into quietly subversive needlework.</p> <p>But having decided embroidery is emphatically not for me, I move onto modelling clay. Dyspraxic or not, I loved this stuff as a kid, and have warm memories of making animals, vegetables and minerals<strong> </strong>that inevitably fell apart in the oven. I roll out some balls and make colourful, abstract models. The polymer clay is satisfying to mould and play with, especially for someone given to nervous fidgeting. But after about 10 minutes, my hands feel dried out and achy, and I\u2019m desperate to scroll Twitter, check the news and go back to my usual soothing activity of watching back-to-back Simpsons episodes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/04/a-good-yarn-uk-coronavirus-lockdown-spawns-arts-and-craft-renaissance\">A good yarn: UK coronavirus lockdown spawns arts and craft renaissance</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But I will myself to try one last craft. YouTube informs me that, using just cardboard toilet-paper rolls and paint, of which I happen to have both, I can make quite handsome little dandelion prints. Of all crafts I\u2019ve attempted, this seems by far the easiest. You just cut strips into the toilet roll, splay them out and use the end product as a kind of fat paint brush. You\u2019d have to be a mandrill to balls this up.</p> <p>Reader, I balls it up. There\u2019s green and orange paint (the only colours I have) everywhere. My \u201cpainting\u201d looks like something a nursery school teacher would think twice about before sticking up on the classroom wall. It\u2019s an unmitigated disaster. I stand up and look at my war zone of a table, strewn with paint, loose pieces of thread and multicoloured clay crumbs. I can\u2019t deal with this right now, I think to myself. I\u2019m too stressed. And for the endless \u201cbits and bobs\u201d that come with crafting, my lockdown household has become all the more claustrophobic.</p> <ul> <li><p>Eleanor Margolis is a columnist for the i newspaper and Diva.</p></li> </ul>",

  "<p>The number of jobless people in the US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/08/april-jobs-report-us-unemployment-rate\">rose by more than 20 million in April</a>, something deemed worthy of a mention in the \u201cand in other news\u201d slot on the BBC\u2019s evening TV bulletin.</p> <p>Sure, it was the 75th anniversary of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ve-day\">VE day</a> and there were socially distanced street parties to cover and archive footage of crowds gathered in front of Buckingham Palace to treasure.</p> <p>But hang on a minute. In the past, literary careers have been built on the sort of employment catastrophe that has just befallen the world\u2019s biggest economy. It is worth recalling that the war commemorated last week had its roots in Germany\u2019s 6-million long dole queues in the early 1930s.</p> <p>It matters a lot that the official US unemployment rate rose by more than 10 percentage points to 14.7% in a single month, that the real level of joblessness is actually around 25% and is likely to reach 30% before it peaks.</p> <p>Let\u2019s start with the obvious. The April rise in unemployment was bigger than anything seen during the collapse of the US economy during the Great Depression, an economic tragedy that took several years to unfold. Inevitable once the decision was taken to shut down businesses in order to stop the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/10/coronavirus-live-news-obama-trumps-covid-19--chaotic-as-global-cases-pass-4-million-mexico-russia-germany-south-korea-deaths-\">Covid-19</a> virus from spreading, layoffs are hitting the poorest workers hardest. An employee in the bottom 20% of earners was four times as likely to lose their job last month as someone in the highest earning 20%.</p> <p>As in the UK, shuttering businesses across the country is proving easier to do than reopening them. The number of airline passengers currently stands at 7% of last year\u2019s level; in the states where restaurants have reopened for business the number of customers is around 10% of its pre-pandemic levels. The number of weekly jobless claims has come down from its peak but is still running at more than 3 million.</p> <p>All of which suggests that unemployment is going to stay high for some time. The chances of the jobless rate being below 10% by the time Donald Trump stands for re-election in November look remote.</p> <p>Unemployment \u2013 and the risk of being made unemployed \u2013 makes people miserable. There has been plenty of speculation in the past couple of months about whether the lockdown has been good for levels of wellbeing, but the survey evidence and the economic literature suggests it has not.</p> <p>Here in the UK, the Office for National Statistics said the levels of people reporting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/04/half-of-british-adults-felt-anxious-about-covid-19-lockdown\">high levels of anxiety</a> more than doubled when the economy went into hibernation at the end of March. More than half the adult population \u2013 25 million people \u2013 said they were worried about their health, the security of their job or having enough money to get by.</p> <p>A separate coronavirus study from the Mental Health Foundation found that 34% of UK adults surveyed and in full-time work were concerned about losing their jobs; 20% of unemployed people surveyed said they had suicidal thoughts and feelings within the last two weeks; and 11% of unemployed people who have experienced stress during the pandemic said nothing had helped them to cope with the worry and anxiety.</p> <p>There may well be people who are sailing through the lockdown untroubled, but they probably don\u2019t include those who have lost their jobs, think they might be laid off once the government\u2019s furlough scheme comes to an end, or feel responsible as the owner of a small business for the livelihoods of others. Not for them the luxury of working from home on full pay or retirement on an indexed-linked final salary pension.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, it is reasonable to expect similar levels of stress and despair to be prevalent on the other side of the Atlantic, where the welfare state is not known for its generosity. Indeed, the work of economists such as <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w14318.pdf\">Danny Blanchflower</a> and <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2234639?seq=1\">Andrew Oswald</a> has highlighted how higher unemployment is the economic variable most strikingly linked to rising unhappiness, and the longer the spell of unemployment the greater the cost to personal wellbeing.</p> <p>Academic interest in the impact of unemployment on physical and mental health picked up in the 1980s, when deep scars were left by workers enduring long spells of joblessness and in some cases losing touch with the labour market altogether.</p> <p>A priority, therefore, is to prevent temporary layoffs becoming permanent, because that is the path to more poverty, more ill-health, more crime, more relationship breakups and more social alienation. Hence the current heightened interest in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/06/risk-dole-queue-future-young-people-after-covid-19-crisis\">job guarantee schemes for the young</a> and universal basic income for all to supplement strong doses of economic stimulus.</p> <p>The textbook free-market solution to unemployment is that workers can always price themselves back into a job by being willing to take a pay cut. Fortunately, no government in the world believes this nonsense, and the story of the past couple of months has been frantic attempts to prevent a health emergency from morphing into an employment emergency.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Britain\u2019s furlough scheme has been one response to this incipient crisis, but there has also been a response in the US, where Trump, keen not to become the new Herbert Hoover, has adopted a three-pronged approach. Firstly, the administration has provided an extra $600 (\u00a3474) a week in unemployment benefits until the end of July. Secondly, the president has pushed for a reopening of the economy on the grounds that the cure for Covid-19 should not be worse than the disease itself. Finally, he has sought to blame China for America\u2019s problems, because this a lot easier than blaming himself.</p> <p>What does that mean? It means the US has mass unemployment, an explosion of unhappiness, and a sabre-rattling populist leader willing to do anything to hold on to his job. Now, in other news \u2026</p>",

A couple of years on and writer Peter Bowker\u2019s creation of Joe, the marvellous young Max Vento, continues to cause tumults of heart-sorry love, bite-the-walls frustration, wry laughter and wry sobs amid his family, amid those stunning northern fells, and now amid a backdrop of splintered parents living apart. And every parent, never mind every parent of an A-word (autistic) child, can surely grasp the import of the word \u201cchange\u201d on the young, even the apparently invulnerable.</p> <p>Joe is 10 now, and coping with change by dumping his headphones, and his dad\u2019s beloved MP3d punk, which the two of them used to share, when he thinks he\u2019s not \u201chome\u201d. As indeed he\u2019s not, any more. Paul and Alison live 100 miles apart, in new places: a squat, lakeside, stone cottage for Paul (Lee Ingleby); a cheap-swish, Manc dockside mezzanine for Alison (Morven Christie). Christopher Eccleston, still managing to keep his performance <em>just</em> the right side of comedic, cliched \u201cfit northern granda\u201d \u2013 and it\u2019s quite a skill, and finely borne \u2013 is still portrayed as the galumphing, tactless one, but now I\u2019m less sure: his boots-on approach to Joe seems to bear more fruit than Paul\u2019s wriggling, passive empathy and Alison\u2019s controlling righteousness, which after all led to that split.</p> <p>As often with this series, the lens that shines on the differently abled \u2013 Joe, and Ralph, the son with Down\u2019s syndrome (a phenomenal Leon Harrop) of granda Maurice\u2019s love interest \u2013 only serves to refract the limitations of the word \u201cnormal\u201d when applied to adults. Expect also some standout work from (of course) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/27/i-do-my-best-wholeheartedly-julie-hesmondhalgh-on-corrie-corbyn-and-trans-rights\">Julie Hesmondhalgh</a>, who very soon comes into her own as Joe\u2019s teacher, and Molly Wright as sister Rebecca, the only person Joe fully \u201cgets\u201d, now threatening more change via an accidental uni pregnancy, the ramifications of which Joe will cope with by obsessing about car-seat rights. As, actually, one well might.</p> <p>Hardly to be outdone, ITV shone with <strong><a href=\"https://www.itv.com/hub/isolation-stories/10a0115\">Isolation Stories</a></strong>, the first serious TV dramas to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/23/isolation-stories-itv-lockdown-drama-interview-makers\">made under lockdown</a>. Jeff Pope and his writers (Gaby Chiappe, William Ivory, Neil McKay), under strictures that meant everything had to be filmed by partners or co-quarantined similars, and overseen remotely by Zoom or some such, managed to give us almost a full week of edgy and delightful drama that will surely be referred back to by chroniclers of these times.</p> <p>A handful of intriguing 15-minute scripts, a handful of fine actors, filmed at home, with occasional split-screens to reflect the ongoing frustrations of lockdown \u2013 co-workers here, a therapist there \u2013 and who needs ritzy, pricey locations any more?

Some \u2013 and what <em>happened</em> to them in childhood to make them so needy? \u2013 sobbed on phone-camera, or wheedled, or boasted. Some, er, simply coped. All British life was here. And one or two of those who were proudest of the coping were, simply, found wanting. As I might have mentioned, life is messy. This was a great venture, helped immensely by Sheridan Smith and young Tom Glenister.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80197844\">The Eddy</a></strong>, parlayed in a kind of mongrel Franglais-Arabic on the backstreets of Paris \u2013 the shonky suburbs beyond the tracks of the Petite Ceinture that also formed so many settings for <em>Spiral</em> \u2013 is something of a labour of love, all about a dingy, tottering jazz club kept alive through force of personality and sweet, soulful music. The actors either are musicians, or have learned so to become, and it has behind it director Damien Chazelle (<em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/18/whiplash-review-drummer-miles-teller-mark-kermode\">Whiplash</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/15/la-la-land-review-emma-stone-ryan-gosling-damien-chazelle\">La La Land</a></em>) and, as writer, our own Jack Thorne.</p> <p>It\u2019s not short on style. The sax player, for instance, has one of those make-your-mind-up beards only ever encountered in one of two manifestations: a hot, young, black sax player dishing it out in a dirty, basement jazz club in Paris or a Belgian mime artist. The three-generation jazz lovers in the immigration squats of Paris, grandmother beside grandson, have mastered the Arabic art of singing with a smouldering fag between the lips. It feels stylish yet true, and so it\u2019s a welcome universe away from last week\u2019s Netflix <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/03/the-week-in-tv-normal-people-blood-code-404-hollywood-museums-in-quarantine\">Hollywood</a></em> thing, with its rip-off credo that \u201cstyle\u201d can be had for a cheap, raffia trilby and a poster of a trumpet.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMUPp_hNMlM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BMUPp_hNMlM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMUPp_hNMlM\">Watch a trailer for The Eddy</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Not short on style, but that\u2019s part of the problem. The moody shots, the endless rehearsals, the fiddly, stop-start tuning\u2026 I loved it, but even I accept it could have done with a plot. So far, Chazelle seems to be showrunning by draping good jazz on top of a trepanned basic story, about an exiled African American and his stroppy daughter and some Serbian money-goons. It remains to be seen whether Thorne will in future weeks flex his undoubted writing muscles, or bow and take the back seat to his weighty, garlanded director\u2019s singular (if plot-thin) vision.</p> <p>That all said, if Chazelle\u2019s <em>La La Land</em> was bubblegum jazz (which it avowedly was, quite unlike <em>Whiplash</em>, which approached the music like a grown-up), then this is the stuff of cheroots and switchblades. And jazz bounces a little higher once more on its newly healthy tendril, which is the hope of rescue from cliched irrelevance and wilful misunderstanding.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/gb/show/trying/umc.cmc.6muy4la7lj1omu5nci4bt2m66\">Trying</a></strong> is Apple TV+\u2019s first dedicated comedy, apparently, and rather good for what it is. What it is is something about a north London couple trying to adopt, and a refreshingly non-Richard Curtis London couple, for what\u2019s sure to be a global viewership, or as much as Apple TV+ can depend on a global viewership, which is frankly not yet much.</p> <p>It\u2019s funny, genuinely, with some very good lines. Rafe Spall as Jason excels as one half of the trying couple, lugubrious and staunchly anti-intellectual, yet half-wise. Where it falls down, and certainly not with the actor, Esther Smith (Nikki), is in the tweeness of characterisation.

The anti-dumping investigation had been going on for 18 months, with Australia\u2019s cooperation, and Birmingham said Australia sees no basis on which tariffs would be justified. </p> \n  <p>It appears to be an escalation of the diplomatic row between Australia and China, over Australia\u2019s vocal support for an independent investigation into the origin of Covid-19.</p> \n  <p>Asked if Australia risked causing greater offence with Beijing if it fought the anti-dumping findings, Birmingham said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are mounting a case based on evidence.

The first is that it is not available for everybody. And for example, if you\u2019re a worker who is not eligible, maybe because of visa status, maybe because of your age, then it\u2019s not just whether or not we want that person to be paid.

  "<p>Good evening and here is our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Calla Wahlquist bringing you the main stories on Sunday 10 May.</p> \n<h2>Ten arrested at protest against Covid-19 lockdown laws</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/10/ten-arrested-and-police-officer-injured-at-protest-against-victorias-covid-19-lockdown-laws\">Ten people were arrested at a protest outside Melbourne\u2019s Parliament House</a> on Sunday. About 200 people gathered to protest against Victoria\u2019s continued lockdown laws and against the concept of vaccination, chanted for the arrest of Bill Gates, and pushed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/may/01/why-the-5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory-is-false-video-explainer\">conspiracy theory that the coronavirus was linked to the rollout of 5G.</a></p> \n<p>Two of the 10 arrested were the organisers of the protest, police said. The charges for the 10 included breaching Victoria\u2019s state of emergency orders, which expire on Monday and carry a $1,600 on-the-spot fine or potential jail time. Three people were also charged with assaulting a police officer, and one police officer was taken to hospital for a rib injury.</p> \n<h2>NSW to ease restrictions from Friday</h2> \n<p>From Friday, people in New South Wales will be allowed to have five visitors in their home and gather in groups of up to 10 outside. Places of worship will also be open to up to 10 people. Restaurants and cafes will be open to up to 10 dine-in patrons, although premier Gladys Berejiklian conceded that may not be a viable business decision.</p> \n<p>Weddings will be allowed to have 10 guests, funerals 20 attendees if held indoors and 30 if outdoors. However Berejiklian said she was not yet ready to lift the restrictions on regional travel within NSW, and cautioned that the \u201cbiggest threat to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/new-south-wales\">New South Wales</a> community is complacency\u201d. She said if infection rates increased significantly, the state would be locked down again.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a></strong>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>WA announces four-step plan to ease restrictions</h2> \n<p>Western Australia has announced a four-stage plan to ease lockdown restrictions. The state is currently in phase one and will move to phase two, which will allow for indoor gatherings of up to 20 people, and allow restaurants, cafes, and pubs to reopen for up to 20 patrons, from Monday 18 May. Phase three will happen about four weeks after that, details to be confirmed, and then phase four will happen at a date to be fixed.</p> \n<p>Phase two will also allow groups of up to 20 to engage in non-contact sport, swimming in outdoor pools, and indoor and outdoor fitness classes. Weddings and funerals can have up to 20 participants if indoors and 30 if outdoors.</p> \n<p>The 13 regional borders in WA will be replaced with four, allowing for travel between neighbouring regions. The hard border with the eastern states will remain in place. Premier Mark McGowan said it \u201chas been our strongest weapon in the fight against this virus\u201d and \u201cwill likely be the final restriction that we lift\u201d.</p> \n<h2>Australia records 14 new cases</h2> \n<p>Australia recorded just 14 new cases of coronavirus overnight. Ten of those cases were in Victoria, including one connected to the Cedar Meats cluster, bringing the total number of cases in that cluster to 79. Queensland and NSW both recorded two new cases each.</p> \n<h2>China threatens barley tariffs</h2> \n<p>The Australian government is trying to convince China not to go ahead with proposed tariffs against Australian-grown barley, which could devastate the $1.5bn trade. Beijing has indicated it may impose the tariffs because it claims an 18-month long anti-dumping investigation, which Australia participated in, has found evidence of dumping and anti-competitive behaviour. Australian trade minister Simon Birmingham says there is no evidence to show Australia engaged in dumping, and that Australian barley farmers \u201coperate on an entirely commercial basis\u201d. It follows weeks of escalating tension between Canberra and Beijing over Australia\u2019s support for an independent investigation into the origin of Covid-19.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily coronavirus newsletter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download it</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>What you need to know: get the most important information from some of our key explainers</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/australias-coronavirus-lockdown-rules-explained-can-i-still-visit-my-partner-and-other-questions\">Australia\u2019s coronavirus lockdown rules explained: can I still visit my partner and other questions</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/ng-interactive/2020/mar/26/how-many-cases-of-coronavirus-are-there-in-australia-live-covid-19-numbers-and-statistics\">Coronavirus Australia maps and cases: live numbers and statistics</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/03/social-distancing-rules-australia-coronavirus-strict-new-laws-legal-illegal-state-physical-restrictions-guidelines-explained-nsw-victoria-qld-queensland-act-sa-wa-two-person-rule\">Australia\u2019s strict new coronavirus social distancing rules explained: state by state guidelines</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/02/free-childcare-what-do-the-governments-coronavirus-changes-mean-for-my-family\">Free childcare: what do the Australian government\u2019s coronavirus changes mean for my family?</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/01/jobkeeper-payment-am-i-eligible-for-the-wage-subsidy-how-do-i-register-ato-jobseeker-supplement-support-package-eligibility\">Am I eligible for the jobkeeper payment?

  "<p>It is 100 days since the first coronavirus case was confirmed in the UK on 31 January. The official death toll so far from the epidemic has topped 33,000 and is still rising fast. The actual total could be far higher, many analysts say \u2013 leaving Britain among the countries hit hardest by Covid-19.</p> \n<p>The government has struggled to get on top of the crisis, facing growing criticism for its lack of early preparation to tackle the virus, its abrupt shifts in strategy, its failure to provide adequate protective equipment for its medical staff and other key workers, and its inability to organise testing on the scale that many say is vital.</p> \n<p>And its communications have been widely described as evasive and shambolic \u2013 with many left confused last week as the Cabinet battled to provide a coherent account of its plans to lift the lockdown.</p> \n<p>Those plans have been complicated by the fact that our infection rate remains stubbornly high and, as a result, any measures announced by Boris Johnson on Sunday are expected to be modest. While some other countries are embarking tentatively on a return to normality, Britain is struggling to meet its criteria for doing so.</p> \n<p>Amid a growing perception that the government\u2019s record in confronting the crisis is amongst the worst in the world, the Labour leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/may/06/keir-starmer-confronts-boris-johnson-for-first-time-during-pmqs-video-highlights\">Keir Starmer confronted Boris Johnson</a> this week in their first prime minister\u2019s questions meeting with the stark question: \u201cHow on earth did it come to this?\u201d</p> \n<p>Below Robin McKie, Toby Helm and Emma Graham-Harrison try to answer that question by considering the key factors that might lie behind our disaster.</p> \n<h2>Politics</h2> \n<p>Over the past week there have been moments when members of the government have given up pretending that all has gone well. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/19/the-uk-governments-woeful-response-to-the-coronavirus-outbreak\">evidence of the mishandling</a> of the pandemic response has piled up, some ministers have realised they would sound ridiculous if they could not admit that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/19/the-observer-view-on-the-coronavirus-errors-that-have-cost-precious-lives\">errors had been made</a>.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday, James Brokenshire, a home office minister, accepted that more testing early on would have helped. \u201cThere is an acknowledgement mistakes have been made \u2013 no government is going to get everything right,\u201d he said. Then at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions the same day Boris Johnson admitted his \u201cbitter regret\u201d at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/28/the-guardian-view-on-covid-19-and-care-homes-promises-are-not-enough\">crisis in care homes.</a> But they have been rare admissions.</p> \n<p>Over the last few days the UK\u2019s political leaders have been divided over the lockdown and how to keep the public safe. Mid-week, Downing Street was indicating it wanted to end the \u201cstay at home\u201d message while Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s First Minister, protested that to do so would risk many more lives. The issue was still being debated at the highest levels on Friday as No 10 appeared to be backing off such a change.</p> \n<p>No one can expect politicians to handle a crisis on this scale without things going wrong along the way. Labour, under its new leader Keir Starmer, has acknowledged that. He held back in his criticism until last week, knowing that the country wanted this government to succeed. But he, too, would not have been doing his job had he not highlighted government failings in his first PMQ with Johnson. Why, he asked, had the government been slow on testing, slow on supplying PPE to NHS and care home workers, slow on going into lockdown? </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"bec38c7e-4c90-4d90-9f12-e5d02ade213e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cohpBp316i8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>When the inevitable public inquiry is held, Johnson\u2019s government will face hard questions about its response. When many <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/15/uk-government-coronavirus-science-who-advice\">UK scientists were growing increasingly worried</a> about Covid-19 in January and February, Johnson and his team had other things on their minds \u2013 enjoying their general election win and \u201cgetting Brexit done\u201d.</p> \n<p>Johnson inherited public services ill-equipped to handle a pandemic. The NHS lacked enough intensive care beds, protective equipment for staff and, initially, ventilators. The social care sector, shamefully unreformed, was another victim of Tory austerity that has paid the price. Anglo-Saxon economics has left the UK vulnerable, whereas countries which had spent more on their health systems \u2013 Germany is the prime example \u2013 have fared better.</p> \n<p>Decision-making has also been found wanting. The UK ended track-and-trace testing on 12 March, because there was not the capacity to carry on.

These soon expanded to over 120 measures including strict quarantine, border controls, testing and contact tracing.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe learned very harsh lessons from Sars and that experience is something other countries don\u2019t have,\u201d said Chan Chang-chuan, dean of National Taiwan University\u2019s College of Public Health. To date, its Covid-19 death toll is six, despite its very close economic and cultural ties with mainland China, and a high volume of cross-border travel between the two.</p> \n<p>South Korea endured Sars and has even more recent memories of a fatal coronavirus epidemic, after Mers (Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome) broke out there in 2015, killing 36 people. It began ramping up testing capacity from January, before the disease had arrived in force.</p> \n<p>At one point the country had the highest number of cases outside mainland China, but its testing and careful contact tracing meant it was among the first and most successful countries in flattening the curve.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7a8aefc4-c87c-430c-81cd-7b8b5fa27431\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VIZouD5qaLM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Experience of Sars may have made governments more confident the public would accept restrictions, and that proved indeed to be the case: many people took proactive measures, such as covering their faces, even before authorities stepped in.</p> \n<p>And in Africa, experience of Ebola may have helped Sierra Leone keep cases to just 231 so far; authorities repurposed tracking systems set up in the wake of the 2014 outbreak.</p> \n<p>But there are also countries that have not lived through recent outbreaks of respiratory epidemics that have responded fast and kept cases low, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/new-zealand-records-first-day-with-no-new-covid-19-cases-since-before-lockdown\">New Zealand</a> to Senegal and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/danes-and-czechs-say-easing-lockdowns-has-produced-no-covid-19-surge\">Denmark</a>.</p> \n<p>So while past experience may have helped some countries, it was not a necessary condition for a rapid and effective response and should not be seen as an explanation for why the UK has been so badly affected.</p> \n<p><em>Emma Graham-Harrison</em></p> \n<h2>Demography</h2> \n<p>Age clearly plays a key part in influencing the outcome of Covid-19 and is highlighted as a cause of some of the widespread variations seen in death tolls from different countries. Italy and Spain have relatively old populations and have suffered high death rates while nations such as Ireland, with lower median ages, have fared better. So could the UK\u2019s relatively elderly population explain our high death rates?</p> \n<p>No, said Professor Sarah Harper, founding director of the Oxford Institute of Population Ageing.</p> \n<p>\u201cFrom a demographic point of view, the UK is no different from most other European countries. In fact, we are on the younger side, so you cannot blame the age structure of the UK for this.\u201d</p> \n<p>In addition, care homes \u2013 claimed by some to be a special UK issue \u2013 have proved to be serious problems in other nations with substantial Covid-19 death rates, including France, Belgium and Norway. \u201cCare home outbreaks are almost inevitable without really radical measures to prevent them,\u201d said Professor Noel McCarthy, of Warwick Medical School.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"070e1ce7-43bd-462f-80b5-0be91d966238\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XPF35H9RLNE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Scientists have also found that individuals from black and minority ethnic (BAME) groups have been disproportionately affected by Covid-19 in Britain. About 13% of the UK population come from BAME backgrounds but they account for a third of virus patients in critical care units. Last week, figures for England and Wales suggested that black people were four times more likely to die from Covid-19 than white people.</p> \n<p>However, this picture is not unique to the UK. Nations that include Norway and the US have also reported high Covid-19 death rates among BAME people. Just why this is occurring remains unclear \u2013 though scientists point out that BAME groups tend to suffer from higher rates of diabetes, heart disease and obesity, conditions that make people more vulnerable to Covid-19.</p> \n<p>Another key risk factor is obesity. Those with a body mass index greater than 30 are more likely to need intensive care than those with healthy weights. Britain is facing a major obesity problem, doctors have pointed out, and this could explain, in part, our high Covid-19 fatality rate of <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1104709/coronavirus-deaths-worldwide-per-million-inhabitants/\">nearly 500 deaths per million people</a>. Yet this picture is confounded by comparisons with other nations. For example, New Zealand has a worse prevalence of obesity than the UK but has a Covid-19 death rate of only 4 per million.</p> \n<p>\u201cTo be blunt, it was a lack of testing, a failure to shut down society in time, and a lack of care equipment that are to blame for current high Covid-19 death rates,\u201d said Harper.</p> \n<p><em>Robin McKie</em></p> \n<h2>Geography</h2> \n<p>Britain is a densely populated nation containing a very large capital city. More than 9 million people live in London and more than 18 million people arrived in the UK in the first three months of the year: a perfect nursery setting for a new virus to take seed and then increase in numbers in an explosive, exponential manner. Other densely populated places such as New York and northern Italy have also suffered.</p> \n<p>So was the UK simply unfortunate? Has its population felt the impact of Covid-19 more deeply because of its geography?</p> \n<p>The link is weak, say epidemiologists, who point to many other cramped, bustling cities that have relatively low numbers of Covid-19 cases at present. A good example is provided by India. It is the world\u2019s second most populous nation and its cities \u2013 including Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata, some of the biggest and most populous urban centres in the world \u2013 are renowned for their dense populations and tightly packed housing. Yet Covid-19 death rates are remarkably low there. Last week, the death rate from the disease stood at 1 per million people in India, it was reported. The UK\u2019s rate is reported at nearly 500 per million.</p> \n<p>As a result, many UK scientists reject the idea that Britain\u2019s high death toll is simply a matter of unfortunate positioning or a result of the high density of much of its population. \u201cWere we unlucky? No. We just didn\u2019t have a proper plan for dealing with this. Other countries did,\u201d said virologist Professor Nicola Stonehouse, of Leeds University.</p> \n<p>This point was backed by consultant cardiologist Amitava Banerjee. \u201cWe were not humble enough to look at other countries \u2013 China, Italy or Spain \u2013 and learn a lesson from them and lock down quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is as simple as that.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cWe were arrogant,\u201d added Banerjee, who is also assistant professor of clinical data science at University College London. \u201cWe thought we had nothing to learn from other countries and thought we were an exceptional case. In fact, we had a lot to learn but didn\u2019t take the opportunity.\u201d</p> \n<p>Taking lessons from past mistakes and from the examples of other nations will be crucial if Britain is to hope to extricate itself from the medical crisis it now faces, say epidemiologists.</p> \n<p><em>Robin McKie</em></p> \n<h2>Endgame</h2> \n<p>How Britain extricates itself from its coronavirus lockdown will be a delicate procedure, scientists agree. In general, they envisage an approach that would maintain restrictions until numbers of Covid-19 cases are low enough to allow the tracking and isolating of individual cases.</p> \n<p>However, at the current rate of infections, it is hard to see when that might occur. Last week, the number of new cases of Covid-19 that were being diagnosed every day hovered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/coronavirus-uk-latest-deaths-confirmed-cases-and-which-regions-are-hardest-hit\">around the 5,000 mark</a>. That is far too high to allow tracing of newly infected individuals. The tracking system would be overwhelmed in days. The country therefore faces a choice. It could endure even harsher lockdown rules \u2013 with no exercise permitted \u2013 or maintain the current system for months. Alternatively, it could ease the lockdown in the near future and risk facing a rapidly rising <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/covid-19-second-wave-may-be-avoided-with-track-and-trace-says-uk-science-chief\">second wave of cases</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e91b1dca6c7593cbcae9e252df80c1d9e2ca7a58\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e91b1dca6c7593cbcae9e252df80c1d9e2ca7a58/291_151_4590_2754/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A researcher in a lab developing a vaccine for Covid-19.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A researcher in a lab developing a vaccine for Covid-19.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Whenever lockdown is relaxed, emphasis is likely to be placed on shielding the vulnerable, in particular those who have high risk factors, such as the elderly. They would be isolated and their visitors given daily tests to show if they had been exposed to the virus.</p> \n<p>However, this idea is questioned by Professor Sarah Harper of the Oxford Institute of Population Ageing. \u201cIf you look at the mathematical models, you can see that if we remove the over-70s from everyday life we could slow down viral transmission and possibly stave off a second wave of Covid-19. But we would be doing something purely on the basis of age.\u201d And that, said Harper, could be seen as unfair.</p> \n<p>\u201cMathematical models are useful for describing different alternative scenarios but these then have to be considered in the light of societal acceptability by our policy-makers and politicians.</p> \n<p>\u201cOlder people are not the only ones vulnerable to Covid-19. Men are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/men-die-of-coronavirus-at-twice-womens-rate-in-england-and-wales\">twice </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/men-die-of-coronavirus-at-twice-womens-rate-in-england-and-wales\">more likely to die</a> of the disease than women, while people from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/why-are-people-from-bame-groups-dying-disproportionately-of-covid-19\">BAME communities </a>also have higher than average death rates. What if the modelling showed that removing all men from society for a longer time would have a similar effect? Would such a plan be acceptable? Probably not.\u201d</p> \n<p>A vaccine is a long-term hope but there may be other measures that decrease transmission that are available now, added Professor Noel McCarthy of Warwick Medical School. \u201cFor example, if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/24/face-masks-mandatory-spread-coronavirus-government\">public mask-wearing</a> decreased spread by 20% it would reduce mortality by more than the whole of the lockdown to date \u2013 but we need real evidence, such as a large-scale trial, to give evidence to support this in the longer term.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Robin McKie</em></p>",

For centuries the history of crofting has been stained with tears and Calidas\u2019s memoir is no exception: IVF treatment fails, her marriage breaks down, and she fractures both hands.

Calidas describes continuing intimidation and abuse at the hands of some islanders. They object to her presence on the croft as an outsider, as English, as of mixed heritage and, later, as a single woman daring to work the land like a man.</p> <p>In one bleak episode, Calidas tells of her pride in her tup, a breeding ram that wins a prize at the island\u2019s agricultural fair, but dies some weeks later. Then, she reveals, a chance word makes her think the sheep might have been poisoned. On Halloween night, she exhumes the body and takes it to Glasgow for examination by a veterinary pathologist: the results are inconclusive.</p> <p>That incident was familiar to several islanders. Both Neil Carmichael and his father John said that baseless accusations had been made. (Calidas denies any accusations came from her.) Several islanders have anecdotes about other flashpoints. It\u2019s clear that ill-feeling for Calidas lingers.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s just a load of rubbish,\u201d John Carmichael said of the book. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s done anything to her, as far as I know \u2026 She always did really have a chip on her shoulder.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A lot of people from down south have money to buy property here \u2026 but anyone who does come has always been very welcome</p> <footer> <cite>Neil Carmichael, crofter</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A woman whose family ties on the island stretch back for generations said: \u201cOf course it\u2019s desperately sad. But to repay people\u2019s kindness in this way is odd even for her. We\u2019re finding it quite amusing.\u201d</p> <p>The scorn is not uniform. Another islander, an incomer like Calidas, spoke of the picture of \u201cwonderful welcoming communities\u201d painted by travel guides to the western highlands. \u201cPeople are incredibly kind-hearted, incredibly generous and will go a long, long way out of their way to help,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when it comes to land and tradition and family, there\u2019s another side.\u201d In the book, Calidas hints at islanders believing the croft ought to be theirs.</p> <p>But the established families don\u2019t see it that way. \u201cAnyone can pick up the phone and get help from anyone,\u201d Neil Carmichael said. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of new people.\u201d Since Calidas arrived in 2004, the island has become less focused on farming and more on tourism, with people from Mexico, Germany and the Netherlands now living there. \u201cA lot of people have come from down south and have the money to buy properties up here.
