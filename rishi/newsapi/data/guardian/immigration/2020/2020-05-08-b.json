For this I can\u2019t set a menu as I do not know how things will be. However we intend to have a really good meal regardless of price. Should this meal take place in any other place than London or if I have to wait any length of time at Euston station I intend going to the YMCA there and have another meal which will consist of the following:</em></p> \n   <p><em>Sausage or bacon<br>Mash or chips<br>Bread butter and tea<br>Sweet: Fruit and custard<br>Or Trifle and custard<br>Cakes and tea</em></p> \n   <p><em>This is usually obtainable there or was six months ago. <br><br>I then intend to buy 12 hot dogs.

This would consist of 2 fried eggs, 2 rashers of ham, chips and fried bread with bread, butter, jam and tea cake or pastry. I hope that I shall be able to get the same meal as I have looked forward to it many times in the past.

On the face of it everything went on as normal. We still went to work escorted by sentries each day but the hydrowerk had been put out of production by bombing. Because of lack of food we were now all lacking in energy and did very little work but we had to be on the job and just went through the motions. It was an effort to march to and from the workplace. </em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He added: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>The sheer chaos in central Europe at the end of the war was beyond believe and description. There were exPOWs but large numbers of forced workers, men and women of all ages and nationalities all on foot and trying to go home. Practically all were hungry and poorly dressed, many without shoes. Some I believe were former soldiers who had found civvies but they kept a low profile and also German civilians trying to get to the west out of the hands of the Russians.</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b8f77f2152835c6158da9a8745f87a4e096dea7\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b8f77f2152835c6158da9a8745f87a4e096dea7/0_0_1333_2000/667.jpg\" alt=\"Jane Hodges' father\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-08T13:08:32.328Z\">at 2.08pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb550828f08464cd4296987\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-08T12:29:15.985Z\">1.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e648a4433b2663b7c170c5e9cf50fc416ecff056\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e648a4433b2663b7c170c5e9cf50fc416ecff056/0_0_3245_1948/1000.jpg\" alt=\"VE 75 is written in the skies over Somerset.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">VE 75 is written in the skies over Somerset.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>The UK\u2019s first skytyping display has been held to mark VE Day and pay tribute to frontline workers. </p> \n  <p>Messages such as We Will Meet Again and Thank You were etched in the sky above Henstridge airfield in Somerset. </p> \n  <p>The display was commissioned by the Department for Transport, which recently introduced a law change to allow skytyping and skywriting to take place. </p> \n  <p>The techniques were outlawed in the UK in the 1960s over safety concerns, but are used in many countries such as the US, Australia, France and Spain. </p> \n  <p>Skywriting was inadvertently discovered by an RAF pilot during the First World War, when oil accidentally entered a plane\u2019s exhaust, creating dense, white smoke. </p> \n  <p>According to the DfT, skytyping, which involves smoke being emitted in a series of bursts, was not conducted in the UK before Friday\u2019s display in Somerset. </p> \n  <p>The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Victory in Europe Day will always be a landmark in British history and it is an honour to have commissioned the first skytyping display in the UK to mark the occasion. </p> \n   <p>With its strong British history, stemming from the creation of skywriting, it seems an entirely fitting way to honour all those who fought for our freedom while also thanking those keeping the country moving during this challenging time.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-08T12:32:59.592Z\">at 1.32pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb54cbd8f08464cd429696a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-08T12:13:14.954Z\">1.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Boris Johnson speaks to 102-year-old veteran</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The prime minister told a 102-year-old war veteran he was \u201cawesome\u201d after the two-minute silence held at 11am to mark VE Day. <br><br>Boris Johnson\u2019s official spokesman told reporters during a briefing: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>He held a Zoom call with a veteran, an amazing guy by the name of Ernie Horsfall.

I had recently returned to my grandfather\u2019s empty villa in the city of Lodz, after nearly six years on the run. I come from a Jewish family, and all of my immediate relatives died in the Holocaust. I only survived because I escaped from a train bound for Treblinka, after which I joined the Polish resistance. We fought the Germans in Warsaw, but after they were defeated the Soviets occupied our country and they were arresting and executing Polish home army officers. It was also the time that I realised that my family, for whom I had been waiting in Lodz, wasn\u2019t going to come home.</p> \n   <p>While the rest of Europe celebrated, we were in hiding. We already knew for a few months that the war would end soon, but that it would not bring us any great joy. It was just another grey day, the end of years of suffering, but no freedom. I\u2019m not sure that everyone in Poland felt the same way as us, but we did see substantial collaboration with the new regime. </p> \n   <p>For me, VE Day meant the end of one horror and the beginning of another that I didn\u2019t want to be a part of. After the war I left Europe and moved to what would become Israel. I know it marks a great achievement, but for the last 75 years I have never celebrated this day and I doubt I ever will - the part of me that remains strongly Polish does not allow me to do so.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-08T10:23:42.487Z\">at 11.23am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb52ca08f08464cd42967bf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/daniel-boffey\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-08T10:11:44.192Z\">11.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A 98-year-old RAF veteran has completed a 2.2-mile walk in Belgium to raise funds for a much-loved soldiers\u2019 club in the Flemish town of Poperinge.<br><br>George Sutherland, the son of a Belgian mother and Scottish father, escaped to Britain when the Germans invaded Belgium in 1940.</p> \n  <p>He walked from Lijssenthoek commonwealth war cemetery in Poperinge to Talbot House, a clubhouse for all the ranks founded in 1915 but which is facing financial ruin because of the coronavirus lockdown.<br></p> \n  <p>Sutherland had a police escort and was accompanied by a pipe major from the memorial bagpipe band of the Church of our Lady in Poperinge.

  "<p>Before the pandemic struck, Sara Blazey made the same three-hour commute to work, three days a week, for the better part of 12 years. The 63-year-old family lawyer from the Blue Mountains works for a domestic violence legal advice hotline in Parramatta and it used to be that she would wake at 7am, drive seven minutes to Hazelbrook station and from there catch the 7.17am train to Parramatta before making the same one-and-a-half hour trip home in the evening.</p> <p>With the pandemic, all that would change. Domestic violence support services such as the one Blazey worked for were declared \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/covid-19-will-slam-the-door-shut-australias-family-services-brace-for-domestic-violence-spike\">essential</a>\u201d services, meaning they could keep operating despite restrictions. To ensure they could do so safely, the organisation did what some commentators long thought impossible and began to transition its employees into working from home.</p> <p>\u201cThere were a couple of us older ones in the office who said it all sounds too hard, really,\u201d Blazey says. \u201cAnd then we were reluctant to work from home. My home is my home. I don\u2019t particularly want to do my work from there.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"0c266c7813181580bd5a31029deb939c1634272b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c266c7813181580bd5a31029deb939c1634272b/0_0_5279_3519/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The road to Katoomba in the Blue Mountains\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The road to Katoomba in the Blue Mountains.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the country went through a collective tech upgrade, millions of workers like Blazey retreated from office blocks and entire cities emptied out. It was a pattern that would be replicated worldwide. Streets devoid of cars and pavements free of people were so haunting that photographs of cities including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-photos-us-new-york-seattle-washington\">New York</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/mar/15/europe-empties-its-streets-to-slow-coronavirus-in-pictures\">Paris</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/gallery/2020/apr/24/look-no-people-sydney-seen-from-the-air-during-coronavirus-lockdown-in-pictures\">Sydney</a> were shared across social media.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/08/work-after-coronavirus-how-will-it-change-when-the-lockdown-is-over\">Work after coronavirus: how will it change when the lockdown is over?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Within Australia, the scale of this change was captured in data obtained by the Grattan Institute. Anonymised geolocation data gathered from people\u2019s mobile phones showed how crowds in central business districts along the east coast had thinned by half even before the Australian government announced stage-one restrictions on social movement. By mid-April they would be nearly deserted. Crowding in the Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane CBDs had fallen to a fifth or less, while crowding around suburban train stations had fallen to a 10th.</p> <p>Those like Blazey might have regained an extra three hours in their day but, as society begins to reopen, the question now is whether the embrace of working from home sticks. Should it become permanent, it may drive a radical change in the way governments think about how we drive, fly, commute and ride in the post-pandemic world.</p> <h2><strong>Planes, trains and cars</strong></h2> <p>Already transport is taking centre stage. In mid-April Labor\u2019s transport spokeswoman, Catherine King, called for the construction of a high-speed rail line to be built between Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne as a brace against a looming recession. King billed the idea \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/26/from-showpiece-to-goat-track-the-long-dangerous-decline-of-sydney-to-melbourne-rail-travel\">which has been around since the 1980s</a> \u2013 as a \u201cgame changer\u201d for regions along its route.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"57233788bc4efd302b894fc02459f9a3a61bca60\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57233788bc4efd302b894fc02459f9a3a61bca60/0_0_5076_3384/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Catherine King\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Labor\u2019s transport spokeswoman, Catherine King, calls high-speed rail a \u2018game changer\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Ross/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHigh-speed rail has the potential to revolutionise interstate travel, allowing travel between capital cities in as little as three hours,\u201d King said.</p> <p>As an idea, the thought was as much about the past as it was the future. A century ago, when economies were transport-driven, everything depended on the ability to move people around. Ever since, planes, trains and cars have played an outsized role in the imagination, especially for policymakers looking for \u201cshovel-ready\u201d projects.</p> <p>Marion Terrill of the Grattan Institute says this romance may prove costly today. Having studied proposals for high-speed rail, she says that if the country were to lock itself into such a project, it would be 22 years before the first leg was complete and it would be 39 years \u2013 if not longer \u2013 before the country saw any reduction in carbon emissions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"339e16f2e64fb4b16bbd8d52759179e98378bfed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/339e16f2e64fb4b16bbd8d52759179e98378bfed/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The WestConnex tunnel at Haberfield in Sydney\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sydney\u2019s WestConnex tunnel.

With no vaccine expected for at least 18 months \u2013 if ever \u2013 it is possible social distancing regulations may remain even as restrictions on social movement are lifted. With lower capacities and lower populations expected, it may no longer be possible to justify many existing projects, including the $18.6bn WestConnex underground roadway and a second airport for Sydney.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/07/our-income-vanished-australias-galleries-and-museums-buckle-in-covid-19-storm\">'Our income vanished': Australia's galleries and museums buckle in Covid-19 storm</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These decisions may raise questions about the future of mass transit itself, especially among austerity-minded governments concerned about their debt burdens. Faced with renewed mistrust of public spaces and social distancing requirements, public transport systems must now be retrofitted to reduce touchable surfaces and capacity. Doing so carries a cost beyond the financial.</p> <p>The risk, says Prof Kim Dovey, the chair of architecture and urban design at Melbourne University, is that the lowering capacity will make public transport unviable when what\u2019s needed is a massive expansion.</p> <p>\u201cThe virus is really an attack on cities, in many ways,\u201d Dovey says. \u201cOne of its biggest effects is it stops cities from functioning effectively. It stops people from coming together and interacting. This, in my view, is what makes cities work.</p> <p>\u201cIf people want to stay two metres apart from each other into the future, that will kill cities.\u201d</p> <p>Thought of in this way, Covid-19 is the sociological equivalent of a distributed denial of service attack \u2013 where a swarm of computers repeatedly attempt to access the same system all at once, eventually overloading it with demand. If at the start of the pandemic the main concern was the ability of health systems to cope, now the worry is that secondary systems like transport will buckle.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We should be out there turning streets into walkways. All you need is a bit of authority and paint on the road</p> <footer> <cite>Kim Dovey</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The consequences are profound. If density and walkability combine to make cities vibrant places to live, public transport is the sinew that makes it possible. Cars may have dominated cities over the last century but in the last decade patronage of public transport has slowly grown once more. Should this trend be broken, Dovey says, the result would be \u201ctragic\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cReducing public transport to 30% will kill cities,\u201d he says. \u201cWe really need to go the other way.\u201d</p> <p>These concerns go beyond trains, trams and buses to the \u201cmicrospatiality\u201d of cities and efforts to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/jul/24/the-us-government-has-checked-out-on-renewables-can-cities-fill-the-gap\">green them</a>. The more room provided for cars, the less there is for footpaths. Lifts in high-rises built to handle eight to 10 people become unworkable when they are limited to one or two.</p> <p>\u201cRight now a lot of people will avoid public transport for a while, which means they\u2019ll get in their cars,\u201d Dovey says. \u201cAnd that will produce demand for more roads, as it always does.</p> <p>\u201cPeople still believe building roads can ease congestion but that is not true. All it does is stimulate demand for cars. This is going to set back major moves for cities that have been going on for a long time, particularly in trying to claw back space for usage from cars.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>A fork in the road</strong></h2> <p>In January 2019 the Australian car fleet numbered 19.5m, <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mediareleasesbytitle/28861A19CCDB9441CA25753D001B59DA?OpenDocument\">according</a> to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. With millions now out of work or working from home, many of these vehicles have remained off the road. What comes next depends on what happens when restrictions are eased and those people go back to work \u2013 particularly as global oil prices remain low.</p> <p>The cause was simple enough. As whole national economies were put on ice at the start of the pandemic, the world\u2019s oil producers kept pumping even as demand fell off a cliff. When they ran out of storage the mismatch between supply and demand grew so chronic <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil-russia-production/repair-abandon-burn-russia-explores-options-for-historic-oil-cut-idUSKCN2252RD\">oil producers</a> in Russia found it easier to burn their excess, marking a disaster for efforts to combat climate change.</p> <p>\u201cOil fields are not like wine bottles, where you can put in a cork and return to it later,\u201d Jeff Colgan says. \u201cShutting an oil field down can damage it, which reduces or even eliminates the field\u2019s future production.\u201d</p> <p>Colgan is the Richard Holbrooke associate professor of political science at Brown University and expert on the global oil industry, who says low fuel prices will last for some time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"233290fba52c48f1092c7dd46c92aea86b1d826a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/233290fba52c48f1092c7dd46c92aea86b1d826a/148_0_5723_3434/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A tram on the near-empty Bourke Street mall in central Melbourne\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A tram on the near-empty Bourke Street mall in central Melbourne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Asanka Ratnayake/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cNothing lasts forever in the oil business but low oil prices are probably here to stay for at least the rest of the year and perhaps much longer,\u201d he says. \u201cEven when consumer demand increases after lockdowns end, there is an awful lot of inventory build-up that will keep prices from rising too quickly.\u201d</p> <p>Against this global backdrop, Australia \u2013 which boasts the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/05/among-the-worst-in-oecd-australias-addiction-to-cheap-dirty-petrol\">highest sulphur content</a> fuel in the OECD and rising road transport emissions \u2013 finds itself caught between two competing futures.</p> <p>On the one hand, persistent low oil prices will make petrol cars cheaper to run, frustrating any attempt to encourage the uptake of electric vehicles as part of a transition to a zero-carbon economy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4721c74c855ffecc169d271fe96f1113b419c23e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4721c74c855ffecc169d271fe96f1113b419c23e/0_0_5363_3575/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A electric vehicle\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Electric vehicles are improving all the time.

When Australia\u2019s largest trading partner lifted restrictions and moved to reopen its factories early this month, its people <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-is-open-for-business-but-the-post-coronavirus-reboot-looks-slow-and-rocky-11585232600\">stayed home</a>. Should this pattern be repeated the world over, the cumulative fall in demand would destabilise oil-producing economies, while making it harder to decarbonise transport at home.</p> <p>Some like John Quiggin lean more to this second scenario. While he acknowledges incentives created in the post-pandemic world may lead to less public transport and more cars on the road, the University of Queensland economist says \u201cmost forces are going the other way\u201d. If historically the opposition to working from home by business was a meta-conversation about their ability to trust their workforce, the focus could shift to basic costs as social distancing regulations remain and the capacity of a working office falls.</p> <p>\u201cOffices are going to be under pressure to keep a lot of space and the very low-cost way of doing that is to give people a choice about whether they come in or not,\u201d Quiggin says. \u201cMeanwhile, electric vehicles are improving all the time. Their take-up comes with anything that pauses the growth of the car fleet which gives EVs a chance.\u201d</p> <p>What is true for the average employee will also be true for the boardroom. Even if Australia has avoided the worst of the virus, other countries have not. Many will remain in a state of lockdown for some time, forcing individual countries or regions to become more self-reliant. Freight may continue to move across borders into the future but people will not. Anyone looking to travel for business faces the prospect of a mandatory five- to 14-day quarantine each time a border is crossed. In the end, it will be easier \u2013 and cheaper \u2013 to do deals by video conference.</p> <p>The same could also be said for Australia\u2019s tourism, education and aviation sectors. Education-related travel services and personal travel services respectively ranked as Australia\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.dfat.gov.au/sites/default/files/trade-investment-glance-2020.pdf\">fourth and fifth largest exports</a> in 2018-19.

One is [Virgin] will bounce back in the way the government hopes. One is it won\u2019t bounce back and they\u2019ll let it fall in a heap.

  "<p>Hundreds of Rohingya Muslims, including children, have arrived at \u201ca de facto detention island\u201d in Bangladesh after being stranded at sea for weeks.</p> <p>Rights groups had warned that the refugees, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/02/let-the-boats-in-rohingya-refugees-plead-for-stranded-relatives-to-be-saved\">who ha</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/02/let-the-boats-in-rohingya-refugees-plead-for-stranded-relatives-to-be-saved\">d been turned away from other countries in the region</a>, were at risk of starvation and abuse by people traffickers. It is believed that other boats remain adrift.</p> <p>Bangladesh confirmed on Thursday that a boat carrying 280 people was being towed to Bhasan Char, an uninhabited silt island off the southern coast. The country\u2019s foreign minister, Abdul Momen, had earlier said that refugees rescued at sea would be sent to the island to prevent any risk of spreading the coronavirus to the sprawling camps in Cox\u2019s Bazar, where a million Rohingya live in cramped conditions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902XAiJHopvdo1F/\" data-alt=\"map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902XAiJHopvdo1F/\">map</a> </figure>  <p>Bangladesh, which has struggled to cope with the camps, planned to start moving refugees to Bhasan Char last December, and has built rows of concrete barracks to house about 100,000 people. The relocation was put on hold following an outcry from Rohingya community leaders and international agencies.</p> <p>Human rights groups say the island, which can be reached only by a three-hour boat journey, has no access to basic services and is vulnerable to sea-level rise and storm surges.</p> <p>Phil Robertson, the deputy director of Human Rights Watch\u2019s Asia division, said there was no need to send refugees to the island to be quarantined because the UN\u2019s refugee agency and other bodies had facilities set up for this purpose in Cox\u2019s Bazar. Instead, families should be reunited with missing relatives as quickly as possible.</p> <p>\u201cWhile everyone is appreciative that Bangladesh has brought forsaken Rohingya boats ashore, arbitrarily branding the passengers as \u2018new arrivals\u2019 and packing them off to a de facto detention island like Bhasan Char is not a rights respecting solution,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"feec6ef9eb9a100958e7e0974dc51b725f3a0aff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/feec6ef9eb9a100958e7e0974dc51b725f3a0aff/0_35_3811_2286/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Makeshift housing in the Cox\u2019s Bazar refugee camp\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Makeshift housing in the Cox\u2019s Bazar refugee camp.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allison Joyce/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many of the people on board are refugees who had been living in Cox\u2019s Bazar but who attempted to flee in search of a better life in Malaysia.</p> <p>\u201cThe Rohingya have repeatedly stated they do not want to be moved to Bahsan Char, but that is precisely what the Bangladesh government is forcing this group to do,\u201d Robertson said.</p> <p>Serazul Hoque said he believed his 14-year-old nephew, who had been missing for more than 50 days, is among those taken to Bhasan Char. Traffickers had told the family to pay a ransom to secure Nur Kamaal\u2019s release, but he called on Wednesday to say the Bangladeshi navy had stopped his boat and that all people on board were being taken to a different location.</p> <p>The family later heard news reports that refugees from the boat were being taken to Bhasan Char, but have not been able to confirm that Kamaal is among them.</p> <p>\u201cWe are worried about conditions there and how good the healthcare is,\u201d Hoque said. \u201cIf he comes back to his mother then his mother can take care of him \u2026 She is worrying for her son.

He said he hoped the government would reunite them with their families after the quarantine period.</p> <p>Mostofa said there were no words to describe the conditions on the boats, but that people risk the journey because there is no alternative. \u201cThey have no future [in refugee camps in Bangladesh], they cannot see any proper solution at all.\u201d</p> <p>It is not clear how many more boats are still at sea, but Bangladesh\u2019s navy and coast guard is on alert for others in the country\u2019s waters.</p> <p>The Bangladeshi authorities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/bangladesh-rescues-hundreds-of-rohingya-drifting-at-sea-for-nearly-two-months\">rescued a separate ship</a> last month, allowing about 400 emaciated people, mostly teenagers, to come ashore after spending two months at sea.

  "<p>Thanks to the ridiculous popularity of gin (even in these times, I\u2019m still discovering new ones), tonic has had a corresponding boom. But, assuming you can lay your hands on some, you can make equally refreshing, cheaper and less alcoholic drinks by mixing your tonic with sherry, white port or vermouth (the latter is also good with a splash of soda, by the way).</p> <p>Supermarkets do remarkably well-priced, own-label vermouths with which it\u2019s well worth experimenting. Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s, for example, both sell their own bianco for \u00a35.85 a litre, or much the same price as a still wine, and at just under 15%, it will go quite a bit further. A bianco with plenty of ice, a good slosh of soda (50:50) and a slice of orange is really reinvigorating. If you have a drier palate, I\u2019d recommend trying the more elegant, floral <strong>Chamb\u00e9ry</strong> (see panel below).</p> <p>I\u2019ve also been majorly into sherry and tonic, or \u201cShe &amp; T\u201d, lately, a slightly more sophisticated version of southern Spain\u2019s favourite summer drink, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/may/10/cocktail-of-the-week-olly-smiths-rebujito\">rebujito</a> (which is diluted with 7-Up or Sprite). You don\u2019t want to use the best or the driest sherry you have, but equally not the cheapest or sweetest, either. I\u2019ve been making mine with <strong><a href=\"https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/299817671\">Tesco\u2019s Finest Fino</a></strong> (\u00a36 a half bottle, 15%) ) \u2013 again, about half-and-half with a decent amount of ice (at least four or five cubes) and a slice of lemon. (Not a view universally shared, it appears: I see one customer has given it only one star on the supermarket\u2019s website.)</p> <p>In terms of using tonic as a mixer, it\u2019s worth being aware of the different levels of sugar in different brands \u2013 even slimline ones. Schweppes, for example, has just under 5g per 100ml in its standard Indian tonic water, while Fever-Tree has 7.1g, but no added sweeteners, while its \u201crefreshingly light\u201d version still has 2.9g sugar and you could easily be drinking twice that amount.</p> <p>For that reason, I often prefer diluting drinks with club soda or soda water (basically water to which sodium bicarbonate has been added), which is sugar-free. It definitely works better with cordials and shrubs, bitter drinks such as Campari and Aperol, and dry white wine \u2013 the classic spritzer \u2013 because it leaves the flavour of the underlying drink unchanged (and if you\u2019re clean out of soda, sparkling water can do much the same job). I think they work best with fruity whites and ros\u00e9s, rather than reds, though I\u2019m not averse to dropping a couple of ice cubes into a light red to chill it down. After all, there are no guests around at the moment to be horrified.</p> <h2>Five drinks to dilute</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"small spacer -- 12 pixels -- to separate the header  from the first wine bottle pic and its and text.\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;height: 1px; display: block; background: #DCDCDC; margin: 12px 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2b139a15655b172ea21a708147318c301e312f36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b139a15655b172ea21a708147318c301e312f36/0_0_1000_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gonzalez Byass Elegante fino sherry.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gonzalez Byass Elegante fino sherry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Gonzalez Byass Elegante Fino</strong> </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/gonzalez-byass-elegante-fino-sherry/064012-32499-32500\">\u00a39.99 Waitrose</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ocado.com/products/elegante-fino-sherry-gonzalez-byass-16771011\">Ocado</a>, 15%.</p> <p>A better sherry for a She &amp; T than the bracingly dry Tio Pepe, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not classy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"&lt;div style=&quot;height: 1px; display: block; background: #DCDCDC; margin: 32px 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;height: 1px; display: block; background: #DCDCDC; margin: 32px 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b6124a9bc52fc267909416e7f2b4589be82ac432\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6124a9bc52fc267909416e7f2b4589be82ac432/0_0_1000_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martini Non-alcoholic Vibrante copy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Martini Non-Alcoholic Vibrante</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ocado.com/products/martini-dolce-0-0-alcohol-free-italian-sparkling-459929011\">\u00a310 Ocado</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/p/53940/martini-vibrante-non-alcoholic-aperitif\">\u00a310.95 The Whisky Exchange</a>.</p> <p>Hooray for a sophisticated \u201capero\u201d with a proper touch of bitterness.

  "<p>Sea-level rise is faster than previously believed and could exceed 1 metre by the end of the century unless global emissions are reduced, according to a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41612-020-0121-5\">survey</a> of more than 100 specialists.</p> <p>Based on new knowledge of climate sensitivity and polar ice melt, the experts say coastal cities should prepare for an impact that will hit sooner than predicted by the United Nations and could reach as high as 5 metres by 2300.</p> <p>\u201cA global sea-level rise by several metres would be detrimental for many coastal cities such as Miami, New York, Alexandria, Venice, Bangkok, just to name a few well-known examples. Some may have to be abandoned altogether as they cannot be defended,\u201d said co-author Stefan Rahmstorf, from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.</p> <p>In the worst-case scenario \u2013 with rising emissions and global heating of 4.5C above pre-industrial levels \u2013 the study estimates the surface of the world\u2019s oceans in 2100 will be between 0.6 and 1.3 metres higher than today, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2017/nov/03/three-degree-world-cities-drowned-global-warming\">would potentially engulf areas </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2017/nov/03/three-degree-world-cities-drowned-global-warming\"> home to hundreds of millions of people</a>.</p> <p>By contrast, if humanity succeeds in cutting carbon dioxide and holding the increase in temperature to 2C, the rise would be a more manageable 0.5 metre.</p> <p>The figures for both pathways are more pessimistic than those outlined by the UN intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC), which predicts the worst possibility is a 1.1-metre rise by 2100.</p> <p>The gap reflects advances in climate science and differences in approach. The IPCC works largely through consensus among scientific working groups, which tends to produce relatively conservative estimates.</p> <p>By contrast, the new survey \u2013 published in the journal Climate and Atmospheric Science \u2013 aggregates the views of 106 specialists, who were chosen because they have published at least six peer-reviewed papers on the subject in major academic journals. As a result, the predictions are more representative of a range of views in the field.</p> <p>The higher estimates highlight growing concern about the world\u2019s two biggest ice sheets, in Antarctica and Greenland. Satellite data and on-the-ground measurements show these regions are melting faster than most computer models predicted. Many of the scientists said there was now greater understanding of the risks posed by marine ice-cliff instability, which can lead to the collapse of ice shelves.</p> <p>The study was led by scientists at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore with support from seven research institutions across the world, including Durham University in the UK, Tufts University in the US and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.</p> <p>The lead author, Prof Benjamin Horton of the university\u2019s Asian School of the Environment, said the research aimed to condense the growing mass of academic studies about sea-level projections into a simple overview. \u201cIt is useful to survey leading experts on the expected sea-level rise, which provides a broader picture of future scenarios and informs policymakers so they can prepare necessary measures,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The authors said the results showed how much warming \u2013 and sea-level rise \u2013 could be avoided if governments fulfilled their 2015 Paris climate agreement promises to cut emissions of the gases that are heating the planet. Most countries are far off reaching their goals.</p> <p>\u201cLike in the Covid pandemic, timing is critical to prevent devastation. If you wait until you already have a serious problem, then it is too late. Unlike with corona, sea-level rise cannot be stopped for many centuries or even millennia once ice sheets have been destabilised past their tipping points,\u201d Rahmstorf said.</p> <p>The coronavirus pandemic has temporarily slowed the discharge of carbon dioxide and methane because there are fewer cars on the road and industrial activity is lower. The <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/\">International Energy Agency</a> projects global fossil fuel emissions will decrease by 8% this year.</p> <p>But, without deeper structural changes, the reduction is likely to be temporary and will make little difference to the build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The Met Office predicted on Thursday carbon dioxide measurements at the Mauna Loa measuring station would rise 2.5 parts per million this year.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough emissions are reducing this year, this does not mean the build-up of CO2 in the atmosphere will reverse \u2013 it will just be slightly slower\u201d the Met Office\u2019s chief CO2 forecaster, <a href=\"https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/people/richard-betts\">Richard Betts</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.metoffice.gov.uk/2020/05/07/coronavirus-will-impact-the-atmospheric-co2-record-but-not-enough-to-slow-global-heating/\">said in a blogpost</a>.</p> <p>\u201cAn analogy is filling a bath from a tap \u2013 it\u2019s like we are turning down the tap, but because we are not turning off the tap completely, the water level is still rising.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Every day the president of the Navajo nation provides a coronavirus update, and every day there\u2019s more bad news.</p> <p>The Native American tribe now has the highest per-capita Covid-19 infection rate after only New York and New Jersey, and the spread is not slowing.</p> <p>\u201cWe are doing our very best to flatten the curve with the very limited resources we have on the Navajo nation,\u201d president Jonathan Nez told the Guardian. \u201cThe first citizens of this country were once again pushed aside by the most powerful government in the world \u2026 but now that we\u2019re in the headlines, US citizens are finally realising the deplorable conditions our people live in. We\u2019re fed up. This has got to end.\u201d</p> <p>As of Thursday, there were 2,757 confirmed cases for the Navajo nation \u2013 whose rural territory stretches 27,000 sq miles over the south-western Colorado plateau across Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. The official death toll stood at 88 <strong>\u2013 </strong>higher than 13 states \u2013 though the actual number of fatalities is likely to be much higher as the sickest patients requiring ventilators and intensive care are transferred to state hospitals.</p> <p>The virus has spread rapidly among the Navajo since the first case was confirmed at the end of March, even though the tribal government was among the first to issue a stay-at-home order, lock down schools and business, and impose evening and weekend curfews.</p> <p>Despite the unfolding crisis, it wasn\u2019t until Wednesday that the nation received its portion, around $600m, of federal coronavirus relief funding. It came six weeks after it was promised and a week after the government missed a congressional deadline for distribution, and only after suing the federal government over who is eligible for the money.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have the resources of New York and New Jersey and yet it\u2019s taken six weeks for tribes to see this money,\u201d said Nez. \u201cThe federal response has been too slow.\u201d</p> <p>This slow, inadequate response by the government is nothing new.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NNPrezNez/status/1255589484722302977\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Today we distributed food, water, fire wood, cleaning products, masks, and more to elderly and high-risk families in Pueblo Pintado and Torreon, NM to help fight COVID-19!

It\u2019s been extremely challenging to quarantine infected individuals because of inadequate basic infrastructure and widespread overcrowding, according to tribal council delegate Amber Kanazbah Crotty.</p> <p>In part, the latter is down to cultural norms which mean multiple generations often live together, but it\u2019s also due to chronic housing shortages, complex federal restrictions on construction, high unemployment and poverty on the reservation.</p> <p>In tribal areas, 16% of American Indian and Alaska Native households live in overcrowded conditions \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.huduser.gov/portal/pdredge/pdr-edge-research-022117.html\">eight times </a><a href=\"https://www.huduser.gov/portal/pdredge/pdr-edge-research-022117.html\">the rate of the rest of the population.</a></p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have enough hospital beds for individuals to recover, so we\u2019ve had to send people home where the virus is spread,\u201d said Nez. After multiple family outbreaks, up to 150 coronavirus patients will now be temporarily housed in three converted community gyms, instead of being sent home.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just the quantity of homes, it\u2019s also about quality. About 30% of people do not have electricity, and so cook and heat their homes by burning coal or wood which irritates the lungs \u2013 potentially exacerbating the risk of severe Covid-19. That\u2019s on top of high rates of lung disease caused by decades of exposure to uranium mines.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a2e54c3afefb2ddd965e779ac039b0bac73ec4db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2e54c3afefb2ddd965e779ac039b0bac73ec4db/0_179_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A road sign outside Bloomfield, New Mexico, warns Navajos to stay home during their nation\u2019s 8pm to 5am curfew to slow the spread of the coronavirus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A road sign outside Bloomfield, New Mexico, warns Navajos to stay home during their nation\u2019s 8pm to 5am curfew to slow the spread of the coronavirus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Hay/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In addition, depending on the season, as many as 40% do not have running water, according to research by the John Hopkins Centre for American Indian Health (CAIH). And the vast reservation is a food desert, with only 13 grocery stores, which means some people travel up to 150 miles to shop.</p> <p>\u201cSocial distancing isn\u2019t simple, when people have to move to survive,\u201d said Kanazbah Crotty.</p> <p>As a result, the average age for coronavirus cases among the Navajo is just 45 years old, according to Crystalyne Curley, spokeswoman for the operational command centre.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, perhaps, the lack of running water increases the risk of infectious diseases. But the crisis is also linked to childhood obesity \u2013 the number one risk factor for type 2 diabetes, which is seven times more common in native youth than the general population, according to Dr Allison Barlow, the CAIH director.</p> <p>\u201cThe clash of historic traumas, accumulated stressors and poor social determinants cannot be underestimated in what we\u2019re seeing now with coronavirus. There\u2019s such a complex constellation of risks piled up and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/20/coronavirus-outbreak-us-native-americans-health-services\">chronic underfunding </a>is part of that puzzle,\u201d said Barlow.</p> <p>According to Laura Hammitt, an infectious diseases specialist, the emerging epidemiological data suggests Covid-19 infections are more common and more severe in younger Navajo people than the general population. This is partly linked to underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease and respiratory conditions \u2013 which are more prevalent among younger Native Americans than non-Natives. The average age of those who have died is 66 \u2013 significantly younger than in the US as a whole.</p> <p>The tribe continues to struggle to obtain enough testing kits and PPE, especially gowns and masks, and has been forced to rely on<a href=\"https://twitter.com/NNPrezNez/status/1256387754637750273\"> private donors including the actor Sean Penn.</a> Contact tracing is also still very limited, though a training program is now under way.</p> <p>Still, Nez has come under pressure from some <a href=\"https://www.azfamily.com/news/mayor-of-page-accused-of-racist-social-media-comment-toward-navajo-nation-president/article_e2e6efd6-8db4-11ea-a8a2-7f6976d702f6.html\">local mayors to</a> reopen tourist attractions, as states look towards easing lockdown restrictions despite public health warnings</p> <p>Nez added: \u201cLots of states are risking second spikes by not following professional advice.

AFL players, league confirms</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>From AAP: </p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>The AFL won\u2019t mandate its players to have a flu vaccination ahead of the season resumption and will leave the decision up to footballers and their respective club doctors.</p> \n   <p>NRL players are required to either have the flu vaccination or sign waiver forms as rugby league works towards a planned 28 May season restart.</p> \n   <p>But the AFL maintains flu shots will be at the discretion of players and club staff, not a league-wide policy.</p> \n   <p>\u201cWhile the AFL recommends players and officials to get a yearly flu shot, the decision is ultimately that of the player and club doctor as to whether they wish to do so,\u201d an AFL spokesperson said.</p> \n   <p>On Friday morning, Gold Coast Suns captain <strong>David Swallow</strong> questioned whether flu vaccinations should be compulsory in the AFL if players weren\u2019t comfortable with them.</p> \n   <p>The NRL had amended its original waiver form on Thursday after several players refused to sign it on religious or conscientious grounds.</p> \n   <p>On Friday, three Gold Coast Titans players, including <strong>Bryce Cartwrigh</strong>t, were stood down by the NRL for refusing to take the flu shot, on the advice of Queensland health officials.</p> \n   <p>The other two players were believed to be <strong>Nathan Peats</strong> and <strong>Brian Kelly</strong>.</p> \n   <p>Peats later said on Twitter he was not anti-vaccination and had avoided the flu jab due to an adverse experience while at South Sydney back in 2012 \u2013 but was now planning to have the shot on Friday afternoon.</p> \n   <p>Earlier on Friday, Prime Minister <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> backed any decision by state governments to apply a \u2018no jab, no play\u2019 policy to the NRL.<br></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time

plan</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Australia\u2019s tourism industry has cautiously welcomed the national cabinet\u2019s roadmap for easing coronavirus restrictions, pointing to the possibility of domestic travel from next month. </p> \n  <p>\u201cAll the signs are pointing to green shoots of domestic travel from June,\u201d Australian Tourism Industry Council executive director <strong>Simon Westaway</strong> said, according to AAP. </p> \n  <p>Westaway said while there was a long way to go before tourism returned to normal, members had already expressed their excitement about the plan for the way out.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s really important about today is that there has been a level of certainty put out there,\u201d he said</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe level of uncertainty has been a big part of the angst for our industry.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But he said the biggest challenge facing tourism operators was the ongoing closure of state borders.</p> \n  <p>He said if businesses in the sector could be given confidence about when they would reopen, that would help stimulate its recovery.</p> \n  <p>Despite the easing of restrictions in some states from next week, Westaway said he didn\u2019t expect every 4WD would be on the road straightaway.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI think people are going to be a bit circumspect to a degree,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI think

said in a statement: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>It is a failing of the Morrison Government that the Banking Royal Commission recommendations were not implemented in full before

recommendations.</em></p> \n   <p><em>Labor calls for the Royal Commission implementation delays to be limited to no more than 6 months.</em></p> \n   <p><em>The Government resisted the Banking Royal Commission for years, voted against it 26 times and have dragged their feet on implementation.</em></p> \n   <p><em>After receiving the Banking Royal Commission\u2019s final report, Prime Minister Morrison and Treasurer Frydenberg took six months to release an implementation timetable.</em></p> \n   <p><em>One year after the report was on their desks, the Government had only completed 6 out of the 76 recommendations made by Commissioner Hayne.</em></p> \n   <p><em>Labor acknowledges the role that the banks are playing in the current crisis.</em></p> \n   <p><em>We support a strong banking system and the recent measures that have added needed liquidity and financial support during COVID-19.</em></p> \n   <p><em>But the Australian public also have an expectation that the Banking Royal Commission recommendations will be implemented.</em></p> \n   <p><em>With almost half the workforce on JobKeeper or JobSeeker, consumers need to be sure that they are protected from financial misconduct.</em></p> \n   <p><em>We agree with consumer groups who wrote to the Treasurer on 16 April 2020 expressing concerns.</em></p> \n   <p><em>While there is a reasonable case for a six-month extension to deadlines, the Australian community still expects to see action on the Banking Royal Commission.</em></p> \n   <p><em>Australians just want fair treatment from our financial institutions.</em></p> \n   <p><em>It is Josh Frydenberg\u2019s job to make sure that still happens.</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time

  "<p>While most would name Colombia as the home of South America\u2019s forward-thinking club scene, neighbouring Ecuador has quietly been carving out its own dancefloor identity in recent years. The country has produced breakout talents such as DJ Nicola Cruz and home-grown labels like ZZK and Wonderwheel Recordings, operating under the social restrictions of a largely Catholic state and in the midst of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/03/ecuador-state-of-emergency-fuel-subsidies-protest\">devastating austerity</a> measures. Most of its key players reside in Quito, and bring together a community at the capital\u2019s inclusive nights, including Cruz\u2019s La Sagraria.</p> <p>Often marked by downtempo, undulating house rhythms and samples of Andean pan flutes and instruments such as the lute-like <em>charango</em>, their output is organic-sounding. Yet Place: Ecuador, a new charity compilation, showcases a grittier and more kinetic side to the scene. It\u2019s the fourth release in New York label Air Texture\u2019s location-specific charity series (previous editions have covered Georgia, Colombia and the Netherlands), benefiting the indigenous Waorani people\u2019s legal battles against the Ecuadorian government\u2019s sale of their land for mineral rights.</p> <p>Where Air Texture\u2019s previous compilations were propulsive and dancefloor-oriented, Place: Ecuador offers a broader take on the country\u2019s fluid musical identity. Productions jitter from Discwoman affiliate Riobamba\u2019s broken-beat explorations on S\u00e1calo to duo Cruzloma\u2019s use of Mestizo melodies on their shuffling polyrhythmic number Supay and Patamamba\u2019s ambient cacophony of field recordings. Where Place really hits its stride is in the kinds of eerily fragmented techno popularised by the likes of Hyperdub boss Kode 9 and Objekt. This comes through in producer Lascive Dopamine\u2019s big room track D\u00eda Cero, Zoroxxe\u2019s dubby Tigrillo, and Nieves\u2019 two-stepping Invo.</p> <p>It\u2019s an effective, authentic approach, that wisely avoids the suggestion that Ecuador\u2019s club music is dominated by any one sound. By showcasing this distinctive variety, it offers a map for listeners to undertake their own, deeper explorations.</p> <h2>Also out this month</h2> <p>A wonderful meeting of Ghanaian singers and Jamaican reggae on the roots album Nsie Nsie by the duo <strong>Y-Bayani</strong><strong> and Baby Naa</strong> with their optimistically named Band of Enlightenment, Reason and Love.

These killer games of hide-and-seek usually involve sniper rifles, some bushcraft ingenuity and at least one overconfident antagonist in fancy combat gear realising just a little too late that there is a reason why most supposed sportsmen stick to hunting animals. (They don\u2019t shoot back.)</p> <p>Drill down through all these lethal cinematic safaris \u2013 including the Ice-T-starring Surviving the Game in 1994 or sci-fi variants like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/02/predator-review-arnold-schwarzenegger-john-mctiernan-thriller-alien\">Predator</a> in 1987 \u2013 and you eventually hit the bedrock. The Most Dangerous Game is a brisk and at times brutal B-movie that usefully codified some of the comforting rituals of a good cinema manhunt, notably batting around some quasi-philosophical theories about the charged relationship between predator and prey.</p> <p>It was the first screen adaptation of Richard Connell\u2019s award-winning 1924 short story \u2013 a pop sensation when it was originally published \u2013 and for the most part sticks closely to its source. Rather than diving headlong into the jungle, the first half is essentially a claustrophobic gothic horror story.</p> <p>Notorious big-game hunter Robert Rainsford (Joel McCrea) is the sole survivor of a shipwreck in shark-infested waters, eventually washing up on a mysterious island\u2019s shore. There he discovers a gloomy-looking castle lorded over by exiled Cossack count Zaroff (Leslie Banks) and his towering mute man-servant Ivan (Noble Johnson). Zaroff\u2019s fastidious and self-regarding manner paired with a larger-than-life henchman feels like a proto-Bond double-act: squint and it could be Moonraker\u2019s Hugo Drax and Jaws. In one of the film\u2019s rare comic moments, stony-faced Ivan is ordered to smile and delivers a robotic death\u2019s head grin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e39ed210f1be1e78b9f4216f059a37ac729d2f92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e39ed210f1be1e78b9f4216f059a37ac729d2f92/106_76_2747_1952/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Most Dangerous Game: a sturdy, punchy little tale.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"711\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Most Dangerous Game: a sturdy, punchy little tale.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Grant Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The tuxedoed Zaroff is a brittle but seemingly gracious host, eager to wax lyrical about his lifelong search for new hunting challenges and the prized Tatar war bow mounted on his wall. Over vodka shots, Rainsford meets fellow castaways Eve (Fay Wray) and her lush brother Martin (Robert Armstrong) but their dinner party smalltalk is underpinned by a palpable sense of unease, particularly whenever Zaroff\u2019s off-limits trophy room is mentioned.</p> <p>After the loquacious Martin goes missing, Eve recruits Rainsford in the wee small hours to find out exactly what lies behind the stout trophy room door, and their discoveries are surprisingly gruesome (this was before the 1934 Motion Picture Production Code tamped down some of the industry\u2019s trashier instincts). With poor Martin definitively out of the picture, Zaroff challenges his fellow hunter Rainsford to survive in the island wilds with little more than a woodsman\u2019s knife and a head start.</p> <p>The second half of the film comprises a tense stalking sequence as Rainsford and Eve contrive to outwit Zaroff as he tracks them while wielding his prized Tatar war bow. Even almost nine decades later, it remains a sturdy, punchy little tale that actually becomes even more enjoyable when you realise how much it overlaps with another cinema benchmark. In a thrifty move that Blumhouse would surely appreciate, the impressive jungle sets of The Most Dangerous Game were also used for King Kong a year later, while the overlapping cast and crew included stars Wray, Armstrong and Johnson, producer/directors Merian C Cooper and Ernest B Schoedsack and screenwriter James Creelman. King Kong may still be held up as a timeless classic, but its screen sibling has arguably inspired more imitators, be they doggedly faithful or opportunistic cash-ins.</p> <p>Connell\u2019s original short story passed into the public domain on 1 January this year, which perhaps explains why there is an unloved new version starring Liam Hemsworth and Christoph Waltz on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/06/quibi-streaming-review-short-form-tv\">fledgling Quibi network of bite-size content</a>.

But hunting down the original isn\u2019t just taking in some schlocky B-movie.

  "<p>At the beginning of March, thousands of refugees gathered in the shadow of the Pazarkule border gate in Turkey after President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan said he would \u201copen the gate\u201d to Europe.</p> <p>The move was a reaction to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/28/nato-turkey-syria-airstrikes-russia-un-jens-stoltenberg\">killing of 33 Turkish soldiers in Idlib province</a> on 28 February and designed to exert pressure on the EU and Nato to support its military operation in northern Syria.</p> <p>Many boarded buses to Pazarkule \u2013 some organised by Turkish authorities from Istanbul \u2013 others walked.

She hoped to find a way into Europe and on to Switzerland where her sister is a political refugee.</p> <p>When she arrived, however, she quickly realised the closed borders meant she was simply part of a bigger game by the Turkish government. \u201cI understood we were being used,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Greek forces used tear gas and stun grenades to repel people trying to cross. Turkey claims 150,000 people crossed the land and sea borders during this period while Greece puts the official numbers at fewer than 3,500.</p> <p>In the following weeks, Rima and the thousands who remained in Pazarkule went from one nightmare to another as the coronavirus outbreak gripped Europe. On the night of 26 March, Turkish forces burned the tents of those living in the makeshift migrant camp and forced them on to buses, driving them thousands of miles across the country to quarantine camps.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.lighthousereports.nl/#home\">Lighthouse Reports</a> followed Rima and 29 others on their journeys from Pazarkule: tracking and verifying testimonies through apps, live streams and social media updates.</p> <p>The investigation has shown how, after leaving the quarantine camps, some people ended up on the streets of Izmir. Others, including children, were put into a detention facility in Ankara. Some of the Syrians have been threatened with deportation to \u201csafe zones\u201d in northern Syria. These people are what remains of Turkey\u2019s \u201cleverage\u201d over the EU. Their stories are just a handful of those who risked and lost much at the European border in March.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab39d53d55fee0f477e5216d9848b51fa6dbc645\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab39d53d55fee0f477e5216d9848b51fa6dbc645/0_0_4032_2688/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Syrian refugees living in the bus terminal at Izmir in west Turkey, 14 April 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Syrian refugees living in the bus terminal at Izmir, western Turkey, 14 April 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emre Tazegul/Depo Photos via ZUMA Wire/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After Rima watched her tent burn she was taken to a quarantine camp in Malatya. She estimates that she was one of about 2,300 people bussed more than 1,000km (620 miles) away from the border on the eastern side of Turkey. They had no choice but to go, she says: \u201c[Turkish forces] threatened us with weapons.\u201d</p> <p>Rima says that there was minimal food provision and medical care in Malatya. They were finally released from quarantine on 16 April and dropped off in the north-eastern Trabzon province. A group of 50, including Rima, who had no money for onward travel were then picked up by local authorities and taken to a detention facility in Ankara 800km away.</p> <p>Videos she shared show women screaming and children crying as they arrive at the facility. Rima says everyone initially refused to get off the bus when they realised they were about to be detained again.</p> <p>\u201cThey treated us like detainees and criminals,\u201d she says. She managed to keep her phone although others had theirs taken away. \u201cI could communicate and document what people suffered in this prison.\u201d Photos she shared show babies and children sitting on bunk beds. They went on hunger strike in protest at the conditions and Rima says there was no milk formula for the babies.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They forced us with batons to give up our dream and get on the bus</p> <footer> <cite>Ibrahim, Syrian refugee</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s your president who announced to us that the borders are open, your president!

He said the threat to open the borders to refugees is the \u201cAchilles heel of the west\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cErdo\u011fan is a pragmatist politician,\u201d he said. \u201cThose people who died, [were] wounded, became miserable, lost their belongings, are just casualties for Erdo\u011fan. He can construct such a game again.\u201d</p> <p>Ibrahim*, 41, is another Syrian who tried his luck at Pazarkule. He used to paint walls in the rural areas outside the city of Latakia and was imprisoned in 2016 after being accused of delivering medical equipment to rebels.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan\u2019s announcement gave Ibrahim hope he might be able to join his wife, who had made the journey to Germany while he was in prison.</p> <p>Ibhrahim was robbed of his belongings near Pazarkule by a gang of six people. After an unsuccessful attempt to cross they went to the makeshift camp at Pazarkule. \u201cWe fell into silence and here another form of suffering began,\u201d he says.</p> <p>When the quarantine was announced, he was forced on a bus. \u201cThey forced us with batons to give up our dream and get on the bus, after they lied to us that we will return after the end of the quarantine period,\u201d he said. He was then taken to an old university dormitory in Edirne where he had to give up his phone.</p> <p>The food in this makeshift quarantine facility was minimal. \u201cWe called it samples,\u201d he says. People in quarantine were threatened with deportation and beaten by Turkish authorities after a protest at the conditions, he says. \u201cMy friend is still suffering from injuries on his hand.\u201d</p> <p>Ibrahim says he has spent about $1,700 (\u00a31,380) and exhausted nearly all his finances on the attempt to cross the border into Europe.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ceee888628570042d70013913ced48de7c551df3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ceee888628570042d70013913ced48de7c551df3/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Asylum seekers wait to enter Greece at Pazarkule\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Asylum seekers in their makeshift camp wait to enter Greece at Pazarkule border crossing, 6 March 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elif Ozturk/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even after their quarantine, the refugees who had been at Pazarkule found themselves in the middle of political game-playing. Unverified stories appeared in Greek media at the beginning of April suggesting that Turkey was planning to send Covid-19 positive migrants to Europe. One story in Greek newspaper Kathimerini was headlined: \u201cTurkey pushing Covid-infected migrants to cross into Greece, officials believe.\u201d</p> <p>Similar articles appeared in Greek media outlets ERT, Mega TV, Ethnos and Proto Thema. Proto Thema used a screenshot from the video of Mohammad, a refugee from Hamah province. This was presented without context to bolster claims that refugees with coronavirus were gathering at the border. Mohammad\u2019s video, however, had a caption which explained that everyone he was with had just been released from quarantine and did not have coronavirus. Mohammad, who does not want his full name used, has never had the virus.</p> <p>For those who tried and failed to get to Europe at the Pazarkule border gate, the future is unknown. Rima is now homeless and staying with friends in Ankara. She cannot envisage earning enough money to build a life there and fears deportation to northern Syria. \u201cThere is no future, no protection, or hope,\u201d she says.</p> <p>For Ibrahim, staying with friends in Istanbul, Pazarkule is representative of the peace and security he and so many Syrian refugees have so far been denied. \u201cThis is just how one of the attempts in our search for a life with dignity has been aborted,\u201d he says. \u201cFor me this is the story of Pazarkule.\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian contacted representatives in the Turkish Health Ministry to clarify details about the evacuation of Pazarkule, the camps and the Covid-19 response but received no reply.</p> <p>*<em>Names have been changed to protect identity.</em></p> <p><em>Reporting for this article was supported by the Borders Newsroom at Lighthouse Reports. </em><em> </em><em>https://www.lighthousereports.nl/</em><em> </em><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p>",

  "<p>In making his landmark post-Brexit speech in February under Sir James Thornhill\u2019s baroque painted ceiling in the Royal Hospital, Greenwich, Boris Johnson believed he had found the perfect setting to paint his own picture of Britain charting a new course as a free-trading, independent, open and liberal nation.</p> <p>Like the painting above him, eulogising the triumph of William and Mary over the popish and tyrannical French, Johnson\u2019s speech was an optimistic and patriotic piece of work. It offered a distinctive vision of British prosperity and diplomatic superiority.</p> <p>The speech had no hint that the world he described, and Britain\u2019s place in it, was under any existential threat. But the past three months have left UK foreign policy thinkers suddenly searching in the fog for Britain\u2019s future role in this changed world.</p> <p>Indeed, as the UK prepares to celebrate VE Day, the institutional order created by the west following the defeat of Germany, and on which Johnson\u2019s vision rested, seems after 75 years finally to be coming apart. Those institutions, in which the UK thrived, are either paralysed, or a battleground.</p> <p>Covid-19, an invisible enemy, but deadlier than the blitz, has exacerbated and accelerated trends recalibrating risk, revealing new Great Powers and placing all UK diplomatic alliances under scrutiny. Sir Simon McDonald, the foreign office senior mandarin, says it is a \u201cwatershed moment for humanity\u201d, and a chance for \u201ca world reset\u201d.</p> <p>Ministers have postponed the foreign and security policy review, due to have been published this autumn, to devote time to fighting the virus. Yet the UK\u2019s most senior diplomats, including at foreign office executive committee level, are already examining Britain\u2019s strategic posture.</p> <p>The question of the UK\u2019s greatest ally, the US, currently, in the words of the former foreign secretary David Miliband, \u201ca flagship for dysfunction\u201d can be set aside until the US elections.</p> <p>For most British analysts, the most pressing foreign policy question for the UK will be its relations with China. Will the divisions between the US and China deepen so much that, regardless of the outcome of the US election, all nations, including the UK, are sucked into its vortex, requiring Britain to choose? If so, multilateral solutions become harder.</p> <p>Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, has spoken of the need for \u201ca deep dive\u201d into the role of China, adding vaguely: \u201cWe cannot have business as usual.\u201d The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has backed an inquiry.</p> <p>The mood towards Beijing on the Tory benches, already sceptical, is turning ugly and suggests at minimum that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/29/johnson-faces-tory-rebellion-over-huawei-5g-plans-for-britain\">the Huawei deal</a> will not survive in its current form, placing other Chinese infrastructure projects in the UK at question.</p> <p>\u201cWe are all paying the price for Beijing\u2019s decision to ignore the science, prioritise trade \u2013 and put the rest of the world\u2019s health at risk,\u201d says Tom Tugendhat, the liberal internationalist chair of the foreign affairs select committee. His committee is relentlessly pressing the foreign office for clear strategy on China. It\u2019s clear that his committee will at minimum demand the UK adopt takeover rules that sees Chinese investment as a security risk.</p> <p>Nick Timothy, Theresa May\u2019s former special adviser and a long-term China sceptic, has lambasted \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2015/oct/27/where-does-britain-draw-the-line-with-saudi-arabia-and-china\">David Cameron\u2019s Operation Kowtow</a>\u201d and identified the chief culprit as George Osborne and the Treasury. He says: \u201cJust as Harold Macmillan had perceived that, as British power declined, we should play Athens to America\u2019s Rome, Mr Osborne thought he could pull off a geopolitical pivot that would strengthen Britain for decades to come.\u201d</p> <p>Echoing the US State Department, Timothy adds: \u201cIt is surely now obvious that China is also a strategic rival to the west as a whole. It is an autocratic and oppressive state, with wildly different values and interests to our own. Its policy towards Asia, Africa and elsewhere is inevitably imperialistic. And its modus operandi \u2013 setting debt traps for countries to gain leverage over them and engaging in mass industrial espionage \u2013 is a danger to our interests and those of our allies.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09077ac6cc0d9df384c3f896ca2985860032d0f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09077ac6cc0d9df384c3f896ca2985860032d0f6/0_141_3300_1980/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Soldiers help to carry out Covid-19 testing in Plymouth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Soldiers help to carry out Covid-19 testing in Plymouth.

The Foreign Office is urging caution, making the case for keeping a few bridges unburnt. The former foreign secretary Lord Hague told Policy Exchange: \u201cWe can\u2019t solve global problems without China. And global problems are some of our most pressing and obviously most existential. The Covid-19 crisis is an example of such a dramatic world crisis. So we can\u2019t be dependent on China, but we can\u2019t be without a framework of cooperation with China.\u201d</p> <p>McDonald agrees: \u201cThere is no problem that the world faces today that can be addressed, still less solved, without the active participation of China.\u201d</p> <p>Miliband also argues that a balance needs striking. He says he has no illusions about China. \u201cIt is obvious that the Chinese state is being very confident in its response to Covid-19, describing it both as a success and the product of its one-party system. Their message is being effectively delivered \u2013 through aid supplies and diplomatic outreach around the world. It is much harsher than before, with crackdowns at home and favour-buying abroad.\u201d</p> <p>But that does not mean cooperation with China should be seen as appeasement, Miliband argues. \u201cWe need to worry about a democratic recession, and the debate about whether democracies or autocracies coped best in this crisis is materially relevant to lives around the world, but it is really important this debate does end up excluding the need for institutions that encompass both democratic and autocratic regimes.\u201d<br> China is not just a seminar discussion for the UK. Britain needs China on board if its chairmanship of the UN climate change conference, set for Glasgow in November but now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/uk-likely-to-postpone-cop26-un-climate-talks-glasgow-coronavirus\">delayed until the middle of next year</a>, is to be a success.</p> <p>Even now the best UK diplomats are pressing China to adopt bolder carbon emission targets for 2030. McDonald has said he hopes the coronavirus crisis will lead to greater Chinese ambition. \u201cBuild back better\u201d has long been part of UK disaster relief thinking, and has now become the slogan of those preparing green post-coronavirus stimulation packages.</p> <p>But there are countervailing forces. Many of the building blocks for Glasgow have been removed. An EU-China meet-up scheduled for September and seen as a moment for China to float new targets has been cancelled. A Chinese-hosted conference on biodiversity, a chance to discuss carbon sinks and nature based solutions, has <a href=\"http://sdg.iisd.org/events/2020-un-biodiversity-conference/\">also been postponed</a>, while governments are under pressure to save industries such as aviation.</p> <p>Above all, even under a Democrat presidency, relations between China and the US will be on a downward curve, making a climate change agreement more difficult. Tim Benton, head of the Chatham House energy and environment programme, foresees an uphill task for Britain\u2019s diplomats. He argues that: \u201cAny tension that undermines the existing international architecture \u2013 whether it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/wto\">WTO</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">WHO</a>, UNFCCC [the UN framework convention on climate change] \u2013 anything that creates stress is going to get in the way of reaching climate change targets.</p> <p>\u201cYou can imagine there is so much to-ing and fro-ing between major powers vying for their own nationalistic interest that climate change just gets pushed further down the agenda because economic reconstruction is seen as so much more important.\u201d</p> <p>Economic reconstruction leads to the Brexit question. For many diplomats, the thought of piling a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/04/no-more-deal-or-no-deal-no-10s-brexit-diktat-to-foreign-office\">no-deal Brexit</a> on to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-jobs-bailout-treasury-resolution-foundation-wage-subsidy-scheme\">\u00a3300bn coronavirus hit</a> to the UK economy looks less like an act of self-harm, and more like a death wish. McDonald, speaking to the foreign affairs select committee, held out the faint hope that it was still an open question whether the PM might yet revisit the timetable.</p> <p>Robin Niblett, Chatham House director, senses Johnson will not delay, but instead look for a short-form agreement. \u201cIf you think that by the summer, the politics may get nastier with inquests about how we got into quite such a mess, and the money for what was called levelling up has been diverted to survival \u2013 the survival of businesses and the economy \u2013 then Johnson may feel politically he has to follow through on Brexit. Once you delay, you lose your agency and Brexit is about agency, as much as it is about control.\u201d</p> <p>Miliband predicts the UK and the EU might settle for an outline deal that leaves details to be negotiated.</p> <p>Either way, the integrated review will have to work with changed assumptions about both resources and security. \u201cThe budget for global Britain promises to be brutal,\u201d Niblett says.</p> <p>In the UK, growth is due to fall 7% this year. The World Trade Organization sees world trade declining by between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-putting-world-on-track-for-new-great-depression-says-who\">13% and 34%.</a> Covid\u2019s lasting legacy may be a switch away from just-in-time imports towards shorter supply chains and national sourcing.</p> <p>In this deglobalising world, Johnson\u2019s promise in Greenwich to be \u201ca superhero champion\u201d of free trade looks incongruous. The US \u2013 with which the UK seeks to sign a signature free-trade deal \u2013 is in free fall.</p> <p>Yet Johnson fervently believes that the coronavirus only strengthens the case for a free-trade deal. Any scrap of extra growth becomes important.</p> <p>At the same time, definitions of security are in flux. In the view of Professor Malcolm Chalmers, deputy director of the defence thinktank the Royal United Services Institute, the virus ranks alongside the cold war or 9/11 in terms of its security implications. The original concept of the walled state as protector has been reasserted, but the case for traditional defence spending has weakened.</p> <p>The army has had its role in the UK crisis, but the aircraft carrier has proved irrelevant, acting as much as an incubator as a shield from the virus. If the new stealth bomber is a pathogen, vaccines are the new missile defence system.</p> <p>In a post-coronavirus comprehensive spending review it will be health and not defence that will be first in the queue for the distribution of dwindling resources, Chalmers suggests.</p> <p>Beatrice Heuser, professor of international relations at Glasgow University, predicts defence officials \u201cwill have to cook their books like hell to reach the Nato target of spending at 2% of GDP\u201d.</p> <p>There is a final issue for Britain: relevance. Many analysts also fear that the UK\u2019s credibility as a leading convening power on the whole nexus of issues of the climate crisis, global health and development has taken a hit by its performance over coronavirus.</p> <p>Bill Gates may right to say that no country is likely to get an A grade for its pandemic preparedness, but judging by the European press the UK is currently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/complacent-uk-draws-global-criticism-for-covid-19-response-boris-johnson\">near the bottom of the class</a>, labelled, rightly or wrongly, as leading on \u201cherd immunity\u201d and then abandoning the policy.</p> <p>Niblett argues that \u201cBrexit was such a shock to people that thought Britain was pragmatic and had a sense of its national interest. Now the almost wilful lack of preparation over coronavirus makes it feel like Britain just assumed it was separate, an island off the coast of Europe, and it has discovered it is not. It does play into a lethal combination of incompetence and hubris that has been used against Britain for a while now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"474b8ea51dc251dd3a9480feb52b244383b0b4c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/474b8ea51dc251dd3a9480feb52b244383b0b4c7/0_182_5981_3589/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson Visits a laboratory in Bedford in early March\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson visits a laboratory in Bedford in early March.

Even though our scientific and university calling card remains unparalleled, the NHS was held up to a mirror and it has been shown at best to be underfunded. We could be put into an Anglo\u2013US box of just-in-time living, and that seems less worthy of imitation. Soft power is all about attraction and people wishing to imitate you.\u201d</p> <p>Miliband also issues a warning that Britain will need to be \u201cbrutally honest about its mistakes or risk irrelevance\u201d.</p> <p>He sees one cause of optimism. \u201cThis may be the first global crisis where it is British universities seeking a vaccine, British companies developing contact tracing apps, British NGOs framing global connections. It is these institutions that may lead government rather than government provide the lead.\u201d</p> <p>The Foreign Office is also urging Johnson to recognise there is a hard-won reputation on which he can draw. As far back as 2008, the UK government published a cross-government white paper entitled \u201chealth is global\u201d. The paper argued that health should be seen as \u201can agent for good in foreign policy\u201d so the UK was in at the birth of health diplomacy.</p> <p>The UK may have been trounced in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/23/who-elects-first-ever-african-director-general-after-tense-vote-tedros-adhanom-ghebreyesus\">election to head the WHO in 2017</a>, but there are influential Brits all around the international health set-up. UK\u2019s strong medical research base, large aid budget and an interventionist mindset gives Johnson the platform from which to engage. The natural instinct within Whitehall is to be a player, but it will require leadership that only a prime minister can provide.</p> <p>Greenwich, according to Nicholas Hawksmoor, writing in 1728, was chosen as the site of Royal Hospital because it was located on the bend in the river \u201cin the View of all the World and in the Sight of the Grand Emporium London\u201d.</p> <p>The nation\u2019s wealth and global outlook were seen as interdependent. It will be up to Johnson to decide if and how he honours that tradition.</p>",

granting pratique (the approval to dock), but had concerns over the occupational health and safety of sending its employees onto the ship to help it dock.</p> \n<p>Emma Fensom, the acting CEO of NSW Port Authority, also told the inquiry she reached out to the Australian Border Force to provide safety advice to her employees for boarding ships with potential coronavirus.</p> \n<p>Fensom told the inquiry that in February she emailed the head of the ABF, Michael Outram, to make contact, and was transferred to multiple other border force officers.</p> \n<p>The inquiry heard earlier that Butchart had initially cancelled the ship\u2019s permission to book on 18 March, and <a href=\"he%20offered%20to%20\u201cturn%20[the%20ship]%20around\">he also offered to \u201cturn [the ship] around\u201d</a>

an opinion article, published on Thursday, written by the former Daily Telegraph editor David Penberthy, that said the inquiry was \u201ca sham\u201d with a \u201cpolitical end\u201d to protect

have appeared, including that she boarded the ship on the 8th when NSW assessed it, and was in contact with the ship\u2019s doctor.</p> \n<p>He strongly denied that any member of the NSW government or cabinet had attempted to interfere in the inquiry, and said the senior solicitor for the inquiry has written to the editor of the Australian \u201cas to whether the comments in Penberthy\u2019s

Morrison, who criticised Walker\u2019s questioning.</p> \n<p>After Ressler\u2019s tearful testimony on Tuesday, Morrison told radio station 2GB that he thought Walker\u2019s \u201cline of questioning\u201d had been \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201ca bit out of line\u201d.</p> \n<p>On Friday, Walker said the media coverage of Morrison\u2019s comments \u201cmay have created a common misunderstanding that the prime minister made suggestions to me about the conduct of this independent inquiry\u201d.</p> \n<p>The commissioner said this was not the case, and that Morrison had spoken without \u201cknowledge of [the interview] or a view based on evidence\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe made clear that he had not seen the proceedings that led up to the unfortunate upset of the witness,\u201d Walker said. \u201cIt is clear from the prime minister\u2019s reported comments that to no extent at all was he suggesting that he had knowledge of or a view based on evidence.\u201d</p> \n<p>The inquiry also heard that Butchart spoke to NSW Ambulance officers and told them they should treat sick passengers as if they had Covid-19.</p> \n<p>Previous hearings heard that the port agent for Carnival Australia, which operates the Ruby Princess, arranged for two ambulances to immediately transfer two sick passengers to Royal Prince Alfred hospital when it docked on 19 March.</p> \n<p>One of those passengers later tested positive for Covid-19 and died.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\"

He is a really good father and he\u2019s not a monster,\u2019\u2019 Kirilly Dutton, 45, told the Sunday Mail.</p> <p>A regular on the Bolt Report, who has joined the ABC\u2019s Insiders panel with David Speers this year too, <a href=\"https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/activist-doctors-using-medevac-laws-as-a-back-door/video/57b48926364008a17dc99b1bce2bc995\">Viellaris told Sky News</a> earlier this year she agreed with Dutton that \u201cactivist doctors\u201d use the medevac legislation as a backdoor into Australia.</p> <p>It\u2019s perhaps no surprise then that Viellaris has resigned to join the Australian Federal Police\u2019s media unit, where Dutton is the responsible minister.</p> <h2><strong>Daily Telegraph apologises</strong></h2> <p>The Daily Telegraph has published a 250-word apology to former Silverchair frontman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/sep/19/daniel-johns-sues-news-corp-for-defamation-over-front-page-brothel-story\">Daniel Johns, who sued the Sunday Telegraph</a> in the supreme court of Victoria for publishing a front-page story which alleged that the notorious Sydney brothel The Kastle had become his second home.</p> <p>Under the headline \u201cKing of the Kastle\u201d in August last year, reporter Amy Harris, who was named along with editor Mick Carroll in the suit, said Johns had spent up to 18 hours a day at the brothel the previous two weeks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/dailytelegraph/status/1256702852057219078\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">On August 11, 2019, the Sunday Telegraph ran a photo of Daniel Johns and alleged he was swaggering out of Sydney brothel, The Kastle.

The minister is not wrong about the total budget \u2013 operational funding plus transmission costs \u2013 being higher than it was in 2013-14 but that is due to inflation.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/report-on-abc-funding-cuts-surprising-and-deeply-regrettable-says-communications-minister-paul-fletcher/news-story/cce9a7bc39ffc892ff3ed52929db475b\">The Daily Telegraph claimed the report was inaccurate</a> because it said the ABC lost $148.8m over eight years for an Australia Network contract \u201cthat was never awarded in the first place\u201d.</p> <p>But the contract was awarded by the previous Labor government and was subsequently cancelled by the Abbott government. Another Tele claim \u2013 that the report understates the ABC\u2019s budget by $183.7m \u2013 is also incorrect. The $187m is for transmission funding, which is always assessed separately from operational funding for the national broadcasters, a practice accepted by both sides of politics. Transmission is a fixed cost that goes to Broadcast Australia.</p> <p>The figures in the Per Capita report align with academic research by Michael Ward <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-abc-didnt-receive-a-reprieve-in-the-budget-its-still-facing-staggering-cuts-114922\">published by The Conversation last year </a>.</p> <p>The ABC\u2019s managing director and the defence minister, Linda Reynolds,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/03/bushfires-add-3m-to-abc-emergency-broadcasting-costs-as-coalition-cuts-funding\"> argued over semantics at Senate estimates </a>earlier this year when the minister said the government had maintained funding but David Anderson said the \u201cindexation pause\u201d amounted to a cut.</p> <h2><strong>Leaked photos \u2018appalling\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Media outlets took a different approach to leaked photos of former <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/afl\">AFL</a> player and coach Dean Laidley, taken while he was in police custody.</p> <p>Deputy commissioner Shane Patton described the leak as \u201cappalling\u201d and \u201cunacceptable\u201d after two photos, one from Laidley\u2019s official police file and another of him wearing a long blonde wig and a dress inside the custody area of a Melbourne police station, were published by the Herald Sun and the West Australian. </p> <p>The Age in Melbourne, and Guardian Australia, chose not to run the pictures.</p> <p>Despite the outcry over the invasion of privacy, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/04/dean-laidley-arrest-victoria-police-to-investigate-leaked-photos-of-ex-afl-coach\">condemnation from the Victorian police commissioner</a>, the pictures appeared in the Australian, Fox Sports and other News Corp papers throughout the week.
