  "<p>The day before British-Indian poet <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/bhanu-kapil\">Bhanu Kapil</a> learned she had won a <a href=\"https://windhamcampbell.org/\">Windham Campbell prize</a>, she had been wondering about how to balance writing, teaching and caring for her elderly mother. The next day, she received an email from the prize\u2019s director, Michael Kelleher, informing her that she had been awarded $165,000 (\u00a3141,000).</p> <p>\u201cSitting in bed, wondering about the future, I\u2019d said, aloud, \u2018Help\u2019,\u201d said the 51-year-old, who had never won a poetry prize before. \u201cThe moment Michael told me I\u2019d won, I felt as if what I\u2019d called out had been received. And I am not a religious person.\u201d</p> <p>One of the richest literary awards, the Windham Campbell prizes split $1.32m between eight writers around the world. They were set up by lifelong partners Donald Windham and Sandy M Campbell, to highlight literary achievement and provide writers with the opportunity to focus on their work independent of financial concerns.</p> <p>This year, the eight winners, chosen by an anonymous panel of judges, include Kapil, the author of six poetry collections, who was praised for her exploration of \u201ccrucial questions of trauma, healing and immigration\u201d. Meanwhile, Chinese-born author <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/24/yiyun-li-interview-dear-friend-from-my-life-i-write-to-you-in-your-life\">Yiyun Li</a>\u2019s writing was praised by judges for its \u201cformal beauty, imaginative daring, and intense interest in both the small flames of ordinary lives and the sweeping fires of political and social change\u201d. The other winners include debut Zambian novelist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/30/namwali-serpell-the-old-drift-interview\">Namwali Serpell</a>, whose novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/14/the-old-drift-namwali-serpell-review\">The Old Drift</a> was published last year, poet <a href=\"https://pen.org/user/jonah-mixon-webster/\">Jonah Mixon-Webster</a>, whose writing has tackled the public health crisis in his hometown of Flint, Michigan, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/anne-boyer\">Anne Boyer</a>, the author of a \u201csearingly honest\u201d memoir about her cancer diagnosis, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/18/the-undying-anne-boyer-notes-made-while-falling-jenn-ashworth-review\">The Undying</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"effc673b8722423ca0a1c61e50c91578b3233d9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/effc673b8722423ca0a1c61e50c91578b3233d9c/0_14_5773_3465/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yiyun Li\u2019s writing was praised for its \u2018formal beauty and imaginative daring\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yiyun Li\u2019s writing was praised for its \u2018formal beauty and imaginative daring\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denise Applewhite/Princeton University</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis is such an exciting group of prize recipients \u2013 so many utterly original voices from so many different places,\u201d said Kelleher. \u201cTo read the work of these eight writers \u2013 seven of them women \u2013 is simply overwhelming.\u201d</p> <p>Serpell discovered she\u2019d won while on campus at Berkeley, University of California, in the middle of a meeting. \u201cI opened my laptop to search for something and found an email with the subject line, \u2018URGENT: Windham Campbell prize\u2019.

  "<p>An investigation into the extent of institutional racism within the Home Office must be launched in response to a damning report on the Windrush scandal, an alliance of anti-racism groups has urged.</p> \n<p>The call came after the long-awaited publication of the independent inquiry into the government\u2019s handling of the scandal, which saw British citizens wrongly deported, dismissed from their jobs and deprived of services such as NHS care.</p> \n<p>The inquiry \u2013 which prompted an official apology from the home secretary, Priti Patel \u2013 concluded that the Home Office demonstrated \u201cinstitutional ignorance and thoughtlessness towards the issue of race\u201d. It was commissioned after the Guardian\u2019s reporting on the government\u2019s \u201chostile environment\u201d immigration policy led to the exposure of the scandal and eventually the resignation of the then home secretary, Amber Rudd.</p> \n<p>In response to the findings, a consortium of 16 pressure groups called on Thursday for the Home Office\u2019s immigration policies to be scrutinised to assess whether they are discriminatory.</p> \n<p>While the report stopped short of describing the Home Office as institutionally racist, the government now needed to analyse why \u201cHome Office culture, attitudes, immigrations and citizenship policies have repeatedly discriminated against black and ethnic minority British citizens,\u201d deputy director of the race equality thinktank the Runnymede Trust, Zubaida Haque, said.</p> \n<p>She added that the report made it \u201cvery clear that the injustice was not an accident, but a result of institutional failures to understand race and racism\u201d.</p> \n<p>In the report, the Home Office is blamed for operating a \u201cculture of disbelief and carelessness\u201d. It concludes that the failings are \u201cconsistent with some elements of the definition of institutional racism\u201d.</p> \n<p>Patel gave an official apology in the House of Commons on Thursday, saying: \u201cThere is nothing I can say today that will undo the suffering \u2026 On behalf of this and successive governments I am truly sorry.\u201d</p> \n<p>But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/09/special-needs-teacher-uk-50-years-loses-job-immigration-status\">Michael Braithwaite</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/09/special-needs-teacher-uk-50-years-loses-job-immigration-status\">, 68, who was sacked in 2017 from his job as a special-needs teaching assistant</a> at the London primary school where he had worked for more than 15 years (despite the fact that he had lived in the country for half a century) said he was frustrated to hear Patel make a new apology almost two years after the government first did so.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same expression of empathy, and more promises like last time.

It says warning signs of problems caused by the immigration policy \u2013 such as \u201cracially insensitive\u201d billboards telling people to \u201cgo home or face arrest\u201d \u2013 were ignored.</p> \n<p>There was a tendency to blame individuals caught up in the immigration regulations, the report says. They found themselves criticised for failing to obtain evidence of their status, even though when they tried to do so they were not provided with the right documentation.</p> \n<p>The report\u2019s author, Wendy Williams, an inspector of constabulary, said at its launch: \u201cThe Windrush generation has been poorly served by this country, a country to which they contributed so much and in which they had every right to make their lives. The many stories of injustice and hardships are heartbreaking, with jobs lost, lives uprooted and untold damage done to so many individuals and families.\u201d</p> \n<p>Williams said she met about 800 people, and many of the interviews had been extremely upsetting. She said one man had been in tears when he told her how he had lost his job and his home \u201cin tragic circumstances\u201d. He told her: \u201cI can\u2019t believe I have been treated like this by my beloved England.\u201d</p> \n<p>Williams said: \u201cThere were a number of examples that were equally as upsetting. There was an overwhelming sense of bewilderment. They couldn\u2019t understand how this had been allowed to happen.\u201d</p> \n<p>The 275-page report said the roots of the problem could be traced back to racially motivated legislation during the 1960s, 70s and 80s.</p> \n<p> Williams wrote: \u201cWhile I am unable to make a definitive finding of institutional racism with the department, I have serious concerns that these failings demonstrate an institutional ignorance and thoughtlessness towards the issue of race and the history of the Windrush generation within the department, which are consistent with some elements of the definition of institutional racism.\u201d</p> \n<p>She said many people \u201cfelt a strong sense of Britishness and had no reason to doubt their status or that they belonged in the UK. They could not have been expected to know the complexity of the law as it changed around them.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1d775b4e-d9e8-4530-a26a-ea91c6ba109b\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Who are the Windrush generation?</b></p>\n    <p>They are people who arrived in the UK after the second world war from Caribbean countries at the invitation of the British government.

  "<p>Emergency times require emergency measures. That can hardly be in dispute. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19 outbreak</a> is unquestionably an emergency. Entire populations are at risk from the disease, some groups acutely so. This is a totalising event. Exceptional measures are needed, in principle and in practice, here and <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/coronavirus-d%C3%A1il-meets-on-emergency-legislation-as-ni-reports-first-death-1.4206792?localLinksEnabled=false+D%C3%A1il+to+rush+through+emergency+legislation+as+NI+reports+first+death\">in other nations</a>, to ensure the safety of all the people and to maintain as comprehensive, orderly and effective a response to the crisis as can be achieved.</p> <p>The British government\u2019s principal emergency measure was published on Thursday. <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0122/20122.pdf\">The coronavirus bill</a> is a vast piece of legislation. It runs to 328 pages. The <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0122/en/20122en.pdf\">explanatory notes</a> run to a further 73. Both show signs of hurried drafting. It confers powers on the state to reorganise and control people\u2019s lives, and to set traditional freedoms aside, in ways that are unprecedented since the wartime emergency powers of 1939-45. The government proposes to get all the stages of the bill through the House of Commons on Monday and to put it on the statute book by the middle of next week. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/labour-mps-alarmed-covid-19-laws-being-passed-without-vote\">Labour opposition</a> is supporting it.</p> <p>The bill is necessary. We accept that. But it is all the more essential that it is properly scrutinised by MPs. This did not happen when wartime emergency powers were rushed through parliament in 1914 and 1939, with long-lasting and controversial effects. But it needs to happen now. This is an emergency on a par with war, but it is one of a very different kind. It directly affects everyone\u2019s entire way of life.</p> <p>The powers set out in the bill are vast. Ministers are given wide authority to govern by regulations that will not be properly scrutinised. The issues range from the NHS and the cremation of the dead through food supplies and transport to legal proceedings, elections and public order, as well as powers over the infectious. The overarching approach of the bill is to mobilise against the outbreak by removing checks, diluting procedures and strengthening powers. But the powers outlined in the bill are stuffed with potential civil liberty, privacy, surveillance and data protection issues.</p> <p>The bill\u2019s starting point is the very real need to mobilise people and resources to strengthen the NHS in the face of the emergency. But the issues and implications in the bill go beyond public health. In section 49, the government confers a power on police and immigration officers \u201cto direct individuals to attend, remove [a potentially infected person] to, or keep them at suitable locations for screening and assessment\u201d. Though the origins of this section lie in legitimate public health concerns, it raises extended issues of powers of arrest, search and detention. In the past, such powers have repeatedly been civil liberty minefields regarding issues such as vagrancy and suspicious behaviour. These will need to be transparently applied and tenaciously monitored in ways that earlier powers were not.</p> <p>It is therefore vital that parliament should have enough time to debate the coronavirus bill. That is not the case under the government\u2019s proposed timetable, agreed with Labour. There is huge pressure to get the bill into law so that its powers can be used. So the first and most important overarching change that should be made to the bill is to introduce a sunset clause. The bill is set to be enacted for two years. This is too long. The various powers should cease unless parliament votes to renew them \u2013 and has the opportunity to amend them \u2013 at intervals of six months. In a related reform, parliament should also seize this opportunity to change its antique, unhealthy voting system of queueing in lobbies, and introduce electronic voting.</p> <p>Legislate in haste but repent at leisure is <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/03/19/respect-rights-covid-19-response\">no idle warning</a>. Many powers from the 1939-45 war remained in force far longer in postwar peacetime than in the war years themselves. The last of them only disappeared for good in 1964. Anti-terrorism legislation and emergency powers in Northern Ireland have required renewals of this kind, and properly so. These are extraordinary times and they require strong collective action by the state and the people. But they do not require powers that end up creating as many problems as they solve, and which could have been resolved by proper legislative scrutiny.</p>",
  "<p>Wendy Williams, an inspector of constabulary, has produced a thoughtful and intelligent <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/873667/6.5577_HO_Windrush_Lessons_Learned_Review.pdf\" title=\"\">review</a> of the Windrush scandal. This shameful episode saw British citizens <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/19/windrush-report-condemns-home-office-ignorance-and-thoughtlessness\" title=\"\">wrongly</a> deported, dismissed from their jobs and deprived of services such as NHS care. More than 160 people, almost all of African-Caribbean descent, were detained or expelled. It is thought that up to 8,000 were likely to be caught in the web of misery.</p> <p>The reasons why this deplorable event occurred are complex. The trap had been set by decades of restrictive immigration laws and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/16/immigration-law-key-clause-protecting-windrush-immigrants-removed-in-2014\" title=\"\">questionable decisions</a>. But it was sprung by the Conservatives\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/27/hostile-environment-anatomy-of-a-policy-disaster\" title=\"\">hostile environment</a> policy. Two immigration acts in 2014 and 2016 had the <a href=\"https://www.freemovement.org.uk/briefing-what-is-the-hostile-environment-where-does-it-come-from-who-does-it-affect/\" title=\"\">effect</a> of requiring long-term residents to prove their right to be in the UK, limiting access to services if they could not do so, in a system of citizen-on-citizen immigration checks.</p> <p>Ms Williams, who had been <a href=\"https://www.civilserviceworld.com/articles/news/javid-appoints-police-watchdog-lead-windrush-review\" title=\"\">appointed</a> by Sajid Javid as part of the clean-up operation, took the Home Office to task for failing to look out for people it had responsibility for. A senior official in the report describes as \u201cunfortunate\u201d the fact that \u201cmost of the policymakers were white and most of the people involved were black\u201d. That is one way of putting it. Ms Williams suggests a culture stained with \u201cdisbelief and carelessness\u201d, and ingrained \u201cignorance and thoughtlessness\u201d, much of which chimed with the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51961933\" title=\"\">charge of institutional racism</a>.</p> <p>Priti Patel, the current home secretary, was right to apologise. But she was wrong to point the finger of blame at <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/priti-patel-windrush-scandal-apology-a4391911.html\" title=\"\">New Labour</a>. True, Labour ministers shamefully employed the language of the hostile environment. But this was <a href=\"https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20081023091612/http:/www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/aboutus/reports/indreview/indreview.pdf?view=Binary\" title=\"\">not backed</a> by statute. That was left to the Conservative governments that took over. In the last decade, officials and ministers ignored warning signs about the implications of their actions. When stories emerged, in this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/28/i-cant-eat-or-sleep-the-grandmother-threatened-with-deportation-after-50-years-in-britain\" title=\"\">paper</a>, of the Windrush generation, those who came to Britain between 1948 and 1973, falling victim to the harsher immigration controls in 2017, the Home Office sat on its hands.</p> <p>In 2018 Theresa May, who had been the architect of the Tories\u2019 hostile environment, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/15/no-10-refuses-caribbean-request-to-discuss-children-of-windrush\" title=\"\">proved so tin-eared</a> that she initially refused a formal diplomatic request from Caribbean leaders at a Commonwealth heads of government meeting to discuss the matter. Mrs May only relented when the visiting prime ministers went public with their concerns. The Home Office now runs a \u201c<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/compliant-environment-turning-ordinary-people-into-border-guards-should-concern-everyone-in-the-uk-107066\" title=\"\">compliant environment</a>\u201d. This is a change of label rather than a change of product. Ms Williams\u2019 recommendations should be implemented. The Home Office must acknowledge wrong, be open, more human, and have a race advisory board. Crucially, there needs to be a full review of the hostile environment.</p> <p>It was David Cameron who stripped away <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/nov/19/cameron-axe-equality-assessments\" title=\"\">the checks and balances</a> vital to cut the risk of policies\u2019 unintended consequences. This mentality contributed to the Windrush scandal. There is a significant lesson to learn here: political considerations must not drive internal targets, priorities and behaviour despite contrary evidence and with an indifference to humanity.</p>",
  "<p>In the six months between the first Windrush interview I did for the Guardian in November 2017 and the resignation of the Home Secretary in April 2018, I was on the phone so regularly to the Home Office press office that the department\u2019s on-hold music became permanently seared into my brain.</p> <p>Wendy Williams\u2019s report into the Windrush scandal offers a rare and fleeting insight into what was happening at the other end of the phone.</p> <p>I was frequently frustrated by the offhand nature of the official responses. Home Office staff seemed very slow to grasp what was happening, moving gradually over the months from dismissing the problem to blaming the individuals affected for their own difficulties, before attempting to downplay the scale of the issue.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/10/its-destroyed-my-life-windrush-victim-recognised-as-legal-citizen-after-13-years\">'It's destroyed my life': Windrush victim recognised as legal citizen after 13 years</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Williams report has detailed interviews with unnamed Home Office staff members revealing how calls from the Guardian began to trigger a sluggish internal inquiry.

The following day an immigration official emailed back to say they \u201cwould need to think carefully about how to respond\u201d.</p> <p>By the end of 2017, the Home Office acknowledged internally that the Guardian was \u201cuncovering a series of cases with a pattern that could no longer be interpreted as unique or a \u2018one-off\u2019\u201d. But no action was taken.</p> <p>When the Home Office realised it might have an issue with \u201ca few people\u201d, press officers were briefed to respond: \u201cWe\u2019re taking a closer look.\u201d But by February, senior officials told the press office staff to take a new line, in effect blaming individuals for their own difficulties, and claiming it was their own responsibility to sort out their status. \u201cThose who have resided in the UK for an extended period but feel they may not have the correct documentation confirming their leave to remain should take legal advice and submit the appropriate application with correct documentation so we can progress the case.\u201d</p> <p>That day, I spent a long time on the phone explaining to a press officer that people were not taking legal advice because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/25/windrush-scandal-immigration-legal-aid\">legal aid for immigration cases had been abolished</a> in 2012 by the government, and paying for a lawyer was unaffordable if you had been sacked from your job and denied benefits as a result of a Home Office decision to classify you as an illegal immigrant. People affected were also unable to make the application because the fees were unaffordable.</p> <p>By March, the press office had again changed its response. Now it asserted that: \u201cWe value the contribution made by Commonwealth citizens who have made a life in the UK.\u201d It was a peculiar formulation (which still remains in use by the press office), since Commonwealth citizens were coming forward in large numbers to describe how little they felt valued by a government that was treating them as if they had broken immigration laws.</p> <p>Downing Street remained oblivious to the growing unease. On 15 April 2018 the Guardian reported that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/15/no-10-refuses-caribbean-request-to-discuss-children-of-windrush\">No 10 had refused a formal diplomatic request from representatives of 12 Caribbean countries to meet the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/15/no-10-refuses-caribbean-request-to-discuss-children-of-windrush\">prime </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/15/no-10-refuses-caribbean-request-to-discuss-children-of-windrush\">minister</a> to discuss the situation of the Windrush generation. Downing Street officials told Williams that they were \u201cnot aware\u201d of the concerns the Caribbean leaders wanted to raise with the prime minister, and later found time for a meeting. But by that point the diplomatic snub had become international news, and within hours <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/17/uk-still-uncertain-about-windrush-era-deportations\">Theresa May was forced finally to apologise</a> for her government\u2019s treatment of the Windrush generation.</p>",

London being in \u201clockdown\u201d could mean quarantine and martial law (never a prospect, as No 10 made clear today) or just all the pubs being closed (still an option). And now we have got \u201cturn the tide\u201d, which Boris Johnson says the UK will be able to do within 12 weeks. Many people will hear that as a prediction that after three months life will start getting back to normal. But it may very well not mean that, as Johnson came close to acknowledging when he faced questions.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points from his press conference.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson said that the UK would be able to \u201cturn the tide\u201d in the fight against coronavirus in the next 12 weeks.</strong> In his opening remarks in the press conference, responding to growing public concern about how long the social distancing measures now in force might last, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m conscious as the days have gone by that people will want to know how long we\u2019re expecting them to keep it up.</p> \n   <p>I think, looking at it all, that we can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks and I\u2019m absolutely confident that we can send coronavirus packing in this country. </p> \n   <p>But only if we all take the steps that we\u2019ve outlined, that is vital, that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to reduce the peak and once we\u2019ve achieved that and I think that we will, if we take the steps I\u2019ve said, then the scientific progress that we\u2019ve been making will really start coming into play.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Johnson argued that by the middle of June scientific advances would be helping considerably in the fight against coronavirus (see below). But, when asked if he thought that people would be able to go on their summer holidays, he refused to give a direct answer to the question. And, when asked to explain what he meant by turning the tide within 12 weeks, he said he could not be sure the UK would be on the \u201cdownward slope\u201d at that point. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I believe that a combination of the measures that we\u2019re asking the public to take and better testing, scientific progress, will enable us to get on top of it within the next twelve weeks and turn the tide. </p> \n   <p>Now I cannot stand here and tell you that by the end of June that we will be on the downward slope. It\u2019s possible but I simply can\u2019t say that that\u2019s for certain, of course not, we don\u2019t know where we are, and we don\u2019t know how long this thing will go on for. </p> \n   <p>But what I can say is that this is going to be finite, we will turn the tide, and I can see how to do it within the next 12 weeks.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is a sensitive topic because, if coronavirus cannot be beaten within 12 weeks, then the social distancing measures in place now could stay in force for potentially a year or more. In <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf\">the Imperial College paper (pdf)</a> published on Monday, which explained the modelling that persuaded the government drastic \u201csuppression\u201d measures were vital, the authors said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The major challenge of suppression is that this type of intensive intervention package \u2013 or something equivalently effective at reducing transmission \u2013 will need to be maintained until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or more) \u2013 given that we predict that transmission will quickly rebound if interventions are relaxed.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/19/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-london-lockdown-williamson-refuses-to-rule-out-government-putting-london-in-lockdown-by-weekend?page=with:block-5e7366928f085e564ad87186#block-5e7366928f085e564ad87186\">At a briefing this morning </a><strong>Prof Chris Whitty</strong>, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser suggested that a long-term \u201cexit strategy\u201d from the current coronavirus policy could involve waiting for a vaccine.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson says the first British patient had been put in a randomised trial for a treatment for coronavirus. </strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said he expected that relatively soon the government would be able to do mass testing to see if people had had coronavirus. </strong>This could be a \u201cgame changer\u201d, he claimed, because it would allow the government to track the disease and determine when people could safely go back to work. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>To give you an idea of what is coming down the track, we\u2019re in negotiations today to buy a so-called antibody test, as simple as a pregnancy test which can tell whether you have had the disease and it\u2019s early days, but if it works as its proponents claim, then we will buy literally hundreds of thousands of these kits as soon as practicable. Because obviously it has the potential to be a total game changer.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, would tomorrow announce more details of measures to help businesses and workers.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He appealed to retailers not to engage in profiteering.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>On mass buying and the price issue, I really hope that retailers will continue to be reasonable.

The Guardian found one small pharmacy in south London offering paper bags of 13 paracetamol at 15p per tablet and without labelling, compared to 4p per tablet in supermarket packs last week. The same store was also selling a sample-sized bottle of hand sanitiser for \u00a34, when standard supermarket bottles of hand sanitiser are 300ml, roughly six times the volume, and were priced at \u00a33.49.</p> \n  <p>The regulator, the <strong>General Pharmaceutical Council</strong>, told us that pharmacists may need to \u201cdepart from established procedures\u201d given current exceptional circumstances and prepare smaller packs to keep families supplied, but should only sell them with the appropriate labelling and safety information. \u201cThe care of patients and the public should be the primary concern of pharmacy owners and professionals and they should not be exploiting the Covid-19 pandemic for financial gain,\u201d a spokesperson said. </p> \n  <p>The <strong>Royal Pharmaceutical Society</strong>, which represents pharmacists, said that splitting packs of paracetamol in this way was not normally within the rules, but that it was accepted that flexibility was needed. Its director of pharmacy Robbie Turner said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Because of coronavirus, demand for paracetamol is high and frontline pharmacists are faced with making difficult decisions about the supply of medicines every day.

It finished a few minutes ago. Glen is a junior minister and he did not have anything to announce to MPs. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor and his boss, has already said that the government is working urgently on a package of measures to help who are losing work and mostly Glen just kept telling MPs that the Treasury was still working on these measures urgently.</p> \n  <p>But, nevertheless, the session was highly revealing because it showed that backbench Conservative MPs are alarmed by the government\u2019s lack of action on this issue so far. Opposition MPs were also very critical, but that is what you would expect. Here are some of the comments from Conservatives.</p> \n  <p>From <strong>Greg Clark</strong>, the former business secretary who tabled the urgent question</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>All employers have an account with HRMC to pay tax for employees through Pay As You Earn (PAYE). The monthly wage bill is known to HMRC. </p> \n   <p>Instead of firms paying PAYE to the government, that flow should now be reversed with the nation paying the wages of people for the next weeks if, and only if, they continue to employ their staff. </p> \n   <p>Separate arrangements would need to be made for the self-employed, but at a stroke this would save people\u2019s jobs, save businesses and put an immediate end to the risk of contagion and help save the economy.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is similar to the ideas being proposed by the CBI and by the Resolution Foundation.</p> \n  <p>From <strong>Sir Iain Duncan Smith</strong>, the former work and pensions secretary</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There is something else the government can do, literally today. Universal credit has three basic levers which could all be pulled now enormously to help people who are in work. One, the taper could be lowered dramatically at this stage, which would push the floor right up underneath people in work at the moment, allowing them to fall back on that if government\u2019s cannot deal with them.</p> \n   <p>Second, you could change the benefit rates allowing the greater expanse of money to flow to them. This could be done today.</p> \n   <p>The third areas is to look at the waiting time [for benefits] and reduce that almost immediately. </p> \n   <p>Those three things were always built into the flexibility. They can be done today, they can be delivered within days by the department that already has the ability to do that whilst he gets on with this other facility.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1240594616082145281\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\u201cUniversal Credit has three basic levers that could all be pulled now\u2026 to help people who are in work,\u201d says Conservative MP Iain Duncan Smith <br><br>\u201cThis could be done today\u201d<br><br>Treasury economic secretary John Glen says he is looking at \u201call options\u201d<a href=\"https://t.co/5vned14aOf\">https://t.co/5vned14aOf</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/kf3ttTZnnH\">pic.twitter.com/kf3ttTZnnH</a></p>\u2014 BBC Politics (@BBCPolitics) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1240594616082145281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 19, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>From <strong>Sir Bernard Jenkin</strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Those of us who are not in the engine room of government are being told by our constituents that, welcome as Tuesday\u2019s package was, it\u2019s simply not going to be enough.

Firms would continue to pay workers at least two-thirds of their previous wages via their payroll, with the state providing a rebate for those payments at a cost of \u00a34bn for an initial six months if 500,000 employees were involved, and \u00a38bn if a million were.

It wants <strong>statutory sick pay to be extended and made more generous</strong>. It explains:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>On statutory sick pay (SSP), the government should extend it to the 2m employees who earn less than \u00a3118 per week (\u00a3120 from April) and are ineligible. This would cost around \u00a3200m. The government could go further and make SSP more generous, but only if it met the costs of that increase, for small and medium-sized firms at least. Increasing SSP from \u00a395.85 to \u00a3160 per week would ensure it covered half the earnings of employees that rely on it, up from the current third, and cost a further \u00a3800m for small and medium-sized firms.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And it is also calling for <strong>universal credit payments to be made more generous.</strong> It says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>To protect families affected from hardship, and strengthen the automatic stabilisers that support demand in the economy, the government also needs to strengthen the social safety net. The main adult rate of out-of-work support in universal credit (UC) and other benefits should rise by one-third, to \u00a3100 per week, with equivalent increases in young-adult and couple rates. This would cost \u00a310bn over a year.

This week the government has already a series of measures unprecedented in peacetime to fight coronavirus by limiting social contact. But there are indications that it is going to go even further. For the last 24 hours there have been widespread reports that Boris Johnson is planning to enforce measures that would put London, where the coronavirus outbreak is most advanced, under some form of effective lockdown. And in interviews this morning <strong>Gavin Williamson</strong>, the education secretary, did not rule it out.</p> \n  <p>On the Today programme, asked if the government would shut down bars, restaurants and tube stations in the capital, he said Johnson said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/18/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-pmqs-cbi-urges-government-pay-businesses-directly-saying-350bn-loangrant-package-not-enough?page=with:block-5e7261068f085e564ad86a2f#block-5e7261068f085e564ad86a2f\">at his press conference yesterday</a> that there were no plans to do that. But Williamson went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>But the prime minister will constantly be informed by the scientific and medical evidence. And, as has been demonstrated by the unprecedented move that we made yesterday in terms of closing schools, scrapping exams and all forms of other assessment, we will take the incredibly tough decisions that are sometimes needed in order to ensure the safety of the population.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked if that meant the government would be willing to implement these measures, Williamson went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The prime minister has at every stage in terms of dealing with this demonstrated that he will provide the leadership that is required in order to deal with some of the most difficult decisions that any prime minister has ever had to deal with in peacetime. But, as the prime minister said, there are certainly no plans to do so at the moment.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Quite what a lockdown in the capital would involve is not clear, but<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4648d3d4-693c-11ea-a3c9-1fe6fedcca75\"> in the Financial Times (paywall)</a> <strong>George Parker </strong>and<strong> Jim Pickard</strong> say one option might involve people being ordered to largely stay at home from Friday. They report:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>According to one person briefed on the proposal, there would be a full lockdown of the capital with only one person allowed to leave home at a time, with no entry to local shopping areas. </p> \n   <p> Supermarkets would be guarded by police, while pharmacies would be among the few other shops to remain open. </p> \n   <p> Two officials briefed on the proposals said residents and business would be given just 12 hours\u2019 notice of the new restrictions. They could initially be in place for about a fortnight.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>We will be covering the latest on this, and all other UK coronavirus developments, as the day goes on.</p> \n  <p>For the worldwide picture, do read our global coronavirus outbreak live blog.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/19/coronavirus-update-live-news-who-covid19-cases-outbreak-us-states-uk-school-closures-australia-europe-eu-africa-asia-latest-updates\">Coronavirus live news: some London tube stations shut down while Hubei reports no new cases</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> \n  <p><em>9.30am: </em>George Eustice, the environment secretary, takes questions in the Commons.</p> \n  <p><em>10.15am:</em> Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, gives evidence to the Commons foreign affairs committee.</p> \n  <p><em>After 10.30am: </em>Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, makes a statement to MPs about next week\u2019s business.</p> \n  <p><em>After 11.30am: </em>Priti Patel, the home secretary, is due to make a Commons statement about the Windrush Lessons Learned Review.

The youngest of the dead were two 15-year-old boys.</p> <p>Five people have been charged in the UK in connection with their deaths while an Irish lorry driver wanted for his alleged role is fighting his extradition from Dublin.</p> <p>The names of the deceased were read aloud during a short hearing at Essex coroner\u2019s court on Thursday. A Vietnamese interpreter who was due to assist at the hearing had to go into self-isolation over the coronavirus.</p> <p>Lincoln Brookes, the area coroner for Essex, said the 39 deaths were \u201cclearly on any view a tragedy on a large scale and a personal tragedy to each of the families\u201d.</p> <p>Eight women and 31 men and boys were found dead in the lorry parked on the Waterglade industrial park in Grays in the early hours of 23 October last year.</p> <p>Postmortem and toxicology reports had given the cause of death as asphyxia and hyperthermia \u2013 a lack of oxygen and overheating \u2013 in an enclosed space, said coroner\u2019s officer Nick Hale.</p> <p>The hearing was adjourned until any criminal proceedings linked with the case were concluded, the coroner said.</p> <p>Essex police said last month they had sent detectives to the south-east Asian country to meet relatives of the deceased as they investigated the alleged human trafficking plot.</p> <p>In Vietnam, police have also charged seven people \u2013 including a Vietnamese woman living in China \u2013 in connection with the cross-border investigation.</p> <p>Detectives from Essex police believe a number of Vietnamese people may have come into the UK illegally through Purfleet in October, and are asking them to come forward to help with the investigation.</p>",
  "<p>Police, public health and immigration officers will be able to detain people suspected of having Covid-19 and exact \u00a31,000 fines for refusing tests under emergency powers rolled out by the UK government.</p> \n<p>The guidance detailed in the coronavirus bill allows public health officers to order someone believed to be infected to undergo screening and testing within 14 days.

The policy aim of these provisions is to ensure that proportionate measures can be enforced if and when necessary.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe proposals will provide public health officers, constables and (in some circumstances) immigration officers with the means to enforce sensible public health restrictions, including returning people to places that they have been required to stay.\u201d</p> \n<p>The bill also gives the government stronger powers to intervene if it suspects anyone is disrupting the distribution of food.</p> \n<p>Industry insiders said new clauses will give ministers the power to demand information at short notice if they suspect food has been acquired on the black market.</p> \n<p>Funeral directors will be able to register deaths and cause of death certificates to registrars electronically and will also \u201cremove need for second confirmatory medical certificate in order for cremation to take place\u201d.</p> \n<p>While Labour has called for the powers to be reviewed every six months, the bill instead only requires the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to prepare a report on its operation every two months, with a motion put before parliament after every sixth report \u2013 ie once a year.</p> \n<p>This motion would be a so-called motion in neutral terms, put before the Commons and Lords, saying that MPs and peers had considered the report. Such motions are not usually amendable.</p> \n<p>Before the emergency powers were proposed by the government on Thursday, a cross-party group of MPs and peers warned that any measures it takes to curb the spread of coronavirus must not breach human rights provisions.</p> \n<p>The intervention by parliament\u2019s joint committee on human rights comes after Jeremy Corbyn wrote to Boris Johnson asking that the powers in the new coronavirus bill, which will last for two years, are reviewed every six months.</p> \n<p>Opposition parties are not expected to seek votes on the emergency legislation, which is expected to complete all stages of the Commons on Monday, and then pass through the Lords on Wednesday and Thursday.</p> \n<p>However, both party leaderships and MPs are lobbying hard to try to ensure safeguards, with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/retired-and-student-medics-may-be-called-in-to-tackle-covid-19-in-uk\">new powers set to include</a> the potential ability of police to ban all gatherings, and to detain people with the virus and move them to quarantine.</p> \n<p>In a letter to Johnson, Corbyn said people understood the need for temporary restrictions. He added: \u201cBut given how far-reaching these are proposed to be, people\u2019s elected representatives must be able to decide whether to renew the legislation at least every six months, up to its expiration after two years.\u201d</p> \n<p>The human rights committee has published a 12-page interim report into potential civil liberties issues that could arise because of the powers in the legislation.</p> \n<p>It stresses that all measures should comply with the UK\u2019s obligations under both the UN and European conventions on human rights. </p> \n<p>Harriet Harman, the Labour MP who chairs the human rights committee, said: \u201cTimes of national crisis call for strong and decisive leadership. However, at this time, it is also vitally important that checks and balances are in place to ensure that human rights are not disregarded, and that people remain fully protected under the law.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe committee will be thoroughly scrutinising the measures taken and any proposed legislation.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>German police have raided properties in 10 states and arrested members of a far-right group after it was banned by the government.</p> <p>The United German Peoples and Tribes organisation belongs to the broader <em>Reichsb\u00fcrger</em> or Citizens of the Reich movement, which rejects the authority of the modern German state and is driven by conspiracy theories. It is armed and considered extremely dangerous, the police said.</p> <p>An interior ministry spokesman said on Thursday that its fight against rightwing extremism would not be halted even during the current global health emergency. \u201cFor the first time, the interior ministry has banned a <em>Reichsb\u00fcrger</em> group,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cEven in these days of crisis, we will continue to fight far-right extremism, racism and antisemitism.</p> <p>Herbert Reul, the interior minister of the state of Nordrhein-Westfalen, where the group had its focus, said: \u201cThese people cannot consider themselves safe even in these times of the coronavirus.\u201d He said he was grateful to the federal interior minister, Horst Seehofer, \u201cfor allowing us to proceed against this brown sauce\u201d, in a reference to their Nazi-sympathies.</p> <p>He described the group as a danger to society. \u201cThese people deny the existence of the Federal Republic of Germany and agitate against Jews and foreigners,\u201d said Reul. \u201cThis is the right moment to go after people who spread such conspiracy theories. There is no tolerance towards them, only a hard line of action.\u201d</p> <p>Similar to the sovereign citizen movement in the US, the <em>Reichsb\u00fc</em><em>rger</em> movement rejects the modern state, arguing that Germany is not a country but a company. They refuse to recognise German laws, evade taxes and fines and have their own currency. They also mix Holocaust denial with conspiracy theories.</p> <p>Police seized, computers, weapons and ammunition, baseball bats, propaganda literature and drugs during the dawn raids, officers said.</p> <p>The group has a core membership of just 21 people nationwide, and a further 100 followers. The wider movement counts thousands more members, most of whom are males between 40 and 60 years old.</p> <p>Sensitivity toward the group\u2019s existence has grown since the terror attack last month in the city of Hanau when a suspected extremist shot dead nine people, all of whom were from migrant backgrounds. The gunman was not a member of the group, but shared certain tendencies with its members.</p> <p>After the shooting, Seehofer declared war on the far-right extremist scene. He said it was the biggest security threat Germany faced and that it had left a \u201ctrail of blood\u201d across Germany in recent months.</p> <p>An antisemitic attack on a synagogue in Halle in October and the murder of a pro-refugee politician at his home last June have also heightened awareness of the phenomenon.</p> <p>Seehofer announced an increase in police measures as a result, including more resources to fight extremism online, and has signalled a willingness to tighten gun ownership laws.</p>",
  "<p>It was the smell that was the worst. In this dusty camp on Pakistan\u2019s border with Iran, which at one stage held more than 6,000 people, the stench of sweat, rubbish and human excrement hung in the air. There was no real housing, just five people to a ragged tent, and no bathrooms, towels or blankets.</p> <p>The camp, in the town of Taftan in Balochistan province, was supposed to function as a sanitary quarantine location, preventing the spread of the coronavirus from Iran, which has had one of the worst outbreaks globally.</p> <p>Instead, according to Mohammed Bakir, who was held there for two weeks, it was no more than \u201ca prison \u2026 the dirtiest place I have ever stayed in my life\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThese were the hardest days and nights of my life,\u201d said Bakir. \u201cWe were treated like animals.

According to doctors at the camp, even those who presented with symptoms were not tested or even isolated, and there was a severe shortage of doctors and nurses. There was such a lack of medical facilities, the few doctors on site took to paying for necessary medicines themselves. Things got so bad that protests broke out among those quarantined.</p> <p>\u201cNeither the quarantining service nor the testing procedure was satisfactory at all,\u201d said one doctor, who asked not to be named. \u201cIn the first 20 days, many people had symptoms, but there was no testing at all. We had no testing facilities for three weeks. One child was sent to [a] hospital in Quetta, and he tested positive. But there was no isolation or testing for anyone else.</p> <p>\u201cThere were patients with diabetes, hepatitis and other diseases who were quarantined for 14 days without any proper medication. Their conditions were really bad there and they were treated like animals.\u201d</p> <p>The border between Pakistan and Iran is more than 600 miles and movement between the two countries is extremely common, especially among minority Shia Muslims in Pakistan who travel to Iran on religious pilgrimages. It is also a crucial trade route.</p> <p>But over the past two weeks, it has become a hotbed of coronavirus, with infections going up by the dozen every day. There are 302 reported cases of coronavirus in Pakistan, the highest number of cases in south Asia.</p> <p>Even though infections in Iran began to rise rapidly weeks ago, the Pakistan government only officially shut the border less than a week ago. And the border is still porous; on Tuesday night at least 100 pilgrims crossed from Iran into Balochistan, reportedly after bribing border guards.</p> <p>Among those held in Taftan was Abid Hussain, who is from Nagar in Gilgit-Baltistan, and was quarantined for two weeks after returning from Iran. \u201cIt\u2019s like I have been released from prison,\u201d said Hussain. \u201cThey call it a quarantine but we didn\u2019t get hand wash, face masks or any other sanitary facilities. The only check was that in the morning a doctor used to come round taking everyone\u2019s temperature. That was it for 13 days. Everyone was desperate to leave.\u201d</p> <p> Many of those in Taftan have been released or transferred to other facilities, but 1,200 remain.</p> <p>Hussain also described lax regulations on movement for those in the camp, with many going to shops in the town, walking around the vicinity and having regular social gatherings. No guidelines were issued for how those in quarantine could protect themselves from getting the disease, and there was no running water for people to wash their hands.</p> <p>Hundreds of people supposedly under lockdown left the camp to shop at local markets and stores, buying food and returning to the camp without any checks.</p> <p>\u201cAround these fruit stalls it was more like a scene from a busy Friday bazaar which was run by people who should have been quarantine camp in lockdown,\u201d said one eyewitness.</p> <p>The situation was equally bad in the hospitals in Balochistan, the least developed and most impoverished province of Pakistan, which were tasked with dealing with the outbreak. A doctor at one hospital in Quetta claimed that medical staff had refused to treat or even examine a young girl with all the symptoms of coronavirus, whose father had recently returned from China for work. The girl reportedly died days later without being tested.</p> <p>Pakistan\u2019s mishandling of the coronavirus outbreak, said the doctor, was \u201cdepressing and disturbing\u201d.</p> <p>Pakistan has a notoriously poor track record for containing disease outbreaks and is one of only two countries in the world that have failed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/nov/07/pakistan-accused-of-cover-up-over-fresh-polio-outbreak\">eliminate polio</a>.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A prison service source said the course of action taken suggested the inmate had an underlying health condition.</p> \n<p>Visits are going ahead at Strangeways, formally known as HMP Manchester, which has an operational capacity of 1,238 inmates. A prison service spokesperson said: \u201cOur priority is to maintain a normal regime for as long as possible, including visits.\u201d But some have questioned whether current practices can continue, with the charity Appeal calling for a proportion of low-risk offenders to be released.</p> \n<p>It is understood prison officers and other staff who had contact with the inmate are now self-isolating. There is also some isolation in place on the wing where the man was living, however it is not clear if fellow prisoners on that wing have been locked down or moved to other cells.</p> \n<p>A prison service source said it was no surprise there had been a confirmed case and that more were expected in the coming weeks and months.</p> \n<p>Current guidance advises that restrictions to inmate movements may apply in prisons where the disease is detected. As yet there are no overarching plans to stop the movement of inmates between prisons in the UK. </p> \n<p>In 2018 a report by MPs concluded 15% of the prison population had respiratory conditions, and last year inspectors found 10 out of 35 men\u2019s prisons failed to meet the minimum standards of infection control compliance and cleanliness.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/cumulative\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>One woman whose son is in prison told the Guardian he had told her some inmates were refusing to report symptoms \u201cbecause they don\u2019t want to be locked in all that time\u201d.</p> \n<p>She said: \u201cWhen I asked my son if he was managing to self-isolate, he said he couldn\u2019t because if they want to have a hot drink they have to go with a jug to communal hot water area, so he\u2019s having to mix with other people.

He has to have antibiotics on a daily basis and I\u2019m really scared he\u2019s going to get it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Coker\u2019s report was commissioned by Duncan Lewis Solicitors, who have embarked on what is thought to be the first legal action against the government relating to Covid-19. The law firm has called on the Home Office to release many detainees from immigration detention centres because of the high risk of contracting Covid-19 if they remain locked up. The suspension of flights means few are likely to be removed from the UK imminently.</p> \n<p>A legal challenge lodged on Monday argues that the Home Office has failed to protect immigration detainees from Covid-19 and failed to identify which detainees are at particular risk of serious harm or death if they do contract the virus due to their age or underlying health conditions.</p> \n<p>It calls for the release of all those who are particularly vulnerable and for all detainees to be tested for Covid-19, along with the suspension of all new detentions. The action warns even a short delay could have \u201ccatastrophic consequences\u201d.</p> \n<p>The legal action expresses concern about the large numbers involved. Last year 24,443 people were detained, and at any one time 1,500-2,000 are detained. Many of those locked up have arrived from high-risk countries such as Iran, China and Italy. Some are forced to share rooms, and a \u201clock-in\u201d regime prevents many from leaving their cells during the night.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The charity <a href=\"https://detentionaction.org.uk/\">Detention Action</a> and a vulnerable detainee are bringing the legal action.</p> \n<p>Coker believes there is a risk of a serious outbreak behind locked doors, with a figure of 60% of people getting infected \u201cplausible and credible\u201d. He likened the conditions for incubation to those on a cruise ship.</p> \n<p>He said action to express these issues was needed \u201cextremely urgently\u201d. His report states: \u201cIf detention is unnecessary, it should be relaxed.\u201d</p> \n<p>Bella Sankey, the director of Detention Action, said: \u201cThe situation across the UK\u2019s immigration detention estate is dire \u2013 a large at-risk population, no information on Covid and a lack of soap and basic cleaning materials. Without immediate action to release those detained, the government faces a human catastrophe of its own making.\u201d</p> \n<p>Toufique Hossain, of Duncan Lewis Solicitors, said: \u201cThe government is sitting on its hands, keeping detainees locked up during this pandemic, contrary to its earnest public health instruction and exposing detainees to a severe risk of infection. The time for swift action is overdue.\u201d</p> \n<p> A Home Office spokesman said: \u201cThese claims are completely false. The health of people in these centres is of the utmost importance. We have robust contingency plans and are following all Public Health England guidance.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere have been no recorded cases of coronavirus in immigration removal centres. Measures such as protective isolation will be considered to minimise the risk of Covid-19 spreading to vulnerable groups in the immigration detention estate.</p> \n<p>\u201cBasic hygiene is a key part of tackling coronavirus. Handwashing facilities are available in all immigration removal centres and we are working closely with suppliers to ensure adequate supply of soap and cleaning materials.</p> \n<p>\u201cAll immigration removal centres have dedicated health facilities run by doctors and nurses which are managed by the NHS or appropriate providers. All detainees receive a medical screening by a nurse within two hours.\u201d</p> \n<p>The spokesman added: \u201cWe do not comment on ongoing legal proceedings. We remain committed to removing foreign national offenders or those who violate our immigration rules.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>Almost every day, there is a new story about the Home Office needlessly ruining someone\u2019s life. In recent weeks, one of my constituents was made to sleep rough for weeks in a Brussels train station, after being <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/british-man-blocked-uk-home-office-passport-brussels-a9332311.html\">made stateless</a> on return from holiday without any warning; another man was <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/home-office-deportation-illegal-court-pakistan-charter-flight-a9370251.html\">deported</a> despite the high court ruling that it would be illegal; and the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/10/it-felt-like-intentional-torture-the-windrush-victims-who-are-still-homeless-two-years-on\">reported</a> that a man who had been forced on to the streets by the Windrush scandal is still homeless two years later.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/19/windrush-report-condemns-home-office-ignorance-and-thoughtlessness\">Windrush report condemns Home Office 'ignorance and thoughtlessness'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Windrush scandal, which resulted in the systematic and unlawful detention or deportation of at least 164 black British citizens, is just the most grievous example of Home Office failure. But as Wendy Williams\u2019 blistering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/19/windrush-report-condemns-home-office-ignorance-and-thoughtlessness\">Windrush Lessons Learned </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/19/windrush-report-condemns-home-office-ignorance-and-thoughtlessness\">review</a> shows, the department\u2019s problems are broader and deeper than one scandal.</p> <p>The review exposes the department as unfit for the society it is supposed to serve, after a series of colossal failures, rooted in a toxic internal culture and an ingrained misunderstanding of Britain\u2019s colonial history. It showed \u201cinstitutional ignorance and thoughtlessness\u201d on race issues that is \u201cconsistent with some elements of the definition of institutional racism\u201d. It calls for ministers and officials to make an \u201cunqualified apology\u201d to \u201cthose affected and the wider Afro-Caribbean community\u201d, but more importantly it says that the sincerity of this apology can only be judged the extent of the \u201csystemic and sustainable cultural change\u201d that follows it. Every Windrush citizen harmed by the government deserves to be compensated immediately, but the true test of whether the British government has learned its lesson will be the future policies it chooses to implement.</p> <p>There is not one easy fix to the culture of the Home Office, or the inhumane policies driving the unnecessary suffering it creates. However, the Lessons Learned review provides a unique opportunity as well as a blueprint to fix a broken department. Home Office reform should follow four steps.</p> <p>Of all the reports and newspaper briefings that have characterised Priti Patel\u2019s crisis-ridden tenure at the helm of the Home Office, perhaps the most concerning was that which suggested she is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/21/priti-patel-storm-warning-civil-servant-david-normington-immigration\">not committed to the rule of law</a>. When the UK government presides over a regime that fails to give migrants proper legal representation, splits children from their parents and deports people against legal advice, it is not only the immediate victims who are harmed. These failures fatally undermine the UK\u2019s standing as a champion of the rule of law and human rights in the world.</p> <p>Wendy Williams\u2019 review outlines that many of these failures stem from \u201ccultural issues\u201d in the department. The only way to fix them is with a new positive vision. That means replacing the \u201cdefensive culture\u201d, \u201cnegative terminology\u201d and \u201cbiased language\u201d with a new culture which is open to feedback, ideas, criticism and learning. The Home Office needs to develop a new mission statement and purpose rooted in the British values of the rule of law, democracy, individual liberty, diversity, openness and respect for those from different backgrounds, faiths and beliefs. Internally, the department\u2019s new purpose must be to replace the deeply divisive culture that has distorted immigration control from a responsibility into a sport. Whistleblowers should be actively protected, rather than dismissed. The department\u2019s diversity and inclusion strategy must be made concrete with tangible targets. All staff should be required to undergo education and training to understand Britain\u2019s colonial history, migration and the story of black Britons.</p> <p>Second, we need to rebuild the Home Office in a way that recognises the internal contradiction of being a department that controls immigration, but that also has a fundamental duty to protect vulnerable communities. We need to retrain Home Office officials to recognise that their primary duty is to resolve people\u2019s problems, not exacerbate them. The culture of awarding bonuses in reward for meeting quotas encourages officials to treat individuals as means to an end, rather than as human beings. This must stop. There is no reason that processes for people to be reunited with their families should be designed in a way so complex that even some lawyers struggle to understand them. The Home Office should make it easier and much less expensive for individuals to legalise the status that is rightfully theirs.</p> <p>As the review highlights, caseworkers in the Home Office need to develop a \u201ccraft\u201d, to replace its current \u201cfactory line approach\u201d. This means picking up the phone and arranging face-to-face meetings in complex cases. In terms of data collection and metrics, the Home Office must enter the 21st century. It can no longer be a paper department and it must create a central process for collecting, recording and monitoring data so that it can spot patterns of failure and respond to them.</p> <p>Third, the hostile environment must be replaced by a humane environment. By turning teachers, doctors and landlords into border guards, the government manufactured an \u201cus and them\u201d culture that led to gross discrimination across the public realm. The review calls for an immediate end to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/01/right-to-rent-scheme-ruled-incompatible-with-human-rights-law\">\u201cright to rent laws\u201d</a> and says the department must take \u201curgent action\u201d to review every hostile environment measure. The implications are clear. We should scrap the entire hostile environment, and immediately introduce a process for individuals who have been discriminated against because of it to get compensation.</p> <p>Finally, we can look at creative policy solutions to detoxify immigration issues that go beyond the scope of the Windrush Lessons Learned Review. A one-off immigration amnesty would lift 1.2 million undocumented migrants out of the black economy, allowing them to work legally, pay taxes and contribute to society. It would also massively reduce the Home Office\u2019s workload. Other countries, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/may/09/spain.gilestremlett\">including Spain</a>, have successfully implemented amnesties on a similar scale. This is a policy that can find cross-party support, having previously been supported by Boris Johnson. A one-off amnesty could be the perfect opportunity for the Home Office to hit reset. Another potential idea is devolving parts of migration policy to the regional level. This could only follow a radical decentralisation of the UK. However, doing so could resolve existing tensions that result from varying public opinion in different parts of the country.</p> <p>If the government is serious about righting the wrongs suffered by the Windrush generation, it will recognise that this moment cannot be ignored. The Home Office\u2019s systematic mistreatment of migrants, as well as British citizens, is a moral stain on the United Kingdom. Rebuilding the UK\u2019s immigration system separately from Wendy Williams\u2019 Lessons Learned review, rather than alongside it, would be the final insult to a generation that asked for so little, but gave so much.</p> <p>\u2022 David Lammy is the Labour MP for Tottenham<br><br></p>",
  "<p>In her report on the Windrush scandal, Wendy Williams does not quite brand the Home Office institutionally racist \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/19/windrush-report-condemns-home-office-ignorance-and-thoughtlessness\">but she comes close</a>.</p> \n<p>Williams\u2019 finding that failings within the department amounted to an \u201cinstitutional ignorance and thoughtlessness towards the issue of race\u201d that was consistent with \u201csome elements of the definition of institutional racism\u201d should prompt some significant soul-searching.</p> \n<p>The home secretary, Priti Patel, has pledged to review the recommendations and pay close detail to the way her department \u201cviews the communities it serves\u201d. Crucially, she has committed to looking at the government\u2019s \u201ccompliant environment policies\u201d, more often known as the \u201chostile environment\u201d.</p> \n<p>The Home Office is already facing mounting calls to scrap the policies, which, if not the cause of the Windrush scandal, undoubtedly compounded it.</p> \n<p>Introduced by Theresa May as home secretary in two immigration acts in 2014 and 2016, the policies essentially empowered a range of figures across society to become immigration enforcement officers. Landlords were required to conduct right-to-rent checks, doctors were asked to assess the immigration statuses of the sick before they were treated, and checks by banks and employers were also demanded.</p> \n<p>In her review, Williams makes clear that the hostile environment evolved under the Labour, coalition and Conservative governments successively and does not pin the blame on the 2014 and 2016 acts exclusively.</p> \n<p>However, those powers remain, and dismantling or reworking them would be a significant step forward in aiding the cultural change that Williams is calling for.</p> \n<p>Yvette Cooper, the chair of the home affairs select committee, said: \u201cWe need to see urgent action now on the hostile environment, on overhauling casework culture and the culture of targets in the Home Office, to ensure that the same cultural and organisational concerns we have previously raised do not lead to more scandals like this in the future.\u201d</p> \n<p>On the issue of race, Williams is clear that the Home Office needs to review its diversity, inclusion and unconscious-bias awareness training, and tackle its lack of senior figures from minority backgrounds.</p> \n<p>But she goes beyond classic HR solutions. She suggests new Home Office staff should be educated on the history of the UK and its relationship with the rest of the world, including Britain\u2019s colonial history, the history of inward and outward migration and the history of black Britons.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, Williams says this goes to the heart of what the Home Office stands for. What is its purpose? Her answer is to say that the home secretary should set a clear mission statement that has at its core \u201cfairness, humanity, openness, diversity and inclusion\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"61c6edce-7dd7-4965-b71f-f5eacd2078fe\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jUefQy1Wa1s?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Patel committed to clarifying the department\u2019s purpose in this spirit, adding: \u201cI want to make the Home Office a better place to work.\u201d</p> \n<p>But as far as the immigration directorates work, the proposals come at a complicated time. The home secretary has tasked her officials with overhauling the immigration system for post-Brexit Britain, with a point-based system focused on skilled workers to be introduced.</p> \n<p>Overhauling the department\u2019s culture while implementing one of the biggest policy shifts in recent times will be a significant ask.</p>",
  "<h2>Recommendation: ministers should admit that serious harm was inflicted on people who are British, and provide an unqualified apology to those affected</h2> <p>The review found that the government ignored repeated warnings, and that ministers were still failing to acknowledge the extent of suffering inflicted on thousands of people who were mistakenly classified as illegal immigrants by the Home Office. Throughout her interviews, Wendy Williams encountered a reflexively defensive position from senior civil servants and ministers. While officials agreed that the situation was \u201ctragic\u201d, there was a consistent desire to blame the individuals for failing to apply for documentation.</p> <p>Officials told her: \u201cIt was the fault of the people caught up in it that they didn\u2019t get evidence of their status and when they tried to, they didn\u2019t provide the right documentation.\u201d In the most strongly worded section of the report, Williams expresses frustration that ministers and senior officials did not appear to accept the full extent of the injustice done.</p> <p>\u201cMany gave the impression that the situation was unforeseen, unforeseeable and therefore unavoidable. Whereas, the evidence clearly shows that the sequence of events which culminated in the scandal, while unforeseen, was both foreseeable and avoidable.\u201d</p> <p>She concludes that unless there is a genuine acceptance of its failings, all attempts to right the wrongs of the Windrush generation will seem hollow, and warns that the department risks repeating the mistakes that led to the scandal.</p> <h2>Finding: race clearly played a part in what happened to the Windrush generation</h2> <p>Williams says she had \u201creally serious concerns\u201d about racism within the department. The report does not find that the Home Office was institutionally racist, but it offers a detailed analysis of how \u201cthoughtlessness\u201d and \u201cignorance\u201d on race contributed to the scandal.</p> <p>\u201cI think it is unfortunate that most of the policymakers were white and most of the people involved were black,\u201d a senior official told her. Williams finds a lack of understanding about the nature of racism: \u201cThere seems to be a misconception that racism is confined to decisions made with racist motivations \u2026 This is a misunderstanding of both the law and racism generally.\u201d She notes that the Home Office failed to track \u201cthe racial impact of its policies and decisions\u201d.</p> <h2>Recommendation: the department should establish a race advisory board, and teach staff about Britain\u2019s colonial history</h2> <p>This may go some way to addressing ongoing concerns about whether the department is institutionally racist. Williams highlights the lack of ethnic diversity at senior levels in the Home Office, reflecting a pronounced disparity with the public it serves. Black, Asian and minority ethnic staff are predominantly concentrated in the lower grades, and in 2018 made up 26.14% and 26.33% of the two lowest grades respectively, but only 7.18% of the senior civil service roles. She finds there has been low take-up of unconscious bias training in the department. \u201cThe Windrush scandal was in part able to happen because of the public\u2019s and officials\u2019 poor understanding of Britain\u2019s colonial history.\u201d</p> <p>A race advisory board might focus on improving these failings. But campaign groups want the government to go further. A group of 16 leading race equality organisations, led by the Runnymede Trust and the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, has called on the Equalities and Human Rights Commission to investigate whether there is institutional racism in the Home Office.</p> <h2>Recommendation: the home secretary should commission officials to undertake a full review of the hostile/compliant environment policy and measures</h2> <p>The Home Office, under Theresa May, was aware of significant concerns about the potential for the hostile environment measures to result in discrimination, the review finds, adding: \u201cDespite the warnings, the department failed to monitor, or properly evaluate, the effectiveness and impact of the compliant environment measures.\u201d</p> <p>The review makes clear that the roots of the scandal stretch back over decades, as immigration legislation was gradually tightened from 1948 onwards, and notes the responsibility of Labour governments in the 1990s onwards in tightening immigration controls. However, it pinpoints the development of hostile environment policies during May\u2019s time at the Home Office as the moment at which problems escalated. The creation of the \u201chostile environment\u201d was done with a \u201ccomplete disregard\u201d for the Windrush generation, the report finds. \u201cWarning signs and messages about the hostile environment policy were not heeded.\u201d</p> <p>A key failure was a misplaced assumption in the impact assessments for the 2013 and 2015 immigration bills that those who were unable to prove that they were here legally were therefore here unlawfully. This was not the case. Around 17% of the UK population do not have passports, and until the introduction of the hostile environment most people had not needed them. After the report\u2019s publication, Labour called for a repeal of hostile environment legislation, and the home secretary Priti Patel said she would review the report\u2019s recommendations.</p> <h2>Finding: Windrush victims are still vulnerable to compliant environment measures</h2> <p>Some Windrush victims remain in severe financial and personal difficulties, facing homelessness and unemployment because of Home Office policies. Many people affected have not approached the Home Office because they remain scared of the threat of immigration enforcement action, Williams notes. The true scale of the problem remains unknown.</p> <h2>Finding: the department displayed a lack of empathy for individuals and used dehumanising jargon and cliches</h2> <p>Using words like \u201cstock\u201d and \u201cflow\u201d when describing immigration numbers is dehumanising, Williams says, criticising the way the department refers to people as a group, rather than recognising that individual lives are at stake. This language has \u201can impact on the attitudes and behaviour of staff towards people with whom they come into contact\u201d \u2013 and contributes to officials \u201closing sight of individuals\u201d. Initiatives like use of the \u201cGo home\u201d vans were \u201cracially insensitive\u201d, and should never be repeated.</p> <h2>Finding: the Home Office displayed \u201cdefensiveness, lack of awareness and an unwillingness to listen and learn from mistakes\u201d.</h2> <p>This review follows numerous previous highly critical reports about the Home Office, published over the past 15 years. One senior official said: \u201cThe department has got used to being beaten up.\u201d</p> <p>This defensiveness meant that officials were unwilling to acknowledge the scale of what had gone wrong. \u201cThere is the sense that priorities and decisions have been driven by an overwhelming desire to defend positions of policy and strategy \u2013 often at the expense of defending individuals from the impact of policies.\u201d The report recommends that officials be reminded of their duty to speak up when worried about the risks of policies and offer \u201ccandid\u201d advice to ministers.</p> <h2>Recommendation: the department should be more proactive in identifying people affected</h2> <p>The government has admitted that over 160 people were wrongly detained or deported to Caribbean countries, but has never investigated who has been deported to other Commonwealth countries. Campaign groups will welcome the request that Home Office extend its own investigations into who it might have wrongly deported.</p> <h2>Finding: a \u2018target-dominated\u2019 work environment within the immigration system contributed to the scandal</h2> <p>Williams criticises a \u201ctarget-dominated work environment within the immigration system and some low-quality decision making\u201d, which combined with<strong> \u201c</strong>operational and organisational failings\u201d in the department to cause the detrimental treatment meted out to the Windrush generation. Some individual decision-makers operated an \u201cirrational and unreasonable\u201d approach to individuals, demanding multiple documents for proof of presence in the UK for each year of residence in the UK \u2013 despite there being no policy basis for this.</p>",
  "<p>You might think, in a time of global panic like this one, the movements and behaviours of the rich and the famous are rendered dizzyingly irrelevant, candy floss-light non-news designed to distract us from The Great Looming Bug. You\u2019d be right. In many ways, the face of fame is destined to change after all this has blown over: many people we consider famous now, at the start of all this, will no longer be famous when it is done. This is because the machinery that makes them famous \u2013 the movies, the reality shows, the album productions, the photoshoots \u2013 will cease production for months, and the great unseen currency in which the famous trade \u2013 relevance \u2013 will fade alongside it. Like, do we really need \u201cFlorence Pugh\u201d as much as we\u2019ve been pretending we do this last year? Coronavirus will be that acid test.</p> <p>But even when the concept of celebrity ceases being a social function \u2013 you can\u2019t be famous in the wastelands, can you? You can\u2019t \u201cI have 5.5 million Instagram followers\u201d your way out of a feral gang beheading \u2013 I ask you this: knowing you live on a planet where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/17/jared-leto-coronavirus-desert-meditation\">Jared Leto</a> is out there, existing \u2026 do you not think you will be fundamentally curious as to what he is up to? Just to keep track of his movements to ensure he doesn\u2019t tiptoe too close to you, if anything. You want to know what Jared Leto is up to. As long as Jared Leto exists, we simply must know what he is up to. This is the true nature of fame. Leto is a creature so distant, so baffling, we simply must gaze at him in wonder. In any other timeline \u2013 alternate universes shoot off into the infinite where this is broadly true \u2013 we would keep him in a bulletproof tank inside a zoo, and pay tickets to go and look at him. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06e426cc97afd9a1a56e3071db264b25ccc9b859\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06e426cc97afd9a1a56e3071db264b25ccc9b859/0_0_2284_1370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jared Leto illustration\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Anyway Jared Leto news now, andLeto somehow managed to miss the coronavirus news (if you have also somehow missed it, may I gesture at the broad sense of eerie silence loaded with the potential of chaos that surrounds you right now, and maybe suggest you get the Guardian app and turn push notifications \u201con\u201d), and he managed to do so in the most Jared Leto way possible: by being on a silent meditation retreat in the desert. No joke can I write, following that. No point trying. Leto has out-Leto\u2019d Leto. There is no cherry to put atop that sundae. He missed the coronavirus news because he was \u201cthinking\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JaredLeto/status/1239785964169342976\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Wow. 12 days ago I began a silent meditation in the desert.

One that\u2019s been changed for ever. Mind blowing \u2013 to say the least. I\u2019m getting messages from friends and family all around the globe and catching up on what\u2019s going on.\u201d And then \u2013 in one of the most astounding \u201cfamous people\u201d moves I think we\u2019ve seen in 2020 \u2013 Leto, a man who may I remind you learned about coronavirus about 15 minutes ago and is still getting days-old text messages coming through that just say \u201cbro did u die????\u201d \u2013 tweeted some bland coronavirus advice, saying: \u201cHope you and yours are ok. Sending positive energy to all. Stay inside. Stay safe.\u201d Mate, I\u2019ve <em>been</em> staying inside, because I\u2019ve known about coronavirus! Don\u2019t you <em>dare</em> step out of the desert after not talking for 12 days and tell me what to do! </p> <p>I\u2019ve been fascinated by Leto for a long time, because everything he does is shrouded in this inescapable, granular <em>Leto-ness</em>, possibly more than any other celebrity alive. The best Leto story \u2013 before \u201csomehow missing coronavirus because he was so lost in his own thoughts\u201d \u2013 was the filming of <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0488988/\">Chapter 27</a>, where he spent two months packing on 67lb (almost five stone) to play John Lennon\u2019s killer, Mark Chapman, a feat he managed by guzzling microwaved pints of ice cream mixed with olive oil and soy sauce. He put on so much weight for the role that he developed gout and struggled to walk to set every day. Such dedication to a part, you would think, might garner an Oscar nod, or a blockbuster opening weekend, but no: the film opened to generally poor reviews and ultimately grossed less than $200k. The lesson we must learn from this is: if you\u2019re going to put on so much weight for a role that you Henry VIII yourself, it\u2019s broadly advisable to do it for a decent script. It\u2019s arguable that Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s did better out of that film than the distributor did. Maybe that\u2019s what he was thinking about in the desert. I know I\u2019d never stop thinking about that, even for one quiet second of my life.</p> <p>What we need in this time is sources of simple joy, and while some celebrities have stepped up to the plate \u2013 I\u2019m looking at you, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/robbiewilliams/?hl=en\">Robbie Williams</a>, who this week hosted an Instagram Live from his hotel room, resplendently topless, laptop steaming on his duvet, playing his own songs from YouTube, advert pre-roll and all, singing along to them direct to camera, giving his fans an utterly bonkers intimate dream concert because he was isolated from his wife and children, and if his knighthood isn\u2019t assured by that alone then I suggest we storm the castle \u2013 some very much have not, and yes obviously I am talking about Gal Gadot.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Gal Gadot does Imagine\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

There they are, in various gardens and against various blank mansion walls, and in various of those special calamitously bad outfits celebrities wear in the downtime moments when they are not being styled, and we realise how fundamentally useless they all are without help, that they can\u2019t even get dressed properly, and that, truly, a lot of them really are lucky that they\u2019re hot. \u201cWe are in this together, we will get through it together,\u201d Gadot wrote. \u201cLet\u2019s imagine together. Sing with us.\u201d I have to preface this statement with: it\u2019s very nice that they all tried. The sentiment behind it is sincere. But the video itself is the worst thing I\u2019ve ever seen on the internet, and I\u2019ve seen corpses on this thing.</p> <p>Firstly: why do celebrities think them singing a song, badly, is helpful? Do we still blame Band Aid for this? Can <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_6SaRWdJMc\">Bob Geldof saying \u201cgive us your fucking money!\u201d</a> really have had this much of a lasting, shockwave impact on popular culture? And secondly: it\u2019s already getting A Bit Bloody Rich having celebrities cloyingly telling us how important self-isolation is from their labyrinthine, exquisite, sunny Hollywood mansions, is it not? I enjoyed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/16/arnold-schwarzenegger-and-his-tiny-horses-urges-people-to-stay-home\">Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s at-home-with-the-ponies videos</a> as much as anyone, but I don\u2019t have a pony, or a house really, so it\u2019s tougher for me to relate. It\u2019s all well and good for famous people to stay at home where they have a room \u201cjust for clothes\u201d and a swimming pool in their garden, but slightly trickier for the rest of us, worrying about income, grocery levels, having to weapon up to go to Aldi, and whether that ominous cough our housemate seems to have got will somehow, distantly, kill our nan. But yeah please sing more tepid Lennon songs very badly. That\u2019s very helpful, Gal Gadot, and I\u2019m glad you spent the time to do it.</p>",
  "<p>Tony Allen is the most distinctive drummer Africa ever produced, or at least the most distinctive one who made it into a recording studio. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/oct/31/fela-kuti-musical-neil-spencer\">Fela Kuti\u2019s</a> musical director, he was the co-creator of Afrobeat. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/23/hugh-masekela-obituary\">Hugh Masekela,</a> who died in 2018, was the continent\u2019s finest horn player, celebrated for fusing jazz with homegrown South African styles. The pair met in Nigeria in the 70s, when Masekela paid two famously wild visits to Lagos, where he spent most of his time hanging out with Kuti and his band. They played together again in the 80s, before finally getting round to recording in 2010.</p> <p>But only now is their collaboration album, Rejoice, being released. It promises to be one of the African albums of the year, although Allen seems a little bemused. \u201cI thought it had been abandoned,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Not so, says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/apr/10/artsfeatures1\">Nick Gold</a>, who co-produced the recordings: \u201cI knew they wanted to work together. They were going to be in the same place at the same time, so I booked a studio for two days, not to make an album, but to see what would happen. It was just an experiment.\u201d Now, he and Allen have supervised the addition of new bass lines and a dash of keys, vibraphone and extra percussion, while leaving the original work untouched. \u201cI said: \u2018I\u2019m not touching my drums,\u2019\u201d says Allen. \u201c\u2018They\u2019ve been done!\u2019 The feeling was unique with Hugh and I together.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85c0db818acaec9d1939221c8d37514cc9ef9e5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85c0db818acaec9d1939221c8d37514cc9ef9e5c/0_0_3796_2372/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Allen and Hugh Masekela\" width=\"1000\" height=\"625\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Hugh was a funky guy. He had a unique style\u2019 ... Tony Allen and Hugh Masekela in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gavin Rodgers</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What makes Rejoice so special is its brave minimalism \u2013 much of it is drums and bass matched to Masekela\u2019s horn. It brilliantly showcases Allen\u2019s unique talent. Now 80, he is still the go-to drummer for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/apr/07/damon-albarn-gorillaz-heroin-blur\">Damon Albarn</a> and many other younger musicians. Constantly inventive yet never flashy, he has a style that is somehow dominant, but never intrusive. Allen has a deep, quiet voice; when he starts discussing his technique, his hands and feet begin beating out rhythm patterns on the table and the floor, almost instinctively.</p> <p>Masekela and Allen worked out nothing in advance. \u201cI had drum patterns in my mind,\u201d says Allen. \u201cDifferent movements, fast and slow; different structures. I just wanted him to play his trumpet to my patterns.\u201d Masekela obliged, writing melodies on the spot. Much of the set is instrumental, but it includes songs that already sound like Masekela classics. Robbers, Thugs and Muggers is a sturdy clash of South African township styles and west African percussion, while on Never he switches to Afrobeat, with a tribute to the man who brought them together in the chorus: \u201cLagos never gonna be de same \u2013 never! \u2013 without Fela.\u201d</p> <p>Masekela first met Kuti and Allen at an important turning point in his career. He had escaped from apartheid-era South Africa and notched up a hit single, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_S3QOJk90\">Grazing in the Grass</a>, in his new home of the US, but then found himself in trouble. His house in Malibu, California, was raided and he avoided prison on drugs charges only because there had been no proper search warrant. His songs about Vietnam and migrant workers were too extreme for many laid-back 70s audiences, so he moved to west Africa to look for new inspiration. He managed to get funding to record with African musicians, but Allen remembers that the month he spent with Kuti was \u201cwell crazy, smoking the weed and things\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ckbxqrCIc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/d4ckbxqrCIc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Listen to the new single from the album, Never.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>When Masekela returned to Lagos in 1977, the situation was even more crazy. He had been invited to play at <a href=\"https://www.pulse.ng/gist/festac-77-find-out-about-the-twisted-legacy-of-the-great-black-festival/205nmc3\">Festac</a>, a high-profile international festival strongly supported by the military regime of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jun/27/nigeria-olusegun-obasanjo-fighting-corruption\">Olusegun Obasanjo</a>. Kuti refused to take part, Allen says, because he insisted that the government buy copies of a book on African history, <a href=\"http://africaworldpressbooks.com/black-man-of-the-nile-and-his-family-by-dr-yosef-a-a-ben-jochannan/\">The Black Man of the Nile and His Family</a>, and distribute them to all the guests \u2013 which they refused to do.</p> <p>Obasanjo was furious, and became even more angry when he learned that the celebrity Festac guests were spending their time at Kuti\u2019s club, the Shrine. From behind his drum kit, Allen presided over some extraordinary all-night sessions. \u201cHugh Masekela was there, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/oct/19/worldmusic\">Gilberto Gil</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/29/caetano-veloso-review-barbican\">Caetano Veloso</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/05/stevie-wonder-every-studio-album-ranked\">Stevie Wonder</a> \u2013 they would all come to jam,\u201d Allen says. \u201cFela was giving them palm wine to drink. But nothing was recorded. It was live business.\u201d</p> <p>Obasanjo got his revenge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/16/felas-compound-attacked\">when armed troops stormed Kuti\u2019s compound</a>, which he had named the \u201cindependent\u201d Kalakuta Republic; during the attack, Kuti\u2019s mother sustained injuries from which she later died. \u201cThey burned his house down \u2013 he got his arse kicked in the end,\u201d says Allen, who escaped thanks to having a gig at the Shrine that night. \u201cWhen I wasn\u2019t playing, I was always at the Kalakuta. [Working] saved me that day.\u201d</p> <p>Allen had joined Kuti\u2019s band Koola Lobitos in the mid-60s and was a founding member of his legendary Africa \u201970 group in 1969. But in late 1978 he decided to quit, furious that Kuti \u2013 now married to 27 \u201cqueens\u201d \u2013 was becoming increasingly chaotic, owed him money and had failed to respect the musical director who had helped him create Afrobeat\u2019s heady fusion of jazz, funk and African styles.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I could understand Kuti\u2019s militancy. It\u2019s OK challenging the government for their wrongdoings. But what about him?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t stand the lack of organisation,\u201d Allen says. \u201cIf you put everyone together who was working \u2013 band, singers, dancers, management \u2013 there would be 24 to 28 people. But we went on tour with 70 people, so there would be over 40 people in the hotel spending money and doing nothing. And the outstanding money couldn\u2019t be paid \u2013 too many people not working! I could understand what was happening with his militancy. It\u2019s OK challenging the government for their wrongdoings. But what about him?\u201d</p> <p>Allen knows how important he was to Kuti. \u201cWithout me, he is not going to play. If I\u2019m sick, there is no work. But if he\u2019s sick, we could play.

He stayed in Lagos for a while, but by 1984 he had moved to Harlesden in north-west London, where he began gigging with the South African drummer and band leader <a href=\"https://bandonthewall.org/artist/julian-bahulas-jazz-afrika/\">Julian Bahula</a>. Masekela had moved to London, too, \u201cand he came to jam with us and we talked about one day working together. It took 16 years, but everything has its time.\u201d</p> <p>By the time they did eventually record, Allen\u2019s life had changed yet again. He had moved to Paris (he now has French and Nigerian passports) and begun to experiment with new styles, arguing: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be stagnant or bored. It\u2019s evolution. I can\u2019t keep doing the same things.\u201d His 1999 album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/1999/jun/03/artsfeatures\">Black Voices</a>, saw him mixing Afrobeat with dub and electronica. As younger fans began to discover his music, he was given a boost by Damon Albarn, who sang: \u201cTony Allen ... really got me dancing,\u201d on Blur\u2019s 2000 hit Music Is My Radar.</p> <p>Albarn is now \u201clike family \u2013 I love him\u201d; their collaborations have included powerful songs such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-hMkHkoFrU\">Go Back</a> and Allen\u2019s work with the Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen. He says that their second album, 2018\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/nov/16/the-good-the-bad-and-the-queen-merrie-land-review\">Merrie Land</a>, was constructed like Rejoice \u2013 \u201cwritten on my drum patterns in the studio\u201d. His plans for this year include working on what he calls his \u201ctravel album\u201d, playing with young musicians in Nigeria, London, Paris and the US, \u201cbecause I want to take care of youngsters \u2013 they have messages and I want to bring them on my beat\u201d (Albarn may well be involved too).</p> <p>He has organised a tour to promote Rejoice, \u201calong with Hugh\u2019s classics and some of my own stuff\u201d. He will lead a five-piece that will include the South African trumpeter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/nov/14/jazz.shopping1\">Claude Deppa</a>. He says it will be \u201cdifferent from the record. Hugh was a funky guy. He had a unique style.\u201d But he is always keen to get to the next thing, complaining that the release of Rejoice has \u201cinterrupted\u201d his endless flow: \u201cIt\u2019s an obstruction!\u201d</p> <p><em>Rejoice is released on World Circuit on 20 March</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was updated on Wednesday 25 March to clarify that the \u201ctravel album\u201d is a Tony Allen project.</p>",
  "<p>Precisely 73 years ago last week the Football League met to discuss a serious problem that had thrown the entire season into doubt. \u201cThe league are asked in effect to choose between abandoning this season\u2019s championship, which would be a sore blow to the clubs at the head of divisions, or playing on halfway through the summer, or (perhaps the best solution) playing behind closed doors the games needed to conclude the league programme,\u201d the Guardian reported.</p> <p>The circumstances could hardly have been more different, but the dilemma facing football\u2019s governing bodies at that time was identical to that they have been presented with because of coronavirus.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/18/efl-announces-50m-relief-package-for-clubs-in-response-to-coronavirus\">EFL announces \u00a350m relief package for clubs in response to coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On 12 March 1947 the Home Office summoned representatives of the country\u2019s biggest spectator sports, namely football, both rugby codes, horse and greyhound racing, speedway and ice hockey. The government was determined to drive up productivity in British factories as the country tried to get back on its feet after the second world war, and felt that eliminating the distraction of midweek sport would help in that endeavour (cricket was left out because it didn\u2019t distract many people of working age).</p> <p>The problem from football\u2019s perspective was it had been a uniquely vicious winter, with snow still swirling around the country towards the start of spring. On 10 March, the weekend before the government summons, 17 of the 44 scheduled league games were called off; 16 March, the day before executives from the Football League and FA met to discuss the issue, was the seventh consecutive Saturday league fixtures were postponed.</p> <p>\u201cMany grounds are flooded, some are still frozen and others are covered with varying amounts of ice, water and snow,\u201d reported the Guardian. First Division Blackpool had played 34 league games; Sheffield United 26. There was an unprecedented amount of football still to squeeze into the season, and only a few weekends remaining.</p> <p>There was some dissent to the government\u2019s proposals. \u201cThe percentage of the British public who attend midweek sport is infinitesimal,\u201d said the chairman of the Rugby League Council, WH Hughes, who was refused permission to play midweek games after 6pm. Greyhound fans protested outside the Home Office, without success. \u201cThe moral effect on the people [could] be disastrous,\u201d said Will Cearns, the chairman of West Ham and director of Wimbledon Greyhound Stadium. \u201cThe whole idea is incredible. I believe that opinion against a midweek sports ban will be so strong that it will never come into force.\u201d</p> <p>The government held firm, and sport fell into line. Two of the great fixtures on the horse racing calendar \u2013 the Grand National and the Epsom Derby \u2013 moved from their traditional Friday slots to Saturday. The National has stayed there ever since, while the Derby had an extended flirtation with Wednesdays before moving back to the weekend.</p> <p>\u201cAssociated with the problem of completing the fixture list \u2013 which seems insoluble in the circumstances \u2013 is the question of whether to call the big issues of the season \u2013 promotion and relegation \u2013 off, or whether to award the prizes and hand out the penalties despite the differing number of fixtures fulfilled,\u201d wrote JT Bolton in the Observer. \u201cThe null and void line is the one likely to receive the greatest volume of support.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9106130d240a111d13b29472d696e12e07f4c5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9106130d240a111d13b29472d696e12e07f4c5f/0_199_3624_2382/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arsenal score against Manchester United on 1 February 1947\" width=\"1000\" height=\"657\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The harshness of the winter is apparent as Arsenal score against Manchester United on <br>1 February 1947.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Central Press/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They decided instead to extend the season to 14 June, though in fact only two league fixtures were scheduled for June: Sheffield United\u2019s home games against Arsenal, on the seventh, and Stoke a week later. \u201cIt is understood that the possibility of matches behind closed doors was not discussed, and that the meeting did not consider any alternative scheme to the one adopted, which met with unanimous approval,\u201d wrote the Guardian.</p> <p>And so they played on. At the time the decision was made Wolves were four points clear at the top having played a game fewer than Liverpool and four fewer than Blackpool, their nearest challengers, who were divided by goal average. Middlesbrough, Manchester United and Stoke lingered just below.</p> <p>The following weekend the leaders visited the Blades and lost. Over Easter they lost another two games in three days, and for one night dropped to second (albeit one point behind Blackpool with an improbable five games in hand). Other teams were finding form: over Easter Stoke played three games in four days, won them all and kept going. Liverpool lost to Blackpool that Saturday, but then won six of their next seven. By mid-May Wolves led only on goal average, from Manchester United. One point behind them sat Liverpool and Stoke, who had not lost since the decision to extend the season.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the Potters had suffered one significant blow. On 10 May a Great Britain v Rest of Europe match was played at Hampden Park. On the morning of the game Stoke agreed to sell Stanley Matthews to Blackpool \u2013 the papers were signed in the player\u2019s hotel room that evening \u2013 and Stoke went into the most important run of fixtures in their history without their greatest player. The relationship between Matthews and the board had collapsed, and the 32-year-old felt unwanted by the manager, Bob McGrory, who was building a new, young team. Though the original plan had been for him to remain at Stoke until the end of the season \u201cwhen hopefully we would win the championship and negotiations for my move could begin\u201d it unravelled when the press got wind of it.</p> <p>Going into the last day of the month Wolves, Stoke and Liverpool had a game to play, were separated by only a point, and any of them could win the league, while United were second on goal average but had completed their fixtures and were out of the race. Wolves knew victory at home to Liverpool would secure them the title, but any other result would blow the race open. Stoke just had to watch, with their final fixture still a fortnight away. Liverpool were 2-0 up at half-time and held on to win 2-1. Wolves, four points clear on Christmas Day and only once and fleetingly off the top since, were toppled at the last, and Stoke had a fortnight to prepare for the most important game in their history.</p> <p>Two days before the match the players and directors, in their infinite wisdom, travelled to Buxton for the annual <a href=\"http://buxtonwelldressing.co.uk/\">well dressing festival</a>. \u201cAfter lunch the party visited the Pavilion Gardens and pleasantly whiled away the afternoon at bowls, tennis and putting,\u201d reported the Staffordshire Sentinel. \u201cSupporters can rest assured that all the boys will do their utmost to win this most vital match,\u201d said Jock Kirton, the captain, presumably during a short break between unrelated leisure pursuits. Still, Stoke were fully fit while the Blades were without three of their best players and ended up picking Jack Pickering, the 38-year-old club captain, for the only time that season. Pickering set up the final goal in a 2-1 win and instead of taking the title Stoke finished fourth, still their highest league finish.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b43ed448d9d689d914da5590bb6ed65c54d2cd0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b43ed448d9d689d914da5590bb6ed65c54d2cd0/0_262_3618_2172/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The eventual champions Liverpool in action at Chelsea\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The eventual champions Liverpool in action at Chelsea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: JA Hampton/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The match ball was spirited to Merseyside, where it was presented to Liverpool\u2019s hospitalised chairman, William McConnell.

  "<p>Until this week, Chris Day managed Kon-Tiki, a tropical-themed bar and restaurant popular with the after-work crowd in downtown Oakland. On Monday night, that all changed, as the Bay Area came under a shelter-in-place order meant to curb the spread of the coronavirus.</p> <p>Day, 36, along with most of the staff, was laid off immediately.</p> <p>\u201cYou just feel abandoned by the rest of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cBut our federal government doesn\u2019t even want to pay for ventilators for sick people, so obviously we\u2019re not very high on the priority list.\u201d</p> <p>While state and local officials grapple with stemming the exponential increase in Covid-19 cases and life in California has all but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/california-coronavirus-shelter-in-place-bay-area\">ground to a halt</a> over the last week, food service workers and business owners have been some of the first to suffer the immediate impacts.</p> <p>The UCLA Anderson Forecast this week announced the <a href=\"https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/ucla-anderson-forecast-announces-arrival-of-2020-recession-in-revision-of-earlier-forecast\">arrival of recession</a> \u2013 which, it predicted, would hit California harder than the rest of the US. California\u2019s restaurant industry is the largest of any state, with over $70bn in annual revenue. \u201cIt\u2019s a fairly large sector,\u201d said the forecast\u2019s director, the economist Jerry Nickelsburg. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting in the leisure and hospitality sectors, net job loss of about 100,000. So big numbers.\u201d</p> <p>And the impact of immediate economic loss and greater uncertainty is sending ripple effects across the supply chain.</p> <p>The shattered state of the restaurant industry is an early economic indicator as the state and the nation slip into a recession the depth of which is still entirely unknown.</p> <h2><strong>Low wages and high risk</strong></h2> <p>As everyone was laid off at Kon-Tiki, the owners helped their now former employees apply for unemployment benefits.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m lucky enough to have support from my girlfriend and my family right now,\u201d said Day. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have that or if this lasts more than a couple of months, I could be on the street.\u201d</p> <p>Food and drink service is a particularly low-wage, high-risk job sector, with higher rates of mental health and addiction issues, and a large proportion of undocumented workers. Workers who rely heavily on tips for their income may see a shrunken unemployment insurance safety net, as many don\u2019t claim those tips as part of their taxable incomes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"506297eb89e724a39ab6e04b01c29f27b8fc89ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/506297eb89e724a39ab6e04b01c29f27b8fc89ad/0_37_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A worker prepares to-go orders at Creekside Pizza and Taproom in San Anselmo, California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A worker prepares to-go orders at Creekside Pizza and Taproom in San Anselmo, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While hundreds of thousands of other hospitality workers wait to see if they too will be laid off or furloughed, some immediate aid projects are aiming to fill the gap. The Restaurant Workers\u2019 Community Foundation, One Fair Wage Campaign, the California Restaurant Association Foundation and United States Bartenders Guild have all launched loan or aid programs to help.</p> <p>But for Day, they just don\u2019t add up.</p> <p>\u201cThe people who support this industry are amazing. But in the end, it\u2019s a Band-Aid,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not sustainable for something that\u2019s going to go on for a couple of months.\u201d</p> <p>Like some other local small restaurants, Kon-Tiki is continuing take-out and delivery dinner service with a skeleton crew, aiming to salvage what income it can in uncertain times.</p> <p>Sequoia Vennari is hoping take-out will keep her breakfast and lunch cafe Sequoia Diner afloat in East Oakland. But that meant the wrenching decision to let go nine of her 15 employees. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to think strategically because we know that this is not going to be over in two weeks \u2013 it\u2019s probably going to be a couple months,\u201d said Vennari.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/life-under-shelter-in-place-long-lines-empty-roads-panic-buying-cannabis\">Life under 'shelter in place': long lines, empty roads, panic-buying cannabis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The diner is prepping for the week as normal, and then taking consumer demand day by day. \u201cBreakfast is one of those meals that people can just slap together at home but that\u2019s our main revenue. People might not be as willing to throw down on a big breakfast as they were before,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Nancy Chung, owner of the Wooden Nickel pub in San Francisco, laid off her seven cooks and bartenders on Monday, dividing the cash and food she had on hand between them.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I worry about the most for myself and my employees is just not being able to pay rent,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if there\u2019s no eviction and rent is deferred, everybody lives paycheck to paycheck. How will they be able to pay that back when they\u2019ve had no income this whole time?\u201d</p> <p>Chung and other restaurant owners are not optimistic about insurance bridging the gap, as many insurers rejected claims over the 2009 H1N1 outbreak that also saw small restaurants shuttered and hurt by government order.</p> <p>Chung also isn\u2019t optimistic about zero-interest Small Business Association loans as a lifeline. \u201cYou\u2019re just digging yourself into a bigger hole. The likelihood of crawling out of not being open for a few weeks and then to put debt on top of that?\u201d she paused. \u201cBut it\u2019s what we\u2019re going to have to do.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>The ripple effects of struggling restaurants</strong></h2> <p>While small bars and restaurants flounder, the essential shuttering of California\u2019s hospitality industry has sent ripple effects across the supply chain, from people who service and repair kitchen equipment to those who clean restaurants and linens or treat for vermin. And the businesses that themselves support food and drink service are faltering.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f4acc4b7e92aba5ba72ebeb33b0b5a968c07c6f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4acc4b7e92aba5ba72ebeb33b0b5a968c07c6f4/0_0_4818_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Restaurant employees wearing masks look on while waiting for customers in the Haight Ashbury area of San Francisco.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"681\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Restaurant employees wearing masks look on while waiting for customers in the Haight Ashbury area of San Francisco.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Josh Edelson/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Shares in the Texas-based food distributor Sysco foods were down nearly 60% over the last month. A Sysco representative declined to comment. Shares in the Pennsylvania-based food and facilities servicer Aramark were down nearly 75% over the month, suffering a 25% drop on Wednesday alone.</p> <p>\u201cOur employees, if the operations are closed, typically are not paid,\u201d Aramark\u2019s chief executive, John Zillmer, <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/health/coronavirus/aramark-coronavirus-impact-wells-fargo-nhl-nba-20200316.html\">reportedly told investors</a> last week.</p> <p>Julie Figueras is the northern California sales representative for the artisanal spirits importer and producer CNI Brands. Based in Sacramento, Figueras has not yet seen the local shifts that Bay Area and Los Angeles businesses are experiencing, but the larger liquor supply chain has already seized up.</p> <p>\u201cObviously we\u2019re not selling anything, which affects our ability to reach our sales goals \u2013 as a supplier, bonus structure is a huge part of your income,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Bars pay their distributors, which in turn pay importers like CNI, which in turn pay the people who make the products.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re already in conversations with producers overseas. They\u2019re sitting on tons of product that\u2019s just collecting dust. They\u2019ve already paid all that money and they\u2019re just waiting for us to say OK, we\u2019ll take another palette,\u201d said Figueras. \u201cIt\u2019s so crazy how far just closing bars and restaurants really affects business globally. It goes all the way up.\u201d</p> <p>California\u2019s small restaurant scene is dominated by a farm-to-fork ethos, and the small growers that have built their businesses on selling directly to restaurants are now reeling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"88f20637f91fca28cbb5481ef2afc282d095ff19\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88f20637f91fca28cbb5481ef2afc282d095ff19/0_123_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The closed Scoma\u2019s restaurant in Sausalito, California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The closed Scoma\u2019s restaurant in Sausalito, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Risberg/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dirty Girl Produce, a 40-acre organic farm in Santa Cruz, is reworking its business model to compensate for the loss of restaurant business, and starting a new produce delivery and pick-up service direct to consumers \u2013 relying on some of those shuttered restaurants as new distribution hubs.</p> <p>\u201cHalf of what we do is distributing what we grow, and we\u2019re changing that half overnight,\u201d said Joe Schirmer, the owner. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t go heavy in the winter, but we\u2019ve moved our business so we grow year round so we keep people working. We do have a lot going on right now, and a lot of food to sell. The farm workers are allowed to go to work, and they have to. People need food.\u201d<br></p> <h2><strong>A plea for government support</strong></h2> <p>The Los Angeles restaurant owner and consultant Adam Weisblatt is hoping small businesses can rally behind not just a common cause, but a common message and organization, in seeking the relief they so desperately need from government.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how many restaurant owners there are in America, but there\u2019s certainly tens of thousands more than there are CEOs in the airline industry or the cruise industry that are trying to get in on stimulus from Washington,\u201d he said. \u201cSo how do we get in on that? I don\u2019t know yet.\u201d</p> <p>Weisblatt wants to see immediate support for undocumented and low-wage workers, intermediate support for small businesses to keep them afloat to an eventual reopening, and long-term support for change in how government treats small business.</p> <p>\u201cAll these people say small business is the heart of America and it matters so much. But when it comes to actually helping us, there\u2019s no support, there\u2019s never been support, and now it\u2019s worse than ever.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>1) Whilst the rest of the sporting world is shutting down, the relatively low spread of coronavirus in Mexico means that Liga MX was one of the few major global football leagues still playing matches last weekend.

Goalkeeper Mois\u00e9s Mu\u00f1oz was the hero in the shootout, saving Javier Orozco\u2019s effort as Am\u00e9rica won 4-2. Herrera\u2019s celebrations in the rain are also <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOLkUTVT7ko\">quite something</a>.</p> <p>Spare a thought for Cruz Azul. That defeat in 2013 prolonged a wait for a league crown that is still ongoing and stretches back to 1997. La Maquina\u2019s last title was secured in almost equally dramatic and certainly more violent circumstances than their aforementioned loss. In extra time of the league final\u2019s second leg, with Cruz Azul searching for a win after the tie finished 1-1 on aggregate, Le\u00f3n\u2019s Argentine keeper \u00c1ngel Comizzo <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=10&amp;v=sY1A4qFsIls&amp;feature=emb_logo\">chose to reinforce a well-worn clich\u00e9</a>.</p> <p>The Turkish Super Lig is still carrying on, albeit without fans.

Purchases of government bonds and semi-government securities across the yield curve will be conducted to help achieve this target as well as to address market dislocations. These purchases will commence tomorrow.

Further details about the implementation of this are provided in the accompanying notice.</li> \n   <li><strong>A term funding facility for the banking system, with particular support for credit to small and medium-sized businesses. </strong>The Reserve Bank will provide a three-year funding facility to authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADIs) at a fixed rate of 0.25%. ADIs will be able to obtain initial funding of up to 3% of their existing outstanding credit. They will have access to additional funding if they increase lending to business, especially to small and medium-sized businesses. This facility is for at least $90bn. Further details are available in the accompanying notice.The Australian government has also developed a complementary program of support for the non-bank financial sector, small lenders and the securitisation market, which will be implemented by the AOFM.</li> \n   <li><strong>Exchange settlement balances at the Reserve Bank will be remunerated at 10 basis points, rather than zero as would have been the case under the previous arrangements. </strong>This will mitigate the cost to the banking system associated with the large increase in banks\u2019 settlement balances at the Reserve Bank that will occur following these policy actions.</li> \n  </ol> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T03:35:39.185Z\">at 3.35am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e72e77d8f088d7575596269\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T03:31:26.765Z\">3.31am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>More information here:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RBAInfo/status/1240480672759889920\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">At a meeting yesterday, the Reserve Bank Board agreed to a comprehensive package to support the Australian economy through the current challenging period - <a href=\"https://t.co/YYzRnpZGyO\">https://t.co/YYzRnpZGyO</a></p>\u2014 RBA (@RBAInfo) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RBAInfo/status/1240480672759889920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 19, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T03:32:20.523Z\">at 3.32am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e72e71c8f085e564ad86dc8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T03:30:40.548Z\">3.30am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">RBA announcement</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Rates have been cut to a historic low of 0.25%.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T03:31:54.192Z\">at 3.31am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e72e5ab8f085e564ad86dc2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/lorena-allam\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T03:23:46.524Z\">3.23am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Northern Territory is already facing a healthcare crisis, because travel restrictions have severely limited the supply of nurses and doctors to remote areas, so it cannot afford to manage a Covid-19 outbreak, and should enact \u201cspecial isolation measures\u201d immediately.</p> \n  <p>Chief medical officer at central Australian Aboriginal Congress, Dr <strong>John Boffa</strong> has told reporters in Alice Springs that \u201cwe already have a crisis\u201d, because the remote area health corps is so heavily reliant on nurses from interstate and New Zealand, who now cannot travel.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe need reserve nurses and doctors from the army health corps,\u201d Boffa said.</p> \n  <p>Congress and a group of central Australian Aboriginal health and land council leaders are calling for the Northern Territory to declare itself a \u201cspecial controlled area\u201d to keep Covid-19 from spreading.</p> \n  <p>The closure of Uluru-Kata Tjuta national park is under consideration, according to the CEO of the Central Land Council <strong>Joe Martin-Jard</strong>.</p> \n  <p>\u201cMaybe there is a way to accommodate some visitors but in a very controlled way,\u201d Martin-Jard said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIf we are in a special controlled area visitors would need to be quarantined for 14 days.</p> \n  <p>He said the traditional owners were \u201cacutely aware\u201d of the impacts of a closure, so are being careful with the decision.</p> \n  <p>Earlier the NT chief minister <strong>Michael Gunner</strong> said there was some legal complexity about the NT closing itself off, but he would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to keep people safe.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T03:28:43.254Z\">at 3.28am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e72e4288f085c6327bc2b8b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T03:20:07.564Z\">3.20am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The countdown is on for the RBA announcement \u2013 it is due in less than 15 minutes now.</p> \n  <p>Rates are expected to be cut to 0.25%, which the RBA considers to be its floor.

However, pregnant women are potentially at increased risk of complications from any respiratory disease due to the physiological changes that occur in pregnancy. These include reduced lung function, increased oxygen consumption and changed immunity.</p> \n   <p><strong>Currently there is no evidence of an increased risk of miscarriage, teratogenicity or vertical transmission of the Covid-19 virus. There is a possibility of an increased incidence of premature birth but there is insufficient evidence at this point in time</strong>.</p> \n   <p>RANZCOG recommends that, where possible, pregnant healthcare workers be allocated to patients, and duties, that have reduced exposure to patients with, or suspected to have, Covid-19 infection. </p> \n   <p>All personnel should observe strict hygiene protocols and have full access to Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). </p> \n   <p>The college also urges employers to be sensitive to the fact that pregnant women are, appropriately, often anxious about their own health and protective of their unborn baby. Consideration should be given to reallocation to lower-risk duties, working from home or leave of absence.</p> \n   <p>The current circumstances are unprecedented. The community will rely on the medical system to function at the highest level and near 100 percent participation of the medical, nursing and midwifery workforce. Specialist practitioners may need to re-allocate to other areas of the medical system. The college expresses our deep and sincere gratitude to our members, all doctors, nurses, midwives and other health care workers, the administrative staff and management of our hospitals and health services for their dedication, professionalism and compassion.</p> \n   <p>RANZCOG recognises that decisions around resource allocation are complex, and multifactorial, and defers to local jurisdictions in this regard.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T00:58:10.170Z\">at 12.58am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e72bf428f085e564ad86ca7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/melissa-davey\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T00:39:43.405Z\">12.39am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The <strong>Australian Health Protection Principal Committee</strong>, comprised of all chief health officers and chaired by the chief medical officer, <a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/news/australian-health-protection-principal-committee-ahppc-coronavirus-covid-19-statement-on-17-march-2020\">has published</a> the rationale behind its latest recommendations, including that schools remain open for now. Of course, this advice may change \u2013 school closures are not permanently off the table.</p> \n  <p>The committee says there is currently l<strong>imited information on the contribution of children to transmission of Covid-19</strong>. The World Health Organization found in China 2.4% of total reported cases were under the age of 19 years old. Worldwide, very few cases of infection in children have been severe or critical. The committee says;</p> \n  <p><em>\u201cThis contrasts distinctly with the severity pattern observed with other respiratory viruses, where young children are particularly at risk of severe disease.<br><br>\u201cPrevious studies suggest that the potential reduction in community transmission from pre\u2011emptive school closures may be offset by the care arrangements that are in place for children who are not at school. <strong>Children may require care from older carers who are more vulnerable to severe disease, or may continue to associate (and transmit infection) outside of school settings.</strong><br><br>\u201cBroadly, the health evidence on school closures from previous respiratory epidemics shows the costs are often underestimated and the benefits are overestimated. This may be even more so in relation to Covid-19 as, unlike influenza, the impact on otherwise healthy children has been minimal to date.<br><br>\u201cSchool closure is associated with considerable costs. S<strong>tudies have estimated that around 15% of the total workforce and 30% of the healthcare workforce may need to take time off work to care for children.

New Zealand citizens who live in Australia as Australian residents will also be exempt, as will New Zealanders transiting to New Zealand. The government says exemptions for Pacific Islanders transiting to their home countries will continue to apply.</p> \n<p>The government is in discussions with airlines about continuing some international flights for the purpose of bringing Australians back from overseas, and for continuing the movement of goods and freight.</p> \n<p>The RBA on Thursday committed to providing a three-year funding facility worth at least $90bn \u2013 a measure that will allow banks to lend to small business through the economic downturn. The government unveiled a synchronised measure allocating another $15bn so small banks and credit unions can supply low-cost loans to consumers and small business.</p> \n<p>Morrison described the unprecedented intervention as \u201ca very significant injection to support Australians, to support our economy, to support business, to support jobs, as we all go across on this bridge together to the other side, where on the other side we know that the Australian economy will be stronger, Australians will be healthier and Australian life can return to what we knew it to be.\u201d</p> \n<p>Frydenberg said the intervention had a simple purpose: \u201cTo decrease the cost of credit and to increase its flow.\u201d</p> \n<p>The difficult conditions triggered by the pandemic were underscored early on Thursday when Australia\u2019s national carrier Qantas <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/19/coronavirus-qantas-and-jetstar-to-suspend-international-flights-and-stand-down-20000-workers\">said it would stand down two-thirds of its 30,000-strong workforce</a> without pay and end international flights \u2013 a decision that came despite a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/18/australian-airline-industry-to-receive-715m-rescue-package\">$715m rescue package</a> for the Australian airline sector, unveiled by the Morrison government on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>The government also implemented new restrictions on the sale of medicines in an effort to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/paracetamol-and-ventolin-limited-to-one-per-customer-as-australia-combats-coronavirus-hoarding\">head off hoarding and panic buying in pharmacies</a>.</p>",

  "<p>The disease known as the \u201cSpanish flu\u201d was first reported in North America in January 1918 in Kansas. By the time owners and organizers began to prepare for the league\u2019s second season, the flu was becoming a specter. Due to the virus, only three delegates were able to attend an October 1918 meeting that was required to transfer team ownership and settle on the final number of teams in the league. That same month, Hamby Shore, a star player for the Ottawa Senators, died from the Spanish flu. The rest of the fall would see deaths across sports in North America: a famous curler in Manitoba, an American League umpire in Boston, the president of the Alberta branch of the AAU, the secretary of the Montreal City Amateur Hockey League and the Eastern Hockey Association.</p> <p>News about the league planning for its season was printed next to columns advising citizens to wash their hands, keep healthy diets and find cures for the flu in nature. \u201cEvidence seems to prove that this is a germ disease, spread principally by human contact, chiefly through coughing, sneezing or spitting,\u201d the Leader-Telegram in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, wrote. \u201cSo avoid persons having colds \u2013 which means avoiding crowds \u2013 common drinking cups, roller towels, etc.\u201d Bowling alleys, the sites of competitive tournaments, were mandated to close. \u201cI understand that preparations are being made for different rugby and other games this week,\u201d Toronto health officer Dr Charles Hastings said. \u201cThese games must be discontinued. They only jeopardize people\u2019s lives. It is inconceivable that the people in charge of them have not more judgment.\u201d</p> <p>Still, NHL play began on 21 December 1918, in part because of the minimal crowds it drew compared to today. (Attendance numbers from 1918-19 aren\u2019t readily available, but for context, in 1926-27, Ottawa averaged 85 fans per game.) At the time, the NHL season was divided into two 10-game halves, and only three teams would compete: the Senators, the Montreal Canadiens and the Toronto Arenas. The Canadiens won the season\u2019s first half, finishing with a 7-3 record. The defending Stanley Cup champions, Toronto, struggled, winning three games in the first half. By the time they announced their intention to shutter amid chaos behind the scenes after 17 games, they had logged only two more wins. NHL president Frank Calder convinced the Arenas to hold on for an 18th game, but that was as far as they \u2013 or the regular season \u2013 would go. The league pivoted, announcing that Montreal would face Ottawa in a seven-game series to determine which team would advance to play the Pacific Coast Hockey Association champions in the Stanley Cup final.</p> <p>Montreal won that series, four games to one. In the one game they lost, fans of the Senators threw lemons and turnips onto the ice, aiming for Montreal\u2019s Bert Corbeau, who had levied a hit against one of the Ottawa players. Still, Ottawa couldn\u2019t make a comeback in the series, and the Canadiens players packed their bags for Seattle, where the series would be played against the hometown Metropolitans. Seattle had an interesting journey of their own to the final. They had faced the Vancouver Millionaires in a two-game playoff without their star player, Bernie Morris, who was arrested for draft dodging hours before the start of the series. They still squeezed through 7-5 on aggregate.</p> <p>Now it was time for the finals. The Metropolitans blew out the Canadiens 7-0 in Game 1, before Montreal won Game 2. Seattle were on top after Game 3, and after a scoreless tie in Game 4, the Canadiens came back to win Game 5, tying the series at 2-2-1. But in the Montreal dressing room after the game, emotions were mixed. Despite winning, the team had lost one of their best players early in the game. Veteran defenseman Joe Hall had collapsed on the ice.</p> <p>The teams had two off days scheduled between Games 5 and 6, and during that break, players on both squads started to experience flu-like symptoms. Hall was already hospitalized, suspected of being infected and with a temperature of 104F (40C), and the Montreal roster was hit harder than Seattle\u2019s. By the day of Game 6, four more Canadiens players and the team\u2019s general manager, George Kennedy, had joined Hall in hospital.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bec1b5f49af5e0bab18a8761a27c7c6364ce4929\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bec1b5f49af5e0bab18a8761a27c7c6364ce4929/0_792_3987_2392/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Seattle was the venue for the 1919 Stanley Cup\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Seattle was the venue for the 1919 Stanley Cup.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To the public, it still seemed unimaginable that the next game would be postponed or the series canceled. The day before Game 6, oddsmakers gave Seattle a slight edge, and behind the scenes, the two teams were working on contingencies should players still be sidelined. Montreal had tried to simply forfeit the series, but the Seattle general manager, Pete Muldoon, didn\u2019t want to win the Stanley Cup under those circumstances. Muldoon suggested Montreal try to enlist players from the Victoria Aristocrats, who played just across the water from Seattle in British Columbia. The idea was a stretch, and Calder rejected it. By then, the puck was scheduled to drop in just five hours, and the teams had run out of solutions. Seattle still refused the Montreal forfeit, and the series was simply canceled.</p> <p>The Canadiens remained in Seattle, waiting for their players and general manager to recover. Little information circulated about the players\u2019 condition, but the Winnipeg Tribune reported that Kennedy\u2019s condition was worsening. His wife was on her way from Montreal to Seattle, and the paper said that the team was considering chartering a train to take everyone, invalids included, back home.</p> <p>The train journey never happened. Kennedy\u2019s wife made her way west, and most of the Canadiens began to improve. One did not: Hall. He\u2019d contracted pneumonia as a result of the flu, and on 5 April 1919 he died in the Columbia Sanitarium in Seattle. His mother was at his bedside, but his wife and children were nearly 1,300 miles away in Brandon, Manitoba. Hall was 37 years old.</p> <p>\u201cJoe Hall loved hockey so much that his death, practically in harness, would, without a doubt, have been the death he would have chosen were it within the power of human beings to so choose,\u201d the Vancouver Sun wrote the day after his death. \u201cWhenever Joe Hall played a game of hockey he played it for all he was worth. Though not a big player physically, the severest knocks never dampened his ardor. As recently as in the recent world\u2019s series he was hit on the face a terrific crack with the puck, and though it could be seen that he was suffering he kept right on as if nothing had happened.\u201d</p> <p>Hall was eulogized in papers across Canada, where he\u2019d spent most of his life after emigrating with his family from England as a toddler. The Winnipeg Tribune called him \u201cone of the greatest exponents of the hockey game,\u201d and a \u201cremarkable and brilliant athlete.\u201d It continued: \u201cJoe never spared himself while in a game; he always gave his best and never hesitated to mix things. It is a wonder that a player who received so many hard jolts and slashes as he did, could continue in the game for so long.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mgweissman/status/1238080212979658752\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">ICYDK, there is precedence for something like this re: NHL cancelling games. 1919 Stanley Cup Final was shutdown after 5 games re: Spanish flu epidemic.

Scientists have calculated that Greenland\u2019s enormous ice sheet lost an average of 268bn tons of ice between 2002 and 2019 \u2013 less than half of what was shed last summer. By contrast, Los Angeles county, which has more than 10 million residents, consumes 1bn tons of water a year.</p> <p>\u201cWe knew this past summer had been particularly warm in Greenland, melting every corner of the ice sheet, but the numbers are enormous,\u201d said Isabella Velicogna, a professor of Earth system science at University of California Irvine and lead author of <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020GL087291\">the new study</a>, which drew upon measurements taken by Nasa\u2019s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (Grace) satellite mission and its upgraded successor, Grace Follow-On.</p> <p>Glaciers are melting away around the world due to global heating caused by the human-induced climate crisis. Ice is reflective of sunlight so as it retreats the dark surfaces underneath absorb yet more heat, causing a further acceleration in melting.</p> <p>Ice is being lost from Greenland seven times faster than it was in the 1990s, scientists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/10/greenland-ice-sheet-melting-seven-times-faster-than-in-1990s\">revealed last year</a>, pushing up previous estimates of global sea level rise and putting 400 million people at risk of flooding every year by the end of the century.</p> <p>More recent research has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/11/polar-ice-caps-melting-six-times-faster-than-in-1990s\">found</a> that Antarctica, the largest ice sheet on Earth, is also losing mass at a galloping rate, although the latest University of California and Nasa works reveals a nuanced picture.</p> <p>\u201cIn Antarctica, the mass loss in the west proceeds unabated, which is very bad news for sea level rise,\u201d Velicogna said. \u201cBut we also observe a mass gain in the Atlantic sector of east Antarctica caused by an increase in snowfall, which helps mitigate the enormous increase in mass loss that we\u2019ve seen in the last two decades in other parts of the continent.\u201d</p> <p>The research has further illustrated the existential dangers posed by runaway global heating, even as the world\u2019s attention is gripped by the coronavirus crisis. Crucial climate talks are set to be held later this year in Glasgow, although the wave of cancellations triggered by the virus has threatened to undermine this diplomatic effort.</p> <p>\u201cThe technical brilliance involved in weighing the ice sheets using satellites in space is just amazing,\u201d said Richard Alley, a glaciologist at Penn State University who was not involved in the study.</p> <p>\u201cIt is easy for us to be distracted by fluctuations, so the highly reliable long data sets from Grace and other sensors are important in clarifying what is really going on, showing us both the big signal and the wiggles that help us understand the processes that contribute to the big signal.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Solitude is not the same as loneliness. Lonely people feel the need for company, while solitary types seek to escape it. The neatest definition of loneliness, David Vincent writes in his superb new study, is \u201cfailed solitude\u201d. Another difference between the two groups is that hermits, anglers, Trappist monks and Romantic poets choose to be alone, whereas nobody chooses to feel abandoned and bereft. Calling yourself \u201cself-partnering\u201d, meaning that you sit in the cinema (should they be open) holding your own hand, may be either a genuine desire for solitude or a way of rationalising the stigma of isolation. The greatest difference of all, however, is that solitude has rarely killed anyone, whereas loneliness can drive you to the grave. As the coronavirus rampages, some of us might now face a choice between physical infection and mental breakdown.</p> <p>For the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2001/jun/12/artsandhumanities.highereducation\" title=\"\"> 18th-century Enlightenment</a>, being on your own was a deviation from the true nature of humanity, which was sociable to its core. It was with the Romantics that this began to change. Isolation was now what we shared in common. Frankenstein\u2019s monster is one of the first great loners of English literature, spurned and vilified by humanity. Yet though loneliness was a symptom of the modern era, solitude could be a critique of it. It was one of the few ways in which you could get in touch with the transcendent, thus revealing what was lacking in an increasingly materialistic society. When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jan/26/william-wordsworth-wandered-lonely-as-a-cloud\" title=\"\">Wordsworth writes that he wandered lonely as a cloud</a>, he may mean simply that he was by himself, or that he lacked companionship, or that being alone allowed him space for self-knowledge and spiritual meditation.</p> <p>That the self is revealed only in retreat from the world is a belief which runs back at least to the early <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/06/hermits-solitude-wilderness-new-mexico\" title=\"\">Christian desert fathers</a>, but this book shows how the need for self-communion intensifies as modern societies become more crowded. Such withdrawal could come at a cost: Virginia Woolf insisted on the need for a room of one\u2019s own, but only the upper middle classes could have afforded one at the time. In the 19th century, only 1% of the British population lived on their own; in 2011 it was 31%, or some 8 million people. Yet as urbanisation and large families pitched people together, the anonymous world of industrial capitalism also split them apart. Rural life may have been rough, but at least you knew who lived next door. So if a longing to be alone became more acute, so did a sense of being forsaken.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"72ab0f91ace4676b7f6dcebab1804c237407c2ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72ab0f91ace4676b7f6dcebab1804c237407c2ea/692_173_1606_1937/829.jpg\" alt=\"John Clare, engraving, after Hilton.\" width=\"829\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Clare, engraving, after Hilton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Edward Gooch/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>A History of Solitude</em> calls for a \u201cquiet history of British society\u201d, or \u201ca history of doing nothing at all\u201d. It is a remarkably versatile study, ranging from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/09/john-clare-poetry\" title=\"\">poetry of John Clare </a>to the \u201cnetworked solitude\u201d of the internet and the cult of mindfulness. There is a fascinating section on solitary walking, which the 19th-century middle classes indulged in for spiritual recreation (Wordsworth is reckoned to have walked some 180,000 miles during his lifetime), and the labouring classes undertook in order to find work. Constant perambulation was what united peasant and patrician.</p> <p>One can, of course, be solitary in company. In fact, the psychologist Donald Winnicott claims that a child can learn to be alone only in the presence of a trusted adult. The second half of the 19th century witnessed a rash of new convents, where women could be alone together, while a less high-minded form of solitary confinement was provided by the prison system. (The yachtsman Robin Knox-Johnson thought the crime rate might fall if people were sentenced to sail around the world alone instead of going to gaol.) A cameo on smoking shows how in the postwar era the habit was seen less as a route to the churchyard than as a pathway to inner calm, even as a variety of prayer.</p> <p>Vincent has his doubts about the so-called epidemic of loneliness in modern life. He points out that more and more men and women after the second world war decided to live alone because it was feasible to do so. In any case, widespread loneliness isn\u2019t new, and some sociologists see little evidence that it is on the increase. By contrast, Fay Bound Alberti\u2019s <em>A Biography of Loneliness</em> approaches the issue with a deeper sense of urgency. If Vincent is a social historian, she is an emotional one, convinced that human feelings, far from being timeless and universal, are as historically conditioned as thought and action, and every bit as mutable. The case can be challenged: the way we express emotion is certainly shaped by our culture, but grieving over the loss of a loved one, or panicking when embraced by a grizzly bear, don\u2019t seem to depend on whether you come from Kansas or Cambodia. It is equally doubtful that all emotional states are gendered, as this book maintains. Do women really react differently to men when falling off a mountain? \u201cAll emotions are political,\u201d Alberti asserts, but \u201ceverything is political\u201d statements risk emptying the term \u201cpolitical\u201d of any useful meaning. It represents an overreaction to those who think that the post of lord chancellor isn\u2019t political but natural.</p> <p>Even so, this is a compassionate, wide-ranging study, which makes the bold claim that loneliness was invented around 1800. This may help to explain why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/30/100-best-books-robinson-crusoe\" title=\"\">Robinson Crusoe </a>doesn\u2019t once complain of lacking company. It also chimes with Vincent\u2019s case: in his view, \u201clonely\u201d becomes a negative emotion only around this time. It is now less a fact (\u201con one\u2019s own\u201d) than an existential condition, as with Byron\u2019s gloomy heroes. Today, Alberti argues, lonely people are 30% more likely to die early than less lonely ones, the poor are lonelier than the well-off and the young are the loneliest of all. To be lonely is to cease \u201cto exist in a meaningful way with other people\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3a33c19d3734b3c441732f7facb633c85b6c701\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3a33c19d3734b3c441732f7facb633c85b6c701/0_265_4293_2576/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gillian Anderson as Miss Havisham in the BBC adaptation of Great Expectations.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gillian Anderson as Miss Havisham in the BBC adaptation of <em>Great Expectations</em>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicola Dove/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s a gripping account here of Queen Victoria\u2019s pathological grief over Prince Albert\u2019s death, which compares the stricken monarch with the surreal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/dec/27/great-expectations-review-sam-wollaston\" title=\"\">Miss Hav</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/dec/27/great-expectations-review-sam-wollaston\" title=\"\">isham of Dickens\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/dec/27/great-expectations-review-sam-wollaston\" title=\"\">Great Expectations</a></em>. The book is impressively balanced: it sees that loneliness, in the sense of Vincent\u2019s \u201csolitude\u201d, can be the price one pays for creativity. Loneliness can be restorative as well as destructive, but only when it is a choice. Historically speaking, it springs from the separation of self and society; but this long pre-dates 1800, as Hamlet or Othello might testify. Overlooking this fact, the book idealises the 18th century as a \u201crelatively collective world\u201d, which would have come as something of a surprise to the vagrants and workless who wandered its highways.</p> <p>All the same, Alberti is right to politicise loneliness, unlike the neuroscientists who are racing to develop a pill to cure it. One can\u2019t dissociate feeling useless and disconnected from the history of possessive individualism, even if that history stretches further back than the author imagines. If, as she points out, \u201cthere are very few physical spaces where people can meet in the 21st century without paying for the privilege of being there\u201d, it is largely because the gospel of neoliberalism can see no point in them. There is, then, a villain in this book, as there isn\u2019t in the more cautious reflections of Vincent. But there is also a good deal more: a brief history of old age, speculations on homelessness, refugees, soul mates, hunger artists and Fomo, the connections between loneliness and obesity, a digression on <em>Wuthering Heights</em> which fails to drive home what an utter bastard Heathcliff is, and an array of other topics.</p> <p>What distinguishes both these studies is their mixture of empirical research and general commentary. Both recount a grand narrative about solitude or loneliness, unfolding across the centuries, but they do so on the basis of detailed documentation. In their combination of scholarship and sympathy, poetry and clinical psychology, they appeal as much to the common reader as to the expert. One answer to loneliness is solitude. Enjoying being on one\u2019s own, or at least being able to tolerate it, is part of being grown up. But Vincent and Alberti both highlight the privilege this involves \u2013 how positive aloneness is possible for the middle-class poet, but not for the impoverished housewife with children to care for, not least in a society which has hacked social provision to the bone.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>A History of Solitude</em> will be published by Polity on 24 April (RRP \u00a325). <em>A Biography of Loneliness</em> is out from Oxford (RRP \u00a320).

  "<p>You can learn a lot about someone\u2019s perspective from what they find reassuring at a time like this. This week I saw a private briefing from a bank, soothingly reassuring its clients that \u201cthis feels more like 9/11 than 2008\u201d. I think the point was to let investors know that this crisis is not systemic. It felt a bit like updating the old wartime spirit for today\u2019s hyper-capitalist economy: \u201cKeep well-capitalised, and carry on.\u201d</p> \n<p>I can think of a host of reasons why 9/11 does not bring calming thoughts to mind, but one is the long-term impact it had on human rights. Back then I was in the early stages of becoming a human rights lawyer. My very first day in court was with the team defending a victim of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/03/humanrights.terrorism\" title=\"\">extraordinary rendition</a>, where Britain had helped facilitate his torture. By the time I was practising, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/28/77-london-bombings-10th-anniversary-terror-attacks\" title=\"\">7 July London bombings</a> had happened, and so had draconian new laws \u2013 90-day detention without trial, plus sweeping surveillance and monitoring. Many Muslims remember this as the time that racial profiling and state harassment \u2013 in airports, on the tube, in the street \u2013 became the new normal.</p> \n<p>This might sound like a strange issue to raise when the national priority is \u2013 understandably \u2013 how to stop the spread of coronavirus, treat the sick and tackle the hit to the economy. But since last month, when the government drafted emergency regulations to grant police new powers \u2013 and more far-reaching laws are expected this week \u2013 the potential has been building for a clash between liberty, privacy and public health measures. The authorities now have the power to arrest and detain someone they believe is infectious for up to 14 days, to move that person around from custody facilities including secure hospitals, and to take blood or saliva from them by force, even if they are a child.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/18/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-pmqs-cbi-urges-government-pay-businesses-directly-saying-350bn-loangrant-package-not-enough\">UK coronavirus live: all schools in UK to close from Friday; A-levels and GCSEs cancelled</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/129/contents/made\" title=\"\">legislation</a> set to come before parliament is likely to ban public gatherings, to widen police and immigration officer powers of detention and restraint, to give doctors powers to sign death certificates without seeing the deceased person\u2019s body, to allow fast-tracked burial and cremation, and to strip back services in care homes. People who refuse to self-isolate could be made to do so using the always contested \u201creasonable force\u201d.</p> \n<p>Our human rights protections \u2013 long maligned by many of the politicians now running our pandemic-stricken nation \u2013 were designed for moments such as this.

One QC compared the idea to Germany\u2019s post-9/11 attempt to permit hijacked passenger planes to be shot down, as if the lives of those on board were expendable. Similarly, he suggests, the very idea of herd immunity would have \u201c<a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/will-johnsons-coronavirus-response-be-overthrown-eu-courts/\" title=\"\">subordinated human dignity</a> by treating it as a quantifiable entity that can be measured and weighed in the balance.\u201d</p> \n<p>There\u2019s the potential for a kind of tyranny of the majority \u2013 one of the reasons we need human rights in the first place \u2013 and then there are the new, established but upgraded, tyrannies of the state. China has developed an app of remarkably intrusive proportions, using facial recognition to track both your movements and those of everyone in your proximity, so that they can be tested in the event you become infectious.</p> \n<p>Israel is ditching superfluous apps altogether and simply allowing security services to hack infected people\u2019s phones to monitor their movements.</p> \n<p>Donald Trump has insisted on a project of deliberate racial demonisation by calling Covid-19 the \u201cChinese virus\u201d \u2013 inflaming what we already know to be harmful prejudice against east Asian people, including those who have suffered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/27/coronavirus-panic-uk-hostile-environment-east-asians\" title=\"\">shameful abuse</a> in Britain. In one of the most surreal responses to the pandemic, commentators who are usually allergic to this form of social justice have belatedly discovered the concept of reparations \u2013 not for the genocidal abuses committed by Europeans over the centuries, but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattwridley/status/1239627378307055616\" title=\"\">for Europeans</a> from the allegedly guilty Chinese. </p> \n<p>The truth is that China has been remarkably effective at stemming the spread of Covid-19, but has done so through a heady concoction of human rights abuses and authoritarian rule, of which no one should be envious. Human Rights Watch <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/03/12/human-toll-chinas-coronavirus-control-efforts\" title=\"\">has reported</a> censorship; dissenters put \u201cunder quarantine\u201d; a disabled child left to die when his parent was forced into isolation; and a leukaemia sufferer turned away from hospital. </p> \n<p>That doesn\u2019t justify racism against Chinese people any more than the British should be stigmatised for the uniquely dodgy leadership we currently endure. This pandemic has exposed what many of us said about the Tories\u2019 long boast of \u201crecord high\u201d numbers of people in employment \u2013 namely, insecure workers with no rights and no safety net. Likewise, we warned about starving the NHS so that its resilience is shot, creating a generation of renters with no savings, and allowing homelessness and destitution to mushroom.</p> \n<p>These casualties had already become the new normal. But once we see newly troubling scenes \u2013 people arrested for resisting isolation or treatment \u2013 we will be reminded why this could become a crisis of rights, as much as it is one of disease.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Afua Hirsch is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>The Trump administration is putting the health and potentially lives of thousands of federal judges, lawyers, court staff and undocumented immigrants and their families at risk by insisting that immigration courts remain open for the deportation hearings of detained immigrants, despite the threat of coronavirus.</p> <p>On Wednesday the Department of Justice <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DOJ_EOIR/status/1240124718298038273\">announced</a> the temporary closure of 10 immigration courts in addition to the already shuttered location in Seattle. All deportation hearings relating to undocumented people who are not in custody have also been suspended.</p> <p>But a rare alliance of federal employees including immigration judges, Ice prosecutors and lawyers representing immigrants are saying the changes are too little, too late. With 58 immigration courts still open across the country, and only 11 closed, the prospect of courthouses acting as incubators and disseminators of the virus remains pronounced, with the risk of spreading the disease to large numbers of federal employees and the public.</p> <p>A judge working out of the immigration court in Denver, Colorado, is understood to have contracted Covid-19. The Denver court is one of the 58 ordered to remain open.</p> <p>Judge Samuel Cole, communications director of the National Association of Immigration Judges (NAIJ), told the Guardian that the new restrictions were helpful but not enough. \u201cThere are still hearings going on across the country in courts that need to be closed because they are a public safety hazard.\u201d</p> <p>Staff in federal courts have been making increasingly desperate appeals to the Trump administration to abide by the guidelines set by its own disease control agency and temporarily close all immigration courts. But they have repeatedly been told that hearings must continue.</p> <p>It appears that amid the crisis over the coronavirus pandemic, Donald Trump is putting his desire to stand tough on immigration in an election year ahead of protecting the lives of government workers and the public. The instruction to keep going with immigration removal hearings of detained individuals issued by the DoJ has come from the top of the Trump administration, court employees have been told.</p> <p>Yet the approach directly conflicts with the guidance given by the government\u2019s own disease control agency. <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/Seattle_Community_Mitigation.pdf\">Latest advice</a> from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that individuals at risk of severe illness if they contract Covid-19 should avoid gatherings of 10 or more people. It also says that workplaces should \u201cencourage staff to telework\u201d.</p> <p>Yet deportation hearings for detained immigrants which frequently have 15 or so people holed up in closed-air courtrooms for several hours, must now carry on.</p> <p>\u201cPrioritizing politics above all else is incompatible with the principles of due process and is a danger to the health and security of all involved,\u201d Judge Ashley Tabaddor, president of the NAIJ, said before the new restrictions came into effect.</p> <p>Among the 10 courts that have been closed are three located in New York City that are among the busiest in the country. Court staff have been trying for days to persuade management to let them telework from home in line with CDC advice.</p> <p>A whistleblower working in the New York City immigration courts has shared with the Guardian details of how basic CDC guidelines have been flouted every day in the city\u2019s three immigration courts. Even after the announcement was made on Wednesday that the courts were closing, federal staff were told that they had to come into work for the rest of the week to \u201cassist with an orderly shutdown\u201d.</p> <p>The whistleblower said they were relieved the courts were being shuttered but they remained angry at how the issue has been handled. \u201cAt every turn when we brought up our concerns, management has downplayed and deflected responsibility. We could have been exposed for days, even weeks.\u201d</p> <p>They added: \u201cThere is no other reasonable explanation to risk these many people\u2019s lives other than that the Trump administration hates immigrants so much they want to get rid of them. That is abhorrent to me.\u201d</p> <p>In recent days members of the public have been showing up at the New York courts looking visibly unwell. Yet only the most basic hygiene measures have been taken, the whistleblower said.</p> <p>Security guards have been instructed to wipe surfaces clean in courtrooms and waiting rooms where suspected coronavirus cases have been present. \u201cThat\u2019s the extent of the deep-cleaning of immigration courts,\u201d the whistleblower said.</p> <p>Around the country, courts that must remain open to hear detained deportation cases are already experiencing shortages of cleaning supplies to sanitize courtrooms forcing federal employees to provide their own. Interpreters needed to translate for immigrants in removal hearings were being flown from high-risk areas where Covid-19 is already prevalent such as New York to less at-risk states, thereby potentially spreading the disease.</p> <p>\u201cThat contradicts everything we are being told by health experts and the CDC,\u201d said Judge Amiena Khan, NAIJ\u2019s executive vice-president. \u201cHow in God\u2019s name is flying interpreters around the country helping to combat this global pandemic?\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this week the unions and professional bodies of immigration judges, Ice prosecutors and lawyers representing undocumented clients issued a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6811831-Immigration-Letter.html\">joint statement</a> calling for the immediate suspension for up to a month of all of the nation\u2019s 68 immigration courts. The groups called the measures taken so far \u201cwoefully insufficient \u2026 The DOJ is failing to meet its obligations to ensure a safe and healthy environment within our immigration courts.\u201d</p> <p>Federal employees are being asked to make unconscionable choices, as illustrated by the battles waged in the New York courts. The whistleblower personally has a respiratory condition that means that were they to contract the virus they could be in mortal danger.</p> <p>Numerous requests to telework from home had been turned down, forcing the whistleblower to travel into court every day on the New York subway \u2013 a perilous exercise in itself. Yet they feel unable to disobey because if they lost their job they would also lose healthcare coverage which would make them all the more vulnerable.</p> <p>\u201cThe choice that all of us federal employees are being presented is you come to work and you get healthcare coverage or you start taking days off and your supervisor doesn\u2019t like it and you risk being fired without healthcare coverage,\u201d they said.</p>",

On Thursday, Korea\u2019s Kospi fell nearly 9%; India\u2019s currency hit a record low (and its central bank has pledged to buy a huge amount of bonds on Friday); the Philippines stock market slumped as much as 24% at one point and has lost more than a third of its value this year; Australia\u2019s market fell by 3.4%; Japan\u2019s Nikkei was down 1%.</p>",

  "<p>We must act, said Boris Johnson on Tuesday, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/enemy-deadly-boris-johnson-invokes-wartime-language-coronavirus\">like any wartime government</a>\u201d. The measures to control the population, he added, were \u201cunprecedented since world war two\u201d. Rishi Sunak, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/17/rishi-sunak-pledges-350bn-to-tackle-coronavirus-impact\">speaking later</a>, announced, \u201cWe have never, in peacetime, faced an economic fight like this one.\u201d</p> <p>The second world war remains the foundation myth of modern Britain. Invoking it is a familiar default setting in British party politics. It has a Conservative version, embodied in Churchill, with whom Johnson compares himself. And it has its Labour version, in the form of veneration of Attlee and the post-1945 welfare state. The war still suffuses much of the national culture. It can sometimes be an inspiration. But it can sometimes, indeed more often, be a curse.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The playbooks of this peacetime effort will have striking comparisons with the playbooks of distant wartimes</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That is not true today, however. Johnson and Sunak are right to compare the coronavirus crisis with the wartime emergencies of the 20th century. We are all doing it. These are the only meaningful reference points for the totalising crisis that suddenly faces this and other nations. Government and society are now in a very new place. As Johnson put it this week: \u201cThe state is asking people to make very considerable changes to their lives. And it is only right therefore that the state should stand behind people as they make those changes.\u201d</p> <p>It is 75 years since a British prime minister talked in such terms. For most of the past 50, such remarks were effectively anathema, especially in the Tory party. And yet, although the transformation of the role of government in less than two weeks has been genuinely jaw-dropping, this is not yet the same as a wartime crisis in some very important ways. These differences need to be understood, not least because it may help to avoid the error, long familiar in military strategy, of mistakenly setting out to fight the last war rather than tackling the one that we actually face.</p> <p>Start with the blindingly obvious. Britain in 2020 is not the Britain of 1939, let alone the Britain of 1914. We are an infinitely more connected, more individualistic and more informed society today than we were then. These realities cannot be ignored, though they may change. They will set the initial terms of what is politically possible. The playbooks of this peacetime effort will have striking comparisons with the playbooks of those distant wartimes, but there will be striking differences too.</p> <p>You can see this in Johnson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/18/boris-johnson-covid-19-response\">reluctance to prohibit things</a> that will soon need to be stopped. Much of that will surely change and be tightened, and rightly so. The same is true of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/17/chancellors-330bn-coronavirus-package-is-big-but-not-big-enough\">incomplete character</a> of Sunak\u2019s huge spending spike. Johnson may say that the state is standing behind society \u201cthrough thick and thin\u201d but the state is not yet standing behind <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-exposed-extent-uk-social-crisis\">households, behind renters and the self-employed</a>. At the height of the second world war, public expenditure topped 80% of national income. We are nowhere near that figure yet.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s Tories will also take exceptional powers this week, rather as Asquith\u2019s Liberals did in 1914 and Chamberlain\u2019s Tories did in 1939. But those wartime powers were truly draconian from the outset in ways that Matt Hancock\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/08/coronavirus-emergency-law-workers-keep-job-volunteer-for-nhs\">emergency </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/08/coronavirus-emergency-law-workers-keep-job-volunteer-for-nhs\">coronavirus </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/08/coronavirus-emergency-law-workers-keep-job-volunteer-for-nhs\">bill</a> is not \u2013 at least for now. Hancock\u2019s bill is certainly remarkable. It allows police and immigration officials to detain people suspected of carrying the Covid-19 virus, permits ministers to close transport hubs and ports, and gives government the power to ban and close places such as schools that, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-school-colleges-nurseries-england-close-uk-friday\">up to now</a>, have mainly stayed open.</p> <p>But this is as nothing when compared with past wartime powers. The <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/private-lives/yourcountry/overview/homefront/\">Emergency Powers Act of 1939</a>, for example, gave ministers sweeping authority to govern through regulations with no parliamentary sanction whatever. Any act of parliament could be amended or suspended on a minister\u2019s say-so. Food, fuel, pharmaceuticals and clothing were controlled by the state and strictly rationed. Ministers could intern anyone whose detention was thought expedient on grounds of public safety or the defence of the realm. Censorship of the media was effective and was broadly accepted by the media themselves.</p> <p>In both the world wars, moreover, it soon became unsustainable for the single-party government which presided over the outbreak of war to remain in power without forming a national coalition. Asquith brought the Tories and Labour into government in May 1915 and even offered a cabinet post to the Irish Nationalist leader John Redmond. Formal opposition in parliament ceased, and there was a byelection truce. Churchill did much the same in May 1940, when Labour agreed to serve under him.</p> <p>Are such things conceivable as the coronavirus crisis progresses? Certainly they are. But much will have to change on the ground and in government before there is even a chance of them happening. It is hard to imagine the media agreeing to withhold statistics on the progress of the pandemic in the national interest as they did with casualty figures during the world wars. A form of rationing has now begun in the wake of panic buying, but it remains <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/18/asda-puts-restrictions-on-shoppers-to-limit-stockpiling-coronavirus\">devolved to a cartel of supermarkets</a>, and confined to a small number of goods. The over-70s do not yet risk arrest for buying a pint in a pub.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/18/the-covid-19-crisis-is-a-chance-to-do-capitalism-differently\">The Covid-19 crisis is a chance to do capitalism differently | Mariana Mazzucato</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet this is unquestionably a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-exposed-extent-uk-social-crisis\">national crisis</a>. But it is just the start. We are still in the phoney war, it-will-be-all-over-in-weeks phase. In August 1914, most governments assumed the existing armed forces would do all the fighting and that civilians would not be much involved. They were wrong. By the same token, it is possible that Johnson and Dominic Cummings still imagine they will be able to spin their way through the crisis and resume their interrupted election agenda. But they would be wrong too.</p> <p>Politics and the nation are still adjusting to a systemic shock. Johnson is not a unifying figure, though he is trying hard to be one. Nor are many of his ministers or advisers. Who trusts Priti Patel with our liberties? Trust in all politicians is low. The country has been deeply divided by austerity and Brexit. That\u2019s why, just as in 1915 and 1940, it may eventually feel inevitable for Labour and even the SNP to be brought into a governing coalition in some way. This may be a wartime government but, as Asquith and Churchill found out and Johnson may learn, the politics that emerged from the war may be very different from the politics that preceded it.</p> <p>\u2022 Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>Wholesale reform of a \u201creckless\u201d and \u201cdefensive\u201d Home Office is expected to be recommended in a hard-hitting review into the causes of the Windrush scandal when it is released by the home secretary on Thursday.</p> <p>The Windrush Lessons Learned review is expected to criticise Home Office staff and government ministers for their continued failure to admit the magnitude of their mistakes and the scale of damage inflicted on thousands of legal UK residents who were wrongly classified as illegal immigrants, with catastrophic results.</p> <p>Those involved in preparing the long-awaited report, which is understood to run to several hundred pages, were dismayed at the timing of the publication, at a moment when the attention of both politicians and the public is entirely preoccupied with the coronavirus emergency.</p> <p>The report was submitted to the Home Office by its author, Wendy Williams, an inspector of constabulary, on Wednesday, after 20 months of work.</p> <p>The home secretary, Priti Patel, decided to release it very swiftly and is due to make a statement to the House of Commons on the review and its recommendations on Thursday morning.</p> <p>A leaked early version of the report seen by the Guardian indicated that the true scale of the scandal may still remain hidden because many people affected have so little trust in the Home Office that they are scared to come forward.</p> <p>The Guardian has reported on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/10/it-felt-like-intentional-torture-the-windrush-victims-who-are-still-homeless-two-years-on\">numerous cases of people who remain homeless</a>, almost two years after the government first apologised for its mistakes and promised to put things right.</p> <p>The report is likely to focus on the discriminatory effects of \u201chostile environment\u201d immigration policies introduced by Theresa May when she was home secretary, and to condemn Home Office staff for failing to treat those affected with dignity or adequate respect. The Home Office is likely to be criticised for failing in its duty to counter racial discrimination.</p> <p>Williams\u2019s review is expected to highlight the \u201clong-standing tension\u201d between the Home Office\u2019s duty \u201cto protect vulnerable people and communities\u201d and its parallel goal of controlling migration. It may also criticise a \u201cnegative culture\u201d in the Home Office and stress the need for robust whistleblowing policies, and for junior staff to feel able to speak up when they see things going wrong.</p> <p>The report is also expected to argue that Windrush was able to happen because officials had a \u201cpoor understanding\u201d of Britain\u2019s colonial history, the history of migration to the UK and the history of black Britons, and will recommend that the department better reflects the society it represents.</p> <p>The scandal arose after the Home Office wrongly designated thousands of legal UK residents as being in the country illegally. Most had moved to the UK as children in the 1950s and 70s, and found themselves classed as immigration offenders when they reached retirement age.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/14/scale-misery-devastating-inside-story-reporting-windrush-scandal\">Some were mistakenly deported</a> to countries they had left as children about 50 years earlier, and others were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/20/its-inhumane-the-windrush-victims-who-have-lost-jobs-homes-and-loved-ones\">wrongly detained in immigration removal centres</a>. Many lost their jobs after being told they did not have the right to work in the UK and were later denied benefits, leaving them destitute. Many were made homeless, denied NHS treatment and prevented from travelling.</p> <p>The Lessons Learned review was commissioned by Sajid Javid as home secretary weeks after the scandal came to public attention following a series of articles in the Guardian in April 2018. Publication was expected last September, but has been delayed by a prolonged period of checking findings with ministers and officials involved in the scandal, to secure their agreement, in a process known as Maxwellisation.</p> <p>Patrick Vernon, a prominent campaigner for the rights of those affected by the scandal, was invited to Downing Street on Wednesday night to discuss the report with senior officials, but his meeting was cancelled at the last minute. He was concerned that the report\u2019s findings could be buried during the national emergency.</p> <p>His concerns were echoed by those whose lives were shattered by the Home Office. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/19/windrush-generation-tell-of-holidays-that-led-to-exile-and-heartbreak\">Winston Robinson</a>, who arrived from Jamaica aged nine in 1966, was sacked from his job as an ambulance driver in 2016 because he had no passport, and later became homeless.

We\u2019ve learned of this Covid-19 connection with detention centres, and we think it\u2019s time for the government to work on a sensible approach to ensure people\u2019s safety and wellbeing.</p> <p>\u201cI have had a number of people call me very distressed, very worried about potential health concerns, even about basic healthcare, a lack of toilet paper and soap in detention centres.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for the Department of Home Affairs said there were no confirmed cases of Covid-19 among the detained populations at MITA or in the broader detention network. He said ABF was focused on the health and safety of detainees and staff.</p> <p>\u201cIf clinically indicated, detainees will be isolated and tested in line with advice from the Department of Health and the broader commonwealth response,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cA range of measures have been introduced to keep detainees and staff informed of preventive measures and plans have been established to manage any suspected cases of Covid-19.\u201d</p> <p>MITA and other detention centres have implemented \u201cno-contact\u201d visits from last week.</p> <p>Advocates for asylum seekers and refugees say the Apods \u2013 being used as places of held detention \u2013 could be converted to community detention at the direction of the home affairs minister (the immigration minister, David Coleman, is on leave). This would allow asylum seekers and refugees to leave the centres and reduce the security required at them.</p> <p>Some refugees and asylum seekers in detention have family members living in the Australian community with whom they could live. Others have friends and supporters who have expressed a willingness to assist.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/19/australia-coronavirus-live-confirmed-cases-pass-500-as-more-stimulus-planned-latest-updates\">Australia coronavirus live: Peter Dutton says he will 'come after' profiteering hoarders \u2013 latest updates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Globally, the resettlement of refugees has been dramatically curtailed.

But in his latest update he pointed out that Greenland is still waiting for the test results from nine other patients to be analysed in Denmark which controls the island. Meanwhile, all schools in Greenland have been closed in line with Danish policy, he said. </p> \n  <p>Madsen added: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>All flights internally and to and from Greenland will be grounded for 14 days starting at midnight on Friday. The fact that local flights within Greenland will be grounded is rather significant because no two towns in Greenland are connected by road.

We have been told test results will take five to ten days. People have contacted the hospital, but for the most part they are still advising that testing is not necessary unless you have travelled. We do not know if the virus is here. I believe we have one person in self isolation who felt unwell after travelling from the UK, but again that has not officially been confirmed.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The reader said there was also alarm on the Falklands about the limited hospital capacity if coronavirus does hit. They said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A key concern is the ability of the hospital to cope. In total the island\u2019s hospital has 29 beds, seven of which are used for long term care for the elderly already. There are two intensive care beds. Usually if anyone needs critical or specialist care they are flown out to South America or the UK, which is clearly not going to be an option with coronavirus cases. The government raised the possibility that even regular emergency cases might not be accepted by our partners countries if their health systems are already overwhelmed.</p> \n   <p>Many of our medical staff are here on short term contracts, recruited from the UK (or occasionally other countries, we have had several doctors from Canada lately) to work for for 3 to 6 months at a time. Falkland Islanders are concerned what will happen when contracts end and if we will be able to replace those who leave.</p> \n   <p>The other key concern has been tourists coming in. Cruise ship tourists regularly outnumbering the population during the peak season. The season is coming to an end, which should help reduce exposure, but as of today there are still several ships heading here that were reportedly turned away from Punta Arenas.</p> \n   <p>Falkland Islanders are strong, resilient people, but it does feel like the Falkland Island government has been caught unaware by the current outbreak. Updates are few and far between and the current policy to follow the UK\u2019s lead feels problematic given our geographic location and resources.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Update</strong>: Madsen writes:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A second person with Covid-19 in Nuuk has been confirmed. As of 16:00 this afternoon local time the shopping center \u201cNuuk Center\u201d will close, along with will bars, caf\u00e9s, restaurants and gyms. Establishments are allowed to offer take-away food. Grocery stores are allowed to remain open.</p> \n   <p>No one is allowed to leave Nuuk by any mode of transport (snow mobile, boat, plane, etc).

The tone was always going to serious and sombre given the nature of the crisis facing the country. (Every single question was about coronavirus, by my count.) But the effect of holding it in a near-empty chamber also made a difference because there was no cheering or barracking. Boris Johnson had no noise cushion to help him through. It meant that what he said mattered more.</p> \n  <p>Johnson was pressed repeatedly, especially by Jeremy Corbyn, by Ian Blackford and most effectively of all by Chris Byrant, on what he was doing to help workers who will lose out from coronavirus and he was on slightly shaky ground. Ministers insist they will announce a package of employment support measures very soon, and Johnson repeatedly insisted that people should not lose out for doing the right thing (ie, for staying at home, even if they feel well) and he repeatedly said that he was willing to do whatever it took. To some extent, that still sounded more like a slogan than a strategy.</p> \n  <p>But PMQs should also been an opportunity for the prime minister to listen, as well as to communicate, and one would imagine than Johnson would have left the chamber more persuaded than ever about the need for some mass government intervention to protect workers. If Felicity Buchan, a Kensington Tory with a background in banking, is saying that the government does not need to worry about borrowing any more (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/18/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-pmqs-cbi-urges-government-pay-businesses-directly-saying-350bn-loangrant-package-not-enough?page=with:block-5e7213bc8f085e564ad865ee#block-5e7213bc8f085e564ad865ee\">12.29pm</a>), then it is hard to see what is restraining No 10.</p> \n  <p>Johnson has a proper announcement to make during the session. In response to a question from Corbyn, he confirmed that the government would legislate to protect renters from eviction during the coronavirus crisis. He told MPs:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I can indeed confirm that we will be bringing forward legislation to protect private renters from eviction, that is one thing we will do, but it is also important as we legislate that we do not simply pass on the problem, so we\u2019ll also be taking steps to protect other actors in the economy.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Johnson also announced that coronavirus testing was being ramped up to 25,000 tests a day. And, although he did not reveal what the government\u2019s employment support measures would involve, his answers on this were intriguing. He did not dismiss out of hand the temporary universal basis income idea floated by Blackford, or Bryant\u2019s call for a handout in the form of a summer version of the winter fuel payment.</p> \n  <p>Johnson was also interesting on the subject of schools. He told MPs:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The house should expect further decisions to be taken imminently on schools and how to make sure we square the circle both of making sure we stop the spread of the disease but also making sure we relieve, as much as we can, pressure on our NHS.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>That sounded very much like a hint that the government will announce a partial closure of schools, with some provision being kept open - perhaps for children of key workers, or perhaps with schools in childminding rather than education mode? - to minimise the impact on the NHS.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/18/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-pmqs-cbi-urges-government-pay-businesses-directly-saying-350bn-loangrant-package-not-enough\">Keep with more detailed live news from the UK here</a>.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/18/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-pmqs-cbi-urges-government-pay-businesses-directly-saying-350bn-loangrant-package-not-enough\">UK coronavirus live: schools in Scotland and Wales to close from Friday</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7224508f085c6327bc2477\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/ashifa-kassam\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T13:41:47.338Z\">1.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Spanish hotels set to close as British tourists told to return home</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>British tourists in Spain who are looking to return to the UK should make travel arrangements as soon as possible, the British ambassador to Spain has said, as all hotels in the country have been ordered to close down within a week, writes my colleague Ashifa Kassam in Madrid. </p> \n  <p>\u201cOur advice is now that British tourists in Spain who wish to return home should make travel plans to do so as soon as possible,\u201d Hugh Elliott <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HughElliottUK/status/1240044921207304193\">said in a video posted online on Tuesday evening.</a> </p> \n  <p>He continued: \u201cThe government has ordered the closure of hotels over the next seven days in order to reduce risks to health.\u201d As hotels begin shuttering, some tourists will be asked to move hotels, he noted.</p> \n  <p>The embassy is in close contact with Spanish authorities, who have made it clear that \u201cno one will be left without accommodation,\u201d said Elliott.

Just like in the old days with measles. The larger the group that is immune, the less chance that the virus will jump to vulnerable elderly people and people with poor health. With group immunity you build, as it were, a protective wall around them,\u201d said Rutte.</p> \n  <p>The debate by members of the Dutch House of Representatives can be <a href=\"https://nos.nl/livestream/2327490-kijk-mee-kamerdebat-over-ontwikkelingen-coronavirus.html\">viewed live here</a> on the Netherlands public broadcaster, NOS.</p> \n  <p>But while Rutte insisted on Tuesday that the strategy of his country - which has banned public gatherings and taken other measures - differed little from that of other states some Dutch people have been left to wonder if had become \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDutchmen4/status/1239674291798585360?s=20\">the guineapigs of Europe</a>.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The British government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/uk-to-ban-mass-gatherings-in-coronavirus-u-turn\">announced last week</a> that it would be banning mass gatherings after prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s cautious approach to the coronavirus outbreak was overtaken by care homes, sporting bodies and others. That came after the UK government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, had last week defended its initial approach to coronavirus, saying it was aimed at creating a \u201cherd immunity.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Amid a continued debate in the Netherlands, some insisted that the strategy of \u2018herd immunity\u2019 was a side effect rather than the main goal, which was to mirror that of other states in attempting to use social distancing and other measures to \u2018flatten the curve\u2019 of the likely peak of the outbreak.</p> \n  <p>A Dutch microbiologist, Marc Bonten of UMC Utrecht,<a href=\"https://www.telegraaf.nl/nieuws/601067410/virologen-vertrouwen-in-nederlandse-aanpak-maar-nog-veel-onzeker\"> told De Telegraaf newspaper </a>that even countries opting for a total lockdown would have to work on building group immunity.</p> \n  <p>But critics including the London-based economist Jerome Roos pointed to what they estimated the resulting death rate would be, as well as arguing that countries going for \u2018herd immunity\u2019 would <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JeromeRoos/status/1239628249367445506?s=20\">make it impossible for the countries</a> trying to completely stamp out the virus through collective quarantines</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JeromeRoos/status/1239647484105961480\"> \n

The decision stalls years of careful planning to get people to respond to the survey.</p> \n  <p>The Bureau still has plans to send out field workers in May to follow up with people who fail to self-respond, a critical effort that aims to ensure hard-to-count groups get counted. The Bureau said Wednesday it would adjust that operation as necessary to follow the guidance of public health authorities.</p> \n  <p>The decision, made to mitigate the spread of coronavirus, came about a week after Americans began filling out the survey. The results of the census have profound political consequences -- the data is used to allocate $1.5 trillion in federal funding and to draw electoral districts in place for the next decade. The decennial census is mandated by the constitution.</p> \n  <p>Coronavirus concerns add to a pile of challenges facing the bureau. There is considerable concern that minorities and immigrant groups will be fearful of responding to the survey because of the <strong>Trump administration</strong>\u2019s anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies. Individual census responses must be kept confidential by law. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T17:58:48.168Z\">at 5.58pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e725d988f088d7575595e9c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T17:52:12.774Z\">5.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>The Detroit Three -- Ford, GM and Fiat Chrysler -- have agreed to temporarily close all US plants</strong> to protect workers against coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>The Detroit Free Press <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/news/2020/03/18/ford-gm-fca-plant-closures-coronavirus/2865289001/\">reports</a>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> Ford Motor Co. said after Thursday evening shifts, Ford is temporarily suspending production at its North America plants through March 30 to thoroughly clean its facilities to protect its workforce and boost containment efforts for the COVID-19 coronavirus.<br></p> \n   <p>Ford said it will continue to work closely with union leaders to find ways to help keep workers healthy and safe, \u2018even as we look at solutions for continuing to provide the vehicles customers really want and need,\u2019 said Kumar Galhotra, Ford\u2019s president of North America. \u2018In these unprecedented times, we\u2019re exploring unique and creative solutions to support our workforce, customers, dealers, suppliers and communities.\u2019</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Union leaders had pushed for the shutdown for the sake of workers\u2019 health, but the move does make it more likely that auto giants will later seek financial assistance to recover from the coronavirus crisis.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e725b9f8f085e564ad869df\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T17:36:23.279Z\">5.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Dow has now dropped below where it was on the day of <strong>Trump</strong>\u2019s inauguration in 2017.</p> \n  <p>Therefore, all of the stock market gains that Trump has repeatedly boasted about have now been wiped out.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/1240315639853703170\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">*DOW INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE WIPES OUT GAINS SINCE TRUMP INAUGURATION<a href=\"https://t.co/ryuOmteNca\">https://t.co/ryuOmteNca</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/DtiBIaGX4y\">pic.twitter.com/DtiBIaGX4y</a></p>\u2014 Joe Weisenthal (@TheStalwart) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/1240315639853703170?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 18, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7256a28f088d7575595e31\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T17:30:30.895Z\">5.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Trading halted again amid steep losses</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is Joan Greve in Washington, taking over for Adam Gabbatt.</p> \n  <p>Trading was temporarily halted at the New York Stock Exchange, with the Dow currently down more than 1,800 points.</p> \n  <p>This marks the fourth time in two weeks that trading has been halted because of steep losses linked to investors\u2019 fears about the coronavirus crisis.</p> \n  <p>For the latest updates on the market drop, follow the Guardian\u2019s business live blog:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/mar/18/markets-government-stimulus-pledges-ftse-dow-recession-business-live\">Markets slide and pound hits 1985 lows as Covid-19 crisis deepens - business live</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7252558f085c6327bc2705\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T17:10:46.441Z\">5.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>\u2022The government has closed the US-Canada border to \u201cnon-essential traffic\u201d, Donald Trump announced</strong>, as the number of coronavirus cases continued to rise.

Matthew Lee, diplomatic writer at Associated Press, has been looking at how coronavirus became the latest flashpoint between the two nations:</p> \n  <p>Since the virus has spread, he reports, Trump and his top aides have stepped up their criticism of China, noting consistently that the outbreak was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan. They have referred to Covid-19 as the \u201cWuhan virus\u201d or the \u201cChinese virus\u201d on multiple occasions, disregarding World Health Organization terminology that avoids identifying the virus by geography.</p> \n  <p>On Tuesday alone, Trump discussed the Chinese source of virus outbreak during at least two events. At a State Department news conference, Mike Pompeo referred six times to Covid-19 as the \u201cWuhan virus\u201d, and suggested the Chinese are attempting to distract the world from the shortcomings of its initial response.<br></p> \n  <p>In a meeting with hotel executives at the White House, Trump took pains to make clear that the virus originated in China, asking pointed questions of Marriott CEO Arne Sorenson about where the impact was first felt.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAnd this all started in China? That\u2019s where you first saw the problem and where you first got hit?\u201d Trump asked.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Sorenson replied.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cHopefully, you all heard that,\u201d Trump told reporters.</p> \n  <p>Having already been targeted by Trump in a trade war and by Pompeo and others for repression of Muslim and other religious and ethnic minorities in western Xinjiang Province, the Chinese have taken particular offence to the constant repetition, complaining vociferously and suggesting that the US military may have actually introduced the virus to Wuhan.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cRecently, some American politicians have linked the new coronavirus with China to stigmatize China. We express strong indignation and opposition to it,\u201d foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Tuesday. \u201cWe urge the US to immediately correct its mistakes and stop unwarranted accusations against China.\u201d</p> \n  <p>That, in turn, has prompted angry US protests with the State Department hauling in China\u2019s ambassador to the United States to complain and Pompeo calling the top Chinese diplomat to re-register the anger.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe disinformation campaign that they are waging is designed to shift responsibility,\u201d Pompeo said, before quickly adding that \u201cnow is not the time for recriminations.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Yet recriminations seem to be the order of the day.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cChina was putting out information which was false that our military gave this to them,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat was false. And rather than having an argument I said I have to call it where it came from. It did come from China. So I think it\u2019s a very accurate term. But no, I didn\u2019t appreciate the fact that China was saying that our military gave it to them.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>Shortly after Trump\u2019s comments, the Chinese foreign ministry announced the expulsion of American reporters from the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post. </p> \n  <p>Pompeo responded to that news: \u201cI regret China\u2019s decision today to further foreclose the world\u2019s ability to conduct free press operations that frankly, would be really good, really good for the Chinese people in these incredibly challenging global times. Where more information, more transparency are what will save lives. This is unfortunate,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope they will reconsider.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e71fec88f085c6327bc227b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T11:00:39.616Z\">11.00am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Another thing we can expect today is further fall-out from the Chinese decision yesterday to expel American journalists. </p> \n  <p>Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Beijing had been \u201ccompelled\u201d to take countermeasures after Washington imposed restrictions on staff at Chinese state media outlets in the US.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe urge the US to take off its ideological prejudice, abandon cold war mentality,\u201d Geng said. \u201cChina is not one to start trouble, but it will not blink if trouble comes. We urge the US side to immediately stop suppressing Chinese media, otherwise the US side will lose even more.\u201d</p> \n  <p>At least 13 journalists will be expelled in what is an unprecedented retaliation against foreign media working in the country. An announcement made just after midnight said all US journalists working for the New York Times, Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal whose credentials were up for renewal this year would have 10 days to turn in their press cards, a measure that effectively bans them from reporting in the country.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/18/us-media-accuse-china-of-cold-war-mentality-after-move-to-expel-journalists\">China: expulsion of US journalists was response to 'unreasonable oppression'</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e71f4678f085c6327bc2200\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T10:49:11.058Z\">10.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Good morning. Last night <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/17/2020-four-states-primaries-coronavirus-election\">Joe Biden swept to victory in three primaries</a> held in unprecedented circumstances. Biden <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2020/mar/18/democratic-primary-delegate-count-latest\">has now racked up 1,147 pledged delegates to Bernie Sanders\u2019 861</a> - a lead of 286 that surely looks to be insurmountable. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/joe-biden-bernie-sanders-us-elections-2020-panel\">Is it time for Bernie to quit the race</a> in the interest of unifying the party during a national emergency?</p> \n  <p>Ohio cancelled its primary planned for yesterday due to the coronavirus. But with Florida, Illinois and Arizona running their primaries yesterday, predictably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/17/us-elections-voters-coronavirus\">voters faced confusion, a shortage of poll workers, and shifting or closed polling stations</a>. It\u2019s clear that the way the rest of the campaign is going to be deeply affected by the coronavirus outbreak. The DNC is already urging a shift to vote-by-mail.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheDemocrats/status/1240060828243632128\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In order to ensure voters can safely make their voices heard, we at the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DNC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@DNC</a> are urging the remaining primary states to make voting easier and safer for both voters and election officials. The simplest way to ensure this is to make vote by mail available to all registered voters.</p>\u2014 The Democrats (@TheDemocrats) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDemocrats/status/1240060828243632128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 17, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>With bars, shops, and restaurants ordered shut across parts of the nation, it is impossible to see politics being business-as-usual for some time to come.</p> \n  <p>Yesterday Donald Trump was proclaiming that he knew it was a pandemic all along - just weeks after the president promised that the 15 cases of coronavirus in the US would soon go down to zero. There\u2019s currently - as recorded by the <a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering</a> -<strong> 6,496 confirmed coronavirus cases in the US, and the death toll has now exceeded 100. </strong></p> \n  <p>It is understandably dominating today\u2019s White House agenda. Trump has calls and meetings with the aerospace industry, physicians, nurses, and a quarterly business roundtable. The Coronavirus Task Force will be doing a morning briefing.</p> \n  <p>We\u2019ll be tracking the responses to Biden\u2019s win last night and political developments around the country here.
