The death toll, officially at 85, could also be much higher.</p> \n  <p>More than 250,000 Afghans returned home from Iran since the beginning of the year, fanning out across their country without being tested or quarantined. Anecdotal reports have emerged of dozens of returnees dying of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.</p> \n  <p>At a recent briefing, a senior government official said 40 people died of the virus in Sarobi district, barely 50 kilometers (30 miles) east of Kabul. The Health Ministry said it could not confirm the claim, <strong>reports AP</strong>.

Kavanaugh also, like Biden, categorically denied that accusation.

Why do you believe Biden, and not Kavanaugh? Are they not both entitled to the same presumption of innocence, regardless of their political views? </p> \n  <p>Whitmer: \u201cYou know, Jake, as a survivor and as a feminist, I will say this. We need to give people an opportunity to tell their story. But then we have a duty to vet it. And <strong>just because you\u2019re a survivor doesn\u2019t mean that every claim is equal</strong>. It means we give them the ability to make their case, and the other side as well, and then to make a judgment that is informed. </p> \n  <p>\u201cI have read a lot about this current allegation. I know Joe Biden, and I have watched his defense. And there\u2019s not a pattern that goes into this. And I think that, for these reasons, I\u2019m very comfortable that Joe Biden is who he says he is. And you know what? And that\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say about it. </p> \n  <p>\u201cI really resent the fact that, every time a case comes up, all of us survivors have to weigh in. It is reopening wounds \u2026 take us at our word, ask us for our opinion, and let\u2019s move on. </p> \n  <p>Tapper: \u201cWell, just for the record, the reason I\u2019m asking you is because you\u2019re the only Democrat on the show today, not because you\u2019re a survivor, and not because you\u2019re a woman.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Whitmer said she was not criticising Tapper, but \u201cjust sharing, I think, some of the <strong>simmering anger that we survivors have</strong> every time that we have got to confront this from someone else\u2019s behavior that we weren\u2019t a party to, that we weren\u2019t even a part of the reality in the moment. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWhat I think is this. We owe it to every woman who has a story <strong>to listen to that story, and then to vet that story,</strong> ask the questions and be critical thinkers, and then make a judgment, based on all of those pieces. I have done that in this instance. </p> \n  <p>\u201cAnd I will tell you this. I don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s consistent with the Joe Biden that I know.

The manufacturing and construction sector will reopen on Monday before retail businesses come back on 12 May. Zoos, amusement parks and sports stadiums will remain closed until further notice. </p> \n  <p>DeWine said that while he was keenly aware the world is in the middle of a pandemic, <strong>he wanted to balance safety measures with personal freedom</strong>. </p> \n  <p>\u201cI think generally Republicans are less inclined to have the government tell them what to do,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s generally how I am. I\u2019m a conservative Republican.\u201d</p> \n  <p>That philosophy may well have played into DeWine\u2019s decision to reverse an order mandating that customers should wear face masks when shopping.</p> \n  <p>\u201cPeople were not going to accept the government telling them what to do,\u201d said DeWine, who added that retail workers would still need to wear masks. \u201cWe put out dozens and dozens of orders, that was one that it just went too far. But at the same time we pulled that back, I said ... I highly recommend [wearing masks] ... Unless you have a physical reason you can\u2019t wear the mask, and we understand that, but when you go into a retail store, that is the kind thing to do because I worry and we should all worry about the folks who are stocking shelves in grocery stores, the people who are [on] the check-out line who work there all day, and we got to try to protect them.\u201d</p> \n  <p>DeWine also <strong>stopped short of saying he would issue another stay-at-home order if cases started to rise</strong> after the reopening. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to watch numbers every single day,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to communicate those numbers to the people of Ohio.

So if we\u2019re starting to see those numbers, the people of the state are going to see those numbers and we\u2019ll have to take action. But what I hope is as people see those numbers, if they do go up and if they go up dramatically, that the people of the state will react to that.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe keep saying we\u2019re all in this together and that\u2019s the way I look at it as far as my job as governor and the people of the state.

To have to pay for the same service that they are putting their lives at risk for doesn\u2019t seem fair. This charge needs to be scrapped completely for NHS overseas workers.\u201d</p> \n<p>A Home Office spokesperson said the government \u201cfully recognises the contribution international health and care professionals make to the UK\u201d, and described the visa extensions as \u201can exceptional offer to show our gratitude\u201d, but added: \u201cIt is in the public interest for migrants to be financially independent and not burden UK taxpayers.

With many countries <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/france-italy-spain-prepare-to-ease-coronavirus-lockdowns\">beginning to lift lockdown</a>, we\u2019ve arrived at another one of those mirror moments: whether we experience a second wave of coronavirus infections depends in large part on the health status of some of the most vulnerable groups in society.</p> <p>In deciding whether or not to lift lockdown, the first and most important question a government has to answer is whether the rate of new infections is slowing \u2013 and doing so in a sustained way. The critical determinant here is the <a href=\"https://www.healthknowledge.org.uk/public-health-textbook/research-methods/1a-epidemiology/epidemic-theory\">basic reproduction number</a>, R0, which is the average number of people each infected person passes the virus on to in a population where everyone is susceptible. If R0 is above one, the epidemic is growing, and if it\u2019s below one, it\u2019s shrinking.</p> <p>In the UK, the lockdown has brought R0 down significantly \u2013 possibly even to below one. But modellers can\u2019t be sure about that, because the number of new Covid-19 cases is still climbing \u2013 suggesting either that there has been a delay in the reporting of those cases or that the UK epidemic is in fact still growing. \u201cI am not sure of the exact value of R0 at the moment in the UK,\u201d Jasmina Panovska-Griffiths, a modeller at University College London, told me on 27 April.</p> <p>Even if the modellers knew what the UK\u2019s R0 was the number is just an indicator. How well it reflects reality depends on how well you\u2019re sampling your population for the virus and how reliable your tests are. More importantly, perhaps, the R0 is an average. It tells you nothing about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/may/01/uk-coronavirus-live-job-cuts-end-lockdown-politics-covid-19-latest-updates\">variability across a population</a>, and critically, it\u2019s silent about pockets of high disease prevalence in that population. If there are places where Covid-19 is spreading fast then once the lockdown is lifted \u2013 even a little \u2013 it could roar back out of those places, seeding a second wave in a still-susceptible population before a vaccine becomes available.</p> <p>We know <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/28/the-guardian-view-on-covid-19-and-care-homes-promises-are-not-enough\">care homes for</a> older people represent such a pocket, but others could include prisons, where there is no alternative to confinement; and Europe\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/migrant-workers-bear-brunt-of-coronavirus-pandemic-in-gulf\">migrant camps</a>, whose inhabitants in many cases suffer the worst of both worlds \u2013 less than optimal shelter, and restrictions on their movement.</p> <p>If the conditions in which these and other vulnerable groups, such as homeless people, live make it difficult or even impossible for them to avoid infection \u2013 and to get appropriate medical care when sick \u2013 then they will suffer; but so, potentially, will the rest of us.</p> <p>Winston Churchill observed that a society\u2019s attitude to those who commit crimes is the measure of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.charleskochinstitute.org/blog/winston-churchill-prisoners-friend/\">the stored-up strength of a nation</a>\u201d. A pandemic has the potential to turn that message on its head: a society\u2019s attitude to its prisoners \u2013 and homeless people, and asylum seekers \u2013 is a measure of its stored-up weaknesses.</p> <p>A growing number of prisoners<strong> </strong>are older people \u2013 a trend that has tracked the ageing of the general population \u2013 and older people<strong> </strong>are, of course, at heightened risk of contracting Covid-19. But prisons are also often overcrowded, making isolation, quarantine and social distancing difficult to implement.</p> <p>Both inmates and prison personnel are understandably afraid of the prospect of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/21/prisons-could-see-800-deaths-from-coronavirus-without-protective-measures\">infection penetrating their facilities</a> \u2013 especially if the former feel they have been placed in danger through practices such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/31/uk-prisoners-covid-19-symptoms-forced-share-cells\">cohorting</a>, where prisoners with coronavirus-like symptoms (but who haven\u2019t been tested) are made to share cells with others who have tested positive for Covid-19. Several countries have already had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/colombian-prison-riot-over-coronavirus-fears-kills-23\">riots in prisons and escapes</a> during this pandemic.</p> <p>The crowded and unsanitary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/21/fears-catastrophe-greece-migrant-camps-lockdown-coronavirus\">migrant camps in Greece</a>, meanwhile, could be Europe\u2019s achilles heel. Greece has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/how-greece-is-beating-coronavirus-despite-a-decade-of-debt\">controlled </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/how-greece-is-beating-coronavirus-despite-a-decade-of-debt\"> the outbreak</a> efficiently to date, mainly thanks to its government\u2019s quick response. It was already blitzing its population with Covid-19-related public-health messages in January \u2013 before Europe recorded its first case of the disease. It reacted to its own first cases with intensive contact-tracing and testing, and used the time this bought to build hospital and lab-testing capacity.</p> <p>But migrant camps in Greece recorded a spike in cases days before the government planned to ease lockdown restrictions. And though the government has said it intends to integrate the camps into its national Covid-19 strategy, it has yet to be properly implemented there.</p> <p>Globally, the approach to homeless people has varied widely. In the US, California moved quickly to house its homeless population in vacant hotel rooms \u2013 a plan the UK and France have been implementing too \u2013 while in Las Vegas, white rectangles were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/las-vegas-parking-lot-homeless-shelter\">painted on a </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/las-vegas-parking-lot-homeless-shelter\">car park</a>, apparently as a guide to hunkering down in a socially distanced way (the city has since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/16/las-vegas-homeless-coronavirus-parking-lot-center\">erected temporary isolation units</a> in the same car park).</p> <p>Attempts to model the <a href=\"file:///Volumes/Downloads/Internet%20Downloads/COVID19_homeless_modelling%20(1)%20(1).pdf\"> </a>pandemic in England\u2019s homeless population <a href=\"file:///Volumes/Downloads/Internet%20Downloads/COVID19_homeless_modelling%20(1)%20(1).pdf\"> </a>have suggested that, without any intervention, up to three-quarters of them could become infected. Those who fall sick may need medical care, but we don\u2019t yet know what proportion of any population becomes infected without experiencing symptoms. Very approximately, since exact numbers of homeless people are hard to come by, thousands of people sleeping rough in England could be unaware they are infected \u2013 and infectious. That\u2019s not so much a pocket as a seam.</p> <p>As in so many other areas of life, the pandemic is prompting action on social problems where there was inertia before. It would be naive to assume any temporary solutions will be extended beyond the end of this crisis, but they may at least stimulate debate about what should be put in their place. Protecting these vulnerable populations only when doing so protects the rest of us can\u2019t fit many people\u2019s definition of a civilised society.</p> <p>\u2022 Laura Spinney is a science journalist, novelist and author</p> <p><br></p>",

Voice of her (millennial) generation or over-praised pretender? Prose ice queen or deft emotional miniaturist?</p> <p>Perhaps, by now, all Rooney can do is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDZJPJV__bQ\">quote Beyonc\u00e9</a>: \u201cYou know you that bitch when you cause all this conversation.\u201d Now, with this stunning adaptation of <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p089g8rs/normal-people\">Normal People</a></strong>, Rooney (who executive-produced, and worked on the script alongside Alice Birch and Mark O\u2019Rowe) gets to pop another feather in her cap.</p> <p>In 12 half-hour parts, directed by Lenny Abrahamson and Hettie Macdonald, the series (released as a boxset on iPlayer) comprised the slow, bumpy unfolding of the love story, from school to young adulthood, between privileged, intellectual outsider Marianne, with her poisonous homelife (a revelatory Daisy Edgar-Jones from <em>Cold Feet</em>), and jock-with-hinterland Connell (Paul Mescal, making a dazzling TV debut).</p> <p>Early scenes in County Sligo capture the suffocating aspects of small-town life, with Sarah Greene superb as Connell\u2019s mum (who is Marianne\u2019s mother\u2019s cleaner). While Connell at first hides his sexual relationship with Marianne from friends (Marianne\u2019s pitiful acquiescence reeking of deep damage), the tables turn as he struggles and she thrives at Trinity College Dublin.</p> <p>Some elements jarred. Marianne\u2019s supposed transformation from Plain Jane to University Goddess was hampered by Edgar-Jones\u2019s obvious gorgeousness. Marianne\u2019s sexual masochism (hands tied half-heartedly with a scarf) was less than convincing. Elsewhere, elements of Connell\u2019s working-class background felt more boxticked than credible, while Marianne\u2019s absurdly luxuriant Trinity lifestyle made you question how she ended up going to the same school as Connell.</p> <p>Nevertheless, <em>Normal People</em> emerged as a naturalistic masterclass in emotional depth and cerebral elegance. While there were too many overextended sex scenes, they were true to the book, and, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/12/the-stakes-were-really-high-bringing-sally-rooney-normal-people-to-tv\">with an intimacy coordinator on board</a>, both respectful and realistic.</p> <p>Moreover, the leads were heart-stopping. In their hands, you believed in Marianne and Connell\u2019s on-off bond, but also how that gravitational pull wrecked their other (good and bad) relationships. You were convinced by their myriad problems, from the dark (Connell\u2019s refusal to hit Marianne in bed), to the mundane mix-up over him leaving Dublin. Just as with the book, this was a story about barriers (class, social, emotional, intellectual, sexual), and how young love batters itself like a trapped bird against them. It was also about how sometimes people arrive to relationships broken, and then stay broken, and that just has to be OK.</p> <p>The first series of another Irish drama, <strong><a href=\"https://www.channel5.com/show/blood/\">Blood</a></strong>, written by Sophie Petzal, was an engrossing whodunnit about whether a doctor, Jim (Adrian Dunbar), murdered his terminally ill wife. The second series, directed by Maurice Sweeney and Laura Way, and aired over five consecutive nights, opened with a bang, or more specifically a splash, as Jim\u2019s daughter, Fiona (Gr\u00e1inne Keenan) careered out of control in a car into a lake. When her husband (Ian Lloyd Anderson) was discovered dead in the boot of the car, suspicion immediately fell upon her, and others\u2026 including Jim.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ea7c5ce730bada2a707b6292d9b0528165fc55c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ea7c5ce730bada2a707b6292d9b0528165fc55c/0_0_4200_2800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gr\u00e1inne Keenan, Adrian Dunbar and Diarmuid Noyes in Blood\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gr\u00e1inne Keenan, Adrian Dunbar and Diarmuid Noyes in Blood: \u2018bristling with secrets and lies\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: West Road Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As with his role as Ted Hastings in <em>Line of Duty</em>, Dunbar is a genius at ambiguous characters (you root for him, even as you wonder what the shifty-looking sod is up to). Elsewhere, in a stellar cast bristling with secrets and lies, Keenan and Anderson convinced as a couple hopelessly mired in irrevocable toxicity. At times, the show\u2019s constant hurtling between different timezones left one feeling a tad dizzy. Still, once again Petzal proved herself undeniably adept at weaving together a complex knot of murder, family dysfunction, domestic violence, drug-dealing, lesbian love, shattered futures and more.</p> <p>Other <em>Line of Duty</em> alumni, Stephen Graham and Daniel Mays, star in the comedy-drama <strong><a href=\"https://www.sky.com/watch/code-404\">Code 404</a></strong>, written by Daniel Peak, directed by Al Campbell. They play detective partners, one of whom, John Major (Mays) was killed in action, but then resurrected by artificial intelligence. It emerges that not only has DI Roy Carver (Graham) been involved with Major\u2019s wife (Anna Maxwell Martin), but now, if his revitalised partner makes too many mistakes, he can be \u201cswitched off\u201d.</p> <p>As these are the kinds of roles that Mays and Graham excel in playing straight, it took a while to adjust my perceptions. It was delivered as a classic funny/straight double act, with May hurling himself into the comedy and Graham anxiously trying to contain the fallout. While <em>Code 404</em> didn\u2019t always hit the mark in this opener, the energy and enthusiasm were infectious, and with this level of talent on board I will be sticking with it.</p> <p>Oh dear. US showrunner Ryan Murphy has produced some huge series \u2013 <em>Glee</em>, <em>American Crime Story</em>, <em>Pose</em>, <em>The Politician</em>, <em>Feud: Bette and Joan</em>. Sadly, his latest, <strong><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/81088617\">Hollywood</a></strong>, is a bewildering tonal hot mess \u2013 unfunny, but not serious \u2013 despite a hardworking cast including Darren Criss, Queen Latifah, David Corenswet, Patti LuPone, Mira Sorvino, Jim Parsons, Laura Harrier, and Joe Mantello.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a0fa57421c45aeb8a0c66a54357ad5f6f17acd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a0fa57421c45aeb8a0c66a54357ad5f6f17acd4/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laura Harrier as Camille and Queen Latifah as Hattie McDaniel in the ambitious Hollywood\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laura Harrier as Camille and Queen Latifah as Hattie McDaniel in the ambitious Hollywood: \u2018a bewildering, <br> tonal hot mess\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saeed Adyani/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The series strives to be a hyperreal reimagining of postwar Hollywood \u2013 one where \u201cbaddies\u201d (racism, homophobia, sexism) are vanquished. However, it feels glib, particularly when sexual exploitation is played for giggles, albeit mainly happening to male victims. (Maybe to fend off #MeToo criticism? Particularly with Sorvino, one of the first women to publicly accuse Weinstein of sexual harassment, in the cast.) Hollywood looks sublime (think: Netflix <em>La La Land</em>), and it\u2019s not short of vision, with real-life figures such as Rock Hudson, Anna May Wong, and Hattie McDaniel mingling with fictional characters. A shame, then, that the ambitious production ends up dissolving in a huge foaming bath of sentimentality and schmaltz.</p> <p>The opening episode of the new four-part series <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000hqmn\">Museums in Quarantine</a></strong> saw Alistair Sooke looking around <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000hqml\">Tate Modern\u2019s Andy Warhol retrospective</a>, when it had just been closed by the lockdown days after it opened (subsequent episodes \u2013 still on iPlayer \u2013 include <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000hqpj\">Simon Schama on the </a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000hqpj\">Ashmolean\u2019s Young Rembrandt</a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000hqpj\"> exhibition</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000hqq9\">Dr Janina Ramirez at the British Museum</a>). The Warhol show looks fascinating, illustrating how the artist, who died in 1987, wasn\u2019t just about his 1960s pop art and Factory period, but also a multifaceted visionary who sensed the modern world developing, and remains a truly contemporary artist today.</p> <p>Certainly, with his famous quote: \u201cIn the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes,\u201d Warhol has long come across as the godfather of the selfie. However, another story was playing out during this documentary: the stilled escalators, the eerie empty halls\u2026 this wasn\u2019t about just one museum exhibition, this was about a country in quarantine, and the cultural world we\u2019re still hungry to see.</p>",

Since then, more than 3,000 have emigrated to the UK, the majority settling in Crawley, West Sussex.</p> <p>The \u00a340m fund, which was to be spent over 10 years, was launched in November 2016, when the British government announced it had extended the lease for the US to continue hosting its military base on Diego Garcia. While the base is in operation the UK government has forbidden the exiled islanders from resettling, despite their long campaign for their right to return.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Unfortunately there is no mechanism in place to implement a plan for the Chagossian community</p> <footer> <cite>UK Foreign Office</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The fund, branded hush money by critics, was created as part of a \u201cChagossian Development Plan\u201d created by the Foreign Office and US State Department during a meeting in June 2016, in the run-up to the lease extension, a document obtained by a Freedom of Information request shows.</p> <p>About \u00a3580,000 of the fund has been spent so far.

As you might expect, it is rich in tragicomedy, with former <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4bORXW9xeU\">club director Charlie Methven</a> repeatedly channeling David Brent.

This popular pick from 2014 finds the team still tormented by that humiliating defeat. Enter Thomas Rongen, an eccentric, magnetic coach who brings the team together through force of will. For a film about losing, this is heartwarming, life-affirming stuff, not least the story of defender Jaiyah Saelua, the first transgender player in a World Cup qualifier.

  "<p>The history of British fascism is a history of failure. In a new book, <em>Failed F\u00fchrers</em>, the historian <a href=\"https://crestresearch.ac.uk/people/graham-macklin/\">Graham Macklin</a> retells that story through biographies of six fascist leaders, from Arnold Leese and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/oswald-mosley\">Oswald Mosley</a> in the interwar years, through AK Chesterton, Colin Jordan and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/jul/20/guardianobituaries.thefarright\">John Tyndall</a>, in the postwar years, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nick-griffin\">Nick Griffin</a>, whose British National party polled half a million votes in the 2010 election \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/14/general-election-2010-fall-bnp\">immediately imploded</a>. Enoch Powell once mused that all political lives \u201cend in failure\u201d. Macklin observes acidly that the political lives of British fascists \u201cdid not simply end in \u2018failure\u2019 but began there too\u201d.</p> <p>British fascism is a story as much of continuity as of change \u2013 an ever-present obsession with racial purity, venomous antisemitism and the undertow of violence. It is also, for all the political irrelevance of British fascists, a story whose lessons are worth pondering.</p> <p>The terms \u201cfascist\u201d or \u201cfar right\u201d are liberally dispensed these days, applied to Ukip, the Brexit party, even Boris Johnson\u2019s administration. What <em>Failed F\u00fchrers</em> makes clear is that however reactionary such parties and politicians may be, theirs is a politics far removed from the true toxicity of fascism. We would be foolish to ignore the difference and diminish the meaning of fascism.</p> <p>One reason for the marginalisation of British fascists is their sheer incompetence, combined with a degree of internecine conflict that makes the fractiousness of the left seem like a bout of tree hugging. Then there\u2019s the unresolved tension between old-style Nazism and modern <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/identity-politics\">identity politics</a>, a tension that European groups have more adroitly negotiated.</p> <p>In the 1960s, the French Nouvelle Droite, led by philosopher <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/lesterfeder/the-man-who-gave-white-nationalism-a-new-life\">Alain de Benoist</a>, pioneered a reworking of traditional fascist themes, pivoting from claims of racial superiority to arguments about cultural difference. The mixing of cultures through immigration, de Benoist argued, damaged the identity of the host nation. Hence the need to halt immigration, especially of Muslims.</p> <p>These ideas were taken up assiduously by far-right groups in Europe and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/27/american-alt-right-playbook-bolsonaro-extremist-tactics-brazil\">alt-right</a> in America and underpin \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/24/generation-identity-uk-far-right-extremists\">Generation Identity</a>\u201d movements. In Britain, BNP leader Griffin replaced the Nazi magazine <em>Spearhead</em> with a publication called <em>Identity</em> to reflect the party\u2019s new \u201cmodern nationalism\u201d. The BNP, Griffin insisted, simply wanted Britain \u201cto be left with our own culture and identity intact\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One reason for the marginalisation of British fascists is their sheer incompetence</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet the new politics of identity never displaced old-fashioned, biologically based racism and antisemitism. Griffin remained a Holocaust denier and when faced with the rise of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/may/28/english-defence-league-guardian-investigation\">English Defence League</a>, he tellingly dismissed them as \u201cZionist puppets\u201d.</p> <p>Equally importantly, mainstream British parties, the Conservatives in particular, have been better able to meet the challenge of the far right than have their continental equivalents. In the wake of Powell\u2019s \u201cRivers of Blood\u201d speech in 1968, National Front leader Tyndall declared that \u201cworkers will never go Tory despite their respect for Powell\u201d. Instead, \u201cold-guard politics\u201d would be weakened, creating an opening for the NF.</p> <p>A decade later, the Tories helped destroy Tyndall\u2019s party. In 1978, Margaret Thatcher openly courted NF voters, talking tough on immigration and worrying that \u201cpeople are really rather afraid that this country might be rather swamped by people with a different culture\u201d. She swept to power the following year; the NF faded back into the shadows.</p> <p>Forty years later, when Labour\u2019s \u201cred wall\u201d came tumbling down in the 2019 general election, the wrecking ball was driven not by the far right, as may have happened in Europe, but by Boris Johnson, with a mixture of bonhomie, Brexiteering and promises of \u201clevelling up\u201d. \u201cOld-guard politics\u201d has eroded, but not in the way that Tyndall imagined.</p> <p>British conservatives have, for historical reasons, had greater freedom to be pragmatic than their counterparts in Europe. They have been helped in this by the importance to British identity of the Second World War and of the fight against Nazism. Nationalism has become entrenched, but not the far right.</p> <p>At the same time, the existence of a marginalised fascist milieu provides, in Macklin\u2019s words, \u201ca convenient \u2018other\u2019\u201d to assure Britons that \u201cfascism\u2019s racist panaceas are somehow \u2018alien\u2019 and far removed from their own \u2018liberal\u2019 stance on race and immigration\u201d.</p> <p>Not being Mosley or Griffin gives mainstream politicians, paradoxically, the space to pursue illiberal policies. It\u2019s striking how many concerns originating in the far right, from the idea that British people had not been given their say on immigration to notions of \u201cwhite identity\u201d, now nestle in the mainstream. Ironically, it\u2019s in their failure that British fascists may most have shaped politics.</p> <p>\u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist</p>",

But it is also notable that in 2016 in Amash\u2019s home state, Michigan, Trump took a key electoral college win over Hillary Clinton by 10,704 votes, or less than a quarter of a percentage point. Gary Johnson, the Libertarian, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/michigan\">won 172,136 votes \u2013 or 3.6%</a>.

The parlour game of the week for Washington pundits, therefore, involved trying to weigh whether Amash\u2019s candidacy would hurt Biden or Trump more.</p> <p>He also follows in a <a href=\"http://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/notes-on-the-state-of-politics/\">long tradition of third-party campaigns</a> that have struggled to break through in a society that prizes choice but has been slow to embrace the type of multiparty democracies seen in Europe.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Democratic party is much more scapegoating toward the small left parties than Republicans are to the Libertarians</p> <footer> <cite>Ralph Nader</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The only third-party candidate to gain more than a quarter of the vote was a man who had already occupied the White House. Having been denied the Republican nomination in 1912, former president <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/the-roosevelts\">Theodore Roosevelt</a> ran as a Progressive or \u201cBull Moose\u201d party candidate and won 27%, not enough to deny Woodrow Wilson the presidency.</p> <p>Robert La Follette, Strom Thurmond, George Wallace, Eugene McCarthy and Ron Paul are among those who tried and failed to break the duopoly. In 1992, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/09/ross-perot-obituary\">Ross Perot,</a> an eccentric Texan billionaire, took 19% of the vote, arguably denying George HW Bush a second term and putting Bill Clinton in the Oval Office. Perot ran again in 1996 but only garnered 8%.</p> <p>In 2000, Nader\u2019s Green Party bid took less than 3% of the vote but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/nov/10/uselections2000.usa8\">was widely blamed</a> for having cost Democrat Al Gore vital support and contributed to George W Bush\u2019s narrow win, a fork in the road that had dizzying implications for the Iraq war, climate crisis and the entire shape of the 21st century.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BobShrum?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Bob Shrum,</a> a senior adviser for the Gore campaign, said this week: \u201cI haven\u2019t forgiven him. I think whatever good he did in the early part of his life is more than made up, for example, by the Iraq war. He hurt because he attacked Gore from the left: that was his argument. I don\u2019t know that Amash is in the same position. The assumption that he would take votes from Biden rather than Trump seems dubious to me at best.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e889c978b17f707360e25d115c37c2cd5c36c04f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e889c978b17f707360e25d115c37c2cd5c36c04f/0_182_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ralph Nader speaks at Boston University in November 2000.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ralph Nader speaks at Boston University in November 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amy E Conn/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now 86, Nader is a consumer advocate who still follows politics closely, firing off <a href=\"https://nader.org/2020/04/27/the-uplifting-magic-of-mothers-day-in-these-perilous-days/\">columns and newsletters</a>. He denies that his candidacy handed the presidency to Bush.</p> <p>\u201cThere are all kinds of other reasons that the Democrats lost,\u201d he said. \u201cGore doesn\u2019t blame the Green Party at all. He said: \u2018It\u2019s us. We did it. I lost my home state of Tennessee. We bungled it in Florida.\u2019 On and on.</p> <p>\u201cAnd then George Bush wasn\u2019t elected, he was selected by five out of nine supreme court justices in a judicial coup d\u2019etat [following a dispute over the count in Florida]. The only way the Democratic party can explain its constant loss to the worst Republican party in history is to scapegoat the Greens. It\u2019s built into their DNA.\u201d</p> <p>Nader ran in 2004 and 2008 but polled less than 1% both times. Campaigning could be a frustrating experience, he recalls.</p> <p>\u201cAlmost all the interviews had nothing to do with <a href=\"http://www.votenader.org/\">my agenda, which was a precursor</a> to Bernie Sanders\u2019 agenda \u2013 universal healthcare, free tuition, living wage, cracking down on corporate crime. All they wanted to ask about was \u2018spoiler\u2019 and that\u2019s partly because the Democratic party is much more scapegoating toward the small left parties than the Republican party is to the Libertarian party.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know whether that will happen this year, but by far the Democrats are much more aggressive to get third-party candidates like the Green Party off the ballot, harassing them, calling them spoilers and setting the media\u2019s agenda for spoilers.</p> <p>\u201cEven the European media would call me up and say: \u2018Do you think you\u2019re helping George W Bush? Are you a spoiler?\u2019 And I\u2019d say: \u2018Spoiler? I\u2019m trying to fight a spoiled political system.\u2019 A multi-party system creates more meaning for voters because it gives them more voices and choices.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018We need more parties\u2019</h2> <p>Nader welcomes the entry of Amash and others as an expression of first amendment freedoms but is uncertain about the likely political consequences.</p> <p>\u201cIf he plays his cards right and he basically is viewed as the lawmaker who stood up to the foul mouth, snarling, lying, bungling betrayer of his own voters, then he will take more from Trump,\u201d he said of Amash. \u201cBut if he tries to appeal to all voters, then it\u2019s another equation and nobody knows what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson, a former governor of New Mexico, came third in 2012 and did so again in 2016.

That is the grim message from doctors and psychologists who last week warned that even after lockdown measures had been lifted thousands of individuals would still be suffering.</p> \n  <p>Some of these problems will be due directly to the impact that the virus has had on those it has infected, especially those who went through life-saving interventions in intensive care units (ICUs) in hospital. In addition there will be a considerable impact on vulnerable people affected by the lockdown and isolation.</p> \n  <p>As a result, there is a danger our society could become more anxious and risk-averse, say scientists who have called for a range of research programmes to be launched to understand the issues and to allow society to prepare itself for the physiological and psychological problems that lie ahead.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThis has been a national trauma like no other that we have experienced,\u201d said psychologist Professor Dame Til Wykes, of King\u2019s College London. \u201cConsider the terrible flooding we had earlier this year. People watched river levels rise and listened to weather forecasts to find out if they might be inundated the next day or the day after. That was stressful.</p> \n  <p>\u201cBut it was nothing compared to this threat which has hung over us for weeks already and is likely to go on for much longer. Spending months looking over your shoulder all the time is going to cause considerable, lasting anxiety for many people. In addition, if you look at other natural disasters, you can usually find help or comfort from people around you. However, it is the people around you that are the threat in this case.

But the agency has had a low profile during this pandemic, with White House officials controlling communications and leading most press briefings.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThis report seems to challenge the idea that the China travel ban in late January was instrumental in changing the trajectory of this pandemic in the United States,\u201d said Jason Schwartz, assistant professor of health policy at the Yale School of Public Health.</p> \n  <p>President Donald Trump has repeatedly celebrated a federal decision, announced on 31 January, to stop entry into the US of any foreign nationals who had traveled to China in the previous 14 days. That took effect on 2 February. </p> \n  <p>China had imposed its own travel restrictions earlier, and travel out of its outbreak areas did indeed drop dramatically.</p> \n  <p>But in her article, Schuchat noted that nearly 2 million travellers arrived in the US from Italy and other European countries during February. The US government didn\u2019t block travel from there until 11 March.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe extensive travel from Europe, once Europe was having outbreaks, really accelerated our importations and the rapid spread,\u201d she told the AP. \u201cI think the timing of our travel alerts should have been earlier.\u201d</p> \n  <p>She also noted in the article that more than 100 people who had been on nine separate Nile River cruises during February and early March had come to the U.S. and tested positive for the virus, nearly doubling the number of known U.S. cases at that time.</p> \n  <p>Schuchat also noted the explosive effect of some late February mass gatherings, including a scientific meeting in Boston, the Mardis Gras celebration in New Orleans and a funeral in Albany, Georgia. The gatherings spawned many cases, and led to decisions in mid-March to restrict crowds.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI think in retrospect, taking action earlier could have delayed further amplification (of the US outbreak), or delayed the speed of it.\u201d<br><br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eacbb578f082b32fdd6bd4e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T00:17:42.217Z\">1.17am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Yesterday, Beijing correspondent Lily Kuo published this piece on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/chinas-dining-table-revolution-takes-aim-at-shared-chopsticks\">\u201cdining table revolution\u201d in China</a>, seeking to end, or at least change, the tradition of all-in communal meals, and reduce physical contact and shared utensils.</p> \n  <p>Today Zoe Williams looks at how European cuisine may also struggle to adjust. </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/02/will-coronavirus-spell-an-end-to-the-great-chinese-buffet\">Will coronavirus spell an end to the great Chinese buffet?</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eacb8298f087d47c7787d99\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/lois-beckett\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T00:01:07.432Z\">1.01am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, promised \u201cmeaningful\u201d adjustments to stay-at-home orders in the coming days as protesters gathered in the capital of Sacramento and in Orange county\u2019s Huntington Beach, a recent flashpoint after Newsom ordered beaches there to close following a busy weekend.</p> \n  <p>In Sacramento, the state\u2019s capital, a packed crowd of protesters faced off with lines of riot cops in a tense and chaotic protest on Friday afternoon.</p> \n  <p>\u201cTraitors!\u201d the protesters screamed at police, according to a livestream of the protest produced by reporters from the Sacramento Bee.</p> \n  <p>Some protesters held signs questioning whether the coronavirus is real or promoting anti-vaccine conspiracies, while others protested the closure of businesses during the pandemic, arguing that all jobs are essential.
