Mosques and holy sites would be kept closed at least until 4 May, but he urged Iranians to pray at home. The holy month of Ramadan starts on 23 April.</p> \n  <p>Tehran was gridlocked with traffic on Saturday when office employees were asked to return to work. Public transport, seen as a major transmitter of the virus, is unable to cope with the passenger traffic, making government commitments to implement smart distancing largely ineffectual. Traffic into Tehran was up 70% from traffic on the same day last year, Tehran police chief Mohammad Reza Mehmandar said.</p> \n  <p>Rouhani acknowledged the dilemma, but said the solution was for councils to purchase more buses, or bring back into use those that had broken down. Crowds also gathered outside banks on Saturday to purchase a SIM card required to access a government grant of 1m Iranian toman ($23). Pictures of the crowds were emblazoned on Iranian newspapers with reporters questioning government policy. As many as 600,000 made unemployed due to the lockdown had registered for the government grant, but living standards of the middle class are also sliding. </p> \n  <p>Health ministry figures on Saturday showed the number of new deaths had fallen to a record low of 73. The number of new infections was 1,374, part of a steady downward trend. But Tehran\u2019s mayor pointed to an Iranian parliament report saying the official figures undercounted the number of deaths caused by the virus due to the lack of effective testing in hospitals. Opposition sources produce figures for deaths that are as high as 30,000, more than six times the official figures.

  "<p>In a world where artists can be judged as much by their celebrity as by their work, Jeffery Camp, who has died aged 96, was reliably unconventional in both aspects. While highly regarded by his peers, Camp seemed undesirous of becoming a household name, and approached life entirely as an artist and a teacher of art.</p> <p>It was the English coastal landscape, from his childhood home of Lowestoft, Suffolk, to East Sussex in the 1960s through to the 80s, that provided the most fertile source of subject matter for Camp, and the latter was where he produced his best work. His wife during that time, the artist Laetitia Yhap, was also an important presence, both as inspiration and influence.</p> <p>After the couple moved to Hastings, Camp discovered nearby Beachy Head, and, attracted by its resilience, painted it repeatedly. When asked why, in 2010, Camp said: \u201cIt is a spectacular open space, dramatic and high for a person born in flat lands.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66a2c1f0e58259fa59febff0bfecfc2fa84f77c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66a2c1f0e58259fa59febff0bfecfc2fa84f77c5/26_0_1929_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beachy Head, Spectacular Drop, 1972.

Jeffery Camp has depicted himself hidden in his wife\u2019s shadow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Art Space Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Beachy Head, Spectacular Drop (1972), the couple are depicted on a circular canvas between a vertiginous rock and a hard place far below. Yhap looks askance toward the sea, half-smiling in the light; Camp is hidden in her shadow, figuratively and metaphorically, his fist held against his mouth. The abstract border in which the two of them nestle also contains them in segmented, horizontal gradations of inspiring blues, left, and contrasting, depressive blue-blacks, on the right.</p> <p>Sprung Figure (1981), shows Yhap naked and bent over backwards, set against deep waters, one eye directed laser-like towards Camp\u2019s outsized head. To the viewer, the situation in which the artist has placed his model is an impossible one, yet the inspiration for it was, Camp said, merely an Etruscan door handle.</p> <p>Camp liked to use unusually shaped canvases as part of the composition of his paintings, saying: \u201cMy pictures are asymmetrical. The odd shapes more easily contain a variety of thoughts.\u201d The small but brilliant Laetitia and a Cornish Tin Mine (1967), with its vivid colour and stylised composition, says much about Camp\u2019s ability to innovate, and more vibrantly than do his later works, which are defined by a failure of development. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3bf2e53f8369b20b09e4d4b62b08bc79f1dedae5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3bf2e53f8369b20b09e4d4b62b08bc79f1dedae5/142_184_6311_2209/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sprung Figure at Beachy Head, 1981, by Jeffery Camp\" width=\"1000\" height=\"350\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sprung Figure at Beachy Head, 1981, by Jeffery Camp.

He had an economy with paint that was pushed and shoved sparingly, dry from the tube, leaving areas of raw canvas that form an important part of the painted surface.</p> <p>The art historian and curator Sir Norman Rosenthal, a supporter of Camp and his work after meeting him through \u201cthe louche circle of Derek Jarman\u201d called him a \u201cRoger Fry-ish visionary\u201d (after the English painter and member of the Bloomsbury group). The artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/nov/19/john-craxton-obituary\">John Craxton</a> described his contemporary as a \u201crare poetic painter of delight whose radiant visions never cease to amaze and give pleasure\u201d.</p> <p>A lecturer at the Slade School of Art from 1963 to 1988, Camp also wrote the instructional books Draw (1981) and Paint (1996). In Draw, Camp observed: \u201cDrawing can open the door and raise that useful extra eyelid which, like that possessed by certain lizards, is in humans the inhibiting, cribbed, confining, narrow-browed, vertical thinking curtain eyelid of conformity.\u201d Among his students at the Slade was the writer AA Gill. In a foreword to Camp\u2019s last exhibition in 2016 at the <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/artanddesign/art\">Art</a> Space Gallery in Islington, north London, Gill contrasted his \u201clugubrious\u201d manner with his inspiring teaching: \u201cIn a counter zeitgeist way \u2026 he would look at your work and say \u2018Have you ever thought how Matisse might do that?\u2019 Or \u2018Copy that Raphael.

He attended Lowestoft and Ipswich schools of art between 1939 and 1940, then Edinburgh College of Art (1941-44) under Sir William Gillies, whose work Camp enduringly admired. On graduation he received an Andrew Grant travelling scholarship, and other bursaries and awards. In 1955 he painted the altarpiece for <a href=\"http://www.heritage.norfolk.gov.uk/record-details?MNF54706-St-Alban%27s-Church-Grove-Walk-Lakenham&amp;Index=47353&amp;RecordCount=57339&amp;SessionID=7db7fcd4-4f2a-4b3f-9b02-32e46bf2d7d8\">St Albans Church, Norwich.</a></p> <p>His first solo show was at Beaux Arts Gallery, London, from 1959, and he began teaching at Chelsea School of Art the following year, before joining the Slade in 1963. He married Yhap the same year, and they moved to Hastings in 1967.</p> <p>Subsequent solo shows were held at New Art Centre, London (1968), the South London Gallery (1973) and the Serpentine Gallery (1978).</p> <p>After he and Yhap separated, Camp moved to Stockwell, south London, in 1982. He was made a Royal Academician in 1984, and had a solo show at the Royal Academy in 1988.

Similarly, he \u201cwatched everything on television\u201d and this was the one item of furniture that never moved in his typically frayed artist\u2019s living room in Stockwell. The whole house was covered in his paintings, all thrown at the walls with banged-in nails. His largest paintings, done in panels such as the 17ft-tall Fling, were also painted upstairs on the party wall divide.</p> <p>According to Michael Richardson, the director of Art Space, and his dealer and friend for more than a decade, Camp was hard to pin down and would not venture more than \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d if asked for any comment about his work. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kVHzcNop_Y\">Richardson also made films of Camp painting</a>.

  "<p>Many of the foreign doctors, nurses and care workers on the NHS frontline <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/nhs-staff-protection-doctor-ppe-coronavirus\">without adequate protection</a> are secretly struggling on another front, too. They cannot afford to pay the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/28/scrap-625-pound-surcharge-for-nhs-ovserseas-staff\">fees levied by the Home Office</a> to enable them to remain in the UK and continue their work. </p> <p>Often they fall into debt to pay the charges. Some of them simply leave the country once their permits are up for renewal, unable to find the money. The highest single fee they face is the immigration health surcharge, which must be paid in advance. So you have the spectacle of NHS staff <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/20/calls-scrap-plans-nhs-fee-foreign-staff-health-surcharge\">paying to use the NHS</a>, even though they already pay tax and national insurance contributions.</p> <p>British citizens unfamiliar with the Home Office\u2019s fee framework struggle to understand this when they hear of it for the first time. They\u2019re unable to grasp that there are NHS staff who are taxed twice to use the NHS. Surely I must mean people on visitor visas who don\u2019t work in the UK, they say? Surely the NHS surcharge is directed at them, to disincentivise health tourism?</p> <p>No. I do not mean <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/feb/07/health-tourism-claims-distraction-from-nhs-real-problems\">\u201chealth tourists\u201d</a>. I mean NHS doctors, nurses and care workers from outside the EU who spend the years between visa renewals fretting, saving and borrowing to pay for the cost of their next permit. The sums are crippling, particularly for junior doctors in training and nurses whose salaries start at about \u00a323,000 and \u00a318,000 a year respectively. The NHS surcharge at the moment is <a href=\"https://www.freemovement.org.uk/what-is-the-immigration-health-surcharge/\">\u00a3400 a year</a>. There is no right of deferral, or ability to pay annually. It has to be paid in advance for the entire duration of an applicant\u2019s visa or residency permit.</p> <p>If an NHS worker has any family included on the residency permit, such as a spouse and children, the applicant has to pay the surcharge for them as well, again for the entire duration of the visa. So a family of four on a five-year work permit or limited leave to remain visa has to pay \u00a38000. The fee is to go up this October, <a href=\"https://www.freemovement.org.uk/immigration-health-surcharge-rising-to-624-in-october-2020/\">from \u00a3400 to \u00a3624</a>. That same family of four will then have to pay \u00a312,480. I don\u2019t know if there are many people in the UK, let alone junior doctors, nurses and care workers, who have that kind of money lying around.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-announces-health-surcharge\">surcharge was introduced</a>, like many of the more cynical and punitive features of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/27/hostile-environment-anatomy-of-a-policy-disaster\">hostile environment</a>, by the coalition government in 2015. The sums are set arbitrarily and rise randomly, and we are assured the yield is ploughed back into the NHS, although it\u2019s hard to find evidence of what it is actually used for. The policy was intended to crack down on medical tourism to make sure the \u201cimmigration system is fairer to British citizens and legitimate migrants\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/nhs-staff-to-be-asked-to-treat-coronavirus-patients-without-gowns\">NHS staff to be asked to treat coronavirus patients without gowns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The jargon masks the true nature of the victims of the legislation, while giving the impression that the measures target scheming <a href=\"https://keepournhspublic.com/health-tourism-fact-vs-fiction/\">illegal health tourists</a> who come to the UK to use the NHS and then disappear, costing the taxpayer millions. The surcharge is a fair one, the government claims, to be paid by all those who are \u201cnot ordinarily resident\u201d, a clever technicality that conjures up images of unemployed visitors, but in fact means the opposite. Tourists do not pay the charge, only overseas citizens<strong> </strong>working and studying in the UK do. </p> <p>\u201cNot ordinarily resident\u201d simply means \u201cwithout permanent residency\u201d. Those who fall into that category include a large number on work visas, low incomes and limited leave to remain, paying taxes, VAT and national insurance. Some, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/12/malaysia-gp-home-office-pushing-away-foreign-nhs-doctors\">Dr Siti Ibrahim</a>, a Yorkshire GP in training, have been educated in the UK and have spent decades living and working in the country. Faced with permit renewal costs of \u00a311,400, Ibrahim has been forced to consider abandoning her career. \u201cMy heart is here in the NHS,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut I can only take so much.\u201d</p> <p>The unfairness of the NHS surcharge is even more pronounced against the backdrop of a pandemic during which foreign NHS staff are working extra shifts without pay, grateful for free coffee and food donations. With no exceptions, those I have heard from over the past few days, and who have been instructed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/31/nhs-staff-gagged-over-coronavirus-protective-equipment-shortages\">not to speak publicly</a> to the media about work conditions or PPE, were happy to work those extra shifts.</p> <p>With no exceptions, they all said they did not know where they were going to find the money to pay for their visa renewals when the NHS surcharge rises once again in October, when it will also be expanded to those from the EU. They cannot put their names to this anxiety, but they can be heard. There are <a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-7783/\">153,000 non-British workers in the NHS</a>. The government needs to abolish the NHS surcharge for all of them, with immediate effect.</p> <p>\u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>Glimpsed through half-open doors, the panelled rooms of Frank Hollmeyer\u2019s Georgian terraced house remind you of a Dutch old master painting. Light slants across wooden floors; paintings and porcelain are arranged as if in a painting by Vermeer. For Hollmeyer, an art historian by training, those 17th-century artists excelled \u201cat intimate scenes of everyday domesticity, where everything feels composed\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s an approach he\u2019s applied here. The five-storey house, set on a shady garden square in south London, is Hollmeyer\u2019s \u201ccanvas\u201d. It\u2019s where he takes a quiet pleasure in re-ordering books or piling a blue and white Delft bowl with fruit, like an artist tweaking a composition.</p> <p>As the name of his Instagram account, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/slightly_worn/?hl=en\" title=\"\">slightly_worn,</a> suggests, it\u2019s also a home that feels relaxed and unpretentious. There are deep sofas and burning grates upstairs for socialising and a large, eat-in kitchen in the basement for cosy suppers. Nothing is too \u201cpristine or polished\u201d in the house, which he discovered by chance in 2012. \u201cI\u2019d been looking for a bigger place with space to hang my paintings. My last home was in north London and I didn\u2019t know this part of London at all. But I\u2019d had supper with friends nearby and decided to explore,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6368d55395be196b4482868d3ffda3a12ee9c47b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6368d55395be196b4482868d3ffda3a12ee9c47b/0_959_7718_4628/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The basement kitchen for cosy suppers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Relaxed and unpretentious\u2019: the basement kitchen for cosy suppers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachael Smith</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As he passed the house in Kennington, noting the fanlight and arched windows, a young man opened the front door, attached a \u201cFor Sale\u201d sign to the railings and disappeared inside. When Hollmeyer rang up to inquire, he discovered that it was a private sale. \u201cThe family had lived there for almost 30 years. One son wanted to be an estate agent, so his father had told him to have a go at selling this house.\u201d A gentlemanly deal was struck. Three weeks later, he moved in.</p> <p>Growing up in the Netherlands in the 1980s, Hollmeyer remembers how the old masters were omnipresent. Girls with pearl earrings peered out from wine coasters and \u201cnearly every living room had a Rembrandt poster\u201d. When he was a teenager the family moved to Amsterdam, where he became fascinated by its neo-classical architecture. \u201cWilliam and Mary brought that style to England. So you could argue that Georgian architecture owes a debt to them.\u201d</p> <p>This stucco and brick-fronted house has that mix of \u201cclassicism and austerity\u201d that he has always found so appealing. But over the centuries, original 1790s details had been masked by overzealous refurbishments. During his research, Hollmeyer, who is half Dutch and half German, discovered the square was built for workers at the nearby Bethlem Royal Hospital asylum (now the Imperial War Museum).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"318eb912bacf0495dea68960361d1ec7f5968376\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/318eb912bacf0495dea68960361d1ec7f5968376/0_2283_6226_3735/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A ship\u2019s timber and trompe l\u2019oeil in the bedroom.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wood find: a ship\u2019s timber and trompe l\u2019oeil in the bedroom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachael Smith</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBy the 19th century this was a slum, marked in black on the map. In the 1930s, the council bought most of the square by compulsory order. This house was one of a pair laterally converted into flats.\u201d Georgian features \u2013 shutter boxes, skirtings, architraves \u2013 were ripped out. When Hollmeyer arrived, there were pine fireplaces, textured wallpaper and carpet-smothered stairs.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve restored the house in stages as everything is so expensive,\u201d he says. \u201cAt one point I ran out of money, so I stopped.\u201d When he discovered a slice of original cornice, the builders were able to create a mould and recast it. The dado rail was reinstated and floorboards sanded and washed a light grey. For authenticity, Hollmeyer turned to historic buildings expert Tim Whittaker of the <a href=\"https://www.thespitalfieldstrust.com/\" title=\"\">Spitalfields </a><a href=\"https://www.thespitalfieldstrust.com/\" title=\"\">Trust</a>. \u201cHe visited and drew up designs for the shutter boxes and architraves.\u201d On the first floor, the library at the back has new panelling and a deep cornice. It too \u201cfeels very Dutch\u201d.</p> <p>There were other discoveries. While the builders set to work to redecorate the top-floor bedroom, they uncovered the weighty beam that runs from front to back. For decades, it had been completely obscured by a false ceiling. \u201cI found out that it\u2019s a ship\u2019s timber from Chatham dockyard. Good wood was very expensive in those days. So when ships were decommissioned the timber was sold to housebuilders.\u201d He points out the grooves along its length. \u201cIt\u2019s likely that they were cut to support decking.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e1ebe5e2eadb25f1560ab33ef36c416c7c82d21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e1ebe5e2eadb25f1560ab33ef36c416c7c82d21/0_3456_6617_3967/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Deep sofas and burning grates in the restful sitting room.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Deep sofas and burning grates\u2019: the restful sitting room.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachael Smith</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Apart from the neoclassical trompe l\u2019oeil wallpaper in the bedroom, he has kept the decoration simple, scattering rugs and painting walls. In the first-floor drawing room, the long-suffering decorator tried three different shades before Frank hit on the ideal green: \u201cNot too leafy, not too cooking apple.\u201d Its depth acts as a foil for the 17th-century Dutch paintings \u2013 portraits, still lifes, landscapes \u2013 which Hollmeyer has bought at auctions over the years. Working from home during lockdown, he\u2019s had plenty of time to absorb their details.</p> <p>\u201cAcquaintances have become friends,\u201d says Hollmeyer, who also learned how to restore their gessoed frames using Dutch gilding. He\u2019s grown even fonder of his brown furniture, the stately wingback armchairs or the wavy, camel back sofa with its \u201cpatina of time\u201d. He\u2019s recovered them in plain, thick linens. There are no curtains anywhere. \u201cLike the window tax in England, the Dutch imposed a tax on curtains in the 17th century, so they were a rarity. I\u2019ve stayed faithful to that look.\u201d</p> <p>In the basement, he designed the country house-style kitchen, adding a butcher\u2019s block found online. Instead of conventional flagstones, there are French tomette tiles. Their subdued, pinkish tone is, he says, \u201cvery Dutch\u201d. When a more normal social life resumes, he\u2019s looking forward to laying the table for guests. There will be tulips in vases, bright Meissen plates and his signature prop: the lemon.</p> <p>\u201cAll you need is one for a splash of colour. It\u2019s an instant Dutch still life \u2013 on a budget.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><strong>Arsenal \u2013 Kristoffer Olsson (Krasnodar)</strong> In two years at Arsenal the Swede appeared in one matchday squad and made it on to the pitch for 36 minutes of a League Cup tie at West Brom (scoring in the penalty shootout). He moved on, initially to Midtjylland in Denmark, and after a spell at AIK in Sweden he joined Krasnodar in January 2019. This season he has been a key player in midfield, with his team second in Russia\u2019s Premier League.</p> <p><strong>Aston Villa \u2013 Pierluigi Gollini (Atalanta)</strong> A \u00a34.25m signing from the Serie B side Hellas Verona in 2016, Gollini held down a first-team spot for barely four months before Steve Bruce brought in Mark Bunn, more than 10 years Gollini\u2019s senior, before Christmas. \u201cBunn gives you that bit of experience,\u201d he said. \u201cI just felt with young Pier, it was a bit too much for him. I find him very young.\u201d The following month he joined Atalanta, initially on loan, and he has been their first-choice goalkeeper since March 2019. He has had an outstanding season and made his full international debut in November.</p> <p><strong>Bournemouth \u2013 Max Gradel (Toulouse) </strong>Not just an automatic first choice when fit but Toulouse\u2019s captain, the Ivorian contributed 13 goals and 10 assists last season \u2013 his best statistics since the year at Saint-\u00c9tienne that convinced Bournemouth to sign him in the summer of 2015. He spent two seasons on the south coast, starting 11 league games in the first and none in the second. This season he has three goals and three assists in 21 appearances in Ligue 1.</p> <p><strong>Brighton \u2013 Mathias Normann (Rostov)</strong> The then 21-year-old Norwegian signed in the summer of 2017, swiftly departed again on loan to Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s Molde. After returning for the first half of the following season he made a permanent move to Rostov in January 2019 without ever being considered worthy of a place in Brighton\u2019s first-team squad. The defensive midfielder has been a regular ever since, starting all 18 league games he has been available for this season and finishing 17, scoring one (excellent) goal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"db0bf3de7677a4f13433b56a0bc625ce7839e783\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db0bf3de7677a4f13433b56a0bc625ce7839e783/0_76_2017_1211/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mathias Normann celebrates scoring during Rostov\u2019s 2-1 win over Akhmat Grozny in their Russian Premier League match in September 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mathias Normann celebrates scoring during Rostov\u2019s 2-1 win over Akhmat Grozny in the Russian Premier League in September 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maxim Romanov/TASS via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Burnley \u2013 Rouwen Hennings (Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf) </strong>The German striker made only three league starts, scoring one goal, at Burnley during the 2015-16 season. \u201cWe\u2019re not expecting miracles out of him,\u201d Sean Dyche said. \u201cHe\u2019s shown signs and glimmers of what he\u2019s about and we think there\u2019s more to come.\u201d There was, though nobody saw it until he had been sent back to Germany on a free transfer. He started this season spectacularly, scoring 10 league goals by the end of November and though he could not keep up that pace his tally of 11 puts him fifth in the Bundesliga scoring charts.</p> <p><strong>Chelsea \u2013 Marko Marin (</strong><strong>al-Ahli)</strong> Chelsea spent around \u00a37m to sign the then 23-year-old midfielder from Werder Bremen in 2012. He had already won 16 full caps and been a member of Germany\u2019s squad for the 2010 World Cup but the move did not work out: he made only two league starts and played a total of 142 league minutes before heading out on a series of loan deals. He eventually joined Olympiakos in 2016 for around \u00a32.5m. Now 31 he moved to the Saudi club al-Ahli in January having captained Crvena Zvezda in the first half of the season, including every minute of the Serbian side\u2019s Champions League campaign (they lost 5-0 and 4-0 to Spurs, and 3-0 and 6-0 to Bayern Munich, but he set up two goals in their one victory, at home to Olympiakos).</p> <p><strong>Crystal Palace \u2013 Alexander S\u00f8rloth (Trabzonspor) </strong>The Norwegian praised \u201ca big club with ambition, a good club who takes good care of its players\u201d when he signed in January 2018 but after four games without a goal he was dropped, destined never to make another league start in England. But a player who scored only once in this country, against Swansea in the League Cup, has become the best marksman in Turkey, where he has scored 19 and created six in 26 appearances this season.</p> <p><strong>Everton \u2013 Joel Robles (Real Betis)</strong> Between August 2013 and May 2018 the Spaniard spent 140 Premier League games on Everton\u2019s bench and managed 39 starts. There were periods when he looked to have made the goalkeeper\u2019s jersey his own but none was very long; signed for \u00a33.6m, he left on a free transfer and after spending last season as back-up at Real Betis he has stepped up following Pau L\u00f3pez moved to Roma last summer.</p> <p><strong>Leicester \u2013 Andrej Kramaric (Hoffenheim) </strong>The Croat became Leicester\u2019s record signing for \u00a39.7m in January 2015. \u201cHe\u2019s an extremely talented young footballer,\u201d said Nigel Pearson of the then 23-year-old. \u201cHe is potentially a very important addition to us.\u201d That potential was never realised: he started five of next seven games and continued to make regular substitute appearances but spent only 22 minutes on the pitch in 2015-16. He joined Hoffenheim, initially on loan, almost exactly a year after his arrival. His five goals helped keep the club up that season and he made the move permanent in the summer of 2016. He has never left their first team, has scored 45 league goals in his three complete seasons and despite suffering several injuries had seven to his name when play stopped in March.</p> <p><strong>Liverpool \u2013 Luis Alberto (Lazio)</strong> Liverpool spent \u00a36.8m to sign the 20-year-old Spaniard, who could play across the forward line, in 2013, with Brendan Rodgers trilling \u201che has the correct footballing profile and mentality to be a Liverpool player\u201d. He never started a league game, making nine substitute appearances, and never scored before joining Lazio three years later for \u00a34.3m. He barely played in his first season but since 2017 has been a regular and this season, in a more withdrawn role at the base of midfield, has created 13 goals in 25 games \u2013 the most in Serie A \u2013 while scoring four of his own.</p> <p><strong>Manchester City \u2013 Olarenwaju Kayode (Gaziantep) </strong>A curious one, this. The Nigerian had been Austria\u2019s top scorer before City snapped up the then 24-year-old from Austria Vienna in the summer of 2017 for \u00a33.5m. But he never played for the club, instead moving immediately on loan to Girona. After starting two league games and scoring no goals he was sent back again in January 2018, saw a move to Amiens collapse for \u201cadministrative reasons\u201d and had a disappointing spell at Shakhtar Donetsk. He is now shining in Turkey, where he has nine goals and six assists this season.</p> <p><strong>Manchester United \u2013 Guillermo Varela (Copenhagen) </strong>After signing in 2013 aged 20 Varela had to wait two years for a chance but under Louis van Gaal in 2015-16 the Uruguayan was integrated into the first-team, making regular appearances in league and cups. \u201cHe\u2019s performing like he\u2019s been playing for 10 years,\u201d Juan Mata said. \u201cHe\u2019s a very competitive guy, he\u2019s good for the team so we are very happy for him.\u201d Then he started against Liverpool in the Europa League, did too little to stop Philippe Coutinho\u2019s run as he scored a brilliant goal just before half-time, was taken off at the break and never played again. He went on loan to Eintracht Frankfurt in 2016-17 but when a tattoo engraved against club instructions became infected before the cup final he was dropped, fined and sent back in disgrace. In 2017 he returned to his first club, Pe\u00f1arol, but came back to Europe in January 2019 to join Copenhagen and was enjoying the best season of his career before play was suspended in March.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6f943160cfed6e293dd334ce3badcfc65668344f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f943160cfed6e293dd334ce3badcfc65668344f/0_0_3511_2341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Copenhagen\u2019s Guillermo Varela (left) vies for the ball with Celtic\u2019s Odsonne \u00c9douard during their Europa League match at Celtic Park in February 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Copenhagen\u2019s Guillermo Varela (left) vies for the ball with Celtic\u2019s Odsonne \u00c9douard during their Europa League match at Celtic Park in February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Heppell/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Newcastle \u2013 Mikel Merino (Real Sociedad) </strong>During Merino\u2019s single season at Newcastle his ability was evident but Rafael Ben\u00edtez was not fully convinced by his Spanish compatriot. He managed only two league starts between the end of 2017 and the end of the campaign, because he was unable to dislodge Jonjo Shelvey and Mo Diam\u00e9 in central midfield. He started 24 of 38 league games last season but 25 of 26 this year as Real Sociedad unexpectedly rose to fourth in the table.</p> <p><strong>Norwich City \u2013 Vadis Odjidja-Ofoe (Gent)</strong> Norwich spent around \u00a34.5m to sign the 25-year-old Belgium midfielder in the summer of 2014. He started only one league game as Norwich won promotion in his first year and three in the Premier League the following season before being allowed to join Legia Warsaw on a free transfer. He was Poland\u2019s player of the following season but after one year moved to Olympiakos, where he experienced a chaotic campaign featuring three managers. In April was told by the club\u2019s chairman \u2013 and owner of Nottingham Forest \u2013 Evangelos Marinakis that he had no future there. He joined Gent in the summer of 2018 and became the captain this season. He had scored three goals and created eight when play was suspended.</p> <p><strong>Southampton \u2013 Mart\u00edn C\u00e1ceres (Fiorentina)</strong> C\u00e1ceres had already played for Juventus and<strong> </strong>Barcelona, as well as winning 68 caps for Uruguay, before he joined the Saints as a free agent in February 2017. Of the 13 league games between his arrival and the end of the season he started 12 on the bench, finished 12 on the bench, and actually appeared only once, in a 2-1 victory at Middlesbrough that May. He has since been passed around Serie A clubs \u2013 from Hellas Verona to Lazio, to Juventus, and then last summer to Fiorentina, where has has started 20 of the 22 league games he has been available for. He turned 33 this month (7 April).</p> <p><strong>Tottenham \u2013 Milos Veljkovic (Werder Bremen) </strong>Spurs spotted Veljkovic when the Serb was a 15-year-old at Basle and signed him a few weeks before his 16th birthday in 2011. He was at the club for nearly five years in which time he made three appearances, of two, 28 and four minutes\u2019 duration respectively. Loan moves to Charlton and Middlesbrough were unproductive and in January 2016 he left for Werder Bremen, who paid around \u00a3500,000. He has made 97 league appearances there and is once again a mainstay in defence after recovering from a broken toe that kept him out of the first five games.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c30267ebc88132c0c621b09b81902eb6b0574228\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c30267ebc88132c0c621b09b81902eb6b0574228/0_0_3595_2560/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Werder Bremen\u2019s Milos Veljkovic surges past Jadon Sancho of Borussia Dortmund at the Weserstadion in February 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"712\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Werder Bremen\u2019s Milos Veljkovic surges past Jadon Sancho of Borussia Dortmund at the Weserstadion in February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joern Pollex/Bongarts/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Sheffield United \u2013 Aymen Tahar (Panetolikos)</strong> The Sheffield-born midfielder of Algerian extraction came through the club\u2019s youth system but left in the summer of 2010 having made the first-team squad once and played a single minute of senior football in an FA Cup defeat by Hull City. When he joined Staveley Miners Welfare a future of globetrotting success seemed unlikely but a move to the Romanian side Gaz Metan Medias proved successful. He has since played for Steaua Bucharest (where he made three Champions League appearances, albeit in the qualifying rounds) and Boavista. He left Portugal last summer to join Panetolikos in Greece\u2019s top division and he has been involved in 20 of their 23 league games this season, all but three as a starter.</p> <p><strong>Watford \u2013 Steven Berghuis (Feyenoord)</strong> The Dutch winger lasted one season at Watford, arriving at the age of 23, before moving to Feyenoord, initially on loan. Of 38 Premier League games he was in the squad for only 16, made appearances in nine and started none. This season he is the Eredivisie\u2019s joint top scorer and joint third on the list of assists.</p> <p><strong>West Ham \u2013 Pablo Barrera (Pumas)</strong> Barrera signed for \u00a34m in the summer of 2010 having impressed for Mexico at the World Cup, promising to \u201cgive 100% and to play better than I have ever played before\u201d. He barely played at all, making six league starts in his one full season. Half a decent season on loan at Real Zaragoza followed (there were just five substitute appearances in the second half) before he returned to Mexico to join Cruz Azul. Now back at Pumas, his first club, where he won the title in 2009, and a regular in their first team.</p> <p><strong>Wolves \u2013 Silvio (Vitoria Set\u00fabal)</strong> One year, four starts and four managers was the extent of Silvio\u2019s experience in England but he has gone on to become a key player with Set\u00fabal in his native Portugal: this season he has missed one match through illness and played every minute of the other 23.</p>",

  "<h2>Aglio, olio e peperoncino</h2> <p><strong>Giorgio Locatelli<br></strong><em>Three ingredients: spaghetti, chilli, parmigiano reggiano</em></p> <p>This is one of my favourite dishes. It\u2019s one of the first things you can teach your children to cook \u2013 if they are adventurous with strong flavours \u2013 and it will stand them in good stead for the rest of their lives, when money is short or cooking for a gang at university or after a late night.</p> <p>My wife, Plaxy, cooks this for us when we arrive in Puglia on the silly o\u2019clock flight, having been up since 3am. A cold crisp white wine, a bowl of green salad and a plate of aglio olio e peperoncino before a siesta, and all is well with the world.</p> <p>The spaghetti should be made with Italian grains because the roughness of the surface will catch the oil better. Parmigiano reggiano or grana padano are the two cheeses that work best in this dish (I would recommend a cheese aged for 16-24 months). Always buy cheese in pieces, never buy pre-grated. You can use a variety of chilli, even dried. Some people like the chilli hotter, Plaxy only eats it with habanero \u2013 it is really down to your own taste.</p> <p><em>Serves 4</em><strong><br>spaghetti</strong> 500g<br><strong>chilli</strong> 1<br><strong>garlic</strong> 4 cloves<br><strong>extra virgin olive oil</strong> 200ml<br><strong>parmigiano reggiano or grana padano</strong> for serving, grated</p> <p>Start cooking the spaghetti in plenty of boiling salted water, and slice your chilli (around a tablespoonful, or more if you prefer) and the cloves of garlic about a millimetre thick.</p> <p>Place a little of the olive oil, cold, in the pan. Put in your garlic, then keep taking the pan off the heat and adding a little more cold oil, then returning it to the heat so that you don\u2019t burn the garlic.</p> <p>Once all the oil is in, you can let the garlic begin to take on a little bit of colour and put in your chopped chilli. Let it cook very briefly, stirring it into the garlic, then pull the pan from the heat and stir in a couple of spoonfuls of the cooking water from the pasta \u2013 take care, as it may spit.</p> <p>When the pasta is cooked but still al dente, lift it out and drain it, but keep back the cooking water.</p> <p>Toss the pasta really well through the oil, garlic and chilli, adding a little more cooking water from the pasta if it is too dry, as you want the garlicky hot oil to really cling to the spaghetti, and serve straightaway. Finish with some grated parmesan or grana padano.<br><em>Adapted from Made at Home by Giorgio Locatelli</em></p> <h2>Channa dal with wild garlic puree</h2> <p><strong>Ravinder Bhogal<br></strong><em>Three ingredients: wild garlic, lemon, channa dhal</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd078ce8828ddf117a848103e3014dfb46bb68a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd078ce8828ddf117a848103e3014dfb46bb68a0/0_136_1253_751/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ravinder Bhogal\u2019s channa dal with wild garlic puree.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ravinder Bhogal\u2019s channa dal with wild garlic puree.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Romas Foord/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Madhur Jaffrey calls dal \u201cLSD\u201d \u2013 life-saving dal \u2013 and I quite agree. It is cheap, nutritious, substantial and versatile and can be cooked with myriad ingredients, so it never gets boring. Channa dal is creamy, earthy and, cooked on its own, rather bland, so it lends itself particularly well to the grassy wild garlic we have growing in abundance every spring. If you can\u2019t get hold of wild garlic, use any herbs you have to hand \u2013 coriander, parsley, chervil or dill all add a vernal freshness too. I love the subtle flavour of it at the beginning of the season \u2013 like garlic without the fangs. Once the lentils have cooked, roughly mash, beat in a little cold butter and a zip of lemon, and finish with the wild garlic puree. You\u2019ll have a pool of something in a bowl that is nothing short of glorious.</p> <p><em>Serves 4<br>For the wild garlic puree</em><br><strong>wild garlic</strong> 100g, or mixed fresh herbs such as coriander, parsley, chervil or dill<br><strong>rapeseed oil</strong> 6 tbsp <br><strong>sea salt and pepper<br></strong><strong>lemon </strong>juice of \u00bd (reserve the other half for the dal)</p> <p><em>For the dal</em><br><strong>unsalted butter </strong>40g <br><strong>rapeseed oil </strong>1 tbsp<br><strong>whole cumin seeds</strong> 2 heaped tsp<br><strong>chilli flakes</strong> \u00bd tsp<br><strong>garlic</strong> 3 fat cloves, finely sliced<br><strong>lemon </strong>zest of 1<br><strong>channa dal or split yellow peas</strong> 250g, washed well<br><strong>ground turmeric</strong> 1 tsp <br><strong>sea salt and pepper</strong> to taste</p> <p>Begin by making the puree. Roughly chop the wild garlic or fresh herbs. If your wild garlic is flowering and you are feeling fancy, reserve some so you can add a pretty garnish later. Put into a blender along with the rapeseed oil and blitz until you have a smooth puree. Stir in the lemon juice and seasoning. Empty into a bowl and set aside.</p> <p>Heat 15g of the butter in a large saucepan and add a little oil to stop it burning. Sizzle the cumin and chilli flakes along with the sliced garlic and lemon zest until fragrant. Sprinkle in the turmeric and 1.2 litres of water, along with the channa dal and bring to a boil. At this point you could also add half a tin of tomatoes or some fresh skinned and pureed tomatoes if you like.</p> <p>Turn the heat to low and then simmer partially covered for around 45 minutes until the lentils are soft and creamy. For speedier cooking, invest in a pressure cooker. I don\u2019t know an Indian housewife who doesn\u2019t own one. If you want it thin and soupy feel free to add more water, but I like mine a little more robust.</p> <p>Season with salt and pepper and roughly mash. Beat in the remaining butter and squeeze in the juice from the leftover lemon. To serve, dish out into bowls and top with a dollop of wild garlic puree and any reserved flowers. Eat on its own like a soup or serve with rice or hot puffs of chapati. I really enjoy it with a little cheese toastie to dip in it.<br><em>Ravinder Bhogal is chef-founder of Jikoni</em></p> <h2><strong>Crispy chicken thighs, spinach and goat\u2019s cheese</strong></h2> <p><strong>Anna Haugh<br></strong><em>Three ingredients: chicken thighs, baby spinach, goat\u2019s cheese</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8d3fcc84f729ddf8dddb18524406c852cc262d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8d3fcc84f729ddf8dddb18524406c852cc262d9/491_1515_5306_5306/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Haugh\u2019s crispy chicken thighs, spinach and goat\u2019s cheese.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anna Haugh\u2019s crispy chicken thighs, spinach and goat\u2019s cheese.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Romas Foord/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Here is a recipe that is so simple and tasty that you might do the chicken dance with delight. I\u2019m a leg girl \u2013 chicken legs and thighs have the best flavour in my opinion, as they are juicy and delicious. The brown meat, as it is referred to, has more flavour than the chicken breast but mysteriously is less popular.</p> <p>This is healthy fast food \u2013 or it\u2019s what fast food should be. Goat\u2019s cheese is easier to digest than cow\u2019s cheese and I love the slightly sour zing you get from a good one: it complements the spinach puree excellently and gives much more depth of flavour to the dish, not to mention the calcium and bundles of other good vitamins. The spinach is packed with vitamin K \u2013 trust me, your bones will thank you for this.</p> <p><em>Serves 2<br></em><strong>cooking oil </strong>1 tsp<br><strong>chicken thighs</strong> 4<br><strong>salt and pepper</strong> to season<br><strong>butter </strong>20g<strong><br>salt</strong> a good pinch<br><strong>baby spinach</strong> 200g<br><br><strong>sugar</strong> a pinch<br><strong>goat\u2019s cheese </strong>80g</p> <p>Place a frying pan on a medium heat and pour in your cooking oil. Season your chicken thighs with salt and pepper, place in the pan and cook until the skin becomes crispy. This will take around 10 minutes.</p> <p>While your chicken cooks, in a medium pot, put the butter, a good pinch of salt and most of your spinach (keep a handful to garnish). When the spinach wilts down (this is super quick) pop into a blender and blitz. You might need to add a drop of water to make the puree liquid enough.</p> <p>Your chicken should almost be done. Check it\u2019s crispy and if it is, flip it onto the other side while you get your plates and cutlery ready. After a minute or two you\u2019re ready to serve.</p> <p>Serve the spinach puree on the bottom of your plate or bowl, then break your goat\u2019s cheese into chunks.

I\u2019ve always been a fan of surf and turf. Not a huge steak with a few limp prawns skewered and plonked on top but the complex union of flavours between sea and earth. On the surface of things, creatures from the deep aren\u2019t the obvious partner to marry with meat and poultry but think about the multitude of combinations of pork and shrimp, beef and anchovy, cockles and bacon, lamb stew punctuated with seaweed, to name but a few. Salt marsh lamb is prized for its flavour \u2013 achieved by its diet of samphire, sea beat and sorrel after grazing close to beaches and estuaries. I prefer Barnsley chops or lamb loin chops as they are generally cut a little thicker than best end chops but both are quick and easy to cook. The garnish goes equally well with braised shoulder or shanks or a roasted leg. This dish can also be easily replicated on the barbecue if you\u2019re so inclined. Bottarga is available online but you can toss some chopped anchovies through the broccoli instead and the dish will be just as delicious.</p> <p><em>Serves 4<br></em><strong>Barnsley chops</strong> (sometimes known as lamb loin chops) 4, preferably with a decent layer of fat<br><strong>salt and pepper</strong> to season<br><strong>purple sprouting broccoli</strong> a good handful per person<br><strong>bottarga</strong> a good thumb-sized piece or<br><strong>salted anchovies</strong> 1 small tin, room temperature<br><strong>unsalted butter</strong> 150g, plus a knob for cooking the chops (around 25g)<br><strong>chilli flakes </strong>1-2 tsp <br><strong>sumac</strong> 1 tsp<br><strong>oil</strong> for cooking</p> <p>Take the lamb chops out of the fridge about 40 minutes before you want to cook them. Season the lamb at this point too.</p> <p>First blanch the broccoli. To do this, bring a pot of water to the boil, season with a pinch of salt and throw in the broccoli. While it is cooking, fill a large bowl with iced water. Boil the broccoli till just tender. Drain it through a colander then shock in a waiting bowl of ice water. If you don\u2019t have any ice to hand, place the bowl of water under a running cold tap for a couple of minutes till the broccoli is cool. Return to the colander to drain for a further few minutes. Ensure it\u2019s as dry as possible, as water will cause the broccoli to spit when it comes into contact with the hot oil. When drained, refrigerate till needed.</p> <p>To bring the dish together, melt the 150g of butter and keep it in a resting tray. Remove the broccoli from the fridge, making sure it\u2019s as dry as can be. Get your frying pan hot before you cook the chops, especially if you want to achieve decent caramelisation which is where you can really accentuate the flavour of this lamb. When the pan is hot, rub the chops all over with a glug of oil. Carefully lay the chops in the pan - fat-side down - to render some of that lovely fat. If the pan doesn\u2019t make a satisfying sizzle when you put your chops in, it\u2019s not hot enough. When the fat has rendered and each side of the lamb chop has a pleasing golden hue, I like to add a good knob of butter as it helps with the caramelisation I mentioned, but this is optional.</p> <p>How long your chops take to cook depends on their thickness. Obviously if your chops are on the thin side, a minute or two on either side in a hot pan and a decent warm rest will do it. Thicker chops will take a little longer and you might want to reduce the heat slightly while frying, about 3-4 minutes on each side. Lamb chops are best served medium-rare. You can gauge this by pressing your finger against the eye of meat in the chop. If it is soft it\u2019s probably under. If it\u2019s super firm it\u2019s probably over so aim for somewhere in the middle. Remember you can always cook a chop a bit more to get it to where you want it but you can never uncook something. Rest for a further 5 minutes in the tray of melted butter, and add the chilli flakes.</p> <p>While the lamb is resting, wipe out the frying pan and get it hot again. Add a glug of oil and chuck in the broccoli. Allow the broccoli to char and blacken in parts. When the broccoli is done, turn off the heat.

The citrus properties of sumac will give the dish a nice hit of acidity.</p> <p>Place the broccoli beside the chop and grate a generous amount of bottarga, or put 3-4 whole anchovy fillets, if using, over the broccoli and a few turns of black pepper from the mill.

The pairing of orange and rhubarb is one we adore, the colour and flavour equally beguiling. Made with blood oranges when the rhubarb stems are coloured a deep scarlet, the appearance and flavour become otherworldly, not to mention striking. When the rhubarb is spooned over ricotta beaten with olive oil, the rich savour of the cheese is sweetened by the delightful vanilla-infused orange and rhubarb syrup that forms in the pan when the rhubarb is cooked. Modest and moreish, this makes for an excellent breakfast as well as an elegant pudding for lunch and, of course, dinner.</p> <p><em>Serves 6<br>For the compote</em><br><strong>rhubarb</strong> 750g <br><strong>caster sugar</strong> 100g <br><strong>orange</strong> 1 small, zest finely grated then juiced<br><strong>vanilla pod</strong> 1, split and scraped</p> <p><em>For the ricotta</em><br><strong>ricotta</strong> 250g<br><strong>best olive oil</strong> 2 dsp</p> <p>Wash the rhubarb well and dry.

  "<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been asked \u2013 and we\u2019ve asked ourselves \u2013 why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-latest-at-a-glance-thursday\">Covid-19</a> seems to be impacting Princess so heavily.\u201d Thus spoke Jan Swartz, president of Princess Cruises, in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZC1jVkY9hqE\">video posted</a> on social media in mid-March. She looks sad-eyed and baffled into the camera: \u201cWe don\u2019t really know.\u201d Perhaps, she muses, the problem is something to do with the \u201cdiverse mix of people onboard our ships\u201d and is \u201cbeing magnified by our core values to respect, protect and connect the world\u201d. She implores her \u201cguests\u201d with a \u201csimple request\u201d: \u201cWe ask you to book a future Princess cruise to your dream destination \u2026 as a symbol to the world that the things that connect us are stronger than those that divide us.\u201d </p> <p>Her company does seem to have been terribly unlucky. Their <a href=\"https://www.ship-technology.com/news/covid-19-diamond-princess-cruise-ship-eighth-death/\">Diamond Princess</a>, quarantined off Yokohama, which suffered over 700 infections and eight deaths among its passengers and crew, was a conspicuous early victim of the pandemic, its global fame growing on wry-turning-to-desperate postings from its passengers. The Ruby Princess, from which 2,700 passengers disembarked in Sydney on March 19, became the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/criminal-investigation-launched-ruby-princess-cruise-ship-coronavirus-disaster\">single largest source of Covid-19 cases in Australia</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/from-paradise-to-coronavirus-the-grand-princess-and-the-cruise-from-hell\">Grand Princess</a> was stuck outside San Francisco, its passengers confined to their cabins, after an outbreak in early March. Something similar happened to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/coral-princess-cruise-ship-docks-florida-coronavirus-pandemic\">Coral Princess</a> in early April, off the coast of Florida. And this to say nothing of the <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/tourism-cruises/article240761311.html\">Caribbean Princess</a>, which has twice this year had to end cruises early, due to hundreds falling ill from a quite different infection, the vomiting bug norovirus.</p> <p>But not everyone is yet convinced that all of Princess\u2019s misadventures are purely bad luck. New South Wales police have launched a criminal investigation into the Ruby Princess, to see whether its owners were \u201ctransparent in contextualising the true patient and crew health conditions relevant to Covid-19\u201d. They are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/criminal-investigation-launched-ruby-princess-cruise-ship-coronavirus-disaster\">suspected of lying</a>, in other words, about conditions on the ship. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-cruiseship-law/passengers-sue-over-coronavirus-hit-grand-princess-cruise-ship-idUSKBN20W30T\">Legal actions</a> have sprung up from unhappy \u201cguests\u201d of the Grand Princess, their trips-of-a-lifetime wrecked by allegedly inadequate screening procedures. Professor Kentaro Iwata, a Japanese expert on infectious diseases who went on to the Diamond Princess, described the onboard response to the virus as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/02/scientist-decries-completely-chaotic-conditions-cruise-ship-japan-quarantined-after#\">completely chaotic</a>\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a53e45a0502b247b90ec7290a5fd7ec3f7cf45e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a53e45a0502b247b90ec7290a5fd7ec3f7cf45e8/220_0_3280_1969/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Princess Cruises president, Jan Swartz, greets passengers from the Diamond Princess as they disembark after their quarantine on 20 February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Princess Cruises president, Jan Swartz, greets passengers from the Diamond Princess as they disembark after their quarantine on 20 February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Princess Cruises/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Princess is not alone in its troubles. It is one of several lines owned by Carnival Corporation, a giant and aggressive company, which as long ago as 1996 was reported by David Foster Wallace, in an <a href=\"https://harpers.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/HarpersMagazine-1996-01-0007859.pdf\">epic article</a> on the cruise experience, to be nicknamed \u201cCarnivore\u201d. Carnival\u2019s roughly <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_cruise_lines\">40% share of the market</a> also includes the Holland America line, which owns the Zaandam, which had to travel up the west coast of South America with sick and dying passengers on board, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/apr/07/zaandam-onboard-the-coronavirus-hit-cruise-ship\">Chile closed its ports</a>. Other ships, both owned by Carnival and not, have had outbreaks of disease or been denied permission to enter ports. All new cruises have now been suspended, with some provisionally scheduled to <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/cruises/articles/cruise-lines-suspending-operations-over-coronavirus/\">restart in May</a>.</p> <p>A rather obvious question is whether Covid-19 is simply an act of God, or whether its impact on their passengers, crew and host ports has been magnified by the practices of cruise companies. They vigorously push back against this suggestion: a spokesman for Carnival tells me that \u201cthe cruise industry took action before most other industries on land took actions\u201d, that \u201ccruise ships are social gathering places, but no less risky than any other social gathering venue\u201d, and asks \u201cwhen was the last time you were asked to fill out a health record before being allowed to enter a concert?\u201d In the case of the Diamond Princess, say Princess Cruises, they were following instructions from the Japanese health authorities.</p> <p>Trust on this question, on the other hand, is not improved by reports that some cruise-line salespeople (not Carnival), in mid-March, were being instructed to talk punters out of their concerns about Covid-19, for example claiming that the coronavirus could not survive in tropical climates and that therefore it was a good time to visit the Caribbean. Trust is further weakened by the cruise industry\u2019s long history of environmental and safety lapses, and their special skill at minimising the consequences to themselves.</p> <p>A bigger question is whether the virus will dent, deflect or alter what has been a phenomenon of our times, the many-times multiplication of ship sizes, of passenger numbers and of profits, generated by an industry that manufactures its own version of reality, then shapes the places that its ships visit in the image of that reality. Cruises, as Wallace put it, serve that \u201cpart of me that craves pampering and passive pleasure: the dissatisfied-infant part of me, the part that always and indiscriminately <em>wants</em>\u201d. Cruises are founded on fantasy, which means the removal from view of anything irksome or demanding of difficult choices.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b9a1dd891f550306dbe490afdfde8ca614f95a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b9a1dd891f550306dbe490afdfde8ca614f95a5/0_46_1407_844/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Medics transport a body from the MS Zaandam, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 2 April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Medics transport a body from the MS Zaandam, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 2 April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SMG/Zuma Press/PA Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cruise companies have been growing at least since the 1980s, with a 7.2% compounded <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemicallef/2020/01/20/state-of-the-cruise-industry-smooth-sailing-into-the-2020s/#46c597465fa2\">rate of revenue growth</a> from 2010 to 2019. Their ships, which were generally under 50,000 tons until the mid-90s, have become beasts of 220,000 tons and more. Alongside the growth in quantity has gone an ever-advancing science of customer experience, of investment in ice rinks, climbing walls, spas and casinos, in decking out ships like Vegas resorts, a process that reached some kind of apogee with the 5.260-passenger <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/cruises/news/venice-themed-cruise-ship-with-its-own-st-marks-square-built-for-chinese/\">Costa Venezia</a>. Aimed at the Asian market, this Venice-themed ship comes<strong> </strong>complete with gondola rides and a version of the Piazza San Marco. For cruising is above all an entertainment and hospitality industry, albeit grafted on to the serious engineering needed to keep large ships afloat.</p> <p>All of which might be good, clean fun, if the growth of cruises weren\u2019t accompanied by reports of pollution spills, outbreaks of disease, accidents, mistreatment of workers and sexual assaults and other crimes. If these reports don\u2019t change much over the decades it is because the cruise lines don\u2019t change much, either. They can spend lavishly on lobbying and campaign contributions to friendly politicians, and hire lawyers to see off the lawsuits when things go wrong. Their business being offshore, cruise lines are free to choose the countries where they register their ships and incorporate their business, which means places like Panama, the Bahamas or Bermuda, where they can <a href=\"https://thehustle.co/the-economics-of-cruise-ships/\">pay low taxes and get an easy ride</a> on labour rights, and on health, safety and environmental regulations.</p> <p>\u201cThey only change when they have to,\u201d says Ross Klein, a sociology professor at Memorial University in Newfoundland, whose website <a href=\"http://cruisejunkie.com/\">cruisejunkie.com</a> chronicles the mishaps of the cruise business. And nobody much makes them change. There is<strong> </strong>a trade body, the <a href=\"https://cruising.org/\">Cruise Lines International Association</a> (CLIA), which promotes the business and in theory upholds standards. \u201cThey will tell you that they have mandatory regulations and that they meet or exceed international regulations,\u201d says Klein. \u201cWell, we asked CLIA\u2019s senior vice-president what happens when a company violates these regulations: nothing. Perhaps a stern talking-to, but otherwise nothing.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It's not just the filth and damage that ships emit, but the superficial interaction that cruise ships generate</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Cruise companies\u2019 aversion to responsibility can be seen in a legendary court filing following the \u201c<a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2013/12/17/travel/carnival-cruise-triumph-problems/index.html\">poop cruise</a>\u201d of 2013, in which failing generators on the Carnival Triumph caused a backup of raw sewage into the passenger areas. Carnivals\u2019 lawyers, CNN reported, said that the \u201cticket contract makes absolutely no guarantee for safe passage, a seaworthy vessel, adequate and wholesome food, and sanitary and safe living conditions.\u201d Equally striking was the legal outcome to the 2012 wreck of the Costa Concordia, when the party atmosphere of cruises mixed fatally with questions of navigation: the owner Costa Crociere (another part of the Carnival empire), with the help of a plea bargain and \u20ac1m fine, and despite <a href=\"https://lloydslist.maritimeintelligence.informa.com/LL1120956/Marine-professionals-call-for-jailed-Costa-Concordia-masters-case-to-be-reviewed\">clear failings</a> on its part, was freed of any management and operational responsibility.</p> <p>Or you could take another incident that befell the ever unfortunate Princess Cruise lines, when the Caribbean Princess was found to have been dumping oily waste in the sea off southern England. In 2017 a Florida court found that the Caribbean and four more Princesses had been engaging in <a href=\"https://www.cruiselawnews.com/2016/12/articles/pollution/deliberate-dumping-coverup-and-lies-doj-fines-princess-cruises-40000000/\">illegal practices</a>, issued a <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/cruise-line-ordered-pay-40-million-illegal-dumping-oil-contaminated-waste-and-falsifying\">record fine of $40m</a> and put the company on probation for five years. President Jan Swartz performed a hand-wring to camera, as she has over Covid-19, to say that \u201cwe are very sorry for the actions of our employees\u201d and that \u201cthe marine environment is incredibly important to us\u201d.</p> <p>Princess ships then continued to pollute, for example by depositing faecal coliform in Alaskan waters. In 2019 they were <a href=\"http://www.cruisejunkie.com/envirofines.html\">fined a further $20m</a>. If a combined penalty of $60m sounds like a lot, it is as Klein points out a small portion of the $3bn or so <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/carnival-corporation--plc-reports-fourth-quarter-and-record-full-year-earnings-300769295.html\">annual profits</a> of Princess\u2019s owner, Carnival. \u201cTo them, that\u2019s just a cost of doing business,\u201d he says.</p> <p>And you have <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-55238-z\">Venice</a>, the actual city rather than the theme versions, where for years what are effectively multistorey hotels have been looming over its historic architecture, their mighty parps competing with church bells, their diesel<strong> </strong>smoke polluting the air, damaging the ecology of the lagoon and, say protesters, the foundations of buildings with the water they displace, and discharging thousands-strong fluxes of tourists on highly managed six-hour trinket-and-selfie binges in the city. Then, last summer, the 65,000-ton MSC Opera, its engine failing, crunched into a moored tourist boat like a boot on to a bug. There were miraculously no deaths, but the crash made the cruise industry\u2019s previous assurances of safety sound hollow.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dfedb9ea2f3b77a87f3c724bd0547e33d3b2229d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dfedb9ea2f3b77a87f3c724bd0547e33d3b2229d/0_374_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A cruise ship passing by the San Marco Square in the Giudecca canal, Venice, 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A cruise ship passing by the San Marco Square in the Giudecca canal, Venice, 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marco Di Lauro/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-49276730\">excited reports</a> last year that large ships would be banned from the city, nothing definite has been decided. At most, larger ships will be displaced to other ports in the Venetian lagoon, which would involve new environmental impacts. Among <a href=\"https://skift.com/2019/08/19/venices-big-money-conundrum-to-solving-its-cruise-ship-crisis/\">the complications</a> in finding a solution is the fact that Carnival, Royal Caribbean and other big cruise companies are shareholders of the company that owns Venice\u2019s maritime port.</p> <p>The issue is not just about the filth and damage that ships emit into Venetian air and water, but of the superficial interaction that cruise ships generate between passengers and their host city. Eleonora Sovrani, of the local campaign group <a href=\"https://weareherevenice.org/\">We Are Here Venice</a>, argues that the cruises\u2019 \u201cguests\u201d \u2013 on their brief visits, following itineraries proposed by the ships, visiting outlets suggested by them \u2013 never leave the cruise \u201cbubble\u201d. The city is forced \u201cto change its aspect to answer expectations of the cruise companies,\u201d she says, in what is a form of \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d.</p> <p>What goes for Venice now goes for many other places in the world. In pre-virus Sydney, successive ships would be moored near the considerably smaller Opera House, almost permanently blocking certain views, while others would be waiting their turn out in the bay. Cruises have shown increasing enthusiasm for invading the Arctic and Antarctic, their paths eased by the melting of globally warmed ice, with many thousands of gawpers descending on tiny Inuit settlements. In New Zealand, Princess Cruises \u2013 hello, my old friend \u2013 were obliged to apologise for their crassness, after some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/02/cruise-company-apologises-after-staff-pose-as-maori-for-traditional-welcome\">non-Maori men</a> with DIY skirts and scribbles on their face were hired to perform an am-dram version of a traditional Maori welcome to passengers on the Golden Princess.</p> <p>To all these points<strong> </strong>the cruise industry naturally has its responses. <a href=\"https://cruising.org/about-the-industry/policy-priorities/public-health-and-medical/nororvirus-on-cruise-ships\">They make claims</a> about health, safety and the environment, which for the reasons given by Ross Klein should be treated sceptically. They say, for example, that <a href=\"https://cruising.org/about-the-industry/policy-priorities/public-health-and-medical/nororvirus-on-cruise-ships\">norovirus is rare</a> on cruise ships, using data from the US <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. The CDC, however, is only able to obtain information on ships that visit US ports, so can\u2019t give global statistics, which limits the usefulness of any conclusions that might be drawn.</p> <p>Cruise companies argue that they create employment, which they do, for everyone from officers to crew to waiters to beauticians and standup comedians. They say that they bring revenue to their host cities, which they also do, though Klein and others <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0261517717302418\">dispute the level of benefits</a> claimed by the companies</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cadfe9b58d82b8aef0dc2f894c71122cf32b0a28\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cadfe9b58d82b8aef0dc2f894c71122cf32b0a28/0_65_5760_3458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The bar and dancefloor of the Costa Fortuna, owned by the Carnival corporation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The bar and dancefloor of the Costa Fortuna, owned by the Carnival corporation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frans Lemmens/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since cruise passengers sleep on their ships and also tend to eat and drink on them, their benefit to local hotels, restaurants and bars is limited. Those shore-based traders to whom the ships direct their passengers generally have to pay a handsome cut for the privilege. Cruise lines also acquire interests in terminals and retail outlets, such that even more income is whisked away from their host ports. Just supposing that the tourist dollar were not so relentlessly hoovered up by cruises, might it not be generating other, maybe more rewarding jobs in businesses that don\u2019t have the same breaks on taxes and regulations?</p> <p>The cruise companies\u2019 strongest argument is that their customers love their product. Which, mostly, they do. Even some who endured the Covid-cursed cruises say they will go back to the ships when they can. And to sail the seas and see the world is, indeed, a great thing. But perhaps cruise passengers would have an even better time if there weren\u2019t a nagging feeling that the management might not be totally on top of novel or familiar viruses on their ship, or that the excretions and eructations of their big white ships are trashing the beauties they are paying to see.</p> <p>And claims of passenger satisfaction and revenue-generation should not invalidate the wishes of host cities for basic respect or the argument that the quality of interaction between tourists and locals is as important as the quantity. As Sovrani puts it, cruises should adapt to cities, not the other way round. Again, cruise passengers might have a better time if they were not thrust into the cogs of an engine of exploitation.</p> <p>Much, of course, depends on what happens in the world to come after the virus, which not so long ago was barely a blip on the radar. <em>Forbes</em> magazine, on January 20, could see only \u201c<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemicallef/2020/01/20/state-of-the-cruise-industry-smooth-sailing-into-the-2020s/#36bb9cc065fa\">smooth sailing</a> into the 2020s\u201d. In February CNN quoted various experts saying it was <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/cruise-safety-coronavirus/index.html\">still OK to cruise</a>. The <a href=\"https://cruisedialogue2020.org/\">Cruise Dialogue conference</a> met in Cartagena, Colombia, also in February, asking its industry delegates and speakers \u201chow best to accommodate the seemingly unstoppable growth of cruise activities?\u201d Almost no one mentioned the virus.</p> <p>The Zaandam set off on its disastrous voyage on 7 March (when, as Klein points out, a number of ships had already been turned away from ports). On the previous day there was the first talk of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/06/white-house-could-seek-timely-targeted-aid-us-industries-hurt-by-coronavirus-outbreak-top-adviser-says/\">federal help</a> for the cruise industry, an idea that seemed open to doubt, given the cruise companies\u2019 exotic registrations: if they don\u2019t pay US taxes, how could they receive US subsidies? Even <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/489788-cruise-lines-excluded-from-coronavirus-stimulus-bill\">President Trump</a>, who notwithstanding those pesky Panamanian and Bahamian flags called cruises \u201ca great US business\u201d, acknowledged the problem, before saying that \u201cwe\u2019re going to try and work something out\u201d. Which, not least because Carnival\u2019s chairman Micky Arison is a friend and backer of Trump, the company having been a sponsor of <em>The Apprentice</em>, you can be sure he will try very hard to do.</p> <p>\u201cThe infantile part of me,\u201d wrote David Foster Wallace, \u201cis by its very nature insatiable.\u201d However much gratification and pampering it will receive, it \u201cwill simply adjust its desires upward until it once again levels out at its homeostasis of terrible dissatisfaction.\u201d He could as well have been describing the cruise business as its customer experience. Now, though, it is time for cruises to grow up: if the industry has been based on the outsourcing of reality, reality has come back to bite it. A CLIA spokeswoman tells me that they \u201caim to do our part to protect the sanctity of the destinations we visit so that they can remain a vibrant place to live and visit for generations to come\u201d. Let\u2019s hope so: if it wants public money and public trust, the cruise business should accept the public responsibilities it has been so good at shirking.</p>",

If you imagine, even asking someone six days later to account every movement over a period of time, it\u2019s an incredibly hard task.</p> \n  <p>\u201cSo I would ask New Zealanders to have new practises, new things that they do at the end of the day.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe better that we are able to do ... the sooner we can move through down the alert levels and the sooner life feels more normal.\u201d</p> \n  <p>On Monday, cabinet will meet to decide whether to end four weeks of level four restrictions and downscale to a level three lockdown, which mirrors many of Australia\u2019s restrictions.</p> \n  <p>That will include re-opening schools, allowing more businesses \u2013 including the construction and forestry industries \u2013 to get back to work and let restaurants operate for delivery orders only.</p> \n  <p>It will also allow Kiwis to extend their bubbles of people with which they have personal contact, which presents a challenge for contact tracing.</p> \n  <p>Contact tracing is the process where health officials track down people that have been in contact with confirmed cases of Covid-19, asking them to self-isolate and get tested.</p> \n  <p>Just as in Australia, officials are hoping to use a tracking app to assist the process, along with diary entries.</p> \n  <p>On Sunday, health officials announced just nine new cases across the country, the eighth straight day in which new cases have been no higher than 20.</p> \n  <p>The country\u2019s death toll stands at 12, after the death of a man in Invercargill last Tuesday was confirmed to be linked to Covid-19.</p> \n  <p>In keeping with the country\u2019s health-first approach, Ardern announced four criteria that would decide whether the country would relax its restrictions \u2013 with none related to the economy.</p> \n  <p>The first is the satisfaction of health professionals that undetected community transmission is unlikely.</p> \n  <p>The second is strong contact tracing capacity, the third is the strength of border controls and the the fourth is the health system\u2019s ability to stand up.</p> \n  <p>\u201cOur focus has been to protect the health of New Zealanders,\u201d Ardern said, while acknowledging the hurt in the business community.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe best thing for the economy has been to stop the virus.

  "<p>Writer-director Tayarisha Poe has wryly described her debut feature (which played to enthusiastic responses at Sundance last year) as \u201c<em>Clueless </em>meets <em>The Godfather\u201d</em>. Set amid the five warring factions of an elite east coast US boarding school, it\u2019s a woozy, hallucinogenic drama that reimagines the landscape of high school as a a daytime-noir terrain of crime and punishment, tangentially reminiscent of the life-and-death struggles of Rian Johnson\u2019s arresting 2005 debut <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/may/14/philipfrench\">Brick</a></em>. Picked up by Amazon, which swiftly started developing a spin-off TV project, <em>Selah and the Spades</em> is an audacious calling card for Poe, marking her down as a major talent to watch.</p> <p>Lovie Simone exudes a brooding sense of purpose as Selah Summers, leader of the titular pack who run Haldwell school\u2019s thriving supply of illicit substances. It\u2019s the spring term of her senior year, and Selah, who will soon be leaving Haldwell, is looking for someone to whom she can pass the baton of power, to \u201censure her legacy\u201d. She thinks she\u2019s found the perfect candidate in upcoming shutterbug Paloma (Celeste O\u2019Connor), whom Selah imagines that she can \u201cteach\u201d, or mould in her own image (inevitable shades of Jane Austen\u2019s endlessly reinterpretable <em>Emma</em>). But tensions are rising between Selah and her right-hand man Maxxie (<em>Moonlight</em>\u2019s<em> </em>Jharrel Jerome), threatening the stability of her empire, and revealing cracks in Selah\u2019s otherwise ice-cool exterior.</p> <p>Beginning life as an online multimedia project in 2014, <em>Selah and the Spades</em> reportedly grew out of Poe\u2019s response to a period of disaffection while working in a digital tech lab. \u201cI wanted to tell a story about a girl who knew what she wanted,\u201d she told <em>Filmmaker</em> magazine in 2015, characterising her anti-heroine as \u201ca girl who runs a gang and is totally OK with doing whatever she needs to do to make that gang successful\u201d.</p> <p>Yet perfectionist Selah\u2019s confidence only extends as far as the boundaries of the insular school grounds. In a telling scene with her quietly scolding mother, we see that Selah (who has a dark secret in her past) can be just as scared as her contemporaries of what awaits her when this particular dream is over. \u201cIt will put you in your place,\u201d her mother tells her, \u201cit will keep you safe from yourself\u201d, adding curtly that \u201csomething has to\u201d. But Selah doesn\u2019t need reminding that what she has is transient, and that her queen bee, straight-A status may not be sustainable for long. All the more reason to live it to the full while it lasts\u2026</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nK6WFgdchM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-nK6WFgdchM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nK6WFgdchM\">Watch a trailer for Selah and the Spades.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Citing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/07/oreo-fran-ross-novel-marlon-james\">Fran Ross\u2019s 1974 novel </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/07/oreo-fran-ross-novel-marlon-james\">Oreo</a></em> and Geoffrey Fletcher\u2019s 2011 film <em>Violet &amp; Daisy</em><em> </em>as influences, Poe has created something that is simultaneously familiar and surprising \u2013 combining the hazy nature of teenage years with the more brutal power struggles of adult life, thrown together in a larger-than-life environment that is utterly artificial but still grounded in down-to-earth reality. At times, I was reminded of the rebellious spirit of C\u00e9line Sciamma\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/10/girlhood-gritty-teen-life-review-mark-kermode\">Girlhood</a> (Bande des f</em><em>illes)</em>, a vivid coming-of-age story that viewed its rites of passage through the prism of a Parisian girl gang. But this is altogether more surreal, a quality emphasised by Jomo Fray\u2019s richly saturated cinematography, which floats ethereally down confined corridors, up candlelit staircases, and through idyllic woodland retreats, drenching the screen in verdant hues that contrast sharply with the satirical bite of the action.</p> <p>There\u2019s an equally expressionist edge to the soundtrack, which jumbles hard-cut jukebox selections with almost sci-fi-inflected tonal mood-scapes, weaving in and out of the dialogue. At times, composer Aska Matsumiya\u2019s beautifully off-kilter cues reminded me of Jon Brion\u2019s disorienting work on Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Observer_review/0,,891865,00.html\">Punch-Drunk Love</a></em>, the layered sound-design lending an air of tension to even the most apparently innocuous scenes.</p> <p>As with many first features, there are some shortcomings. At times, it\u2019s hard to tell whether the contrivances of the script and the stiltedness of some of the performances are archly deliberate or accidental, a quality that can break the spell of the movie\u2019s trancey atmosphere. During these moments, it\u2019s tempting to view <em>Selah and the Spades</em> as a triumph of style over substance, richer in visual promise than thematic rewards.</p> <p>Yet there\u2019s also something thrilling about Poe\u2019s refusal to smooth the odd and potentially alienating edges off this very personal (and ultimately empowering) drama, suggesting a strength of creative purpose that will doubtless pay great dividends.

  "<p>It\u2019s amazing how quickly everyday things can suddenly come to feel quite extraordinary. After queuing for 45 minutes to do my weekly food shop, walking through the supermarket doors felt strangely emotional \u2013 the sight of such bewildering choice, particularly of fruit and veg, stopped me in my tracks. Despite having seen this thousands of times before, the ability of the modern food system to offer up such plenty, even in the midst of a worldwide pandemic, really felt like a minor miracle.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Many traditionally foraged foods have disappeared from our diets</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the not-so-distant past, this time of year was known as the \u201chungry gap\u201d. Stores of winter crops were running perilously low and the first spring harvests were still a few weeks away. Many people were forced to wade into ice-cold streams to gather watercress to stave off hunger pangs, which gives the plant its traditional nickname: \u201cpoor man\u2019s bread\u201d. Thanks to the work of scientists, farmers, truck drivers, shelf-stackers and hundreds of others who rarely get much credit, the term \u201chungry gap\u201d is one that is today little known beyond hobby veg growers.</p> <p>This newfound plenty has, however, meant that many traditionally foraged foods have disappeared from our diets. Just like watercress, these ingredients might not have been much fun to base your diet on, but they can offer up a source of unusual flavours and textures, not to mention a rich source of vitamins and minerals, when there is little else homegrown around.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01eb61e9e7d89b9b2048fda4e6dab15e6f025def\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01eb61e9e7d89b9b2048fda4e6dab15e6f025def/0_183_5300_3180/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Not just edible, delicious: dandelions.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Not just edible, delicious: dandelions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nigel Hallett/Eyefine</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dandelions are not just edible but, if prepared correctly, can be positively delicious. In regional Italian and French cuisine, they are actively planted in vegetable gardens as a prized alternative to chicory, to which they are related. Mature leaves are wilted in hot oil with a few lardons and bring a rich bitter green taste to dishes such as risotto. However, if you fancy a milder flavour, simply cover the plants with an upturned bucket for a week or two before harvest. This excludes the light and results in longer, pale yellow leaves with only a hint of bitterness.</p> <p>Shepherd\u2019s purse is a relative of watercress and has a similar peppery flavour. While its summer leaves can be tough and fiery, its new flushes of spring growth rival the fanciest salad greens. Traditionally eaten everywhere from here to Japan, the leaves can be used in all the same dishes that watercress can.</p> <p>Finally, I know eating nettles might sound like some kind of bizarre punishment, but the tiny, venom-filled needles that cause them to sting are rendered harmless by a minute or two in a hot pan. Like shepherd\u2019s purse, its peak of deliciousness is right now, so don\u2019t wait around. It\u2019s like a richer, more complex-flavoured spinach, with no hint of bitterness. Trust me, I wouldn\u2019t don rubber gloves to pick them each year if they weren\u2019t genuinely worth the effort.</p> <p>So, there you have it, three delicious and nutritious crops that are often overlooked in our food culture, which will turn the drudgery of weeding into the joy of harvesting, just when your veg patch needs it the most.</p> <p><em>Follow James on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Botanygeek?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@Botanygeek</a></em></p>",
  "<p>The break in play caused by coronavirus might appear a curious time for the International Cricket Council to be reminding players of their duty to report corrupt approaches, but a sport that sits dormant is still vulnerable. The illegal gambling market on the Asian subcontinent has no live action at present and when play resumes there will be an appetite among bookmakers and punters to make up for lost time. What chance a spike in nefarious activity as a knock-on effect?</p> <p>This threat is something that anti-corruption units around the world are wary of, not least with cricketers, like many of us, on their mobile phones more than usual during the lockdown. The loss of lucrative deals, as tournaments are postponed, could make some more amenable to alternative sources of money, too.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/18/match-fixers-targeting-cricketers-lockdown-icc-warning\">Cricket match-fixers actively targeting players during lockdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cCorruptors will be losing income and they might see it as an opportunity to reach out to players,\u201d Hayley Green, anti-corruption manager at the England and Wales Cricket Board, told the Observer via conference call.</p> <p>\u201cThe longer the lockdown continues and certain tournaments don\u2019t take place, absolutely it will be going through their minds when and how to reach out to players. That\u2019s not just cricket, you might expect a trend across sport. We\u2019re planning for that.\u201d</p> <p>For players, officials and agents in England and Wales there are myriad ways to report suspicious contact, including a 24-hour hotline, six anti-corruption officers allocated to work with three counties each and an ICC Integrity mobile app.</p> <p>Under the ECB and ICC anti-corruption codes it is their duty to flag up potentially corrupt approaches too. In recent times two high-profile suspensions from cricket, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/29/bangladesh-captain-shakib-al-hasan-two-year-cricket-corruption-ban\">Bangladesh\u2019s superstar all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/26/sanath-jayasuriya-banned-corruption-investigation-cricket-two-years\">Sanath Jayasuriya, the former Sri Lanka opener turned national selector</a>, serve as a reminder of the consequences for not doing so.</p> <p>That both bans were triggered by failure to report, as well as a refusal to cooperate in the case of Jayasuriya, is noteworthy. Since Alex Marshall, the former British chief constable, took charge of the ICC\u2019s anti-corruption unit in 2017, there has been a clear shift towards this side of the problem, as well as increased efforts to disrupt corruptors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"39e64e8b73cf6432daa41acb1cd8918d1e46adfc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39e64e8b73cf6432daa41acb1cd8918d1e46adfc/0_269_4107_2464/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shakib Al Hasan is serving a two-year ban for failing to report corrupt approaches\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shakib Al Hasan is serving a two-year ban for failing to report corrupt approaches</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Munir Uz Zaman/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It makes sense, too. Demonstrating definitively that games or passages of play are fixed remains labyrinthine work, even if there has been recent successes in exposing schemes in the Pakistan Super League (2017) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/25/gulam-bodi-banned-20-years-ram-slam\">South Africa\u2019s Ram Slam T20 (2016)</a>.</p> <p>But now armed with the technology to trace communications \u2013 to the point that even the information on a deliberately damaged sim card can be recovered \u2013 it has become easier for investigators to prove an approach has not been escalated, so we are seeing the bans this commands \u2013 six months to five years \u2013 being dispensed more regularly.</p> <p>James Pyemont, the ECB\u2019s head of integrity, says: \u201cThat offence [failure to report] is a standalone one but it is also a way of trying to identify and catch corruption early. There are many reasons why that\u2019s a sensible approach. From a historical look at match-fixing in cricket, there are always opportunities for intervention and prevention before that corrupt event happens, so it\u2019s working in that space and seeking to be proactive rather than reactive.\u201d</p> <p>The ECB is understood to have seen the number of approaches being reported roughly double in the past two years. The figures, not disclosed, are said to remain relatively low overall, however, and the increase is not necessarily viewed as a sign of more activity.</p> <p>Rather they say the feedback from the Professional Cricketers\u2019 Association is that trust in the process has gone up, as well as awareness given education programmes that include seminars, online modules and contact with their local anti-corruption officer.</p> <p>English cricket is taking a more bespoke approach, too, recognising that different players require different messaging at different times, be it the academy graduate starting their career or the seasoned pro heading off to play in a domestic Twenty20 competition overseas.</p> <p>The T20 leagues have opened up new commercial opportunities but also a fresh avenue for fixers. As well as lavish gifts and fictional sponsorship deals, a new method of approach is to promise a player they will be signed in a draft. The ECB says it will happily investigate any offers that feel remotely suspicious, even if simply to provide peace of mind.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pyemont adds: \u201cWe are trying to work in the background and it\u2019s a balance of how much headspace we can occupy with players. We don\u2019t want them to be paranoid but we also want them to recognise if something is not right and pass that headache on to us. We want to be a drum beat in the back of their minds.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s also very clear that if they make a mistake in this area, it can be very difficult to come back from. So we want to work in support but there are severe consequences that can be career changing or even life changing.\u201d</p> <p>In short, there has never been an easier time for players to report an approach, nor a more punitive time if they don\u2019t. The sport is on hold but the drum continues to beat.</p>",
  "<p>Since the beginning of France\u2019s total lockdown on 17 March, the weather has been unusually and brilliantly sunny in Paris. But well into our fifth week of confinement, we are only allowed to go out with a dated <a href=\"https://media.interieur.gouv.fr/deplacement-covid-19/\">permission slip</a> and to travel within a 1km radius of our home, once a day, and for a maximum of one hour.

Cutting through the centre of the circuit to get to its outer edge, I pass a woman I\u2019ve seen several times, who dresses in black and feeds the crows. I\u2019m heading to rue de Mouza\u00efa, which is named after a mountain pass in Algeria that was the site of a battle between French and Algerian troops in 1840.

The entire neighbourhood is built on gypsum quarries, which produced high-quality plaster for export to North America \u2013 hence its nickname of <em>le quartier de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique</em>. My favourite house is a lemon-yellow one on the corner of a lane called Villa Sadi Carnot: it has a palm tree in the garden and buds on the wisteria are about to unfurl.</p> <p>I turn right and walk to the empty <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Place+de+Rhin+et+Danube,+75019+Paris/@48.881922,2.3909017,17z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x47e66db8ecba43bf:0x20c49f60247d9be9!2sPlace+de+Rhin+et+Danube,+75019+Paris!3b1!8m2!3d48.881922!4d2.3930904!3m4!1s0x47e66db8ecba43bf:0x20c49f60247d9be9!8m2!3d48.881922!4d2.3930904\">Place du Rhin et Danube</a>, where in the late 19th century a horse and fodder market was held.

  "<p>The pop star Anne-Marie has squirrelled herself away in an alcove, in a corner of a caf\u00e9 in south London. It is the middle of February, and she has been working in a studio around the corner, on her second album, and now she\u2019s picking at a veggie breakfast, though it\u2019s three in the afternoon. Her formerly blonde, newly pale-pink hair lights her up like a beacon, but I have arrived a little early, and she looks so quiet and self-contained, so tucked into herself and thoughtful, that I have a strong urge to turn around and leave her to it. I had heard she was a talker, expected the gregarious character that is larger-than-life in her videos, but my first impressions are that perhaps she won\u2019t be much of a talker at all.</p> <p>Within two minutes of sitting down, I know this about the woman born Anne-Marie Rose Nicholson: the name of her nephew, where she lives, where she grew up, why she\u2019s baffled that her Wikipedia says her dad is Irish (he\u2019s from east London), the results of a DNA test she did to find out her ancestry and the fact that she wrote a whole album that she decided to scrap, because she realised that what she\u2019d come up with was too \u201cratchet\u201d. The idea was, she explains, that it would be a reversal of the wronged woman situation she had picked apart on her debut album, <em>Speak Your Mind</em>. She started writing about being the cheater, rather than the cheated-on. \u201cI feel like in the first album, I had struggles, and I was trying to get through that by writing them down, and then when I came to write the second album, I was like, yeah, I feel fucking great. I feel great in myself, I feel confident, so the whole album was really\u2026\u201d She starts laughing. \u201cIt was too much! It was so horrible. I was like, I don\u2019t care, I want to be different now, and then it wasn\u2019t until I did a show somewhere and this dad came over to me and said, \u2018I just want to say, I\u2019m so happy that my daughter listens to you because you\u2019re a really great [role model],\u2019 and I was like\u2026\u201d She clicks her fingers and grins. \u201cI\u2019m not releasing that album!\u201d</p> <p>So, Anne-Marie is a talker, after all. She is three percent Irish, five percent Scottish, a little bit Scandinavian, and as for the rest, \u201cI\u2019m just Essex, basically,\u201d she laughs.</p> <p>Breakfast over, she talks and talks, and she is open and unfiltered. At one point I ask her if she ever feels the need to keep anything back for herself. \u201cI haven\u2019t thought about that,\u201d she says, surprised it might be an option. \u201cI think the reason I\u2019ve been able to even carry on doing this career is because I am so honest and I want people to know who I am. That\u2019s been a great thing for me, rather than, you know, acting like someone else.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bdb954811e97e4a4ca93b0ad75fb3279c393c96f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bdb954811e97e4a4ca93b0ad75fb3279c393c96f/0_0_3805_4925/773.jpg\" alt=\"Anne-Marie in an oversized pink trouser suit and white blouse with masses of green satin on the floor and as a curtain behind her\" width=\"773\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u201cThe moment I started to write songs I was being myself\u2019: Anne-Marie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hayley Louisa Brown/Atlantic Records</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the age of five, Anne-Marie went to a dance school, which sent her to auditions and for a while she had a part in <em>Les Mis\u00e9rables</em> in the West End. Then she switched focus and became a teenage international karate champion before going back to music, taking up songwriting, and ending up as one of Britain\u2019s biggest pop stars. <em>Speak Your Mind</em> was the biggest debut album of 2018.</p> <p>When we meet, she is a month shy of turning 29, and has just released the single Birthday, currently clocking 16m views on YouTube. It\u2019s an arms-in-the-air, get-your-mates-on-the-dancefloor smash about celebration, even if you\u2019re broke, feel sad and thoughts of your ex are hanging around like a pungent aftershave. Her everywoman candour and knock-you-down vocal range have combined into a formula that she has spun into pop gold.</p> <p>She is working away at the new album, version two, with a confidence that had previously eluded her. She has struggled to write songs because of her self-doubt and, even now, when she\u2019s in the studio with people she has written with before, \u201cI almost feel like they don\u2019t believe in me.\u201d She is starting to realise that it\u2019s self-sabotage \u2013 all imagined. \u201cIt\u2019s actually me in my own brain.\u201d She has suffered with anxiety for a long time, has always been a people-pleaser and admits she longs to be liked. \u201cWhat I want to do in life is make people happy. Every day I wake up and say, \u2018I\u2019m going to make people smile.\u2019\u201d Along the way, she neglected to work out how to please herself.</p> <p>Anne-Marie started working on her own music when she was a teenager. \u201cI didn\u2019t spend time downstairs with my family. It was: in my room, put the CDs on, film myself singing, get better at singing, do that bit again. I think the passion for that overcame the bad bits.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dcb6ee56b3db21b13eb28f82ffb7edc4ccbcc7ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dcb6ee56b3db21b13eb28f82ffb7edc4ccbcc7ed/0_496_4033_2420/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anne-Marie on stage with Rudimental\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the spotlight: on stage with Rudimental.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Isaac/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her first hint of the spotlight arrived in 2014, when Rudimental took her on tour as a vocalist, and she sang with the band for two years. When her own music started to pick up speed, she toured with her friend Ed Sheeran, and did vocals on Clean Bandit\u2019s Rockabye, which became the Christmas No 1 in 2016. When her debut album took off, in 2018, she turned out snappy platinum hit after hit.</p> <p>As she became more successful, her anxiety grew. \u201cIt got worse when I became an artist. I was like, \u2018Great,\u2019\u201d she says, dryly. \u201cIt got overwhelming.\u201d She describes how it manifested as \u201cjust, preventing things that were easy. Little things, like going into a room full of people, I wouldn\u2019t be able to do that. I\u2019d have to get people to go in first, so everyone would look at them, then I could go in second.\u201d</p> <p>It was an exhausting period, not just because of her workload. \u201cI just thought I was a weirdo. I didn\u2019t understand myself. Then I found out it was anxiety, and I felt better as soon as I said it, as other people could understand.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Ed Sheeran gave me one piece of advice: \u2018Call your parents every day\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She traces it back to having a tough time in her teens. \u201cI think I really started to struggle when I was in Year 8 or 9, and that just came down to me being a prick, to be honest. I became a horrible teenager, the worst kid you can have as a parent.\u201d Even now, she feels the need to keep apologising to her parents for how angry she was, and how much she took it out on them. \u201cMy nan passed away when I was 12 and I think that affected me really badly.\u201d They had been close. \u201cShe held us all together.\u201d</p> <p>There was another catastrophe, a far more teenage one but a significant one, nonetheless. When she started secondary school, she\u2019d been popular. \u201cAnd I loved it! I was going out with all the boys, and one would come up to me and say, \u2018I want to go out with you,\u2019 and I\u2019d be like, \u2018All right, I\u2019ll dump him and go out with you.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t until I was with someone for a long time\u2026\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a pause. \u201cYep. I cheated on him with another boy and that changed everything. From then, everyone hated me.\u201d Her friends stopped speaking to her, overnight. It seems so insignificant now, she admits. \u201cBut at the time, it was massive. I never told my family anything about it, because it\u2019s almost embarrassing that people don\u2019t like you. I\u2019d go home and pretend I\u2019d had a good day.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7594b1b3504aa128eda8badd65676e8b00b549e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7594b1b3504aa128eda8badd65676e8b00b549e4/0_162_1080_647/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anne Marie with Ed Sheeran on a plane\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flying high: with Ed Sheeran.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @annemarie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sometimes girls would talk to her out of school, then at school they would blank her, which left her with long-standing trust issues. \u201cHonestly, until I had hypnotherapy, I had struggled with everyone I\u2019d met, even the people in the label. They\u2019d be like, \u2018We\u2019re on your side, we want the best for you.\u2019 I was like: \u2018Fuck off, you don\u2019t!\u2019\u201d It sounds as if she was bullied. \u201cWell, do you know what? At one point I guess it was that. But I also think I was a really sensitive person. I find it hard saying that word, \u2018bullying\u2019, because in the end, I feel bad for the people I\u2019m calling a bully.\u201d</p> <p>Anne-Marie is close to her family; she recently moved back to Essex from London, just to be nearer to them. When she\u2019s away on tour, she calls her mum and dad all the time, a trick she picked up from Ed Sheeran. She asked him for the one crucial piece of advice that he\u2019d give to someone new to the music industry. \u201cHe said, \u2018Call your mum and dad every day.\u2019\u201d Otherwise, she explains, they only see what everyone else sees. \u201cAnd you want them to know everything else.\u201d Her dad is a builder and handyman, and her mum a teacher \u2013 they\u2019ve been together since they were teenagers, which has given Anne-Marie an idealised view of love.</p> <p>\u201cI thought that was what everyone was like,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI thought the first person I was with, that\u2019s my husband. It made me intense! So the boys were like, \u2018<em>Eurgh</em>, get away, we just want to have fun!\u2019\u201d She always wanted to get married, but now she\u2019s older, and has seen a few friends\u2019 relationships break down, she\u2019s not so sure. \u201cIt just opened my eyes. Now I\u2019m completely the other side. I\u2019m not bothered.\u201d</p> <p>That disappointment in a romantic ideal comes out again and again in her songs. \u201cI felt like the moment I started to write songs, even if they were really shit, I was being myself, and that\u2019s what I loved about songwriting.\u201d But even when <em>Speak Your Mind</em> got as big as it did, she questioned her abilities. \u201cWhen I first started writing, I couldn\u2019t write, so I think I never grew out of that. It\u2019s like when I lost weight, I never really grew out of thinking that I was still the chubby Anne-Marie, you know what I mean?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"854080e808b84cf3674825b84633c436e28b1ab8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/854080e808b84cf3674825b84633c436e28b1ab8/0_111_1080_648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anne Marie as a child\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bright eyed: as a little girl.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @annemarie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She was 19 when she started feeling \u201cchubby\u201d, she says. \u201cI just ate loads. It wasn\u2019t until a year later and I saw one of my exes at a pub, and he was like: \u2018You\u2019re looking healthy\u2019.\u201d He made me look at myself, and then I went the complete opposite direction and had a problem with eating.\u201d Now, she is much more sanguine, at least when it comes to her body. \u201cI just decided, do you know what? I\u2019m just going to see what my body is supposed to be, go to the gym, feel healthy and whatever the shape my body comes out, that\u2019s just what I\u2019m supposed to be.\u201d</p> <p>There was another change, too. After her career had taken off, she started to question why she never felt present, in the moment. \u201cI just felt like I wasn\u2019t actually here,\u201d she says, trying to explain it. She was so unsettled by the sensation that she went online to see whether she might be having a breakdown. There was an interview she did in Australia, at 27, when she was told everything changes when you get to 28. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt I was 20,\u201d she explains. \u201cI felt I was growing up, but not actually growing up. Then when I became 28, I was like, oh shit, I\u2019m 28!\u201d She laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it was what she said that made it go into my brain, or if it actually is a thing that when you\u2019re 28, you change, but I was sitting in my living room one day, and I just cried my eyes out.\u201d</p> <p>At the beginning of April, I give Anne-Marie a call to see how she\u2019s coping with lockdown: \u201cI\u2019m a bit of a germ freak anyway, so it\u2019s heightened everything,\u201d she says, from her bedroom at home. She tells me she\u2019s been on tour or working for seven years, so this is the longest she has been in one place for ages. \u201cI honestly have never been so close to my friends and family at this point. We started on Houseparty and we have a schedule of what we do every day. On Monday, we have bingo. On Tuesday, we have a DJ night, so one of us plays music. Wednesday is quiz night. Thursday is Fitness Thursdays. Friday is Teach-Me Friday. Then Saturday is Quarantine\u2019s Got Talent. So we\u2019ve got a whole schedule.\u201d</p> <p>As well as enjoying having more time to herself, she\u2019s still feeling the benefits of the hypnotherapy she had. \u201cAfter it, I thought, how the hell had I been making other people happy, when I wasn\u2019t?\u201d she says. She\u2019s still a people-pleaser, but now she feels better about that, too. \u201cI know how good it feels to feel good,\u201d she explains, happy, for now, in the moment.</p> <p><em>Anne-Marie\u2019s single, Birthday, is out on Asylum/Major Toms</em></p>",
