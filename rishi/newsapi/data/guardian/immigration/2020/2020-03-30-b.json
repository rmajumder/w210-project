As two surgeons became the first doctors to die from the disease in Britain, staff lobby groups attacked continuing shortages of gear such as masks and gowns and there were further calls for increased testing of workers.

magnets stuck up nose while inventing coronavirus device</h2> \n  <p>An Australian astrophysicist has been admitted to hospital after getting four magnets stuck up his nose in an attempt to invent a device that stops people touching their faces during the coronavirus outbreak.<br></p> \n  <p>Dr Daniel Reardon, a research fellow at Melbourne\u2019s Swinburne University, was building a necklace that sounds an alarm on facial contact, when the mishap occurred on Thursday night.</p> \n  <p>The 27 year-old astrophysicist, who studies pulsars and gravitational waves, said he was trying to liven up the boredom of self-isolation with the four powerful neodymium magnets.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI have some electronic equipment but really no experience or expertise in building circuits or things,\u201d he told Guardian Australia.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI had a part that detects magnetic fields. I thought that if I built a circuit that could detect the magnetic field, and we wore magnets on our wrists, then it could set off an alarm if you brought it too close to your face. A bit of boredom in isolation made me think of that.\u201d</p> \n  <p>However, the academic realised the electronic part he had did the opposite \u2013 and would only complete a circuit when there was no magnetic field present.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI accidentally invented a necklace that buzzes continuously unless you move your hand close to your face,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAfter scrapping that idea, I was still a bit bored, playing with the magnets. It\u2019s the same logic as clipping pegs to your ears \u2013 I clipped them to my earlobes and then clipped them to my nostril and things went downhill pretty quickly when I clipped the magnets to my other nostril.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Reardon said he placed two magnets inside his nostrils, and two on the outside. When he removed the magnets from the outside of his nose, the two inside stuck together. Unfortunately, the researcher then attempted to use his remaining magnets to remove them.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/30/astrophysicist-gets-magnets-stuck-up-nose-while-inventing-coronavirus-device\">Astrophysicist gets magnets stuck up nose while inventing coronavirus device</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8166818f08af215f6fdc69\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/helen-davidson\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-30T05:15:18.033Z\">6.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Senior WHO adviser appears to dodge question on Taiwan\u2019s Covid-19 response</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A senior advisor at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">World Health Organization</a> (WHO) appeared to hang up on a journalist who asked about Taiwan\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic, and then did not answer further questions because they had \u201calready talked about China\u201d.</p> \n  <p>It comes amid continued criticism of the WHO\u2019s approach towards both Taiwan and China.

The large number of people involved in EU-UK post-Brexit talks makes video-conferencing a complicated option, although more manageable for Monday\u2019s smaller group involved in implementing the withdrawal agreement.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-30T11:14:22.352Z\">at 12.14pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e81c9808f08af215f6fdf4c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-30T10:34:26.024Z\">11.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/f1-team-helps-build-new-uk-breathing-aid-for-covid-19-patients\">breathing aid that can help keep coronavirus patients out of intensive care</a> units has been developed by mechanical engineers, medics and the Mercedes Formula One team.</p> \n  <p>The continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device was created in under a week and has been used in hospitals in Italy and China to help patients.</p> \n  <p>It bridges the gap between an oxygen mask and the need for full ventilation. </p> \n  <p>A team from University College London and University College London Hospital worked with Mercedes Formula One team to adapt and improve existing CPAP. </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/f1-team-helps-build-new-uk-breathing-aid-for-covid-19-patients\">F1 team helps build new UK breathing aid for Covid-19 patients</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e81c8868f08af215f6fdf2f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-30T10:24:38.107Z\">11.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Royal College of Nursing has said it is \u201cunacceptable\u201d that some staff are treating patients without personal protective equipment (PPE).</p> \n  <p>Dame Donna Kinnair, chief executive and general secretary of the body, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The Government is finally prioritising Covid-19 testing for NHS staff, including social care, but it is completely unacceptable that weeks into this crisis there are colleagues in all settings - hospitals, community or care homes - who have not been provided with personal protective equipment.</p> \n   <p>I am hearing from nurses who are treating patients in Covid-19 wards without any protection at all.

  "<p>The seasonal flu tends to dissipate during the summer, leading some to hope the coronavirus will do the same. Experts explain why transmission of some illnesses lowers with warmer temperatures \u2013 and warn against lowering our guard.</p> \n<h2><strong>Why are some viruses seasonal?</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Dr</strong><strong> Marc Lipsitch: </strong>What makes seasonal viruses seasonal is a combination of opportunities for transmission \u2013 whether school is in term, which facilitates transmission \u2013 and what proportion of the population is immune, combined with weather.</p> \n<p>Humidity is lower in the winter, which is good for transmission. Low humidity makes [virus-carrying] droplets settle more slowly because they shrink to smaller sizes and then friction keeps them in the air, whereas high humidity doesn\u2019t do that.</p> \n<p><strong>Dr</strong><strong> Lee W</strong><strong> Riley</strong>: People still get the common cold [in the summer] and we\u2019re beginning to see this new coronavirus in the southern hemisphere. It\u2019s more about the way people behave.</p> \n<h2><strong>Can we expect the number of Covid-19 cases to fall this summer?</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Lipsitch: </strong>Based on our best estimates from other coronaviruses, summer alone is not going to bring transmission to a level where the number of cases shrinks. It\u2019s just going to grow more slowly.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s really clear that warmer weather does not stop the transmission or growth of the virus. That\u2019s clear from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/datablog/ng-interactive/2020/mar/30/coronavirus-cases-in-australia-map-confirmed-numbers-stats-how-many-cases-of-covid-19-nsw-maps-victoria-live-data-qld-sa-wa-tas-nt-latest-statistics-update\">Australia</a>, Singapore and Hong Kong. Singapore and Hong Kong have kept it to a large degree under control, but that\u2019s with incredibly intense control measures. There\u2019s no question that coronaviruses are capable of transmitting in hotter, humid climates.</p> \n<p><strong>Dr</strong><strong> George Rutherford: </strong>Thinking that it\u2019s magically going to go away in April or May or whenever is just that \u2013 magical thinking. The projections show quite a bit of transmission out through the summer.</p> \n<p><strong>Riley: </strong>It\u2019s a completely new virus, so it\u2019s really hard to know what would happen. If you try to extrapolate from [related] viruses, then we don\u2019t expect for this new coronavirus to completely disappear by the summer.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Could there be a second wave of infections in the autumn?</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Riley: </strong>A reintroduction of the epidemic is certainly possible; it\u2019s beginning to happen in Hong Kong. Hong Kong successfully controlled the epidemic early on, and they started relaxing some of their restrictions. Now they\u2019re beginning to see new cases reappear.</p> \n<p><strong>Rutherford: </strong>In 2009, we saw a second wave of the swine flu. It started in the spring in Mexico. Some schools in the United States got out early for the summer, and when [students] went back in the fall, it came back in a bump. That [outbreak] was blunted because a vaccine came out that fall. That\u2019s not going to happen here. We\u2019re going to have to temporize until a vaccine arrives.</p> \n<p><strong>Lipsitch: </strong>If we let up on social distancing before a large fraction of the population is immune, there could be a second peak of infections in the fall, when it\u2019s most contagious, due to school being back in session and cooler temperatures. And that would be the worst possible outcome.</p> \n<h2><strong>Will we need to resume social distancing in the fall?</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Lipsitch:</strong> If our strategy is to use social distancing as our main control measure because we haven\u2019t figured out anything better, then the best way to do it is to distance until we bring cases down to low enough levels that we can let transmission resume by relaxing social distancing, and have several weeks or months where we don\u2019t overwhelm the healthcare system.</p> \n<p>And then we distance again, and repeat the cycle. With each cycle, we\u2019ll get more time off social distancing, because the buildup of immunity in the population helps to slow the spread. So you don\u2019t get to the dangerous peak as quickly.</p> \n<p>That [scenario] will be destructive to the economy, to education, and all sorts of things. But as a means of trying to preserve the healthcare system, if we don\u2019t have another approach, it may be our best option.</p> \n<p>I want to be clear: as an epidemiologist, I\u2019m saying what I think existing tools make possible for the purposes of disease control, and not what I think is socially desirable. Multiple rounds of social distancing are not something I look forward to.</p> \n<p><strong>Riley: </strong>It\u2019s conceivable that we may have to do another round of lockdowns, but we need to look even further ahead. What\u2019s going to happen next year? Is it going to come back again like the influenza? Is a new type of coronavirus going to come back? Maybe not next year, but maybe, two years from now? This is not the only time we\u2019re going to be doing these lockdowns.</p> \n<h2><strong>Is there another approach we could take?</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Rutherford: </strong>I think as shelter in place starts to get peeled back, it\u2019s going to need to be replaced with something more along the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/south-korea-rapid-intrusive-measures-covid-19\">South Korean model</a> of aggressive contact tracing, quarantine and isolation, and that\u2019s going to be the bridge to get us out to when the vaccine comes in. Given the hit on the economy that\u2019s going on now, there\u2019s going to be a lot of enthusiasm for the South Korean model.</p> \n<p><strong>Lipsitch: </strong>If we can do that, it\u2019s great. The challenge is that reintroductions are a constant threat. We\u2019ve seen it in China. They\u2019re trying to go back to work while doing control based on individual cases, but they\u2019ve had multiple introductions from outside the country now. I think it\u2019s what we should aim for, but I\u2019m not hugely optimistic that it will work.</p> \n<p><strong>Riley: </strong>South Korea and Hong Kong had really efficient contact tracing programs, where they would quarantine the contacts of symptomatic people who were diagnosed with coronavirus. It was a much more focused approach to controlling transmission.</p> \n<p>The problem in the US is we don\u2019t have that kind of manpower, and that\u2019s probably something that the US really needs to start looking into in a very serious way, because we just totally neglected our public health system infrastructure.</p> \n<p><strong>Panel:</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Dr Marc Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology and director, Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health</p></li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Dr Lee W Riley, professor and chair of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology, UC\u2013Berkeley School of Public Health</p></li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Dr George Rutherford, professor of epidemiology and biostatistics, director, Prevention and Public Health Group, UCSF</p></li> \n</ul>",

  "<p>It was long said to have been the most significant decision of Angela Merkel\u2019s 14 years as German chancellor. Now the political and social drama of the refugee crisis in 2015 has been turned into a feature film based on a bestselling book.</p> <p>Merkel: The Driven charts the twists and turns surrounding the decree that allowed almost a million refugees into Germany.</p> <p>The film culminates in her resolve, despite opposition from many of her political friends and foes, not to close Germany\u2019s borders after<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/05/refugees-travelling-from-hungary-can-enter-germany-and-austria\"> thousands of refugees, mainly from Syria, boarded trains at Budapest\u2019s Keleti station and headed for Germany</a>, after the police who had been stopping them from leaving were withdrawn.</p> <p>The film\u2019s director, Stephan Wagner, said the film was as much a political thriller as it was \u201ca portrait of Merkel, focusing on a turning point in her time in office\u201d.</p> <p>It is based on Robin Alexander\u2019s 2017 bestseller <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/06/germany-devours-book-on-angela-merkel-decision-to-open-borders\">The Driven Ones: </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/06/germany-devours-book-on-angela-merkel-decision-to-open-borders\">Merkel and Refugee </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/06/germany-devours-book-on-angela-merkel-decision-to-open-borders\">Policy</a>, in which the long-time political correspondent for Die Welt offered a behind-the-scenes account of the 63 days of political intrigue and back-biting that changed modern Germany.</p> <p>It shows Merkel sticking doggedly to the idea of a political solution before dividing opinion among both her opponents and party colleagues with her decision not to close Germany\u2019s borders. She calls her stance as a \u201chumanitarian imperative\u201d, but the film portrays it in much more ambiguous terms, suggesting Merkel was reluctant to be seen as the \u201crefugee chancellor\u201d.</p> <p>Imogen Kogge, who plays Merkel in the film, well-known to German viewers as police commissioner Johanna Herz in the popular series <em>Polizeiruf 110</em>, said the film threw light on the complexities of communication, \u201con how communication occurs on the highest level when there is quite simply a lack of solutions\u201d.</p> <p>She said that playing one of the most famous women in the world had not been straightforward: \u201cThat everyone inside and outside of Germany believes they know Merkel well did not make it particularly easy to approach the role. But once I was assured it was not about impersonating her, but in the first instance to find certain recognisable characteristics, I felt relatively free.\u201d</p> <p>The drama starts with Germany stuck in the middle of the Greek debt crisis, when Merkel\u2019s finance minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/wolfgang-schauble\">Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2015/may/11/greece-make-or-break-talks-interesting-sub-plot-emerges-\">is pushing for a \u201cGrexit\u201d</a>, the expulsion of Greece from the eurozone, against Merkel\u2019s will. She is then abruptly informed that Hungary intends to build a border fence to stop the refugees from war-torn Syria entering the country and a whole new crisis starts to unfold.</p> <p>It is shaped by Merkel\u2019s attempts to push the issue away and put off any concrete decision-making, as well as the increasing divide between those Germans who want the country to welcome refugees and those who angrily reject the idea. The resulting tension continues to define German politics today.</p> <p>The film was set for a German cinema release at the weekend but will now be shown by the state broadcaster ARD on 15 April due to the coronavirus crisis \u2013 which, unlike in 2015, did lead Merkel to close the borders.</p> <p>\u201cThe events of 2015 continue to shape German politics very much to this day,\u201d the producer, Alexander van D\u00fcllman, said. \u201cAs Germany prepares to bid farewell to Angela Merkel the refugee question still remains a very fragile one.\u201d </p>",

She\u2019s concerned for those who are too scared to seek medical help because they live in a country where hostility courses through the veins of our basic services. These are some of the people charities now warn are at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/million-undocumented-migrants-could-go-hungry-say-charities\">high risk</a> not only of contracting Covid-19, but of starvation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/councils-told-to-house-all-rough-sleepers-in-england-by-weekend\">Councils told to house all rough sleepers in England by weekend</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After decades of racist, dehumanising rhetoric and policies that deny migrants basic rights, they seem to be some of the people lowest on the list of concerns in the Covid-19 response.

Like cleaners, care workers, supermarket staff and delivery drivers \u2013 many of whom are migrants \u2013 NHS workers are risking their lives to keep us safe. These are the \u201ckey workers\u201d the government just last month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/19/immigration-proposal-english-language\">dismissed as \u201clow-skilled\u201d</a>.</p> <p>In this moment of crisis, the government has so far either offered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/councils-told-to-house-all-rough-sleepers-in-england-by-weekend\">piecemeal measures</a> for migrants, or done nothing. Now a group of organisations is <a href=\"https://www.jcwi.org.uk/protecting-migrants-from-covid-19\">asking</a> why the government hasn\u2019t suspended the hostile environment and NRPF (\u201cno recourse to public funds\u201d. Introduced under New Labour and tightened under the coalition government, NRPF is a condition attached to certain immigration statuses that <a href=\"https://www.freemovement.org.uk/what-is-the-no-recourse-to-public-funds-condition/\">bars migrants</a> from accessing state support. For Paige\u2019s husband, a self-employed builder from Albania, it might mean he won\u2019t qualify for state support to cover any loss of income during the pandemic. So far she says it\u2019s been \u201call silence\u201d from the government on this issue. </p> <p>Jane is similarly worried. As a freelancer in the creative industry, her work vanished in a seven-day period. NRPF means she can\u2019t apply for universal credit, get support from her local council or, it seems, claim as someone who\u2019s self-employed. \u201cI don\u2019t think the government understands how little of a safety net migrants, and most of society, functions on day-to-day,\u201d she says.</p> <p>It is moments like these that expose the true impact of anti-immigration policies. As we\u2019re all being told to \u201cstay at home\u201d, asylum seekers are forced to use <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/coronavirus-asylum-seekers-urban-house-a9430991.html\">cramped communal eating spaces</a> and <a href=\"http://www.irr.org.uk/news/asylum-in-the-time-of-covid-19/\">live in damp, dirty accommodation</a>, and migrants are worrying about how they\u2019ll feed themselves. The virus might not care about immigration status, but government policy still can.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.freemovement.org.uk/coronavirus/\">Significant parts of immigration</a> enforcement have <a href=\"https://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/latest/news/changes-to-home-office-asylum-resettlement-policy-and-practice-in-response-to-covid-19/\">been suspended</a>, such as screening interviews and evictions, but even some of those changes are riddled with gaps and confusion. Immigration barrister Colin Yeo tells me that one way the government could improve things would be to establish a firewall between the NHS and the Home Office. Under the hostile environment, doctors are required to act as immigration enforcers, so a lot of people still worry their data will be passed on. When you inject fear into the system, don\u2019t be surprised if it shows up in times of crisis.</p> <p>Keeping track of all the announcements is difficult; making sense of them is just as hard. In a <a href=\"https://www.jcwi.org.uk/covid-19-briefing-to-the-home-affairs-select-committee\">long list</a> of suggested changes to the Home Office\u2019s procedures, <a href=\"https://www.jcwi.org.uk/\">the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants</a> issued a stark warning: \u201cUnless the emergency measures are simple, they will fail.\u201d Clarity has not been forthcoming.

The logic that underpinned this thinking is the problem. People\u2019s rights, their access to healthcare, their ability to survive \u2013 none of this should be determined by how much they earn, their perceived skills or their immigration status. This is as true now as it will be when the pandemic is over.

What if her four children, including her eight-year-old disabled son, Sumit, heavy in her arms, died here on the side of the road?</p> \n<p>\u201cThe road seemed endless, we had no money for food and my children just took short breaks sleeping on the ground,\u201d she said.

Shops, factories and restaurants would all be shut and people would be confined to their homes for all but essential activities.</p> \n<p>While it was met with approval by experts and health professionals, the lockdown has already proved catastrophic for India\u2019s millions of migrant and daily wage workers, who earn their salary hundreds or sometimes thousands of miles away from home and live a hand-to-mouth existence.</p> \n<p>With no way to earn money and feed their families for at least three weeks, millions decided last week to head back to their villages in order to survive.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"4af07576-d7aa-4d4c-98dc-13da3ec13aef\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RnTfvrhJs88?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>With trains and most buses suspended and taxis unaffordable, walking was the only option for many, and the sides of the highways were soon lined with people, bags slung over their shoulders, many with nothing but flip-flops on their feet.

In a bid to stop people moving, on Sunday night the government ordered all state borders to be closed, and police began arresting those walking on the highways or who reached state borders on foot.

By 1999 low paid women could expect to live to 77.1 while their professional colleagues could enjoy another 5.7 years.</p> <p>This punitive inequality in death is a measure of social injustice that should spur all political parties to tackle the poverty that lies behind it.

The health select committee estimated in 2002 that the direct cost of obesity to the NHS was between \u00a3990m and \u00a31,225m; the direct cost of mental illness rose from \u00a3965m in 1983-84 to \u00a35bn in 2003-04. One of the causes of the rise in mental illness, it has been found by the Institute for Brain Chemistry and Human Nutrition, is poor maternal nutrition before and after conception. It substantially increases the risk of low birthweight and developmental brain disorder. The incidence of low birthweight in the UK has risen from 6.6% in 1953 to 7.6% in 2003 - the highest rate of low birthweight in Europe.

As a citizen who pays income and council tax, VAT and the excise duty on my evening glass of wine, I steam with indignation each time I am used by ministers to justify such draconian measures making people poorer.</p> <p>I am glad my taxation is used to enable my fellow citizens, both in and out of work, to buy enough food, clothes, fuel, transport and other necessities, to pay council tax and the rent of secure homes, when they have no other means to do so; and bewildered by the short-sightedness of a policy which deliberately reduces the totally inadequate adult JSA of \u00a367.50 a week by creating rent arrears, with debt-related mental health problems and high extra costs for a hard-pressed NHS.</p> <p>The self-evident unfairness is the current policy of dumping national debt and deficit reduction on the incomes of the squeezed middle and poorest citizens, while the higher-paid taxpayers experience no financial inconvenience. <a href=\"http://oecdinsights.org/2012/01/20/the-government-inspectors/\">Meanwhile the OECD reports that $11.5 trillion</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5925f75c-03cf-11e0-8c3f-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1mv83XZQe\">including bonuses</a>, is parked in overseas accounts and the Treasury is aware that <a href=\"http://www.londonlovesbusiness.com/100bn-of-central-london-properties-held-in-offshore-tax-havens/1545.article\">\u00a3100bn of property in central London alone is registered overseas</a> \u2013 both out of reach of the taxman. That really is unfair. I hope thousands will join Taxpayers Against Poverty, TAP, to say so loud and clear.

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/01/haringey-council-claire-kober-momentum-residents\" title=\"\">Haringey housing battle</a> was about the people\u2019s opposition to the powerful state and a powerful private developer joining forces to remove the land from under the homes of council tenants. Since 1979 an ideological free market approach to land has been forcing the UK back to the middle ages.</p> <p>In the history of the parish of Fingest, which I served, is the story of Henry Burgersh. He was the grandson of a baron who became bishop of Lincoln; he claimed authority over the abbot of St Albans Abbey. In March 1130 the abbot made over to the bishop the manor of Fingest (Buckinghamshire) in return for a renunciation of all episcopal rights over the monastery. The bishop promptly enclosed 300 acres of common land on which 60 families depended for survival; it is recorded that they starved. The modern version is in the unlimited, unearned, untaxed increase in the value of land grabbed for private gain to the detriment of the common good.<br><strong>Rev Paul

Journal, 22 February). Throughout the UK, truly affordable council housing was built on public land. The price of borrowing to build and maintain council estates and their communities was recovered over, say, 50 years by low earners paying low rents, which did not include the ever-increasing value of land. Councils are now using the high value of public land to finance developers to demolish council estates and build private housing, which council tenants cannot afford. Hence the <a href=\"https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN02110\" title=\"\">79% increase</a> in homeless families in England to 86,000, including 127,000 children since 2010, some for up to and over 10 years, 1.1 million households on council waiting lists and 4,700 single adults sleeping rough each night.</p> <p>The New Economics Foundation recently reported that the government sold enough public land for developers to build 131,000 homes, but only 2.6% will be for social rent. There is an urgent need for legislation that forbids the sale of public land and requires it to be used for affordable social housing.<br><strong>Rev Paul Nicolson</strong><br><em>Taxpayers Against Poverty</em></p>",
  "<p>For absolutely no good reason, I\u2019ve decide that the theme of my quarantine should be the number 40. To pretend to keep fit, I\u2019ve been doing 40 sit-ups and 40 weight-lifts a day. I did an online talk for film students and called it <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/399407221\">40 Days to Learn Film</a>. And I decided that, in my free time, I\u2019d watch films released in 1940.</p> <p>I skipped the famous ones \u2013 Hitchcock\u2019s Rebecca, Chaplin\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/18/chaplin-great-dictator-comedy\">The Great Dictator</a>, Cukor\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/12/the-philadelphia-story-review-rerelease\">The Philadelphia Story</a>, etc \u2013 because I\u2019d seen those and I seldom watch a film twice. I wanted to know what I didn\u2019t know about movies in 1940. I wanted an adventure. I feel alive when I\u2019m discovering something new.</p> <p>My first try was Son of Ingagi, a schlocky African American horror flick about a woman who keeps an ape-man in her basement. It is inept and visually flat, and I got a kick out of it as a predecessor of blaxploitation.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB82w0Ame6M\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rB82w0Ame6M?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Next was a Russian family film, Vasilisa the Beautiful, which starts bucolic then spirals off into the magic realms of a gnarly forest, backward walking cows, a rat man and a massive three headed dragon.

The fourth was even more of a discovery, a beautiful film about a little girl who gets lost in Moscow. Streets ahead of the Shirley Temple films of the same period, it was directed by one of the first female film-makers, Tatyana Lukashevich, and ends with the line: \u201cMama, let\u2019s get lost together tomorrow.\u201d Wow.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3fYLQVPr54\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/G3fYLQVPr54?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Next up for me is the Austrian musical <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/1940Operette24pWilliForst\">Operetta</a>, directed by Willi Forst.

I feel I\u2019m travelling the world from my sofa, just as I did as a boy when the movie magic casement first opened up to me on TV.</p> <p>If these discoveries continue, if my picture of 1940 builds, then I think I know what tattoo I\u2019ll get when the crisis ends: \u201c40.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>At the risk of undermining this admirable exercise in nostalgia, \u201cgame\u201d is a towering misnomer when attached to the peculiar art of rendering a fellow human being unconscious. As the late Brendan Ingle famously said, you don\u2019t play boxing; he also said it is the only sport when it is legal to kill someone.</p> <p>There were no deaths the bizarre Saturday night of 28 June 1997 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. No knockout, even. But there was much blood, most of it pouring from an inch-long open wound running along where the top of Evander Holyfield\u2019s right ear once resided. It was the third round of his world heavyweight rematch against the convicted rapist Mike Tyson, whom he had knocked out seven months earlier and who was having his sixth fight since being released from prison in 1995.</p> <p>Tyson\u2019s frothing mouth had ripped the cartilage from the champion\u2019s ear in a single chomp, and he then spat it like a dummy into the fetid air. This was no game. It was not even boxing. It was anarchy. I was maybe 20 feet away, alongside similarly gobsmacked colleagues. \u201cWhat the fuck was that?\u201d a nearby American writer said. It was, I thought later, a spectacle that might have been lifted from a crimson\u2011tinged Ralph Steadman illustration of one of Hunter S. Thompson\u2019s wilder fantasies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"09ce67b233375756e906df63618fa07b0df77a21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09ce67b233375756e906df63618fa07b0df77a21/0_0_1024_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Referee Lane Mills steps in as Evander Holyfield is bitten by Mike Tyson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Referee Lane Mills steps in as Evander Holyfield is bitten by Mike Tyson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Haynes/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the ear wriggled across the canvas into history, Holyfield, his face creased in agony, hopped around the ring like a child stung by a wasp. Tyson was bleeding from an earlier butt to his head, and, enraged, came at his wounded prey again before the referee, Mills Lane, briefly stopped the mayhem.</p> <p>Tyson told Lane he had punched the ear cartilage off. \u201cBullshit,\u201d shouted the referee, who knew what had happened, sure enough, but failed to process the enormity of the occasion. He called the doctor to inspect Holyfield\u2019s wound and insanity as great as the crime itself ensued.</p> <p>While Lane, a Nevada court and boxing judge of long experience, wanted to disqualify Tyson, the doctor persuaded him Holyfield was fit to continue \u2026 so Lane took two points off the seething miscreant, who was now drowning in his own confusion, and on they boxed.</p> <p>Defying all societal norms, it got worse. Tyson nipped the top of Holyfield\u2019s left ear and Lane, perhaps inured to the gore, more likely confused to the point of dangerous incompetence, allowed them to complete the round. The pause brought the fight to an end, both men bleeding freely. As Lane said later: \u201cOne bite is bad enough, two bites is dessert.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"73f272ef409f6615f773e66d99151af3c17b3f49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73f272ef409f6615f773e66d99151af3c17b3f49/0_144_2288_1373/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A close-up of the ear.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A close-up of the ear.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jed Jacobsohn/Allsport</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like the stolen bicycle that inspired a young Cassius Clay to take up boxing the ear disappeared.

David Letterman made jokes about pay\u2011per-chew and Fight of the Ear.</p> <p>Fifteen years later, Holyfield, forced out of his 109-room mansion and into bankruptcy through a string of bad relationships, auctioned the gloves he wore in the most infamous fight of modern times.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=Sport&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=My%20Favourite%20Game&amp;description=In%20our%20new%20series%2C%20Guardian%20writers%20recall%20the%20great%20sporting%20contests%20they%20will%20never%20forget&amp;read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsport%2Fseries%2Fmy-favourite-game&amp;links=false\" data-alt=\"My favourite game\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=Sport&opinion-tint=false&title=My%20Favourite%20Game&description=In%20our%20new%20series%2C%20Guardian%20writers%20recall%20the%20great%20sporting%20contests%20they%20will%20never%20forget&read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsport%2Fseries%2Fmy-favourite-game&links=false\">My favourite game</a> </figure>  <p>Not until his autobiography came out in 2013 did Tyson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jun/28/mike-tyson-bites-evander-holyfield-both-ears-boxing\" title=\"\">make a full confession</a>. \u201cI just wanted to kill him,\u201d he said. \u201cAnybody watching could see that the head-butts were so overt.

A capacity house of more than 18,000 brought in $17.3m; nearly two million Americans paid just under $100m in pay-per-view; closed circuit added $5.9m; international TV sales in 97 countries boosted the take by $21.2m.</p> <p>The ear never turned up again.</p> <p>Some game, boxing.</p> <p><em>\u2022 This article was amended on 30 March 2020 to remove the reference to \u2018jungle-grade\u2019</em></p>",
  "<p>Does the huge surge in US unemployment claims announced on Thursday mean that we are doomed to endure the 30% unemployment of which the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis has <a href=\"https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2020/march/back-envelope-estimates-next-quarters-unemployment-rate\">warned</a>?</p> <p>The answer is no. How high unemployment rises will depend on how quickly we ramp up <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JustinWolfers/status/1243186636814417921\">testing and the provision of protective equipment</a>, enabling us to determine when and where it is safe to return to work.</p> <p>But early evidence on the ability of countries like the US and UK to roll out tests and protective gear is not heartening. It\u2019s not too early, therefore, to start worrying about how sky-high unemployment will affect our economies and societies.</p> <p>In one scenario, the crisis will foster support for strong leaders who can issue strict directives and enforce them by any means necessary. We have seen how China, under President Xi Jinping, was able to lock down Wuhan, limit mobility and contain the coronavirus (for now). We have also seen how the crisis encourages identity politics \u2013 how President Trump uses it to justify his xenophobic tendencies. We have seen how the crisis breeds nationalism, as countries close their borders and prohibit exports of medical equipment, and as international groupings like the G20 blow hot air.</p> <p>These same reactive instincts were evident in the 1930s, the last time unemployment approached 30%. The role of unemployment in the rise of authoritarian figures like Hitler is disputed, but the most recent <a href=\"https://voxeu.org/article/financial-crisis-and-right-wing-extremism-germany-1931-33\">research</a> suggests a link. There was economic nationalism, in the form of trade wars, and the political nationalism of the American aviator and aspiring presidential candidate Charles Lindbergh, now conveniently <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Plot_Against_America_(miniseries)\">visible on the small screen</a>. There was Oswald Mosley\u2019s antisemitism. <a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/great-depression-repatriation-drives-mexico-deportation\">There was the harassment and deportation of Mexican Americans, including even hospital patients, </a>by the Los Angeles welfare department and US Department of Labor.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If ever there was a circumstance suited to rehabilitate experts and encourage respect for politicians who defer to them, this is it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But there is also a more hopeful scenario. Authoritarian leaders don\u2019t like bad news, which they tend to suppress, sometimes at cost to themselves. One hears about rumblings of a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/business/china-coronavirus-internet-police.html\">backlash</a> against Xi and his minions for having clamped down on news of the virus, thereby putting China at risk. Trump may similarly end up paying a price for having <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-outbreak.html\">suppressed warnings </a>from his own Department of Health and Human Services. If ever there was a circumstance suited to rehabilitate experts and encourage respect for politicians who defer to them, this is it.</p> <p>In the extreme, one can imagine the crisis pounding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/08/margaret-thatcher-ronald-reagan\">the last nails into the coffin of the Thatcher-Reagan revolution</a>. The idea that government should divest itself of its equity stake in essential infrastructure has already been abandoned, in Britain in the case of the railways and in the US, prospectively, the airlines. Old shibboleths about the need for budget balance and austerity have gone by the board. We are experiencing the most vivid possible reminder that the private sector, charitable bodies and local government alone <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/us/politics/swabs-for-coronavirus-testing.html\">can\u2019t be relied on for essential services.</a> They can\u2019t even be relied on for an adequate supply of testing swabs, the Trump White House, no less, having organized a military airlift of these last week.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/29/how-us-government-works-coronavirus-pandemic\">A shutdown - but not for government: how US federal employees provide vital services</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These are the same realizations, it can be argued, that gave <a href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/brave_new_world/welfare.html\">rise to the New Deal in the 1930s and the </a><a href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/brave_new_world/welfare.html\">Beveridge Report in 1942</a>, which created a very different social, economic and political order than existed before.</p> <p>The transformation may not be as dramatic this time. Even if unemployment rises to Depression levels, it can come back down quickly with medical mitigation and support from fiscal and monetary policies. The latter have been primed much more rapidly than in the 1930s. Measures to prevent bankruptcies and bank failures are being rolled out faster. Basic support for households is being provided through direct payments to taxpayers, expanded unemployment benefits, and grants to employers who avoid layoffs. All this might be thought to diminish the likelihood of a radical social and political realignment.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Ultimately, it was national security that begat social security</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But it was not just high unemployment that led to the welfare state, the mixed economy and more expansive government. In addition, it was the second world war and the realization that national security, even national survival, required shared sacrifice, and that public support for those who sacrificed was a necessary and appropriate quid pro quo. The Beveridge Report that created the British welfare state was a product of not just the 1930s but also of the second world war. The GI bill that expanded opportunities for education and homeownership for Americans was similarly a legacy of the war. Ultimately, it was national security that begat social security.</p> <p>Boris Johnson has vowed that \u201cwe must act like a wartime government\u201d. Donald Trump insists that he is a wartime president. If fighting the virus is indeed a battle tantamount to war, then the legacies of these politicians and the attitudes and values of their successors may turn out rather differently than they currently expect.</p> <ul> <li><p>Barry Eichengreen is the George C Pardee and Helen N Pardee professor of economics and professor of political science at the University of California, Berkeley</p></li> </ul>",

The message taken by some employers was that they were not essential. And we woke up to a whole lot of workplaces standing down or just sacking their employees. A lot of unions worked really hard to get people back to work - that was simply bad communication by governments, state and federal, that lead to that panic. </p> \n   <p>It became pretty clear by the middle of the week, it became clear by the middle of the week that the message employers had got was that they could let people go and they\u2019d be looked after by the social security system \u2013 and you saw the Centrelink lines was a product of that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The ACTU\u2019s proposal is for a wage subsidy, of 80% of workers\u2019 previous wage, capped at 80% of the median wage \u2013 a subsidy of up to $1,375 a week to be paid first by government to employers and then to their workers. </p> \n  <p>McManus confirmed that people who received the payment would still be counted as employed, and called for the measure to be backdated to unwind the \u201cdevastation\u201d of recent job losses.<br></p> \n  <p>McManus noted reports the government has opted instead for a $1,500 fortnightly payment, which she labelled \u201chighly inadequate\u201d as it would amount to about 44% of the median wage and \u201cabout half of what\u2019s needed\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Stanford estimated the cost of the ACTU\u2019s proposal would be \u201ctens of billions of dollars\u201d \u2013 but noted that paying wage subsidies would reduce the amount that will need to be spent on jobseeker payments.

  "<p>Good evening, and welcome to our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. These are the main stories on Monday 30 March.</p> <h2>Federal government announces wage subsidy</h2> <p>Businesses will be given wage subsidies of $1,500 a fortnight for each worker to keep staff on during the coronavirus crisis as part of an unprecedented $130bn package. Prime minister Scott Morrison said the package could help 6 million Australians. The federal government will give the allowance to businesses and not-for-profit organisations that have taken a 30% hit to turnover because of the coronavirus. Companies turning over more than $1bn will be eligible if they have taken a 50% hit. The subsidies will last for six months, with full-time, part-time and casual workers who have been with their employer for at least 12 months eligible. Sole traders have also been included in the package. Payments will flow to businesses in the first week of May, with the program to start from 30 March. Workers stood down since 1 March will be able to qualify for backdated payments.</p> <h2>States to enforce new physical distancing rules</h2> <p>Following the national cabinet\u2019s advice on Sunday that social gatherings be limited to two people \u2013 unless the people live in the same household \u2013 most states have today announced they will be enforcing the rule. Western Australia and Tasmania have said they will enforce the new limits, while Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory have gone further.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"email signup\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a></figcaption> </figure>  <p>Those states are also moving to enforce the new advice stipulating people should only leave the house for essential reasons \u2013 such as shopping for essentials, to receive medical care or to attend work, childcare or education that cannot be done from home. More detail on these rules and enforcement can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/coronavirus-two-person-rule-what-we-know-about-australias-new-social-distancing-measure\">be found here</a>. So far only the Northern Territory announced it would not be enforcing the new two-person rule, with chief minister, Michael Gunner, saying they would stick to the 10-person limit for now.</p> <h2>Australians returning home placed in hotel quarantine</h2> <p>Australians who have flown back to the country since midnight Saturday have been placed into an enforced 14-day quarantine in city hotels where some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/treated-worse-than-criminals-australian-arrivals-put-into-quarantine-lament-conditions\">say they are not permitted to leave rooms or open windows, and are being given inadequate food</a>. Paula Lemmon, who has multiple serious food allergies, has only been able to eat two small containers of chopped tomato and cucumber in almost 24 hours since arriving back in Australia and being placed in hotel quarantine in Sydney. \u201cWe completely understand travellers are a high risk \u2013 we are 100% for quarantining,\u201d Paula\u2019s daughter, Olivia, told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe\u2019d be happy to be in a caravan \u2026 But we\u2019re not staying at a five-star hotel, we\u2019re staying at a government-run quarantine centre and we\u2019re not getting basic needs.\u201d</p> <h2>Death toll rises to 18 after first deaths in ACT and Tasmania</h2> <p>The ACT and Tasmania recorded their first deaths from coronavirus. ACT chief health officer, Dr Kerryn Coleman<strong>,</strong> said a woman in her 80s died after catching the illness overseas. \u201cThis is the very sad reality of this disease, which is seeing the elderly at an increased risk of complications from Covid-19,\u201d she said. In Tasmania, a woman, also aged in her 80s, died on Monday morning at the North West Regional hospital in Burnie.</p> <h2>Northern Territory to enforce stricter border control</h2> <p>The Northern Territory is beefing-up its border controls, ordering all arrivals from interstate or overseas into 14-days of forced and supervised quarantine in response to the coronavirus pandemic. From midnight on Wednesday, all arrivals will have to comply with the new rules, while from midnight on Friday anyone who arrives will be forced to pay for their hotel stay during the quarantine period. Chief minister Michael Gunner said people wanting to come to the territory had been given enough notice that such travel was not advised. \u201cDo not come here, we do not want you here. Sorry, but not right now,\u201d he said. He said his aim with the new measures was to not just slow the flow of people across the border, but to stop it completely. So far the territory has recorded 15 confirmed Covid-19 cases, all linked to overseas travel.</p> <h2>Covid-19 modelling to be \u2018unlocked\u2019</h2> <p>The deputy chief medical officer committed to releasing the modelling the medical panel is using to guide its decisions, including the restrictions.

  "<p>While jogging on the spot, Mexican-American runner No\u00e9 \u00c1lvarez showed his passport to the border agent in Nogales, Arizona. \u00c1lvarez was participating in the <a href=\"https://peaceanddignity.net/\">Peace and Dignity Journeys</a> (PDJ), an ultramarathon for runners of indigenous background like himself. His group had run 3,200 miles from the Arctic to the US border with Mexico. They still had miles to go before their destination of the Panama Canal, but for \u00c1lvarez, the crossing into Mexico had extra meaning \u2013 it was the homeland of his parents before they immigrated to the US. The border agent, a fellow Latino, smirkingly asked if he was running in the wrong direction.</p> <p>It\u2019s an emotional moment in <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49411424-spirit-run\">\u00c1lvarez\u2019s new memoir</a>, Spirit Run: A 6,000-Mile Marathon Through North America\u2019s Stolen Land. The book chronicles not only that epic run in 2004 but also the background of the author and his immigrant parents.</p> <p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m still writing it,\u201d \u00c1lvarez says. \u201cIt continues to inform my life. It took me years to figure out how I was going to tell it.\u201d Ultimately, he decided on uniting the beauty of the journey and the messy moments along the way \u201cthrough the medium of running.\u201d</p> <p>And what a run it was. The PDJ is a quadrennial event intended to reconnect indigenous participants with their ancestral land, with the latest edition, which had been due to take place this year, postponed due to the Covid-19 outbreak. In 2004, \u00c1lvarez\u2019s group was heading south to rendezvous with another group running north from Argentina.</p> <p>\u201cWe ran beyond trying to burn calories,\u201d \u00c1lvarez says. \u201cThose [kind of] runners didn\u2019t last. It\u2019s bigger, larger than yourself \u2026 Before you knew it, 10, 15, 20 [miles a day] was easy,\u201d although, he clarifies, \u201cwe were hurting afterward.\u201d</p> <p>There were unexpected difficulties -- an encounter between \u00c1lvarez and a mountain lion in Oregon, stone-throwing motorists in Mexico, and tensions between the author and some of his fellow runners. And he didn\u2019t quite finish the way he intended to. But the first-time author has come to find satisfaction in both the run and his life trajectory.</p> <p>\u00c1lvarez grew up in Yakima, Washington, the son of Mexican immigrants of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pur%C3%A9pecha\">Pur\u00e9pecha</a> heritage. His father worked in an orchard, his mother at an apple-packing plant. As a teenager, he worked with his mother at the plant, describing the days as physically demanding; he said his mother is starting to lose sensation in her hands from overwork. He also started to run, although he grew up thinking of it as a way to keep one step ahead of immigration authorities.</p> <p>He received a full scholarship to Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington, but says he felt \u201ccultural shock on all sorts of levels. I had difficulties, there was the shame of failing, I could not save my family.\u201d Serendipitously, he learned of the PDJ from \u201ca friend of a friend of a friend.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI had to do this,\u201d \u00c1lvarez explains. \u201cIt was part of my escape. I was not connected to college at the time. It was not how I needed to learn. College was joining the run.\u201d</p> <p>He joined one month in, after the group had started its journey from Alaska. Their paths crossed in British Columbia. Fellow runners collectively represented nine indigenous communities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a19dda13b8d4853681220fa1f0ecc58b696695b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a19dda13b8d4853681220fa1f0ecc58b696695b8/0_124_2048_1412/1000.jpg\" alt=\"No\u00e9 \u00c1lvarez (second left) during his long journey\" width=\"1000\" height=\"689\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">No\u00e9 \u00c1lvarez (second left) during his long journey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jose Malvido</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt was interesting to see how fluid and multilayered our identities were,\u201d he says of his fellow participants, whom he portrays through composite characters in the book. They included runners of Mexican heritage living in Canada, and \u201can elder, our spiritual guide, from the Arctic.\u201d He noted that there were \u201csome former gang and military members and others completely living off the land,\u201d and women runners committed to \u201cfemale energy, healing power, balance.\u201d</p> <p>PDJ runners start and end each day with a ceremony, and carry feathered staffs during the run. Daily destinations are indigenous communities across North America. At each stop, community members share an important cultural story with the runners, signifying the story with a feather to add to the staff. Sometimes they also shared running traditions, including running as a group in the Tohono O\u2019odham territory in the Arizona desert.</p> <p>\u00c1lvarez, who had never run more than 10 miles in a day, would receive myriad tests. The PDJ takes place relay-style, with each runner committing to a certain amount of mileage each day while others wait their turn while traveling by motor vehicle. He learned to eat on the run, finding that a hard-boiled egg stuffed into his pocket might not be the wisest nourishment with wildlife around. He and his fellow runners slept in all manner of venues, from campgrounds to casinos, and encountered varying terrain, from the forests of Canada to the deserts of Washington and Arizona to the jungles of Mexico.</p> <p>\u201cIt was not just running blindly,\u201d \u00c1lvarez says. \u201cIt\u2019s a story about why land is important to people.\u201d He noted that in the Canadian forests, trees were being cut down for the ski industry and the Winter Olympics, while more arid areas were suffering from drought.</p> <p>\u201cWe honored the land that a lot of people depend on,\u201d \u00c1lvarez says. \u201cWe were physically walking, running and connecting with it every step of the way.\u201d</p> <p>In Oregon, he made an unexpected connection \u2013 a mountain lion waiting for him atop a peak.</p> <p>\u201cI was completely unprepared,\u201d \u00c1lvarez recalls. \u201cI couldn\u2019t run back. I had to keep moving forward.\u201d He says that when he joined the run, \u201cone guy, a really good friend and spiritual guide, talked about how to be thankful for the presence of an animal that decides to notice you, sort of take it as a message, an opportunity to reflect.\u201d</p> <p>In the book, \u00c1lvarez describes the mix of gratitude and footwork that helped him escape the big cat. \u201cLuckily, I\u2019m still here,\u201d he says. \u201cI did some studies on what you\u2019re supposed to do, and they said definitely don\u2019t run. It\u2019s definitely the dumbest thing I probably ever did.\u201d</p> <p>After the group crossed into Mexico, they encountered a different kind of danger: people who threw rocks from cars. Female runners were also at risk of assault; \u00c1lvarez describes one attempt that left some runners wary of continuing.</p> <p>\u201cWe came across situations with real shady encounters, people trying to force you into a vehicle, throw rocks at you, who didn\u2019t want you there,\u201d \u00c1lvarez says. \u201cWe adjusted, ran in pairs \u2026 Some territories were extremely unsafe. If you didn\u2019t want to run, you didn\u2019t have to. Others took on the miles.\u201d</p> <p>Ultimately, it was a familiar runner\u2019s story \u2013 injury \u2013 that determined \u00c1lvarez would finished his run in Guatemala before he could reach the Panama Canal. He calls it \u201cthe toughest decision, probably, I ever had to make.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to quit,\u201d he says. \u201cBut knowing when to quit was part of the lesson.\u201d</p> <p>This lesson has stayed with him ever since \u2013 as has the border officer\u2019s question about whether he was running in the wrong direction.</p> <p>\u201cI no longer think about the wrong direction,\u201d \u00c1lvarez says. \u201cI have a line of inquiry now, a ritual of asking the questions I need to.\u201d And, he says, \u201cRunning is the way I process things now.\u201d</p>",

And I know that sounds very over the top, but she got off the plane yesterday morning and all she\u2019s been offered since is cucumber and tomato.\u201d</p> <p>For breakfast on Monday, they were given a bread roll, a small croissant and a container of porridge to share between three.</p> <p>A friend has offered to cook meals and deliver them to the hotel, but no deliveries have been allowed.</p> <p>\u201cThe hotel manager said: \u2018You have to realise you\u2019re not staying in a hotel, the hotel is shut, you don\u2019t have the services of a hotel,\u2019\u201d Olivia said.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re all for the quarantine, but the way we\u2019ve been treated has been worse than criminals.

It is estimated the building trade generates 50,000 tonnes of plastic waste each year.</p> <p>Along with the architect Dr Gareth Abrahams from the university\u2019s School of Environmental Science, Maxwell has drafted a charter that they hope could become legally binding.</p> <p>The programme for the construction indusry includes:</p> <p>\u2022 the phasing out of paint containing plastic;<br>\u2022 the establishment of a \u201ctraffic light\u201d guide to warn which paints contain plastic to dissuade DIY consumers from buying them;<br>\u2022 the creation of a template house made without plastic;<br>\u2022 the end of the use of plastic wrapping for building materials such as bricks and cladding.</p> <p>Maxwell co-founded Changing Streams in 2018 after he and his wife toured the Arctic on a scientific exploration ship.

When I saw row upon row of things covered in plastic it turned my stomach \u2013 I had to get out of the shop.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I got home I realised I had to do something about plastic pollution.

  "<p>Of course, <em>good</em> parents would have already compiled a reading list ready for the day when they are holed up for an unspecified number of weeks with their beloved offspring in the face of a global pandemic unprecedented in modern times. The rest of us, however, will need to play a little catch-up once we\u2019ve finished setting up our makeshift home offices, explaining to aged parents that now is the time to keep calm but <em>not</em> carry on, shopping for immunocompromised neighbours, preparing slipshod lesson plans and secretly sobbing in abject terror under the stairs every two hours or so.

There is apocalyptic fare those for people who want to lean in to the situation (everything from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/jan/05/albert-camus-the-plague-fascist-death-ed-vulliamy\">Camus\u2019s</a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/jan/05/albert-camus-the-plague-fascist-death-ed-vulliamy\"> The Plague</a></em> to Stephen King\u2019s <em>The Stand</em>, usually via a few more contemporary takes such as Ling Ma\u2019s <em>Severance </em>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/25/station-eleven-review-emily-st-john-mandel\">Emily St John Mandel\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/25/station-eleven-review-emily-st-john-mandel\">Station Eleven</a></em>), and there is escapism (generally meaning either crime fiction that brings the comfort of neat resolution, or books rooted firmly in pre-Covid-19 reality, rather than fantasy worlds).</p> <p>Children being almost like people, the resonant/escapist divide makes an equally good starting point for their lists, too. In the former category, readers old enough to be aware of the current situation but not of an age or temperament to be frightened by it have plenty of dystopian fiction to devour. Beyond the primarily action-based likes of Suzanne Collins\u2019s The Hunger Games series there are more thoughtful, nuanced portrayals of life under altered circumstances such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jul/25/fiction.features2\">Meg Rosoff\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jul/25/fiction.features2\">How </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jul/25/fiction.features2\">I Live Now</a></em>, Polly Ho-Yen\u2019s <em>Boy in the Tower</em> or Gillian Cross\u2019s overlooked <em>After Tomorrow</em>.</p> <p>The escapist list encompasses so much else that of course you\u2019ll be able to construct it to cater as minutely to your own children\u2019s tastes as you wish \u2013 though if ever there was a time to make sure <em>The Lost Book of Adventure,</em> with its mixture of stories and survival tips, was included, it\u2019s now, and I would further note that Laura Ingalls Wilder\u2019s Little House on the Prairie series also functions very well as a juvenile prepper manual.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ed870ab04560a4a2d224d2b2170c2ccbdea051c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed870ab04560a4a2d224d2b2170c2ccbdea051c4/0_125_1497_898/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Day the Crayons Quit.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Day the Crayons Quit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oliver Jeffers</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But one often overlooked provision must be made \u2013 funny books. Comic material for children has historically been rare (one of the reasons the now alas withdrawn Roald Dahl Funny prize was set up) but things are improving. BJ Novak\u2019s <em>The Book With No Pictures</em> and <em>The Day the Crayons Quit</em> (plus sequel) will withstand multiple rereadings at multiple ages with no diminution of laughter, as will <em>Daddy\u2019s Sandwich</em> by Pip Jones and Laura Hughes. Elys Dolan has been a failsafe in this house from picture book age \u2013 our favourite is <em>Weasels</em>, in which certain members of the family Mustelidae are bent on world domination \u2013 up to about eight or nine, well-served by the (Wizarding/Knighthood/Royalty) <em>For Beginners</em> trio. The Dave Pigeon series by Swapna Haddow is a winner with that age group, too. Once children are into double figures I would be almost as frightened to recommend something to them collectively as \u201cfunny\u201d as I would to an adult audience, but I must note that in this house Maz Evans\u2019s Who Let the Gods Out? series can do no wrong, and that a book that has kept me laughing from the age of 10 and throughout the three and a half decades since, <em>Private \u2013 Keep Out</em> by Gwen Grant, was republished last year by Vintage Children\u2019s Classics. I\u2019m grinning as I type. A special shout out must be given, however, to Frank Cottrell Boyce\u2019s <em>The Astounding Broccoli Boy</em>, which is a funny book \u2026 about a pandemic! It may yet become the Covid generation\u2019s <em>Decameron</em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"fb77e890873026f8c0a92361e669f7c80f0c75ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb77e890873026f8c0a92361e669f7c80f0c75ee/0_0_326_499/326.jpg\" alt=\"Charlie Changes Into a Chicken\" width=\"326\" height=\"499\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It would also be sensible, of course, to sneak in a few books that approach the subject of anxiety and how to cope with it. Standout titles for the very young include <em>Ruby\u2019s Worry</em> (part of Tom Percival\u2019s Big Bright Feelings series), <em>After the Fall</em> by Dan Santat (with the irresistible subtitle <em>How Humpty Dumpty Got Back Up Again</em>), <em>The Koala Who Could</em> by Rachel Bright and Jim Field (about Kevin, my spirit animal, who cannot cope with change and prefers to keep clinging to his tree). Those a little older have the Sam Wu Is Not Afraid of \u2026 collection by Katie and Kevin Tsang to work through (the comfort of having a series, in any genre, to immerse yourself in is a particular bonus in stressful times). <em>Charlie Changes Into a Chicken</em> by Sam Copeland and illustrated by Sarah Horne falls under the \u201cfunny as heck\u201d heading too.</p> <p>For children a little older than that there is the stunning wordless graphic novel <em>Small Things</em> by the late Mel Tregonning, about a small boy whose self is being eaten away by strange shapes. It was completed, after Tregonning died, by Shaun Tan, whose own book, <em>The Arrival</em>, about the dislocation felt by a refugee coming to a strange land, offers its own pertinent message. For the YA crowd, <em>Am I Normal Yet?</em> by Holly Bourne has a protagonist who lives her life with OCD and <em>Boys Don\u2019t Cry</em> by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/25/malorie-blackman-time-is-right-for-bbc-noughts-and-crosses-drama\">Malorie Blackman</a> has a valuable subplot about his brother having to grapple with anxiety. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6e2f9210d1fe7ffe1f116e00d3c1ca423015caf3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e2f9210d1fe7ffe1f116e00d3c1ca423015caf3/0_0_2663_3506/760.jpg\" alt=\"Small Things\" width=\"760\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This is also a chance to encourage children to try new things, broaden their tastes, venture out of their comfort zones. And of course, reading aloud means that you can introduce them to more sophisticated books than they would be able to handle independently, which is both a pleasure in itself and a useful way of planting seeds of interest for the future. You could read them complex, evocative narratives such as Frances Hardinge\u2019s <em>The Lie Tree</em>, or introduce them to the childhood books that shaped you, both classics and glorious oddities.</p> <p>In the midst of chaos, reading to a child can create a small oasis of calm, for both of you, so try not to think of it as just another task. It\u2019s not about powering through the book as quickly as possible. It\u2019s about exploring the highways and byways as you go. If the one thing this awful crisis has given us, it\u2019s time. Books and children respond well to that. So let\u2019s all take a breath, crack a spine and try to read through these very strangest of days together.</p> <p><em>Bookworm: a Memoir of Childhood Reading</em> by Lucy Mangan is published by Vintage paperback, \u00a38.99</p>",

If they don\u2019t work for a day, their wallets are empty. The first thing you notice when you walk into the home of a poor Indian is the absence of any processed or packaged foods. There are no jars, packets, bottles or boxes, nothing that can last. No packet of biscuits or noodles or a can of beans. There is never enough money to buy these superfluous items; the money is enough only for the vegetables or dal needed for one meal, and even the quantity of that meal is carefully calibrated to appetite as there is no fridge to keep any leftovers.</p> \n<p>If they need medicines, they ask the chemist for the number of pills \u2013 paracetamol, say \u2013 they need for that day rather than buying a strip.</p> \n<p>The crucial difference is that the poor have no buffer, no reserves of anything, whether money, food or medicines.

  "<p>Last week, as the nation engaged in a coordinated applause for the NHS and its workers on the frontline of the coronavirus pandemic, there was, in the middle of a profound sense of community, a jarring moment: <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/video/boris-johnson-rishi-sunak-clap-nhs-2139202/\">Boris Johnson emerged from </a><a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/video/boris-johnson-rishi-sunak-clap-nhs-2139202/\">No 10 and began clapping, along with Rishi Sunak</a>. The prime minister punctuated his applause with awkward exclamations: \u201cWe\u2019ll keep supporting you in any way we can.\u201d At one point he turned to Sunak, \u201cIsn\u2019t that right, Rishi?\u201d to which the chancellor replied, \u201cWhatever you need, that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to get!\u201d It all had the air of a friend who had habitually ignored you, then one day unexpectedly needed you, and so returned with empty gestures of affection.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Austerity has already claimed lives, but  coronavirus deaths are not as easy to style out</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And empty is what these gestures are when they come from the Conservative party, whose record and current performance suggest nothing close to \u201csupporting in any way we can\u201d. Frontline NHS staff do not have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/advice-on-protective-gear-for-nhs-staff-was-rejected-owing-to-cost\">sufficient protective equipment</a> or even access to coronavirus tests: they are merely instructed to self-isolate once their symptoms reach a certain threshold. And the reason so many NHS staff have to work extra hours with no pay is because they do not have the resources to do otherwise \u2013 something that many of us knew as we stood up and clapped and cheered for them as a nation. Those resources have been consistently and deliberately <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/25/boris-johnson-conservatives-nhs-funding\">drained from the NHS</a> since the Conservative-Liberal coalition came to power in 2010. From <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/dec/03/universities-warned-cameron-2011-trainee-cuts-nursing-shortage\">defunding nurse training</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/29/private-firms-handed-15bn-in-nhs-contracts-over-past-five-years\">selling off parts of the NHS</a> to private companies, the Tory party in power has hobbled the healthcare system\u2019s ability to deal with the everyday, let alone the exceptional. <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/watch-moment-tories-cheered-blocking-10707293\">Conservative MPs cheered</a> the result of a parliamentary vote in 2017 that blocked a pay rise for nurses, of which there is a <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2019-09-17/patient-care-suffering-due-to-lack-of-nurses/\">severe shortage in the NHS</a><a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2019-09-17/patient-care-suffering-due-to-lack-of-nurses/\"> \u2013 40,000 in England alone</a>.</p> <p>There is a phrase in Arabic that translates as: \u201cThey killed him, then walked at his funeral.\u201d The current government has perfected this game, squeezing the NHS\u2019s budget, slashing welfare, hacking at the public sector, severely restricting urgently needed immigrant labour, and then diverting the political fallout from those issues on to other targets. All while maintaining the fiction \u2013 amid scandals, resignations and botched policymaking \u2013 that a rightwing party of competent fiscally sensible grownups is the most rational choice.</p> <p>This party of cool-headed responsibility has fielded a prime minister in crisis who seems ever more incompetent every passing day. Shifty, bored, he is deprived of his one trick: tickling an audience into the laughter he needs to compensate for his lack of substance. A few weeks after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/27/i-shook-hands-with-everybody-says-boris-johnson-weeks-before-coronavirus-diagnosis-video\">jolly boast</a> that he shook hands with coronavirus patients, the joke ended with him contracting the virus himself. So accustomed have we become to this government\u2019s posturing that the deadpan presence of Sunak reading a financial support statement, with the customary (and minimal) amount of recognition of what we are going through as a nation, was seen by commentators as enough to anoint him a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/lucky-man-sunak-dishes-the-dosh-and-eyes-up-johnsons-job\">PM-in-waiting</a>.</p> <p>This is the natural conclusion for a party that has substituted culture for policy \u2013 a shift with dire consequences for the public\u2019s ability to hold government to account for its performance. The Brexit referendum accelerated this. When politics is reduced to nothing but rhetoric about<strong> </strong>taking back control and getting Brexit done, the entire news complex also starts to function along those lines. Journalism spends less time scrutinising performance and concrete achievements, and more time covering the politics of division, or becoming divisive itself. And while the media and rightwing politicians and many newspapers fixated endlessly on immigration, Muslims, the liberal elite, the traitors in the judiciary and the citizen of nowhere, a pandemic was quietly making its way to us \u2013 to expose the way that our public health system, our labour rights and our consumer protections had all been gutted or neglected during this time.</p> <p>But the link will not necessarily be made in voters\u2019 minds. Austerity and the withdrawal of the state have gone on for so long that many have forgotten that it wasn\u2019t always like this, and that it doesn\u2019t always have to be. The Tory government itself pretends that it would love to help but its hands are tied: by open borders, by the EU, by the need to deal with the fiscal mess allegedly left by New Labour\u2019s social spending (but not by the bailing out of the financial sector). Help can be wrested from the government by harassing it publicly on discrete single issues: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-52048632\">free parking for NHS doctors</a>, compensation for Windrush victims. And once the spotlight fades, the government\u2019s fist tightens once again.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/24/britain-benefits-rishi-sunak-claimants-austerity\">The middle class are about to discover the cruelty of Britain's benefits system | Polly Toynbee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is nothing inherently wrong with campaigning and governing by way of providing voters with a sort of currency of identity, but it cannot be everything.

Despite warnings, the government, and Johnson, minimised the threat and defied the science, reaching for exceptionalism, for the optics of cheerfully shaking hands with the afflicted. But that isn\u2019t the whole story. Johnson has the licence to clap an NHS his party has suffocated because the Conservatives have successfully created an ecosystem that fortifies them against the consequences of their mendacity and their failure.</p> <p>In stable times the cost of that can be hidden. Austerity has already claimed lives; but, because of their speed and visibility, coronavirus deaths are not as easy to style out. We no longer know how to hold a government to account on the truly important matters of the day.

Because we\u2019ve been doing more testing, so we have bigger numbers to look at.\u201d</p> <p>That is a misleading description of what has happened in the US. It\u2019s true that it is hard to make direct comparisons between countries, given that each country has different criteria for testing and some countries are probably failing to disclose the full extent of the pandemic in their area.</p> <p>But to say that the US is testing more people than anywhere in the world is to give a false reckoning of what has happened in a country where testing has come on stream very late in the day. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention botched the original roll-out and the Trump administration was slow to allow private and state laboratories to develop their own tests. </p> <p>Governors in states around the country continue to complain that they have woefully inadequate testing. Even Washington state, which saw the first confirmed case and death in the US, has insufficient tests to tell how many people really are infected.</p> <p>The comparison that is most revealing continues to be with South Korea, which by contrast began mass testing very quickly and aggressively. South Korea has tested more than five times as many of its population per capita than the US.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/trump-coronavirus-misleading-claims\">Five of Donald Trump's most misleading coronavirus claims</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-29T22:16:20.454Z\">at 11.16pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e811aba8f081e5eda2392b6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-29T22:01:37.876Z\">11.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Trump says FEMA is working with private companies to launch Project Airbridge, to expedite the movement of critical supplies from other countries to the United States.</p> <p>\u201cThe first flight arrived at JFK airport in New York this morning filled with 80 tons of personal protective equipment, including 130,000 N95 respirators \u2013 hose are the ones that we were talking about before \u2013 1.8 million face masks and gowns, 10.3 million gloves and many other things.

As you know, the original proposal was to consider seriously an enforceable quarantine. After discussions with the president, we made it clear, and he agreed, that it would be much better to do what\u2019s called a strong advisory,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cAnd the reason for that is that you don\u2019t want to get to the point where you\u2019re being \u2013 enforcing things that would create a bigger difficulty, morale and otherwise, when you could probably accomplish the same goal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne of the issues is that the infection rate in New York City, in the New York City area, is about 56% of all of the new infections in the country are coming from that area. That\u2019s terrible suffering for the people of New York, which I feel myself personally, as a New Yorker,\u201d Fauci said. </p> <p>\u201cSo what was trying to be done is to get people, unless there\u2019s necessary travel, so, all nonessential travel, to just hold off, because what you don\u2019t want is people traveling from that area to other areas of the country, and inadvertently and innocently infecting other individuals,\u201d he continued.</p> <p>\u201cWe felt the better part of \u2013 way to do this would be an advisory, as opposed to a very strict quarantine. And the president agreed. And that\u2019s why he made that determination last night. And I believe he tweeted it out last night.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Deborah Birx, White House coronavirus task force coordinator, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/governors-warn-shortages-will-put-their-states-dire-straits-early-n1171531\">said</a> on NBC\u2019s Meet The Press that Covid-19 would impact the entire US. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been raising the alert in all metro areas and in all states.

There are now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/mar/29/coronavirus-map-of-the-us-latest-cases-state-by-state\">nearly 125,000 cases confirmed in the US</a> and more than 2,000 deaths. New York state is by far the worst hit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7f3586ee36a79bf418ad782a623b9b1b59dd221a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f3586ee36a79bf418ad782a623b9b1b59dd221a/947_400_1546_1933/800.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Cuomo.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrew Cuomo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeenah Moon/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Trump\u2019s America, Saturday saw an ordinarily extraordinary procession of events. First, Donald Trump ignored official advice against unnecessary travel and went to Norfolk, Virginia, to see off the USNS Comfort, a huge ship headed for New York harbour to provide extra hospital beds to a city health system on the verge of collapse. </p> <p>As he did so, the president floated without fanfare the idea of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/donald-trump-virginia-usns-comfort-travel\">some sort of quarantine for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut</a>. This first took New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, by surprise, then made him angry. The dubious legality of such a move aside, Cuomo said, it would lead to \u201cchaos and mayhem\u201d and amount to a \u201cfederal declaration of war\u201d on the states involved.</p> <p>Trump backed off, but the federal CDC later issued <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/coronavirus-states-touching-new-york-city-told-to-stop-non-essential-travel\">stern advisory against non-essential travel</a> in the tri-state area. In Rhode Island, all the while, national guard troops were knocking on doors, looking for New Yorkers to quarantine. Cuomo wasn\u2019t happy about that, either.</p> <p>And so on Sunday the US awoke to another day of fear and uncertainty. In Illinois, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/coronavirus-illinois-governor-announces-rare-death-of-baby\">the first US infant death from coronavirus</a> has been reported. In immigration detention facilities across the country and particularly in the south, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/29/detainees-coronavirus-us-immigration-ice\">tension is rising</a>. Many immigrants <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/i-have-a-broken-heart-trump-policy-has-immigrants-backing-away-from-healthcare-amid-crisis\">dare not use</a> public health services. And as our national correspondent Tom McCarthy explains here, Democratic states seem to be taking public measures to stop the spread of the virus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/29/america-states-coronavirus-red-blue-different-approaches\">more seriously than those run by Republicans</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/mar/29/coronavirus-map-of-the-us-latest-cases-state-by-state\">Coronavirus map of the US: latest cases state by state</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bryan Armen Graham will be here later to take you through the day.
