  "<p>The sixth mass extinction of wildlife on Earth is accelerating, according to an analysis by scientists who warn it may be a tipping point for the collapse of civilisation.</p> <p>More than 500 species of land animals were found to be on the brink of extinction and likely to be lost within 20 years. In comparison, the same number were lost over the whole of the last century. Without the human destruction of nature, even this rate of loss would have taken thousands of years, the scientists said.</p> <p>The land vertebrates on the verge of extinction, with fewer than 1,000 individuals left, include&nbsp;the Sumatran rhino, the Clari\u00f3n wren, the Espa\u00f1ola giant tortoise and the harlequin frog. Historic data was available for 77 of the species and the scientists found these had lost 94% of their populations.</p> <p>The researchers also warned of a domino effect, with the loss of one species tipping others that depend on it over the edge. \u201cExtinction breeds extinctions,\u201d they said, noting that unlike other environmental problems extinction is irreversible.</p> <p>Humanity relies on biodiversity for its health and wellbeing, scientists said, with the coronavirus pandemic an extreme example of the dangers of ravaging the natural world. Rising human population, destruction of habitats, the wildlife trade, pollution and the climate crisis must all be urgently tackled, they said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/06/human-society-under-urgent-threat-loss-earth-natural-life-un-report\">Human society under urgent threat from loss of Earth's natural life</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhen humanity exterminates other creatures, it is sawing off the limb on which it is sitting, destroying working parts of our own life-support system,\u201d said Prof Paul Ehrlich, of Stanford University in the US, and one of the research team. \u201cThe conservation of endangered species should be elevated to a global emergency for governments and institutions, equal to the climate disruption to which it is linked.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7fec205a29920e7c9e356f6bbcb08d4a78c9d429\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7fec205a29920e7c9e356f6bbcb08d4a78c9d429/0_142_2107_1264/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harlequin frog\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harlequin frog.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerardo Ceballos/University of Mexico/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe are facing our final opportunity to ensure that the many services nature provides us do not get irretrievably sabotaged,\u201d said Prof Gerardo Ceballos of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, who led the research.&nbsp;</p> <p>The analysis, <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1922686117\">published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a>, examined data on 29,400 land vertebrate species compiled by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and BirdLife International. The researchers identified 515 species with populations below 1,000 and about half of these had fewer than 250 remaining. Most of these mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians were found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p> <p>Scientists discovered that 388 species of land vertebrate had populations under 5,000, and the vast majority (84%) lived in the same regions as the species with populations under 1,000, creating the conditions for a domino effect.</p> <p>Known examples of this include the overhunting of sea otters, the main predator of kelp-eating sea urchins.

A declining trend for the population is also important and both factors are used in the IUCN Red List, she said.</p> <p>\u201cAction is important for many reasons, not least of which is that directly and indirectly we rely on the rest of life on Earth for our own health and wellbeing,\u201d she said. \u201cDisrupting nature leads to costly and often hard-to-reverse effects. Covid-19 is an extreme present-day example, but there are many more.\u201d</p> <p>Mark Wright, the director of science at WWF, said: \u201cThe numbers in this research are shocking. However, there is still hope. If we stop the land-grabbing and devastating deforestation in countries such as Brazil, we can start to bend the curve in biodiversity loss and climate change.

But the Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, says<a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2020/may/speaker-agrees-to-recall-of-parliament/\"> it is not safe to return to the old system of voting, involving large numbers of MPs crowding into the division lobbies.</a> Instead Rees-Mogg will ask MPs tomorrow to agree to a new system of voting, reportedly one that would involve MPs having to form an enormous queue all around parliament so that they can vote in person while observing social distancing.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/thehouse/article/the-virtual-parliament-is-no-longer-necessary-we-can-do-so-much-better\">an article for the House magazine </a>Rees-Mogg explains why he thinks it is so important for MPs to return to the Commons in person. Here\u2019s an excerpt.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It comes down to the quality of communication between MPs and ministers. Politics is better done face-to-face, even if the whites of the ministerial eyes are six feet away. In the chamber frontbenchers will have to keep on their toes as interventions are once again made possible. This exceptional aspect of British democracy, curtailed under the hybrid halfway house, can once again flourish.</p> <p>Out of the chamber, too, MPs will be able to come together - at the right social distance - to represent shared problems faced by those in multiple constituencies. This is what Edmund Burke meant when he wrote that parliament should be a \u201cdeliberative assembly of one nation\u201d rather than a \u201ccongress of ambassadors from different and hostile interests\u201d. Cross-party work is often under-reported but is an important part of our system. With MPs present in Westminster, rather than scattered hither and thither, voters\u2019 interests will be better represented.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Labour MP <strong>Dame Margaret Hodge</strong>, who is in the \u201cvulnerable\u201d category, says the Rees-Mogg proposal will disenfranchise MPs like her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/margarethodge/status/1267459620399984641\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Tomorrow the Govt wants 650 MPs to stand in a giant queue to vote on how the Commons makes decisions from now on.

He explains: <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As state primary schools in England open today, so too do their independent counterparts, often known as prep schools. Christopher King, the chief executive of the <strong>I</strong><strong>ndependent Association of Prep Schools</strong>, says almost all of the 550 prep schools in England belonging to IAPS have opened to year 6 pupils this morning. Those with nurseries or \u201cpre-prep\u201d are also opening to reception and year 1 age groups, with what King calls a mixture of enthusiasm and apprehension.</p> <p>\u2018The vast majority of prep schools in England are open today, apart from a few that are opening tomorrow. They are enthusiastic about reopening, but for staff and parents there is a degree of apprehension particularly because of the younger year groups and the difficulty in social distancing,\u2019 King said.</p> <p>Like state schools, prep schools remained open for the children of key workers and to provide remote learning for the rest of their pupils. Initial reports of unhappy parents saw many private schools cut their fees by 10%-20% for this term.</p> <p>The situation is different in secondary schools, where neither state nor independent senior schools are reopening for the rest of the school year in England, other than for brief visits by year 10 and year 12 pupils from 15 June. In any case, boarding schools such as Eton would face additional complications in reopening because of the coronavirus regulations around residential education.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>UPDATE:</em> Although in the past it was true that Conservative MPs mostly sent their children to private schools, that is probably not the case now.

These are people who, for the last 10 weeks, have been told to stay in their homes 24/7, without any break for exercise or fresh air. </p> <p>This marks a remarkable U-turn from ministers. Previous guidance advised that people with serious underlying health conditions, such as lung disease or low immunity, would need to shield until the <a href=\"https://shropshireccg.nhs.uk/health-advice/coronavirus-advice/shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-groups/\">end of June</a>.

The latest update \u2013 announced via tweets at 10pm on a Saturday night and trailed in the press \u2013 was like moving the goalposts on the quiet. Rather than hearing it first from a government briefing or from their doctor, shielders had to find out about the change on social media. </p> <p>When I spoke to people affected, the reaction was one of confusion, anxiety, and anger.

But at a press conference last week <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-press-conference-statement-on-the-five-tests-28-may-2020\">Boris Johnson claimed that all five tests were being achieved.</a></p> <p>The five tests were originally set out by Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/16/coronavirus-uk-live-news-covid-19-lockdown-extension?page=with:block-5e988f548f08cf571cdb2645#block-5e988f548f08cf571cdb2645\">at a press conference in April</a> (when Johnson was ill). Here they are, with the rival assessments for each test from Johnson in his speech last week and from the ADPH yesterday <a href=\"https://www.adph.org.uk/2020/05/adph-presidential-blog-a-time-for-steady-leadership-careful-preparation-and-measured-steps/\">in its statement.</a></p> <p>The PM says all five tests have been passed. The ADPH accepts that the first test has been met, but on the other four it says it is too soon to be sure.</p> <p><strong><em>1 - NHS\u2019s ability to cope must be protected</em></strong></p> <p>What PM says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At the start of the outbreak, there was significant concern that the NHS would not be able to cope. That turned out not to be the case, thanks to the heroic efforts of everyone who works in the NHS. And the heroic efforts of the British people to contain this virus. </p> <p>The data show that on 26 May, 475 people were admitted to hospital in England with coronavirus - down from a peak of 3,121 on a single day, on 2 April.</p> <p>On 27 May, 11% of mechanical ventilator beds in the UK were occupied by patients with coronavirus, down from a peak of 41% on 10 April.</p> </blockquote> <p>What ADPH says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Firstly, the pressure on the NHS \u2013 and those that tirelessly and expertly work within it \u2013 has been significant but it has been able to cope with those who unfortunately need hospital treatment for the effects of Covid-19. The number of people in hospitals with Covid-19 is falling, and beds are available for those that require them.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>2 - Sustained and consistent fall in daily death rates</em></strong></p> <p>What PM says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As measured by a seven-day rolling average, the UK daily death rate now stands at 256, down from a peak of 943 on 14 April.</p> <p>While every death is one too many, it is now the case that there has been a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rate, and so the second test is being met.</p> </blockquote> <p>What ADPH says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Secondly, there must be a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rate. While the first peak in deaths has passed, the downward trend is slow \u2013 particularly in care settings. Deaths are a measure of what happened roughly two weeks before \u2013 the effect of easing measures now will only become evident in two weeks.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>3 - Rate of infection decreasing to manageable levels</em></strong></p> <p>What PM says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>And in the last seven days, an average of 2,312 new cases were confirmed with a positive test, that\u2019s down from a peak of 5,066 in the first week of May.</p> <p>Based on the various data available, the government is satisfied that the third test is being met.</p> </blockquote> <p>What ADPH says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The critical debate is about the third test \u2013 ensuring the rate of transmission of the infection continues decreasing to manageable levels (taken to mean R being well below 1). The rapid and multiple ways in which measures are being eased is likely to make it difficult to judge the cumulative impact on R. As we saw in March, R can go above 1 in a very short space of time \u2013 and once it does it can take many months to bring it back down. The room for manoeuvre is tight.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>4 - Testing capacity and PPE supply at adequate levels</em></strong></p> <p>What PM says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Yesterday we carried out 119,587 tests, compared to around 12,000 at the start of April. Testing capacity has now increased to 161,214 a day.</p> <p>We have now signed over 100 new deals with PPE suppliers around the world. Here in the UK, thanks to the efforts of Lord Deighton and his team and the brilliance of domestic manufacturers we have signed contracts for over two billion items of PPE, including face masks, visors, gowns and aprons.</p> </blockquote> <p>What ADPH says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The fourth aspect, ensuring supply of tests and PPE is able meet future demand, remains an enormous challenge. PPE manufacturing and supply chains are stronger, but shortages are still being reported and it is not clear that supply can meet new demand as different parts of society, public services and the economy open. While testing capacity has undoubtedly increased, we are not yet confident that the current testing regime is sufficiently effective in getting the priority tests done and the results to where they are needed to enable swift action.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>5 - No risk of a second peak that would overwhelm NHS</em></strong></p> <p>What PM says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This package has been carefully designed so that we can ease the burdens of lockdown while expecting to keep that R below one. I cannot and will not throw away all the gains we have made together, and so the changes we are making are limited and cautious.</p> </blockquote> <p>What ADPH says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Finally, the fifth test. A second peak cannot be ruled out \u2013 whether it will overwhelm the NHS is an important question to ask. But perhaps the even bigger one is, do we really want the same number of deaths again? The scale to date represents an unimaginable tragedy and we must do everything possible to limit further loss of life.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T09:08:58.006Z\">at 10.08am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ed4b8aa8f08f5e3730122cc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/andrewsparrow\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T08:25:11.227Z\">9.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Good morning.

Here is an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Directors of Public Health are increasingly concerned that the government is misjudging this balancing act and lifting too many restrictions, too quickly. </p> <p>This is a new disease; evidence is still emerging and there is much uncertainty. However, based on what is currently known, several leading scientists and public health experts have spoken out about a string of recent national policy announcements affecting England which project a degree of confidence that many \u2013 including ADPH members \u2013 do not think is supported by the science.</p> <p>Over the weekend we have seen signs that the public is no longer keeping as strictly to social distancing as it was \u2013 along with this, we are concerned that the resolve on personal hygiene measures, and the need to immediately self-isolate, if symptomatic, is waning. A relentless effort to regain and rebuild public confidence and trust following recent events is essential.</p> </blockquote> <p>De Gruchy expanded on this in an interview on the Today programme this morning. She said local directors of public health could only be effective if other parts of the anti-coronavirus programme were working too. She went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So we need testing, the national testing programme, to be absolutely robust and ready, and we need the NHS test and trace to be robust and ready. And of course the other issue ... is about PPE and the supply of PPE. So all of those organisational challenges that we are all working really hard getting in place - we\u2019re not feeling, just yet, that we are really confident enough to meet any potential challenge if the government goes too quickly on easing lockdown measures.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T08:37:02.406Z\">at 9.37am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ed4b1498f084df971c8d53a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T07:44:28.682Z\">8.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More than 200 travel and hospitality businesses have joined a campaign urging the government to overturn its planned 14-day quarantine for arrivals into the UK, PA Media reports.</p> <p>The group of major hotels, travel companies and restaurateurs claim the policy is \u201cunworkable\u201d and are calling for air bridges to be created which enable people to travel - without being quarantined - between countries where the risk of being infected by coronavirus is deemed to be low.</p> <p>George Morgan-Grenville, the chief executive of tour operator Red Savannah, who is leading the campaign, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is not just a group of company bosses complaining, but employees from bottom to top calling for the quarantine plans to be quashed.</p> <p>The extent of their pain is deeply worrying for our economy and our country.</p> </blockquote> <p>More than 200 businesses have signed the letter to the home secretory, Priti Patel. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T07:51:00.035Z\">at 8.51am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ed4aade8f08f5e37301227a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T07:21:09.052Z\">8.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Guardian\u2019s Today in Focus podcast is exploring the coronavirus crisis in Britain\u2019s prisons.</p> <p>When Britain went into lockdown in March, most people were confined to their homes with little more than a short daily walk allowed.

It\u2019s difficult for the BHA to consult with the stalls handlers, because they don\u2019t have a specific representative body. But the BHA assures me it met and engaged with employers of the handlers (Racetech and ARC), as well as with its own starters in formulating the protocols, which include disinfecting of equipment. There was a test at Lingfield on Friday with six handlers, which apparently went well and no concerns were raised, I\u2019m told.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/05/stalls-handlers-issue-safety-warning-over-horse-racing-return-to-action\">Talking Horses: stalls handlers have safety fears plus Hong Kong tips</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed503cc8f08f5e373012628\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T13:34:35.817Z\">2.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A supportive tweet from the travelling head lad to Newmarket trainer Hugo Palmer</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/pjmcculloch01/status/1267409261111513089\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Credit where credit is due <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NewcastleRaces?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NewcastleRaces</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JRFArmstrong?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@JRFArmstrong</a> free hampers for racing staff great gesture much appreciated <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NARSnewsinfo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NARSnewsinfo</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RacingPost?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@RacingPost</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidmilnesHQ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@davidmilnesHQ</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NTFnews?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NTFnews</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BHAPressOffice?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BHAPressOffice</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/XWr6SWT6dB\">pic.twitter.com/XWr6SWT6dB</a></p>\u2014 peter mcculloch (@pjmcculloch01) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pjmcculloch01/status/1267409261111513089?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 1, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed502de8f084df971c8d8cb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T13:31:12.376Z\">2.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Mick Appleby has got on the scoresheet thanks to Edraak, after a disappointment in the first race with Stone Mason.

But it\u2019s tens of millions of pounds of lost attendance income across the industry. Say your ticket is \u00a330 and you have 30,000 tickets, it starts to get extremely expensive and it will take racecourses some time to recover, at least until the backend of next year. <br><br>\u201cI think there will be a reshaping of the industry, but I\u2019m not quite sure exactly how that\u2019s going to play out. In our case, at least until September we\u2019re not racing at Brighton and Worcester and it could be that we narrow even further the tracks that will race this year. When you get to that position, you do have to wonder whether an individual racetrack, where you\u2019ve got declining retail media rights [from betting shops], is able to have a future. <br><br>\u201cI sincerely hope that there won\u2019t be any casualties but I do fear for some racecourses.\u201d </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed4fa728f08f5e3730125b7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T12:55:48.461Z\">1.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>\u201cVery gluey, very testing,\u201d is the verdict from jockey Ben Robinson, who won the second race on Little Jo.

Speak Of The Devil, meanwhile, walked out of the stalls and was free at the back of a slowly run race before quickening through traffic to nick second. It looked more like an exercise gallop than a race for her and hopefully she can improve for it. Drying ground might not be in her favour, however, as she\u2019s a half-sister to that noted mudlover Morando. I\u2019ve seen the going described as soft but I expect it\u2019ll have dried out to good by the time of the Classics. <strong>Ellerslie Lace</strong> doesn\u2019t look good enough to win but she might nick a place at 50-1. She was only three lengths behind Tropbeau last time and drying ground looks a plus for her. <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed4f7738f08f5e37301257c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T12:43:36.967Z\">1.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The betting market got a bit closer to sorting that race out, Little Jo being a previous winner at this course and therefore easier to spot than our first winner.

Ordinarily, they\u2019d be at Longchamp but the Parisian tracks have been closed for the time being because Covid-19 remains too much of a problem in the area, so French racing is focused on the Normandy coast. <br> It may make a difference because Deauville\u2019s mile is straight, whereas the trials have been run on turning tracks and often at a false pace. Today\u2019s Poule d\u2019Essai Des Poulains ought to be run at a stronger clip, because of the status of the race and also because there are no fewer than three runners who made all the running last time. Each of them was gifted a soft lead, which surely won\u2019t happen today; will they fight for the lead? I think the circumstances give a chance to <strong>Kenway (2.50pm BST)</strong>, a 25-1 shot. You\u2019d think he\u2019d be exposed after nine runs and he was well held by some of these at Longchamp in October but that came at the end of a busy year for him and the closing surge he produced to win a Group Three the previous month was deeply impressive. <br> He got a lot closer to the likes of Victor Ludorum three weeks ago, when he again finished well after being held up out the back in a steadily run race. He comes from the yard of Frederic Rossi, who isn\u2019t well known in Britain but currently tops the trainers table in France. \u201cI\u2019m delighted with the move to a straight track and I think the rhythm of the race will help him,\u201d Rossi has told today\u2019s Post. At 33-1 or bigger, I\u2019d also be interested in <strong>Reshabar</strong>, who has achieved least of today\u2019s field in pure form terms but looks very progressive and unexposed. He\u2019s trained in Germany by Markus Munch, who appears to be a version of Clive Brittain in that he\u2019s happy to turn up in big races with outsiders. Munch\u2019s 50-1 shot Spectre was fourth of 16 in the Queen Anne three years ago. <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed4f2408f084df971c8d7fe\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T12:24:17.636Z\">1.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>There\u2019s some runners from Newmarket in the next race and one thing to consider is that they will have had to travel that 245-mile trip this morning.

Mark Johnston was telling me on Twitter recently that he likes his horses to be at the track at least four hours before they run.

Like many other businesses, we were forced into drastic action, furloughing around 80% of our staff and asking most of our employees to accept temporary salary cuts. These averaged about 25%, but went up to a maximum of 50% for higher earners. This was an enormous sacrifice to ask of our hard-working team and I\u2019m deeply grateful for everything they\u2019ve done to ensure we could survive this devastating period and come back so strongly.

But what is the best tactic to pick a route through the bear-traps as horses, jockeys and trainers try to pick up the threads of the Flat season after nearly three months off? <br><br>Punters have latched on to the tried-and-tested \u201cfirst run for Mick Appleby\u201d system in the opener, which has shown an 18% profit on turnover since the start of 2017 with 30 winners. These include the likes of Merryweather, who won her first start for Appleby in December at 22-1 just a few weeks after leaving Ralph Beckett\u2019s yard as a twice-raced maiden, and has since added two more wins and run well in a Listed race at Deauville, with other winners on debut for the yard at 16-1, 14-1 and 10-1 twice. <br><br>Appleby suggests in this morning\u2019s Racing Post that <strong>Stone Mason</strong> (1.00), a recruit from Roger Charlton\u2019s stable, might need the run, so while many punters are happy to take 6-4 about the four-year-old, there are probably more appealing bets elsewhere and <strong>Ice Pyramid</strong> (5.05) could be the pick of the card. <br><br>Philip Kirby\u2019s gelding put up a career-best to win over track-and-trip in February, travelling smoothly and winning with something to spare in a very good time. He is up another 7lb in the weights but is certainly up to bridging the gap if he is anywhere close to his best and a current price of 7-2 looks generous. <br><br><strong>Little Red Socks </strong>(2.10) knew her job when making a winning debut for Karl Burke in March and has decent prospects of following up at around 7-2, while a step back up to six furlongs could be just what <strong>Heath Charnock </strong>(3.20) needs a couple of races later. <br><br>Simon and Ed Crisford, British racing\u2019s first officially licensed training partnership, will be keen to hit the ground running with <strong>Rock Of Diamonds </strong>(3.55), while Newcastle specialist <strong>Be Proud </strong>(4.30), a dual winner over course-and-distance, is the solid option at around 100-30 in the five-furlong handicap. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed4e80a8f087122eca534c1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T11:36:31.733Z\">12.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Greg Wood has ploughed through the form to bring you tips for today\u2019s resumption card at Newcastle.

There would still have to be at least one steward at the track to make decisions on things like whether it\u2019s safe to race if something goes wrong, so, on a day like this, with just one card, it wouldn\u2019t make much difference. But we have two cards or more per day from tomorrow and a central panel could have ruled over all of it. Evidently, the BHA have decided that these circumstances bring enough challenges without trialling remote stewards.

  "<p>The Japanese art of paper cutting and folding, or kirigami, has led to mind-bending 3D structures from 2D sheets, including spectacular pop-up designs. But now researchers have been getting to grips with the technique for a very down-to-earth reason: creating non-slip shoes.</p> <p>Scientists have revealed they have developed a kirigami-inspired sole, where tiny spikes pop up from its surface as the shoe is bent during walking. The team found the spikes enhance grip, which could help prevent potentially fatal falls.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we are trying to do is augment, or add on, to [existing systems like studs or rubber soles] to have a better grip on slippery surfaces, whether it be ice or whether it be oily surfaces in certain occupations,\u201d said Dr Giovanni Traverso of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US.</p> <p>Traverso added that the kirigami system drew inspiration from friction-enhancing features found in nature, such as the semi-retractable claws of cheetahs that help them chase prey, or the scales on snakes that can be orientated to help them slither along.</p> <p>\u201cThey are dynamic, they are not static structures,\u201d said Traverso. \u201cWalking is a dynamic process so we wanted to develop a system that was also dynamic and could respond to movement.\u201d</p> <p>Writing in the journal <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-020-0564-3\">Nature Biomedical Engineering</a>, the team describe how they applied kirigami techniques to sheets of stainless steel using a laser cutter. After carrying out simulations, the team settled on three different patterns: a regular array of semi-circular cuts, triangular cuts and cuts shaped like curved thorns.</p> <p>The team tested the patches on surfaces including ice, vinyl and hardwood, finding that, on all materials, the various patterned patches, when buckled, increased friction compared with patches of smooth stainless steel, with the curved thorn pattern showing the best performance on ice.</p> <p>Patches of the latter were then fixed to the front half of regular rubber-soled shoes worn by participants. While at rest, the surface of the sole remained flat; however, as the sole of the shoe was buckled when the wearer lifted their heel \u2013 the \u201ctoe-off\u201d stage of a step \u2013 an array of needle-like spikes popped out of the stainless steel patch under the front of the shoe, increasing friction further.</p> <p>Dr Sahab Babaee, first author of the research, said the system offered about 20-35% higher friction than shoes or boots with gripping elements on their soles. \u201cBy adding [dimpling to the sole] and combining with kirigami needles, we expect to observe further friction enhancement, [above] 35%,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Prof Katia Bertoldi, another author of the research from Harvard University, told the Guardian the approach was simple, yet effective. \u201cYou introduce some cuts in a certain way and then you get this behaviour that is so simple but then can also be exploited for some functionality, [that] can help people,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The team say they are now working to develop the patches, adding the work could lead to a whole new type of shoe.</p> <p>\u201cWe see this either as an add-on or it could be incorporated into the sole directly,\u201d said Traverso. \u201cWe hope that [people] can rush out and buy these soon, and that is what we are working towards.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Fears that Iran is in the grip of a second wave of coronavirus have been reinforced, with the health ministry saying 3,000 new cases were recorded in 24 hours \u2013 the highest figure for two months.</p> <p>The Islamic Republic, one of the worst-hit countries in the Middle East, started easing its lockdown in April after a drop in deaths.</p> <p>Its leaders have been reluctant to acknowledge that they may have lifted restrictions prematurely. They have argued that a recent rise in new infections was confined to certain provinces and that the number of deaths was relatively low. At the weekend the president, Hassan Rouhani, said most restrictions had now been lifted, pointing to the opening of 40,000 mosques, as well as shops and offices. Despite a clear reversal of fortunes in the past fortnight, few newspapers appeared willing to acknowledge that the virus had not been conquered.</p> <p>But health ministry officials on Monday sent out a dire warning about complacency, saying the battle was far from over.</p> <p>The health minister, Saeed Namaki, said he was witnessing sad scenes across the country. \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d he said, \u201ccorona is going to score a goal in the 90th minute if some officials and the people believe that corona is over. If we neglect the situation we will go backwards. People, have mercy on us, let\u2019s have mercy on ourselves, government officials are getting tired.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Iran&amp;type=cases\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Iran&type=cases\">Graphic</a> </figure>  <p>The latest figures showed 2,979 new infections in the previous 24 hours, taking the total of infections in Iran to 154,445. The daily figure is the highest since 1 April. The comparative figure for 1 May was 802 new infections.</p> <p>The number of deaths is also starting to rise again, with 81 dead in the previous 24 hours, the highest figure since 27 April. A total of 8,778 have died since Iran\u2019s outbreak began.</p> <p>Namaki said he had been disturbed by the lack of social distancing on public transport. \u201cThe&nbsp;slightest negligence can destroy all successes and tarnish our reputation in the international arena,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Contrary to some messaging by Iran\u2019s leadership that the virus was weakening, he said that it had become more dangerous. \u201cLast week we had cases of patients dying at the age of 32 or 42 without any underlying disease, due to coronavirus,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cMy colleagues and the deputies of the ministry of health are working around the clock and traveling to one province every day to control this epidemic, but we are dealing with local issues and behaviours that could lead to the return of the peak of the disease.\u201d Wedding celebrations, he warned, would turn into funerals soon afterwards. </p> <p>He said the virus was most dangerous in the south-west province of Khuzestan, but infections were also rising in Kermanshah, Hormozgan, Sistan and Baluchestan. The health ministry claimed adherence to social distancing rules had dropped from 90% to 40%, and that promised new buses for Tehran had not materialised, leading to overcrowding. Those not wearing masks on Tehran public transport should be banned from travelling, Namaki said.</p> <p>Experts both at home and abroad have voiced scepticism about&nbsp;Iran\u2018s official figures, saying the real toll could be much higher.</p> <p>Health officials have repeatedly raised the alarm about Khuzestan on&nbsp;Iran\u2019s south-western border with Iraq. Khuzestan remains at red, the highest level on&nbsp;Iran\u2018s colour-coded risk scale, and is the only province where the government has reimposed a lockdown.</p> <p>Iranian authorities have been under intense internal pressure to lift restrictions and get the economy, already shattered by sanctions, back moving. Nearly $2.5bn of damage has been done in 13 sectors of the economy, according to government estimates. Inflation is projected to settle at 24% next year.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a senior Iranian lawmaker said on Monday that around 230 people were killed in the street protests against Iran\u2019s petrol price rises last November.</p> <p>It was the first time Iran had even semi-officially disclosed the scale of the protest. Motjaba Zulmoor, the head of the Iranian parliament\u2019s National Security Commission said 52 of those killed were government officials and the remainder were 78 street protesters mainly killed while attacking government&nbsp;buildings.</p> <p>Zulmoor claimed 2,000 protesters were injured and 5,000 officials, but gave no number for those detained. He blamed foreign media for the wave of attacks, and&nbsp;said the police were forced to intervene when assaults started on police centres.&nbsp;</p> <p>An Iranian government spokesman also attacked Donald Trump for his policing of the current protests against racism and police brutality, saying it showed he had no authority to advise others on human rights issues.</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>On 25 February 1994, the Bundestag sat in extraordinary session in Bonn. Arguments were heated. The chancellor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/16/helmut-kohl-obituary\" title=\"\">Helmut Kohl</a>, chose not to speak; he did, however, toy with the red card used in Germany\u2019s parliament for the casting of no votes. After 70 minutes\u2019 bad-tempered debate, Kohl\u2019s party was defeated, 292 to 223. The project under discussion would go ahead, more than two decades after its inception.</p> <p>As Christo Javacheff, who has died aged 84, liked to point out, it was almost certainly the first time an artwork had gone to parliamentary division. Christo, as he was usually known, had conceived the idea of wrapping the Reichstag more than 20 years previously. The building\u2019s appeal to him lay in its history. It was, as Christo remarked, the only structure in a still-divided Berlin \u201cthat was under the jurisdiction of the Americans, the Soviets, the English, the French and the two Germanys\u201d. Like the artist himself, it sat on a no-man\u2019s land between warring political systems. \u201cTo me, as a Bulgarian refugee who fled communism, east-west relations are very important,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f03aeadba66bf4ff6b7522bb7aaeef44942a1017\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f03aeadba66bf4ff6b7522bb7aaeef44942a1017/0_37_3214_1928/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Gates, 2005, by Christo, in Central Park, New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Gates, 2005, by Christo, in Central Park, New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The once and future German parliament had not been his first choice of wrapped building. In 1961, Christo\u2019s wife and collaborator, Jeanne-Claude (Jeanne-Claude Denat de Guillebon), had suggested he parcel a prison. \u201cIt\u2019s much easier to wrap an art gallery, though,\u201d Christo reasoned, \u201cso we started with the Bern Kunsthalle in 1968.\u201dSy</p> <p>This interaction would be typical of their relationship. Although the couple\u2019s work was initially attributed only to Christo, it had always been, to a degree, four-handed. \u201cIt is also Jeanne-Claude\u2019s,\u201d Christo said of their oeuvre. \u201cAll I do by myself are the drawings.\u201d</p> <p>After 1994, their projects were signed \u201c<a href=\"https://christojeanneclaude.net/\" title=\"\">Christo and Jeanne-Claude</a>\u201d, and their earlier works retroactively catalogued as such. It was a postcard from a friend in Berlin in 1971 that drew their attention to the Reichstag. Christo set about sketching the building the following year, then, in 1975, negotiating with German authorities for its wrapping. In 1977, these plans were turned down, as they were again, with deadening regularity, in 1981 and 1987.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e47d72cc92682a47c70686d3a9b819b274be104\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e47d72cc92682a47c70686d3a9b819b274be104/0_24_5162_3097/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Pont Neuf in Paris, wrapped by Christo in 1985.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Pont Neuf in Paris, wrapped by Christo in 1985.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eye Ubiquitous/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was the support of the former chancellor <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-willy-brandt-1556598.html\" title=\"\">Willy Brandt</a> that gave the couple the will to go on. Shortly after the second refusal, Brandt had climbed the five floors to their studio in an old factory in the SoHo district of New York and knocked on its door. \u201c[He] explained that the project was so important that we should not give up,\u201d Christo recalled. <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-willy-brandt-1556598.html\" title=\"\">Brandt, who died in 1992</a>, did not live to see the fruits of his tenacity.</p> <p><a href=\"https://christojeanneclaude.net/mobile/projects?p=wrapped-reichstag\" title=\"\">Wrapped Reichstag, Berlin</a> (1971-1995), as with all of Christo and Jeanne-Claude\u2019s projects, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/feb/07/how-we-made-the-wrapped-reichstag-berlin-christo-and-jeanne-claude-interview\" title=\"\">was variously epic</a>. It took 26 years to get permission for <a href=\"https://christojeanneclaude.net/projects/the-gates\" title=\"\">The Gates</a> (2005), the 7,503 gates in Central Park, New York, a decade for <a href=\"http://christojeanneclaude.net/projects/the-pont-neuf-wrapped\" title=\"\">The Pont Neuf Wrapped (Paris, 1985)</a>, eight years to be allowed to put up <a href=\"https://christojeanneclaude.net/projects/the-umbrellas?view=info\" title=\"\">3,100 Umbrellas</a>, simultaneously in Japan and California (1991). Each umbrella in this last work was the size of a small house, six metres high by nine wide. The workforce employed in erecting them was 2,500 strong.</p> <p>Wrapped Reichstag would take this taste for big numbers to its apogee. At dawn on 24 June 1995, 90 professional rock-climbers abseiled from the roof of the Reichstag, un furling 100,000 sq metres of aluminised fabric as they went.</p> <p>At a stroke, the hulk built under Wilhelm I was transformed into a piece of classical sculpture, the folds of its new skin like the drapery of a Hellenistic statue. The point of this aesthetic reinvention, in the minds of Christo and Jeanne-Claude, was to put the building back into public ownership. The wrapping of the Reichstag had only been made possible by the support of the people. Christo had visited Germany 50 times between 1971 and 1994, canvassed 350 deputies directly. The Reichstag, he reasoned, was owned not by Kohl but by \u201cthe German nation, by 80 million Germans\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d2c88877c845370b6945897b2519fc08a1d08f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d2c88877c845370b6945897b2519fc08a1d08f3/17_0_3468_2082/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christo stands in front of his work the London Mastaba on the Serpentine in Hyde Park, London, in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christo stands in front of his work the London Mastaba on the Serpentine in Hyde Park, London, in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Dawson/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Much of the meaning of this and other of Christo and Jeanne-Claude\u2019s works lay in the fact that they were too big to fit in a gallery, too expensive to own \u2013 the Reichstag project cost $7m \u2013 and short-lived: like most of their pieces, Wrapped Reichstag was up for just two weeks.</p> <p>These rules were established early on, in works such as <a href=\"https://christojeanneclaude.net/mobile/projects?p=wrapped-coast\" title=\"\">Wrapped Coast</a> (1968-69), in which a million sq ft (92,900 sq metres) of the coastline near Sydney was shrouded in fabric by the Australian Army Corps of Engineers, or <a href=\"https://christojeanneclaude.net/projects/valley-curtain\" title=\"\">Valley Curtain</a> (1970-72), where 99 construction workers and helpers pulled a 19,000 sq-metre orange scrim between two mountains in Colorado. (Thanks to an unseasonal gale, this piece lasted only 28 hours.)</p> <p>For Christo, the more people involved in a project \u2013 rock-climbers, fabric makers, MPs, steeplejacks, soldiers, visitors \u2013 the more democratic it became. It was a point of honour that these works would be seen by large numbers of people \u2013 an estimated 5 million, in the case of Wrapped Reichstag \u2013 and for free. Refusing any form of sponsorship, the couple set up the CVJ Corporation in 1982 to negotiate credit lines directly with banks, with the works themselves as collateral. \u201cI use a capitalist system,\u201d Christo said, happily. \u201cMarxist educated, I understand the capitalist system.\u201d That contradiction lay at the heart of both the man and his work.</p> <p>Born in the small town of Gabrovo in the Bulgarian Balkans, Christo followed a path that seemed predestined. His chemist father, Ivan Javacheff, ran a state fabric factory; his Macedonian mother, Tzveta (nee Dimitrova), was a secretary at the Academy of Fine Arts in Sofia. Their milieu was as progressive as the hardline communism of the People\u2019s Republic of Bulgaria allowed.</p> <p>At 17, their son signed up as a student at the art school where his mother worked; in his four years there, he would be an ardent exponent of Soviet socialist realism. It was only when he left to study theatre design in the Czech capital Prague in 1956 that Christo at last encountered European modernism.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you are young and you discover the relatively small freedom of western art in Czechoslovakia and Prague in the late 1950s, suddenly you dream of going to Paris,\u201d he recalled.</p> <p>Escaping to that city via Vienna in 1957, the now-stateless Christo was asked to paint the wife of an aristocratic French general. Meeting her daughter, Jeanne-Claude, born on precisely the same day as himself, he invited her out, though she was already engaged, to Philipe Planchon. She went through with the marriage to Planchon, but left after three weeks, and the following year, to the deep disapproval of Jeanne-Claude\u2019s parents, she and Christo were married and had a son, Cyril. In 1964, they moved to New York, spending their first three years there as illegal immigrants.</p> <p>In the more than five decades of their collaboration they would complete 22 projects; rather more \u2013 37 \u2013 were still unrealised at the time of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/nov/20/jeanne-claude-christo-obituary\" title=\"\">Jeanne-Claude\u2019s sudden death at the age of 74</a>. Christo persevered in bringing to completion projects left unfinished at that time. One exception was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2017/jan/26/christo-protest-trump-colorado-installation-comment\" title=\"\">Over the River</a>, 15 years in the planning and destined for Arkansas, which Christo cancelled in protest at Donald Trump\u2019s election in 2016.</p> <p>The<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/18/the-london-mastaba-review-christo-serpentine-london-bath-toy\" title=\"\"> London Mastaba</a> \u2013 the flat-topped, 20-metre pyramid of 7,506 red, blue and mauve barrels that appeared on the Serpentine in Hyde Park in 2018 \u2013 had first been conceived in 1962. </p> <p>In that year, too, the pair had set out plans to wrap the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.

Full stops are often pivotal, and sometimes final. Bailey\u2019s Poem is concerned with the symbolic full stop as well as the literal:&nbsp;each stanza meditates on the \u201clast of days\u201d as they occur in the chronology of the speaker\u2019s life, and there is a co-terminal full stop and a new opening sentence for each stanza, until the poem\u2019s last word.&nbsp;</p> <p>I was reminded of the thought recorded by Henry James on suffering a stroke near the end of his life: <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/unbound/flashbks/james/jnote.htm\">\u201cSo here it is at last, the distinguished thing.\u201d</a></p> <p>There is a common sense of expectation \u2013 even, almost, hope - fulfilled. (\u201cSo here it is at last \u2026\u201d) Poem is haunted by the anticipation of dying. It\u2019s a common one, of course: there probably aren\u2019t many writers who fail to rehearse the way their own story will end. It might be one of the psychological essentials for writing, though some (and some literary eras) are more drawn to it than others. Philip Larkin is another death-haunted writer who springs to mind.</p> <p>Bailey brings characteristic humour to his youthful self-portrait: \u201cI cherished the idea of being doomed. / My happiest day was when a stranger said / I looked like Keats.\u201d But death begins a lot earlier for Bailey, as a word temporarily to end all others.&nbsp;He recalls a childhood illness, undergone at a point when he would have been relishing the still-new gift of talk. As a result, \u201cwords absconded from me\u201d: the intrusion of the \u201cdistinguished thing\u201d \u2013 as word, as idea, and personally relevant \u2013 led to a new level of silent thinking. The word sank deep, and changed time itself.</p> <p>Bailey pursues the concept of time given shape by death in his refrain, \u201cMy last of days.\u201d It\u2019s not difficult to understand, and yet it has a mirage-like quality and defies exact interpretation. As it\u2019s repeatedly applied to the different phases of the protagonist\u2019s life it becomes incantation. The preference for the formulation \u201clast of days\u201d over a simple \u201clast day\u201d suggests a finite quantity of days inexorably running out. It diffuses the sense of conclusion over a wider time span: there are days before \u201cthe last of days\u201d that are leading towards it. The contemplation is not simply melancholy: there\u2019s an extended pleasure in it, too. I think this is why the phrase is particularly haunting: it opens an ambiguous space, a space to which any reader of poetry appreciates an invitation. In fact, all the small narratives incorporated into the poem are like that. Readers are given only the simplest of outlines.</p> <p>If we know Bailey\u2019s work well, and have read his biographies, we can of course insert a richer landscape along the way, but it\u2019s not a prerequisite for making imaginative connection with the poem. The clean, plain, prosaic lines of the narrative and the rhetorical, wistful music of the refrain are everything needed.</p> <p>In the penultimate stanza, the focus shifts from the self to the \u201clast of days\u201d of \u201cfriends I loved\u201d. This \u201cabundance\u201d of mourning sharpens the reality and finality of death, and makes a bridge of feeling to the new self-perception of the terse last stanza. \u201cMy last of days is getting closer now. / I fear I have to welcome it.\u201d</p> <p>The expression \u201cI fear\u201d may signal a typically English understatement, as if the writer really wanted to say, apologetically but perhaps with wry amusement, something like: \u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t admit this, but I\u2019m afraid I welcome my last of days.\u201d On the other hand \u201cI fear\u201d may signal simply that: fear. This doesn\u2019t cancel out the positive aspect of \u201cwelcome\u201d but suggests obligation.&nbsp;There\u2019s an unnerving, but perhaps faintly bracing, absence of choice regarding the last full stop.</p> <p>One further, happier thought: this is a new poem, written since Inheritance was published, and it\u2019s among Bailey\u2019s best.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>",
  "<p>As the United States responds to the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s (CCP) brazen crackdown on Hong Kong, it is hard to imagine a US president with less credibility than Donald Trump - who just this week <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1266231100780744704\">threatened</a> violence against US citizens protesting police brutality and racism - to respond effectively to the CCP\u2019s dangerous infringement on the rights of the people of Hong Kong.</p> <p>The rising tensions over Hong Kong are a window into the future of the US-China relationship \u2013 the challenges posed by the Chinese Communist party (CCP), the stakes at play, and how dangerous it is when the United States lacks an effective approach.&nbsp;</p> <p>After the \u201chandover\u201d in 1997, the people of Hong Kong were promised at least 50 years of self-rule and a democratic system of government; the CCP has encroached on Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy ever since. Major protests \u2013 including in 2014 and last year \u2013 have been sparked not only by acts of repression by the CCP, but also more recently by the fear that time is running out for Hong Kong.&nbsp;</p> <p>A new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/china-vote-npc-national-security-laws-hong-kong-us-protest\">law</a> approved by the Chinese mainland\u2019s national people\u2019s congress makes those fears more real than ever. The CCP argues that the inability of the Hong Kong government to deal with protests means that Beijing must step in, a move that violates the promise of separate political systems. The new law authorizes arrests for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-52762291\">vague</a> transgressions such as \u201ctreason\u201d, \u201csedition\u201d and \u201csubversion\u201d, raising fears that anyone deemed an opponent of the CCP could be arrested. The law also authorizes the CCP\u2019s security services to operate openly in Hong Kong, formally extending the power of the Chinese security state to Hong Kong.&nbsp;</p> <p>The CCP views the protests in Hong Kong as a direct threat to the CCP\u2019s autocratic system, and influencing the CCP on this is difficult. But the CCP watches closely for the reactions of the rest of the world, in particular the US. Trump has generally made it clear that he couldn\u2019t care less what happens in Hong Kong. At the height of the protests last year, Trump <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/03/politics/trump-biden-call-xi-secure-server/index.html\">reportedly</a> told the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, that he would stay quiet about Hong Kong in order to facilitate a trade deal. In public remarks Trump has <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-02/trump-calls-hong-kong-protests-riots-adopting-china-rhetoric\">called</a> the protests \u201criots\u201d and said they are China\u2019s business to handle.&nbsp;</p> <p>The US Congress, however, responded to last year\u2019s events by passing the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1838/text\">Act</a>, which Trump was forced to sign. That law requires the US secretary of state to certify every year that Hong Kong remains autonomous, which is a precondition for the US to continue its preferential economic relationship with Hong Kong. On Wednesday, in response to the CCP\u2019s latest move, the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/prc-national-peoples-congress-proposal-on-hong-kong-national-security-legislation/\">notified</a> Congress that Hong Kong was not autonomous from the mainland.&nbsp;</p> <p>Pompeo\u2019s certification gives the president and secretary of state the ability to impose consequences ranging from sanctions to a complete change in the US-Hong Kong economic relationship. The stakes couldn\u2019t be higher: Hong Kong\u2019s precarious position as a relatively free, democratic society and a global financial hub are dependent on its special treatment by the United States and the international community. If those relationships change, then Hong Kong, US-China relations and the global financial system will change too.&nbsp;</p> <p>Threatening to change the US relationship with Hong Kong could, conceivably, deter the CCP from further crackdowns, because the CCP benefits financially from Hong Kong\u2019s unique economic status. But if the US upends Hong Kong\u2019s special status, it could help seal the fate of the people of Hong Kong as just another part of the CCP\u2019s autocratic domain. The US cannot do that.&nbsp;</p> <p>The CCP\u2019s actions are not taking place in a vacuum \u2013 they are illustrative of the broader challenges the CCP poses to the world, and the dilemmas it presents for the US. As tensions rise, and the CCP uses the cover of the global pandemic to aggressively pursue territorial claims from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/china-and-india-move-troops-as-border-tensions-escalate\">India</a> to the South China <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/International-relations/New-South-China-Sea-tensions-rattle-Manila-and-Hanoi-amid-pandemic\">Sea</a>, the range of threats is only growing.&nbsp;</p> <p>Trump\u2019s erratic policies have only made matters worse. His trade war hurts the American economy. His lack of interest in human rights has removed potential deterrents against the CCP\u2019s campaign of ethnic cleansing in Xinjiang and repression in Hong Kong. Trump\u2019s undermining of US alliances and withdrawal from leadership in international organizations has ceded the global playing field to China. The list goes on.&nbsp;</p> <p>As the US develops strategies to confront the challenges posed by the CCP, we will need to embrace policy approaches that Trump has abandoned. That will mean standing up for values, investing in the American economy, working with allies, and strengthening international institutions.&nbsp;</p> <p>When it comes to standing up for Hong Kong today, the US must respond to the passage of the new law with immediate diplomatic pressure. It also needs to send clear public and private <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/security/reports/2019/09/16/474577/support-democracy-human-rights-asia/\">signals</a> about the measures that the US will take if Beijing follows through with a crackdown on Hong Kong \u2013&nbsp;including targeted sanctions against the officials, security services and companies involved</p> <p>To bring international pressure against the CCP, the US must also put Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy on the agenda of international organizations from the United Nations to the G7.&nbsp;</p> <p>The US must closely coordinate with its allies, in particular the United Kingdom, which has a special role to play as the signatory to the Sino-British Joint Declaration that outlined the terms of Hong Kong\u2019s handover to China. The US has taken a first step in this direction with a joint US-UK-Canada-Australia <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CBCAlerts/status/1265974905268469763\">statement</a> condemning the CCP\u2019s move.&nbsp;</p> <p>The situation also requires consulting with and following the lead of those on the ground in Hong Kong fighting for their rights. The US must ensure that its actions do everything possible to help the people of Hong Kong rather than sacrificing Hong Kong to make a larger point about the CCP.&nbsp;</p> <p>Perhaps most importantly, effectively standing up for values abroad requires upholding universal values at home. The Trump administration\u2019s endless assaults on America\u2019s democratic institutions - of which Trump\u2019s threat of violence against Americans is just the most recent shocking illustration - erodes America\u2019s ability to credibly pressure the CCP over its own human rights abuses.</p> <p>Right now, the people of Hong Kong and the US and people across the world need strong, principled American leadership to deal with the challenges posed by the CCP. Three and a half years of Trump\u2019s counterproductive policies \u2013 which the CCP have taken advantage of \u2013 have only made that US leadership more necessary than ever.</p>",

  "<p>The air is clean and fresh, fish have reappeared in urban waterways, birds are frequenting uncut gardens, wild mammals are meandering through cities and greenhouse gas emissions will likely drop by an unprecedented<a href=\"https://www.iea.org/news/global-energy-demand-to-plunge-this-year-as-a-result-of-the-biggest-shock-since-the-second-world-war\"> 8% this year</a>. Nature has clearly benefited from several months of dramatically reduced economic activity. From a climate crisis perspective, this drop in emissions is astonishingly close to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/26/united-nations-global-effort-cut-emissions-stop-climate-chaos-2030\">7.6% yearly reduction</a> in emissions that scientists have advised will be necessary during the next decade. And yet none of this is cause for celebration.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Most surprising are the carbon-intensive industries that confirm they are continuing to decarbonise despite the pandemic</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The resilience of nature is temporary, and will last only as long as the lockdown is enforced. More importantly, the reduction in greenhouse gases is not the result of decarbonising the economy, but the unintended consequence of economic paralysis that has come with painful human consequences and huge costs to lives and livelihoods. This is not what addressing the climate crisis looks like. The thoughtful reduction of greenhouse gases has to be intentional not circumstantial, sustained not temporary. Above all, it must lead to improved human wellbeing, not to human or economic suffering.&nbsp;</p> <p>There is a second inadvertent link between climate crisis and the coronavirus pandemic that is perhaps less examined. The recovery packages designed and implemented by governments to rescue the ailing global economy could rise as high as $20tn over the next 18 months. The scale of this stimulus will shape the contours of the global economy over the next decade, if not longer. This is precisely the decade when climate scientists have warned global emissions will need to be cut by half in order to reach a sustainable trajectory. In the midst of the crisis wreaked by the pandemic is an opportunity: to ensure rescue packages don\u2019t merely recover the high carbon economy of yesterday, but help us build a healthier economy that is low on carbon, high in resilience and centred on human wellbeing.</p> <p>The case for rebuilding our economies in line with environmental targets has broad public support. A<a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/two-thirds-britons-believe-climate-change-serious-coronavirus-and-majority-want-climate-prioritised\"> recent poll</a> from Ipsos Mori shows that 71% of the global population understands that climate change is as at least as serious a crisis as Covid-19, and 65% think the former should be prioritised in the economic recovery.

  "<p>When coronavirus crept across the world in early February, talk of how different nations were dealing with the virus came to resemble the Olympics for state capacity. Which country had the authority, the supplies and the expertise to \u201ccrush the curve\u201d? A balance sheet of national progress marked out a bleak race to the horizon, enumerated in case numbers and death figures.</p> <p>Although the focus over recent months has remained on leaders in crisis mode and the central agencies delivering forecasts and quarantine measures, local authorities have also played a prominent role during the pandemic. Chinese mayors, US governors and Indian chief ministers have coordinated local responses, taking responsibility for populations and even <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-28/alcohol-spat-shows-india-states-battling-modi-for-virus-billions\">locking horns</a> with national politicians.</p> <p>Most people would read the pandemic as a sign that populations and nation states should band together, and<strong> </strong>for the people \u201cat the head of the rope\u201d to pull even harder, to use the metaphor favoured by the French president, Emmanuel Macron. But there are others who see matters quite differently. They spy opportunity in the crisis, and wager that we might be able to ride the wave of the pandemic into a new tomorrow, where the virus shatters the global map \u2013 and undermines the power of democratic nation states.</p> <p>The US is ground zero for this type of thinking. Across the country, regions have broken up into \u201ccompacts\u201d, with states competing against each other for life-saving ventilators and PPE. The atmosphere is one of competitive federalism, where states are reconfigured as economic units bidding in a marketplace. Washington\u2019s state governor, Jay Inslee, accused Trump<strong> </strong>of<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/jay-inslee-trump-twitter-coronavirus-washington-liberate-america-a9471681.html\"> \u201cfomenting domestic rebellion\u201d</a> for his calls to \u201cliberate\u201d individual states; governor Gavin Newsom termed California a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/us/california-coronavirus-newsom-nation-state.html\">\u201cnation-state.\u201d</a> One Maryland governor confessed to keeping Covid-19 <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/495519-maryland-governor-says-coronavirus-tests-acquired-from-south-korea-under\">tests in an undisclosed location under armed guard</a>, in part to prevent their seizure by central state authorities.</p> <p>Although North America\u2019s economy is gradually reopening, the virus is still rampaging through its population. What will economic recovery look like in the midst of a pandemic? The president\u2019s economic advisers have some ideas. In an <a href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1162126/2020_04_28_When_and_Where_Will_the_Recovery_Happen_ID_ee44b445dd92.pdf?p=pdf\">analysis</a> released at the end of April, Arthur Laffer and Stephen Moore, two of Trump\u2019s closest economic confidants and authors of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/09/trumponomics-trump-reaganism-authoritarian-wall-street-main-street\">the book on \u201cTrumponomics\u201d</a>, predicted that \u201cblue\u201d Democratic states would be slower than \u201cred\u201d states to recover, because of what they saw as their pre-existing excess of regulations and taxes.</p> <p>Their analysis divided the US map into <a href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1162126/2020_04_28_When_and_Where_Will_the_Recovery_Happen_ID_ee44b445dd92.pdf?p=pdf\">\u201claggard anti-growth\u201d states and \u201cmomentum pro-growth\u201d</a> states. The former have minimum wages, pro-union laws and state income tax; the latter are free of such regulations.<strong> </strong>In the established mode of disaster capitalism, Laffer and Moore\u2019s analysis appears to see the pandemic as a way to compel \u201canti-growth\u201d states to adopt ever lower tax rates in order to attract mobile capital and labour. It suggests those who resist will not be bailed out by redistribution from the central government, but left to languish in a deserved economic depression. The effect is reminiscent of social Darwinism, applied as a philosophy of government.</p> <p>The most articulate cheerleader for this kind of post-pandemic libertarianism is Balaji Srinivasan, the electrical engineer and former general partner at Silicon Valley venture capital fund Andreesen Horowitz. Since the pandemic began, Srinivasan has foretold a redivision of the world map into \u201cgreen zones\u201d that have controlled and contained the virus and \u201cred zones\u201d, which have not.</p> <p>\u201cWe are entering this fractal environment,\u201d Srinivasan <a href=\"https://hopin.to/events/virtual-startup-societies-summit-special-jurisdictions-in-a-post-covid-world\">recently</a> told a virtual summit organised by the Startup Societies Foundation, \u201cin which the virus breaks centralised states\u201d. The virus does not stop at the border, so nor will this process of fragmentation. As regions seal themselves off to prevent contagion, \u201cyou can drill down to the state, or even the town or county level\u201d, Srinivasan observed, noting that any state without the virus under control will \u201cface defection\u201d in an intensified contest for talent and capital. After the pandemic has passed, \u201cnations are going to turn into effectively vendors and entrepreneurs and relatively mobile people will be applicants\u201d, he predicted.</p> <p>It\u2019s easy to imagine how a particular breed of investor could see this pandemic as an opportunity that will accelerate existing trends. The loose attachments that investors feel towards this or that nation will grow even looser as capital becomes more mobile, and a sorting process will separate the productive few nations from the malingering many. States that don\u2019t fall in line with the demands of this investor class will be starved by the voluntary expatriation of the wealthy, with their assets and abilities in tow.</p> <p>If you assume this is merely a pessimistic vision, you\u2019d be wrong. In fact it accords with a long-cultivated ideology that Srinivasan shares with a group of like-minded venture capitalists and entrepreneurs, who subscribe to variations of the radical libertarian philosophy known as \u201canarcho-capitalism\u201d. The idea at its root is that a wealthy class of investors and entrepreneurs should be free to exit nation states and form new communities whose members can choose which rules (and tax laws) they\u2019re governed by \u2013 as if those rules were products on a store shelf. </p> <p>For like-minded libertarians, the colour-coded zones used in public health to control the virus are the blueprint for a new political economy. Since Srinivasan began discussing the framework, colour-coded zones have been rolled out to control the virus in Malaysia, Indonesia, Northern Italy and France; the strategy was also considered as a model for biocontainment <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/07/kushner-coronavirus-surveillance-174165\">in the White House</a> in early April. As of early May, India has divided its 1.3 billion people into a patchwork of green, yellow and red zones, with different freedoms and restrictions based on each.</p> <p>The red-green zone schema has already informed the strategies of global investors. In April, Henley &amp; Partners, the global citizenship broker, released its annual ranking of national passports for mobile investors, and predicted that coronavirus would spark a dramatic shift in global mobility. Its chief source <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/ae/news-releases/record-breaking-global-mobility-grounded-by-covid-19-pandemic-301034963.html\">forecast</a> that \u201cas the curtain lifts, people will seek to move from poorly governed and ill-prepared \u2018red zones\u2019 to \u2018green zones\u2019, or places with better medical care.\u201d In early May, it <a href=\"https://robbreport.com/travel/destinations/super-rich-buying-pandemic-passports-multiple-nationalities-2918500/\">reported</a> a 42% increase in applications for new nationalities, compared with the previous year.</p> <p>Nobody can tell what the world will look like after the pandemic. But what we can be sure of is that some investors appear to be already placing<strong> </strong>their bets on a vision of the future where the wealthy are freed from tax constraints. As nations are divided into different zones according to their respective stages of viral and economic recovery, the well-off could follow Elon Musk\u2019s recent threat to relocate from California to Texas, voting with their feet for locations that elude redistributive taxation. In our post-pandemic future, the flight to safety, away from contagious \u201cred zones\u201d, could be a flight from the nation state as we know it.</p> <p>\u2022 Quinn Slobodian is an associate professor of history at Wellesley College, US&nbsp;</p>",

There are hundreds of thousands of [these] children across the region, known as <em>almajirai</em>. They live away from home and the outcomes for these children are very poor; they often end up begging on the street.\u201d</p> <p>The sudden closure of schools put many children in danger by sending them on long unaccompanied journeys home, says Brooks.</p> <p>\u201cWhen [the schools] were closed suddenly children were roaming around trying to get home \u2026 Over 7,000 moved just from Nigeria to Niger; [we think] about 30,000 of them are on the move.

It also said it was not responsible for the&nbsp;transfer of detainees to and from the facility. </p> <p>In its defence filed to the court, G4S admitted it owed Potter a duty of care as his employer. But it also says that at the relevant time, the centre was under the control of an administrator appointed by the PNG minister for foreign affairs and immigration. G4S denied that it was liable to the commonwealth government&nbsp;for indemnity, contribution or damages. It denied Potter\u2019s injuries were caused by G4S negligence.</p> <p>The then immigration minister, Scott Morrison, told reporters on the second night of the riots that it was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/18/scott-morrison-australia-will-not-change-policy-on-asylum-seekers\">\u201cdistressing&nbsp;situation&nbsp;but it is&nbsp;not a situation,&nbsp;sadly, that was not anticipated\u201d</a>, comments Tobin referred to in his opening address on Monday.</p> <p>The defence is expected to give its opening address later on Monday or on Tuesday. The hearing continues.</p>",
  "<p>By settling on an August start to its coronavirus-delayed season, Super Netball, the world\u2019s premier netball league, has given itself the best possible chance of putting fans in the stands come finals time.</p> <p>On Sunday, league bosses announced the 2020 season \u2013 which was due to begin in May and conclude in late August \u2013 will start on 1 August and feature a full fixture of 60 games, including four finals, expected to be played in mid-to-late November.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/21/financial-concerns-and-rule-changes-as-netball-prepares-for-re-entry-into-crowded-market\">Extra-time, rolling subs: netball vies for new attention of hearts and minds | Megan Maurice</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Netball Australia also revealed plans for the international calendar, confirming the trans-Tasman Constellation Cup will follow the season, but not the Quad Series, which has been called off.</p> <p>It comes after the UK\u2019s top-level competition, the Superleague, was last week cancelled entirely&nbsp;because of the pandemic.</p> <p>New Zealand\u2019s ANZ Premiership, which managed one round in March pre-shutdown, will re-start a revised competition on 19 June, with matches played every Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday in one location in Auckland and without crowds. The top teams will play in a grand final on 23 August.</p> <p>In Australia, Super Netball\u2019s eight teams have been given the green light to train together from Monday, following state-specific distancing rules.</p> <p>Super Netball chief executive Chris Symington says players will continue to be paid as per the current agreement of 12 hours per week, \u201cwith full pre-season training earmarked for late June, where athletes will return to their normal 23 hours of training a week\u201d. Then, it\u2019s game on, with matches to be broadcast on Channel 9 and app.</p> <p>There is no fixture yet, but with the West Coast Fever, Adelaide Thunderbirds, Queensland Firebirds and Sunshine Coast Lightning based in the closed-border states of Western and South Australia and Queensland respectively, there are some significant challenges.</p> <p>Insiders say the league looked at an eastern states hub model, even going so far as surveying clubs, but decided it was too costly.</p> <p>It is believed the Thunderbirds, Fever, Firebirds and Lightning may play several games in a row in New South Wales and Victoria when the season begins, to avoid quarantine issues. As with other sporting leagues, when borders open will be central to how the season unfolds.</p> <p>Commentator&nbsp;and Fever specialist coach Sue Gaudion says league administrators are being \u201cconservative in a smart way\u201d by not rushing back, especially if it means crowds are a chance.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone wants to get back on the court and there has been frustration behind the scenes, but fans in the stands \u2026 if we can give ourselves the best possible chance for that, that\u2019s amazing,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201c[Playing in front of a crowd] is why you play the game. For the players, it\u2019s not just about themselves. The fans that support them week in and week out, they matter so much and crowds take the game to another level, in the stadium and on the broadcast. Everyone in the sport is desperate to see crowds.\u201d</p> <p>While it\u2019s impossible to know if spectators may be allowed come November, starting in August gives a \u201cbloody exciting\u201d glimmer of hope, Gaudion says.</p> <p>Another flicker of excitement is the prospect of Kiwi stars, who will finish their league in late August, joining Super Netball as injury replacements; a ploy masterfully exploited by 2019 premiers, the NSW Swifts.</p> <p>Even with the coronavirus crisis presenting a financial challenge, Gaudion say coaches\u2019 eyes will look across the Tasman if they need to replace a top player.</p> <p>\u201cThe pandemic situation doesn\u2019t change a coach\u2019s mentality, they\u2019re in it to win it. And while you never want injuries, rest assured they will be looking for the best, even if they get push back.\u201d</p> <p>Having waited decades, netball fans are uniquely qualified to play the long game. And with or without extra imports, the 2020 season \u2013 if it is completed without being compromised and if it features spectators \u2013 could be another watershed moment in netball\u2019s long and winding road to professionalism and prominence. </p>"
