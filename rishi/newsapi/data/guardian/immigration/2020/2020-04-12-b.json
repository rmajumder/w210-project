The Associated Press reports:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Long before there was a global coronavirus pandemic, brick-and-mortar retailers struggled to get people to walk through their doors instead of shopping online.</p> <p>Now those retailers are faced with an even more Herculean task: how to stay on people\u2019s minds and more importantly their pocketbooks when many of their store doors are closed.</p> <p>More than 250,000 stores like Macy\u2019s, Nordstrom and Nike that sell non-essential merchandise have temporarily shuttered since mid-March in response to the pandemic. Thats 60% of overall U.S. retail square footage, according to Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail.</p> <p>\u201cRetail has hung a closed sign on the door literally and metaphorically,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cThis is the most catastrophic crisis that retail has faced worse than the financial crisis in 2008, worse than 9/11. Almost overnight, the retail economy shifted from being about things people want to things that they need.\u201d</p> <p>Some retailers have responded to the challenge by coming up with creative ways to stay relevant. Nike, for instance, introduced workout apps in China when the coronavirus first surfaced there, resulting in an 80% increase in users within the quarter and a 30% increase in online sales. It\u2019s now pushing a similar campaign in the U.S. and Europe.</p> <p>Yoga pants maker Lululemon is holding online classes in North America and Europe after gaining thousands of new followers in China on WeChat. Lululemon CEO Calvin McDonald told analysts during a recent call that during its first week of closures in the U.S., it saw nearly 170,000 customers join Lululemon for its live classes.</p> <p>Small businesses are also pivoting in order to hold onto customers. Camp, a new toy chain that set itself apart from online retailers by doubling down on the physical experience, is hosting virtual birthday parties and creating curated gift boxes now that its five stores have gone dark. Politics &amp; Prose, a popular Washington D.C. bookstore, was also forced to temporarily close and is now starting to stream author talks online and offering a curbside pickup service.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e9395128f082dfd549d5368\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-12T22:31:48.406Z\">11.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, has outlined his plan to safely reopen the United States in an op-ed <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/opinion/joe-biden-coronavirus-reopen-america.html\">published in today\u2019s New York Times</a>. </p> <p>His three steps include: 1) getting the number of new cases down significantly through continued social distancing and improved supply lines to our hospitals with a more thorough deployment of the Defense Production Act; 2) the establishment of widespread, easily available and prompt testing with contact tracing strategy that protects privacy; and 3) increasing the capacity of our healthcare system to protect against the potential flare-up of cases when economic activity reopens.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cFor more Americans to go back to their jobs, the president needs to do better at his job,\u201d Biden wrote. </p> <p>As if Trump, the great counterpuncher, was going to take that lying down.

coronavirus tsar Peter Navarro, about whom Julian Borger, our world affairs editor, wrote <a

southern hemisphere experiences in the virus might teach us about the seasonality or otherwise of Covid-19, Dr Nabarro offered a disturbing thought: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We think <strong>it is going to be a virus that stalks the human race for quite a long time</strong> to come until we can all have a vaccine that will protect us and that there will be small outbreaks that will emerge sporadically and they will break through our defenses.</p> </blockquote> <p>Nabarro was also asked about Donald Trump\u2019s criticism of the WHO and his threat this week \u2013 how serious he was was, as ever, unclear \u2013 to withdraw US funding for the international healthcare body:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The World Health Organization actually works on behalf of all the governments in the world. And it operates within mandates that are given to it. And, and we have to rely on information that\u2019s received from different governments. And that then permits us to work out what\u2019s going on \u2026 but <strong>we know that there will be many things that are found to have perhaps not been done as well as they could have been done</strong>. And we\u2019re anticipating there\u2019ll be lots of examinations afterwards. </p> <p>Right now, we have to move forward. We have to get the best possible cooperation. I just heard you discussing with the head of the FDA some of the challenges, the things that we\u2019re learning about this virus all the time. That\u2019s why we need a strong WHO, a trusted WHO. And we hope all leaders will continue to work with us in that way.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Meet the Press Chuck Todd asked</strong> that given <strong>\u201c</strong>the United States is anywhere \u2013 approximately 15% to 20% of your annual budget \u2026 how devastating would it be if the United States pulled its funding?\u201d</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, you know, <strong>we\u2019re right in the middle of this massive epic struggle. Every single human being in the world is affected by it</strong>. Businesses are really in trouble. Communities are in distress. I really do hope that all nations will not find any reason to make threats or other such things that will undermine our capacity to bring together all the best knowledge that we can find. </p> <p>\u201cAnd of course we love our partnership with the United States. We work with United States scientists for years \u2026 and <strong>that would be so unfortunate if anything happened to lessen that cooperation</strong>. </p> <p>\u201cI know that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/tedros-adhanom\"><strong>Tedros [Adhanom Ghebreyesus], the director general</strong></a>, has had direct discussions with the president of the US.

Last week, the Trump announced he would establish a bipartisan \u201cOpening Our Country Council\u201d to weigh in on issue.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of very smart people, a lot of professionals, doctors and business leaders are a lot of things that go into a decision like that,\u201d he told Pirro. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to be based on a lot of facts and a lot of instinct also. Whether we like it or not, there is a certain instinct to it.</p> <p>The council, Trump added, would include \u201csome of the most distinguished leaders in virtually every field, including politics and business and medical. And we\u2019ll be making that decision fairly soon.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s phone-in came ahead of an early morning tweet on Sunday in which he attacked <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-response.html\"><strong>a New York Times report</strong></a> which said the White House failed to act on several explicit security agency warnings in January about the potential for coronavirus to spread to the US.</p> <p>\u201cSo now the Fake News is tracing the CoronaVirus origins back to Europe, NOT China. This is a first! I wonder what the Failing New York Times got for this one? Are there any NAMED sources? They were recently thrown out of China like dogs, and obviously want back in. Sad!\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s interpretation of the report appeared to misconstrue scientific evidence that the spread of coronavirus to the Eastern US came through Europe \u2013 but not that it originated there.</p> <p>The claim comes despite evidence that trade adviser Peter Navarro warned Trump in 29 January <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/us/politics/navarro-warning-trump-coronavirus.html\">memo</a> that as many as 500,000 Americans could die if the virus was allowed to spread across the US unchecked. A day later, health and human services secretary Alex Azar issued a similar warning. The White House did not issue national social distancing guidelines until 16 March. </p> <p>On Saturday, Trump vowed to rebuild the US economy, which has suffered trillions of dollars in damage from the outbreak, as a tribute to those who have died. Trump predicted that the economy to rebound like a \u201crocket ship\u201d because Americans have combated the coronavirus the \u201cright way\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe did it the right way. We took care of social distancing and all of the things, words that nobody ever heard before, frankly, and phrases. But if we didn\u2019t do that, we would have pulled through it,\u201d Trump said. </p> <p>\u201cThere were estimates, 2.2 million people. Well, if you cut that in more than half and you said a million and cut that in half.

The 28-year-old German is the defending champion here at Augusta, and went into the Tournament full of confidence (and the wiener schnitzel he served up at the Champions Dinner). He\u2019s living up to his billing, bouncing back from a disappointing opening round of 74 with a 68-69 salvo. He\u2019s right in the mix, hoping to become only the second player after Jack Nicklaus (1965 and 1966) to successfully defend his Masters title. Who can stop him?</p> <p><strong>How about the new world number two?</strong> Seve Ballesteros already has two green jackets to his name, and he\u2019s in the mood to win a third. Specifically, he in a <em>bad</em> mood: he\u2019s been raging all week at PGA Tour commissioner Deane Beman, who has banished him from the American tour for a year, on account of not playing enough golf to earn his card. (To be fair to Seve, his volatile volleys at Beman aren\u2019t a patch on those sent down by Mac O\u2019Grady, who has called Beman a \u201cthief with a capital T\u201d and compared him to Adolf Hitler!) But there\u2019s no keeping Seve from Augusta, and he\u2019s desperate to make a told-you-so statement. He\u2019s one off the lead after three rounds.</p> <p><strong>Or is the Great White Shark about to land his first major? </strong>Greg Norman, only ranked six in the world but surely on an upwardly mobile journey that\u2019ll take the man from down under straight to the top, leads at the 54-hole mark after a fine 68 yesterday.</p> <p><strong>And then there\u2019s Nick Price. </strong>The young Zimbabwean, who came so close to winning the Open Championship four years ago, broke the course record at Augusta National yesterday. He made ten birdies on his way to 63, very nearly becoming the first man to shoot 62 in a major; sadly his 20-footer on 18 looped the loop in slow motion and failed to drop. Millimetres from history. He\u2019ll be a bit higher than #52 in the world next week.</p> <p><strong>Also lurking: </strong>the resurgent Tom Watson (#4) coming out of a two-year slump; the reigning Open champion Sandy Lyle (#3) whose big drives and draws are perfectly suited to this course; Tom Kite (#16) who has finished in the top ten at Augusta nine times in the last 11 years; Donnie Hammond (#99) who won his first PGA Tour event, the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, at La Quinta in California earlier this year; and Tommy Nakajima (#7) who has been clocking up wins on the Japanese tour for fun (21 in the last four years).</p> <p><strong>But maybe it\u2019s going to be a step too far for 46-year-old Jack Nicklaus, and not just because he\u2019s got four shots to make up on Norman.</strong> Nicklaus has won only twice since 1980, his powers seemingly very much on the wane: he was in contention for three PGA Tour tournaments last season, but couldn\u2019t convert any of those good positions into a win. Most unlike the Golden Bear. For the record, Jack is world number 33, though to be fair, had the R&amp;A been cobbling together these rankings back in the sixties and seventies, he might have spent the odd week or two at the toppermost of the poppermost.</p> <p><strong>After the third round, the top of the leader board looked like this: </strong></p> <p><strong><em>-6: </em></strong><em>Greg Norman<br> <strong>-5: </strong>Seve Ballesteros, Bernhard Langer, Donnie Hammond, Nick Price<br> <strong>-4: </strong>Tommy Nakajima, Tom Kite, Tom Watson<br> <strong>-2: </strong>Danny Edwards, Gary Koch, Sandy Lyle, Mark McCumber, Jack Nicklaus, Corey Pavin, Bob Tway</em></p> <p><strong>The weather today is utterly gorgeous, perfect conditions for golf. </strong>Sunny, but not too blistering, and very little wind.

This is particularly true in the family court, says the Law Council of Australia president Pauline Wright.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I am hearing across the profession is that many people are trying really hard now to settle matters without the need for waiting for a hearing,\u201d Wright says. \u201cIt means that the people affected by family law disputes are actually coming together to agree more often than would ordinarily be the case. So this pandemic has done some good in bringing people together in that sense.\u201d</p> <p>Wright says lawyers may argue for some changes \u2013 such as an increased accommodation for telephone or video hearings \u2013 to remain in place after the crisis is over, because they save lawyers\u2019 time and therefore their clients\u2019 money.</p> <p>\u201cIf I go from my office to the local court it will take me 40 minutes to get there but while I am there I might be waiting for another 40 minutes or an hour before my client\u2019s matter gets heard, and it might be a five-minute matter,\u201d she says.</p> <p>But Wright says other changes, like a decision in Victoria to give priority to judge-only trials, should not continue after restrictions are lifted.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to see changes brought into place just for the sake of efficiency, because efficiency does not mean fairness or justice,\u201d she says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Some people may emerge from the pandemic with a loathing for working from home, and companies will have to adjust</p> <footer> <cite>Alex Prineas</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Pharmacy Guild has also argued that the six-month extension of the continued dispensing of emergency medicines scheme should continue after the crisis.

  "<p>In the spring of 1963, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference was engaged in a campaign to defeat Jim Crow laws in Birmingham, Alabama.</p> <p>As they approached the Easter weekend that year, no victory was in sight. But Dr Martin Luther King Jr knew there was something in the logic of Easter that suggested the way to victory might be counterintuitive. He decided to go to jail on Good Friday and stay there through the Easter weekend. He would not be free to preach a sermon on the holiest day of the Christian year, but he would pen his famous Letter from a Birmingham Jail as he waited to see a way forward.</p> <p>In the midst of this world\u2019s deepest darkness, the Christian story of the resurrection points towards the power of hope. As we weather a global pandemic, Easter offers a moment for us to reflect on the role of suffering and the possibility of radical solidarity.</p> <p>Over the past month we have entered a new reality where despair is ever-present and fear pervasive. The death toll keeps rising, and instead of honest leadership we have a president who uses press conferences as political rallies. Trump might remind us of Pontius Pilate, who came from a well-known family and oversaw a tense, violent relationship with the Jewish minority of Jesus\u2019 day. America today is not unlike the Roman Empire in which Christ was crucified as an insubordinate revolutionary.</p> <p>Suffering is not anathema to Christians. In the Christian story, Jesus \u2013 the son of the creator of the universe \u2013 willingly undergoes a painful, bloody, public death. It is the last sacrifice, so that others do not need to continue the bloodletting. This is an astounding idea, a reversal of all our dominant values, our hunger for immortality, for power, for pleasure above all else. The crucifixion is the story of Jesus\u2019 ultimate sacrifice and solidarity with the world.</p> <p>But the story does not end with death. It ends with resurrection, an unbelievable miracle, and with the Holy Spirit persisting in a global community.</p> <p>Can we come together as a global community today? As we take hope in the Easter story, we must also take the lessons of Christ\u2019s life, which was spent in radical communion with the poor and sick.</p> <p>The Poor People\u2019s Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival has taken up the campaign begun by Martin Luther King Jr and others in 1968, which was itself a revival of the early church\u2019s commitment to the least of these. We stand for the 140 million poor and low-income people who were left out of Congress\u2019s Covid-19 relief package: the 60 million workers who do not have paid sick leave, the 25 million with no health insurance, the 72 million who already have medical debt, the 8 million to 11 million people who are homeless, the 11 million undocumented immigrants who will receive no support. Often, in the midst of America\u2019s obsession with the middle class, we forget those who have nothing. But Christ did not forget them.</p> <p>And, as we seek solutions to this virus at home, we must remember its global reach. India\u2019s 1.3 billion people are all in a 21-day lockdown. In Africa, the difficulty of social distancing in dense areas, paired with underlying conditions caused by malnutrition, could portend a devastating toll. As developing countries become harder hit, people are faced with the choice of infection or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/03/we-will-starve-zimbabwes-poor-full-of-misgiving-over-covid-19-lockdown\">starvation</a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, there is little interest in the United States for increasing aid abroad. On the contrary, industrial nations expect to bring in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52178968\">tens of billions</a> in debt payments in 2020. The International Monetary Fund, aid organizations and world leaders are calling on creditors to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/25/africa-leads-calls-for-debt-relief-in-face-of-coronavirus-crisis\">suspend</a> these payments. But there is much more that could be done. Many of the same leaders, including the <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2020/03/26/pr20108-remarks-by-imf-managing-director-during-an-extraordinary-g20-leaders-summit\">IMF leadership</a> and Nobel laureate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/07/world-must-combat-looming-debt-meltdown-in-developing-countries-covid-19\">economists</a>, have called for the IMF to help countries through this crisis by providing, as it did in 2009, large amounts of debt-free <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/Sheets/2016/08/01/14/51/Special-Drawing-Right-SDR\">special </a><a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/Sheets/2016/08/01/14/51/Special-Drawing-Right-SDR\">drawing </a><a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/Sheets/2016/08/01/14/51/Special-Drawing-Right-SDR\">rights</a>. We could end the illegal sanctions on countries like Iran and Venezuela, which target civilians and have caused tens of thousands of deaths. Or we could make a commitment to ensuring that when a vaccine is found, it will be available to all.</p> <p>American leaders have not taken any of these actions \u2013 and we should not be surprised. This is the way of a civilization that has lost touch with its own humanity. It is the sign of a civilization that cannot last. But Christ\u2019s life and death reminds us that we must continue the struggle. The resurrection reminded Christ\u2019s followers that the death of the body is not the ultimate evil. On the contrary, it is the death of the soul, the death of our ability to see clearly what is right, which is far more devastating.</p> <p>Christ\u2019s life was an indictment of the Roman Empire and ultimately he was executed for his revolutionary protests. Pontius Pilate washed his hands before ordering the crucifixion, much like western governments might wash their hands today as they turn away from the suffering they could have avoided.</p> <p>This Easter, the resurrection offers an indictment of empires and leaders that have become cruel in their hunger for power. But it also offers us a path forward. Though empires rise and fall, our ability to love and care for one another persists. When we press on in solidarity with those who are suffering, even when a way forward is not clear, we prepare ourselves to receive the good news of this season.</p> <ul> <li><p>The Rev Dr William J Barber II is president of Repairers of the Breach and co-chair of the Poor People\u2019s Campaign</p></li> <li><p>Dr Leah Hunt-Hendrix is a writer and co-founder of Way to Win</p></li> </ul>",

There\u2019s no justification for this kind of behaviour,\u201d they said. \u201cYou can justify thinking about the business community. It\u2019s cool to try and find [economic] solutions [to this crisis]. What\u2019s not cool is ignoring what all of the world\u2019s top epidemiological experts are saying.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople are going to get sick [in Brazil], and if they get sick at the same time we will find ourselves in the same situation as <a href=\"https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS-LOMBARDY/0100B5LT46P/index.html\">Italy</a> and Wuhan.\u201d</p> \n<p>Since mid-March, the governors of nearly all of Brazil\u2019s 27 states have been trying to slow transmission by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wilsonwitzel/status/1249039267734659072?s=20\">ordering citizens indoors</a>.

One was the failure of state governments to sufficiently support poor <em>favela</em> residents who had no option but to work. Another was the difficulty in persuading exuberant, family-focused Brazilians to shun relatives.</p> \n<p>\u201cBrazilians are having a really hard time with social distancing. We aren\u2019t used to this.

  "<p>It was Peter Bonetti\u2019s misfortune that despite his goalkeeping agility \u2013 his nickname \u201cthe Cat\u201d was well deserved \u2013 and despite the many matches he played (more than 700 for Chelsea), he is remembered above all for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jun/09/world-cup-stunning-moments-gordon-banks-england-1970\" title=\"\">a disastrous hot day in Mexico</a> in the World Cup of 1970, a match in which Bonetti, who has died aged 78, should not even have been playing.</p> <p>It was the quarter-final of the World Cup against West Germany, whom England had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/may/30/world-cup-final-1966-england-west-germany-live\" title=\"\">beaten four years earlier</a> at Wembley in the final. The first-choice England goalkeeper was the unrivalled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/12/gordon-banks-obituary\" title=\"\">Gordon Banks</a> but on the morning of the match in L\u00e9on, scheduled absurdly for the intense heat of noon and at a breathless altitude, Banks was to be seen outside the England team hotel, pallid of countenance, walking slowly across the lawn as he was supported by the anxious England doctor, <a href=\"http://www.thefa.com/news/2015/apr/08/england-1966-team-doctor-neil-phillips-passes-away\" title=\"\">Neil Phillips</a>. He was suffering from food poisoning. </p> <p>So it was that Bonetti played instead of Banks, though hardly in the ideal condition to do so, as he had not had a game for some time. When England squandered a 2-0 lead to lose to West Germany 3-2, Bonetti was largely made the villain of the piece. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c6e45ffe8004b57d7e843d12f6ab9f1db9b5bf89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6e45ffe8004b57d7e843d12f6ab9f1db9b5bf89/10_213_2661_1597/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gerd M\u00fcller scores the winning goal for West Germany past Peter Bonetti in goal during the 1970 World Cup quarter-final, in L\u00e9on, Mexico, for a final score of 3-2.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gerd M\u00fcller scores the winning goal for West Germany past Peter Bonetti in goal during the 1970 World Cup quarter-final, in L\u00e9on, Mexico, for a final score of 3-2.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PLP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He was seriously at fault for the first German goal, when he allowed Franz Beckenbauer\u2019s low, unexceptional shot to run under his body. The second German goal, however, scored by the stocky centre-forward Uwe Seeler, was something of a freak. When Karl-Heinz Schnellinger lobbed the ball into the English goalmouth, Bonetti, off his line, was arguably out of position, but the back header with which Seeler scored was bizarre. And besides, it could be argued that a flagging England defence failed to move up in time to put Seeler offside.</p> <p>As for the third and decisive German goal, it had as much to do with the defenders\u2019 weariness as with Bonetti\u2019s positioning. Terry Cooper, the England left-back, who should surely have been substituted, was too tired to prevent West Germany\u2019s inspired substitution, the outside-right J\u00fcrgen Grabowski, from crossing. Bonetti did not get to the high ball, Hannes L\u00f6hr headed it back, and the prolific Gerd M\u00fcller volleyed fiercely home.</p> <p>It would prove to be Bonetti\u2019s seventh and last game for England. But his international record, until it came to L\u00e9on, had been excellent. The first match came in July 1966, a 2-0 victory against Denmark in Copenhagen, and before the L\u00e9on match he had conceded only one goal in his previous six.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76947110c3166db61f21fc398ab018c8eeffdf20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76947110c3166db61f21fc398ab018c8eeffdf20/0_333_2805_1684/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Bonetti in goal for Chelsea leaps to grab the ball from Jack Charlton of Leeds United during the FA Cup final replay at Old Trafford, 1970.

He had also been a member of the victorious 1966 England World Cup squad, although Banks had played all the matches in that tournament. </p> <p>Born in Putney, south-west London, to Swiss parents, Bonetti moved with his family, as a child, to the Sussex coast, where his parents opened a cafe in Worthing. His talents as a goalkeeper were soon apparent in local schoolboy football and he was enlisted by Reading for its youth teams. Then, after his mother had written to Chelsea asking them to give her son a trial, he was signed at Stamford Bridge.</p> <p>In the 1960-61 season, at the age of 19, he became the first-team goalkeeper. Chelsea were relegated to the Second Division but, under the managership of Tommy Docherty, they at once returned to the First. Bonetti\u2019s later relations with Docherty became difficult \u2013 I remember an untypical outburst from him one day, after training, in a cafe near Stamford Bridge.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2259fea36fadcb2adc31104f06e80188891cd47b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2259fea36fadcb2adc31104f06e80188891cd47b/0_140_5426_3256/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Bonetti, right, and Ron Harris hold the trophy aloft as the Chelsea football team return in triumph to the King\u2019s Road in London after their FA Cup final victory, 1970.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Bonetti, right, and Ron Harris hold the trophy aloft as the Chelsea football team return in triumph to the King\u2019s Road in London after their FA Cup final victory, 1970.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Cairns/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Initially, however, a young Chelsea team flourished under Docherty and in 1965 Bonetti played a significant part in helping them win the League Cup final, then a two-legged affair, against Leicester City. That achievement was outshone when his inspired goalkeeping enabled Chelsea, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/mar/21/chelsea-v-leeds-united-1970-fa-cup-final-replay-live\" title=\"\">a replay in the final</a> against Leeds in 1970, at last to gain the FA Cup which had eluded them since their foundation in 1905. </p> <p>Bonetti was just as good when, in Athens in May 1971, Chelsea beat the formidable Real Madrid to take the European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup.

Lineker says something to Gascoigne and then pulls his Grave Face before saying \u2018Have a word with him\u2019 to the bench. That is just too cruel. It does rather seem that the West Germans got him booked, which is a desperate shame because this game has otherwise been played in an incredibly good spirit. Poor old Gazza. He has been the star of England\u2019s tournament and now his whole world has collapsed. It\u2019s not just Gazza, either; English football has just had its heart broken into a million tiny pieces.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-52c4bd31-afe0-4aa9-8dc0-1de69507a830\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/27/1395934461775/b6fd8444-9b2e-4e63-8620-46afc5f076af-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"England's Paul Gascoigne.

  "<p>In times of great uncertainty, knowing how to make your own bread and thereby feed your family, is palpably reassuring. The very act of kneading dough is calming, like Play-Doh for adults. So, of course, newbie bakers are all over social media, obsessing about \u201cbubbling mothers\u201d (AKA sourdough starters).</p> <p>Look a little closer, though, and they\u2019re not very happy. \u201cWe are all baking bread and some of us are not so good at it,\u201d tweeted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TonyTassell/status/1245956933066076163\">one journalist, dejectedly</a>. That\u2019s because sourdough is high-maintenance baking. People write memoirs about mastering the technique. By contrast, watching Noji Gaylard making South African steamed bread (see below) is like hugging a baby. Three minutes and 30 seconds of pure calm. Her recipe, alongside the others included in our 10 basic breads, is easy enough for even the most inexperienced baker.</p> <p>But first a note about yeast. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/commentisfree/2020/apr/01/shoppers-hoard-yeast-solution-soda-bread\">As Adrian Chiles has noted</a>, it appears to have been stockpiled right off all the shelves. So, if you do have any, set aside a portion of whatever leavened dough you make to leaven the next (variously called <a href=\"https://www.cuisinefiend.com/387/basic-old-dough-sourdough\">old dough</a> and <em><a href=\"https://joepastry.com/2009/how_to_make_pate_fermentee/\">p\u00e2te ferment\u00e9e</a></em>; you\u2019ll find plenty of instructions for this online). And, if you don\u2019t, you could try making your own yeast. Lisa Bedford, the self-styled Survival Mom, <a href=\"https://thesurvivalmom.com/august-skill-of-the-month-make-your-own-yeast/\">has written a really thorough how-to</a>. I appreciate that making your own yeast somewhat negates the premise of this piece, but you\u2019ve got to admit it\u2019s awesome that you can.</p> <p>Also, reserve any pasta or potato cooking water for your bread baking. As <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nigella_Lawson/status/1243422413242548224?s=20\">Nigella tweeted</a>: \u201cIt will help the bread\u2019s texture and rise.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c7dde67a809c3e0edb6fb2374b2319fa1248def\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c7dde67a809c3e0edb6fb2374b2319fa1248def/0_553_4375_2625/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Meera Sodha\u2019s coconut yoghurt flatbreads with garlic mushrooms.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Meera Sodha\u2019s coconut yoghurt flatbreads with garlic mushrooms.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Louise Hagger/The Guardian.

Prop styling: Jennifer Kay.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Flatbreads</strong></h2> <p>At its simplest, a flatbread is flour and water mixed into a dough, rolled into balls, rested, flattened and griddled. Dan Lepard <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dan_lepard/status/1243894463069597698\">tweeted the basic ratio</a>: 500g of any wheat flour (white, wholemeal, self-raising, plain) to 300g cold water. Add some form of oil to the mix, and you get everything from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/16/master-vegetables-like-a-gujarati-stuffed-aubergines-recipe\">chapatis</a> and rotis (<a href=\"http://meerasodha.com/my-quick-peshwari-rotis-in-the-guardian/\">Meera Sodha</a> fills hers with coconut, raisins and almonds) to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/tortilla_wraps_70015\">tortillas</a> and <a href=\"https://tarasmulticulturaltable.com/lavash-armenian-flatbread/\">lavash</a>. <a href=\"https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/bread-recipes/easy-flatbreads/\">Jamie Oliver</a> switches things up a bit, using yoghurt, self-raising flour and a little baking powder, and cooks with griddle pan over a high heat. Elsewhere, his <a href=\"https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/bread-recipes/fluffy-coconut-breads/\">coconut flatbreads</a> are made with just coconut milk and self-raising flour and fried in butter.</p> <h2><strong>Quick bread</strong></h2> <p>AKA batter bread, this is the base recipe used in such things as apple bread, banana bread and the French <a href=\"https://www.davidlebovitz.com/pistachio-and-chorizo-cake/\">savoury cake</a><em> </em>studded with everything from bacon and olives. You mix dry ingredients (flour, baking powder, salt) with wet ingredients (milk/buttermilk/yoghurt, oil and eggs) and flavour it any way you like. <a href=\"https://bakerbettie.com/basic-quick-bread-recipe-sweet-or-savory/\">Kristin \u201cBaker Bettie\u201d Hoffmann</a> gives you every option thinkable: sweet, savoury, gluten-free, dairy-free, vegan and without baking powder (she separates the eggs, and whips the whites to get the rise needed). Texture-wise, this is more on the muffin/cake side of things, so if that\u2019s not what you\u2019re after, read on.</p> <h2><strong>Soda bread</strong></h2> <p>The original no-kneader, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/commentisfree/2020/apr/01/shoppers-hoard-yeast-solution-soda-bread\">as Chiles put it </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/commentisfree/2020/apr/01/shoppers-hoard-yeast-solution-soda-bread\">last week</a>, a gift to the yeastless. The rise comes from bicarb, so that ingredient is a must, but flour-wise it\u2019s flexible: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/nov/24/foodanddrink.baking16\">wholemeal, oatmeal</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2014/feb/05/how-to-bake-perfect-soda-bread\">rolled oats</a>, <a href=\"https://www.rivercottage.net/recipes/soda-bread\">plain</a>, <a href=\"https://www.redonline.co.uk/food/recipes/a502894/justin-gellatly-soda-bread/\">self-raising</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/nov/02/quick-fix-baking-recipes\">rye</a> or whatever mixture you can manage. Liquid-wise, milk, yoghurt, buttermilk, Nigella\u2019s pasta water: they\u2019ll all work, too. You\u2019ll want a dollop of salt and sweetness (honey, soft brown sugar); Chiles flavours his with treacle and Marmite, and nothing has ever endeared a columnist to me more. And there\u2019s nothing to say you can\u2019t jazz it up further: Oliver puts <a href=\"https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/bread-recipes/chocolate-chip-soda-bread/\">dark chocolate and hazelnuts</a> in his.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec43cefa871a1c0567a9765f7fe3a40fb513d78f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec43cefa871a1c0567a9765f7fe3a40fb513d78f/0_0_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A no-knead crusty loaf.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A no-knead crusty loaf.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: RooM the Agency/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>No-knead crusty loaf</strong></h2> <p>The New York Times calls <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018203-simple-crusty-bread\">this</a> the world\u2019s easiest yeasted loaf; a step-up from the already groundbreaking <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/11376-no-knead-bread\">easy method devised by Jim Lahey </a>(if you\u2019re a budding bread person, I recommend his books). You mix plain flour with yeast, salt and lukewarm water into a loose dough, cover and let rise for two to five hours. Then you shape it and bake it. The crustiness comes from having a broiling panful of water \u2013 or a few ice cubes \u2013 in the bottom of the oven to steam the loaf while it cooks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"469f420be35867e80ca909a8e25d25cbb2cebfa9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/469f420be35867e80ca909a8e25d25cbb2cebfa9/568_0_2736_2736/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pitta bread \u2026 perfect for picnics.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pitta bread \u2026 perfect for picnics.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Pitta</strong></h2> <p>Putting yeast in a wheaten flatbread essentially means it can puff up while baking, to create those soft pockets so perfect for picnics. Yotam Ottolenghi puts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/mar/14/pitta-patter-yotam-ottolenghis-recipes-for-homemade-pitta-with-chicken-skewers-or-herb-fritters\">sugar in his dough</a> and seven spices in his chicken filling, and, well, what more could you want? Although it is technically possible to make them completely lean, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2016/jul/13/how-to-cook-the-perfect-pitta-bread\">Felicity Cloake</a> doesn\u2019t recommend it: the fat contributes to flavour and shelf-life.</p> <h2><strong>Hard dough bread</strong></h2> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.homemadezagat.com/2016/11/easy-jamaican-hard-dough-bread.html\">Jamaican speciality</a>, this is a plain-flour yeasted dough, enriched with butter and sugar. It takes a short knead (you want the dough nice and elastic) and a 45-minute rest. You then roll it out flat with a rolling pin and \u2013 to give it that moist, dense crumb \u2013 roll it right back up again into a tight log, tucking the ends in (DaJen Eat\u2019s Jen and her grandmother Cynthia <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-1hCTaVZXA\">will show you how</a>). Then, after a short rest, it is baked golden brown in a loaf pan.</p> <h2><strong>Steamed bread</strong></h2> <p>The one loaf you don\u2019t need an oven for. This South African beauty involves mixing a very sticky batter of plain flour, salt, sugar, yeast (no oil) and lukewarm water in a bowl with a wooden spoon. (<a href=\"https://www.africanfoodmap.com/recipes/steamed-bread-south-african-style/\">Gaylard\u2019s demo</a> is quite possibly the most mesmerising cooking video I\u2019ve ever come across. It\u2019s now my lockdown backdrop.) Cover with a lid to let it rest, then beat it once more and let it rest again. Pour into a buttered bowl and place in a large pot for which you have a lid, with enough boiling water to come halfway up the side of your bowl, adding water when necessary to keep the steam going. It is cooked when, as with a cake, a knife stuck into the centre comes out clean.</p> <h2><strong>Maple oat breakfast bread</strong></h2> <p>This takes a couple more ingredients (maple syrup and rolled oats) and an overnight rest (eight hours or more), but it makes, <a href=\"https://food52.com/recipes/24198-maple-oat-breakfast-bread\">as Food52 notes</a>, darn good toast. Much like in soda bread, the oats impart a welcome bite. As with the no-knead crusty loaf, you\u2019ll need an oven-safe heavy-based pot with a lid to achieve consistent, high heat and a good seal so the moisture doesn\u2019t escape.</p> <h2><strong>Focaccia</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/feb/08/baking-recipe\">Nigel Slater once said</a> that he thought focaccia was the bread to attempt first, before any trad white loaf. \u201cA batch rarely fails.\u201d Now most recipes will ask for strong white bread flour and/or 00 flour (used for making pasta). But <a href=\"https://www.cookstr.com/recipes/focaccia-with-onions-genoese-style?ss=78888&amp;cs=15883_1585912160_36571896fb76bd4fa933de2464fd4f73\">Marcella Hazan makes hers</a> with plain flour, and she\u2019s not someone to mess with.

  "<p>He was content to be known, he often said, as the man who never won the world championship: a way of distinguishing him from those of lesser gifts but better luck who had actually succeeded in winning motor racing\u2019s principal honour. But it was the manner in which Stirling Moss, who has died aged 90, effectively handed the trophy to one of his greatest rivals that established his name as a byword for sporting chivalry, as well as for speed and courage.</p> \n<p>It was after the Portuguese Grand Prix on the street circuit at Oporto, the eighth round of the 1958 series, that Moss voluntarily appeared before the stewards to plead the case of Mike Hawthorn, threatened with disqualification from second place for apparently pushing his stalled Ferrari against the direction of the track after spinning on his final lap. Moss, who had won the race in his Vanwall, testified that his compatriot had, in fact, pushed the car on the pavement, and had thus not been on the circuit itself. Hawthorn was reinstated, along with his six championship points. Three months later, when the season ended in Casablanca, he won the title by the margin of a single point from Moss, who was never heard to express regret over his gesture.</p> \n<p>Such sportsmanship had become part of his appeal, along with the devil-may-care charisma formerly associated with Battle of Britain fighter pilots. His public image was enhanced by his willingness to invite feature writers and TV cameras into his town house in Shepherd Market, the district of Mayfair in central London where he lived, even when married, in a kind of bachelor-pad splendour amid a panoply of hi-tech gadgets.</p> \n<p>The aura continued to surround him long after an accident on the track truncated his career at the age of 32, when he was still in his prime. The sight of Moss, in his later decades, entering the paddock at a race meeting, accompanied by his third wife, the effervescent and indispensable Susie, never failed to draw shoals of fans, photographers and journalists keen to hear his opinion on the latest controversy.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e49c695f7cf73e8c46a1c86477a43482a58a9790\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e49c695f7cf73e8c46a1c86477a43482a58a9790/0_41_3908_2345/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stirling Moss, right, and his team-mate Tony Brooks, after winning the British Grand Prix at Aintree, 1957.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stirling Moss, right, and his team-mate Tony Brooks, after winning the British Grand Prix at Aintree, 1957.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keystone/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>He loved to fight against the odds, and the greatest of his Formula One victories, at the wheel of an obsolete, underpowered Lotus-Climax, came in 1961 at Monaco and the N\u00fcrburgring, two circuits that placed the highest demands on skill and nerve. Those wins could be set alongside the epic victory in the 1955 Mille Miglia and the historic triumph in the 1957 British Grand Prix at Aintree, when he and Tony Brooks became the first British drivers to win a round of the world championship series in a British car, prefacing a long period of British domination.</p> \n<p>Before his retirement as a professional driver in 1962 he had competed in 529 races, not counting rallies, hill climbs and record attempts. He won 212 of them, an extraordinary 40% success rate. Of the 66 world championship grands prix he entered between 1951 and 1961, he won 16, a ratio unfavourably distorted by early years spent in uncompetitive British cars and by a pronounced share of mechanical misfortune.</p> \n<p>He was born to parents who had met at Brooklands, in Surrey, the great cathedral of prewar British motor racing. His father, Alfred, was a descendant of a family of Ashkenazi Jews known, until the end of the 19th century, as Moses. A successful dentist, Alfred Moss also possessed a passion for motor sport, and competed at Brooklands in the 1920s; while studying in the US, he entered the Indianapolis 500, finishing 16th. His wife, Aileen (nee Craufurd), was the great-great-niece of \u201cBlack Bob\u201d Craufurd, a hero of the Peninsular war in the early 19th century; an equestrian, she also entered races and rallies in her own three-wheeled Morgan.</p> \n<p>When their son was born they were living in Thames Ditton. Two years later, after the birth of a daughter, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/oct/27/pat-moss-carlsson-obituary\" title=\"\">Pat</a>, they moved to a large house in Bray, Berkshire, called Long White Cloud. Both children rode horses competitively from an early age (Pat was to become a champion horsewoman and rally driver). Stirling, educated at Clewer Manor prep school and Haileybury, Hertfordshire, neither enjoyed nor excelled at academic work. It was at Haileybury that he was subjected to antisemitic bullying for the first time.</p> \n<p>He was nine when his father bought him an old Austin Seven, which he drove in the fields surrounding Long White Cloud. At 15 he obtained his first driving licence and, with \u00a350 from his equestrian winnings plus the proceeds from the sale of the Austin, bought his own Morgan. It was followed by an MG (in which he was discovered by Aileen Moss while attempting, aged 17, to surrender his virginity to one of his father\u2019s dental receptionists) and then, in the winter of 1947-48, by a prewar BMW 328.

But motor racing was where his heart lay, and for his 18th birthday his father bought him a Cooper-JAP, powered by a 500cc motorcycle engine, with which to compete in the new Formula Three series. After a couple of good performances in hill climbs, he entered and won his first single-seater race on the Brough aerodrome circuit in east Yorkshire on 7 April 1948.</p> \n<p>Ruled out of national service by bouts of illness, including nephritis, Moss was soon a regular winner against fierce competition and before long he was making occasional trips to races in Italy and France. In May 1950, when a race was held in support of the Monaco Grand Prix, he set the best practice time, won his heat and then won the final.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/19/letter-sir-stirling-moss-obituary\">Letter: Sir Stirling Moss obituary</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>As his reputation grew, he was approached in 1951 by Enzo Ferrari, who offered him a car for a Formula Two race at Bari, as the prelude to a full contract for the following season. Moss and his father made the long journey down to Puglia, only to discover that the only Ferrari was reserved for another driver, the veteran <a href=\"https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/march-1988/6/around-and-about-piero-taruffi\" title=\"\">Piero Taruffi</a>. No explanation was offered and Moss\u2019s fury at such treatment led to a lasting rift and a special sense of satisfaction whenever he managed to beat the Italian team, particularly in a British car.</p> \n<p>A victory in the 1954 Sebring 12-hours, sharing the wheel of an OSCA sports car with the American driver Bill Lloyd, opened the season in which he made his international breakthrough. Deciding to take the plunge into Formula One, he and his manager, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10695795/Ken-Gregory-obituary.html\" title=\"\">Ken Gregory</a>, first offered his services to Mercedes-Benz, then on the brink of a return to grand prix racing. When the German team politely indicated that they thought he needed more experience, Gregory and his father negotiated the purchase of a Maserati 250F, the new model from Ferrari\u2019s local rivals.</p> \n<p>No racing driver can have invested \u00a35,500 more wisely. Moss and the 250F bonded instantly, and he was soon winning the Aintree 200, his maiden Formula One victory. By the time he entered the car for the German Grand Prix, he was being supported by the official Maserati team, which had recognised his world-beating potential. At Monza that September he was leading the Italian Grand Prix and looking a certainty for his first win in a round of the world championship when an oil pipe broke with 10 laps to go.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"775ce58a4a1108b55f15c7553dcda49e13256507\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/775ce58a4a1108b55f15c7553dcda49e13256507/0_180_5392_3236/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stirling Moss taking part in the Pescara Grand Prix in a British Vanwall car, 1957.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stirling Moss taking part in the Pescara Grand Prix in a British Vanwall car, 1957.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bernard Cahier/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Mercedes had taken note, however, and signed him up for 1955, as No 2 to the world champion, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituaries-juan-manuel-fangio-1591999.html\" title=\"\">Juan Manuel Fangio</a>. Although neither spoke the other\u2019s language, a warm respect grew between them. At Aintree, having won three of the season\u2019s first four races and assured himself of a third world title, Fangio took his turn to sit in the slipstream as Moss became the first Briton to win his home grand prix.</p> \n<p>In 1955, too, Moss won the Mille Miglia, the gruelling time trial around 1,000 miles of Italian public roads, in a Mercedes 300SLR sports car. During two reconnaissance runs his co-driver, the journalist Denis Jenkinson, prepared a set of pace notes that were inscribed on a roll of paper, held on a spindle inside a small aluminium box. As they charged from Brescia to Rome and back, Jenkinson scrolled through the notes and shouted instructions to the driver. They completed the course in 10 hours and seven minutes, at an average speed of 97.95mph \u2013 a record that stands in perpetuity, since the race was abandoned after several spectators were killed two years later.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/27/letter-sir-stirling-moss-obituary\">Letter: Sir Stirling Moss obituary</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>When Mercedes bowed out of Formula One at the end of 1955, Moss returned to Maserati while Fangio went to Ferrari. Moss won at Monaco and Monza, finishing runner-up to Fangio in the championship for the second time in a row. However he had always hoped to win grands prix in a British car, and for 1957 he was happy to accept an invitation to drive a Vanwall, a Formula One car built by the industrialist <a href=\"https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/may-2003/26/tony-vandervell\" title=\"\">Tony Vandervell</a> at his factory in Acton, west London.</p> \n<p>At Aintree, after a patchy start to the season, he fell out of the lead with a misfiring engine.

When Vanwall did not attend the first race of the year, in Buenos Aires, he was allowed to drive a little two-litre Cooper-Climax entered by his friend <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1392695/Rob-Walker.html\" title=\"\">Rob Walker</a> and, through a clever bluff involving pit stops, managed to beat the Ferraris. Back in the Vanwall, he won the Dutch, Portuguese and Moroccan grands prix, but was again condemned to second place in the final standings, this time behind Hawthorn.</p> \n<p>Vandervell was so distressed by the death of Stuart Lewis-Evans, the team\u2019s third driver, in Morocco at the end of the season that he withdrew his cars during the winter, leaving Moss without a drive for 1959. The solution was to form an alliance with Walker, the heir to a whisky fortune, whose Cooper-Climax would be looked after by Moss\u2019s faithful mechanic, Alf Francis, a wartime refugee from Poland. The dark blue car suffered from unreliability until late summer, when Moss took it to victories in Portugal and Italy.</p> \n<p>Moss and Walker remained in partnership for 1960, but a fine victory in Monaco with a new Lotus-Climax was followed at Spa by a bad crash during a practice session, the car losing a wheel at around 140mph and hitting a bank with such force that the driver suffered two broken legs, three crushed vertebrae and a broken nose. To general astonishment he was back at the wheel inside two months, winning his comeback race in a Lotus sports car.</p> \n<p>In 1961 his virtuosity overcame the limitations of Walker\u2019s ageing Lotus and its four-cylinder engine. Twice he outran the V6 Ferraris of Wolfgang von Trips, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/30/formulaone.motorsports\" title=\"\">Phil Hill</a> and Richie Ginther, first in a mad chase at Monaco and then, on a wet track, at the 14-mile N\u00fcrburgring.

Old resentments were cast aside and Moss accepted this rare invitation. But an accident at Goodwood, at the wheel of a Lotus, meant that it was never put to the test.</p> \n<p>No conclusive evidence has ever emerged to explain why, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/apr/24/stirling-moss-crash-goodwood-1962-archive\" title=\"\">on that Easter Monday</a>, his car went straight on at St Mary\u2019s, a fast righthander, and hit an earth bank. It took 40 minutes to cut his unconscious body out of the crumpled wreckage.</p> \n<p>The outward signs of physical damage \u2013 severe facial wounds, a crushed left cheekbone, a displaced eye socket, a broken arm, a double fracture of the leg at knee and ankle, and many bad cuts \u2013 were less significant than the deep bruising to the right side of his brain, which put him in a coma for a month and left him paralysed in the left side for six months, with his survival a matter of national concern.</p> \n<p>After lengthy treatment, convalescence and corrective surgery, he started driving on the road again. And in May 1963, a year and a week after the accident, he returned to Goodwood, lapping in a Lotus sports car for half an hour on a damp track. When he returned to the pits, it was with bad news. The old reflexes, he believed, had been dulled, and without that sharpness he could only be an ex-racing driver. In the fullness of time, he came to regret the decision. Had he postponed it a further two or three years, he felt, his recovery would have been complete and, at 35, he might have had several seasons at the top ahead of him.</p> \n<p>Instead he occupied himself with his property company. There was also the well remunerated business of being Stirling Moss, constantly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/sep/13/stirling-moss-interview-f1\" title=\"\">in demand</a> for commercial and ceremonial events.

  "<p>A lot has been written about how this pandemic is exacerbating social inequalities. But what if it\u2019s because our societies are so unequal that this pandemic happened?</p> <p>There is a school of thought that, historically, pandemics have been more likely to occur at times of social inequality and discord. As the poor get poorer, the thinking goes, their baseline health suffers, making them more prone to infection. At the same time they are forced to move more, in search of work, and to gravitate to cities. The rich, meanwhile, have more to spend on luxuries, including products that hail from far-flung places. The world becomes more tightly connected through trade, and germs, people and luxury goods travel together along trade routes that connect cities. On paper, it looks like a perfect storm.</p> <p>What about in reality? Historian Peter Turchin has described a strong statistical association between global connectedness, social crises and pandemics throughout history. An example is the second century CE, when the Roman and Chinese empires were at the peak of their wealth and power; the poor in both places were very poor, and the ancient silk routes were enjoying a heyday. Starting in 165CE, the Antonine plagues struck Rome; within a decade plague was devastating China too, and both empires then went into decline.</p> <p>The plague of Justinian in the 6th century and the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Black-Death\">Black Death</a> in the 14th century emerged in similar circumstances, and Turchin sees the same forces at work again today: globalisation, leading to the emergence of new human pathogens, combined with widening inequality. \u201cAnd now it looks like our Age of Discord got its own pandemic,\u201d he wrote in a <a href=\"http://peterturchin.com/cliodynamica/coronavirus-and-our-age-of-discord/\">blog</a> last week.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-could-turn-back-the-clock-30-years-on-global-poverty\">Coronavirus could turn back the clock 30 years on global poverty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pandemics don\u2019t always trigger social unrest, but they can do, by throwing into relief the very inequalities that caused them. That\u2019s because they hit the poor hardest \u2013 those in low-paid or unstable employment, who live in crowded accommodation, have underlying health issues, and for whom healthcare is less affordable or less accessible. This was true in the past and remains so today. During the 2009 flu pandemic the death rate was <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22297400\">three times higher</a> in the poorest fifth of England\u2019s population than in the richest. Covid-19 is showing no signs of departing from the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/world/europe/coronavirus-inequality.html\">pattern</a>, which, because of the way the socioeconomic dice fall, also has a racial dimension.</p> <p>But there is something brand new about this pandemic, which has never been seen before in the history of humanity \u2013 and that is our unprecedented global experiment in lockdown. These lockdown measures are designed to slow the spread of the disease, relieve the burden on health systems and ultimately save lives \u2013 and it looks as if they may be doing <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/health-52133054\">that</a>. But they may also be exacerbating social inequalities themselves.</p> <p>We won\u2019t have a full picture of their impact until the pandemic is over, but there have been anecdotal <a href=\"https://voxeu.org/article/covid-19-inequality-and-gig-economy-workers\">reports</a> that point to this, and some more systematic analyses are emerging. Preliminary findings from a survey of 1,200 Norwegians, <a href=\"https://www.oslomet.no/en/research/featured-research/how-the-coronavirus-pandemic-is-affecting-people-s-health-and-careers\">published</a> last week, indicate that people with lower levels of education and income are more likely to be temporarily laid off. They can apply for a government furlough scheme, similar to the one in the UK, but they are also more likely to see their income fall and to worry that their unemployment might become permanent.</p> <p>The Norwegian study found no correlation between poverty and self-reported sickness from Covid-19, but it did find that poorer, less well-educated people were less likely to comply with social distancing guidelines. It\u2019s hard to tell why, says demographer Svenn-Erik Mamelund of Oslo Metropolitan University, who was involved in the survey, but he has theories.</p> <p>People in lower socioeconomic groups may feel more pressure to go out to work, Mamelund says. They may also have lower levels of health literacy, less trust in officialdom, and even language problems if they are of non-Norwegian origin. He fears that these lower levels of compliance with public health measures might spill into higher levels of sickness and death later on, as they are exposed to the disease.</p> <p>Whether these measures are justified by the threat Covid-19 poses to human life is impossible to say, but those who imposed them knew there would be a high price to pay. Last year Mamelund sat on a <a href=\"https://www.who.int/influenza/publications/public_health_measures/publication/en/\">committee</a> that advised the World Health Organization on non-pharmaceutical interventions in case of a pandemic. The committee\u2019s job was to assess the costs and benefits of measures for slowing disease spread \u2013 everything from hand-washing to border closure \u2013 based on the available evidence. They came up with a list of recommendations that excluded lockdown, even in the worst-case scenario. \u201cWe never suggested lockdown because we knew it would be so harmful socially and economically for all countries,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I never thought the rest of the world would follow China\u2019s lead.\u201d</p> <p>Norway has a small population \u2013 5.4 million people \u2013 and a well-funded welfare state. There have been no protests there, so far, but the social impact of lockdown has been more visible elsewhere. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/india-wracked-by-greatest-exodus-since-partition-due-to-coronavirus\">India</a> there have been reports of deaths among unemployed migrant workers returning home in search of food; many countries, including the US, have seen workers taking <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikes_during_the_2020_coronavirus_pandemic#Rent_strikes\">industrial action</a>, and anger has been expressed in rural communities over wealthy city-dwellers retreating to their second homes for the duration.</p> <p>Governments should keep an eye on these developments, in weighing up when and how to lift the lockdown, because even if it\u2019s difficult to argue today that the cure is worse than the disease, the cure might provoke an entirely different malaise \u2013 and history teaches us that no society is immune to that.</p> <p>That\u2019s the symptomatic treatment. In the long term, of course, they \u2013 and we \u2013 should address the dreadful inequality in our societies, which this pandemic is picking apart with a lethal scalpel.</p> <p>\u2022 Laura Spinney is a science journalist, novelist and author.

Outbreaks of localised barbarism and criminality are predictable when people feel impoverished, paranoid and vulnerable. Already, in Italy, we\u2019ve had instances of toughs refusing to pay in supermarkets. Democratic politicians have had a taste of almost dictatorial power over the people, and it will be hard to roll back rule by emergency decrees. Countries like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/hungarian-journalists-fear-coronavirus-law-may-be-used-to-jail-them\">Hungary</a> might be slipping away from the democratic fraternity. Public health will be an excuse to ramp up state surveillance and, when we need to jump-start the economy, environmental protections may well be ripped up. The counter-revolution, those seers say, is just around the corner.</p> <p>But despite all these fantasies, one of the consequences of the crisis is that we\u2019re suddenly more serious about the truth. \u201cAccurate scientific, economic, political and social information about what is happening somewhere,\u201d <a href=\"Bill%20Foster,%20a%20history%20lecturer%20at%20Homerton%20College,%20Cambridge\">Bill Foster</a>, a history lecturer at Homerton College, Cambridge, told me last week, \u201cis suddenly valuable everywhere.

We might just be tempted now to remember what we lost when we started to abandon trying to find truths together.\u201d It\u2019s intriguing that it\u2019s taken this pandemic, rather than sensitive referendums and elections, to persuade social media companies of the need to <a href=\"Bill%20Foster,%20a%20history%20lecturer%20at%20Homerton%20College,%20Cambridge\">combat fake news</a> and conspiracy theories.</p> <p>Without truth there is no trust, and the gates of civilisation are wide open to political blackguards and devious disinformation. Those gates have been open for decades, and it\u2019s one of the hard-to-swallow lessons of this contagion that gate-keeping is paramount, that we need boundaries and membranes. Having managed a therapeutic community for almost a decade, I\u2019ve always known that blocking, or expelling, damaging elements was vital to communal wellbeing (you can\u2019t, for example, have drug use in a rehab). I knew that monastic wisdom depended on enclosure. But I still instinctively baulked at any impediment to free movement on a global level. We internationalists inevitably struggle to accept the idea. And yet the very first principle of a functioning group (as enunciated by Nobel prize-winning political economist, <a href=\"Nobel%20Prize-winning%20political%20economist,%20Elinor%20Ostrom\">Elinor </a><a href=\"Nobel%20Prize-winning%20political%20economist,%20Elinor%20Ostrom\">Ostrom</a>) is \u201ceffective exclusion of external, unentitled parties\u201d.</p> <p>The penny has also dropped that wellbeing isn\u2019t individual but social. We are not actually independent at all, but dependent. We can make each other sick and we can try to make each other well. We\u2019ve understood that a healthy community (as Wendell Berry wrote in his essay <a href=\"https://scienceandsociety.duke.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Berry-Health-is-Membership.pdf\">Health Is Membership</a>) isn\u2019t merely human, but also \u201cits soil, its water, its air\u201d.</p> <p>It has been fascinating to see the speed at which other attitudes have changed. The indignation expressed towards people not respecting <a href=\"https://scienceandsociety.duke.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Berry-Health-is-Membership.pdf\">social distancing</a> (from those who would never normally describe themselves as moralists) has been understandably shrill: here too we\u2019ve suddenly realised that the wellbeing of the group is endangered by indifferent individuals, and that community \u2013 for which we\u2019ve yearned for so long \u2013 means originally simply a pooling of duties.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ba36caf01032dfedadb4284a7c06c27095a8af8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ba36caf01032dfedadb4284a7c06c27095a8af8/0_187_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man with a bouquet in San Fiorano, Italy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 16th day of quarantine in San Fiorano, one of the 11 small towns in northern Italy that has been on lockdown since February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marzio Toniolo/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/18/need-roots-disconnection-past-community\">The Need for Roots</a></em>, her manifesto for how to refound society after the second world war, the philosopher and activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/feb/03/religion-simone-weil\">Simone Weil</a> wrote that \u201cthe notion of obligations comes before that of rights\u201d. It\u2019s a complicated, but convincing case, and it seems to me that in the last month there has been a radical shift in the balance between rights and responsibilities that has changed the timbre of our lives. I\u2019ve never seen so many news items about <a href=\"the%20notion%20of%20obligations%20comes%20before%20that%20of%20rights\">applause</a>, or so many social media posts accompanied by clappy emojis. Before, \u201cin the absence of adversity\u201d, the psychiatrist and philosopher <a href=\"https://iainmcgilchrist.com/\">Iain McGilchrist</a> said this month: \u201cWe grew flabby, selfish. We manufactured grievances that now can be seen for what they were.\u201d Now, when people meet their obligations to us we\u2019re obliged. Gratitude replaces knee-jerk annoyance.</p> <p>The lockdown has made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/coronavirus-has-exposed-a-desperate-need-for-localism\">everything local</a>. The world has got much larger and we\u2019re rediscovering corner shops and neighbours, the wisdom of proximity and closeness. The great Italian communalist Lanza del Vasto once urged: \u201cFind the shortest, simplest way between the earth, the hands, and the mouth.\u201d That shortening of the supply chain has rehumanised us slightly. We\u2019re bartering with strangers on our street and sales of yeast and flour have increased exponentially as we rediscover the consolations of baking.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019ve come to an emergency stop. We're not just separated from others but we can no longer separate from ourselves</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I have a high-powered lawyer friend who has described the joy of just darning socks and knitting. It sounds folksy, I know, but the kitchen table is the centre of our lives once more. We\u2019re rediscovering that frugality and resourcefulness are creative, if not always comfortable. Last week I was cutting the communal grass of our palazzo \u2013 the only place our kids can play outside \u2013 with a borrowed billhook, which is a bit like cutting hair with a fork.</p> <p>That centring has been mental as well as physical. It\u2019s a truism of modern life that we struggle to be settled or present. Because we can be anywhere, we actually end up being nowhere. We suffer, as the sociologist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/jan/15/zygmunt-bauman-obituary\">Zygmunt Bauman</a> once wrote, an<strong> \u201c</strong>electronically assured out-of-placeness\u201d. We\u2019re notoriously fidgety and lacking attention. We just keep clicking and tapping. When I was running our community, one of the hardest things for those in early recovery was just to sit still. We used to have Quaker-like silences twice a day, and to begin with, many just couldn\u2019t cope with the sudden stillness.</p> <p>It seems to me as if we\u2019re all in a similar situation right now. We\u2019ve come to an emergency stop, and it\u2019s painful not just because we\u2019re separated from others, but because we can no longer separate from ourselves. Until now we\u2019ve kept frenetically busy to keep from reflection, but now that we\u2019re still, demons, voices and shame can quickly surface. I know friends who are suffering panic attacks, even something close to psychosis. Many are alone and far from the solace of any fellowship.</p> <p>The poet and psychologist Hala Alyan wrote a <a href=\"https://emergencemagazine.org/story/this-is-not-a-rehearsal/\">beautiful essay</a> in <em>Emergence</em> magazine last week, in which she suggested that this pandemic is \u201cserving as a flashlight \u2013 illuminating people\u2019s unsteadiest, half-finished parts. It\u2019s showing us where our work remains.

The Dutch theologian Henri Nouwen once described <a href=\"wounds%20and%20pains%20become%20openings%20or%20occasions%20for%20a%20new%20vision\">a healing community</a> as a place not where \u201cwounds are cured and pains are alleviated\u201d, but where \u201cwounds and pains become openings or occasions for a new vision\u201d. I don\u2019t delight in the pain, but I am glad we\u2019re being honest about it.</p> <p>It may be that this medical emergency will offer the space and time for us to focus, for once, on our interior worlds. Because any speculation about the future is redundant unless there is spiritual, as well as medical, healing. Johnny Sertin, founder of a soul-centred consultancy called Becoming, said last week: \u201cWe need another way, another world, but it\u2019s impossible if we cannot do that from a place of being at home with who we are.\u201d</p> <p>As we\u2019re all pondering self-preservation, it\u2019s inevitable that we\u2019re wondering what has been eating us up all this time. Many of the friends I\u2019ve talked to in recent weeks have expressed relief that there\u2019s an enforced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/social-distancing-tips-the-rules-of-safe-shopping-under-coronavirus\">detox from shopping</a>. Many seem to have realised the true nature of consumerism, which is that we\u2019re not only consumers but also being consumed by it. Choice is so limitless that we never make up our minds. All the energy, movement and money to buy stuff and experiences leaves us feeling empty and remorseful. I personally know that every time we drive to the out-of-town shopping mall, built (allegedly) on the proceeds of organised crime, with speakers in the car park blasting the very worst pop music, to buy cheap clobber for the kids \u2013 it rips my spirit.</p> <p>As long ago as 1955, Victor Lebow suggested that we seek \u201c<a href=\"https://sustainablesociety.com/social/consumerism#.XoxVEFNKi9Y\">spiritual satisfaction</a>\u201d in consumption. Acquisition pretends to fill an existential void but only deepens it. We\u2019re constantly engaging in a psychic gorging and purging that leaves us weak and guilty. It\u2019s only during this slow-down that I realise how similar we are to Leonia, the imaginary society described by Italo Calvino in <em>Invisible Cities</em>: \u201cexpelling, discarding, cleansing a recurrent impurity. Street cleaners are welcomed like angels\u201d.</p> <p>It feels as if this crisis is allowing us to glimpse the back office of society, not just those street cleaners, but also the detritus we\u2019re sprinkling every day online. Perhaps it\u2019s because notions of <a href=\"expelling,%20discarding,%20cleansing%20a%20recurrent%20impurity.%20Street%20cleaners%20are%20welcomed%20like%20angels\">personal protection</a> are now at the forefront of our minds, or because talk of biometric monitoring and state surveillance are now being explicitly discussed\u2026 but I feel as if we\u2019ve finally awoken to the truth about the information age: that it\u2019s we who are being informed upon. In an attempt to understand this pandemic, many of us are fixated with statistics, graphs and clusters. But we\u2019re also constantly giving ourselves away. That jittery clicking comes at a cost. As that old adage goes: \u201cWhen something online is free, you\u2019re not the customer, you\u2019re the product.\u201d</p> <p>It seems even more important now, because almost the last distraction now left to us is the internet. All our social rituals \u2013 in pubs, clubs, schools, religious gatherings \u2013 are currently mediated by screens. There\u2019s still idealism in our digital connections, as evidenced by the open-source community\u2019s collaboration on the design or production of medical equipment. But our online habits are being constantly monetised. Writing about surveillance capitalism last week, Simona Guerra, an associate professor of politics at the University of Leicester, said that, just like manual labour of old, \u201chuman activities themselves are sold and bought\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f41c164bd787f13616a56806c69e38df49fa9431\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f41c164bd787f13616a56806c69e38df49fa9431/0_27_3189_1913/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The deserted Gallery Vittorio Emanuele II, Milan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The deserted Gallery Vittorio Emanuele II, Milan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicola Marfisi/AGF/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Because of this crisis we\u2019ve also begun to question the greatest absolutism of the last half-century: the supremacy of the market. It\u2019s become clear, as <a href=\"human%20activities%20themselves%20are%20sold%20and%20bought\">Rowan Williams</a> said to me, that \u201cthe so-called \u2018market state\u2019 is lethally ill-equipped to cope with large-scale collective crisis\u201d. The minimum wages of essential workers, the failure of supply and demand for medical equipment and the sheer cruelty of comments suggesting that the vulnerable could be sacrificed to keep the economy going \u2013 all have revealed the pickpocketing of the market\u2019s \u201chidden hand\u201d and the steepness of its \u201clevel playing field\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s as if the sacred \u201cmarket\u201d has, like a hated dictator, finally been toppled. Instead of our society having a market, we\u2019re realising that the market had our society. Jonathan Rowson, the philosopher and director of the Perspectiva research institute, wrote recently that \u201cthe state\u201d, instead of \u201csocialising and humanising the economy\u201d, had allowed \u201cmarkets to gradually economise and dehumanise society\u201d. Even the <em>Financial Times</em> has been advocating Keynesian, collectivist financial packages. We\u2019re rehabilitating those heretics who have long lamented neo-liberalism\u2019s corrosive effects. The great social theorist Steven Lukes is blunt: \u201cmarket fundamentalism\u201d, he told me, has created \u201cdevastation and unbridled inequalities\u201d.</p> <p>Globalisation has been a large part of the market\u2019s supremacy. The idealistic telling of globalisation was that it was an equitable trading free-for-all which could enrich the poor. The reality, though, has been incessant outsourcing so that our consumables remain as cheap as chips. We\u2019ve come to expect all produce, at all times, in all seasons. Globalisation has been a race to the bottom, which has created semi-slavery at the harsh end of very long supply chains. It has eradicated businesses and jobs close to home and shred local networks of trust and kinship. Like the globe-trotting money, we\u2019ve become frenetically mobile and rootless.</p> <p>But the most naked truth of this crisis is that we can no longer remain in denial about finitude, not just our own as we see mortality close up, but also our planet\u2019s. The Quaker economist Kenneth E Boulding once (allegedly) said: \u201cAnyone who believes in infinite growth on a finite planet is either mad or an economist.\u201d It\u2019s so obvious it\u2019s been ignored for decades. But if this Covid crisis is a dress rehearsal for the climate one, we have seen some of the costs and consequences. \u201cThe case for post-growth economics,\u201d Rowson says, \u201cjust became stronger. We need economies that make sense of 8 billion or so human beings living together in a planetary system as a whole, not the extraction of profit to achieve abstract aggregate targets like GDP.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s long been one of the truisms of modern life that we suffer mythic deprivation. We tell stories, but are never enveloped in one. There has been no belonging and thus no community, no heroes and no quests. Suddenly we have all the above. But it\u2019s not entirely like a film where the heroes would be the medics dying to save us (125 in Italyat the time of writing) and the quest would be the global race to find a vaccine. They\u2019re just a part of this story. Heroism for the rest of us is much subtler and quieter: it\u2019s about restraint and retreat, solitude and stillness. And our quest is perhaps even harder: to discern the common good and look for enlightenment in this darkness.</p> <p><em>Tobias Jones </em><em>is the author of A Place of Refuge</em></p>",
  "<p>Gavin Newsom this week declared himself the leader of a \u201cnation-state\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MaddowBlog/status/1247698364063518720\">Speaking on MSNBC</a>, the California governor on Tuesday announced his state would be amassing more than 200m medical-grade masks per month for health workers on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic. After weeks of competing with other states for critical medical equipment, in the absence of strategy and coordination from the federal government, Newsom said he had had enough. So he harnessed the bulk purchasing power of \u201cthe state of California as a nation-state\u201d to spend nearly $1bn to work with non-profits and manufacturers to deliver masks for his constituents, and possibly other states.</p> <p>The next morning, as <a href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article241860561.html\">#PresidentNewsom trended</a> on Twitter, Newsom once again presented the state he leads as a global power. \u201cWe need to coordinate and organize our nation-state status,\u201d he told reporters at his daily Covid-19 press briefing. California \u201chas been a catalyst to increase supply that will not only avail itself to the state of California but more broadly across this country and potentially in other parts of the globe\u201d, he added.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/why-california-waiting-test-results-backlog-quest-diagnostics\">Why is California still waiting for nearly 60,000 coronavirus test results?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the leader of the nation\u2019s most populous state \u2013 which, Newsom often likes to point out, would have the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy, if it were a sovereign nation \u2013 the governor has often cast himself as a foil to Donald Trump. As the president and the governor bickered, critics in California have lamented that the governor often promised more than he could deliver, and was at times counterproductive by trying to appease too many groups at once. But amid the federal government\u2019s faltering response to the coronavirus crisis, Newsom is getting both local and national recognition for stepping into a leadership vacuum.</p> <p>After identifying its first cases of Covid-19 in late February, California became the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/13/california-coronavirus-response-schools-disneyland\">first US state to issue</a> a widespread stay-at-home order on 19 March. Since then, the state has seen more than 20,000 coronavirus cases and 570 deaths \u2013 but the death toll appears to be rising more slowly than in hard-hit New York and New Jersey. Public health experts have credited the <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-31/coronavirus-social-distancing-west-coast-california-new-york-covid\">state\u2019s foresight</a> in enforcing social distancing. The Trump administration\u2019s response meanwhile, has lagged behind, with the president denying the crisis and delaying action even as the national death toll climbed.</p> <p>Newsom moved into the governor\u2019s mansion in 2018, replacing Jerry Brown \u2013 a prominent figure who had dominated California politics since the 1970s. At 52, he has already had a long career in politics and weathered a fair share of scandal. More than 15 years ago, as San Francisco mayor, he made headlines after he defied national law to marry same-sex couples in California. He made national headlines again in 2007 after it was revealed he had an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/02/us/02newsom.html\">affair with a subordinate</a>, who was also the wife of his chief campaign adviser. At the time, Newsom was separated from Kimberly Guilfoyle \u2013 now an adviser to the president, and the partner of his son Donald Trump Jr.</p> <p>Newsom has tried to cast himself as a young, fresh and progressive leader \u2013 whose Silicon Valley-chic contrasts with Brown\u2019s suits and ties. He has also presented himself as the governor of \u201cthe most un-Trump state in America\u201d \u2013 loudly challenging the Trump administration\u2019s policies on the environment, immigration, healthcare and gun rights \u2013 often on the president\u2019s favorite platform: Twitter. Trump, meanwhile, has relished taunting Newsom as an \u201cincompetent governor\u201d, and obsessing over narrow policies that disproportionately affect California.</p> <p>But amid the coronavirus crisis, rather than fighting the president, Newsom has opted to show him up, in some cases delivering on the president\u2019s empty promises. As Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000007026448/trump-coronavirus.html\">blithely reassured</a>, \u201cJust stay calm. It will go away,\u201d Newsom earned praise from public health experts around the country for enforcing strict, early distancing orders. While Trump beat back pleas from governors to send more of the ventilators needed to treat coronavirus patients, Newsom shipped <a href=\"https://calmatters.org/newsletter/ca-feds-500-ventilators-national-stockpile-new-york/\">500 ventilators</a> to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GavinNewsom/status/1247655661120315393\">seven states</a>. And when the federal government sent <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-29/california-broken-ventilators-silicon-valley-newsom\">faulty equipment</a>, Newsom harnessed the state\u2019s outsized tech industry to quickly fix them.</p> <p>As the federal government stepped back from the crisis, governors including Newsom, Andrew Cuomo in New York and Jay Inslee in Washington found a national audience of Americans looking for steady administration amid chaos.</p> <p>Governors across the country have stepped up, said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic political strategist who has worked for former president Bill Clinton and former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>People look for heroes in times of crisis.

This is all in the spirit of all of us stepping into this moment and doing what we can.\u201d</p> <p>While Cuomo\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK23nfdEVDk\">open, emotional briefings</a> have captivated national broadcasters, Newsom\u2019s shewed, steady strategy through the crisis could pay off, said Amanda Renteria, who was the national political director for the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2016 and a primary challenger to Newsom in 2018. Newsom made \u201ca big statement\u201d when he made California the first US state to order all residents to stay home, Renteria told the Guardian. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be an after-review of how those actions made a difference,\u201d she noted.</p> <p>Already, public health officials are praising Newsom\u2019s early action. Dr Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, has repeatedly held up California as a success story to highlight the effectiveness of distancing measures to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d. Even Donald Trump, who has singled out other Democratic governors as targets during his daily coronavirus briefings, has lauded Newsom. \u201cGavin Newsom has been terrific,\u201d the president <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-13/\">said at a 28 March</a><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-13/\"> briefing</a>. A few days later, Trump again admitted, \u201cThey\u2019ve done a good job, California.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou cannot help but be impressed by his response,\u201d said Bill Whalen, a media consultant for California politicians including the ex-governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, \u201cI\u2019m not by nature a great fan of his agenda.\u201d</p> <p>Newsom\u2019s political career going forward will hinge on how well he\u2019s able to sustain the momentum, as Californians continue to weather the pandemic. Already, the same criticisms of his lack of focus and boundless ambition are starting to catch up to him.</p> <p>His dramatic announcement on national television that he had secured hundreds of millions of medical masks, left many <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-09/gavin-newsom-coronavirus-masks-purchase-california-legislature\">state lawmakers confused</a>, without clarity on the total amount being spent, and without having seen the details of the contracts signed by the administration. And some of the groups that Newsom had apparently included in his deal were blindsided by his announcement.</p> <p>\u201cThe governor has apparently done something extraordinary by making arrangements we were not privy to,\u201d Thomas Tighe, CEO of the California-based not-for-profit Direct Relief, told <a href=\"https://calmatters.org/newsletter/newsom-trump-cuomo-masks-ventilators-supply/\">Calmatters</a>. \u201cBut we\u2019re delighted.\u201d</p> <p>And while California has not seen the surge in coronavirus cases that have overwhelmed cities like New York and Detroit in the past weeks, Newsom has admitted that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/01/california-coronavirus-shelter-in-place-flatten-curve\">delays and huge backlo</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/01/california-coronavirus-shelter-in-place-flatten-curve\">gs</a> in coronavirus testing have left Californians with an unclear image of how, exactly, the disease is spreading through the state. The governor said he \u201cowns\u201d the issues with testing, and has developed a taskforce to correct course.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s rare that elected leaders get real-time feedback on how well they led,\u201d Renteria noted. \u201cBut now people are getting to know their leaders, and paying attention to what they do in that moment of truth.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 15 April 2020 because California issued a stay-at-home order on 19 March, not on 10 March as an earlier version said.

Despairing Italian and Spanish leaders have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/apr/05/europes-future-is-at-stake-in-this-war-against-coronavirus\">warned</a> that the EU itself is at risk of falling apart. We asked experts how governments might still come together to reconstruct a hopeful post-lockdown future for Europe and beyond.</p> \n<h2><strong>Charles Grant</strong><strong>: The shock will be uneven \u2013 this requires a fiscal union</strong></h2> \n<p>Coronavirus has given hope to those who wish to see the EU stumble. Countries have put their own needs first and trust among governments has diminished. A long-running north-south rift over the future of the eurozone risks widening into a deadly chasm.</p> \n<p>The economic depression will hit government revenues and lead to soaring public debt and unemployment. But the virus\u2019s impact will be uneven: some EU states start with loads of debt and rely on industries such as tourism that will be severely affected, notwithstanding the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/eu-risks-break-up-over-coronabonds-row-warns-italian-pm\">compromise</a> that EU ministers signed up to on April 9.</p> \n<p>Several southern countries, and especially Italy, face grim prospects. Italians feel that after the eurozone and migration crises the EU is once again abandoning them. Their economy has scarcely grown since the birth of the euro and public debt is 135% of GDP. The populist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/matteo-salvini\">Matteo Salvini</a> now questions EU membership and is well-placed to win the next election.</p> \n<p>The European commission has struggled to give strong leadership, but most of the key levers on health, borders and the economy remain in national capitals.</p> \n<p>The European Central Bank has come up with an impressive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/ecb-asset-purchase-programme-boosts-euro\">\u20ac750bn bond-buying programme</a>. But ECB action will not suffice. The EU needs to take on a role in fiscal policy. France, Spain and Italy want the EU to issue <a href=\"https://www.cer.eu/insights/proposal-coronabond-pandemic-solidarity-instrument\">bonds guaranteed</a> by the member states. The biggest share of the money would go to the neediest countries, to subsidise spending on health, corporate grants, unemployment pay and investment.</p> \n<p>Eurobonds would mean the better-off EU countries helping to limit dire outcomes in southern Europe. The Germans, Dutch and other northerners oppose, fearing this would discourage weaker countries from undertaking painful reforms. They have a point, but the alternative \u2013 eurozone members sinking into a negative spiral of falling GDP and rising debt, and perhaps exiting the EU \u2013 would be worse for all concerned.</p> \n<p>If the EU cannot respond to Covid-19 by moving towards fiscal union it will lose credibility in many member states.</p> \n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/charlesgrant\">Charles Grant</a> is director of the Centre for European Reform, an independent thinktank</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><br><strong>Shada Islam</strong><strong>: Europe could limit the global damage</strong></h2> \n<p>The way Europe acts today will determine everyone\u2019s post-pandemic future.</p> \n<p>So far, it is not Europe\u2019s finest hour.

As solidarity becomes a hollow mantra, the EU brand is tarnished.</p> \n<p>It doesn\u2019t have to be that way. With US leadership missing in action, the EU could step boldly into the breach in three important ways.</p> \n<p>First, the shock is global. Piecemeal national or even regional responses won\u2019t be enough. European leaders must do what wise leaders did at the end of the second world war: organise another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/nov/14/bretton-woods-1944-keynes-imf\">Bretton Woods</a> moment to build an inclusive system of global economic governance. Western countries no longer call the shots in the real world. </p> \n<p>Second: build a global partnership on health to give the World Health Organization the powers to monitor government health policies and ensure better global exchange of information on health emergencies and pandemics. </p> \n<p>Third: Europe should push for a global humanitarian rescue plan to help countries in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa that lack national capacity, money or medical personnel.</p> \n<p>Debt must be erased and traditional aid policies overhauled. Providing \u201cfree money\u201d or basic income for those in poor countries \u2013 as well as in rich ones \u2013 will need to be considered.

Then, two challenges: how to construct joint economic instruments to address liquidity needs and how to construct a long-term recovery.</p> \n<p>Risk-sharing to address the financial burden is essential. In the longer term, Europe will need a credible recovery plan. But we need to learn from the past: the EU\u2019s obsession with austerity unnecessarily deepened the eurozone crisis and led to massive unemployment. This time, Europe needs to go for a serious investment programme. And it must be used to address the climate crisis and biodiversity.</p> \n<p>Europe\u2019s pandemic recovery needs to be Europe\u2019s green new deal, creating quality jobs in a climate-neutral economy and leading the way to zero pollution.</p> \n<p><em>Bas Eickhout is a Dutch Green MEP</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/comparison\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Brigid Laffan</strong><strong>: This is a psychological crisis but it doesn\u2019t have to be existential for Europe</strong></h2> \n<p>Public health is a matter for national governments, not the EU \u2013 yet much of the coverage of Europe\u2019s response is framed as \u201cexistential\u201d, a test of its survival. But the EU does not command the resources or loyalties that can be called on by nation states.</p> \n<p>It is now trying to harness Europe\u2019s collective capacity. Eurozone finance ministers have put in place three instruments to support workers, companies and eurozone member states. France and Germany were pivotal in averting a damaging breakdown but European leaders will now have to follow up with a \u201ccorona fund\u201d to rebuild health systems and address the longer term economic fallout. This pandemic demands the largest deployment of public finance and public power in peacetime Europe.</p> \n<p>The absence of reliable comparable data on the spread and mortality rates across Europe remains a major problem. The EU also needs to prepare for future pandemics by stockpiling vital equipment and ensuring that it is not dependent on far-flung supply chains.</p> \n<p>Covid-19 is a psychological crisis for individuals, communities and whole countries. The hardest-hit countries need to experience solidarity and know that the cost of recovery will not fall only on them alone. </p> \n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/brigid-laffan\">Brigid Laffan</a> is director of the European University Institute</em><em> in Florence</em></p> \n<h2><br><strong>Vessela Tcherneva</strong><strong>: A new Marshall </strong><strong>Plan and support for </strong><strong>eastern Europe\u2019s brain-drain</strong></h2> \n<p>The coronavirus crisis has amplified the gap between east and west. Central and eastern European governments panicked knowing that their health systems, under-funded and stuck in the 90s, simply could not cope, hence their extremely strict lockdown measures. The crisis is also laying bare the effect of the brain drain from east to west. The EU cannot continue to neglect this problem. If Germany\u2019s success in handling the pandemic is partly down to an army of migrant doctors and nurses, it should not be to the detriment of central and eastern Europe.</p> \n<p>Free movement of labour has also, paradoxically, led to the return home of millions of eastern Europeans. About 200,000 Bulgarians who lost jobs in western Europe have returned home since the beginning of March. Of a working population of 3 million, that is a significant proportion (imagine 5 million Germans suddenly appearing on the labour market or applying for unemployment benefit). Apart from the suspicion that they are importing the disease, the returnees may become a longer-term preoccupation \u2013 and the EU may want to think about common labour insurance system.</p> \n<p>A new Marshall Plan to rebuild post-pandemic Europe could help its economy to bounce back. And we may find that the populist wave has reached its limits and Orb\u00e1n-style power grabs are short-lived.</p> \n<p><em>Vessela Tcherneva is the deputy director of the European Council for Foreign Relations, based in Sofia, Bulgaria</em></p> \n<h2><strong>Rosa Balfour</strong><strong>: Democracy is under threat.

They will, in any case, have to pay for the costs of this pandemic.</p> \n<p>This requires a complete shift in thinking about public investment, where the lessons of postwar Keynesian reform are more relevant than the more recent neoliberal decades.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s not just the economy. Democracy is increasingly under threat. The EU is doomed if it counts authoritarian states among its members. If the populist vision of the EU as a loose union of nations with minimal political integration prevails, it would mark the beginning of a loss of relevance to Europeans and the world.</p> \n<p>The risk of a more inward-looking Europe is high now. But, should the pandemic spread across other regions, there will be demands for western support. If Europe fails to take responsibility, the loss will be felt around the world.</p> \n<p><em>Rosa Balfour is the director of Carnegie Europe</em></p>",

After months of being told of the risks of the coronavirus and accepting the need for the most draconian measures, are people really ready to return to normal?</p> <p>Next week, the European commission will publish a \u201cEuropean roadmap towards exiting from the Covid-19 pandemic\u201d against a backdrop of growing concern in Brussels over the potential for a messy, and deadly, exit from the current restrictive measures.</p> <p>A draft copy of the guidance, seen by the <em>Observer,</em> appeals for member states to lift their restrictions in a coordinated way, guided by science. \u201cAny level of (gradual) relaxation of the confinement will unavoidably lead to a corresponding increase in new cases,\u201d the commission\u2019s document warns.</p> <p>In Denmark, where authorities have contained the virus far more effectively than in many neighbouring countries and the death toll remains below 250, there has nonetheless been anger and disbelief in some quarters at the proposal that primary school children return to class immediately after Easter this week.</p> <p>\u201cMy jaw dropped. I thought they could not be serious,\u201d said Sandra Andersen, a mother of two girls aged five and nine. \u201cI have the feeling that the children are guinea pigs because we don\u2019t know about the virus, and it is constantly evolving negatively,\u201d she told newspaper <em>Politiken</em>. \u201cIt is crazy to send the little ones out first, who don\u2019t understand the rules.\u201d</p> <p>Andersen set up a Facebook page entitled \u201c<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/2845505848837005/\">My kid is not going to be a guinea pig for Covid-19</a>\u201d, which has attracted more than 37,000 members since prime minister Mette Frederiksen made her announcement about the partial lifting of lockdown measures.</p> <p>It is full of posts from nervous parents who insist that they will not send their children back to school, and others from people who accuse Andersen of scaremongering.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There's a lot of excitement because this lockdown has been difficult.

But I can\u2019t show that! I have to be strong. But the little voice in my stomach asks me as a mother: how can you send out a child, in an uncertain world when you don\u2019t even dare to move outside yourself due to uncertainty?\u201d</p> <p>Anders Bockhahn, another member of the Facebook page, who has two sons aged seven and four, said: \u201cYou send children into something you don\u2019t know about. Those with the longest life ahead of them. And I\u2019m scared because nobody knows about the virus and nobody knows what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d</p> <p>The anxiety may be understandable but Christian Wejse, a clinical researcher at the Department of Infectious Diseases at Aarhus University Hospital, insists that the Danish government is being led by science.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe have imposed strong social distancing, it works, and the healthcare system can manage the current workload, so we lift restrictions on the one group in society where data has clearly shown that there is extremely low risk involved,\u201d Wejse said. \u201cAnd we try to keep the virus away from those who will be most harmed. It is not the economy dictating where to open up; it\u2019s the low admittance rate and case fatality rate among the youngest groups.\u201d</p> <p>Back in Grieskirchen, Aslan is enjoying swift business this sunny Easter weekend. Last Sunday, he had about 250 customers and even local TV and newspaper reporters turned up to cover his reopening. \u201cPeople came from the surrounding villages,\u201d his daughter Chiara, 19, said. \u201cThere is a lot of excitement because, of course, this lockdown has been getting more difficult and people need a highlight in their day.\u201d</p> <p>Chiara, an English and geography student at Graz university, says she tries not to worry about the risks as Austria opens for business again. \u201cBut, yes, of course, we all know the disease isn\u2019t defeated,\u201d she said.</p>",
  "<p>\u2018We will not at this stage be checking the items in baskets and trolleys to see whether it is a legitimate necessary item,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j07oLkDYQPo&amp;amp;t=3m16s\">Nick Adderley</a>, chief constable of Northamptonshire, warned last week, \u201cbut if people do not heed the warnings, we will start to do that.\u201d</p> <p>There was a time (just a month ago, in fact) when \u201cpolicing your diet\u201d meant little more than government ads about five a day or Jamie Oliver sounding off about \u201cjunk food mums\u201d. Now we are threatened with an actual police officer standing at the checkout rummaging through our trolley.</p> <p>One should be wary about being drawn into a moral panic over a moral panic \u2013 that, just as the actions of a few people flouting lockdown regulations are turned into a national crusade against rulebreakers, so the comments of a few over-officious police officers come to be taken as the norm. There is no law, even in these surreal times, which sanctions the police to make moral judgments on your shopping. Adderley\u2019s comments were <a href=\"https://talkradio.co.uk/news/priti-patel-lockdown-not-about-heavy-handed-law-enforcement-20040933193\">shot down</a> by the home secretary, Priti Patel, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NorthantsPolice/status/1248238009360793601\">withdrawn</a> by the force.</p> <p>The chief constable\u2019s remarks follow, nevertheless, a pattern of police forces beginning to see themselves not merely as guardians of the law, but also as our moral guardians, from using drones to shame walkers in a deserted national park to defining what is an essential journey. And the question this raises is not just about the boundaries of intrusive policing in the midst of a pandemic, but also about how we might expect to be policed in the post-pandemic world.</p> <p>There is beginning to be talk about what may be the government\u2019s exit strategy from the lockdown \u2013 how and when will we return to a normal state of affairs? The answer depends partly on what we mean by \u201cnormal\u201d. And when it comes to policing, we may well be faced with a \u201cnew normal\u201d.</p> <p>A year ago, China\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/08/business/china-surveillance-technology.html\">social credit score system</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/08/16/data-leviathan-chinas-burgeoning-surveillance-state\">mass surveillance programme</a> were viewed in the west as \u201cOrwellian\u201d. Now they are seen as providing essential tools in the fight against coronavirus.</p> <p>Mass surveillance has allowed the Chinese authorities to track the movements of suspected coronavirus carriers and to identify with whom they have come into contact. As the lockdown is eased in cities such as Wuhan, phone apps have been introduced that classify everyone with a colour code \u2014 red, yellow or green \u2014 that indicates contagion risk and determines <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/01/business/china-coronavirus-surveillance.html\">who can travel</a> or access public space.</p> <p>Other countries have begun to adopt <a href=\"https://www.top10vpn.com/news/surveillance/covid-19-digital-rights-tracker/\">similar techniques</a>. South Korea has been lauded for its mass testing programme. But that programme rests upon an <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-south-koreas-success-in-controlling-disease-is-due-to-its-acceptance-of-surveillance-134068\">intrusive tracking system</a>, using a combination of phone location data, CCTV footage and credit card records to trace people\u2019s movements.</p> <p>The EU has the strictest privacy laws in the world. That hasn\u2019t stopped the European commission from asking telecoms companies to hand over data to allow governments to <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/coroanvirus-covid19-surveillance-data/\">track population movements</a>. In Britain, the NHS is developing an app that traces close contacts of people carrying the coronavirus and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/31/nhs-developing-app-to-trace-close-contacts-of-coronavirus-carriers\">advises them</a> to self-isolate. It may also be used to provide <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/nhs-coronavirus-tracking-app\">\u201cimmunity passports\u201d</a> to those deemed no longer to be at risk. The system will be voluntary, but <a href=\"https://medium.com/@rachelcoldicutt/open-letter-contract-tracking-and-nhsx-e503325b2703\">raises many questions</a> about ethics and personal liberties.</p> <p>These are not normal times and there is a good case for more intrusive policing and surveillance measures to stem a pandemic. But temporary responses to specific emergencies have a habit of becoming permanent, especially, as historian <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/19d90308-6858-11ea-a3c9-1fe6fedcca75\">Yuval Noah Harari observes</a>, \u201cthere is always a new emergency lurking on the horizon\u201d. We only have to look at how 9/11 generated a host of surveillance policies that have since become the new normal.</p> <p>Governments and private companies have long used phone data to track individuals, but the practice has always been contested. The ease with which data sharing has occurred in the pandemic might signal a shift in perceptions. Similarly, the willingness of politicians to make public the private medical details of individuals, from South Korea\u2019s online listing of infected individuals to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/technology/coronavirus-surveillance-tracking-privacy.html\">New York mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s tweet</a> about an individual who had contracted Covid-19, with sufficient information to allow the press <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/03/03/nyc-lawyer-with-coronavirus-in-severe-condition-health-department/\">to out him</a>, suggests the crossing of a previous red line.</p> <p>All this takes place as the relationship between society and the state is being reshaped. From the economic measures announced by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to offset the impact of the lockdown to talk of a new \u201csocial contract\u201d, there are the beginnings of a debate on the changing role of the state in the post-pandemic world. There is much here to welcome, from the recognition accorded to low-paid workers to the possibility of a more robust welfare state. But with a more expansive state, especially against the background of a weaker labour movement and a more quiescent civil society, is likely also to come increased surveillance and more intrusive policing, for our own good, of course.</p> <p>There will be no police officer inspecting your grocery basket, but there will undoubtedly be increased digital snooping. Local authorities and police forces already use data mining techniques to classify individuals and to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/21/technology-has-tempted-us-to-walk-willingly-into-a-modern-panopticon\">predict future outcomes</a> on everything from which child might be in danger to where a crime might occur. Such techniques will only become more entrenched in the post-pandemic world.</p> <p>China has demonstrated how to utilise digital technology to enforce social control. Liberal democracies are adapting those techniques for their own purposes. It may turn a public health emergency into a public order issue, but it won\u2019t stop the next pandemic. A properly thought-out and funded health service and social care system, widespread testing and decent statutory sick pay will do more to mitigate its impact. But it will make liberal democracies less liberal, less democratic, more monitored, more policed.</p> <p>\u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist</p>",
  "<p>In <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/01/the-two-popes-review-anthony-hopkins-jonathan-pryce-netflix\">The Two Popes</a></em>, Fernando Meirelles\u2019s Oscar-nominated buddy movie, the Brazilian director imagines Pope Francis and his retired predecessor, Benedict XVI, now Pope Emeritus, sitting side by side on the sofa watching Argentina play Germany in the 2014 World Cup final. It is a moment of gentle conviviality between Jorge Bergoglio, the down-to-earth activist Jesuit from Buenos Aires and Joseph Ratzinger, the unworldly conservative theologian from Bavaria. But outside the cinema, the two popes experiment has been less of a success. The continuing, and occasionally vocal, presence of Benedict in the Vatican has made him a standard-bearer for traditionalists who are determined to see off Francis\u2019s very different vision of the future of Catholicism.</p> \n<p>Popes tend to both define and be defined by their age. John Paul II turned the Vatican into a powerhouse in the struggle against communism in the cold war era; Benedict became the post-9/11 pope, defender of the faith in the face of a perceived threat to from Islam as well as growing secularisation in the west. Both men were charismatic, polemical and authoritarian, and deeply suspicious of liberal reforming agendas within the church. Benedict in particular battened down the hatches in a spirit of no surrender, as the storms of secularisation and relativism blew beyond the Vatican\u2019s gates.</p> \n<p>To the consternation of his many critics, Francis has thrown open the windows of the Vatican and let some air in. Massimo Faggioli\u2019s fascinating short book, <em>The Liminal Papacy of Pope Francis</em>, tries to explain why. A prominent theologian, Faggioli portrays Francis as a pope fit for the era of globalisation and its discontents. The guiding spirit of this pontificate, he argues, is the conviction that barriers and borders across territory \u2013 and in the mind \u2013 must be reimagined. For Francis, Faggioli writes: \u201cThe border is never just a <em>limes</em> (in Latin, rigid frontier), but also always <em>limen</em> (in Latin, threshold). The liminality of Francis\u2019s pontificate lies in his re-interpretation of the borders ... No boundary can claim to exclude \u2018the other\u2019, since the boundary, by definition, implies \u2018the other\u2019. The border by limiting, also relates.\u201d</p> \n<p>The language is theoretical but in the age of Trump, Putin and Orb\u00e1n, when the cult of the nationalist strongman has returned with vengeance to secular politics, it describes a vision that resonates far beyond the Catholic church. As the first non-European pontiff in modern times, Francis announced himself in Rome as having come from \u201cthe end of the Earth\u201d. Since arriving at Catholicism\u2019s European HQ, he has devolved power away from the Vatican to national bishops\u2019 conferences and local parishes, and made it his mission to champion the rights of the peripheral and excluded in both secular and religious life.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f44dd793-a4d6-4e6b-abf1-8fda776df7fc\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>On his election, 2013</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u201cYou know that it was the duty of the conclave to give Rome a bishop.

In dealing with the migration crisis, or the status of gay people and divorced Catholics in the church, the emphasis has been on the rights and dignity of those deemed outside the boundaries of legitimacy or respectability. Compassion and mercy, key liminal virtues, have replaced judgment and orthodoxy in a new hierarchy of values.</p> \n<p>As the migration crisis turned into a culture war in which Christianity was mobilised on behalf of white nationalism in countries such as Italy, Hungary and Poland, Francis washed the feet of a young Muslim prisoner on Maundy Thursday, visited the island of Lampedusa to highlight the predicament of migrants perishing in the Mediterranean, and transported 12 Syrian families to the Vatican, after visiting refugee camps in Greece. Faggioli quotes Francis in Lesbos in 2016, where he told local Catholics: \u201cEurope is the homeland of human rights and whoever set foot on European soil ought to sense this.\u201d</p> \n<p>Pastoral care counts for more here than doctrinal purity. Faggioli quotes Francis from his letter to bishops, Evangelii Gaudium, in which he states: \u201cI prefer a church which is bruised, hurting and dirty because it has been out on the streets, rather than a Church which is unhealthy from being confined and from clinging to its own security.\u201d The swift decision to move out of the splendour of the Apostolic Palace \u2013 where Popes normally reside \u2013 into a modest Roman guest house for clergy, was an early signal of intent.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f682ee2e5e3e43b06ee37d6bd460794cfe761ac\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f682ee2e5e3e43b06ee37d6bd460794cfe761ac/0_144_2160_1296/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Jonathan Pryce as Cardinal Bergoglio, right, and Anthony Hopkins as Pope Benedict in a scene from The Two Popes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonathan Pryce as Cardinal Bergoglio, right, and Anthony Hopkins as Pope Benedict in a scene from The Two Popes.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Mountain/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The backlash from traditionalists has been furious and concerted. Arch conservatives such as the American cardinal Raymond Burke have taken the grave step of accusing the pope of being in error on matters of church teaching relating to marriage, divorce and communion. After a synod last November on the future of the Amazon, Francis was accused of encouraging idolatry and pantheism by allowing indigenous fertility figures to be exhibited in the Vatican gardens. His passionate advocacy for migrants has led critics to suggest the papacy is turning the Catholic church into a kind of NGO. Vitriolic language and open disloyalty of this kind have not been shown towards a pontiff for centuries.</p> \n<p>As a form of response, Faggioli picks out Francis\u2019s words during a homily delivered to cardinals in 2015: \u201c<em>Compassion</em> leads Jesus to concrete action: <em>he re</em><em>instates the marginalised</em>!\u201d</p> \n<p>In an era of polarisation, division and culture wars, Faggioli believes this passion for those who find themselves on the wrong side of a border makes Francis\u2019s papacy a pivotal one for the age. As walls go up around the world, and the times become increasingly fearful and insular, it is hard to disagree. Academic in style, the <em>Liminal Papacy</em> is not an easy read, but it is an important one.</p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>The Liminal Papacy of Pope Francis </em>by Massimo Faggioli is published by <a href=\"https://www.orbisbooks.com/the-liminal-papacy-of-pope-francis.html\">Orbis Books</a> (\u00a320.93)</p> \n<p><br></p>",
  "<p>For most people, being stuck in lockdown with 11-week-old twins and a 21-month-old toddler would be torture. But the explorer Steve Backshall is used to living in tough and challenging environments around the world. \u201cI\u2019ve spent so much of my life away in a field, sleeping in a tent, that to have this amount of time with the family at home is actually a real privilege. It\u2019s something I don\u2019t get very much.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, it takes more than a few dirty nappies to disconcert a man who is used to defecating in strange places. \u201cEvery single day, scooting off into the jungle to find a place to have a poo could be either the highlight of the day \u2013 or the worst possible moment.\u201d</p> <p>Best known as presenter of the BBC series <em>Deadly 60</em>, Backshall and his television crew recently spent an entire year taking part in 10 expeditions to unexplored places around the world. His book about these experiences, <em>Expedition: Adventures into Undiscovered Worlds</em>, is <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/expedition-9781785943652.html\">out in paperback on Thursday</a>. It offers locked-down readers a chance to experience the untouched rivers, jungles, deserts, waterfalls and caves that Backshall explored for the very first time in history.</p> <p>In Suriname, for example, he spent about six weeks on jungle rivers that \u201cdon\u2019t exist\u201d. At least, not on paper. \u201cThey don\u2019t even occur on the very finest maps of the area we were travelling through. We were writing the maps as we went.\u201d</p> <p>It is to those waterways he goes now, in his mind\u2019s eye, when he wants to remember one of the most amazing sights he ever saw. \u201cWe heard this thundering ahead of us in the forest and we came around the corner to a waterfall that was nearly 100 metres high \u2013 it\u2019s the second-biggest waterfall in the country, and totally unknown. None of the local people or villagers had any idea it existed. We were the first people to map it, the first people to record its existence.\u201d</p> <p>He decided to name it after their Surinamese colleague, Isla. \u201cWe called it the Isla Falls. It pours down through the forest in a series of cataracts, and is really broad and wide as well as high.\u201d</p> <p>On one of the highest promontories of the waterfall, he found fresh jaguar droppings. \u201cIt was clear that, probably as early as the day before, a jaguar had come out and sat at the top of the waterfall where we were standing, looking down at the view. Which was pretty amazing.\u201d There were otters, harpy eagles and tapirs wanderingaround the valley, too. \u201cClearly, they had never seen human beings before. It was just absolutely dazzling.\u201d</p> <p>A Bafta-winning adventurer and wildlife presenter, Backshall had been planning some of the expeditions for more than 20 years. \u201cExpeditions have been my life ever since I was in my late teens. I\u2019ve been putting together this little black book of expeditions that were really special and, hand on heart, had not been done before.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Our desire to push back new frontiers sets us apart as a species ... but I couldn't tell my wife I'd come within a minute of drowning that day</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>They included kayaking along the largest fjord in the world \u2013 in Greenland, the first ascents of desert mountains and descents of desert canyons in Oman, and cave diving in Mexico through passageways that had never been explored. By linking up with several television channels, he got enough funding to put together a tiny team of experts and do them all in a single year. \u201cIt was the hardest year I\u2019ve ever had. Apart from anything else, during that same year, I built a house, nearly went bankrupt and had my first baby. So, all round, a pretty big year.\u201d</p> <p>He almost drowned while making the first-ever descent of a whitewater river in Bhutan in the Himalayas. \u201cIt was so dramatic. This river tumbles down and, over several miles of vertical descent, thrashes its way down through these incredible remote canyons.\u201d He would plummet down a rapid \u201choping to goodness\u201d there wouldn\u2019t be something hideous halfway down. One day, there was. \u201cI basically plunged off the face of the earth into this recirculating wave, a drop of a small waterfall, and the bottom of it caught me and just dragged me back in again.\u201d</p> <p>He was in a plastic kayak about 2.5 metres long and, despite pulling the release cord, was held under the water for nearly five minutes. \u201cBear in mind the water is glacial meltwater, very close to freezing point. I was, without question, drowning. There was nothing I could do to save myself. I was out of energy, out of ideas. It was absolutely terrifying.\u201d Miraculously, a member of his crew managed to battle upstream against the rapids, get a rope to him and drag him out. \u201cShe saved my life.\u201d</p> <p>He drank half a bottle of scotch that night, hoping the whole project would just \u201cgo away\u201d and dreading the thought of getting back into his kayak the next morning. \u201cI remember calling home to Helen, my wife, and she talked for about 15 minutes about missing her junction on the motorway. And I just couldn\u2019t tell her. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to tell her I\u2019d come within a minute of drowning that day.\u201d Their baby was just three months old at the time. \u201cIt was full on. It was really intense.\u201d</p> <p>But he forced himself to carry on. \u201cI knew that if I didn\u2019t get back in that kayak the whole expedition would be over.\u201d</p> <p>He perceives his desire to explore the world as a fundamentally human trait. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the things that sets us apart as a species: our desire to understand, to push back new frontiers. There is an assumption that all of that was done years ago, that there is no more old-fashioned exploration to be done. But there is: you just need to look a lot harder nowadays.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"03a87fbe46f4efaab87ae60b8b3444f5b76e9c06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03a87fbe46f4efaab87ae60b8b3444f5b76e9c06/0_100_8660_5199/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nakhur Gorge, Wadi Ghul, Oman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nakhur Gorge, Wadi Ghul, Oman, is known for its beautiful hiking trails, but there remain desert canyons in the sultanate still untrodden by humans.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ulrich Hollmann/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the desert and the jungle, he felt a deep connection to the explorers of the past, imagining them in their pith helmets, looking for gold and other riches. \u201cBut in other places, not really. For example, cave diving: that\u2019s very much a modern realm of exploration. You\u2019re using modern tech as a way of finding your way into places that people haven\u2019t been to before.\u201d</p> <p>The desert expeditions in Oman were, he says, the most extraordinary. \u201cThere are still desert canyons there where nobody has ever set foot. To be able to head down into one and know that our feet were the first to step on that rock was pretty amazing.\u201d</p> <p>It made him feel his own existence was just one small aspect of something bigger. \u201cOn desert nights \u2013 where the stars just seem to be so close that you could reach up and pluck them, and the silence is so quiet that it\u2019s loud \u2013 you have an incredible connection to the natural world.\u201d</p> <p>Another highlight came when, during ascents of desert rock faces, he managed to record shots of the critically endangered Arabian leopard that was using the same trails. \u201cThere are only a handful of them left. It gave me this incredible sense of privilege, that I was walking in the footsteps of something so rare.\u201d</p> <p>Overall, the year gave him a sense of quite how many natural wonders there are in the world to treasure and protect. \u201cI think it\u2019s incredibly important that people realise there are still parts of the planet we haven\u2019t managed to ruin yet. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/brazil-scales-back-environmental-enforcement-coronavirus-outbreak-deforestation\">It\u2019s our job to make sure they stay beautiful and pristine</a>.\u201d</p> <p>But most importantly of all, it made him appreciate how wonderful it is to be at home in the house in Buckinghamshirefrom which he presents live homeschooling lessons about wildlife every Wednesday at 9.30am on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm-URP49TgSgyIU1rgh2m7A\">his YouTube channel, </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm-URP49TgSgyIU1rgh2m7A\">SteveBackshallOfficial</a>. </p> <p>\u201cI realised how important family is to me.

suggest restrictions could be eased.</p> <p>The NSW chief medical officer, Kerry Chant, has suggested a \u201czigzag\u201d approach that could see restrictions on going outdoors for non-essential purposes eased on a trial basis then reinstated if case numbers increase.</p> <p>Murphy noted that \u201caround the world [countries] have released restrictions and have had to reimpose them\u201d and said national cabinet would not lift restrictions until there are measures including surveillance and tracking to ensure case numbers stayed under control.</p> <p>\u201cBut there is a huge risk in

advice\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAs the prime minister has said, patience is a virtue, and complacency is a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd everyone needs to understand that this is a very fluid and

lifted sooner.</p> <p>\u201cAgain, I don\u2019t have a crystal ball \u2026 We are having a degree of success in flattening out that curve.\u201d</p> <p>Frydenberg said he believed Australia would suffer a \u201csignificant increase in unemployment\u201d due to the \u201csevere economic impact of health restrictions\u201d but business leaders understood the need to follow the medical advice.</p> <p>Frydenberg revealed that 802,000 businesses had applied to access the jobkeeper wage subsidy for millions of employees, while more than 600,000 workers had applied for early access to their superannuation on the basis of financial hardship.</p> <p>He suggested the number of those wanting access to super may shrink, as many had expressed interest before the $130bn wage subsidy program was announced and passed parliament.</p> <p>The treasurer said the government had \u201cno plans\u201d to expand eligibility for the $1,500 fortnightly payment, explaining that a discretion for him to do so without recalling parliament was designed for \u201cunforeseen circumstances\u201d.</p> <p>The Australian Council of Trade Unions and Labor have cited the treasurer\u2019s discretion as the basis for an ongoing campaign for one million casuals with less than 12 months service with their current employer and 1.1 million temporary visa workers to get the payment.</p> <p>Frydenberg revealed it would cost $18bn to add one million casuals to the program, but insisted he intended to use his discretion only \u201cif you needed to implement [the program] in a different way with the [Australian Tax Office]\u201d if issues arose in the implementation phase.</p> <p>Frydenberg said shorter-term Australian casual workers would be eligible for the $1,100 fortnightly jobseeker payment instead, while temporary visa-holders could access their superannuation, continue to work or return home.</p> <p>\u201cAt $130bn \u2026 we had to draw the line somewhere. This is a massive call on the public purse and it is a debt that the country will pay for years to come and at six million people on the jobkeeper program, that\u2019s nearly half the Australian workforce.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if tax increases would be needed to pay back fresh debt, Frydenberg replied that \u201cit will be paid back in the years ahead\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBut, again, we approach this crisis with about a quarter of the debt to GDP ratio of the US, of the UK, and about one seventh of what it is in Japan.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/11/utterly-unjust-why-australian-renters-and-their-landlords-need-certainty-on-residential-tenancies\">'Utterly unjust': why Australian renters and their landlords need certainty on residential tenancies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe way to meet that growing debt burden will be to grow the economy.\u201d</p> <p>Frydenberg said the Liberal party is \u201cthe party of lower tax\u201d and claimed its track record showed it could restrain government spending. \u201cWe are going to have to climb that mountain again.\u201d</p> <p>Frydenberg talked tough about the need to fight Covid-19, which he described as a \u201cfaceless and flagless enemy\u201d but warned that \u2013 despite the prime minister\u2019s call to protect Australia\u2019s sovereignty \u2013 the current crisis is \u201cnot an argument for protectionism\u201d.</p> <p>Earlier, McCormack said \u201cthe recovery out the other side is going to need that [tax reform]\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI think the expenditure review committee and the states will be having a large say in that,\u201d he told Sky News.</p> <p>McCormack claimed the Coalition knew how to \u201cmanage money\u201d but said the federal government would \u201cneed the help of Labor states and territories, through the [Council of Australian Governments] process and the national cabinet being its best self\u201d to manage tax reform.</p> <p>On Sunday the education minister, Dan Tehan, guaranteed that the federal government will pay $18bn in commonwealth grant scheme funding to universities this year regardless of whether they meet the student numbers estimated at the time of the 2019 budget.</p>",

His office said he was improving and was back on his feet although his recovery was still at an early stage. <br><br>Britain imposed a lockdown three weeks ago in a bid to curb the spread of the virus and the government has come under increasing pressure to detail how long the strict measures on movements would last, with people forced to stay at home and many businesses unable to operate. <br><br>Ministers have said Britain needed to pass the peak of the outbreak before changes could be made, and Hancock said although the number of hospital admissions had started to flatten out, there was not enough evidence yet to have confidence they were past the worst. <br><br>\u201cOur judgement is we\u2019re not there yet. We haven\u2019t seen a flattening enough to be able to say that we\u2019ve reached the peak,\u201d he told BBC radio. <br><br>Some scientists have suggested the peak might still be some weeks off but Hancock said \u201cnobody knows\u201d when it would be. <br><br>\u201cThere\u2019s all sorts of suggestions. Their job is to make their best estimate and advise us and we have a whole load of different pieces of advice from different scientists,\u201d he said. <br><br>The death rate is also expected to increase over the next few days, health officials have cautioned, but they say they are hopeful that the lockdown will mean that the overall number of deaths will be below 20,000. <br><br>Initially Johnson took a more modest response to the outbreak than other European leaders but changed tack when projections suggested a quarter of a million people could die in the United Kingdom. <br><br>The government has come under fire for its initial response and a lack of preparedness, and there was criticism on Saturday from doctors and nurses who said they were having to treat patients without proper personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks and gloves. <br><br>Among those to have died after testing positive for COVID-19 are 19 health care workers including 11 doctors. <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e917c4b8f08db3109f20a5e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sarah-marsh\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-11T08:15:35.026Z\">9.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Hello all.
