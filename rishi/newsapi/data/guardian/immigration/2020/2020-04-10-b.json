Like an invisible wave, we won\u2019t see it when it arrives, we will see only its effects.

But right now, the medical questions remain fundamental: when do we know Covid-19 is sufficiently suppressed, how should the restrictions and the lockdowns be eased, and what does a post-Covid world look like?</p> <h2>The risk of relaxing too early</h2> <p>There is danger in complacency. Singapore, for weeks the darling of international comparison, the exemplar of how best to suppress the Covid-19 pandemic, has since seen a dramatic spike in the number of infections \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-singapore/singapore-reports-120-new-coronavirus-cases-in-record-daily-jump-idUSKBN21N0G6\">a 60% jump in new daily infections</a> \u2013 and has announced a further tightening of restrictions.</p> <p>It will now close all schools and most workplaces \u2013 only essential services such as supermarkets and banks will stay open \u2013 for a full month.

But we have to stick it out, because if we relax too soon, and allow the virus to re-emerge and spread widely, all the pain we have suffered will have been for nothing.\u201d</p> <p>There is historical precedent in Australia too. In the immediate aftermath of world war one, Australia was spared the very worst of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2020/apr/09/lessons-from-the-1918-spanish-flu-pandemic\">the Spanish flu outbreak</a>, aided by geography and the delay the steam-ship age afforded a distant continent to implement a strict quarantine regime.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f951538effee068d6e8debd303b9679be886a0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f951538effee068d6e8debd303b9679be886a0c/242_1_1883_1197/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Medical staff and workers from Riley Street Depot, Surry Hills, April 1919.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"636\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Medical staff and workers from Riley Street Depot, Surry Hills, April 1919.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NSW State Archives and Records</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But when the flu did break in Australia, it killed an estimated 17,000 people, and it did so in three waves, the first in February, the second in April. The third wave, in July, was by far the most deadly.</p> <h2>\u2018What\u2019, not \u2018when\u2019</h2> <p>There is an argument that asking \u201cwhen\u201d the restrictions will be lifted is the wrong question. The question that needs to be asked is \u201cwhat?\u201d. What needs to be in place, what needs to have been achieved, before restrictions can be lifted?</p> <p>Scott Gottlieb, a former US Food and Drug Administration commissioner, <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/national-coronavirus-response-a-road-map-to-reopening/\">co-authored a paper with the American Enterprise Institute</a>, proposing a four-phase \u201croad map to re-opening\u201d. The first phase \u2013 in which Australia firmly remains \u2013 is to suppress the spread of the virus as quickly and as comprehensively as possible, to stop the \u201ccurve\u201d from rising to an unmanageable peak that overwhelms public health systems.</p> <p>If there are more critically ill people than there are hospital beds, people who could have been saved will die.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e011dd085f65b59eb9b5955f9d560ce9b9a8e96c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e011dd085f65b59eb9b5955f9d560ce9b9a8e96c/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Royal Melbourne Hospital Intensive Care Unit.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Royal Melbourne Hospital Intensive Care Unit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Hopkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This suppression involves physical distancing measures, banning gatherings, closing public spaces and potentially schools, having people work from home, and limiting all travel.</p> <p>In the second phase, individual states, or even cities, would be able to gradually ease certain restrictions, but only when they have built up their capacity to identify, test and isolate most confirmed Covid-19 contacts and their close contacts.</p> <p>The third phase would allow for remaining restrictions to be lifted when a vaccine is developed, an effective therapy is widely available, or when testing data shows widespread immunity.</p> <p>But there is a fourth stage too. When this pandemic is over \u2013 and it will end \u2013 governments must learn its lessons, and invest heavily in medical research and public health systems. They must prepare for the next one.</p> <h2>A phased recovery</h2> <p><a href=\"https://kirby.unsw.edu.au/people/professor-raina-macintyre\">Dr Raina MacIntyre</a>, a professor of global biosecurity at the University of New South Wales\u2019s Kirby Institute, has argued for Australia to impose a \u201c<a href=\"https://cdn.theconversation.com/static_files/files/978/COVID-Australia_Lockdown_%281%29.pdf?1585710115\">short, sharp lockdown</a> \u2026 followed by a phased lifting of restrictions\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cA short, sharp lockdown of four to eight weeks will improve control of the epidemic in Australia, reduce case numbers more rapidly and bring us to a more manageable baseline from which phased lifting of restrictions and economic recovery can occur.

Immunity certificates could create a two-tiered society of those with antibodies and a measure of immunity who are allowed out, and those without who must remain isolated.</p> <p>They could also create a perverse incentive to catch the virus, particularly among demographics for whom the illness is likely \u2013 though not certain \u2013 to be mild. The certificates, too, have the potential to act as a reward to people who have not adhered to physical distancing and who have developed immunity but at the risk to others\u2019 health.</p> <h2>We are not alone</h2> <p>In the chaos of the coronavirus, the nation-state has reasserted its dominance in the global order. Country is king.</p> <p>The virus has spread quickly because of the modern world\u2019s breath-taking interconnectivity.</p> <p>But the reaction to this rapid global spread has been its antithesis: national governments and their people have turned inwards, closed borders, told foreign nationals to leave, and relied on national leaders and institutions for guidance through the crisis.</p> <p>Countries have formulated and run their responses on strictly national lines. Each country\u2019s \u201ccurve\u201d is compared with others as to whose measures are best (despite the inherent flaws in such comparisons).

That\u2019s very much the approach that I come from,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cI grew up in the constituency I represent, in the eastern valley of the South Wales coalfields, in an era when jobs and opportunities were being taken away by the Thatcher government. And it really did strike me then, that crime was an issue that progressives had to be serious about.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cResponsibility is the word that I would use,\u201d he said. \u201cResponsibility to others, to society: there is such a thing as society, there\u2019s no doubt about that. Crimes have victims; they damage the fabric of that society. But there is a responsibility for government as well, and it\u2019s the responsibility to keep people safe.\u201d</p> \n<p>He was at pains to praise the police officers given the task of enforcing the coronavirus lockdown, despite widely cited instances of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/30/uk-police-guidelines-coronavirus-lockdown-enforcement-powers-following-criticism-lord-sumption\">over-zealousness</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve obviously seen those various incidents that have happened.

But take nurses: when you look at the salary threshold that\u2019s being proposed, nurses, especially when they\u2019re starting off, are below it, and I think the government has to seriously look at how we value people in our society.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"69935b48-c2b3-4b2c-8945-fa8b7bcba6a9\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BS0PhRAx2W8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>He declined to be drawn on what migration system Labour would like to see, saying it would be \u201cfairer\u201d, and that developing it in detail would be an important focus for the party over the next two to three years.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn terms of migration and broad principles, Labour\u2019s an internationalist party.

  "<p>Before we went into lockdown, I was trying to persuade my mother to reduce her contact circle to five. It seems absurd, now that everyone of advanced age and comorbidities has been told to see no one at all, but way back then (three weeks ago), this seemed reasonable. She immediately bartered the number up to six. It was like negotiating with Tony Soprano: there was no way she was coming out of the deal without the upper hand. Then I asked her how she planned to tell the rest of her associates that they weren\u2019t on the list, and she said: \u201cGood heavens, I\u2019m not going to <em>tell </em>them. That would be so rude!\u201d</p> <p>Then the list was reduced to zero, but mysteriously, one of the original six went round anyway to fix her letterbox. I asked what was the point of fixing her letterbox, when the only important letter she was going to get <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-skype-lessons-and-exercise-plans-how-older-people-are-preparing-for-lockdown\">would be from the government, telling her not to have anyone round</a>, irrespective of whether or not she had a defective letterbox. She said she would prefer to have less advice, and be given a lethal injection. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind,\u201d she said, graciously. \u201cI\u201dm not sure whether the main impediment to euthanasia is whether or not you mind,\u201d I observed, extremely calmly and not at all sarcastically.</p> <p>My friend\u2019s mum got a guy round to fix her cutlery drawer, which has been broken for two years. My sister\u2019s neighbour, supposedly in full cocoon, still goes to the shop every day and, when she said she would go for him, he said: \u201cI\u2019m just in and out. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m asking anyone to dance.\u201d Another cocoon-candidate in my life goes out before dawn every morning just to smell the sea, like the bloody French Lieutenant\u2019s Woman. My uncle spent the night before the pubs closed in a Wetherspoon\u2019s, which I disapprove of in 17 different ways. It is very annoying trying to get the people who should take this the most seriously to take it seriously at all. But it\u2019s also sort of a duff judgment to make, because when you have a life-limiting condition, and even before this happened, you already felt like \u2013 in my mother\u2019s words \u2013 a hot-air balloon with a terminal puncture, waiting to hit the ground, it is highly debatable and a completely personal matter whether you want to spend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/which-conditions-mean-that-you-should-isolate-for-12-weeks\">12 of what is </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/which-conditions-mean-that-you-should-isolate-for-12-weeks\">a finite number of weeks completely on your own</a>.</p> <p>Not everyone over 70 is in the same situation. For some, that \u201cunderlying health condition\u201d means they wouldn\u2019t even be admitted to hospital, nor want to be. It simply isn\u2019t possible to adjudicate across the piece, from a distance, as if the elderly were one homogeneous mass.</p> <p>Yet we are all trying to build new rules, at speed, and the easiest way to do so is to constantly, volubly judge each other. Since the sun came out, it has been like a new season of censoriousness. In any normal year, the spaghetti straps would appear and society\u2019s sap would start to rise. This year, it\u2019s a super-charged indignation. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/mar/23/is-it-ok-to-shout-at-strangers-who-arent-social-distancing-absolutely\">Families are furious with joggers, cyclists are furious with bipeds</a>, everyone hates dog walkers, except anyone with a dog, who is wondering why dogless people have to be out at all.

(somebody get <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qk11/episodes/player\">The Moral Maze</a> on the case) \u2013 was less interesting to me than my own bugbear, people with huge gardens and/ or no clue what it\u2019s like to live with a two-year-old and a four-year-old, waxing judgmental about why everyone couldn\u2019t do the responsible thing and remain totally indoors, open a window if they felt so stir crazy. But I got my own comeuppance with that, when I launched full tilt into a fight on Twitter with one of the \u201cjust stay indoors\u201d brigade, only to find that she was quarantined away from her own children, and had been for weeks, because she worked in a hospital. So yes, I was categorically the arsehole.</p> <p>All bets are off, and there are no shortcuts: you cannot possibly guess why that person is behaving the way they are, or saying the things they do. You can\u2019t know what pressures they are under, or whether it was the same or better or worse yesterday. You can\u2019t know what they think about their own mortality, or why. You can\u2019t even know for sure what bubbling tensions are driving your own reactions, until you wake up at 5am, dreaming about Harriet Harman trying to save a sinking island through the medium of dance, and realise it\u2019s possible you are more anxious than you thought. There is really no alternative but to put our own finger-pointing on ice, or under lockdown, if you prefer.</p> <p>My mother, incidentally, was right and there appears to be an unlimited number of people who wish they were on her list-of-zero.

Combine the flour, sugar, salt, egg and yeast together with enough milk to make a soft, but not sticky dough. Knead for 15-20 minutes and set aside in a warm place, covered with oiled plastic wrap or in a bowl with a cloth over until it has doubled in size (roughly 2-3 hours).</p> <p>Once the dough has risen, remove it and flatten it out slightly. Soak the saffron in the warm milk to get most of the colour out. You can then add add your other ingredients. Put the spices, lemon zest, lard, butter, saffron in its milk (which should now be yellow) and currants in the middle, fold it up, and knead again, folding and squeezing so that the new ingredients are well-incorporated (NB: these days you can also just put everything in a food mixer armed with a dough hook!). Cover again, and leave to double in size once more.</p> <p>Lightly grease two baking sheets and shape your dough into 12 equal buns. Round them off and leave in a covered bowl for 20 minutes to double in size once again.</p> <p>Whilst waiting, create a glaze with an egg, a pinch of salt, and 1 tbsp of milk. When ready, brush over each bun. Then, bake in the oven at 180c/350F for 15-20 minutes until each bun is golden brown. Serve on their own, or slathered with butter.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzhQO46suYw\">A YouTube video of Mrs Crocombe making the saffron buns is available.</a></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 13 April 2020 because an earlier version omitted a reference to when to add the butter in the method for the saffron buns recipe.

  "<p>Day 19 of lockdown, and some Britons have identified a greater enemy than even the Wuhan wet market\u2019s snack counter, home to the most maligned bat since <a href=\"https://bleedingcool.com/movies/battle-of-the-batman-val-kilmer-slides-to-bottom-of-bat-poll/\">Val Kilmer</a>. That deadly foe is the 5G rollout, linked by some conspiracists to the coronavirus. Attempts to defeat it have so far seen at least <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/06/at-least-20-uk-phone-masts-vandalised-over-false-5g-coronavirus-claims\">20 5G towers </a>set fire to around the country, hampering emergency communication and the channels used by critical workers responding to the current crisis. Great job, guys! It\u2019s the equivalent of destroying air-raid sirens during the blitz because you heard they turn you Nazi.</p> <p>This wildly mushrooming conspiracy seems driven in part by anti-vaxxers, who\u2019ve apparently tired of endangering lives one way and need a new thrill, a bit like when the Zodiac killer switched from firearms to knives. But only in part \u2013 it also takes in far-right YouTube wingnuts, galaxy-brained celebrities, InfoWars, David Icke, Russia Today\u2026 <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory\">the full catastrophe</a>, basically.</p> <p>We all have newfound respect for supermarkets, though, not simply because visiting one is now the going-out equivalent of hitting a nightclub. I truly salute the staff for adapting to the exhausting demands of our new reality, as well as relaxing their rules on letting in single men. Plus it\u2019s a novelty to meet a breed of doorman who isn\u2019t going to end up in a news report concluding with the words \u201cthe trial continues\u201d. That said, we must as always make a distinction between the supermarket workers and the supermarket bosses. Tesco took \u00a3585m bailout tax relief, and promptly paid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/08/tesco-sales-up-30-per-cent-because-of-pre-lockdown-stockpiling-coronavirus\">\u00a3635m dividends</a> to its biggest investors, some of which are the richest institutions on Earth.</p> <p>In other business news, despite more than 300,000 inquiries, just <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/afd2deb3-cc47-4d57-b5c2-8959d53b4774\">2,500 government-backed loans have been granted</a> . You might have been surprised to learn the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, was surprised to learn banks weren\u2019t lending, despite the fact he\u2019d told them to. Alas, the thing about the banks is that you can\u2019t bank on them. The Conservative party\u2019s relationship with the banks is basically Dot Cotton\u2019s relationship with her son, Nick. Maybe he\u2019s changed this time, you know?</p> <p>Labour news continues to have all the reach of a secret diary. Newly elected leader Keir Starmer has brought back Ed Miliband, the man famously identified as a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/david_cameron/status/595112367358406656?lang=en\">chaos harbinger by David Cameron</a>. Which has turned out to be rather like being identified as slightly creepy by Jimmy Savile.</p> <p>But for better or worse, Miliband\u2019s highest-profile outings in recent years have been as pixels in the notorious Cameron tweet. In the madly accelerated times in which we live, Ed already seems like a relic from a different geological age. If only there was some sort of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdStone\">Rosetta-type stone</a> that might be discovered to help us decipher the ancient times from whence he hails.</p> <p>At least celebrities are leading the lives of anonymity they have always claimed to crave, a piece of wish fulfilment that has forced them to emerge only hourly to invade their own privacy with Instagram videos of them failing winsomely at basic household tasks. If you\u2019ve caught any of these, you\u2019ll be enjoying what amounts to an emergent \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m cleaning!\u201d genre, though will likely side with the washing machine in any content labelled #mywashingmachinehatesme.</p> <p>The question on much of the media\u2019s lips this week has been: how long will the lockdown last? You wonder what\u2019s behind the government\u2019s refusal to give a straight answer along the lines of \u201cmany weeks more\u201d. An aversion to spoilers? Maybe it welcomes the distraction. On Thursday, Dominic Raab intoned that this crisis had \u201cmade us think long and hard about who the key workers are in our lives\u201d. Not that hard, as it turned out. Also on Thursday, the government sneaked out its <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pmdfoster/status/1248253551689773057\">points-based immigration planning</a>, which ranks many of the same \u201cessential workers\u201d somewhere between convicted foreign sex killers and people who tick yes to the visa inquiry \u201cHave you ever been involved in preparing an act of terrorism?\u201d. Or to put it the way the official Home Office guidance prefers: \u201cThere will not be an immigration route specifically for those who do not meet the skills or salary threshold for the skilled worker route.\u201d Forgive me if even mentioning the people getting us through it constitutes some kind of crisis faux pas. For some, ignoring the realities low-paid nurses or delivery workers face is key to the spirit of national togetherness.</p> <p>One of the unwritten conventions of British public life is that no matter how ill-advised or ill-prepared any military action we\u2019ve committed to is, once it starts, you get behind the troops. The government keeps telling us this current crisis is a war, so in the spirit of speaking their preferred language, I guess the troops are us. Not them: they\u2019re the generals. So let me be clear that I\u2019m very much getting behind us, and thank us for our service.</p> <p>But when we\u2019re seeing 1,000 casualties a day - just as we did in Italy while our generals were still deciding not to act \u2013 and grave problems with testing, and NHS staff are crying out daily for the right kit, it\u2019s certainly worth considering whether the troops were led into an ambush. The people dying right now are likely to have caught the disease in the middle of last month (between 11 and 21 March), when the government\u2019s advisers reportedly surmised the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-britain-path-speci/special-report-johnson-listened-to-his-scientists-about-coronavirus-but-they-were-slow-to-sound-the-alarm-idUSKBN21P1VF\">British people would never accept a lockdown</a>. It\u2019s \u2013 how to put this blandly enough not to offend the free-speech snowflakes out there? \u2013 OK to wonder if we might have expected better.</p> <p>Instead, though, there\u2019s a sort of meth-assisted Boys\u2019 Own quality to some of the more obsessive lines of inquiry. This week, there was some focus on whether Dominic Raab had written the so-called \u201cletters of last resort\u201d, replacing the versions of them Boris Johnson wrote when he took office, which contain instructions for who takes military charge in the event of the nuclear obliteration of the government. It\u2019s an interesting question, isn\u2019t it? A thousand people are dying every day and some members of the lobby would very much like to know if Mr Raab has written to a submarine captain.</p> <p>Then again, given the seismic collapse in ad revenues, it looks like all of us journalists are going to need to retrain into different careers after this, so it\u2019s probably good to showcase alternative skill sets. On this evidence, a few would make excellent submarine crew, because they seem pretty relaxed about waiting to find out what the fuck happened until six months after the event.</p> <p>Maybe at some subconscious level, people thought this level of fatality was something that just couldn\u2019t happen in the UK, like winning the Eurovision song contest or becoming a police state. It\u2019s funny how quickly you go from the old certainties to mildly watching <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Alain_Tolhurst/status/1248261411303759872\">Thursday\u2019s clip of the Northants police chief</a> threatening to get his officers to search the contents of people\u2019s shopping baskets for items he deems non-essential.

  "<p>This week is all about big, bold and brave flavours in my house.<strong> </strong>In the crostata, sweet leeks sit alongside punchy taleggio on a buttery walnut pastry with pops of lemon zest, parsley and winter herbs. This tart has enough going on that you could just serve it with a simple green salad. But I think you should double down on big flavours and serve it with these bitter, peppery spring greens dressed with honey, lemon and seeds. There\u2019s a little bit of every flavour \u2013 sweet, bitter, sharp, piquant, verdant \u2013 going on here. </p> <h2><strong>Leek and taleggio crostata (pictured above)</strong></h2> <p>This pastry is really short and crumbly, thanks to the walnuts. I love it this way, but it\u2019s slightly harder to handle than traditional pastry, so don\u2019t worry if it cracks a little: you can always patch it up, and a freeform crostata is best when it\u2019s craggy and homemade, anyway. It\u2019s the kind of thing I make a few hours before people come over and serve just-warm so the flavours can sing.</p> <p>Prep <strong>30 min</strong><br>Chill <strong>30 min</strong><br>Cook <strong>50 min</strong><br>Serves <strong>4</strong></p> <p>For the filling<br><strong>Olive oil</strong><br><strong>6 leeks</strong> (about 900g untrimmed), outer leaves discarded or saved for stock, washed and finely shredded<br><strong>1 bunch thyme</strong>, roughly chopped<br><strong>A few sage leaves</strong>, roughly chopped<br><strong>Salt and black pepper<br>2 garlic cloves</strong>, peeled and chopped<br><strong>1 pinch dried chilli flakes</strong><br><strong>1 tbsp fennel seeds</strong><br><strong>1 tbsp red-wine vinegar</strong><br><strong>3 large eggs </strong><br><strong>20g parmesan </strong>(I use a vegetarian one)<br><strong>1 bunch parsley</strong>, roughly chopped<br><strong>Zest of 1 unwaxed lemon</strong><br><strong>150g taleggio</strong>, rind removed</p> <p>For the pastry<br><strong>50g walnuts</strong><br><strong>200g white spelt flour</strong><br><strong>1 tsp flaky salt</strong><br><strong>100g very cold butter</strong>, cut into cubes<br><strong>2 tbsp ice-cold water</strong></p> <p>First, make the pastry. Put the walnuts into a food processor and blitz until you have fine, uniform crumbs, but keep an eye on it \u2013 if you go too far, they will start to clump together as a nut butter. Add the flour and salt, and pulse a few times to mix everything evenly.</p> <p>Add the butter and pulse a few times until you have a rough-looking dough. With the motor running, add a tablespoon of the icy water and pulse again for four turns of the blade. Take the lid off and pinch the dough with your fingers. Add a little more water if it feels dry and keep blitzing until the dough forms a ball; you want a buttery pastry and that doesn\u2019t feel crumbly. Wrap the dough in greaseproof paper and put in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.</p> <p>Warm a drizzle of olive oil in a frying pan on a medium heat, and add the leeks, thyme, sage and a pinch of salt. Fry for seven minutes, until the leeks are soft and sweet.Add the garlic, chilli and fennel seeds, fry for two minutes to toast the spices, stir in the vinegar and cook for two minutes more. Transfer to a plate to cool.</p> <p>Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Whisk the eggs with a fork, then grate in the parmesan. Add the parsley and lemon zest, season, then break in three quarters of the taleggio.</p> <p>Take the walnut pastry out of the fridge and line a large baking tray with baking paper. Drizzle some olive oil into the centre of the paper. If your baking tray is quite flat, you should be able to roll out the pastry to a 30cm disc about 1cm deep. If you have a standard deep roasting tray, flip it over and put the paper on the underside instead.</p> <p>Stir the leeks into the egg mixture and, working quickly now, spoon into the centre of the pastry, leaving about 5cm around the edge. Gently fold the pastry border back over the vegetables, pleating a little as you go. It will be crumbly and more difficult to handle than other doughs, and may break at its edges, but it will be worth it for the flaky short pastry at the end. Dot the rest of the taleggio on top.</p> <p>Bake in the centre of the oven for 35-40 minutes, until the edges are deep golden and the filling bubbling. Cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes, then slide on to a wire rack to cool and let the pastry crisp up.</p> <h2>Greens with sesame and honey</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ced180b255c42bf53c5a0e8efe6468df97affe8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ced180b255c42bf53c5a0e8efe6468df97affe8a/0_1997_5772_5771/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Jones Easter greens with sesame and honey\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anna Jones\u2019 Easter greens with sesame and honey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Russell/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To turn this into a dinner, you could stir a couple of handfuls of a cooked grain through the greens and top it all with some crumbled feta.</p> <p>Prep <strong>10 min</strong><br>Cook <strong>10 min</strong><br>Serves <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Olive oil<br>2 heads spring greens </strong>(about 400g)<br><strong>2 handfuls peppery greens</strong>,<strong> </strong>such as watercress or rocket (about 60g)<br><strong>2 handfuls bitter greens</strong>,<strong> </strong>such as turnip tops, dandelion, endive, radicchio \u2013 about 100g)<br><strong>Salt</strong><br><strong>Juice of \u00bd lemon<br>4 tbsp sesame seeds</strong>, toasted<br><strong>2 tsp runny honey</strong></p> <p>Put a large pan on a medium heat, and add two tablespoons of olive oil.

Life is harsh, and the halt and lame \u2013 plus those who don\u2019t conform \u2013 are sacrificed so that others might live. Sixteen-year-old Yaz and her younger brother find themselves cast out of the tribe at the Pit of the Missing, literally thrown into a hellish netherworld beneath the polar ice cap. What follows is not only a thrilling fight for survival among the sub-realm\u2019s demons, monsters and lost tribes, but a revelatory coming of age story as Yaz learns the truth about her world and her place in it. <em>The Girl and the Stars</em> is a compelling picaresque that melds fantasy and science fiction to stirring effect.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1320002a2e2b347407e0cde0636b36301631da1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1320002a2e2b347407e0cde0636b36301631da1a/0_0_236_347/236.jpg\" alt=\"The Book of Koli\" width=\"236\" height=\"347\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/15/girl-with-gifts-mr-carey-review\">The Girl With All the Gifts</a></em> author MR Carey shifts seamlessly from fantasy to science fiction with <strong>The Book of Koli</strong> (Orbit, \u00a38.99), an apocalyptic dystopia set in a post-climate crisis world very different from our own. The genetic manipulation of nature has led to man-eating trees and monstrous wild animals. Teenager Koli lives in the enclave of Mythen Rood, a village surrounded by inimical nature and governed by a select few known as Ramparts, an elite who can access ancient technology. In a first-person narrative, the barely literate Koli tells the story of how he craves to become one of the elite, and how his life changes when he steals a piece of technology \u2013 an AI that rapidly becomes a character in its own right. Thrust out into the wilderness, with the wise-cracking Japanese AI as a companion, Koli embarks on a journey as perilous as it is enlightening. <em>The Book of Koli </em>is the enthralling first volume of a projected trilogy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"20ad8b04b0502db7a264c31c6b8534b572c0d6ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20ad8b04b0502db7a264c31c6b8534b572c0d6ee/0_0_225_346/225..jpg\" alt=\"Chosen Ones \" width=\"225\" height=\"346\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In <strong>Chosen Ones</strong> (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a314.99),<em> </em>the first adult novel by the bestselling young adult author Veronica Roth, she ditches the teenage angst of the Divergent series and tackles some seriously grown-up themes. Ten years before the novel opens, five teenagers known as the Chosen Ones defeated an evil entity called the Dark One, whose malign energy created natural disasters that killed tens of thousands of people worldwide. The Chosen Ones had fame thrust on them, and at a cost. Through her heroine Sloane Andrews, Roth examines the psychological effects: empty celebrity and debilitating flashbacks. Ten years after the Dark One was vanquished, a Chosen One dies and Sloane must face the fact that the evil has returned. A skilled storyteller, Roth examines issues of racism and responsibility in a well-plotted supernatural thriller, the first in a series.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5557934cb4146f88ad76d3d24e8076e0296a79db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5557934cb4146f88ad76d3d24e8076e0296a79db/0_0_325_499/325..jpg\" alt=\"Incendiary\" width=\"325\" height=\"499\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Zoraida C\u00f3rdova\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/incendiary-9781473677579.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Incendiary</a></strong> (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a314.99) is another fantasy epic with a plucky but vulnerable heroine: this time a lush reimagining of the Spanish Inquisition spiced with a fascinating magical system.

  "<p>Much has been made of the Football Association\u2019s 50-year ban from 1921 on female players using its affiliated pitches, which scythed down the women\u2019s game just as its growth had accelerated, with matches attracting attendances in excess of 50,000. Little, though, has been said of the eventual lifting of the ban in 1971, or of the man who authored the letter rescinding it.

Born in 1908, he started in student politics, becoming chairman of the University Athletics Union, representing the body on the FA council and being given the job of unpaid FA treasurer before becoming president of the National Union of Students.</p> <p>In those various posts he travelled in the 1930s to Latvia before it was invaded by the Soviet Union and to Madrid as Spain slid towards civil war in 1936, attending student conferences. \u201cIn a lot of domestic ways he was not capable at all,\u201d says Ferris. \u201cHe could just about do tea and toast or boil an egg but in some ways he was a real innovator. He was in his treatment of women. I found an old photograph of a 1930s committee that he was on at the university and a third of the people in the photograph are women.

  "<p>Shhh! That\u2019s not just the wind \u2013 there\u2019s definitely something out there, moving around outside the tent. A lion, perhaps; do they hunt at night? Or a polar bear? I believe they often rip tents apart in order to devour the human occupants. Perhaps it is some<em>one</em> \u2013 a human, a murderer almost certainly. Unless of course it\u2019s just Gatsby, next door\u2019s cat, out on the scrounge again or pooing in our flower bed. Whatever, we\u2019re way too scared to unzip and have a look.</p> <p>We \u2013 my family \u2013 are camping in the garden. I say my family, but it\u2019s just me and the boys, eight and six. Their mum started off with us, but she disappeared after bedtime stories. Her words on leaving the tent? \u201cI\u2019m just going inside; I may be some time.\u201d I think she had planned it.</p> <p>To be honest, it\u2019s a good thing she left. Our four-person tent didn\u2019t fit in our tiny garden. So we put up my old festival tent, cosy for three; even that only just went in. I know, we\u2019re lucky \u2013 especially now \u2013 to have any garden. But I think you could do a version of this even without one. Put a tent up inside. If you haven\u2019t got a tent, make one out of sheets and the sofa cushions, maybe. Use your imagination \u2013 and then again to decide where you are. Alexa, play jungle noises.</p> <p>Why is home-holidaying such a great idea? It\u2019s cheap \u2013 really cheap; almost certainly the cheapest holiday you\u2019ll ever take. No fares, no accommodation, no campsite fees, just what you would have been consuming anyway, plus one bag of marshmallows. You can turn the heating off, too, and anyone still inside can put on an extra layer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5cdc516fb34f91d56d1ec22678a471ddbe3c27a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5cdc516fb34f91d56d1ec22678a471ddbe3c27a/0_0_5152_3864/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sam Wollaston's boys take turns to burn their marshmallows\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sam\u2019s boys take turns to burn their marshmallows.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: provided by Sam Wollaston</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s no added eco-guilt \u2013 this is almost certainly the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/green\">greenest holiday</a> you\u2019ll ever take, too. No flying, no driving, no emissions at all, apart from the ones that children produce anyway \u2013 especially in small tents, it seems. There may be a fire \u2013 but ours was just two bits of wood. Sorry, I suppose it wasn\u2019t entirely necessary, but I think we\u2019ve got some credit in that department.</p> <p>It\u2019s something to do, and something <em>different</em> to do. That has been one of the big problems during lockdown \u2013 the sameness of every day, of the weekdays merging into weekends, of not being able to get out, the lack of any kind of excitement or adventure that doesn\u2019t come via a screen. Garden camping offers proper terror, without putting anyone in danger, although I guess that depends on where you live.</p> <p>It is actually \u2013 amazingly and in spite of everything \u2013 quite fun. Not just doing stuff you do on holiday, and being a bit scared, but simply sleeping in a big pile together. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s transferable inside. Obviously, there\u2019s an upper age limit; if ours were much older, it would almost certainly be the lamest, most ridiculous idea ever. But this time they enjoyed it, the big-pileness of it, being close as a family, talking, having a laugh. Fighting, too, of course, but fighting somewhere new. They want there to be a next time.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They enjoyed it, being close as a family, talking, having a laugh.

No one even knows when the weekends are, let alone remembers when the Easter holidays were meant to be. The normal punctuation of life has gone.

We cooked our pasta inside, but brought it out to eat. We made a fire in the barbecue to burn marshmallows on afterwards. Different people do different things on holiday; we burn marshmallows. Do what you do on holiday, to make it feel (a bit) like one.</p> <p>We also play cards on holiday, so after brushing teeth at the outside tap, that\u2019s what we did: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/nov/22/rules-card-games-old-maid\">old maid</a> and whist. Followed by books. No, we cannot Zoom Mummy \u2013 she\u2019s only been gone five minutes. God, is it really only 8.25pm?</p> <p>It was quite a long night. And a cold one. (The boys were all right \u2013 they shared the air mattress \u2013 but I was on the ground.) And a noisy one. Camping in north-west London, you hear things you might not normally associate with camping, or hear in Wales, say. Not just the prowling murderer/cat, but the Jubilee line, bringing key-worker heroes home. A domestic disagreement (it\u2019s a good way of getting to know the neighbours better). An electric guitar from up the road (\u201cOI, PIPE DOWN, JIMI HENDRIX!\u201d) Also sirens \u2013 lots of sirens \u2013 a sobering reminder of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">what this is all really about</a>.

That means it\u2019s just before five, and not too much longer of this to go. There\u2019s even a dawn chorus of sorts \u2013 the cooing of a London pigeon and something shrill and persistent, an avian alarm call, perhaps. Watch out \u2013 Gatsby\u2019s about. By the time we unzip and emerge, blinking and shivering, the local goldfinch posse is burbling busily at the bird feeder.

In a whole new light, bricks and mortar, heating, beds, porridge.

They \u2013 I \u2013 need a good night\u2019s sleep in a warm bed. We will go again, though, soon. Next Tuesday? Oh, apparently, it\u2019s already in the diary.

Any serious attempt to grapple with China\u2019s role in this pandemic must also consider the specific political-economic conditions of China\u2019s ascent within the global market in recent years, which facilitated the virus\u2019s spread as well as planting the seeds for an Euro-American backlash.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>These dangerous sentiments will not disappear when a vaccine is created, unless we demand more than liberal appeals for tolerance</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Let\u2019s take the claim that the novel coronavirus was caused by a culturally peculiar fondness for eating pangolins. Though it is true that pangolin scales and meat are advertised as a sort of folk medicine in mainland China, statistics suggest the real key variable are the effects of globalisation, which have enriched the country\u2019s business classes. Prices for the animal have <a href=\"https://qz.com/874854/chinas-insatiable-thirst-for-pangolin-scales-is-fed-by-an-international-black-market/\">climbed from $14 </a>a kilo in 1994 to more than $600 today, while illegal shipments confiscated at the border regularly <a href=\"https://www.traffic.org/publications/reports/the-global-trafficking-of-pangolins/\">exceed 10 tonnes</a>. Customers ordering wildlife often do so in order to flaunt their wealth or to celebrate a good day on the stock market, although they remain a minority: <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Cognition-types-and-frequency-analysis-of-Chinese-urban-residents-attitude-toward_tbl1_225329213\">most Chinese citizens</a> support strict limits, if not a ban, on wildlife consumption. Resurgent pangolin consumption is thus a result of economic liberalisation in China \u2013 which the US championed \u2013 not simply of traditional culture.</p> <p>It was <a href=\"https://nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/chinese-virus-world-market/\">these same economic forces</a> that also hastened the spread of the virus overseas. Wuhan, where the virus originated, originally served as a hub between coastal metropolises, such as Guangzhou and Shanghai, and inland China. Although considered a \u201csecond-tier\u201d city, even Wuhan has been caught up in the latest phase of globalisation, as capital pursues cheaper land and labour markets inland. During February and March cases of the novel coronavirus illuminated economic linkages long hidden from view, such as Chinese investments into infrastructure in<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/irans-strategic-partnership-with-china-lies-at-root-of-its-coronavirus-outbreak-11583940683\"> Qom, Iran</a> or the ties between Wuhan\u2019s car parts industry and factories in<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2020/02/how-coronavirus-could-impact-the-global-supply-chain-by-mid-march\"> Serbia, South Korea</a> and<a href=\"https://www.autonews.com/china/webasto-halts-travel-china-after-2-employees-germany-contract-coronavirus\"> Germany</a>. The coronavirus may have first appeared in China, but the ensuing spread and crisis also belong to the global assemblages of commerce, tourism, and supply chains erected by powerful interests in the 21st century.</p> <p>The great irony of blaming some vague notion of Chinese culture is that the best responses to the pandemic have come from the ethnic Chinese majority governments of <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/world/taiwan-who-coronavirus-china/\">Taiwan</a> (five deaths, 380 cases), Singapore (six/1,910), and Hong Kong (four/974). Yes, their responsible policies were due largely to the trauma of the 2003 Sars epidemic but also have to do with the history of robust welfare states in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/opinion/covid-face-mask-shortage.html\">East Asia</a>, which, unlike Europe and the US, have increasingly invested in healthcare infrastructure to deal with precisely such crises.</p> <p>To push back on the anti-China line is not to apologise or defend the state\u2019s actions. It is clear that local officials were wrong to silence <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/chinese-inquiry-exonerates-coronavirus-whistleblower-doctor-li-wenliang\">Dr Li Wenliang</a>, who alerted friends about the virus as early as possible, and that the government has consistently downplayed the virus\u2019s contagiousness and the severity of deaths.</p> <p>But is the contrast between authoritarian and democratic regimes so stark, as<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/02/why-democracies-are-better-fighting-outbreaks/606976/\"> western ideologues</a> allege? Most observers agree that China covered up the crisis in Wuhan for three weeks in January, and this lost time probably decided the difference between a local versus a global epidemic. Nevertheless, it is still sobering to read reports that even from mid-January other governments took even longer to respond: the UK dragged its feet for<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-uk-expert-advice-wrong\"> an interminable eight weeks</a> and the US<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/us-intelligence-reports-from-january-and-february-warned-about-a-likely-pandemic/2020/03/20/299d8cda-6ad5-11ea-b5f1-a5a804158597_story.html\"> ignored clear warning signs for 70 days</a>.</p> <p>This inactivity was partly the product of a western exceptionalism that believed viruses and epidemics only happen \u201cover there\u201d, in poor and non-white countries.

Rather than debate the blame game, as Justice is Global director Tobita Chow has written, we should point out how short-sighted <a href=\"https://fellowtravelersblog.com/2020/04/03/policy-from-the-people-cooperation-in-the-face-of-covid-19/\">nationalist perspectives</a> have produced fatally ineffective responses. During Italy\u2019s worst weeks, officials<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/21/world/europe/italy-coronavirus-center-lessons.html\"> admitted they</a> initially viewed the Wuhan crisis as a \u201cscience-fiction movie that had nothing to do with us\u201d.

Both are the indirect byproducts of China\u2019s emergence as a major force in global capitalism, not only forging the supply chains and travel networks that conveyed the virus but also threatening Euro-America\u2019s centuries-long economic and political prestige.</p> <p>In the US, such fears were already manifest in populist claims that China alone \u2013 and not the domestic political and business class \u2013 was to blame for the loss of manufacturing jobs. In the wake of a referendum result seen as a vote against globalisation, anxieties in the UK have recently been manifest in <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-usa-huawei-instantview/reaction-to-uk-allowing-huawei-a-role-in-5g-network-idUSKBN1ZR1FU\">panic over Huawei</a> providing the country\u2019s 5G network.

For all the responsibility vested in the WHO, it has little power. Unlike international bodies such as the World Trade Organization, the WHO, which is a specialised body of the UN, has no ability to bind or sanction its members. Its annual operating budget, about $2bn in 2019, is smaller than that of many university hospitals, and split among a dizzying array of public health and research projects. The WHO is less like a military general or elected leader with a strong mandate, and more like an underpaid sports coach wary of \u201closing the dressing room\u201d, who can only get their way by charming, grovelling, cajoling and occasionally pleading with the players to do as they say.</p> <p>The WHO \u201chas been drained of power and resources\u201d, said Richard Horton, editor of the influential medical journal the Lancet. \u201cIts coordinating authority and capacity are weak. Its ability to direct an international response to a life-threatening epidemic is non-existent.\u201d</p> <p>At the same time, the international order on which the WHO relies is fraying, as aggressive nationalism becomes normalised around the world. \u201cAll the previous rules about global norms, public health and understanding of what\u2019s expected in terms of an outbreak has crumbled,\u201d said Lawrence Gostin, director of the WHO Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law. \u201cNone of us know where this is leading.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The WHO was born during the moment of hopeful internationalism that followed the chaos of the second world war. The idea of global collaboration in fighting disease was not new \u2013 in the 19th century, at periodic International Sanitary Conferences, countries had standardised quarantine procedures for cholera and yellow fever \u2013 but the WHO constitution, adopted in 1948, envisioned a far grander global mission, nothing less than \u201cthe attainment by all people of the highest possible levels of health\u201d.</p> <p>One of the WHO\u2019s favourite success stories is the role it played in eliminating smallpox, a disease that was still killing millions each year in the 50s, despite the existence of a vaccine. Although the WHO worked on immunisation research, its most vital role was organisational and diplomatic. In 1959, it convinced the Soviet Union to manufacture 25 million vaccine doses, which the WHO would distribute. Not to be left behind, the US donated millions of dollars to vaccination programmes, both directly and through the WHO. By the late 60s, every nation in the UN was sending a detailed weekly report to WHO headquarters on their number of smallpox cases and recent progress. And in 1979, WHO declared smallpox eradicated, a first in world history. The WHO didn\u2019t provide the most money, immunise the most people, or invent key technologies such as the <a href=\"https://www.globalhealthnow.org/object/bifurcated-needle\" title=\"\">bifurcated needle</a>, but it is hard to imagine smallpox having been defeated without it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4044c399a9a92c0ce5d57746c8e2d81421beb2e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4044c399a9a92c0ce5d57746c8e2d81421beb2e4/0_0_4252_2835/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Posters of WHO chief Tedros Adhanom in Sao Paulo, Brazil last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Posters of WHO chief Tedros Adhanom in Sao Paulo, Brazil last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fernando Bizerra Jr/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If the story of smallpox eradication shows the WHO acting as something like an international ministry of public health, it doesn\u2019t explain its current position as an emergency service, surveying the world for disease outbreaks and springing into action to contain them. That is a more recent addition to its portfolio, which came after a period, in the 80s and 90s, when the WHO seemed to be losing its earlier dynamism. The diseases it was partly created to address \u2013 smallpox, yellow fever and the plague \u2013 had either been eradicated or were in decline, and it was slow to identify new threats such as HIV/Aids. Under the leadership of Dr Hiroshi Nakajima, from 1988 to 1998, the organisation stagnated, and some member states complained about poor management and alleged petty corruption.</p> <p>Two things happened at the turn of the century that would shape the WHO we now see tackling the Covid-19 crisis. In 1998, the fiery former prime minister of Norway, Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, was elected director general. And in 2002, a farmer in China\u2019s Guangdong province became sick with a deadly, never-before-seen respiratory disease that quickly spread among the hospital staff who had treated him, and went on to become the first pandemic of the newly globalised 21st century: one that arose suddenly, had no treatment or cure, and spread with the speed and reach of international business.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Given the WHO\u2019s sprawling structure, vague mandate and reliance on diplomacy, its director general holds immense power to shape it. Even before she took on the role, Brundtland was comfortable on the world stage. \u201cI was already a political leader, and I was used to this kind of authority,\u201d she told me. Like her friend Kofi Annan, the charismatic UN leader, Brundtland believed that international bodies should be prepared to lead when necessary, rather than being bossed around by powerful nations. \u201cIf the job is to direct and coordinate global health, it\u2019s not a question of what one or several governments ask you to do,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are working for humanity.\u201d</p> <p>Brundtland pushed the WHO to use its local contacts, diplomatic channels and the emerging internet to locate potential outbreaks, all of which made the organisation less reliant on national governments for information. Within just a few years, this strategy proved its worth. In November 2002, when the Chinese government became aware of the first cases of a novel respiratory disease, later named Sars, it failed to alert the WHO. But, as part of Brundtland\u2019s new approach, WHO staff were monitoring Chinese medical message boards and news media anyway, and were aware of what was then thought to be an atypical pneumonia outbreak. Adding to their suspicions, on 10 February 2003, David Heymann, who was then executive director of the WHO\u2019s communicable diseases cluster, received an email from the son of a former WHO staff member in China warning of a \u201cstrange contagious disease\u201d that had already killed 100 people, but which was \u201cnot allowed to be made known to the public\u201d. The WHO took the information it had to China, which made its first official report to the WHO the next day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fc41769b862cdfb9d6ccd578b4bfef561615bef5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc41769b862cdfb9d6ccd578b4bfef561615bef5/0_0_2000_1386/1000.jpg\" alt=\"WHO director-general Gro Harlem Brundtland (centre) gives polio immunisation to a young boy in New Delhi in January 2000.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"693\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">WHO director-general Gro Harlem Brundtland (centre) gives polio immunisation to a young boy in New Delhi in January 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Mcconnico/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although the WHO had no formal powers to monitor and censure its members, Brundtland wasn\u2019t shy about doing so anyway. In the ensuing months she would accuse China of withholding information, claiming that the outbreak might have been contained \u201cif the WHO had been able to help at an earlier stage\u201d and exhorting the Chinese to \u201clet us come in as quickly as possible!\u201d With remarkable speed, China fell in line and shared its data with the WHO. \u201cAfter her statements to China, no other countries hesitated,\u201d said Heymann.</p> <p>In March 2003, as the disease spread \u2013 reaching Hong Kong, Vietnam and then Canada \u2013 for the first time in its history, the WHO issued <a href=\"https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2003/pr23/en/\" title=\"\">advice against travelling</a> to affected areas. (Before then, the decision to advise on travel had always been left up to member states.) Despite having no formal powers to ground planes, the measures worked. \u201cPassengers and flights dropped dramatically as soon as we issued the recommendations,\u201d said Heymann.</p> <p>Brundtland\u2019s approach was not always popular, and some bridled under this new upstart WHO. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just China,\u201d Brundtland told me. \u201cThe mayor of Toronto [Mel Lastman] flew to Geneva to tell us take down the travel recommendation \u2013 while at the same time he was not containing the outbreak. He had people with Sars riding around the subway, no contact tracing, no following up. He couldn\u2019t accept we were telling him what to do!\u201d</p> <p>The WHO\u2019s response to Sars was considered a huge success. Fewer than 1,000 people worldwide died of the disease, despite it reaching a total of 26 countries. The pandemic was defeated not with vaccines or medicines, but with NPIs, or \u201cnon-pharmaceutical interventions\u201d in WHO parlance: travel warnings, tracking, testing and isolating cases, and a huge information-gathering operation across multiple countries, all made possible by the WHO\u2019s willingness to wield authority that it had, in a sense, created simply by speaking it into existence. \u201cBrundtland did things the WHO had no authority doing. She just did them,\u201d said Fidler. \u201cShe sort of used Sars as a way to test drive some very radical changes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAfter Sars, the WHO\u2019s position was essentially: that was great, let\u2019s formalise it,\u201d said Clare Wenham, a professor of global health policy at LSE. In 2005, the WHO drew up a new version of the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/ihr/about/en/\" title=\"\">International Health Regulations (IHR)</a>, the central legal document that all member states are bound by. According to Fidler, the updated IHR, which is in force to this day, is a radical document. It asks its members to prepare for public health threats according to standards set by the WHO, and to report any outbreaks and all subsequent developments. It also allows the WHO to declare a public health emergency of international concern (or PHEIC, pronounced, incredibly, \u201cfake\u201d), using its own information, over the objection of any single country. During an emergency, countries are expected to take the lead from the WHO\u2019s guidelines and report any deviations to the organisation. All of these requirements, bar the reporting of outbreaks, were new.</p> <p>But the document stopped short of giving the WHO real power if states refuse to comply. \u201cThe WHO isn\u2019t Nato, it\u2019s not the security council,\u201d said Gian Luca Burci, who was the WHO\u2019s legal counsel until 2018. The US, fixated on bioterrorism after 9/11, supported giving the organisation some extended powers, but was opposed by Brazil, Russia, India and China, which were wary of US influence. There was a general reluctance to hand an international organisation any more power. \u201cWHO members were happy with the actions that were taken during Sars, but there was definitely a sense afterward of \u2018What if that was us in China\u2019s spot?\u2019,\u201d explained Catherine Worsnop, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy. In short: thanks for stopping the pandemic, but we don\u2019t want to be told what to do.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>If the WHO has seemed at times weak or tentative \u2013 very un-Brundtland-like \u2013 in its handling of the coronavirus crisis, it is partly because of its bruising experiences during the past decade. From 2009 onwards, the WHO faced condemnation from the press and the international community for its handling of successive crises, all during a decade when the financial and diplomatic order that sustained it began to break down.</p> <p>First, there was the outbreak of H1N1, or \u201cswine flu\u201d. The novel influenza virus was discovered in Mexico in March 2009, and by June, when the WHO declared a pandemic, there were more than 28,000 cases in 74 countries. Over the next year, the WHO coordinated the global response \u2013 less aggressively than during Sars \u2013 and on 10 August 2010, it declared the pandemic over. Almost immediately, the WHO\u2019s approach came under scrutiny. The death toll \u2013 18,500 confirmed deaths worldwide \u2013 was far lower than initially expected, particularly given the disease reached more than 200 countries. \u201cSuddenly you have people saying: \u2018Wait a minute, you really cried wolf on this,\u2019\u201d says Wenham. The media and several prominent European politicians demanded inquiries as to whether the WHO had mistakenly rung the alarm, and \u201ccost huge amounts of money and frightened people unnecessarily\u201d, as Paul Flynn, the former Labour MP who chaired one of the inquiries, told the Times in 2010.</p> <p>To this day, opinions are split as to whether H1N1 was a crisis headed off, or a false alarm. \u201cThe WHO is always at risk of being criticised as doing too much or too little,\u201d said Keiji Fukuda, the former WHO assistant director general who led the H1N1 response. Most of the former WHO staff and academics I spoke with agreed, proposing some version of the following as an iron law of public health: act slowly and you will be criticised for failing to stop preventable deaths; act aggressively and stop an outbreak before it becomes serious, and you will be accused of having overreacted. (After all, in the latter case, nothing too bad happened, so what was the big deal in the first place?)</p> <p>Fidler, who largely approves of WHO\u2019s quick action during H1N1, believes that the backlash led the WHO, which was then under the command of director general Margaret Chan, to become too tentative about calling for action in the future. This was a period when the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis was also starting to take its toll on its budget. \u201cThere was a big funding shortfall,\u201d said Andrew Cassels, director of strategy at the WHO between 2008 and 2013. \u201cCuts made to the emergency response programmes, personnel cuts.\u201d The funding gap stood at nearly $300m in 2012. Entire offices were shut, including a team of social scientists working on pandemic response.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"29cfebe6451704d592d057ee78cfddfd9ae9f240\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29cfebe6451704d592d057ee78cfddfd9ae9f240/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"WHO staff training nurses to use protective gear in Freetown, Sierra Leone during the 2014 ebola outbreak.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">WHO staff training nurses to use protective gear in Freetown, Sierra Leone during the 2014 ebola outbreak.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Duff/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the Ebola outbreak struck west Africa in 2014, the combination of the WHO\u2019s greater caution and reduced budget resulted in disaster. In contrast to the previous pandemic, this time the WHO was slow to act, and was widely perceived to have lost control of the situation. In the end, the US and several other nations <a href=\"https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/newsevents/news/2015/foreign_military_response_crucial_to_ebola.html\" title=\"\">deployed</a> more than 5,000 military personnel at the request of the affected countries, and an ad-hoc UN committee was created to take over responsibilities from the WHO. The outbreak eventually killed 11,310 people, the vast majority in just three countries \u2013 Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone \u2013 paralysing their health systems for months, and causing panic across the world. Prominent scientists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/22/experts-criticise-world-health-organisation-who-delay-ebola-outbreak\" title=\"\">judged</a> the WHO\u2019s response an \u201cegregious failure\u201d.</p> <p>Much of the blame fell on Chan herself. She appeared shell-shocked, stressing to the press that the WHO was a technical advisory body, and that it was national governments that had ultimate responsibility for their citizens\u2019 health. \u201cShe wanted the WHO to be an apolitical agency \u2013 more like technical support. There was a hesitancy there to push the full powers of the WHO,\u201d said Sara Davies, a professor of global health at Griffith University in Australia.</p> <p>The bold, proactive culture established after Sars had seemingly faded. Fidler believes that by delaying calling Ebola an emergency, and thus failing to organise an international response at a crucial moment, the WHO\u2019s leadership had shown they \u201cno longer had any faith in their authority\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Today, under Tedros, the WHO finds itself in uncharted territory. Not only is it facing by far the biggest pandemic in its history, it is also having to defend itself from the nations on which it most depends. \u201cIn my 25-plus years of working on global health issues, I cannot recall the leader of a prominent developed country threatening to punish WHO in the manner President Trump did,\u201d said Fidler, referring to the recent press conference in which Trump suggested putting \u201ca very powerful hold\u201d on US contributions to the WHO. In the same press conference, Trump accused the WHO of concealing information, being too slow to react to the virus, and, above all, showing favouritism towards China.</p> <p>Since the crisis began, Tedros has been repeatedly accused of being soft on China. Senator Marco Rubio recently <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bolton-joins-calls-for-who-directors-resignation-accomplice-to-chinas-massive-coverup\" title=\"\">told</a> Fox News that the Chinese government had \u201cused the WHO to mislead the world\u201d, and claimed that the WHO \u201cis either complicit or dangerously incompetent\u201d. The US senator Rick Scott put it more bluntly, accusing the WHO of \u201chelping Communist China cover up a global pandemic\u201d. (Tedros, meanwhile, has warned of the dangers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2020/apr/09/politicising-covid-19-like-playing-with-fire-who-director-general-says-after-trump-attack-video\">politicising the virus</a>.)</p> <p>Until very recently, the WHO was seen as a relatively neutral arena for China to extend its power. \u201cChina likes to find ways within the global system to give it a leading and benevolent image. The WHO was an uncontroversial place to do it,\u201d said Rana Mitter, the director of the University of Oxford China Centre. No longer. The extent of the initial coverup is still unclear, but there is no question that at least at the local level, Chinese officials knew about the outbreak of a novel disease for weeks before it was reported to the WHO. During that time, Chinese doctors were prevented from speaking out.</p> <p>John MacKenzie, the WHO\u2019s emergency committee adviser, told me that the organisation was \u201ca little misled\u201d about the Wuhan outbreak. He says that by the time the government alerted the WHO on 31 December, scientists in China had already determined via genome sequencing that the outbreak was caused by coronavirus. Yet the government didn\u2019t confirm that until 7 January and the full genome sequence was not officially shared until 12 January. \u201cThat\u2019s very slow,\u201d MacKenzie told me. \u201cFor at least two weeks, we could have been making far more kits and so on for testing.\u201d MacKenzie added that the number of cases officially declared by the Chinese in the first week \u2013 59 in the week ending 5 January \u2013 was \u201cnowhere near as many cases as you\u2019d expect\u201d. (The statistics released by the Chinese government continue to be questioned, with some <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/asia/coronavirus-china-grief-deaths.html?auth=login-email&amp;login=email\" title=\"\">reports</a> suggesting they may have seriously understated the number of coronavirus deaths.)</p> <p>Despite mounting frustrations \u2013 in mid-January, China also refused the WHO\u2019s request to send a team of scientific observers to Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak \u2013 Tedros has never come close to doing what Brundtland did and calling China out. Instead, on 28 January, he had a closed-door meeting with Xi Jinping in Beijing, and two days later, he praised Chinese efforts to contain the disease, declaring that China is \u201csetting a new standard for outbreak control\u201d. That same day, 30 January, the WHO declared a Pheic, and began issuing prescriptions to countries around the world. On 8 February, China finally allowed WHO observers into the country. For Tedros\u2019s supporters, this was vindication of his strategy of keeping China onside. For his critics, it was too little, too late.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"10a09ac53b686e3d6a7da5a1660151fdfce8847e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10a09ac53b686e3d6a7da5a1660151fdfce8847e/0_177_3996_2398/1000.jpg\" alt=\"WHO director-general Adhanom Ghebreyesus with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on 28 January 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">WHO director-general Adhanom Ghebreyesus with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on 28 January 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Naohiko Hatta/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Elected as WHO director general in July 2017, Tedros was supported by a bloc of African and Asian countries, including China, which has considerable influence with those members. (Tedros is himself from Ethiopia, where he served as health minister and then foreign minister between 2005 and 2016.) It was a \u201creally nasty\u201d election, said Davies, in which the powers that have traditionally shaped the WHO, such as the US, UK and Canada, lent their support to one of Tedros\u2019s rivals, the British doctor David Nabarro. During the campaign, Tedros was criticised for having served in a repressive government with a poor human rights record, and one of Nabarro\u2019s backers even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/23/who-elects-first-ever-african-director-general-after-tense-vote-tedros-adhanom-ghebreyesus\" title=\"\">accused</a> Tedros of covering up a cholera epidemic during his time as health minister. (Tedros <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/13/health/candidate-who-director-general-ethiopia-cholera-outbreaks.html\" title=\"\">denied the</a> claim, describing it as a \u201clast-minute smear campaign\u201d, while Nabarro told the New York Times that he had never authorised his team to make this accusation against Tedros.) In response, Tedros\u2019s supporters mounted \u201ca collective pushback\u201d, said Davies, against the UK and its allies, eventually winning out. Tedros became the first director general from a so-called developing country since the Brazilian Dr Marcolino Gomes Candau in 1953.</p> <p>While his background is in politics, Tedros is not forthright or confrontational like Brundtland. In Ethiopia, his political party, the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF) was mostly comprised of ex-revolutionaries, men that \u201cseemed carved out of a rock\u201d, said Fantu Cheru, a professor at American University and former advisor to the Ethiopian government. Tedros was different \u2013 jovial and accessible, said Cheru, and able to make personal connections easily. \u201cHe is not very ideological, he believes he can work with anyone,\u201d said Mehari Taddele Maru, a professor at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy. Cheru also sees Tedros as a pragmatist. \u201cHe\u2019s not in the Chinese pocket. The Americans in particular wanted to destroy his image. Tedros knows how this game works. You need to have more allies than enemies, and those allies may not have a good track record.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Tedros did anything previous director generals would not have done,\u201d said Anthony Costello, the director of the UCL Institute for Global Health. \u201cHe needed a good relationship with China in order to get in.\u201d Even Lawrence Gostin, who has been a prominent critic of Tedros in the past, told me that \u201chis high praise for China is understandable. He is seeking to coax China into cooperation.\u201d He went on to note, though, that this strategy \u201cdoes risk the credibility of WHO as an objective agency.\u201d</p> <p>If the WHO thought it could sacrifice a bit of its credibility \u2013 overlooking China\u2019s obvious blunders in December and January in exchange for its compliance in February \u2013 and move on, it was mistaken. The argument over China\u2019s influence has been raging for weeks, not least since the government of Taiwan <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-taiwan/taiwan-says-who-ignored-its-coronavirus-questions-at-start-of-outbreak-idUSKBN21B160\" title=\"\">claimed</a> that the WHO had ignored its own early reports of human-to-human transmission of coronavirus as part of a larger history of appeasing China \u2013 which has blocked Taiwan from joining the WHO (and the UN) for decades.</p> <p>Now that Trump, scrambling for an answer to explain why the US now has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-world-map-which-countries-have-most-cases-deaths-covid-19\" title=\"\">more cases</a> of coronavirus than any other nation, has alighted upon the WHO and China as his preferred scapegoats, these questions will not go away. \u201cI don\u2019t think we will see the US government cut off funding,\u201d said Fidler. \u201cBut what\u2019s happened with this pandemic \u2013 with the WHO caught between the US/China rivalry \u2013 is not a good omen for the WHO going forward.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>While the focus has been on what happened between China and the WHO in January, in epidemiological terms the crisis has moved on. Covid-19 has spread fastest and furthest in the US and Europe, through the very rich nations that largely fund and staff the WHO. Before the outbreak, the WHO struggled to get these same nations to prepare for future pandemics. Now the pandemic is here, and they are at the centre of the crisis, the WHO has been unable to keep them following its advice.</p> <p>Richard Horton of the Lancet said that after the WHO declared a public health emergency, \u201ccountries, especially western countries, didn\u2019t listen. Or didn\u2019t seek to understand what was actually taking place in China.\u201d On 5 February, the WHO <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/05-02-2020-us-675-million-needed-for-new-coronavirus-preparedness-and-response-global-plan\" title=\"\">asked for</a> $675m to fund its Coronavirus response through to April. Anthony Costello of UCL said that when he met with Tedros on 4 March, the WHO had received only $1.2m. (Tedros announced last week that the funding goal had finally been reached, around the time the number of worldwide cases passed 1 million.)</p> <p>Even the decision to declare a pandemic on 13 March \u2013 a largely rhetorical distinction, since calling a Pheic already requires WHO members to respond \u2013 was calculated to wake its member states up. In the UK the Premier League was still playing games, and the previous week the US had held primary election contests. \u201cThey declared a pandemic because countries weren\u2019t taking the advice,\u201d said Adam Kamradt-Scott, a professor of global health at the University of Sydney.</p> <p>The WHO stresses that the ideal response to the crisis is relatively simple. Individual states should limit public exposure, especially by tracking and tracing all known cases \u2013 a strategy that worked in South Korea and appears to be working in Germany. On an international level, states should share scientific information and resources. These are the mantras Tedros goes back to in his briefings: \u201cTest test test\u201d and \u201csolidarity solidarity solidarity\u201d.</p> <p>But countries have repeatedly ignored WHO advice. In the UK, the response has been erratic, lurching between the WHO\u2019s norms and its own strategies, such as the now-discredited pursuit of \u201cherd immunity\u201d. The US didn\u2019t recommend school closures or avoiding travel until 16 March. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/sweden-prepares-to-tighten-coronavirus-measures-as-death-toll-climbs\" title=\"\">In Sweden</a>, restaurants are still open.</p> <p>Many wealthy nations have not only pursued their own national strategies for public health, but have also withdrawn from the globalised world of diplomacy and trade that they themselves set up.
