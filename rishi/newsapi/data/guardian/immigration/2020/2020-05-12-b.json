Asked about Obama \u201cslamming\u201d the administration for its response to the coronavirus outbreak, he said: \u201cI think President Obama should have kept his mouth shut.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, we know he doesn\u2019t like much this administration is doing. That\u2019s understandable. But I think it\u2019s a little bit classless frankly to critique an administration that comes after you.</p> <p>\u201cYou had your shot. You were there for eight years. I think the tradition that the Bushes set up of not critiquing the president who comes after you is a good tradition.\u201d</p> <p>There is indeed a tradition of former presidents not commenting on or attacking their successors in the Oval Office, but Trump is, to put it lightly, not part of the informal club which currently includes Obama, George W Bush*, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter and has regularly attacked those who went before.</p> <p>Plus, Obama\u2019s views of Trump are pretty well known, if by indirect routes. For example, in a Hulu documentary about Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign against Trump, the Virginia senator Tim Kaine is seen to say the then president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/27/obama-warned-trump-fascist-2016-hulu-film-hillary-clinton-sundance\">thinks Trump is a fascist</a>.</p> <p>In the remarks leaked to Yahoo News, Obama said he would be hitting the campaign trail for Joe Biden this fall. Biden leads Trump in swing states and national polls and Obama is a proven campaigner, to say the least. McConnell is presiding over a Republican Senate majority that looks increasingly at risk. Everything is politics, folks.</p> <p><em>*Fun George W Bush note: the 43rd president is widely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/30/sidney-blumenthal-abraham-lincoln-donald-trump\">reported</a>, while on the podium at Trump\u2019s inauguration, to have leant over to a neighbour after the new president\u2019s dystopian \u201cAmerican Carnage\u201d speech and labelled it \u201csome weird shit\u201d.

He hands out a number of grids to the volunteers, who then study them at their leisure and try to pick out human-made features hidden in the landscapes, such as enclosed settlements. They cross-refer them to records of known archaeology and historic maps to find sites previously missed.</p> <p>Smart said: \u201cI knew there would be enthusiasm within our volunteer group to continue working during lockdown, but I don\u2019t think they realised how many new discoveries they would make.\u201d</p> <p>They have found about 20 prehistoric burial mounds, as well as the remains of hundreds of medieval farms, field systems and quarries.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/16/remains-of-ancient-butchers-beef-up-case-for-redrawing-map-of-roman-empire\">New finds beef up case for redrawing map of Roman empire</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But perhaps the most interesting are the settlements and roads believed to come from just before and during Romano-British times.</p> <p>One of the most exciting discoveries is the remains of a Roman road the researchers believe would have once linked the forts of Calstock, near Tavistock, and Restormel, near Bodmin.</p> <p>The vestiges of the road appear as faint white marks on the aerial image.

Ministers rejected Johnson\u2019s \u201cstay alert\u201d slogan, which has been widely criticised as confusing, and also decided against setting projected dates for loosening restrictions.</p> \n<p>The plan broadly aligned Northern Ireland with Scotland and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/wales-to-remain-in-lockdown-for-at-least-three-more-weeks-coronavirus\">Wales</a>, which have also rejected <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/10/sturgeon-reveals-irritation-over-uk-lockdown-messaging\">Johnson\u2019s new messaging</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe will not be driven by a timetable and we know some will be disappointed by that, but our roadmap doesn\u2019t answer every query, it provides people with an indication of how things might move in the weeks and months ahead,\u201d said Arlene Foster, the first minister and Democratic Unionist party (DUP) leader.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"77142d5a-0bf3-4a80-b538-c47a11b57f6a\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>People over 60 or with health issues should wear a medical-grade mask when they are out and cannot socially distance, according to new guidance from the World Health Organization, while all others should wear a three-layer fabric mask.</p>\n    <p>The WHO guidance, announced on 5 June, is a result of research commissioned by the organisation. It is still unknown whether the wearers of masks are protected, say its experts, but the new design it advocates does give protection to other people if properly used.</p>\n    <p>The WHO says masks should be made of three layers \u2013 with cotton closest to the face, followed by a polypropylene layer and then a synthetic layer that is fluid-resistant. These are no substitute for physical distancing and hand hygiene, it says, but should be worn in situations where distancing is difficult, such as on public transport and at mass demonstrations.</p>\n    <p>The WHO has been reluctant to commit to recommending face coverings, firstly because the evidence on whether they offer any protection to the public is limited and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 because it was afraid it would lead to shortages of medical-grade masks for health workers.</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\">Sarah Boseley</a></b>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Michelle O\u2019Neill, the deputy first minister and Sinn F\u00e9in deputy leader, asked the public for patience. \u201cWhen we\u2019re in position to slowly and carefully move out of the lockdown, we will keep you updated every step of the way,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>The power-sharing executive last week extended Northern Ireland\u2019s lockdown to 28 May and said it would avoid specifying dates for each of the five stages to have \u201csufficient flexibility\u201d to modify the plan in line with scientific advice.</p> \n<p>Matthew O\u2019Toole, the SDLP member of the legislative assembly for Belfast South and a former Downing Street staffer, said: \u201cNo 10 as a machine just hasn\u2019t been set up to think about dealing with devolution, in the way it probably should.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said the infection may have been brought under control more swiftly in Northern Ireland because the public took their lead from Dublin, which announced an earlier, more drastic lockdown than England. \u201cIf the Irish prime minister is saying: \u2018We now need to lock down,\u2019 people will take their cue from that.\u201d</p> \n<p>And he warned of the continued risk of \u201cconfused messages\u201d, as England begins to unwind some of its restrictions.</p> \n<p>Labour\u2019s shadow Scotland secretary, Ian Murray, said: \u201cWe are starting to see England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland pulling in different directions. While devolution naturally means governments can make different decisions, a lack of coordination and clear messaging from No 10 has led to this splintering.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cNot only should the UK government be working in conjunction with all nations, it should be engaging more closely with all regions, local authorities and elected mayors.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Scottish affairs committee in the House of Commons is announcing an enquiry into \u201cthe effectiveness of the four nations approach in tackling the pandemic\u201d. Its chair, the SNP\u2019s Pete Wishart, said: \u201cAs we consider leaving lockdown we will examine the increasing divergence in policy and messaging and consider what impact this will have on the Scottish public.\u201d</p> \n<p>Johnson conceded on Monday that the new guidance was inevitably more complex than the blunt \u201cstay home, save lives\u201d message of the past six weeks. But he suggested the public could be trusted to use their \u201ccommon sense\u201d in interpreting new guidelines about outdoor activities and returning to the workplace.</p> \n<p>Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, expressed concerns about people feeling forced to return to work too soon, after Johnson said some workplaces could \u201cactively encourage\u201d staff to return from Wednesday, as long as they complied with new \u201cCovid-secure\u201d guidance.</p> \n<p>Sturgeon said: \u201cI know that the UK government published guidance for businesses yesterday. That guidance is not operational in Scotland at this stage, since we are not currently encouraging more people to go back to work.\u201d</p> \n<p>She added: \u201cI am very grateful for the fact that the vast majority of employers have been so responsible throughout this crisis, so I am sure that most will do this, and will not urge employees back prematurely.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sturgeon has also echoed the message of the Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, who has said police will patrol the border with England in order to \u201cadvise and explain\u201d to potential holidaymakers that they should return home.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The new advice for England does not permit holiday trips but it does allow the public to travel as far as they want to exercise, fuelling fears that many will flock to beauty spots.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think we have got it right in Wales and I do not think they\u2019ve got it right over the border,\u201d Drakeford said on Monday. Sturgeon agreed, saying: \u201cIt is not OK to drive into Scotland to beauty spots to visit places and for leisure.\u201d</p> \n<p>The prime minister\u2019s approach to communicating his strategy was fiercely criticised by the Tory backbencher Peter Bone on Tuesday, who said Johnson\u2019s aides appeared to think they were running a \u201cpresidential government\u201d and had watched too many episodes of the US political drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jun/22/west-wing-netflix-friends-binge-watching-nostalgia\">The West Wing</a>.</p> \n<p>He accused Johnson of breaking the ministerial code by announcing his plans in a televised address, more than 18 hours before the document was published or MPs were given the opportunity to question him.</p> \n<p>\u201cSpin and presentation don\u2019t make good government: it is parliament that makes good government,\u201d Bone told MPs.</p>",
  "<p>When your luck is out, your luck is out. And right now Matt Hancock can\u2019t seem to buy himself an even break. Dominic Cummings and his cabinet colleagues are lining him up as the fall guy for when the coronavirus crisis eventually ends \u2013 no point getting rid of him any sooner or someone else might have to also take the rap \u2013 and there\u2019s nothing he can do about it.</p> <p>Hell, he doesn\u2019t even get any credit for having survived the coronavirus without much fuss. Brave Boris still <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/01/boris-johnson-is-back-but-has-he-changed-coronavirus\">gets a free pass for having gone into intensive care</a>, but Hancock\u2019s recovery is by and large ignored. He\u2019s just the schmuck that has to suck it up. He\u2019s in way too deep to get away with saying what he\u2019d always really thought: that Johnson was never fit to be prime minister. So he can only look on in envy at Jeremy Hunt for having had an uncharacteristic fit of self-worth by turning down a cabinet job and reinventing himself as one of the good guys. Jezza, the man who did more than anyone to cut back the NHS, now on the side of the angels. Who\u2019da thunk it?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/11/motor-misfires-as-pm-tries-to-steer-away-from-car-crash-of-night-before\">Motor misfires as PM tries to steer away from car crash of night before</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There was a time when Matt\u2019s eyes used to gleam with enthusiasm. When he believed he could really make a difference. That he had a sense of purpose. Tigger used to bounce out of bed, believing he was the man to teach the NHS to sing in perfect harmony. Now he knows better and there\u2019s only furtiveness and suspicion in his every move. Every day can only be worse than the one before. So when he was told he would be doing the morning media round to clean up after Boris\u2019s latest mess \u2013 you\u2019d have thought the prime minister might know the difference <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/may/11/coronavirus-i-hope-hope-hope-we-will-have-a-vaccine-says-boris-johnson-video\">between a virus and a vaccine</a> \u2013 he knew what was in store.</p> <p>Not that Downing Street hadn\u2019t tried to make it easier for whatever poor sap drew the media short straw, by having refused to send a minister to be interviewed by Susanna Reid and Piers Morgan for the past 10 days. But Matt is now so far gone that he views even the comparatively less threatening BBC Breakfast with deep suspicion. All the presenter Louise Minchin wanted were some basic answers to some fairly straightforward questions. Why was it OK to meet in a garden centre and not a garden? Why was it OK for a childminder to look after kids <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/matt-hancock-tries-to-clear-up-confusion-over-coronavirus-advice\">but not other family members?</a></p> <p>Yet right from the off, Matt looked and sounded like a man on the edge. Just one wrong word and his eyes would go ice-cold. There was none of the usual charm, the going the extra mile to make himself plain. Just a series of bad-tempered, monosyllabic grunts. Hell, he was sick of hearing how bad things were for the rest of the country. How about someone think of just how shit he was feeling right now?</p> <p>Things got worse when Hancock moved on to Radio 4\u2019s Today programme where Martha Kearney was being the model of politeness. If <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/dominic-raab-adds-confusion-over-changes-uk-lockdown-rules\">confusing Monday and Wednesday</a> was the worst mistake the government had made then things must be pretty damn good, Matt snapped. A nation blinked. Hancock never does sarcasm in public. No more Mr Nice Guy. And it wasn\u2019t a one-off aberration. He carried on with the same snippiness throughout, before his speech collapsed into meaningless disconnection. \u201cPeople understand the message,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople understand what \u2018stay alert\u2019 means, it means, er, and people understand that together we need to control the virus.\u201d</p> <p>It would have been better for Matt if the interview had been wrapped up there and then. Sadly, he re-found language in time to say we should be jolly proud that only 25% of our deaths had been in care homes, as that compared very favourably with other countries worldwide. Given that 10,000 have died in care homes that must rather imply that our death rate in hospitals and the community must be totally horrific compared with other countries. Whatever. The pathos was tangible. Even when Matt is trying to be helpful he still can\u2019t stop himself from handing over evidence for the prosecution. He is a man so near to the edge he can\u2019t even prevent himself from ganging up on himself. He needs a therapist urgently.</p> <p>Yet quantity theory has a way of evening things out. And Hancock\u2019s bad luck is proving to be Rishi Sunak\u2019s good luck. Everything the chancellor touches turns to gold right now. Which is just as well, as he\u2019s spending money like it\u2019s going out of style. Little more than two months ago, Rishi was earmarked for a B-list cabinet post in the Treasury but after Sajid Javid\u2019s hissy, he has found himself in the top job and blessed with access all areas to the magic money tree. Austerity? What austerity?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>His first Brexit budget proved to be little more than spare change compared with his eight \u2013 or is it nine? \u2013 subsequent coronavirus budgets. Today he was back in the Commons to answer an urgent question on extension of the government\u2019s furlough scheme. And Rishi was all smiles. Because though Boris doesn\u2019t have a clue how to stop the virus he has no qualms about spending money he doesn\u2019t know he hasn\u2019t got. So the chancellor got to take the credit for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/12/uk-furlough-scheme-extended-rishi-sunak-coronavirus\">extending the furlough scheme for another four months</a> at the same rate of 80%.</p> <p>Here his charmed life continued. Because even though there were gaping holes in his statement \u2013 how much of the 80% would employers be expected to contribute? Would bosses use the end of July as an excuse to make some workers redundant? What about the self-employed? \u2013 no one seemed to want to take him up on any of them. Rishi had just casually blown another \u00a350bn. A 40th birthday present to himself. Remember the fuss about the \u00a313bn annual contribution to the EU? No one else does. That\u2019s how deep we\u2019re in the shit. But Rishi keeps floating to the top. When your luck\u2019s in, you ride that train to its very last stop.</p>",
  "<p>The US government has been privately pressing the UK in bilateral trade talks to make a choice between the US and China.</p> <p>The US is seeking to insert a clause that would allow it to retreat from parts of the deal if Britain reaches a trade agreement with another country that the US did not approve.</p> <p>The proposed clause made no mention specifically of China, but is seen by British diplomats in Washington as intended to be a lever to deter closer UK-China relations.</p> <p>It had been seen by the UK as equivalent to the public pressure the US had been placing on Britain not to reach an agreement with Huawei to provide the UK\u2019s 5G telecoms network.</p> <p>Most of the controversy concerning the US-UK trade talks has so far focused on the prices of medicines, food standards and a digital tax.</p> <p>The proposed clause is based on article 30 of the US-Mexico-Canada agreement that locks out non-market economies. Although the UK does not formally oppose such clauses, British diplomats are worried that in the current context it would give the US extensive and unbalanced leverage over UK policy towards China.</p> <p>UK diplomats are more broadly concerned that Donald Trump\u2019s determination to use the coronavirus outbreak as a political stick with which to beat China, and secure his re-election, is going to place the UK government under intense external pressure to side with the US against China. Support for a stronger anti-China posture is growing across Conservative benches.</p> <p>The former chancellor George Osborne said he was nevertheless confident that Boris Johnson was not going to succumb, saying: \u201cCuriously, the member of the cabinet most in favour of engagement with China is the prime minister. He is perfectly prepared to resist some of the pressure from his backbenches.\u201d</p> <p>Osborne, speaking at a Strand Group webinar, added: \u201cMultilateralism is a way for countries to cooperate on shared objectives. You cannot have this and side with the US in isolating China from the global system. It is the longest continuously existing civilisation in the world.\u201d</p> <p>Osborne recalled that when he was chancellor, Johnson, who at the time was mayor of London, accompanied him on a trip to China and fully understood the need for cooperation with Beijing.</p> <p>In a Harvard Kennedy school of government paper jointly written by the former Treasury minister Ed Balls, the authors claim a full trade deal before the US presidential election in November is impossible.</p> <p>They also suggest even a mini-deal might present a dilemma for the UK, since it could draw it into an emerging US foreign and economic policy based on anti-China bilateralism, and so close the door on plans for a global Britain.</p> <p>The paper cites an unnamed UK government official saying: \u201cThe talks could conclude with a political statement that pulls the UK towards an anti-China, anti-cooperative view of the world.\u201d</p> <p>It also cites a UK finance official saying: \u201cThe US government seems to want to use the pandemic to cut off China from the global economy, to onshore manufacturing and redesign the global economy, to reprioritise around security while saying you can\u2019t have China as part of the system because of how they behave.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/commentisfree/2020/may/10/covid-19-isolated-and-alone-britain-has-become-the-sick-man-of-europe\">Covid-19: isolated and alone, Britain has become the sick man of Europe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIs this electioneering rhetoric?

  "<p>Fifteen years ago, when broadcaster Alan Jones was at the height of his career, media academic Graeme Turner headed up a three-year study of talkback radio. It involved listening to a month of Alan Jones\u2019s broadcasts.</p> <p>It concluded that talkback radio \u2013 then in its heyday \u2013 could be democratising, giving neglected people voice and direct access to decision-makers. It could help to construct communities and provide current affairs radio of mass appeal.</p> <p>But Alan Jones was something else again.</p> <p>Turner concluded that in some ways Jones wasn\u2019t a talk<em>back </em>host at all, because he talked too much. He spoke more than any of his competing radio hosts \u2013 taking up 75% of the time he was on air.</p> <p>Even when he took a call from an audience member, Jones would be talking for more than 56% of the call.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/16/malcolm-turnbull-news-corp-is-like-a-political-party-with-the-murdochs-encouraging-intolerance\">Malcolm Turnbull: News Corp is like a political party with the Murdochs encouraging intolerance</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Today Turner, now emeritus professor of media and culture at University of Queensland, sees Jones as having been at the \u201cleading edge\u201d of an important reconfiguration of mass media \u2013 from the purveying of information, to the broadcast of opinion.</p> <p>\u201cIf the thing you care about is the role of media in providing information to citizens to help them understand the world around them, then the displacement of facts with opinion is not helpful,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause so much opinion is at some distance from the facts, and in many cases unapologetically so.\u201d</p> <p>Another aspect of modern media that Jones pioneered, says Turner, was \u201cvengeful campaigning\u201d, now a feature of both shock-jockery and some newspaper coverage. \u201cIt\u2019s not been a valuable part of political discourse in Australia,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Jones began his radio career in the mid 1980s \u2013 before pay television got a grip in Australia, before Fox News started in the United States and before social media provided opinion and dubious \u201cfacts\u201d at the flick of a finger.</p> <p>By early this century, Jones was seen as uniquely influential.</p> <p>This was never only about his audience. He never swayed elections, despite perceptions to the contrary.</p> <p>His radio program was top-rating, but in a crowded market. Even at the height, most Australians and even most Sydneysiders did not listen to Alan Jones. In 2018 his audience was about 480,000 in Sydney, with a secondary audience nationwide gained through syndication.</p> <p>A study by the Australia Institute in 2006 found that Jones listeners were older, more conservative, more authoritarian and more fearful than most Australians.</p> <p>They were more likely to believe fundamental social values were under threat, less likely to see Aboriginal culture as essential to Australian society, and more likely to see obedience and respect for authority as the most important virtues to teach children. They were more likely to see homosexuality as immoral.</p> <p>In other words, not swinging voters. Jones\u2019s influence grew partly because politicians \u2013 particularly John Howard \u2013 used friendly talkback radio hosts to bypass journalists and deliver a message direct to the people.</p> <p>Interviews on talkback would be picked up and reported as news by other media, meaning that politicians were able to both speak to the conservative base and set news agendas without facing hostile questions.</p> <p>For the most part, the views that Jones broadcast would have been in accord with those of his audience.</p> <p>He is a climate change denier, for example. He has been hostile to asylum seekers.</p> <p>But he has also picked fights that don\u2019t easily fit into a left-right mould \u2013 for example his apparent vendetta against the Wagner family, blaming them for the Grantham floods, that ended in a $3.4m defamation settlement. Jones also repeatedly picked sides in murky New South Wales police politics.</p> <p>Sometimes, though, he went against the views of his audience \u2013 for example advocating a legal right to same-sex marriage in 2015.</p> <p>So was he sincere in his perpetual opinions?</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a very good question,\u201d says Turner. \u201cWe never got to talk to him, and without that it is hard to judge.</p> <p>\u201cWe had a sense of a very sophisticated rhetorician \u2026 the rants that he would present were not rants in terms of being undisciplined and disorganised. They were extremely carefully structured, and he would repeat the same set of issues in slightly different ways over hours, and you would think \u2018this is really carefully written\u2019. I admired his skill.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d55adedfad7f78f5d237467babea05cd8186ac4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d55adedfad7f78f5d237467babea05cd8186ac4/0_139_4248_2548/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alan Jones with former prime minister Tony Abbott at the launch of How Political Correctness Is Destroying Australia by Kevin Donnelly in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alan Jones with former prime minister Tony Abbott at the launch of How Political Correctness is Destroying Australia by Kevin Donnelly in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Don Arnold/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jones never confined his influence to the program. As has been most recently revealed earlier this year, throughout his career he has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jan/02/with-best-wishes-alan-what-we-learned-from-alan-joness-furious-letters-to-politicians\">peppered politicians with letters pushing various agendas.</a></p> <p>John Howard, as prime minister, is said to have had staff devoted to dealing with correspondence from Jones.</p> <p>But the times have moved on. Jones is now 79. While he plans to continue his appearances on television and his newspaper columns, whether he can maintain relevance without his traditional base remains to be seen.</p> <p>The lists of times that Jones has been in trouble with the broadcasting regulators and with defamation is too long to reproduce here. Most disturbingly, in 2007 the Australian Communications and Media Authority found that he had encouraged the violence of the Cronulla riots, and the vilification of Lebanese people.</p> <p>In recent years the controversies have increasingly taken a toll on his revenue-generating capacity, due to consumer-driven advertiser boycotts. His misogyny, in particular, has cost him dearly \u2013 such as when he suggested prime minister Julia Gillard should be taken out to sea in a chaff bag, and New Zealand prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/sep/19/my-dear-prime-minister-alan-joness-apology-letter-to-jacinda-ardern-revealed\">Jacinda Ardern should have a sock shoved down her throat</a>, and when he suggested that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/04/australian-radio-host-female-leaders\">women leaders were \u201cdestroying the joint\u2019</a>.</p> <p>But his influence has still been visible. For example, just two years ago NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian gave way to his suggestions that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/07/alan-jones-opera-house-row-sydney-gambling-industry-tim-costello\">the Sydney Opera House be used as an advertising billboard.</a></p> <p>But there is a sense that the audience and the formation of public opinion has moved on.</p> <p>So if Jones was at the leading edge of opinion replacing fact in popular media, where to now?</p> <p>Turner suggests that shock-jockery is moving to pay television \u2013 but the audiences are tiny.</p> <p>The Bolt Report on Sky, for example, is one of its most successful programs and gets just 250,000 viewers across multiple repeats.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/25/alan-joness-radio-show-loses-hundreds-of-advertisers-since-jacinda-ardern-storm\">Alan Jones's radio show loses hundreds of advertisers since Jacinda Ardern storm</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nor do the interviews and views of the SkyNews commentators usually get picked up by mainstream media \u2013 except when they intersect with issues already in the news, such as the travails of Cardinal George Pell.</p> <p>By way of comparison, the weekly Sunday morning ABC Insiders program has 548,000 viewers and its keynote political interview often sets the news agenda for the week.</p> <p>As the generation of shock-jocks to which Alan Jones belongs reaches retirement, the partisanship of SkyNews is not really an equivalent replacement.</p> <p>Instead, the influencers have shifted online, and to the reaches of YouTube and social media.

At the time, Australia was roiling from the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/australian-politics-explainer-the-mv-tampa-and-the-transformation-of-asylum-seeker-policy-74078\">Tampa crisis</a> and Medicare-ineligible refugees and asylum seekers were routinely denied care in the public hospital system. It was possible to find the situation unconscionable without being overtly political.</p> <p>The ASRC needed a volunteer doctor and I said yes, thinking it would be easy work. In quick succession I saw a little boy with a broken arm, a distressed rape victim, a man with uncontrolled hypertension, and a woman with acute asthma, all of whom had been turned away from hospital. The nurse took the little boy to her doctor friend who would plaster his arm at home, and I rummaged through an old carton of supplies to find some antihypertensives and an inhaler. The rape victim fled, confirming that I was not the therapist she needed. I finished my first shift wistful for the controlled environment of my hospital but conflicted that it, and other hospitals, would deny care to sick patients.</p> <p>One afternoon a woman arrived, cradled by two burly men. She was an elderly and frail refugee, riddled with cancer and lately unable to walk. I suspected her unrelenting pain was due to a fractured hip, and I proceeded to do what I did every day at work: provide analgesia, get an X-ray, check some basic bloods. But how? No public hospital would image her hip. The private providers wouldn\u2019t even entertain a call about a refugee.</p> <p>In desperation I called an eminent doctor who said he had no idea how to help and hung up quickly. I could smell his discomfiture \u2013 he knew all too well that the problem wasn\u2019t the fracture but the person who had the fracture. It was one of the most crushing moments of my career.</p> <p>With the patient in severe pain and night approaching, I approached the chief executive of the ASRC, Kon Karapanagiotidis, who had recently founded the non-profit group. He simply said to the hapless family: \u201cWe will never leave her in pain.\u201d</p> <p>I gasped at the magnitude of the promise, and was proven right \u2013 and wrong. The cost of repeated private scripts of morphine would seriously test the organisation, yet he kept his promise and never let on how the finances were driven to the brink. When our patient died, the family seemed almost relieved for our sake. \u201cNow you can save money.\u201d</p> <p>I learned how the issue of refugees divided opinion and sowed fear. One doctor would empathise while another would admonish me for wasting my time on a \u201cnon-academic\u201d pursuit. One pharmacist slipped me a trove of painkillers left behind by deceased patients while another warned me against jeopardising my career over \u201cthese people\u201d.</p> <p>A rare bright spot came when a pathologist, recalling his own refugee background, ran some free blood tests. Unfortunately the abnormalities he found couldn\u2019t be treated outside a hospital.</p> <p>This unforgettable story would become a turning point in my life because it was my first time witnessing the pitfalls of being a refugee with a terminal illness, even in a prosperous country. Some time later my state granted refugees the right to public hospital treatment, sparing subsequent patients the worst indignities even though their plight remained poor.</p> <p>Nearly 20 years later, refugees and asylum seekers face a different problem, the pandemic having left them in a particularly precarious position because they are ineligible for government subsidies. Many were gainfully employed but now there is no work. Others who had moved on from aid find themselves returning for assistance they were proud to have left behind.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9dcb6cfec6f02356181d5affada498643f5b457\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9dcb6cfec6f02356181d5affada498643f5b457/0_605_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two women packing food bags at an Asylum Seeker Resource Centre\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Volunteers are busily packing foods and amenities for home delivery to avoid long journeys on public transport.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ranjana Srivastava</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My colleagues have decided to contribute to the cause of the people who are often our patients and whose stories we know all too well.

The cabbage looks crisp but there\u2019s only half for each bag. It\u2019s either tea or coffee, not both. One bottle of oil. One small pack of sanitary napkins. But it\u2019s the bananas that get me. At home, I often watch the bananas change colour because the kids \u201cforget\u201d to eat them. Then, to assuage the guilt, we mash them and add butter and sugar to bake a cake that may or may not be consumed. The waste is galling and I strive to improve. But now, allocating one sorry banana per bag, I wonder how a mother might explain its lonely presence. Who brings home one banana from a \u201cshopping trip\u201d, which is how a refugee might explain food aid to a young child?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/27/did-my-patient-die-because-he-stayed-in-the-queue-and-couldnt-speak-up-for-himself\">Did my patient die because he stayed in the queue and couldn't speak up for himself? | Ranjana Srivastava</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Outside, a woman has arrived one week early for her fortnightly supply.

  "<p>Imagine mentioning William Shakespeare to a university graduate and discovering they had never heard of him. You would be incredulous. But it\u2019s common and acceptable not to know what an arthropod is, or a vertebrate, or to be unable to explain the difference between an insect and spider. No one is embarrassed when a \u201cwell-educated\u201d person cannot provide even a rough explanation of the greenhouse effect, the carbon cycle or the water cycle, or of how soils form.</p> <p>All this is knowledge as basic as being aware that Shakespeare was a playwright. Yet ignorance of such earthy matters sometimes seems to be worn as a badge of sophistication. I love Shakespeare, and I believe the world would be a poorer and a sadder place without him. But we would survive. The issues about which most people live in ignorance are, by contrast, matters of life and death.</p> <p>I don\u2019t blame anyone for not knowing. This is a collective failure: a crashing lapse in education, that is designed for a world in which we no longer live. The way we are taught misleads us about who we are and where we stand. In mainstream economics, for example, humankind is at the centre of the universe, and the constraints of the natural world are either <a href=\"http://www.rethinkeconomics.org/get-involved/why-reform-the-curriculum/\">invisible or marginal</a> to the models.</p> <p>In an age in which we urgently need to cooperate, we are educated for individual success in competition with others. Governments tell us that the purpose of education is to <a href=\"https://www.innovationunit.org/thoughts/thrive-schools-reinvented-for-the-real-challenges-we-face/\">get ahead</a> of other people or, collectively, of other nations. The success of universities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/03/city-corporates-destroy-best-minds\">is measured</a> partly by the starting salaries of their graduates. But nobody wins the human race. What we are encouraged to see as economic success ultimately means <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/19/life-earth-wealth-megarich-spending-power-environmental-damage\">planetary ruin</a>.</p> <p>Large numbers of people now reject this approach to learning \u2013 and to life. A survey <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/10/britons-want-quality-of-life-indicators-priority-over-economy-coronavirus\">reported this week</a> suggests that six out of 10 people in the UK want the government to prioritise health and wellbeing ahead of growth when we emerge from the pandemic. This is one of the most hopeful results I have seen in years.</p> <p>I believe that education should work outwards from our principal challenges and aims. This doesn\u2019t mean we should forget Shakespeare, or the other wonders of art and culture, but that the matters crucial to our continued survival are given the weight they deserve. During the lockdown, I\u2019ve been doing something I\u2019ve long dreamed about: experimenting with an ecological education.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a29f125e44a29013ec4a3ee1555702bc909fd43\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a29f125e44a29013ec4a3ee1555702bc909fd43/0_148_4128_2475/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Monbiot\u2019s daughter with their ecology painting\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Monbiot\u2019s daughter with their ecology painting.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Monbiot</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I can\u2019t claim to have found it easy, or to have got it all right. As millions of parents have discovered, there\u2019s a reason why people undergo years of specialist education and training before qualifying as teachers. Persuading children to see you as a parent one moment and a teacher the next is especially challenging. But, working with an eight- and a nine-year-old (my youngest daughter and her best friend), I\u2019ve begun to discover that my dream is not entirely ridiculous.</p> <p>I\u2019m not talking about teaching ecology as an isolated subject, but about something more fundamental: placing ecology and Earth systems at the heart of learning, just as they are at the heart of life. So we\u2019ve been experimenting with project-based learning, centred on the living world. We started by constructing a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeorgeMonbiot/status/1256173772949897216\">giant painting</a>, composed of 15 A4 panels. Each panel introduces a different habitat, from mountaintops to the deepest ocean, the forest canopy to the soil, on to which we stick pictures of the relevant wildlife.</p> <p>The painting becomes a platform for exploring the processes and relationships in every ecosystem, and across the Earth system as a whole. These, in turn, are keys that open other doors. For example, rainforest ecology leads to photosynthesis, that leads to organic chemistry, atoms and molecules, to the carbon cycle, fossil fuels, energy and power. Sea otters take us to food webs, keystone species and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophic_cascade\">trophic cascades</a>.</p> <p>We\u2019ve done some fieldwork in soil ecology, an extraordinary and neglected subject, upon which all human life depends. You can study it at home or in the park. It introduces basic scientific principles and experimental design, which then \u2013 as we compare and record the results from different samples \u2013 leads us into various aspects of maths and writing.</p> <p>We\u2019re now making a model landscape, to demonstrate the water cycle, river dynamics, stratigraphy, erosion, soil formation and temperature gradients. To the greatest extent possible, I\u2019m letting the children guide this journey. But because of the circular nature of Earth systems, it doesn\u2019t matter where you begin: eventually you go all the way round. As on many <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/07/education-children-not-feral-enough\">previous occasions</a>, I\u2019m struck by children\u2019s natural affinity with the living world. The stories it has to tell are inherently fascinating.</p> <p>There\u2019s nothing radical about the things we\u2019re learning: it\u2019s a matter of emphasis more than content \u2013 of centralising what is most important. Now, perhaps, we have an opportunity to rethink the entire basis of education. As local authorities in Scotland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/10/scotland-eyes-outdoor-learning-as-model-for-reopening-of-schools\">point out</a>, outdoor learning could be the best means of getting children back to school, as it permits physical distancing. It lends itself to re-engagement with the living world. But, despite years of research demonstrating its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/09/i-feel-ive-come-home-can-forest-schools-help-heal-refugee-children\">many benefits</a>, the funding for outdoor education and adventure learning has been cut to almost nothing.</p> <p>This is the time for a Great Reset. Let\u2019s use it to change the way we see ourselves and our place on Earth. The conservationist <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/round-river-9780195015638?cc=gb&amp;lang=en&amp;\">Aldo Leopold once wrote</a> that \u201cone of the penalties of an ecological education is that one lives alone in a world of wounds. Much of the damage inflicted on land is quite invisible to laymen.\u201d But if everyone has an ecological education, we will not live alone, and it will not be a world of wounds.</p> <p>\u2022 George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>Denying exiled Chagos islanders the right to return to their homes on the Indian Ocean archipelago is a continuing breach of their human rights and not just a historical injustice, the court of appeal has been told.</p> <p>The claim was made on Tuesday in the first legal battle over the territory in a British courtroom since the international court of justice (ICJ) in The Hague <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/25/un-court-rejects-uk-claim-to-sovereignty-over-chagos-islands\">ruled last year</a> that the UK\u2019s assertion of sovereignty was illegal.</p> <p>The latest challenge has been brought on behalf of two former Chagos residents. Solange Hoareau, who was born on the island of Diego Garcia and transported to the Seychelles in the early 1970s, has never received any compensation for her exile. The other claimant, Olivier Bancoult, the leader of the Chagos Refugee Group, who now lives in Mauritius, was born on the island of Peros Banhos in the archipelago.</p> <p>The UK government refers to the islands as a British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT). Between 1,500 and 2,000 native islanders were forcibly deported in the early 1970s so that the largest island, Diego Garcia, could be leased to the US to use as an airbase. They have never been allowed to return home.</p> <p>By a majority of 13 to one, the ICJ \u2013 , the United Nation\u2019s highest court, found that the UK\u2019s decolonisation of Mauritius, of which the Chagos Islands were originally a part, had not been lawfully completed. It said the islands must be handed back to Mauritius \u201cas rapidly as possible\u201d.</p> <p>Although the ICJ\u2019s ruling, commissioned by the UN general assembly, was only advisory, it was a damaging blow to the UK\u2019s international standing and, it is argued, has significantly altered the legal status of the UK\u2019s assertion of its sovereignty.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/02/chagos_islands/giv-3902aWdtyWxAzKvM/\" data-alt=\"Chagos Islands map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/02/chagos_islands/giv-3902aWdtyWxAzKvM/\">Chagos Islands map</a> </figure>  <p>Addressing the court of appeal over a video link on Tuesday, Ben Jaffey QC, representing Hoareau, said: \u201cShe has never received compensation to any extent. No agreement was reached with Chagossians resettled in the Seychelles. If the UK is in effective control of the territory, it is required to observe human rights. There\u2019s no difference in principle between the [status of BIOT] and that of [UK] military bases in Afghanistan or occupied Iraq.\u201d</p> <p>The European court of human rights in Strasbourg has recognised that where states are in effective control of territory, even if it is geographically outside Europe, they can be held liable for breaches of human rights.</p> <p>Jaffey said: \u201cThe UK is in practical control of the territory. If Ms Hoareau wanted to exercise her rights [under the European convention of human rights] she would be arrested. The continued exclusion of Chagossians is a human rights issue, and it\u2019s an ongoing issue rather than a historical one.\u201d</p> <p>Hoareau, who is represented by the law firm Leigh Day, and Bancoult, who is represented by the firm Clifford Chance, argue that a decision taken by the UK government in 2016 not to support resettlement of the Chagossians was unlawful.

The first to discuss the idea were New Zealand and Australia.</p> <p>Nine countries scattered across the world, but united in their successful handling of the virus are also actively seeking ways of setting up travel bubbles or corridors, broadening an unlikely alliance.</p> <p>In their second meeting via teleconference on Thursday, the leaders of Austria, Greece, Israel, Norway, Denmark, the Czech Republic, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand agreed that as each begins to ease restrictions they could capitalise on low infection rates by creating tourism safe zones.</p> <p>Israel, Greece and Cyprus \u2013 tourist-dependent nations \u2013 are already discussing the idea in the eastern Mediterranean, and hoping to partially open up from July. On Wednesday the European commission <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/eu-reopen-borders-tourists-covid-19-recovery-plan\">is expected to recommend</a> a three-phase approach to reopening borders that brings together member states with \u201csimilar overall risk profiles\u201d.</p> <p>Any reopening would be very gradual however, with authorities prepared to shut back back down if the virus re-emerges.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b3bb0f88b67ab4f1a0b9aa44b3d081898913baf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b3bb0f88b67ab4f1a0b9aa44b3d081898913baf/0_0_4552_2936/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Passengers walk through the United Airlines terminal at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, Texas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"645\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Passengers walk through the United Airlines terminal at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, Texas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cA month in an epidemic is a very long time,\u201d said Cyprus\u2019 chief virologist professor Leondios Kostrikis.</p> <p>And beyond these bubbles, travel is likely to be severely curtailed either by outright bans, or by quarantine rules. The UK, a laggard on quarantining by international standards, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-lockdown-what-has-boris-johnson-announced\">outlined its own plans at the weekend</a>. The incubation period of the disease means most countries are requiring two weeks isolation on arrival.</p> <p>If that is enforced in both departure and destination countries, it would mean a month under lockdown in total, in order for travellers to spend any time working or relaxing somewhere else \u2013 effectively putting an end to most business and tourism travel.</p> <p>These partial or total closures, while they may protect public health, come with a huge economic cost to countries dependent on tourism or other types of travel, like international students flying in for a university education. That burden might help attempts to reaccelerate opening of borders.</p> <p>\u201cFor a place like Hawaii or Iceland, or maybe New Zealand, you are talking about pretty dramatically restructuring your economy not to be dependent on inter-state or international tourism [and travel],\u201d said Wiley.</p> <p>\u201cYou can protect yourselves by isolating the entire jurisdiction, but then you have to think through how you restructure your whole economy if you aren\u2019t going to allow travel.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb9fae6c6050fee125c7282e0aac0d0254de3c4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb9fae6c6050fee125c7282e0aac0d0254de3c4b/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People observe social distancing on a shuttle bus at Franjo Tudjman Airport in Zagreb, Croatia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People observe social distancing on a shuttle bus at Franjo Tudjman Airport in Zagreb, Croatia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xinhua/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet even partial, controlled re-opening to travel carries risks. The disease\u2019s long incubation period means the most up-to-date information on current infections may still miss the latest clusters; countries that seem disease free may be nursing fresh undetected infections.</p> <p>New York\u2019s outbreak provides a recent example of how ineffective travel bans can be; it appears to have been driven by cases from Italy, brought in after the US government halted entry of people coming from China but not from Europe.</p> <p>\u201cMy worry is that travel bans become a distraction from appropriately managing local transmission, that\u2019s what happened in the US, where we could have had a policy of \u2018test trace, isolate\u2019, and the focus was on the travel bans instead,\u201d said Alex Phelan, professor at Georgetown University Centre for Global Health, Science and Security.</p> <p>\u201cAs it demonstrated, if you are going to be putting bans in place against countries, you are always going to be acting on data that is out of date.\u201d</p> <p>And no travel ban is absolute; global supply chains mean people will continue travelling to transport goods, and most land borders are somewhat porous, so viruses can slip across with smuggled goods.</p> <p>\u201cWe human beings often have tried to forestall epidemics by shuttering, by drawing up the drawbridge, and there is no question that travel can spread some types of disease. But it\u2019s also much harder than we imagine to contain,\u201d said Wendy Parmet professor of law, public policy and urban affairs at Northeastern University.</p> <p>\u201cThis virus is extraordinarily contagious. New Zealand is an island (nation), they may be the one place that can. I certainly don\u2019t think the US can, or the countries on the Eurasian continent can.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73ab245cde900e06c9845aad3ce7918eccafe9ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73ab245cde900e06c9845aad3ce7918eccafe9ec/0_2_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman wears a face mask as she walks past the Colosseum in Rome.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman wears a face mask as she walks past the Colosseum in Rome.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Massimo Percossi/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other options to try to restart travel before a vaccine is developed could include tests shortly before travel either for antibodies to prove immunity, or for the disease itself to prevent infected people travelling.</p> <p>There is precedent for requiring either immunity or virus-free status for travel; travellers coming from places with yellow fever are <a href=\"https://www.who.int/ith/ith_country_list.pdf\">required to have a vaccination certificate</a> for the disease to enter countries from Australia to India and Mexico.</p> <p>At a time of concern about the climate impact of flying, there are suggestions that some of the slide in travel could and should become permanent. And some businesses are already embracing the savings in costs and carbon that have been forced on them.</p> <p>\u201cWe had over 4 billion air passengers globally before the lockdown,\u201d said Monika B\u00fcscher, professor of sociology at Lancaster University, whose research work includes decarbonisation of transport. \u201cNow all the business travellers are learning to zoom, and business analysts suggest that 25% to 30% of the workforce will be doing this (permanently) by 2021.\u201d</p> <p>France has said its bailout of national carrier Air France will be dependent on the airline <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/air-france-bailout-domestic-flights/\">eliminating short domestic flights</a> where the trip could be made by train.</p> <p>And the enforced end of travel may change expectations around business travel in a positive way, said Prof James Faulconbridge, head of the Department of Organisation, Work and Technology at Lancaster University.</p> <p>\u201cMany of those meetings never needed to happen through travel anyway, but there was a sort of expectation, a working practice that associated travel and going to meet people as a way of doing business, a sign of commitment.\u201d</p> <p>Mass international travel only emerged a couple of decades ago; it is possible that habits could change dramatically again.</p> <p>\u201cIts easy to forget that it was only around the turn of the century that levels of travel we now accept as normal started to emerge,\u201d he said. \u201cSo a reset that changes our presumption around travel is not as radical as it might appear.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<p>I used to be indifferent towards cowboys. I\u2019ve seen a few of the famous westerns, but I didn\u2019t grow up watching them. When lockdown began, however, I started playing Red Dead Redemption 2 on the Xbox for hours every day, and my opinion warmed. Red Dead borrows from all the major films in the genre, and now I\u2019ve finished the game I find myself hungry for more cowboy stuff. Next up is The Magnificent Seven.</p> <p>I know this one contains a famous theme song, which I recognise from parodies and adverts, as well as seven men who are magnificent in an unspecified way. I may have even caught snippets on TV as a kid, but they probably bored me at the time: The Lord of the Rings was always my go-to for horses and violence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5864b66174c6af9e66e1d50b40a4d076410bf789\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5864b66174c6af9e66e1d50b40a4d076410bf789/0_0_1619_2172/745.jpg\" alt=\"A poster for the 1960 film.\" width=\"745\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A poster for the 1960 film.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Grant</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve also heard The Magnificent Seven was inspired by Seven Samurai, another \u201cclassic film\u201d directed by Akira Kurosawa. (I saw this at university, where I briefly studied film.) Seven Samurai follows a group of samurai who are hired to protect a village from bandits. Many regard it to be the pinnacle of cinema, and likewise I thought it was very good.</p> <p>So I\u2019ve retrieved my unopened DVD of The Magnificent Seven. A leaflet inside says that Kurosawa was \u201cso impressed\u201d by the film that he presented the director John Sturges with a ceremonial sword. But according to an interview in 1966, Kurosawa actually thought it was \u201ca disappointment\u201d \u2013 so maybe the sword was more out of politeness.</p> <p>As for me, I thought it was fun! Especially the first act, when Yul Brynner first assembles the Seven and we learn each of their unique character traits: the laidback one, the hotheaded one, the one who wears ties, etc. Brynner is enigmatic and Steve McQueen is cool, but my favourite is James Coburn as the steely Britt, who can outdraw a gunman with a throwing knife.</p> <p>I hadn\u2019t realised that The Magnificent Seven is not only \u201cinspired\u201d by Seven Samurai, it\u2019s a direct remake. The Magnificent Seven lifts the plot of Kurosawa\u2019s film, changes the setting from feudal Japan to Mexico, and swaps the samurai for gunslingers. The story translates well into the old west, although The Magnificent Seven is over an hour shorter, meaning some of the nuance of the original is lost. Much of the interaction between the villagers and their saviours has been cut. The Mexicans don\u2019t say all that much while the mostly white gunmen rescue them, which adds a racial undercurrent that hasn\u2019t aged well.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ffa81154c49af49226b310af8c774ecdc6c59539\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ffa81154c49af49226b310af8c774ecdc6c59539/0_102_2544_1676/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eli Wallach as bandit leader Calvera.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"659\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Absolutely livid \u2026 Eli Wallach as bandit leader Calvera.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Everett Collection/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So yes, in one sense this is a glorified rip-off that guts the thoughtful original, repackages it with a stylish title and fills it with guns. But a fairer comparison for The Magnificent Seven might be A Bug\u2019s Life, the Pixar film where an ant asks some bigger insects to protect his nest from grasshoppers. Again, it\u2019s the same plot, but when I left the cinema in 1998 I don\u2019t remember anyone saying, \u201cThose ants are an insult to Kurosawa.\u201d</p> <p>There are some new additions to the story, such as the bandit leader Calvera, whose role has been expanded. Eli Wallach does \u201cabsolutely livid\u201d very well. The Seven spend a chunk of the middle of the film negotiating with him, which gets dull, but things pick up again at the final battle. There\u2019s a sense of jeopardy here, even if a couple of death scenes felt rushed. I was furious to see Britt throw BARELY ANY KNIVES before he goes.</p> <p>Now for some more westerns. Maybe I\u2019ll try the Magnificent Seven sequels: Return of the Magnificent Seven, Guns of the Magnificent Seven, and The Magnificent Seven Ride! Given that four of the seven are dead by the end of the first film, I\u2019m very interested to know where they take this.</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>Two controversial changes to the jobkeeper program that excluded university workers and entities owned by foreign governments are under challenge in the Senate, where Labor and the Greens hope to overturn the rules limiting eligibility for the $130bn wage subsidy.</p> \n<p>The bids to extend the jobkeeper payment come as Liberal backbenchers debate whether to end the six-month wage subsidy program early and employers and unions unite in warning against cuts.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday the Liberal MP Jason Falinski broke ranks to call for an early end to the payment to encourage employers and employees back to work, and Craig Kelly suggested phasing out the payment for businesses whose revenue recovers in order to help airline catering workers excluded from payments.</p> \n<p>Labor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/11/jobkeeper-payment-could-be-adjusted-scott-morrison-says\">continued to probe the government</a> about casual workers who earn more on the $1,500 fortnightly payment than their usual wages after signalling the windfall could be trimmed back for some workers in return for expanded eligibility.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/11/jobkeeper-payment-when-paid-eligibility-ato-tax-for-sole-traders-start-date-how-long-application-jobseeker-payments\">Jobkeeper payment: check your eligibility and when you should start getting paid</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Labor and the Greens have also decided to attempt to modify the scheme through disallowance motions in the Senate. Both believe they can reverse changes that excluded universities without harming other charities\u2019 ability to access the payment and have given notice to do so. Labor\u2019s Tony Sheldon will also move to disallow the exclusion of foreign-owned entities.</p> \n<p>In a series of changes in April, the Morrison government stipulated that when calculating their revenue to access the jobkeeper payment universities must count their losses over six months, not one month like other employers, and must include commonwealth payments when counting their revenues, unlike other charities.</p> \n<p>Universities were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/04/australian-universities-angry-at-final-twist-of-the-knife-excluding-them-from-jobkeeper\">incensed by the changes</a>, which have left them technically eligible to access the payment but in practice removed all of them from contention.</p> \n<p>The Labor and Greens disallowance motions would help several universities that believed they were eligible before the changes, including La Trobe and Sydney. The parties would need support from four out of five of the remaining crossbench senators: two from Centre Alliance, two One Nation and Jacqui Lambie.</p> \n<p>The Greens education spokeswoman, Mehreen Faruqi, told Guardian Australia: \u201cThrough multiple changes to the rules, universities have been targeted by this government and deliberately excluded from the jobkeeper wage subsidy scheme \u2013 30,000 jobs are on the line, with impacted staff in every corner of the country,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>The shadow education minister, Tanya Plibersek, said Labor had been urging the government to support universities for weeks, but the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, had instead \u201cdeliberately moved the goalposts to ensure universities are excluded from government support\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cSo we will do the right thing and try to fix this in the Senate,\u201d she said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for Guardian

If court was at 8am, he would be there at 6am.\u201d</p> <p>Escobar Mejia worked a wide range of jobs over the years, including in construction and cleaning, Del Valle said, but he ultimately had to have his foot amputated after an accident at work and complications related to diabetes. He continued trying to help around the house and find work, his sister said, even though he could no longer drive.</p> <p>A friend was driving him around on 10 January of this year when the US border patrol stopped them outside of San Diego. He was taken to the Otay Mesa detention center \u201cdue to pending removal proceedings\u201d, Ice said.</p> <p>\u201cIt broke my heart,\u201d Rosa said, recounting his arrest. \u201cHe was very scared that he has to go again before immigration, when he has not done any crime. He was afraid to be killed in El Salvador.

  "<p>There are no silver bullets, clever models or easy answers for how to control the coronavirus. But neither is it rocket science. Governments have three choices in how they respond. The first and most difficult path is to contain the virus through a programme of mass testing, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-app-could-be-ditched-for-different-model-after-trials\">contact tracing</a> and isolating. This requires a huge effort: building a large infrastructure to monitor cases of the virus and identify hotspots, ensuring this system runs efficiently, providing adequate PPE to everyone who needs it, and deploying border controls to vet who is entering the country.</p> <p>The second path is far simpler. It involves slowing the spread of the virus by using timed cycles of lockdown and release, with the government issuing guidance on how much social distancing is required. But the side effects of this path are very costly: it risks wrecking the economy, straining health and social care systems, and creating social unrest. The third and easiest path available to governments is simply to do nothing. The virus sweeps across the population, the economy remains open and whoever makes it through is lucky to still be alive.</p> <p>It\u2019s almost impossible to decipher which path the UK government has chosen. Over the past months, its response has vacillated from the third approach to the second and, more recently, to the first. While <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/11/boris-johnson-coronavirus-roadmap-sow-confusion\">Boris Johnson\u2019s address on 10 May</a> made clear he has recognised the dire position in which the UK finds itself, the government\u2019s confusing new advice \u2013 that people should \u201cstay alert\u201d to the virus, work from home when possible, but go to work if working from home isn\u2019t possible \u2013 exemplified the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/dominic-raab-adds-confusion-over-changes-uk-lockdown-rules\">mixed messages</a> coming from the government.</p> <p>The confusion turns on an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/johnson-address-shows-he-has-been-swayed-by-hawks-in-his-cabinet\">internal struggle</a> between two opposing camps. The first seems to think the government should attempt to get over the worst of the pandemic by allowing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/britain-goes-it-alone-over-coronavirus-we-can-only-hope-the-gamble-pays-off\">the virus to spread through</a> the population, albeit at a slower pace to ease the strain on the NHS, and by creating more hospital and mortuary capacity to cope with a spike in deaths. The second camp wants to drive down the number of coronavirus cases and reduce the rate of infection \u2013 or R \u2013 to as close to zero as possible. It recognises the uniquely dangerous nature of this virus, and the emerging evidence that it can cause <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/5/8/21251899/coronavirus-long-term-effects-symptoms\">long-term health complications in survivors</a> and that immunity may only be temporary.</p> <p>These are clearly two different goals, with two different strategies behind them. The confused messaging from the government is a worrying illustration of the lack of consensus on which of these objectives and strategies should be adopted, both within Westminster and <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-framework-decision-making/\">across the four nations</a>.</p> <p>But this debate misses a more fundamental point: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/22/flattening-curve-new-zealand-coronavirus\">containment (the first path) is the best strategy</a> for public health, the economy and society. The decision in early March to shift from containing to mitigating the virus was disastrous on all three of these fronts. By the time the government introduced a lockdown, the number of coronavirus cases had already increased exponentially, making prolonged quarantine necessary.</p> <p>Now, the key challenge facing the government is to replace this lockdown with a package of public health interventions involving mass testing, surveillance and real-time data to identify clusters of the virus and quarantine those who are infected. This will mean providing adequate PPE to those who need it, enforcing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/09/two-week-coronavirus-quarantine-to-be-announced-for-uk-arrivals\">border controls</a> and instigating a phased relaxation of social-distancing measures. Rather than putting everyone under lockdown, these measures would give health authorities information about the spread of the virus, allowing them to identify hotspots and target interventions where they\u2019re needed.</p> <p>Without these measures in place, the past seven weeks of lockdown will have been completely pointless. As quarantine measures are lifted, the virus will continue to spread, the number of daily cases will rise and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/10/doctors-warn-of-second-coronavirus-wave-as-uk-lockdown-weakens\">second peak</a> will become inevitable. Everyone agrees that we need to get out of the lockdown as soon as possible, but doing so will require massive investment in public health infrastructure. Countries such as South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, New Zealand and Australia have already built this capacity, allowing them to ease measures while retaining control over the virus and identifying who has it, who has had it and who could be exposed to it.</p> <p>The social costs of lockdown are severe. Seven weeks in, we\u2019ve witnessed the increased use of food banks, delayed care for those needing NHS services, the closure of schools, rising cases of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/15/domestic-abuse-killings-more-than-double-amid-covid-19-lockdown\">domestic abuse</a> and bankruptcy among small-business owners. So why has the government made such little progress in building the public health infrastructure necessary to control the virus and ease the lockdown? You could be forgiven for thinking that the lockdown was simply a way to reassure the public that the government was \u201cdoing something\u201d. We need to be asking: what measures has the government put in place to ensure we\u2019re in a better position to release the lockdown and prevent a second wave?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/11/boris-johnson-coronavirus-roadmap-sow-confusion\">Boris Johnson's coronavirus 'roadmap' will only sow confusion | Zoe Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Everyone wants to know when the lockdown will end and life will go back to \u201cnormal\u201d. The better question to ask is how we ease lockdown measures in the coming months and years while preventing a second wave of infections and keeping R well below one.<strong> </strong>There are a number of endings to this story. First, an accessible and affordable vaccine could become available within the next 18 months; second, the government could embark on a resource-intensive and gruelling campaign to eliminate the virus, particularly if emerging data proves coronavirus is as dangerous as diseases such as smallpox and polio; or third, antiviral therapies could become available to treat Covid-19 that make it a mild illness, so the population would gradually and safely build up natural herd immunity. </p> <p>But on our current path we seem destined for a disastrous ending. Lifting lockdown without the public health infrastructure in place to contain the virus will allow Covid-19 to spread through the population unchecked. The result could be a Darwinian culling of the elderly and vulnerable, and an individual gamble for those exposed to the virus. This should be avoided at all costs.</p> <p>\u2022 Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh</p>",

That is, until she realized there was still a way to connect.</p> <p>\u201cWe set up a long table at the end of our driveway with the four ice chests of crawfish,\u201d she said, and each family had just one designated person approach. \u201cEveryone took their crawfish to their front porches and we laughed and yelled around to each other. We also saw some neighbors that we don\u2019t see as often. The crawfish really brought everyone out.\u201d</p> <p>Such interactions mark a surprising shift. A pre-Covid<a href=\"http://cityobservatory.org/less-in-common/\"> report</a> found that only about a fifth of Americans regularly spent time with their neighbors, while a third said they had never interacted with those living next door to them. It\u2019s a steep drop from several decades ago, when a third of Americans spent time with their neighbors twice a week or more.</p> <p>Now even the barter economy is enjoying a boost. Sandra Choute, a special education department chair within the Maryland public school system, found herself making a deal with a neighbor in her complex who works as a nursing assistant and lacked supplies to mend a mask.</p> <p>\u201cShe needed needles and thread,\u201d Choute said. \u201cI made her a small sewing kit and she gave me gloves and masks.\u201d</p> <p>Choute\u2019s relationships with neighbors have gotten deeper, she added. Casual chit-chat from her balcony can easily turn emotional, as it did recently when a neighbor in the grass below explained how an aunt in New York was battling both cancer and Covid at once. \u201cShe\u2019s in tears and I\u2019m just trying to talk to her, trying to lift her spirits,\u201d Choute recalled.</p> <p>It can be easy, while complaining about or praising one\u2019s neighbors, to forget that you are also a neighbor yourself, as Hillary, a communications specialist from Cincinnati, discovered recently.</p> <p>\u201cMy downstairs neighbor is definitely still having hookups,\u201d she said a few weeks ago. \u201cShould I call the police, or \u2026 ?\u201d</p> <p>But when the Guardian circled back a week later, Hillary was in higher spirits. She and a different neighbor from down the hall had started dating.</p> <p>\u201cThe tables have turned,\u201d she said.</p>",

  "<p>For eight hours a day, from March until May, research biologist Will Hawkes surveys huge swarms of insects landing on the Karpaz Peninsula on the north-east corner of Cyprus. \u201cThis place is a migratory hotspot for millions of painted lady butterflies, drone fly hoverflies, seven-spot ladybirds and vagrant emperor dragonflies \u2013 it\u2019s like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen before,\u201d says Hawkes, a PhD student at the University of Exeter\u2019s Genetics of Migration lab who first studied the phenomenon here a year ago.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis island is a pit stop for millions of insects that fly at high altitudes over the sea then come to land to rest as they migrate, possibly thousands of kilometres from the Middle East to western Europe. It\u2019s just astonishing that these creatures migrate such long distances and in such vast numbers in order to find the right food to eat and to reproduce in environments at particular temperatures,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>\u201cOne grass fly we found at Cyprus is just 2mm long, so, for their body size, these migrations are quite incredible. Most of the time they\u2019re completely invisible to us,\u201d adds Hawkes, who explains that the distances travelled by insects flying via Cyprus are as yet unknown. The <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-tropical-ecology/article/do-dragonflies-migrate-across-the-western-indian-ocean/227EEFD644DBD0E5220AF176D6958192\">furthest insect migration recorded</a> is the 18,000km journey of the 4cm-long globe skimmer dragonfly between India and Africa.</p> \n<p>Hawkes\u2019s PhD supervisor, Dr Karl Wotton, describes his research at Karpaz as significant. \u201cMigration hotspots like this are a window into processes that normally go on unseen, high above our heads, as huge amounts of insects make seasonal movements,\u201d says Wotton. \u201cThis Cyprus hotspot shows how distant ecosystems can nevertheless be connected.

By transferring pollen between different populations of plants as they travel, migratory insects help maintain a diverse gene pool for wild plants and crops, increasing resilience to changes in environmental conditions and the effects of climate change.</p> \n<p>Remarkably, insects are multigenerational migrants \u2013 one full circuit involves between three and six generations of adults moving north from springtime to late summer, followed by one generation travelling back south during the autumn migration. The adults die once eggs are laid, before larvae hatch, so these long-distance migrations are not learned behaviours. \u201cThese migrations are purely genetic. Insects use the sun as their compass and <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096098220800362X\">only migrate on days when the winds are favourable</a>,\u201d says Hawkes, who also surveys insects flying along the valleys in the Pyrenees mountains on their autumn migration south. \u201cIt\u2019s also likely that when a huge volume of adults dies at the end of each leg of the journey, their biomass provides a seasonal input of nutrients in each location which could be a key food source for other species.\u201d</p> \n<p>But with plummeting insect populations, conserving biodiversity has never been more crucial. A global review published in the journal Biological Conservation found that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/10/plummeting-insect-numbers-threaten-collapse-of-nature\">more than 40% of insect species</a> are declining and a third are endangered.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3067f14e-e499-4fb2-9302-b5196c99632f\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Insects are crucial to the health of functioning ecosystems that are vital for food production and security. Pollinators like bees get a lot of attention because three quarters of crops producing fruit and seeds for human consumption depend on them, <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/I9527EN/i9527en.PDF\">according to the Food and Agriculture Organization</a>. Other types of insects include herbivores, detritivores, parasitoids and predators that are crucial to ecosystems humans rely on to survive, acting as pest controllers, recycling nutrients and performing other tasks.</p>\n    <p><b>How do humans harm insects?<br></b>Habitat loss and fragmentation, pollution, invasive species, the climate crisis and over-harvesting are all human-caused issues that put pressure on insects, say experts. The heavy use of synthetic pesticides and fertilisers is the primary driver of harm to insects by humans, according to the first <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006320718313636\">global scientific review of the literature in 2019</a>.</p>\n    <p><b>How bad is it?<br></b>Bad. Insect populations around the world are plummeting, with 40% of species declining and a third endangered, according to the same literature review. On average, insect biomass on Earth has fallen 2.5% a year for the last three decades or so, which could mean they vanish within the next 100 years.</p>\n    <p><b>What happens if insects become extinct? </b><br>The survival of mankind would be at stake. With no insects to pollinate the crops humans rely on to eat or perform vital functions in ecosystems, humans would be in trouble.</p>\n    <p><b>What can we do about it?</b><br>Insect experts have devised a roadmap for conservation and recovery. In the short term, humans must phase out pesticide use, prioritise nature-based farming methods and reduce light, noise and water pollution. In the long term, scientists have called for an international body to monitor the health of insect populations and action taken to help them.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cMigratory insects are vulnerable to habitat loss beyond the boundaries of one country, and climate breakdown could affect the migration routes and ranges of these insect species so we need to take a more global, holistic view of conservation,\u201d says Hawkes, who believes farmers can make an enormous difference by reducing the use of pesticides and leaving field margins to grow wild.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy to see the difference in numbers of insect types between a patch of wildflowers at the edge of a field and the middle of a crop \u2013 we need to move away from monoculture towards agro-ecology.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2eae600924fd792015e9feec243a1b12984cef65\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2eae600924fd792015e9feec243a1b12984cef65/0_0_6199_4133/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spraying pesticide\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reducing the use of pesticides by farmers would make a huge difference to biodiversity.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Barritt/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Matt Shardlow, chief executive of invertebrate conservation charity Buglife, warns that spray drift and soil transport of pesticides into field margins pose a risk and that wildflower-rich habitats should be prioritised in urban areas, on road verges and railways, away from crops sprayed with pesticides.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re restoring wildflower grassland to increase the availability of pollen and nectar for dispersing wild insects along a network of insect pathways called B-Lines throughout the British countryside and towns,\u201d says Shardlow, who is keen to persuade the authorities and EU partners to roll the network out across Europe.</p> \n<p>\u201cThese <a href=\"https://www.buglife.org.uk/our-work/b-lines/\">B-Lines</a> will enable better dispersal of migrants and enable more species to start dispersing north again \u2013 something that\u2019s prevented by increasingly fragmented habitats and the polluted nature of intervening land.\u201d</p> \n<p>On an international scale, further research is required before the science of this Cyprus migration hotspot can influence policy and conservation management. \u201cWe need further understanding of the biology of the species involved, natural variation in numbers and the routes taken before any strong recommendations can be made,\u201d Wotton says.</p> \n<p>\u201cConservation of entire migratory tracks takes collaboration between farmers, conservationists and politicians,\u201d Hawkes adds. \u201cWe need to think beyond borders and consider how habitats link together along these migratory routes.</p> \n<p>\u201cAt an international level, we need politicians to realise that insects are playing a vital role so that governments create consistent policies that protect the diversity of insects and the plants they rely on.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Find more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-age-of-extinction\">age of extinction coverage here</a>, and follow biodiversity reporters <a href=\"https://twitter.com/phoeb0?lang=en\">Phoebe Weston</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pgreenfielduk?lang=en\">Patrick Greenfield</a> on Twitter for all the latest news and features</em></p> \n<p><br></p>",

Families with young children have been threatened with arrest, having their boats seized, or being towed out to open water for trying to anchor in sheltered bays, looking for food and water. Thousands have been left with nowhere to go and are undertaking risky passages. People sailing the coasts of Sri Lanka, India, and through the pirate-infested Gulf of Aden to the Horn of Africa, report being forced out to sea by navy gunboats patrolling coastlines. Many have been charged exorbitant prices for life-sustaining supplies as they rapidly run out of cash. Daria Blackwell of the Ocean Cruising Club (OCC) says risky journeys have become common: \u201cOne boat arrived in South Africa, was turned away and had to continue on to St Helena [a journey of more than 1,200 nautical miles] running short of food, fuel and water,\u201d she says. It was headed for the US but, with non-citizens onboard, not guaranteed entry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/01/no-one-comes-the-cruise-ship-crews-cast-adrift-by-coronavirus\">\u2018No one comes': the cruise ship crews cast adrift by coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The only place people can expect to be accepted \u2013 and therefore safe \u2013 is their home country. But that presents a problem of epic proportions. Many sailors are far from wealthy: their home is their boat, they hadn\u2019t planned for a sudden ocean passage, and now have to cross in conditions they wouldn\u2019t otherwise attempt. Lockdown means it has been impossible to source spares or safety gear ahead of the trip, while travel restrictions have meant many can\u2019t get anyone to join as crew. And while most insurance policies stipulate certain crew numbers for the crossing, they also deny storm cover to boats left in hurricane zones.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"02128394bc9df62eed290811b9ac12efb7e16543\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02128394bc9df62eed290811b9ac12efb7e16543/0_0_5313_3542/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bar mascot at the Sint Maarten Yacht Club wears a face mask while it is closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The normally busy Sint Maarten Yacht Club Bar &amp; Restaurant is currently occupied by a lonely mascot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MG Photography/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like many others, Crothers has to choose the least worst option \u2013 face hurricane season or cross alone \u2013 both without cover. Even food provisioning is tricky. In Sint Maarten food shops have only recently reopened. \u201cMy other concern is trying to socially distance while getting supplies for the trip,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m in the age bracket where I can\u2019t afford to get [coronavirus]. Or to get ill in the middle of the Atlantic.\u201d </p> <p>In these difficult circumstances, sailors are turning to one another for support. They are a resourceful breed \u2013 offshore cruising demands it, given the myriad problems that can arise in the middle of the ocean. The OCC has connected more than 150 boats in the west Atlantic heading for Europe: they\u2019re sharing information and offering support on the crossing. This is not an organised flotilla \u2013 boats are leaving from as far afield as Antigua, Jamaica and Mexico to destinations ranging from Russia to the UK, Sweden to Greece. Skippers will make their own decisions on routes and speeds.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If I go over, that\u2019s it. It\u2019s hard enough for an able man to get back on board \u2013 but with one hand?</p> <footer> <cite>Garry Crothers, sailor</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>However they\u2019re jointly tracking journeys, so if problems arise there\u2019s some prospect of help from others within range. In the first groups to leave, two boats with emergency medical workers and one with a surgeon onboard have offered assistance with medical support while at sea; one boat has helped another with water supply.</p> <p>Crothers has signed up to the list. He is an experienced sailor, but hasn\u2019t done a transatlantic alone. The longest single-handed trip he\u2019s done so far is five days. \u201cCorrection,\u201d he says. \u201cAll my trips are single-handed.\u201d After a car crash and years of pain, he had his left arm amputated in 2017. \u201cMy biggest worry is fixing things one-handed,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m pretty good, but it\u2019s difficult without dropping things, and trying to hold on to the boat.\u201d</p> <p>His first heading will be north, a route many are taking towards Bermuda. Once he has reached the high pressure area, he should pick up westerly winds to sail slowly towards the Azores. From there, he\u2019ll head for Northern Ireland, taking more than three weeks. He has to sail conservatively. \u201cBecause if I go over, that\u2019s it. It\u2019s hard enough for an able man to get back on board \u2013 but with one hand?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/atlantic-zip/giv-39025v67Kbg8JJ2F/\" data-alt=\"Crothers' journey home\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/atlantic-zip/giv-39025v67Kbg8JJ2F/\">Crothers' journey home</a> </figure>  <p>The Azores have been a beacon of light in the Atlantic during this crisis. The archipelago, about 800 nautical miles off the coast of Portugal, is of huge strategic importance for boats crossing west to east. Countries along the Atlantic\u2019s eastern shores \u2013 Morocco, Senegal, Spain, Portugal, France \u2013 have been turning away boats looking for shelter. Island nations such as Cape Verde, off the coast of Africa, lack infrastructure and healthcare to deal with Covid-19, so are more understandably off limits. As Blackwell points out, \u201cPeople are so panicked in countries that don\u2019t have adequate healthcare, they will do anything to protect themselves.\u201d But grateful sailors have been reporting that they could anchor in Horta, the Azores\u2019 port, with access to fuel and water. The islands have a long history of welcoming boats on transatlantic passages, and maritime institution Peter Cafe Sport has been taking food, medical supplies and marine parts to anchored boats.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f30de8b2248e6c3967e9f8a48981f5212ca6a1cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f30de8b2248e6c3967e9f8a48981f5212ca6a1cf/0_0_1080_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Men wearing masks and high viz jackets outside Peter Cafe Sport, Azores\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Cafe Sport has been taking food, medical supplies and marine parts to anchored boats.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: petercafesport</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As welcome as this is, lying at anchor doesn\u2019t afford full protection from weather, or the opportunity to rest, make repairs and plan in the middle of exhausting passages. Which is why sailors have been lobbying governments. <a href=\"https://floatmagazin.de/leute/stranded-in-madeira-sailing-corona-crisis/\">Sailor and journalist Ole Sal</a> has formally applied to the regional governments of Madeira and the Azores, and to Portugal, France and Spain, to provide safe havens, arguing that the lack of open ports is \u201cincreasing the risk of loss of life and damage to vessels\u201d. In Lisbon, yachtmaster Veronique Claus has written to Portugal\u2019s president, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, on behalf of 30 international boats. \u201cCertainly for those who are anchored in unsafe and non-sheltered waters, the situation is life-threatening,\u201d she says, noting that two yachts have already been lost after breaking anchors.</p> <p>Crothers will pass near the Azores, but may not stop if restrictions mean he has to stay on anchor; dozens of others, however, including Britons <a href=\"https://ellieandjohn.com/\">Elena and John Nye</a>, are counting on the stopover for fuel and water (their small boat won\u2019t carry enough). The 33-year-olds, \u201crelative newcomers\u201d to sailing, set off from the British Virgin Islands for Norway on their 34ft sailboat, and hope to rest in the Azores before the onward journey. The Caledonian canal \u2013 a shortcut through the north of Scotland \u2013 is now closed, so they face a difficult passage via the Shetland Islands, where gale-force winds and perilous seas are common. They should get some shelter in the Western Isles, as the UK is operating some key ports and marinas for transit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/18/what-four-years-at-sea-taught-me-about-our-relationship-to-the-ocean\">What four years at sea taught me about our relationship to the ocean</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For those heading east towards Spanish and Portuguese coasts, and into the Mediterranean for France, Italy, Greece and elsewhere, it\u2019s a mixed picture.

In Athens, several Greek crews sailed into a port during lockdown, were fined \u20ac5,000 (\u00a34,380) each by the coastguard and branded pirates in the national press.</p> <p>The Nyes are taking comfort from other boats making similar journeys. \u201cIt\u2019s reassuring that there are others in the same daft situation,\u201d John says. \u201cIt feels really good that in case of problems we can find out where the nearest boat is.\u201d</p> <p>Crothers, whose final destination is Derry, Northern Ireland, is more circumspect. He is looking forward to a pint of Guinness, but the journey is long, and the illusion of strength in numbers falls away when you\u2019re crossing the ocean in very different boats, with different speeds and routes. \u201cUltimately,\u201d he says, \u201cyou\u2019re alone out there.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>By the time the schools closed in late March, my GP consulting room in Edinburgh had been emptied of clutter, its surfaces rendered easy to wipe down with disinfectant. It felt as if the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/were-clearing-the-decks-a-gp-on-watching-the-coronavirus-pandemic-unfold\" title=\"\">decks had been cleared</a>. There are almost 4,000 patients at my practice on the south side of the city, close to the university. As the lockdown began, my colleagues and I were spending our time phoning two or three hundred of the frailest, as well as the 30 or so who had been advised by the government to \u201cshield\u201d from the virus until July at least. On the phone we made sure they understood the advice to stay in and that they had arranged food deliveries for the coming weeks. We checked they had a \u201ckey information summary\u201d \u2013 an electronic pr\u00e9cis of their principal medical issues \u2013 available for paramedics, A&amp;E and hospital staff to access should they become unwell.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/25/gp-doctor-edinburgh-coronavirus-pandemic-podcast\">'The past six weeks have been unlike anything I\u2019ve known': a GP on how the pandemic has changed his work \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the first few weeks of the year, the pandemic had been a dreaded but distant anxiety. I had little sense of how severely it would hit us, and how much planning would be enough. The speed of its arrival was startling, and the past six or seven weeks have been unlike anything I\u2019ve known in general practice.</p> <p>Everything about the way we work has been transformed. The number of face-to-face encounters with patients has dropped by 90%. Home visiting is both more time-consuming (because of the requirement for personal protective equipment, or PPE), and perfunctory (to cut contact time). Dread has given way to fatigue, but not to complacency. I\u2019m worried that too few people are being tested, that the test itself is often inaccurate and that our PPE provision is inadequate. The health gap between rich and poor, already wide from a decade of cuts to councils and benefits, is being stretched wider.</p> <p>Now that restrictive lockdown measures are starting to be eased, cases will surely climb. My GP colleagues and I have all seen some patients with Covid-19, but because of the effectiveness of the lockdown, fewer than forecast in those dark days of March. Two of our patients have died of it \u2013 about the same proportion, 1 in 2,000, as have so far died of the virus nationwide.</p> <p>The agility of the NHS in response to the crisis has been impressive. Our practice has four GPs and two nurses; all still travel to and from the clinic every day, and the four receptionists are still fielding and triaging calls. The appointments book is filled as usual, but now with names for the clinicians to phone back, rather than with appointment times for patients to come in.</p> <p>The NHS is notorious for its slow uptake of technology \u2013 I still use fax machines and pagers daily \u2013 but we can now text patients\u2019 phones with a link to open a video call to our aged desktop PCs. There are still clinical problems for which a physical examination is imperative: those I do at the practice if the patient is fit enough to come in, or at their home if they\u2019re not.</p> <p>Either way, I wear a mask, apron and visor, and two pairs of gloves. As aspiring GPs we were taught to value the subtleties of human communication \u2013 to carefully attend to body language, to silences, to the way a patient holds or evades eye contact. In a mask and visor, I feel less like a GP than an old-school surgeon, oblivious and insensitive.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Two \u201cCovid hubs\u201d were set up in Edinburgh just before lockdown came in: one for telephone triage and one for face-to-face assessments. (A third was opened a week or two later, but then closed, because there weren\u2019t enough patients to justify it.) The idea was to keep patients with coronavirus away from their usual GP surgeries, where risk of cross-infecting others was high.</p> <p>I spent the evening of 19 March at the telephone triage hub, when cases were still climbing steeply, with a glued-and-Sellotaped headset, one finger in my uncovered ear, speaking to patient after patient reporting the same pattern of symptoms: a dry irritating cough (as the virus irritates the upper airways), lack of smell (as the nose becomes infected), headache, a tight chest, fever, and a bone-weary, sagging exhaustion. A few complained of nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea, as the virus upset the digestive tract. And fear: everyone was frightened by what they had heard about this virus.</p> <p>The sickest patients were directed to the other Covid hub for a face-to-face assessment, and I began work there the following week. There is an efficient system in place to keep staff and other patients safe: each patient is met at the door by a nurse in mask, gloves and apron, and has their name and date of birth checked. The patients are given a mask and gloves to put on themselves. They are led down a corridor to the assessment room \u2013 a freshly mopped, stripped-out clinical space \u2013 and offered a seat. The doctor waits outside the room, puts on mask, apron gloves and visor, and goes in once the patient is alone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"09217278c12a4c06396e13454f3b8e9b7432cab5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09217278c12a4c06396e13454f3b8e9b7432cab5/0_0_7831_5221/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Edinburgh under lockdown in April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Edinburgh under lockdown in April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My training as a GP emphasised the importance of building empathy and rapport, but on shift in the Covid hub I stay as far from the patient as possible until the moment of actually examining them, even taking their medical history from the far side of the room. I remember seeing a middle-aged man there who had flown in from Italy not long before lockdown. Another who had caught the virus at his mother\u2019s funeral. A builder who\u2019d had a sick workmate on the last site he worked before lockdown. A young mother who thought she\u2019d caught it on the train from London.</p> <p>On shift one Thursday evening, we all stopped at 8pm to listen for the sound of clapping, but the clinic is surrounded by hospital buildings, and the night was silent. \u201cIt makes my toes curl anyway,\u201d said one of my colleagues. \u201cI\u2019ll be glad when it stops.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI like it,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s the one time of the week I get to see all my neighbours.\u201d For me, those Thursday rituals are far more about people cheering one another, than they are about thanking the NHS.</p> <p>Scotland was at an earlier stage in the spread of the disease as lockdown came in; even so, nationwide distancing measures should have come in earlier \u2013 by early April, with the upswing in cases steepening, we could all see that. Making call after call, seeing patient after patient, I thought how we\u2019d been like toddlers on the beach, watching the waves edging ever-closer up the sand, but still squealing with shock when the water rolled over our toes.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>On 3 April, Boris Johnson, at home isolating with coronavirus, posted a video online. He was visibly overbreathing, interrupting his sentences to take brief gasps. Two days later, he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/06/the-strange-lead-up-to-boris-johnsons-admission-to-hospital\" title=\"\">admitted to hospital</a>, and on 6 April he was moved into intensive care. The BBC was publishing flow charts of how the transition of power would work if the prime minister died.</p> <p>The trajectory of his illness was by now familiar: a week or so of flu-like symptoms, and then, between day seven and day nine, just as most patients start to improve, the onset of worsening breathlessness. Covid-19 has been called a \u201cbiphasic\u201d illness, for these two phases \u2013 the first \u201cvirological\u201d, as the body confronts the virus, and the second \u201cimmunological\u201d, as misdirected messages from the immune system thicken the lungs and the lightest, airiest part of the body becomes sodden with fluid.</p> <p>In my part of Lothian, there are usually two cars providing emergency GP home visits at the weekends and in the evenings. A few days after Boris Johnson was admitted to hospital, I was out in Car 2, driving to a visit in the most urgent triage category, which means getting to the patient within one hour. The experience was a fairly typical snapshot of what it\u2019s like to make home visits as a GP right now. On the phone, the patient had said that after a week of flu-like symptoms he was breathless even when lying on his sofa, and had a fever. It was early evening as I drove to his house. Westering sunlight was turning the suburban streets golden and blackbirds were singing in privet hedges. I phoned the patient from the car for directions. His breath came in gasps, his sentences interrupted.</p> <p>\u201cAre you alone?\u201d I asked. Yes. \u201cCan you sit near the door?\u201d Yes. \u201cJust to warn you, I\u2019ll be wearing an apron, mask, visor, gloves. I\u2019ll give you a mask and gloves to wear, too.\u201d OK. \u201cIf you sit near the door, it\u2019s easier for me \u2013 I won\u2019t have to come all through the house to find you.\u201d OK.</p> <p>I ignored the twitching curtains of the neighbours, the kids out on their bikes. Earlier in the shift, leaving another home visit, a patient had asked me, \u201cCan you shout to the neighbours that I <em>don\u2019t</em> have Covid?\u201d Now I stood at the back of the car, opened the boot, and began The Great Faff \u2013 another new protocol to get accustomed to. Thermometer, oxygen sensor, stethoscope, all placed into a clear plastic bag. Apron on, mask on, gloves on. Then a second pair of gloves over the first. The apron flew about in the wind. (Some of my colleagues have been sellotaping the thin flapping plastic to their legs.) Visor on last \u2013 its frame was 3D-printed in green plastic, with clips for attaching a head strap to the back, and a clear acetate shield to the front. On the inside of the forehead band was written Car 2 in permanent marker.</p> <p>At the patient\u2019s front door, which was ajar, I breathed in the smell of stale cigarette smoke. The man was sitting on a stool just inside the door, elbows on his knees, bracing his chest with his arms to better move air in and out of the lungs. He was wearing grey pyjamas that had lost a couple of buttons.</p> <p>\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d He grunted an acknowledgement. \u201cCan you manage on with one of these?\u201d I handed him the mask, but he couldn\u2019t tie the strings of it. Wishing my forearms weren\u2019t bare, I leaned over him, holding my breath, and knotted the ties at the back of his head and neck.</p> <p>I counted his breaths \u2013 fast, at 28 per minute. I put a digital thermometer in his ear and it flashed red with an impressive fever. I put an oxygen sensor over his finger \u2013 by shining light through the skin, it can gauge the oxygen content of the blood. His was worryingly low. His pulse, even sitting down, was galloping along at more than two beats a second.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"55489bde84ecbe841c8006736662ba1a7c51a72e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55489bde84ecbe841c8006736662ba1a7c51a72e/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Inside the Western General hospital in Edinburgh.

This satellite ward was set up for non-Covid patients to halt patient to patient transfer of the virus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cCould you stand up for me?\u201d I asked. We shuffled awkwardly on the small landing in a doleful dance. He turned his back and I lifted his pyjamas to place my stethoscope on his back. The sound of air through his lungs was accompanied by a quiet hissing sound, like sizzling fat. The sound of pneumonia. In his case, pneumonia probably caused by Covid-19.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going outside, then I\u2019ll phone you about what happens next,\u201d I told him. I picked up the clear bag with my stethoscope, oxygen sensor and thermometer, and stepped out, trying to hold central to my awareness and every action that there was virus on the walls, the door handle, my gloves and all my equipment.</p> <p>Out on the doorstep I gulped down the fresh air, then it was back to the rigmarole: topmost layer of gloves off and into a waste bag. Still wearing my underlayer of gloves, I took a chloride wipe and began to clean all the equipment \u2013 stethoscope, oxygen sensor, thermometer \u2013 and placed them into yet another clear plastic bag, ready for the next patient. The wipe went into the waste, then my apron. Next it was the visor\u2019s turn to get cleaned, and afterwards I placed it on the ground to dry. Then undergloves off, mask off, the clinical waste bag tied off and sealed, and back into the car.</p> <p>With the donning and doffing of PPE, and cleaning all the equipment, home visits now take far longer than they used to. I\u2019d be happier wearing a gown in addition to the gloves, mask and visor \u2013 it would better protect my arms, trunk and legs from droplets carrying the virus. But for now, there are no gowns available. A few days earlier, I had looked through the supplies of gloves and masks that had been delivered to my practice from central government stores: the masks were stamped with the name of a Canadian company, manufactured in China, and distributed by another in Germany. My gloves were all manufactured in Malaysia or Vietnam. If we\u2019re to get this equipment to the people who need it in the UK, we need manufacturers here \u2013 and production should have started in January.</p> <p>From the car I dialled the man\u2019s number again. All those years learning about personal consultation styles, and now I was breaking bad news by telephone from a car parked outside. As I waited for him to pick up, I glanced at the car mirror. My forehead was stamped with Car 2 in reverse, transferred in sweat from the visor headband.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s likely that you have coronavirus,\u201d I heard myself say, \u201cand that it\u2019s affecting your lungs, causing pneumonia. That\u2019s why you feel so breathless.\u201d Silence. \u201cI\u2019ll arrange for an ambulance to come and take you to hospital.\u201d</p> <p>I waited. His breathing was audible. \u201cIs there anything you\u2019d like to ask?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow long for?\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>Heading on to see the next patient, I passed the ambulance I\u2019d just called, on its way to collect him. The paramedics both waved, and I waved back \u2013 one, who wasn\u2019t yet wearing his mask, smiled. One of the few consolations of this pandemic is its grim camaraderie, a new fellowship among the fear.</p> <p>Later on I walked along from the GP clinic to the A&amp;E department to see how my patient had fared. One of the nurses called up his x-ray on the screen: the lungs should be light and spongy, the blackness of air clear against the white of the ribs, diaphragm and heart. But an \u201cinfiltrate\u201d had clouded his lungs. Where there should have been a black void, there were speckled galaxies of white.</p> <p>\u201cHow old is he?\u201d the nurse asked me.</p> <p>\u201cMid-50s,\u201d I said. \u201cLike the prime minister.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOverweight?\u201d she asked. I nodded.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re all like that, up in ITU,\u201d she said. \u201cStrange days.\u201d We paused together for a moment in silence in front of the x-ray, before she had to attend to another patient, as did I.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Throughout April, I watched maps online showing the number of cases growing worldwide, with red dots bloomed into wide circles, like spores in a petri dish. Between 1 April and 15 April they doubled from 1 million to 2 million; deaths tripled from 50,000 to 150,000. Epidemiological studies <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52055546\" title=\"\">were published</a> showing that without limitation on its spread, the coronavirus has the potential to cause 30 million deaths, comparable to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/06/worst-case-thinking-prevent-pandemics-coronavirus-existential-risk\" title=\"\">Spanish flu of a century ago</a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the lack of testing in the UK, even among healthcare staff, was becoming alarming. One of my colleagues came down with Covid-19 symptoms on a Friday, couldn\u2019t get tested until Monday, and by Wednesday evening we were still waiting for her result. Five days from symptoms to result, five days of not having a GP working. Five days, as well, of the GP\u2019s husband \u2013 a hospital doctor \u2013 not working, as he, too, had to self-isolate.</p> <p>If doctors or nurses receive a negative result, and feel well enough, they can go straight back to work. But there are doubts about the effectiveness of the test \u2013 even high-quality studies estimate that it\u2019s accurate <a href=\"https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/comparative-accuracy-of-oropharyngeal-and-nasopharyngeal-swabs-for-diagnosis-of-covid-19/\" title=\"\">only about 70% of the time</a>. We\u2019re just hoping that if there\u2019s insufficient virus in our throats and noses to detect, then there\u2019s insufficient to pass it on to others.</p> <p>As hospital cases plateaued in April, the virus began to take hold in nursing homes. There are two nursing homes on my practice\u2019s patch in Edinburgh; one had an outbreak affecting four or five patients, but it was swiftly and professionally contained. None of the residents died of it. The staff reassured me they had sufficient PPE. I began hearing stories of nursing homes that weren\u2019t so lucky \u2013 that had seen every resident infected, and a quarter had died. I also heard of homes that had no protective masks or gloves.</p> <p>At the same time, it was obvious that, in the wider community, lockdown was helping slow transmission. The numbers in ITUs (intensive therapy units) dropped consistently from a peak around 9 April. We GPs were sent a message of praise from the hospital, thanking us for doing so well at keeping people away. But it was becoming harder to field patient frustration at the shutting down of much of what the NHS used to do. No outpatient clinics, no colonoscopies, no sexual health services, no routine x-rays \u2013 so much has been put on pause. Even cancer services have been stripped back to essentials, and many routine lab tests have been cancelled to create capacity for coronavirus testing.</p> <p>It\u2019s clear that though the lockdown has slashed transmission, it is provoking a silent epidemic of despair. Panic attacks, sleeplessness and plunging moods are all difficulties GPs are encountering daily \u2013 tough conversations to have at the best of times, but even tougher on the phone. Within our area of the city, we already know of suicides triggered by bankruptcies and business closures; and of marriages breaking down. Alcohol-induced injuries are up, as are injuries from assaults. Between 23 March and 12 April, there were 16 deaths from domestic violence in the UK \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/15/domestic-abuse-killings-more-than-double-amid-covid-19-lockdown\" title=\"\">more than triple</a> the still-shocking figure from last year. A police officer friend told me that domestic abuse support lines were experiencing a 30-40% increase in traffic. <a href=\"https://www.samaritans.org/\" title=\"\">Samaritans</a> and <a href=\"https://www.childline.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Childline</a>, too, were receiving high volumes of calls. A domestic abuse hotline for NHS workers had been inaugurated \u2013 intended to support both health workers at risk, and to offer advice should they suspect patients of being abused. When I check routine blood tests on my patients, I have been seeing new flares of liver irritation, which suggest rising levels of alcoholism.</p> <p>Many whose mental health was already tenuous before the crisis now feel unmoored, desperate and angry. The inescapable uncertainty that comes with the disease is particularly difficult to live with, and I\u2019m grateful, as a GP, to at least have reliable work. For those whose jobs offered identity and a sense of purpose, being furloughed has been a tragedy exacerbated by forced disconnection from friends and family. Many children, my own included, are missing the structure and social life of school, and every day I hear of more best-laid plans being added to the bonfire of this global crisis.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The UK maintains relatively few critical care beds in comparison with its neighbours. Before this crisis, there were around 40 ITU beds in Lothian for a population of 850,000.. Now that number has been increased to 113. With the new critical beds added, the UK is at roughly the same levels as pre-pandemic Italy and Bulgaria. </p> <p>The peak of Covid-19 bed occupancy in Lothian\u2019s ITUs was on 9 April, when there were 42. Ten days later there were 30, and they stand now at 11. A friend who is an ITU consultant in the Midlands told me that only four in 10 of his patients who are intubated due to Covid-19 survive it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f10a6747074c55fc847d15aaf213f1fa1fa26c1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f10a6747074c55fc847d15aaf213f1fa1fa26c1e/0_0_3500_2223/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A boarded up restaurant in Edinburgh.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"635\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A boarded up restaurant in Edinburgh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Sunday 10 May, Boris Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-lockdown-what-has-boris-johnson-announced\" title=\"\">relaxed some lockdown measures</a> for England, while Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland kept their own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/10/sturgeon-reveals-irritation-over-uk-lockdown-messaging\" title=\"\">stricter measures</a> in place. Johnson encouraged a return to work, but asked people to avoid public transport, and said that driving to work and to places for exercise would be permitted. I asked my ITU friend what he thought of the speech. \u201cNo mention of facemasks in public? Everybody in their cars? I think it\u2019s an experiment at the expense of the English,\u201d he said.</p> <p>On 7 May, the first minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, had extended our lockdown, shortly after recommending the use of \u201ccloth face coverings\u201d on public transport, in shops and in places where physical distancing isn\u2019t possible. On 10 May, she announced that she had \u201casked the UK government not to deploy their \u2018stay alert\u2019 advertising campaign in Scotland\u201d. The message in Scotland, Sturgeon said, was not \u201cstay at home if you can\u201d, but \u201cstay at home full stop\u201d.</p> <p>The lockdown has already had profound social and economic consequences. It\u2019s likely that unemployment is going to soar this summer, and unless robust housing legislation is put in place, so will evictions. On my occasional work at the <a href=\"https://www.edinburghaccesspractice.scot.nhs.uk/\" title=\"\">Access Practice</a>, a GP clinic providing health services for Edinburgh\u2019s homeless population, I\u2019ve seen how they\u2019re preparing for a surge in need.</p> <p>In late March, the Scottish government, public health officials, charities and local authorities came together to mitigate the worst of the pandemic\u2019s effects on homeless people, with an initiative brokered by the charities <a href=\"https://www.streetwork.org.uk/\">Streetwork</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.bethanychristiantrust.com/\">Bethany Trust</a>. By the evening of 24 March, 80 of the city\u2019s rough sleepers had moved into rooms in one of the city\u2019s empty hotels. With homeless shelters closing to minimise the spread of Covid-19, another hotel was opened as a temporary night shelter. Mobile outreach clinics were set up in each hotel, and rapid detox and methadone programmes initiated for those who needed them.</p> <p>I was due at the outreach clinic in one of the hotels last week, but just before attending, I came down with a viral headache. I felt weak, nauseated and feverish, so instead of going to the clinic I went to a test centre, where a knitting needle of a swab was plunged into the depths of my nose.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/were-clearing-the-decks-a-gp-on-watching-the-coronavirus-pandemic-unfold\">'We're clearing the decks': a GP on watching the coronavirus pandemic unfold</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While waiting for the result, I phoned Rankin Barr, the service manager of Streetwork, to arrange a visit to the outreach clinic, and asked him about the effects of the lockdown. \u201cThe people presenting for emergency shelter are not your traditional rough sleepers,\u201d he said. \u201cMany are coming from domestic problems, relationship breakdowns \u2013 with lockdown they can\u2019t stay with family, can\u2019t go to B&amp;Bs.\u201d We spoke of how much had been done so far \u2013 of the rapid setting up of clinics, of food provision, immigration advice and vaccination programmes, and how the city council was even now procuring more emergency accommodation for the emerging social crisis. The calamity of the pandemic has triggered a new attitude and approach to the city\u2019s chronic housing shortage. \u201cThis virus has changed everything, but there\u2019s an opportunity from now to do things differently,\u201d Barr told me. \u201cThe city and public health authorities are completely on board. We just can\u2019t lose all the vital work that\u2019s been done.\u201d</p> <p>My result came through: negative. I felt better, and will be able to visit the outreach clinic later this week. On the phone recently, I asked one of the doctors organising treatment for the homeless, John Budd, how many cases he\u2019d had to deal with. \u201cWe\u2019ve been lucky so far \u2013 unbelievably, there has only been one confirmed case. That\u2019s perhaps symbolic of just how marginalised the homeless are from society. But when it enters this relatively closed community, it will spread like wildfire,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this virus is like Voldemort,\u201d he laughed. \u201cWe know it\u2019s out there, we just don\u2019t know when it\u2019s coming back.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",

Even Cardi B tried on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B_8lGyYAJBt/\">a pink wig</a>.</p> <p>So I had a problem. The <a href=\"https://www.priceline.com.au/l-oreal-paris-colorista-washout-pink-hair-80-ml\">temporary pink dye from L\u2019Oreal Paris </a>that<strong> </strong>I\u2019d<strong> </strong>usually see at my local Priceline and Chemist Warehouse was sold out, and couldn\u2019t be ordered online due to \u2018low/unknown stock\u201d.</p> <p> After several Google searches, I bought a bottle of <a href=\"https://www.muvo.com.au/products/ultra-rose-shampoo\">Ultra Rose Shampoo</a> from the Australian brand Muvo. It promised to temporarily dye my hair a shade of pink. The intensity would depend on how long I left it in. Although it hasn\u2019t sold out, Muvo\u2019s business development manager, Christa Silvia, says it has sold more over the past few weeks but has also increased its marketing.</p> <p>Several hairdressers confirm they\u2019ve seen a surge in clients dyeing their hair bright shades of blue, pink and purple while stuck in home isolation.</p> <p> Unnatural hair colours might seem like a youthful folly, but Blake James, owner of salon Mr Burrows in Sydney, says lockdown is the first chance many of his older clients have had to try something new. At home they aren\u2019t bucking their workplaces\u2019 strict dress codes.</p> <p>The forced period at home has also given first-time dyers the chance to \u201cget confident with the change themselves, before having to be confident with it in front of other people\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BwRJVVwgoIT/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

If we weren\u2019t going into the lockdown, I would have wavered a lot longer \u2026 it was a catalyst for me. If it fails, I will potentially have the next few months to hide it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2cce4bb126a1d59c3cfcdb471b873c8fe6e971f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2cce4bb126a1d59c3cfcdb471b873c8fe6e971f0/0_140_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Sun, who put bright green streaks into his hair in lockdown, shows off his new colour over video chat.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Sun, who put bright green streaks into his hair in lockdown, shows off his new colour over video chat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justine Landis-Hanley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dr Paula Joyce, a 68-year-old professor of education from Perth, went electric pink around the same time for the opposite reason. She had no intention of hiding it. </p> <p>Worried about how her university students would cope with transitioning to online classes, Joyce thought she would \u201cgive them something just to come in and break the ice\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSo I came into class, they looked at me and said, \u2018Oh my god, what have you done with your hair!?\u2019 It really did achieve its purpose.\u201d</p> <p>Although Joyce says she \u201cnever really wanted to go pink before\u201d, she did have a pink-tinted conditioner in her cupboard. Using it has done more than pique her students\u2019 attention. </p> <p> \u201cIt\u2019s changing me. I tend to be an extreme introvert and quite frankly, I don\u2019t want the lockdown to end,\u201d she laughs. \u201cBut I just think it\u2019s fabulous. I want to dress up and go out for the first time in \u2026 years.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike Joyce, I had been thinking about dyeing my hair since I was 18. Going pink was the reward I dangled in front of myself to get through every law school exam, a metaphorical way of liberating my future self from being an exhausted, regimented student. But I never did it.</p> <p>In popular culture, a major hair change is often precipitated by a major life change (usually a breakup). Blake confirms there\u2019s an element of truth to this. A lot of his clients ask for a dramatic transformation after switching jobs or ending relationships.</p> <p>\u201cI had long hair down to my shoulders,\u201d he confesses. \u201cAnd I just shaved it off three weeks ago \u2026 I have a staff of 17 people. To go from that to nothing within a day, it was soul-destroying. I had a full-on Britney moment, had three bottles of wine, shaved it off, and woke up the next morning thinking what the fuck have I done.\u201d</p> <p>Sitting on the edge of my bathtub, my boyfriend clumsily smearing plum-coloured shampoo through the strands I\u2019d<strong> </strong>missed at the nape of my neck, I wondered the same thing. For the first time in my life my towel-dried hair emerged not blonde but a deep shade of rose.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"48d081a6f9e3b6ec1494e1506656d7d03002270f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48d081a6f9e3b6ec1494e1506656d7d03002270f/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Recycled outfits feel different when paired with pink locks.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Recycled outfits feel different when paired with pink locks.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justine Landis-Hanley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now I\u2019m waking up earlier to style it and I find joy in the moments I catch a lolly-coloured strand out of the corner of my eye.</p> <p>Dyeing my hair wasn\u2019t a way of dealing with change, but a way of compensating for a lack of it. The weeks at home can now be demarcated into before and after. Recycled outfits feel different when paired with pink locks.</p> <p>\u201cJust be careful,\u201d Sun warns me, laughing. \u201cDyeing your hair once is a gateway drug. You\u2019ll probably have lilac hair by July.\u201d</p>",

Those are great developments.</strong> But unfortunately they do not mean that America\u2019s testing regime is on par with other countries. </p> \n  <p>For one thing, the United States is a huge country, with a population about seven times that of South Korea. Many more tests need to be conducted here. It\u2019s also telling that the White House says that less than 10% of tests are positive. Does that mean that a smaller proportion of Americans are positive \u2013 or that the US is testing the wrong people? </p> \n  <p>Unlike South Korea, Vietnam, China and other countries that have had success at containing the virus, the United States has not, in most places, stood up consistent contact tracing for positive cases \u2013 meaning that the country has a blind spot to outbreaks, and that the selection of patients tested is relatively random. </p> \n  <p>As for the death rate in the United States versus Germany and other places \u2013 unfortunately, unlike Germany and other places, the number of confirmed deaths in the United States, a number the US appears to track less carefully than Germany, is still climbing.</p> \n  <p><strong>If you go hunting you don\u2019t brag about how many times you shot \u2013 you brag about how many ducks you bagged. Trump is bragging about shots fired. </strong>And his numbers of tests do not seem to represent numbers of people tested \u2013 repeat tests for certain people, such as health care workers and other people on the front lines (and people in positions of power in Washington) make the per capita number in the United States larger than it is in fact. In fact, most people do not have access to testing through the workplace, and quality daily testing is not in reach for most of America. </p> \n  <p>Finally, unlike other countries, the United States has not paired its testing program with a supported isolation program. That means that outbreaks can accelerate undetected, as health officials mostly are not searching the network of contacts of positive cases, and people in contact with positive cases, who could be asymptomatic carriers, <br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-11T21:01:46.580Z\">at 10.01pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb9bb638f080c72745390cd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-11T20:57:09.092Z\">9.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>For a second time, Trump was asked why the White House staff is able to be tested daily when that is still not available for the American people.

is the center of the outbreak in the US, accounting for nearly a third of all the fatalities in the country. <strong>The report, which comes as allies of the president accuse officials and the media of exaggerating the death toll, strongly suggests that the official total is an underestimate of deaths attributable to the pandemic.</strong></p> \n  <p>Between March 11 and May 2, New York health officials reported 32,107 deaths to the CDC, which is 24,172 more deaths than the seasonal norm. </p> \n  <p>Of these deaths, 13,831 were confirmed by a lab to have been caused by Covid-19 while an additional 5,048 were categorized as probable cases based on the patients\u2019 symptoms and other factors, the report found. <br></p> \n  <p>That leaves an additional 5,293 deaths (or 22% of the total excess deaths) that were not previously identified as confirmed or probably coronavirus cases. </p> \n  <p>The total number of confirmed and probable Covid-19 deaths might not include coronavirus cases in which the person \u201c<strong>did not access diagnostic testing, tested falsely negative, or became infected after testing negative, died outside of a health care setting, or for whom COVID-19 was not suspected by a health care provider as a cause of death,\u201d </strong>the report said. </p> \n  <p>It adds that people with underlying chronic health conditions such as heart disease and diabetes are risk factors for severe cases of Covid-19, and thus their deaths may not have been recognized as resulting from the coronavirus. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div

In Arizona, Trump then one-upped him by touring a factory that was making masks and didn\u2019t wear a mask. He also did so t<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/may/06/trump-live-and-let-die-video\">o the sound of Live and Let Die</a>, thus proving my theory that we are in fact living in the Matrix but it isn\u2019t being controlled by the Wachowskis \u2013 it\u2019s being programmed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/armandoiannucci\">Armando Iannucci</a>.</p> \n  <p>On Flynn. The retired general, remember, was fired as Trump\u2019s national security adviser for lying to Pence about conversations with Russians, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about conversations with Russians (as Trump acknowledged) and co-operated with special counsel Robert Mueller in his investigation of lots of conversations about and with Russians before changing his mind and seeking to withdraw his plea. </p> \n  <p>All that, and last week the justice department said it would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/07/michael-flynn-criminal-case-trump-russia\">drop the case against him</a>, prompting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/10/trump-obama-biggest-political-american-history-russia-michael-flynn\">Trump\u2019s Sunday Twitter tear-up</a>. </p> \n  <p>Pence:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think Gen Michael Flynn is an American patriot.

I always start with <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/may/10/coronavirus-map-of-the-us-latest-cases-state-by-state\">the numbers from Johns Hopkins University</a></strong>:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>US cases: 1,329,631</li> \n   <li>US deaths: 79,523</li> \n   <li>New York cases: 335,395</li> \n   <li>New York deaths: 26,641</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>As always, New York is singled out because it is by far the state worst hit. But others have it bad (New Jersey has more than 9,000 deaths, Massachusetts nearly 5,000, Michigan around 4,500) and many are having it worse, with confirmed cases increasing even as most attempt <strong>some degree of economic reopening</strong>. </p> \n  <p>Oliver Laughland, our southern bureau chief, has been writing and co-ordinating some fine coverage of such efforts. Here\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/mississippi-poorest-us-state-attempts-reopen-economic-strain-of-coronavirus\">his report from Biloxi, Mississippi</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/11/texas-reopen-economy-coronavirus-covid-19\">a story about Texas</a>, co-written with Erum Salam there and Nina Lakhani in New York:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/11/texas-reopen-economy-coronavirus-covid-19\">Texas begins to reopen after Covid-19 quarantine \u2013 but is it safe to do so?</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>Politically, the main story of the weekend was an outbreak of cases in the White House and Donald Trump\u2019s reaction. Aides spread across the shows to counsel calm but the New York Times reported that the president was \u201cspooked\u201d, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/anthony-fauci-self-quarantine-donald-trump\">public health experts including Dr Anthony Fauci</a> went into isolation. </p> \n  <p>He may have been \u2013 he will likely say he wasn\u2019t, or isn\u2019t \u2013 but Trump in part reacted by going on an absolute Twitter tear-up about Russia, Michael Flynn and, most saliently, Barack Obama. Here\u2019s my write-up of what the president would like to call \u201c<strong>Obamagate</strong>\u201d, as he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1259667289252790275\">retweets conspiracy-tinged accounts</a> about his successor\u2019s supposed complicity in \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/10/trump-obama-biggest-political-american-history-russia-michael-flynn\">the biggest political crime in American history</a>\u201d:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/10/trump-obama-biggest-political-american-history-russia-michael-flynn\">Trump charges Obama with 'biggest political crime in American history'</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>One would imagine that somewhere, Obama himself is laughing. And, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/09/obama-leaked-conversation-us-rule-of-law-at-risk-flynn-case-dropped\">he told alumni of his administration on Friday</a> in remarks that may have had something to do with the president\u2019s mood, getting ready to hit the trail (virtually or otherwise) for presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden.</p> \n  <p>More to come, obviously. </p> \n  <p>One other thing now, which is that on Sunday <strong>Lamar Alexander, a Tennessee Republican</strong> who chairs the Senate health committee, expressed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/trump-coronavirus-vaccine-senate-republicans\">strong skepticism about Trump\u2019s predictions for how soon a coronavirus vaccine</a> will be found. Not long after that, it was announced that Alexander himself will be entering self-isolation, after <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1259637869641072640\">a staffer tested positive</a> for Covid-19. </p> \n  <p>So, in fact, in some form, will the <strong>vice-president, Mike Pence</strong>, who aides said tested negative on Sunday after his press secretary Katie Miller, who is married to Trump policy aide Stephen Miller, tested positive.</p> \n  <p>It all means many things, but here\u2019s two. Alexander will chair a key Senate hearing on Tuesday remotely, just as Fauci and fellow doctors Robert Redfield and Stephen Hahn will testify before him remotely. To the symbolically minded, after so many weeks in lockdown, that may seem symbolic of how Washington has never really got a hold on this crisis.</p> \n  <p>Also, Trump\u2019s <strong>scheduled Rose Garden press briefing</strong> on testing today at 4pm may seem more timely than ever.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-11T11:36:56.389Z\">at 12.36pm BST</time></p> \n</div>"
