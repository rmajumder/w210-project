  "<p>There is only one thing as alarming as the steadily rising tally of cases of coronavirus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\" title=\"\">around the world</a>: the low numbers reported in places that it could devastate. They may have less interaction with the worst-hit nations than more developed countries. But it may also be that the countries most at risk are least equipped to monitor its spread. Afghanistan, which has reported 22 cases, has only <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/war-ravaged-afghanistan-battles-threat-coronavirus-200316135224827.html\" title=\"\">one hospital</a> which can diagnose the disease, and Covid-19 is ravaging neighbouring Iran. Syria has insisted it is free of the virus, though its five neighbours have all reported cases; there is suspicion that the regime is <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/syria-insists-it-coronavirus-free-takes-broad-steps-prevent-spread\" title=\"\">suppressing</a> bad news.</p> <p>Coronavirus threatens us all. But poorer countries will suffer more than richer ones. Inevitably people are more susceptible when they are malnourished or already in poor health. Infections spread fast in cramped conditions. Health services which are already failing to meet basic needs will quickly be overwhelmed. \u201cWash your hands\u201d is great advice, but of limited use to the two-fifths of the world\u2019s population who lack access to soap and clean water at home. Unicef says one in six healthcare sites have no functional toilets or hand-washing facilities where patients are treated.</p> <p>The Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 shows how widely outcomes can diverge. Worldwide, between 50 million and 100 million people died. But 13 million to 15 million of those may have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/22/pale-rider-laura-spinney-review\" title=\"\">been in India alone</a>, according to the book Pale Rider by Laura Spinney. People in parts of Asia were 30 times more likely to die than those in parts of Europe. Leadership and quick reactions still make a difference. Mongolia \u2013 where 28% of the population lives below the poverty line and health services are extremely variable \u2013 moved fast to close its border with China and halt all public gatherings, stopping all flights and closing schools not long after. It has reported four cases to date. An <a href=\"https://www.voanews.com/science-health/coronavirus-outbreak/somalia-confirms-first-case-coronavirus\" title=\"\">outbreak in Somalia</a>, struggling to emerge from dictatorship, civil war and terrorism, could be catastrophic. But it appears that the one case detected so far was found because air passengers from coronavirus hotspots have been screened, isolated and tested. It has now suspended all flights.</p> <p>For those already suffering from war and other disasters, the prospect of the worst is almost unthinkable. Refugees crowded into camps are particularly vulnerable, warned Jan Egeland, secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, <a href=\"https://www.nrc.no/news/2020/march/coronavirus/\" title=\"\">adding</a>: \u201cThere will also be carnage when the virus reaches parts of Syria, Yemen and Venezuela, where hospitals have been demolished and health systems have collapsed.\u201d There are, at last, some signs of support, albeit far short of what is needed. The World Health Organization will start testing for the virus in rebel-held Idlib in north-west Syria later this week. The regime and its Russian backers have deliberately and repeatedly targeted health facilities there and around 1 million people are displaced, in many cases living without shelter never mind sanitation.</p> <p>The International Rescue Committee is stepping up its work to provide sanitation and hygiene facilities in Afghanistan and Iran. Bloomberg Philanthropies, the multibillionaire Michael Bloomberg\u2019s charitable foundation, <a href=\"https://www.smartcitiesdive.com/news/bloomberg-philanthropies-40m-global-initiative-coronavirus-africa-local-leaders/574289/\" title=\"\">says</a> it will fund a $40m global initiative to fight the virus\u2019s spread in low- and middle-income countries, especially in Africa. Jack Ma, the Chinese billionaire founder of Alibaba, has announced that he is donating test kits, masks and protective suits for medics to each African country. When the world is threatened, people think first and foremost about their own communities. But the most vulnerable must not be abandoned. </p>",

  "<p>One day, when my daughter was eight, I asked her to help me unload the dishwasher. She moaned, dragged her feet and pleaded for Haribo in exchange for this simple task. I asked her if she knew how lucky she was and told her that, in many homes in Nigeria, girls as young as her were forced to do chores all day, every day. They were not allowed to go to school, or eat at the table, or watch TV. She was amazed. Looking into her face, the horror of what was considered so normal during my childhood really hit me. It was child slavery \u2013 and it continues today. It was for these forgotten girls, trapped in domestic slavery, that I wrote my debut novel, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-girl-with-the-louding-voice-9781529359237.html\" title=\"\">The Girl </a><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-girl-with-the-louding-voice-9781529359237.html\" title=\"\">With the Louding Voice</a>.</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.unicef.org/children_1935.html\" title=\"\">International Labour Organization</a> (ILO), the number of working children under the age of 14 in Nigeria is estimated to be as high as 15 million, but due to the nature of the problem it is almost impossible to land on an accurate number. A large proportion of these children are young girls, who work as \u201chouse girls\u201d: domestic servants who are often underage and forced against their will into this kind of work. Many of them never see their \u201cwages\u201d, as they are paid directly to agents or family members.</p> <p>I was born and raised in Lagos, Nigeria. I lived in a smart, middle-class neighbourhood, in a house that sat in the middle of a row of terraced houses. Our neighbourhood wanted for nothing. Nearby, there was a well-equipped primary and secondary school, a church with stained-glass windows and stunning green surrounds, a supermarket that sold the best vanilla ice-cream I have ever tasted, paved driveways filled with good cars, a local beach where you could buy the best grilled meat. Pretty much all of the families who lived around us employed domestic servants, who in some cases were girls as young as eight.</p> <p>I remember two girls in particular. Mariam, a maid to our neighbour, and Edna, who worked for another neighbour. It was easy to spot a house girl. Many of them had unkempt hair and were dressed in tattered, dirty clothes. They would stand behind a family of well-dressed, well-fed, well-spoken children, their heads bent, silent.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHRR9i0MhmU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IHRR9i0MhmU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Heart-breaking ... the trailer for the documentary House Girls.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Mariam arrived in our neighbourhood one summer when I was 13. She was 11 and small, with a shaved head. When she laughed, which was often, the house would seem to vibrate with her laughter. I had no sister, so I found a sister in Mariam. But Mariam was not like me. While I played and spent the summer visiting amusement parks and hanging out with friends in their palatial homes, she worked every day. I watched as a girl younger than me tirelessly cooked, cleaned and, even though she was not employed by my family, washed my clothes and tended to me. I attended an all-girls boarding school in Lagos, but Mariam did not go to school. She spoke in Yoruba and broken English. She was intelligent and brilliant, and we would play together until the woman who employed her (her \u201cmadam\u201d) would return.</p> <p>Edna was older than Mariam, maybe 19 or 20. Whenever they could, Edna and Mariam would hang out together, stealing moments during a shared chore or on a trip to the local supermarket. When I returned to school at the end of that summer, I remember watching as Mariam stood behind her madam, with tears running down her face.</p> <p>It was the last time I ever saw her. When I came back about six weeks later, Mariam had disappeared. Edna was dead.</p> <p>There were so many rumours about what had happened to them. We heard that Edna had lost her life trying to get rid of a pregnancy. We also heard, many years later, that maybe Edna did not die; maybe she ran away. We also heard that maybe she killed herself. No one knew where Mariam went. It was said that her uncle turned up one day and took her away to work for another family. But there were also whispers that she ran away after Edna died. We heard so many things, but nobody really knows \u2013 and like so many of the underage house girls living and working in Nigeria, Mariam and Edna simply disappeared without a trace. I lost a friend that year, and ever since I have found myself wondering what happened to her, and to Edna.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/07/the-girl-with-the-louding-voice-review\">The Girl With the Louding Voice by Abi Dar\u00e9 review \u2013 a tale to spark change</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Nigeria, many of these house girls have no power, no voice of their own. In their silence, many of them suffered horrific physical and sexual abuse. There have been numerous reports of house girls being routinely raped, starved, beaten and disfigured by the families that employ them. I was haunted by an article about a 13-year-old girl who had been scalded with boiling water by her madam. Not only were her injuries horrific, but in the news story this young girl\u2019s face was blurred out. This was presumably for privacy reasons, but it felt to me almost like a deliberate act to disconnect her from the world, as if to say: here is a nobody, just another statistic to report. This is what fuelled my desire to start writing my novel, the protagonist of which is a 14-year-old house girl called Adunni. I needed to see this girl\u2019s face. I wanted the world to understand the lives of girls like her, and like Mariam and Edna.</p> <p>Domestic slavery is big business. A <a href=\"https://www.ilo.org/global/publications/books/WCMS_575479/lang--en/index.htm\" title=\"\">2017 report</a> by the ILO estimates that slavery generates annual profits of $150bn (\u00a3117bn) worldwide, with $18bn of this coming out of Africa. The employers of these girls argue that they are fuelling the economy, providing a job, feeding a child. Some defend themselves by saying these girls are better off working in homes, rather than on the street.</p> <p>In 2004, the Nigerian government created <a href=\"https://www.naptip.gov.ng/\" title=\"\">Naptip</a>, an anti-trafficking agency set up to tackle trafficking of people across the border. Despite this, and despite the increasing outcry by those Nigerians who are documenting this abuse and sharing on social media, the issue persists. There is a lack of clarity around the minimum age requirement for hiring domestic workers and, as a practice that is deeply ingrained in Nigerian culture, it is often difficult to challenge. In an environment that is steeped in patriarchy, where most of the burden of housework and, in more recent times, financial responsibility falls on the woman, this precipitates the need for the services of a domestic worker.</p> <p>Modern-day slavery is not just a Nigerian problem; it is a global one. In London, a city I have lived and worked in for close to two decades, there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/30/number-of-slavery-victims-in-london-up-tenfold-in-five-years\" title=\"\">a tenfold increase</a> in the number of victims of modern-day slavery between 2013 and 2018. As many as 136,000 people may be living in slavery in the UK, with the Modern Slavery Helpline receiving <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/apr/25/uk-modern-slavery-helpline-receives-over-7000-calls-in-a-year\" title=\"\">more than 7,000 calls</a> in a year. In 2018, an <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/12/1027271\" title=\"\">estimated 40 million</a> people were trapped in slavery globally. Approximately 70% of these are female; children account for about 25% of this number. There is a clear and desperate need to tackle these global issues.</p> <p>In 2019, a Nigerian television production company, Salt &amp; Truth, released a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHRR9i0MhmU\" title=\"\">heart-breaking trailer</a> for an upcoming documentary called House Girls, which highlights the experiences and abuse of house girls in some Nigerian homes. The clip was watched and shared by millions, pushing the conversation to an even wider audience and provoking discussion. This is one thing that gives me hope: the rage of the people who watched the clip, and their recognition that, in Nigeria, this is an issue that needs urgent review and resolution. It is too late for Mariam and Edna, but there are some encouraging signs that the mood in Nigeria is changing, and that girls like them may one day have a voice.</p> <p><em>The Girl </em><em>With the Louding Voice by Abi Dar\u00e9 is published by Sceptre</em><em> (\u00a312.99).

Significant numbers of the Kurds in the SDF were also members of the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG), an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK) that has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for more than 35 years in which as many as 40,000 people have died. The PKK initially called for independence and now demands greater autonomy for Kurds inside&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey\">Turkey</a>.</p>\n    <p>Turkey claims the PKK has continued to wage war on the Turkish state, even as it has assisted in the fight against Isis. The PKK is listed as a terrorist group by Turkey, the US, the UK, Nato and others and this has proved awkward for the US and its allies, who have chosen to downplay the SDF\u2019s links to the PKK, preferring to focus on their shared objective of defeating Isis.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are Turkey\u2019s objectives on its southern border?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Turkey aims firstly to push the SDF away from its border, creating a 20-mile (32km) buffer zone that would have been jointly patrolled by Turkish and US troops until Trump\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/07/us-withdrawal-from-syria-leaves-fate-of-isis-fighters-and-families-in-detention-uncertain\">recent announcement</a>&nbsp;that American soldiers would withdraw from the region.</p>\n    <p>Erdo\u011fan has also said he would seek to relocate more than 1 million Syrian refugees in this \u201csafe zone\u201d, both removing them from his country (where their presence has started to create a backlash) and complicating the demographic mix in what he fears could become an autonomous Kurdish state on his border.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How would a Turkish incursion impact on Isis?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Nearly 11,000 Isis fighters, including almost 2,000 foreigners, and tens of thousands of their wives and children, are being held in detention camps and hastily fortified prisons across north-eastern Syria.</p>\n    <p>SDF leaders have warned they cannot guarantee the security of these prisoners if they are forced to redeploy their forces to the frontlines of a war against Turkey. They also fear Isis could use the chaos of war to mount attacks to free their fighters or reclaim territory.<br></p>\n    <p>On 11 October, it was reported that at least five detained Isis fighters had escaped a prison in the region. Two days later, 750 foreign women affiliated to Isis and their children managed to break out of a secure annex in the Ain Issa camp for displaced people, according to SDF officials.</p>\n    <p>It is unclear which detention sites the SDF still controls and the status of the prisoners inside.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-safi\"><b>Michael Safi</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>That push ended when the EU gave Turkey \u20ac6bn to house the refugees in Turkey.

Generations of journalists heard the story from rickshaw drivers, fixers, tea-sellers. The story was that in the forest in the city limits of Delhi, cut off from the world, lived a prince, a princess and a queen. They were said to be the last of a distinguished Shia Muslim royal line. Before moving to the crumbling forest palace, they had taken up residence in the first-class waiting room of the Delhi railway station. While in exile at the station, they demanded that their lineage be recognised.</p> <p>Ellen Barry, a New York Times journalist, unpicks this wild and at times unsettling story with great care and sensitivity in the three-part series for the Daily, The Jungle Prince of Delhi. It sounds like folklore but by episode three it becomes deeply political. In the end it\u2019s a story of family, homeland, dislocation, trauma and the damage done by Partition.

  "<p>Hashem Abedi was likened to the cartoon character Goofy \u2013 clumsy, a little stupid and someone who got things wrong, \u201cjust like a normal dozy\u201d young person. His speciality was making \u201cvery big spliffs\u201d.</p> <p>It was a similar story for his older brother, Salman. His nickname was Dumbo, after another Disney character.</p> <p>Neither brother had completed their education, nor did they want to, preferring to party with their friends, drinking vodka and smoking weed daily. </p> <p>But during Hashem\u2019s seven-week terrorism trial a more complex and troubling picture emerged of him and his brother, who murdered 22 children and adults in a suicide bombing at a pop concert at Manchester Arena in 2017.</p> <p>The brothers, according to friends and family, slowly but surely drifted towards violent extremist views.</p> <p>The catalyst for the change was their father\u2019s decision to fight in the 2011 Libyan revolution to oust Muammar Gaddafi. For a short time, Ramadan Abedi, a seasoned fighter, was joined by Salman. But the 16-year-old was reportedly injured during the fighting and returned to the UK without his father.</p> <p>For the next five years, the boys were left largely alone at an age when they were potentially vulnerable to falling under other influences without any \u201cstrong paternal guidance\u201d.</p> <p>Relatives say this is when they went off the rails. Their initial associations were with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/may/25/salman-abedi-had-connections-to-gangs-and-terrorists-in-manchester\">small-time criminal gangs</a> fighting against a rival grouping in south Manchester. But soon after, the brothers began associating with well-known and suspected terrorists, and both began to preach to their cousins and friends about being \u201cgood Muslims\u201d.</p> <p>Their uncle Adel Forjani, 49, told the Old Bailey during Hashem\u2019s trial, that he had seen both nephews with the twice-convicted terrorist Abdal Raouf Abdallah in his barber shop. Forjani said his nephews had begun showing signs of radicalisation, changing how they dressed and attending a different mosque, before coming into his shop with Abdallah \u201conce, maybe twice\u201d.</p> <p>Speaking via an interpreter, a concerned Forjani, said he told his own sons he did not want Abdallah in the shop and told them not to \u201cmingle with him\u201d.</p> <p>In May 2016, Abdallah, 26, who was paralysed after being shot while fighting against the Gaddafi regime in the 2011 uprising, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/11/libyan-refugee-guilty-syria-terror-offences-stephen-gray-abdalraouf-abdallah\">jailed for more than five years</a> for trying to help people travel to Syria to join jihadists.</p> <p>Four months before the bombing, Salman and two other men visited Abdallah at HMP Altcourse in Liverpool, and there were subsequent phone calls between the pair.</p> <p>This was not the brothers\u2019 only link with terrorists. Neighbours and acquaintances have talked of the pair\u2019s growing religious intolerance during this time, including an incident when an imam at Didsbury mosque, where their father had worked, gave a sermon criticising Islamic State and was given a \u201clook of hate\u201d by Salman afterwards.</p> <p>Police were investigating the brothers\u2019 links with Raphael Hostey, who was killed in an airstrike in Mosul in May 2016, aged 24. Hostey, from Moss Side, is believed to have sponsored hundreds of terrorist recruits.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/feb/25/small-part-of-manchester-that-has-been-home-to-16-jihadis\">Guardian investigation</a> revealed that 16 convicted or dead terrorists had emerged from the same 2.5 sq miles in south Manchester where the Abedi brothers lived. It is understood they were part of a radical network and some prayed at the same mosque, including the Muslim convert and former RAF gunner Stephen Gray, Raymond Matimba and Ronald Fiddler, also known as Jamal al-Harith.</p> <p>While Salman was still a teenager, friends rang a police counter-terrorism hotline expressing concerns about his behaviour. On at least four other occasions, community leaders and members of his family were reported to have warned of his dangerous tendencies.</p> <p>During Hashem\u2019s trial it emerged that they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/05/manchester-arena-bomber-brother-hashem-abedi-thwarted-in-efforts-to-buy-bomb-ingredients-by-friends-father\">allegedly duped unsuspecting friends</a> and relatives to buy the components for their bomb. Many of these cousins and acquaintances <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/10/man-accused-of-aiding-manchester-arena-bomber-deceived-cousins\">were arrested </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/10/man-accused-of-aiding-manchester-arena-bomber-deceived-cousins\">after the bombing</a> but were released without charge.</p> <p>A public inquiry in June will seek to establish whether any opportunities were missed with the Abedi brothers.</p> <p>On the night of the bombing, Detective Chief Superintendent Simon Barraclough made a promise to bring justice, not just for the victims, but to prevent more bloodshed. As Abedi, was convicted, the officer said the case remained \u201copen\u201d in case further information about more plotters emerged.</p>",
  "<p>A military tribunal in Beirut has ordered the release of an American citizen accused of running a southern Lebanese prison notorious for torture during Israel\u2019s occupation of the region.</p> <p>Amer Fakhoury was a member of the South Lebanon Army, a militia group that collaborated with the Israeli army during its 18-year occupation of southern Lebanon starting in 1982.</p> <p>Lebanese authorities have accused Fakhoury, 57, of running Khiam detention centre, a prison where thousands of dissidents and militants were tortured during the 1980s and 1990s, earning him the nickname \u201cthe butcher of Khiam\u201d.</p> <p>He fled to Israel shortly before its forces withdrew from southern Lebanon in 2000 after years of conflict with the Shia militia Hezbollah. After nine months he migrated to the US and tried to claim political asylum but was turned down. Fakhoury became a US citizen through one of his children last year.</p> <p>The court on Monday said he should be freed because the 10-year statute of limitations for his alleged offences had passed. Another charge against him, of having contact with Israel, had been dropped by the military court in 2018 as part of a wider amnesty for Lebanese who collaborated with the Jewish state during the occupation.</p> <p>Fakhoury, who has four children and owns a restaurant in the US state of New Hampshire, has not been attending interrogation sessions since he was hospitalised a few months ago with with stage 4 lymphoma.</p> <p>It was not clear if he would immediately be set free, as another case filed by former Khiam prisoners accusing him of torture is still pending.</p> <p>A US senator from New Hampshire, Jeanne Shaheen, and other officials have called for sanctions to be imposed on Lebanon to pressure Beirut to release him.</p> <p>Former Khiam prisoners have protested outside court during some of Fakhoury\u2019s appearances, including several who alleged they were tortured on his orders. \u201c[The jailers] used to whip our bodies with electrical cables until our skin got lacerated.

The night before he went to collect it, the pro-Hezbollah Lebanese newspaper published a report revealing he had recently re-entered the country and listed the accusations against him.</p> <p>He went to the Lebanese general security headquarters to pick up his passport and \u201cthat was the last time we saw him\u201d, his daughter said.</p> <p>Though Lebanon\u2019s civil war ended three decades ago, many of the leading players remain in key political positions and the country\u2019s politics is still formally divided along religious and sectarian lines.</p>",

There is no evidence whatsoever that somehow the political changes nearly two generations later, in 1989, had any effect upon that legal reality as it existed in and after 1949.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The judges summarised the petitioner\u2019s argument as a claim that Frydenberg had a \u201cshell\u201d citizenship passed to him at birth \u201ccapable of revivification into full Hungarian citizenship by the political transformation of Hungary with the end of Communist rule\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Nice try, they said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If we may say so, the argument as to the revivification of a \u201cshell\u201d of citizenship is an imaginative one, displaying a creative fineness of distinction, which may be, or may have been, seen as appropriate in some legal contexts. Such an approach is inappropriate here.

Even if Covid-19 just went on its irksome way as a granny-killing hyperflu, we\u2019d have to take extreme measures. Each scenario is possible, and the evidence suggests a couple of them are likely.

The German MEP with Scottish roots even puts milk in his tea and says he would rather have a slice of British white bread than traditional German <em>schwarzbrot.</em></p> \n<p>Appointed the chair of the European parliament\u2019s EU-UK coordination committee in January, McAllister will steer 705 MEPs through the upcoming talks on the future relationship. EU and UK negotiators are examining whether they can talk via video link, after face-to-face meetings in London due to start on Wednesday were abandoned because of coronavirus.</p> \n<p>The Brexit job comes after a meteoric rise in German politics, when he became the youngest leader of a German region, as minister-president of Lower Saxony from 2010 to 2013. Long seen as a favourite of Angela Merkel, McAllister was elected to the European parliament in 2014, where he soon landed one of the biggest MEP jobs: chair of the foreign affairs committee.</p> \n<p>The role, which he retains, involves having to deal with one of the EU\u2019s most tricky foreign policy problems: reconstructing relations with a former member state after a painful, three-and-half year divorce.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/12/uk-and-eu-agree-to-dial-down-rhetoric-in-brexit-talks\">UK and EU agree to 'dial down rhetoric' in Brexit talks</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cBrexit is a very sad event and I will always be of the opinion that the UK is in a better position as a member state of the European Union, but I am not sad to do this job,\u201d he told the Guardian.</p> \n<p>\u201cI want us to have the best possible relationship with the UK, and the European parliament will play an important role in shaping our future relations.

The MEP, who got married in a kilt and enjoys drinking sugar-free Irn-Bru, would only say that Scottish independence was \u201can inner British issue\u201d for Edinburgh and London.</p> \n<p>He also advises the 447 million-consumer trading bloc to tread carefully when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/13/brexit-eu-demands-uk-negotiations-draft-treaty\">negotiating</a> with its smaller neighbour: \u201cThe EU always is well-advised to treat negotiating partners with respect no matter which size they are.\u201d</p> \n<p>He rejects simple labels for the deal, whether Canada-plus or EU- , saying the future agreement will be unprecedented in its depth and breadth. \u201cWhat we need is a unique agreement with the UK, but there is no country which will match 100% the demands of the British. So what we are going for is a cooperation agreement, which will of course have an important part on trade, but it\u2019s more than trade. There are many other issues.\u201d</p> \n<p>Last month, the European parliament endorsed a resolution, drafted by his committee, calling on EU negotiators to keep the UK in line with the bloc\u2019s standards on environment, workers\u2019 rights and industrial state subsidies, in exchange for maintaining free trade in goods. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/06/key-mep-group-to-demand-level-playing-field-with-uk-in-return-for-free-trade\">The MEPs approved the maximalist position of \u201cdynamic alignment\u201d</a>, meaning the UK would have to match the EU\u2019s rising standards in these areas. However, other parts of the text suggested the parliament could accept a less demanding agreement not to retreat from existing standards (non-regression). The ambiguity is a sign of a compromise text stitched together to meet the expectations of MEPs spanning conservative right to radical left.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"532df0a3-11ca-4d4e-8f76-d04fd6d181ce\" data-atom-type=\"timeline\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Timeline\">\n    <p><i>(January 31, 1961)</i>&nbsp;<strong> Brefusal</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain\u2019s entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a \u201cdeep-seated hostility\u201d towards the European project.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(January 31, 1973)</i>&nbsp;<strong> Brentry</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>With Sir Edward Heath having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/29/the-highs-and-lows-of-britains-47-years-in-the-eec-and-eu\">signed the accession treaty</a> the previous year, the UK enters the EEC in an official ceremony complete with a torch-lit rally, dickie-bowed officials and a procession of political leaders, including former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(January 31, 1975)</i>&nbsp;<strong> Referendum</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The UK decides to stay in the common market after 67% voted \"yes\".

  "<p>Last Tuesday morning at Middlebury College in Vermont, rumors swirled. Across North America, colleges and universities were suspending in-person classes and shuttering campuses in response to the coronavirus outbreak. An associate professor had sent an email to students in two of his classes, indicating that Middlebury classes would end that Friday, 13 March, and screenshots of the email began to spread through an increasingly anxious student body of more than 2,500 undergraduates.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone was like, \u2018Is this real? What do I do? How do I prepare?\u2019\u201d said Leif Taranta, a Middlebury student. \u201cDo we need to leave this place that\u2019s been our home?\u201d</p> <p>About an hour later, Middlebury\u2019s president, Laurie Patton, confirmed that students would have to leave campus by Friday for an extended two-week spring break. Remote classes would begin on 30 March, and students would be \u201cexpected to remain at home and not return to campus until further notice\u201d.</p> <p>Immediately, concerns abounded. How quickly could they find storage space for all their belongings, or arrange travel plans to go home? A number of students could afford to purchase plane tickets home with only a few days\u2019 notice, but many could not. The announcement stipulated a process for students to request permission to remain on campus, especially if they were international students, but how exactly would that work? Would anyone end up homeless?</p> <p>In the midst of this panic, Taranta and a number of other students created a publicly editable Google spreadsheet. \u201cPlease list anything you can offer the community under the offers sections, and any requests you have in the requests column,\u201d they wrote.</p> <p>The Middlebury Mutual Aid Spreadsheet circulated through social media, and within 24 hours, it was filled with responses from students, faculty, staff, alumni and community members from the surrounding town of Middlebury.</p> <p>They offered each other rides to the airport in Burlington, or the Amtrak station in Port Henry. They arranged carpools to Boston, New York City, Philadelphia. Mike Roy, the dean of library and information services, volunteered his barn for storage space. They listed their spare rooms, air mattresses, couches and futons. They offered up food, healthcare supplies and emotional support.</p> <p>\u201cI have a car and as of now am staying on campus, so if you need help transporting things to storage or a ride to the airport let me know!\u201d wrote one student.</p> <p>\u201cMy wife, Pat, and I are healthy seventysomethings living in Middlebury,\u201d wrote a local resident. \u201cWe have two bedrooms available in our home and are able to provide transportation support as necessary.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs it your birthday while stuck on campus?\u201d wrote Stacie Marshall, a staff member. \u201cI will bake you a (mini) cake!\u201d</p> <p>Middlebury College itself eventually began to offer more resources, like financial assistance for low-income students\u2019 travel arrangements. \u201cInstitutions can\u2019t move fast enough to respond right away,\u201d said Taranta. \u201cThey\u2019re large and slow and bureaucratic. In the first couple of days, it was just student organizers and community relationships that stepped up.\u201d</p> <p>As schools continue to close, some have followed the same model of mutual aid, including Wesleyan College and Tufts University. </p> <p>By now, most students have returned to their homes. For Taranta and others, however, the mutual aid effort has only just begun.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Having received all this amazing support, there\u2019s this desire to give back to the communities that helped us</p> <footer> <cite>Leif Taranta</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cStudents have been vulnerable as they face these surprise evictions,\u201d said Taranta. \u201cBut there\u2019s also this reality that we are the least at-risk in terms of the actual virus, unless we\u2019re immunocompromised. So having received all this amazing support, there\u2019s this desire to give back to the communities that helped us. What can young people do that might be dangerous for older people to do?\u201d</p> <p>As the coronavirus continues to spread, policymakers and medical professionals have exhorted the public to practice social distancing \u2013 remove themselves as potential vectors for Covid-19 by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/16/how-to-social-distance-convince-friends-family\">limiting their interactions with others</a>. This is the premise: for the sake of protecting those vulnerable, the elderly and the immunocompromised, everyone must sacrifice. Cancel your dates and your dinner parties, your weddings and your funerals. Remain indoors, mitigate the pandemic.</p> <p>But many people are ready to contribute even more.</p> <p>Walela Nehanda is a community organizer and poet based in South Los Angeles. Nehanda has advanced stage leukemia, and regularly uses a particular Lysol spray to disinfect surfaces. When panic-buying emptied store shelves, Nehanda\u2019s partner spent days searching for the spray.</p> <p>\u201cIt was sold out everywhere in Los Angeles,\u201d said Nehanda.</p> <p>Nehanda, who uses they/them pronouns, has been using social media to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/itswalela/status/1235627352186478592\">find a match</a> for a bone marrow transplant. When they feared they wouldn\u2019t be able to find disinfectant spray, they turned to Twitter.</p> <p>\u201cWithin 10 minutes,\u201d they said, two people volunteered to send them Lysol. \u201cEven after I said my needs were met, people were still offering to help me.\u201d</p> <p>Realizing that others might be in similar situations, Nehanda started a Twitter <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u6JQDlkjEWaYtfTxQ54gshOjOl9Fc76UCi5jVYYGn9E/edit#\">thread</a> where immunocompromised people listed what they needed, and people with access to disinfectant products volunteered to send them out.</p> <p>\u201cThe response has been overwhelmingly positive,\u201d said Nehanda, who eventually created a Google document to organize it all. Nearly 200 people from across the US and Canada signed up to mail out soap, face masks and hand sanitizer. Even more offered to make local food deliveries and run errands.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m really proud of how self-motivated some people are to really ensure everyone is OK, and be committed to practicing mutual aid in real life in their own communities,\u201d said Nehanda.</p> <p>Mutual aid is a concept in organization theory, based on the late-19th-century anarchist writings of Russian economist and sociologist Peter Kropotkin. It describes people providing each other support, whether through resources or services, for the sake of mutual benefit. The hallmark of mutual aid is that aid flows horizontally \u2013 between peers, colleagues, community members \u2013 rather than from the top-down, as it would from a government, major charity or other institutional program to those in need.</p> <p>It is fitting that mutual aid is rooted in anarchist theory: typically, in times of crisis, war, or natural disaster, when institutions begin to fail, human altruism comes to the forefront.</p> <p>After the 2017 Mexico City earthquake, civilians organized brigades to move broken pieces of rubble, and volunteers directed traffic. In 2011, in the aftermath of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident, a group of 200 Japanese elderly volunteered themselves to work to stabilize the nuclear plant, citing their likelihood to die of other causes before cancer from radiation exposure.</p> <p>Even in the US, a nation characterized by individualism, disasters have had a tendency to beget altruism. John Abruzzo, a quadriplegic accountant, was working in the World Trade Center during the September 11, 2001 attacks. His co-workers took turns carrying him to safety down 69 flights of stairs.</p> <p>For some populations, of course, the disaster is constant. For many marginalized and vulnerable demographics, crisis only exacerbates already-dire circumstances.</p> <p>As the threat of Covid-19 looms, many sex workers have seen drastic decreases in business.</p> <p>\u201cAny time the demand for services is really low, and people are pushed into a place of financial desperation, some clients will take advantage of that,\u201d said Molly Simmons, a sex worker and activist based in Brooklyn. \u201cThey\u2019ll ask people to cross boundaries they\u2019re not comfortable with, perform services in unsafe areas, lower their prices. So people find themselves taking more risks because work is scarce.\u201d</p> <p>To compound the problem, sex workers are often unable to access social services. Sex work is largely a cash industry, and workers often struggle to open bank accounts or obtain health insurance. Some have criminal records. Some are migrant workers without documentation. They generally do not have paid sick leave.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a paystub to show anyone,\u201d said Fera Lorde, another Brooklyn-based sex worker and activist. \u201cI can\u2019t prove to a bureaucracy that I\u2019m poor.\u201d</p> <p>Simmons and Lorde are representatives at the Brooklyn chapter of the Sex Worker Outreach Project, a social justice network dedicated to the rights of sex workers. To support their community, they started a <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/z6w8v5\">GoFundMe</a> to raise an emergency relief fund for sex workers in New York.</p> <p>Many of the donors are other sex workers.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re always spreading the wealth around,\u201d said Lorde. \u201cWhenever we\u2019re flush, we help each other out.\u201d</p> <p>For Taranta, mutual aid is the path forward \u2013 not just for this crisis, but for the next one.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re about to face all these collapses,\u201d said Taranta. \u201cWith the economy, and with climate change. We need to have these systems ready.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s hard to know what to do at a time like this. It feels like so many of us are falling into a deep sense of despair as we\u2019re bombarded with apocalyptic news on our social media feeds and on the radio. The UK was already ill equipped for a crisis like this \u2013 a decade of austerity left us with a cash-strapped and understaffed health service, and a shaky economy built on precarious work. Now, with the number of new cases of coronavirus increasing rapidly, alongside the confusion brought on by the government\u2019s response, it\u2019s starting to feel as if we must also take community action to look after each other.</p> <p>That\u2019s why a handful of community organisers and activists have set up a <a href=\"https://covidmutualaid.org/\">nationwide network of Mutual Aid groups</a>, which are providing resources and connecting people to willing volunteers and those in need. In this time of uncertainty, we\u2019re coming together to lend each other a hand. While many are practising \u201csocial isolation\u201d, the 300+ groups that have sprung up in the past week are showing it\u2019s possible, and indeed necessary, for us to connect and communicate with our neighbourhoods in response to the outbreak.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/14/coronavirus-outbreak-inequality-austerity-pandemic\">We're about to learn a terrible lesson from coronavirus: inequality kills | Owen Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is a global crisis, with terrible, widespread consequences that are still unfolding. But, in many ways, it calls for local responses. No matter what we look like, where we live, or how much money we have, getting sick reminds us that we are all human and our bodies are fragile. Simultaneously, in every community it\u2019s still the old, the sick and those who are most structurally disadvantaged that will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/14/coronavirus-outbreak-inequality-austerity-pandemic\">be most affected</a>.</p> <p>The thousands of people who have signed up to our network, who are self-organising on Facebook and WhatsApp, have been out on the streets handing out leaflets that detail the kind of help we can give to those who need it. We\u2019re offering to deliver to people in self-isolation the basic things they need \u2013 from prescriptions to the weekly food shop. We\u2019re also offering a chat on the phone to the many, many people who are feeling more isolated than ever, as the walls of their homes become the temporary borders of their lives. With thousands of people already self-isolating, and those over 70 being told <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/coronavirus-uk-over-70s-to-be-asked-to-self-isolate-within-weeks-hancock-says\">to stay indoors within weeks</a>, it\u2019s crucial we make these connections now.</p> <p>Through our networks, some amazing actions have already taken place. From packed lunches being delivered to isolated families in North Tyneside to the topping up of food bank provisions in Hackney, east London, these first few days have seen a flurry of urgent and important activity.</p> <p>While we want to highlight the importance of community organising, local action alone isn\u2019t enough. The truth is that we are trying to plug gaps left by the government, which is why we\u2019re calling on it to match the community spirit and solidarity of our network by quickly pushing ahead with measures such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/coronavirus-hancock-urged-to-guarantee-sick-pay-for-social-care-workers\">guaranteed sick pay</a> for all, expanding free wifi to those without an internet connection, support for renters and the release of immigration detainees. In conjunction with local work, these government decisions would protect people at the sharpest end of inequality in the UK.</p> <p>These are going to be some of the hardest weeks this country has faced in many years \u2013 a time of strain when some will undoubtedly try to turn our communities against each other. Our network is an explicit rejection of that kind of division \u2013 a sign that solidarity between people won\u2019t be broken, no matter how harsh the conditions we find ourselves in. Our hope is that by the end of this challenging period we will have fostered lasting connections within our communities \u2013 that begin to overturn the deep separation and inequity that is so prevalent in our country.</p> <p>\u2022 Farzana Khan is a writer and community organiser, and a founding director of <a href=\"http://healingjusticeldn.org/\">Healing Justice London</a></p>",

You\u2019ll be sick of hearing about them by the time we reach November\u2019s election. But the primaries tomorrow are going to be a key test of the candidates\u2019 appeal to the Latino population. </p> <p>Jonathan Cooper at the Associated Press has been looking at how this is a real chance for Joe Biden. He\u2019s run repeatedly into a wall in western states, reports Cooper, where Bernie Sanders\u2019 strength among Latinos propelled his campaign even as he struggled with other groups.</p> <p>Arizona and Florida offer Biden a chance to show he can make up ground with Latinos, a crucial group of voters he\u2019ll need in his corner to defeat Trump. Sanders\u2019 strength with them helped him to an overwhelming victory in the Nevada caucuses and contributed to his Super Tuesday wins in California and Colorado.<br></p> <p>Biden is playing catch-up when it comes to engaging Latino voters and is weighed down by anger over the high rate of deportations during the Obama administration, which left scars for many immigrants and their families.</p> <p>\u201cWe need more. And we need commitments as we move into the general,\u201d said Regina Romero, a Democrat who recently took office as Tucson\u2019s first Latina mayor. Biden can win over reluctant Latinos with a bold and progressive stance on immigration, she said.<br></p> <p>\u201cI hope that he doesn\u2019t eat up the lie that he has to be more conservative on the immigration issue,\u201d said Romero, who hasn\u2019t endorsed Biden or Sanders since her favoured candidate, Elizabeth Warren, dropped out. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be afraid of an issue that is so important for Latino voters, water it down and not have policies that Latinos can get excited about.\u201d</p> <p>Arizona and Florida are both likely to be battlegrounds in the November election. In Arizona, one in three residents is Latino; in Florida, it\u2019s one in four.</p> <p>Early in his administration, Obama aggressively increased efforts to deport immigrants living in the country illegally. He\u2019d hoped to convince members of Congress and the public that he was serious about border security in order to secure a comprehensive immigration reform bill that would extend legal status to millions of people living in the US without authorization. The reform bill never passed, but the deportations disrupted families, drove fear in immigrant communities and left deep wounds.<br></p> <p>Any Democrat\u2019s immigration policies would be superior to Trump\u2019s, but that won\u2019t be enough to excite Latinos, said Tomas Robles, co-director of Living United for Change in Arizona, or LUCHA, a Latino organizing group that has endorsed Sanders.</p> <p>\u201cYou cannot depend on people\u2019s hatred or fear of Trump to inspire them to turn out in droves for Vice President Biden,\u201d Robles said to the AP. \u201cBernie has worked hard to motivate Latinos as a base. But the entire establishment part has failed at doing the same.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6f70828f088d7575594308\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-16T12:32:10.952Z\">12.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US calls on Vietnam to release blogger Truong Duy Nhat</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The State department have issued <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/sentencing-of-blogger-and-radio-free-asia-contributor-truong-duy-nhat/\">a statement calling for the release of Truong Duy Nhat</a>, a weekly blogger for the Vietnamese service of Radio Free Asia. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/05/truong-duy-nhat-vietnam-blogger-radio-free-asia-thailand\">He disappeared in January 2019</a>, a day after he applied for refugee status with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Bangkok, and reappeared in custody.</p> <p>Truong Duy Nhat was sentenced to a 10-year prison term last week.

But I think it\u2019s important to realise the scale of UK testing which has been substantial. Over 44,000 tests conducted, of which over 42,000 were negative, and we will continue to scale up the testing every single week from here in moving out into the wider community. </p> \n   <p>The test we have at the moment only tests for people who\u2019ve currently got disease. The thing which will be transformational would be a test to reliably tell us if someone has previously had disease, so we can pick up and find out what proportion of people get this infection without any symptoms.

Good luck with that.</p> \n   <p>No one knows for sure how to predict the unprecedented \u2013 or how to handle it. Initially there was a sense, certainly among the doctors to whom I have spoken,that Britain\u2019s position at the non-hysterical end of the spectrum was correct. The chief medical officer for England, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/08/five-coronavirus-experts-guide-british-public-through-crisis\">Chris Whitty</a>, took the view that the illness, though highly contagious, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/uk-government-coronavirus-plans-strip-fire-and-police-to-essentials-covid-19\">most dangerous</a> for those with a vulnerable immune system. The death rate was almost exclusive to this mostly elderly group. There was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/uk-covid-19-strategy-questions-unanswered-coronavirus-outbreak\">no immediate reason</a> to upheave hospitals, close schools, ban social activities or plunge the economy into recession. There were reasons only for contingencies.</p> \n   <p>As the virus expanded and other governments reacted differently, this stance was challenged. But Whitty had accepted that, if circumstances altered, policy would shift from \u201ccontain to delay\u201d. This was undermined as global hysteria rose to a peak. Other countries were reacting as had China and South Korea, and progressed to \u201clockdown\u201d. England\u2019s chief scientific officer, Sir Patrick Vallance, unwisely mentioned the technical term \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-science-chief-defends-uk-measures-criticism-herd-immunity\">herd immunity</a>\u201d, implying that Britain would over time develop resistance to coronavirus.

overall death toll from the virus currently sweeping the world.</p> \n   <p>Emissions from petrol and diesel engines were still at \u201cdangerous\u201d levels that could imperil the most vulnerable during this and future pandemics, said the European Respiratory Society (EPS), which is a member of the EPHA.</p> \n   <p>\u201cPatients with chronic lung and heart conditions caused or worsened by long-term exposure to air pollution are less able to fight off lung infections and more likely to die,\u201d EPS member Sara De Matteis said.</p> \n   <p>\u201cThis is likely also the case for Covid-19,\u201d added de Matteis, who is also an associate professor in occupational and environmental medicine at Italy\u2019s Cagliari University.</p> \n   <p>While there is currently no proven link between Covid-19 mortality and air pollution, one peer-reviewed study into the 2003 SARS outbreak showed that patients in regions with moderate air pollution levels were 84 percent more likely to die than those in regions with low air pollution.</p> \n   <p>According to the European Environment Agency, air pollution leads to around 400,000 early deaths across the continent annually, despite European Union air quality directives.</p> \n   <p>One Covid-19 hotspot, northern Italy, has particularly high levels of PM10 - microscopic particles of pollution due largely to road traffic.</p> \n   <p>The number of fatalities in Italy shot up by 368 to 1,809 on Sunday - more than half of all the cases recorded outside China.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div

In Scotland, authorities will continue to test key workers, including critical frontline NHS staff, to ensure the people who are so essential to managing the disease but also keeping a critical infrastructure going are not self-isolating unnecessarily.</p> \n  <p>Scotland is taking the same approach to the rest of the UK in considering asking elderly people to reduce social contact amid the coronavirus outbreak, the first minister said.</p> \n  <p>Sturgeon would not comment in detail about the stringent approach other countries have taken, but said: \u201cI\u2019m not privy to the advice and decision making in those countries. My responsibility is to follow the scientific advice we\u2019ve been given, to interrogate and scrutinise that advice and to apply judgement to it.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The first minister said that Scotland has already taken \u201cquite significant steps\u201d to tackle the outbreak and possibly prevent a second severe spike. \u201cAsking everyone who has a fever or a cough to stay in their house for seven days is a significant step and behaviour change that we\u2019re asking people to apply.\u201d</p> \n  <p>She added: \u201cThat advice of course is about how we slow the spread and reduce the impact, but we do that in a way that perhaps avoids a later perhaps just as severe spike later on.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The Scottish government\u2019s ban on mass gathering does not currently apply to schools, travel, shopping and work. Dr Catherine Calderwood, Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer, described blanket school closures that lasted a few weeks as ineffective.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>[You need] a minimum of three months in order to really suppress the spread of the virus in these type of institutions. The thought that children won\u2019t mix together for three months is impossible. </p> \n   <p>We therefore risk having children congregate to other areas together, the virus is spread amongst them, so you actually have measures put in which are ineffective in keeping virus from those groups of children.</p> \n   <p>To compare talking about closing the schools for two weeks, it\u2019s very very clear from the science that is not a scientific way to either prevent the spread of the virus nor indeed to protect vulnerable people.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-16T12:46:30.592Z\">at 12.46pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6f6ed68f088d75755942f6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/graemewearden\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-16T12:23:11.073Z\">12.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Fears of the pandemic prompting a global recession have driven the FTSE 100 in the <strong>UK</strong> down 7.2% to 4976 points.

There was a testy exchange where Sanders criticised Biden for his refusal to disavow a super PAC supporting his candidacy and his past comments on potential cuts to social security.</li> \n   <li>Joe Biden<strong> </strong><strong>vowed to choose a woman as his running mate</strong> if he won the presidential nomination.
