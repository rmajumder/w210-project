  "<p>If cows lie down is it about to rain? Does red sky at night bring shepherd\u2019s delight? Some weather proverbs (like red sky) are more reliable than others (like cows) but&nbsp;<a href=\"https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/WCAS-D-19-0086.1\">research published in the journal Weather, Climate and Society</a>&nbsp;suggests weather proverbs may have been more accurate in the past.</p> <p>Piotr Matczak from the Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna\u0144, Poland, tested the accuracy of 28 Polish weather proverbs by comparing their prediction with weather station data. Many of the proverbs provided long-term weather predictions, and not surprisingly their accuracy was low \u2013 just three of the proverbs have an accuracy of greater than 50%. The proverb with greatest accuracy (83%) translates as, \u201cIf Saint Matthew (24 February) does not melt ice, peasants will long puff to warm their cold hands.\u201d</p> <p>Interestingly he found the proverbs were more accurate in the past. This might be partly due to changes in agricultural practices, which have altered the landscape and local climate, as well as the impacts of climate change. A greater accuracy in areas that are nowadays in Belarus, Lithuania and Ukraine, suggests that the movement of populations following the Second World War carried the proverbs some 200km westwards, to a land with differing climate characteristics.</p>",
  "<p>A man joins the Black Lives Matter demonstration in Melbourne and holds a placard \u201cAll lives matter\u201d. It\u2019s snatched from him and the police take him away while he is stating what many of those who have engaged in similar counter-sloganeering have stated before him: \u201cThere is nothing racist about this.\u201d</p> <p>While some veteran white supremacists, hypocritically, are familiar with the kind of blurring of reality that their counter-slogan is creating, other people I know still don\u2019t understand how offensive the proclamation \u201call lives matter\u201d is. So in the belief that some who genuinely misunderstand what is happening can be made to understand, and because it is useful to what I want to argue, let me explain what to many of us is obvious.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/11/nsw-supreme-court-blocks-refugee-rally-accusing-protesters-of-russian-roulette\">Sydney protests: police warn they will prosecute those who attend BLM and refugee rallies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Black Lives Matter is not an answer to an abstract question such as \u201cwhich lives matter?\u201d In today\u2019s context Black Lives Matter is directed at a racist culture which cheapens the lives of black people. It clearly means \u201cblack lives should also matter\u201d. It is an invitation to make visible the specific devalorisation of black lives in our society. That is why responding to Black Lives Matter with \u201call lives matter\u201d is racist. It tries to make this specific devalorisation invisible.&nbsp;</p> <p>Racists, as a rule, strive to make you visible when you want to be invisible, and to make you invisible when you wish to be visible. If you\u2019re trying to be one of the crowd, the racists will pull you out of that crowd, throw your difference at you and scream: \u201cHow dare you act as if you\u2019re one of the crowd? You are different!\u201d But if you say, \u201cI am being targeted because of my difference,\u201d the same racists will scream at you: \u201cHow dare you act as if you are different? You\u2019re just one of the crowd.\u201d The slogan \u201call lives matter\u201d works precisely in this way: \u201cLet\u2019s make your horrendous experience disappear by talking about \u2018all of us\u2019 rather than about you specifically.\u201d</p> <p>But if for some of us, anti-racist writers and activists, critiquing \u201call lives matter\u201d is relatively easy, what about the various acts of anti-racist solidarity that we and others engage in and that also end up decentring the black experience? </p> <p>For instance, while there are plenty of occasions where one can use anti-black racism to reflect on \u201cracism in general\u201d, and while there are also many occasions where one can equate racialised experiences and say, \u201cWe Palestinians, or we Holocaust survivors, know what it is like \u2026 ,\u201d there are times where such generalisation and equalisation achieve the same effacement of the specificity of anti-black racism as \u201call lives matter\u201d.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Racists strive to make you visible when you want to be invisible, and to make you invisible when you wish to be visible</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Do logics of generalisation and equalisation such as the above dilute specificity? The answer is not an easy yes or no, in the abstract. The question should invite us to reflect on when it can be a yes and when it can be a no. And there is no doubt that today, amid the Black Lives Matter demonstrations that are happening around the world, to engage in generalisations about \u201cracism\u201d, or in equalising forms of solidarity, is to participate in effacing the specificity and acuteness of anti-black racism.&nbsp;</p> <p>Anti-black racism is historically one of the most lethal racism there is. No one has to inherit the combined traumatic history of colonialism, slavery and racial exclusion the way black people do. The mere weight of this history has a racialising and chattering effect on those who carry it that is hard for any of us, including other racialised people, to comprehend. At the same time, everywhere around the world, black racism is perpetuated by being articulated to police brutality in a way that no other racism is. </p> <p>Police brutality inserts itself into the consciousness of a black person in the way the threat of rape inserts itself in the consciousness of women. For many, indeed for most, it is an ever-present danger. A change of a radical nature is required to bring this to an end.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/this-is-black-liberation-in-australia-the-time-is-here-to-be-on-the-right-side-of-history\">This is black liberation in Australia - the time is here to be on the right side of history | Lynda-June Coe for IndigenousX</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I receive an email from my university telling me that given what is happening in the US \u201cnow is the time to think about racism\u201d, and I think: that is not good enough.

Recently with Covid-19 we had to deal with the rise of anti-Asian racism. All are, of course, important and I am certain that it is good for the university to reflect on how it can think these racisms together to infuse a permanent anti- and non-racist culture on its campuses. </p> <p>But today, in the face of the traumatic events that black people have had to endure, what is communicated to us by protesters is clear: \u201cNow is the time to think about black people, to think about anti-black racism, and to do something concrete about combating it, particularly in relation to the foundational role of police brutality in perpetuating it.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s what I want my university to reflect on and do something about. Speak to its black students and staff, confront the question of police brutality towards black people inside and outside campuses, and do something concrete to support black students. The same goes for every institution anywhere. The killing of black people, followed by riots and outrage, followed by a return to the same order of things, is a familiar pattern.</p> <p>Protesters around the world are inviting us to make the<strong> </strong>slow and horrendous death of George Floyd the start of something different. And it should be easy to tell who is serious about starting the hard work of instituting something different and who will lazily return us back to more of the same.</p> <p>\u2022 Ghassan Hage is a professor of anthropology and social theory at the University of Melbourne</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/09/burundi-president-dies-illness-suspected-coronavirus-pierre-nkurunziz\">Pierre Nkurunziza</a>, who has died unexpectedly aged 55, was the outgoing president of Burundi whose 15-year-rule, particularly towards the end, was marked by brutal repression.</p> <p>In 2015, Nkurunziza\u2019s decision to run for an unconstitutional third term led to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/10/burundi-ethnic-violence-refugees\">an outbreak of protests and violence </a>that spread across the country. He responded with brutal violence. Over the next two years, his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/apr/19/un-human-rights-chief-condemns-grotesque-rape-chants-burundi-youth-militia\">youth-led militia group</a>, known as the Imbonerakure, as well as various state security forces, <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/09/fear-warns-burundi-atrocities-polls-190904133751594.html\">killed </a><a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/09/fear-warns-burundi-atrocities-polls-190904133751594.html\">more than 1,200 Burundians</a> in an attempt to quash street protests. Four hundred thousand more fled the country. A born-again Christian, Nkurunziza spent much of that time organising prayer meetings.</p> <p>When donors cut aid, he retaliated by barring most foreign media outlets from reporting inside Burundi. When the <a href=\"https://www.icc-cpi.int/burundi\">international criminal court (ICC) </a>opened an investigation into crimes against humanity in 2017, he responded by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/oct/28/burundi-becomes-first-nation-to-leave-international-criminal-court\">withdrawing Burundi from the Rome statute</a>; the first nation ever to do so. In 2019, he went a step further and shut down the <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=24254&amp;LangID=E\">U</a><a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=24254&amp;LangID=E\">N\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=24254&amp;LangID=E\">human rights office </a>in the country after 23 years, claiming he had made sufficient progress in human rights.</p> <p>Yet when Nkurunziza first came to power following the 1993-2005 Burundian civil war, which pitted Hutu rebels against the Tutsi-led army, he had seemed genuinely committed to the ideals of peace and democracy. As the leader of the CNDD\u2013FDD (National Council for the Defence of Democracy \u2013 Forces for the Defence of Democracy) Hutu rebel group, he had begun negotiating a peace deal in 2001. Two years later he signed the <a href=\"https://peacemaker.un.org/node/1207\">Arusha agreement</a>, which ended the civil war, in which 300,000 people died. He transformed his rebel group into a political party and joined the transition government as a minister for good governance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7a180bcca7db08b01c48deea4377ea52d8f88853\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a180bcca7db08b01c48deea4377ea52d8f88853/946_0_4526_3273/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pierre Nkurunziza, riding a bicycle, with his wife, Denise Bucumi, right, go to vote in the 2015 presidential election, in his birthplace of Ngozi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"723\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pierre Nkurunziza, riding a bicycle, with his wife, Denise Bucumi, right, go to vote in the 2015 presidential election, in his birthplace of Ngozi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Berthier Mugiraneza/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2005 Nkurunziza became president after his party won the elections by a landslide. A year later he lifted a curfew that had been in place since 1972. In 2007 Burundian soldiers joined an African Union (AU) peacekeeping force in troubled Somalia. The <a href=\"https://umoya.org/2009/03/13/burundi-paris-club-creditors-cancel-burundis-debt/\">Paris Club group</a> of creditors cancelled Burundi\u2019s debt in 2009.&nbsp;</p> <p>But after being re-elected with 92% of the vote in the 2010 poll, which was boycotted by many opposition candidates, Nkurunziza became increasingly authoritarian, power-hungry and intolerant. In 2014 <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-27818254\">he even banned jogging</a> out of \u201cfears it could be used by his opponents as a cover for subversion\u201d.</p> <p>Burundi was inching so close to another Hutu-Tutsi conflict that in 2016 the AU approved a pre-emptive deployment of a 5,000-strong <a href=\"https://theglobalobservatory.org/2016/02/burundi-nkurunziza-african-union-maprobu/\">African Prevention and Protection Mission </a>in Burundi, which has yet to be deployed because Nkurunziza objected to it.&nbsp;</p> <p>Colonisation has produced many crises that continue to haunt post-independence Africa but few have been as destructive as the Hutu-Tutsi divide. In neighbouring <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-26875506\">Rwanda in 1994 it fuelled a genocide in which 800,000 </a>mostly Tutsis were killed by the Hutus. Twenty years earlier, in Burundi, it led to a wave of mass killing of mostly Hutus by the Tutsi-led army following a failed Hutu coup in 1972. Experts estimated that more than 100,000 people were killed.</p> <p>Like Rwanda, the 1972 killings affected Burundi so deeply that it has become a defining political factor. Almost all recent Hutu leaders, including the country\u2019s first democratically elected president, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melchior_Ndadaye#:~:text=Melchior%20Ndadaye%20(March%2028%2C%201953,a%20Burundian%20intellectual%20and%20politician.&amp;text=His%20assassination%20sparked%20an%20array,decade%2Dlong%20Burundi%20Civil%20War.\">Melchior Ndadaye</a>, whose assassination triggered the 1993 civil war, was a 1972 refugee. Nkurunziza\u2019s father, Eustache Ngabisha, a former member of parliament and governor of Ngozi and Kayansi provinces, was a victim of the 1972 ethnic killings. Nkurunziza was eight years old at the time of his death.&nbsp;</p> <p>Born in Ngozi, Nkurunziza was the son of Ngabisha and of Domitille (nee Minani), a Tutsi assistant nurse. After his father\u2019s death, his family moved to Gitega, where Nkurunziza attended Athen\u00e9e de Gitega secondary school.</p> <p>A fitness enthusiast and keen footballer who in later life owned his own team, Hallelujah FC, Nkurunziza studied physical education at the University of Burundi. After graduation in 1990, he worked as a high school PE teacher at Muramvya high school. He married Denise Bucumi, who later became a pastor, in 1994.</p> <p>The following year, while working as a lecturer at the University of Burundi, in Bujumbura, Nkurunziza was shot at during a Tutsi attack on the campus, which killed hundreds of students. He joined one of several rebel Hutu groups, CNDD\u2013FDD, as a soldier.&nbsp;Two of his six siblings were killed after civil war erupted in 1993 and three others died while fighting with CNDD-FDD. By 1998 Nkurunziza was promoted to deputy secretary-general of the group, and in 2001 became its leader.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb01ebc0ae6464f3f642b53c6eb0b7a1da884e10\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb01ebc0ae6464f3f642b53c6eb0b7a1da884e10/0_11_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anti-government protestors in Bujumbura, 2015.

His fellow party member Evariste Ndayishimiye won last month\u2019s presidential election. Nkurunziza was elevated to the status of \u201cParamount Leader and Champion of Patriotism\u201d, a title that came with a $535,000 retirement package and villa.&nbsp;</p> <p>His cause of death was officially given as a heart attack, yet many suspect it was Covid-19.&nbsp;Ten days before his death, his wife was airlifted to Kenya for treatment for coronavirus symptoms, <a href=\"https://www.nation.co.ke/dailynation/news/burundi-first-lady-denise-nkurunziza-airlifted-to-nairobi-for-treatment-310894\">according to the Daily Nation</a>.

  "<p>The Irish alleged ringleader of a trafficking gang that transported a refrigerated truck in which 39 migrants died is to be extradited to Britain.</p> <p>A high court in Dublin on Friday ordered the extradition of Ronan Hughes, 40, to face 39 charges of manslaughter and a charge of assisting unlawful immigration.</p> <p>Hughes, a haulier with an address in County Monaghan near the border with Northern Ireland, allegedly masterminded the smuggling of 39 Vietnamese nationals who were found dead in a lorry container parked at an industrial estate in Grays, Essex, on 23 October last year.</p> <p>The eight women and 31 men and boys died from asphyxia and hyperthermia \u2013 a lack of oxygen and overheating, according to the Essex coroner. The truck, falsely declared as carrying biscuits, had travelled by ferry from Belgium.</p> <p>The high court rejected Hughes\u2019s appeal against extradition and ruled that the UK had jurisdiction to prosecute the alleged offences. Hughes did not speak during the hearing. He faces a life sentence if convicted.</p> <p>DS James Kirwan of the Garda\u2019s extradition section told the court that between 1 May 2018 and 24 October 2019 Hughes conspired with others to smuggle migrants illegally into the UK.</p> <p>The migrants were hidden in commercial trailers owned and operated by Hughes, who also organised the drivers, said Kirwan. Irish police believed Hughes had earned significant sums and had access to numerous vehicles, Kirwan added.</p> <p>In a separate ruling on Friday the court of appeal in Dublin rejected an appeal against extradition by Eamonn Harrison, who is wanted in Britain for his alleged role in transporting the trailer. Harrison, 23, from Mayobridge in County Down, was arrested at Dublin port last year on a European arrest warrant.</p> <p>Other alleged members of the smuggling network are in custody.</p> <p>Maurice Robinson, 25, who drove the truck in which the Vietnamese migrants were discovered, was arrested at the scene last October. Robinson, of Craigavon, Northern Ireland, pleaded guilty to 39 counts of manslaughter at the Old Bailey in London.</p> <p>Last month police in France arrested 13 people suspected of involvement in the operation while police in Belgium arrested another 13 people. On the same day police in Germany arrested a 29-year-old man suspected of organising the migrants\u2019 journey from Asia.

  "<p>Just as trailers for the BBC\u2019s Windrush drama <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p08g29ff/sitting-in-limbo\">Sitting in Limbo</a> were released at the start of this month, Anthony Bryan, who was wrongly imprisoned for five weeks after mistakenly being classified as an illegal immigrant, and whose story is dramatised in the film, received an interim offer of compensation from the Home Office. It was two and a half years after officials first realised they had made an error, and more than two years since the then prime minister, Theresa May first apologised for the Home Office\u2019s mistakes. The compensation letter came exactly a week before the film was due to go out on television, and the timing of its arrival made him very thoughtful.</p> <p>A few days before Sitting in Limbo was broadcast, emails and calls started coming from the private office of the home secretary, Priti Patel, asking if Bryan would join a video call with her just an hour before the film went out. The home secretary is \u201cactively thinking\u201d about \u201cgiving a voice\u201d to the Windrush generation, one email read, \u201cand feels it vitally important to hear directly from affected members of the community, such as Mr Bryan\u201d.</p> <p>Bryan felt sceptical about the timing of this invitation, and declined. Meanwhile Home Office staff were pestering the film\u2019s makers to let them have an early preview \u2013 without success.</p> <p>These are standard Home Office damage-limitation manoeuvres,<strong> </strong>without any effective action to address the underlying problem. (And none of the other 30 Windrush claimants being supported by the North Kensington Law Centre, which has been helping Bryan, received compensation offers this month or had invitations to have phone calls with the home secretary, staff there told me.)</p> <p>Clearly the unfolding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter protests</a> and the focus on Britain\u2019s own difficulties with racism are making ministers particularly anxious to be seen to be doing the right thing on Windrush. They will be uneasily aware that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/18/revealed-depth-of-home-office-failures-on-windrush\">not enough has been done to put things right</a>. This is not a centuries-old problem that can be shrugged off as history, but the direct consequence of hostile environment measures that remain a central part of government policy.</p> <p>Of course, giving people a voice and listening is great, but much careful listening has already been done, and those affected by the scandal have for months been saying that now is the time to move on to action. A forensic 275-page analysis of what went wrong, based on detailed interviews with hundreds of those affected, was <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/874022/6.5577_HO_Windrush_Lessons_Learned_Review_WEB_v2.pdf\">submitted to the Home Office in March</a>. One of the key recommendations made by its author, Wendy Williams, was a call for a full review of the government\u2019s \u201chostile environment\u201d measures.</p> <p>But none of the policies that caused the Windrush scandal have been repealed, and Patel has made no commitment to reverse them. She tweeted new apologies as the programme was broadcast, lamenting the \u201cunimaginable suffering endured by the Windrush generation\u201d, but <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/windrush-lessons-learned-review\">seems to have shown little interest in looking again at the structure of immigration legislation</a>, which continues to cause so much suffering to thousands of people living entirely legally in the UK.<strong> </strong>In this regard, her stance echoes that of Nick Timothy, May\u2019s former special adviser, and one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/19/theresa-may-was-not-opposed-to-go-home-vans-official-accounts-suggest\">key architects of the hostile environment</a>, who last week breezily asserted that it was a \u201csensible\u201d policy. He added that he was \u201ccertainly never warned\u201d that there was a cohort of people who might get trapped in its embrace because they were unable to prove that they were living in the UK legally.</p> <p>Both of these points are highly questionable. After all the life-shattering problems the policies have caused, \u201csensible\u201d seems a peculiar word to have chosen. They<strong> </strong>deliberately made life impossible for tens of thousands of people without documentation, introducing workplace immigration checks, and eligibility checks for healthcare, bank accounts, pensions, driving licences, rental contracts and benefits. It was the hostile environment that caused Bryan to get the sack from his job as a decorator, and saw him formally categorised as an illegal resident (despite having lived in London since arriving as an eight-year-old in 1965), arrested, detained and booked on a flight back to Jamaica, a country he hadn\u2019t visited in more than 50 years.</p> <p>The hostile environment policies introduced new levels of spite into society; the government set up the National Allegations Database, designed to make it easier for people to make tip-offs about immigration offenders to the Home Office.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not even clear that these \u201csensible\u201d measures have succeeded in their stated goal of addressing illegal immigration, as a handful of reports from the <a href=\"https://www.nao.org.uk/report/handling-of-the-windrush-situation/\">National Audit Office</a>, the <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567652/ICIBI-hostile-environment-driving-licences-and-bank-accounts-January-to-July-2016.pdf\">Borders and Immigration Inspectorate</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/15/mps-criticise-error-hit-hostile-environment-illegal-immigrants\">Home Affairs </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/15/mps-criticise-error-hit-hostile-environment-illegal-immigrants\">select </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/15/mps-criticise-error-hit-hostile-environment-illegal-immigrants\">committee</a> concluded. What is clear is that large numbers of people who came to the UK legally, but who struggle to prove their status, are still being denied healthcare, formal employment and stable housing; the policies institutionalise cruelty and drive people underground.</p> <p>Timothy\u2019s assertion that he was never warned is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/22/government-aware-for-years-that-hostile-environment-hurt-windrush-generation\">contradicted by so much evidence</a> that it feels disingenuous. His own department\u2019s impact assessments warned that these policies could hurt people who had been in the UK for decades, but who had no documentation. Every migration and race organisation<strong> </strong>united to warn that racially discriminatory consequences would follow. A Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants lawyer remembers a junior immigration minister rolling his eyes at her warnings when she gave evidence in parliament. They were warned; they just didn\u2019t want to listen, she says. </p> <p>Timothy\u2019s comments matter because the government continues to cling on to these cruel policies in spite of their damaging impact on so many, including thousands of the key workers who have been supporting Britain throughout the pandemic. The hostile environment also gave us the NHS surcharge in 2015, which, until a sudden U-turn last month, required doctors and care workers to pay for the right to access the care they were providing, and which they were already paying for through taxation. It has also increased visa charges so exponentially that families are pushed into destitution as they try to pay recurring immigration costs. Many are forced into illegality because they cannot afford the exorbitant cost of regularising their status.</p> <p>The Home Office has spent two years in a legal battle over whether the rent to right policy \u2013 which requires landlords to check on tenants\u2019 immigration status \u2013 is racially discriminatory. The high court said it was; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/21/right-to-rent-rule-justified-finds-uk-appeal-court\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/21/right-to-rent-rule-justified-finds-uk-appeal-court\">court of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/21/right-to-rent-rule-justified-finds-uk-appeal-court\">appeal agreed it could be,</a> but ruled that the scheme was nevertheless \u201cjustified\u201d; a new appeal is under way. </p> <p>In her review into what caused Windrush, Williams makes it clear that officials should be actively educating themselves. The department\u2019s failings on Windrush demonstrate an \u201cinstitutional ignorance and thoughtlessness towards the issue of race and the history of the Windrush generation\u201d that is \u201cconsistent with some elements of the definition of institutional racism\u201d, she concluded. The scandal was able to happen, she added \u201cbecause of the public\u2019s and officials\u2019 poor understanding of Britain\u2019s colonial history \u2026 and the history of black Britons\u201d.</p> <p>Two years ago, the then home secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/06/sajid-javid-plans-fairer-more-compassionate-immigration-system\">Sajid Javid, promised to review the immigration system</a> to ensure it was working in a compassionate, fair and humane way; we are still waiting for that review. Only 60 people have received Windrush compensation payments \u2013 which is why last-minute invitations to video chats with the home secretary do not feel welcome.</p> <p>\u2022 Amelia Gentleman is a Guardian reporter.

It also raises intriguing questions of what should be done with the empty spaces potentially left behind.</p> <p>For some, the eruption of the Black Lives Matter movement and the call to decolonise education provides an important opportunity to shine a spotlight on historical figures Britain should <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/11/we-must-go-further-than-toppling-statues\">instead be commemorating</a>.</p> <p>Here are six black Britons who had a momentous impact on the UK\u2019s history. While some already have statues and are recognised in the school curriculum, campaigners say many do not have the profile they deserve.</p> <h2>William Cuffay, 1788-1870</h2> <p>Born on a merchant ship in the West Indies in 1788, Cuffay was the son of a naval cook and former enslaved person from St Kitts. The family eventually settled in Chatham, Kent.</p> <p>Cuffay played a leading role in the Chartist movement and was considered one of its most militant leaders. In 1842 he was elected to the national executive of the National Charter Association. His significance within the movement was highlighted by a contemporary report in the Times that referred to the chartists as \u201cthe black man and his party\u201d.</p> <p>In August 1848, Cuffay was arrested for conspiring to levy war against the Queen and was sentenced to transportation to Tasmania.</p> <h2>Mary Seacole, 1805-81</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d7cff0bacf05a7f38f66f1cdf5099a08004e604\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d7cff0bacf05a7f38f66f1cdf5099a08004e604/0_67_918_551/500.jpg\" alt=\"A statue commemorating Mary Seacole in the grounds of St Thomas\u2019 hospital in London\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A statue commemorating Mary Seacole in the grounds of St Thomas\u2019 hospital in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mary Seacole Memorial Statue Appeal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Born in Kingston, Jamaica, to a Jamaican woman and a Scottish soldier, Seacole was a nurse who funded her own trip from Britain to the Crimea to take part in the war effort. She risked her life going out on the frontline and frequently came under fire while bringing support to wounded and dying soldiers.</p> <p>After the war she returned to England and became destitute and unwell. After the press highlighted her plight, a benefit festival was organised in Kennington, south London, to raise money for her. The fundraiser is believed to have attracted 1,000 people. </p> <p>In 1857, Seacole published her memoirs, The Wonderful Adventures of Mrs Seacole in Many Lands. A statue of Seacole was erected opposite the Houses of Parliament in the grounds of St Thomas\u2019 hospital in 2016.</p> <h2>Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, 1875-1912</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"651703d994e62dbdbe6da92fc5e726dd70bdb172\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/651703d994e62dbdbe6da92fc5e726dd70bdb172/0_190_1600_1999/800.jpg\" alt=\"Samuel Coleridge Taylor\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Samuel Coleridge Taylor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Born in Holborn, London, on 15 August 1875 and raised in Croydon, Coleridge-Taylor was one of few black classical composers to catch the imagination of the white British musical establishment.</p> <p>He came to prominence in 1898 at the Gloucester festival with an orchestral Ballade in A Minor, followed by his much acclaimed trilogy Hiawatha\u2019s Wedding Feast (1898), which Sir Hubert Parry, the principal of the Royal College of Music, described as \u201cone of the most remarkable events in modern English musical history\u201d.</p> <p>Coleridge-Taylor died aged 37 after he collapsed at West Croydon station while waiting for a train. His funeral procession through Croydon was lined for three and a half miles by crowds with their heads bared.</p> <h2>Claudia Jones, 1915-64</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"db5d5e77954c2a2fcf4cf2426a9743ba7fd36daf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db5d5e77954c2a2fcf4cf2426a9743ba7fd36daf/0_215_2981_3726/800.jpg\" alt=\"Claudia Jones\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Claudia Jones.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keystone/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Born in Belmont, Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, in 1915, she lived much of her life in New York before she was deported from the US for being an active member of the US Communist party. She was given asylum in England in 1955.</p> <p>Jones threw herself into the anti-racist struggle in the UK, founding the West Indian Gazette and launched the Notting Hill carnival, which was held in 1959 in response to racist attacks and rioting. The carnival was put together to celebrate the culture of the local community because, according to a brochure handed out during the time, \u201ca people\u2019s art is the genesis of their freedom\u201d.</p> <p>Jones died in 1964 and she is buried next to the Karl Marx memorial at Highgate cemetery.</p> <h2>Olive Morris, 1952-79</h2> <p>Born in Jamaica in 1952, Morris moved to south London as a young child with her siblings to be with her parents.</p> <p>Morris was just 17 when she became a leading figure in Britain\u2019s anti-racism movement in the 1960s and 70s, organising actions against discrimination in housing and employment, stop and search and attacks by far-right groups such as the National Front. Morris was a member of the youth section of the Black Panther movement in the UK.</p> <p>She became ill while on holiday in Spain and was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, a form of cancer, upon returning home. She died aged 27 on 12 July 1979 at St Thomas\u2019 hospital in London.</p> <h2>Jack Leslie, 1901-88</h2> <p>Born in 1901 in Canning Town, London, Leslie played for Plymouth Argyle from 1921 until he retired in 1934 and was the only professional black footballer in England at the time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8ec971c4fa5b6dea2aaeed1237ce7691de08ba5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8ec971c4fa5b6dea2aaeed1237ce7691de08ba5/0_383_3575_2145/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jack Leslie training with Plymouth Argyle in August 1926.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack Leslie training with Plymouth Argyle in August 1926</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gill/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Leslie was expected to become England\u2019s first black player, but he was denied the opportunity when selectors became aware of his heritage.</p> <p>The Jack Leslie Campaign, which has the backing of Leslie\u2019s family, is <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/jack-leslie-footballer-statue-plymouth_uk_5ee213e7c5b68c338976c113\">calling for a statue of the footballer</a> as a celebration of black achievement.</p>",
  "<p>For the past five days, Bijendra Singh has been haunted by the voice of his dead wife, Neelam. \u201cWhy could you not get me the treatment that I needed?\u201d she asks. \u201cWhy could you not save me, save our baby?\u201d</p> <p>It was around 6am on 5 June when Neelam, more than eight months pregnant, began complaining of lower back pain and breathlessness. Presuming it was early contractions, Singh and his wife set off in his brother\u2019s auto-rickshaw to a government hospital in the Uttar Pradesh city of Noida. Before leaving, they kissed their five year-old son goodbye and promised they would be returning with the birthday present he had requested: a baby sister.</p> <p>However, because of her suspected Covid-19 symptoms, they were refused entry at eight hospitals. It was to be a 15-hour ordeal that would expose how the coronavirus pandemic has pushed India\u2019s healthcare system to the brink of collapse, and would result in the needless death of 30-year-old Neelam.</p> <p>\u201cFrom the beginning of this pandemic, the government completely underestimated the virus,\u201d said Dr Harjit Singh Bhatti, who works on the Covid-19 ward of Delhi\u2019s Manipal hospital. \u201cWe had over two months of lockdown, but all that time was wasted. We have not seen any investment in healthcare, which will be the only way to get this under control.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cEvery day I see the number of patients are rising, while hospital admission is becoming impossible and many are dying outside hospitals. Healthcare workers are all getting infected in droves and our healthcare system in Delhi is already exhausted. If strong steps are not taken now, I expect the healthcare system to collapse in a few weeks.\u201d</p> <p>On Monday, India began <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/11/global-report-india-reports-surge-in-covid-19-cases-as-lockdown-eased\">easing its coronavirus lockdown</a>, one of the largest and strictest in the world, with shopping malls and places of worship opening their doors for the first time in more than two months. It joined countries such as neighbouring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/10/global-report-who-urges-pakistan-to-return-to-lockdown-as-hospitals-struggle\">Pakistan</a> as well as Mexico, Russia and Iran, who, despite escalating infection rates, have decided to ease restrictions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54fbf89dd9567c577a4eedc52a4fee426587524b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54fbf89dd9567c577a4eedc52a4fee426587524b/0_344_6937_4163/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cleaning staff throw medical waste into a bin at Guru Nanak Dev hospital, Amritsar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cleaning staff throw medical waste into a bin at Guru Nanak Dev hospital, Amritsar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Narinder Nanu/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cases in India, currently at 298,000, are increasing by 10,000 a day and the country has overtaken the UK to become the fourth worst hit in the world. India\u2019s biggest cities of Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai are running out of not only beds but also doctors and nurses to treat the unprecedented numbers of patients, and university medical professors have been seconded to work on Covid wards. Private hospitals have been charging upwards of 80,000 rupees (\u00a3840) per night for those who are admitted with Covid symptoms \u2013 unaffordable prices for even middle-class let alone poorer Indians.</p> <p>Singh, a factory worker from Khora Colony in Ghaziabad, took his wife first to a government hospitalin the neighbouring city of Noida. But the doctor insisted they could not admit her. It was to become a familiar refrain. At another hospital nearby, an ambulance driver refused to go near Neelam because he suspected she had Covid-19, and she was refused admission. They then went to the private Shivalik hospital. \u201cBut again the doctor said there, sorry, this looks like a Covid case, we don\u2019t have ventilators or beds,\u201d said Singh.</p> <p>They tried eight hospitals, each time being denied entry because medics suspected from Neelam\u2019s breathing troubles that she had Covid-19, although she was never tested.</p> <p>\u201cAt the fourth hospital, I broke down, pleading with them, telling them I had been going around hospitals all morning. They told me \u2018we cannot treat her, she will die here\u2019,\u201d said Singh. \u201cMy wife was shouting out: \u2018I need oxygen, I need painkillers, please help me,\u2019 but no one listened to her.\u201d</p> <p>By the time the couple reached their next hope, Sharda hospital, they were so desperate that they paid for Neelam to be transferred to an ambulance so she could have access to an oxygen tank.</p> <p>At the seventh hospital, Gims hospital in Noida, when it too refused to admit her, Singh called the police. \u201cI could not bring myself to go back into the ambulance and face her. She kept telling me: \u2018I won\u2019t survive much longer, please get me help, you are not doing anything for me.\u2019 At this point I lost all my strength.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f93f774203d82fdfba3ea0738429e89c067e363\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f93f774203d82fdfba3ea0738429e89c067e363/0_0_5544_3326/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A colleague helps a nurse put on PPE in Max hospital, New Delhi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A colleague helps a nurse put on PPE in Max hospital, New Delhi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Atish Patel/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But even the two officers could not get her a bed. Singh and Neelam drove 30 miles to the Max hospital in Ghaziabad, where again doctors walked him into the ward to show him it was full, so they drove back to Gims. \u201cBut when we got there, I pulled the oxygen mask off my wife\u2019s face and she was dead,\u201d said Singh.</p> <p>\u201cPlease know I did everything to save her and my baby. It is not my fault, the system is broken.\u201d</p> <p>The consequences of a pandemic in India, a poverty-stricken and densely populated country that spends just 1% of GDP on healthcare, are becoming more apparent by the day.</p> <p>Hospital morgues are overflowing with bodies: Delhi\u2019s LNJP hospital morgue, which has capacity for 45 bodies, last week had 108 piled up. Nigambodh Ghat, New Delhi\u2019s biggest and oldest crematorium, has begun building traditional funeral pyres because their furnaces cannot keep up with the number of bodies, around 30 a day more than usual. They have performed more than 500 coronavirus-related funerals in the past two months.</p> <p>Delhi\u2019s deputy chief minister, Manish Sisodia, has said the capital will have more than 500,000 Covid-19 cases by July and will need to increase the number of beds from 9,000 to 80,000 to meet demand. \u201cFor Delhi, this is a big problem if cases continue to rise,\u201d Sisodia said.</p> <p>Balram Bhargava, the director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research, insisted India was still \u201cdefinitely not\u201d in a community transmission stage of the outbreak, even though officials in Delhi admitted they knew the source of only around 50% of infections. But this was rejected by Bhatti, the Covid-19 doctor. \u201cThe claims of no community transmission is rubbish, it is only to save the government from criticism and so they can avoid spending more money on hospitals and manpower,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Only 5m tests have been done in a country of 1.3 billion people. And while India\u2019s official death toll of 8,102 is comparatively low, some analysts believe this may be due to rampant under-reporting and also the fact that 65% of India\u2019s population is below the age of 35, compared with nations with more vulnerable, ageing populations.</p> <p>Even the home minister, Amit Shah, admitted in a speech on Monday that the government, which last month announced a stimulus package billed as being worth $266bn, \u201cmay have made a mistake, we may have fallen short\u201d in the fight against the virus.</p> <p>The situation has become so bad that not even money and influence can pull the usual strings. Resident associations for affluent neighbourhoods have begun buying their own oxygen supplies. In Delhi\u2019s Greater Kailash I (GK1), an upmarket area in south Delhi, the residents\u2019 association has purchased two oxygen concentrator machines, while in the housing complex of Eldeco Utopia in Noida, residents have bought 20 oximeters and sequestered five rooms, equipping them with oxygen cylinders, a stretcher, a wheelchair and PPE kit.</p> <p>\u201cThe bubble we lived in has burst,\u201d said Rajiv Kakria, an adviser to the GK1 residents\u2019 association. \u201cYou can have money. You can have connections and know influential people, but it doesn\u2019t mean anything. You can still die waiting for a bed or oxygen.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Welcome to this week\u2019s roundup of developments from the coronavirus pandemic. As more countries ease out of lockdown, scientists shed light on how the virus attacks and raise questions over the wastewater that drains from sinks and bathrooms.</p> \n<h2>Lockdowns work</h2> \n<p>Substantial lockdowns around the world have taken their toll on millions of lives and dented economies globally. So it was a relief to hear that the bluntest tool of all in the outbreak management toolbox did actually work. Lockdowns in Europe saved more than 3 million lives, including an estimated 470,000 in the UK, 690,000 in France, and 630,000 in Italy, according to researchers at Imperial College London.</p> \n<p>Outbreak modellers found that lockdowns slashed the average number of people that contagious individuals infected by 81%. In the UK, that amounted to lowering the all-important reproduction number of the virus, R, from 3.8 to 0.63, the researchers <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2405-7\">reported in Nature</a>. In 11 countries from France and Germany to Spain and Italy, lockdowns pushed the R value below one, meaning the epidemics went into decline.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/10/global-report-eu-nations-continue-steady-exits-from-lockdown\">Global report: EU nations continue steady exits from lockdown</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The modelling showed that by 4 May between 12 million and 15 million people in those countries had been infected by coronavirus but \u201cattack rates\u201d varied dramatically, from 0.46% of Norwegians infected to 8% of Belgians. In the UK an estimated 5.1% of people were infected. Prof Axel Gandy, a statistician on the team, said the model suggested \u201cwe are very far away from herd immunity\u201d, where at least two-thirds of the population need to have acquired protective immunity to the disease. \u201cWe need to tread very carefully,\u201d he added.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2404-8\">More work on lockdowns</a> came from the University of California, Berkeley. Scientists there estimated that lockdowns in the US, France, China, South Korea and Iran had prevented about 530m infections. The research came as New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, declared the country virus-free and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/08/new-zealand-abandons-covid-19-restrictions-after-nation-declared-no-cases\">scrapped all coronavirus restrictions</a>, except strict border controls.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"634b5ed6-bc05-4cf6-9564-3cf587cdcfc3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gTskXsdMwc0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Enter the virus</strong></h2> \n<p>Scientists worked out early on how the virus invades human cells and establishes infections. Spikes on the virus bind to so-called ACE-2 receptors that pepper the surfaces of many human cells, most importantly those in the respiratory tract. Once latched on, the virus gains entry and replicates over and over, until millions burst out to infect more cells.</p> \n<p>But that might not be the only way in. Separate teams led by the Technical University of Munich and Bristol University found that the virus attaches to a second human cell receptor called NRP1. Like ACE-2, it peppers cells in the respiratory tract, but it is also abundant in olfactory tissues, those that are used to smell.</p> \n<p>Both groups found that blocking the receptor prevented the virus from infecting human cells in the lab, adding weight to the idea that it is important. What is most intriguing about the receptor is that it may be a gateway to the brain, and in particular allow the virus to reach olfactory centres and potentially disrupt the sense of smell.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.07.137802v2\">two</a> <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.05.134114v1\">papers</a> are tentative for now and have yet to be published in scientific journals. But if the results are sound, they might explain some of the disease\u2019s stranger symptoms and help to steer future vaccine design.</p> \n<h2><strong>Keep your distance</strong></h2> \n<p>Politicians on either sides of the Atlantic became embroiled in debates over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/10/science-behind-coronavirus-distancing-rules-2-metre\">safe distancing</a>. The US vice-president, Mike Pence, posted \u2013 and then swiftly deleted \u2013 a photo of President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign staff displaying zero physical distancing. Meanwhile in the UK, the Tories <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/11/mps-pressure-boris-johnson-cut-2-metre-distancing-rule-tories-covid-19-england-uk-economy\">piled pressure on Boris Johnson</a> to reduce the 2-metre distancing guideline to 1 metre, amid concerns for the economy, in particular pubs, cafes and restaurants. Johnson made clear <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/09/englands-2-metre-distancing-rule-still-under-review\">he wants to ease the rule</a>, but uncertainty around whether the advice will be changed has caused chaos for councils and retailers, who may have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/11/uncertainty-over-2-metre-distancing-rule-in-england-causing-chaos\">wasted millions of pounds</a> on signs and other preparations for reopening the high streets.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/10/science-behind-coronavirus-distancing-rules-2-metre\">What is the science behind the UK's coronavirus distancing rules?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Prof Susan Michie, who sits on the behavioural science subgroup of the government\u2019s Sage committee of experts, said reducing the distance to 1m would undermine messages of how the virus is transmitted. \u201cIt seems to me that now is not the time to be lifting restrictions unless there\u2019s a very good argument.

Previous research has shown that the virus can survive for anything from four hours on a copper surface to five days on glass, with cardboard, plastic and wood all lying somewhere between. What was less clear was how often domestic objects and surfaces are contaminated with the virus.</p> \n<p>A team of virologists at the University of Bonn hunted for the virus in air samples, wastewater and on surfaces in 21 randomly selected households. All were in quarantine after at least one member had tested positive for the virus. None of the air samples tested positive for the virus, but among the water samples taken from sinks, showers and toilets, 15.5% contained the virus. Strikingly, tests on 119 surfaces, including door knobs, handles, electronic gadgets, furnishings, food and drink items, clothes, plants and pets, yielded only four positives. These came from one TV remote control, two metal doorknobs and one wooden stove overlay. The scientists could not grow infectious virus from any of the samples they collected.</p> \n<p>The researchers are not suggesting that people ease up on hand-washing or cleaning surfaces, particularly when sharing a home with an infected person. But <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.28.20114041v1\">the work</a>, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, suggests that while wastewater deserves more attention, surfaces may not be a major source of infection.</p>",

Those changes include lifting the 100 person limit on gatherings due in stage 3 of the plan which most states move to from next month. Instead the 1 person per 4sqm rule will apply.</li> \n   <li>Plans are also under way for easing of restrictions on large gatherings. Stadiums that can seat up to 40,000 people will be able to host 10,000 people under step 3.</li> \n   <li>The prime minister, Scott Morrison, confirmed planning has commenced to allow the safe return of international students to Australia.</li> \n   <li>South Australia set a date of 20 July for the reopening of its borders. Queensland is aiming for 10 July.</li> \n   <li>Rose Bay Public School in Sydney closed due to a suspected covid-19 case that was later confirmed to be positive.</li> \n   <li>Black Lives Matter protestors gathered at Sydney\u2019s Town Hall and Hyde Park on Friday night to draw attention to Australia\u2019s record on Indigenous deaths in custody. They were met with a large police presence.</li> \n   <li> Scott Morrison apologised after he incorrectly stated Australia had no history of slavery.<br></li> \n   <li>NSW postponed local government elections until 2021.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Thank you for joining us.

But the Prime Minister is refusing to rule out kicking workers in other industries off JobSeeker before September. Why can\u2019t the Prime Minister be clear - which Australians will he leave behind? <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison:</strong><br></p> \n  <p>From the very outset of this crisis, the Government has put in place the most comprehensive, the largest set of income support and economic lifeline measures that this country has ever seen. And the one we started with was JobSeeker, because JobSeeker, the unemployment benefit is the safety net that sits right under all Australians if they find themselves out of work. That\u2019s what we did first. <br></p> \n  <p>The second measure, substantial measure that we put in place for income support was JobKeeper. Now, JobKeeper was put in to ensure that Australians could find themselves continuing to be on the books of employers and doing some work in some cases, and they would be there in that arrangement for six months. <br></p> \n  <p>That has bought our economy critical time. If businesses were put in a position that they had to make decisions back in March and April about whether those employees could stay in those businesses, we would have seen millions more find themselves on their way seeking support through the unemployment system. <br></p> \n  <p>Now, Mr Speaker, that decision bought those businesses time. It bought Australia time. When other countries were only going for three months, we took the decision to go for six months. <br></p> \n  <p>And that provided some certainty and confidence, and since that time, we have seen consumer confidence restored under the ANZ Index, and 70% restore by business since the COVID crisis hit. Now we are going through the same thoughtful, meticulous process of considering the data and looking forward and reviewing the program to make the right set of decisions about the right combination of income supports and fiscal supports to the economy that would be in place after the end of September. <br></p> \n  <p>This is how our Government makes decisions. We do things carefully, considering the advice, looking at the economic environment and ensure that we make those decisions at the right time. <br></p> \n  <p>JobKeeper is there until the end of September, Mr Speaker. That\u2019s why we put it in place. It will remain in place until the end of September. <br></p> \n  <p>And Mr Speaker, it will continue to provide that confidence. At the same time, the Treasurer and I and the members of the Cabinet will work together with the members of the Government to ensure that we get the right balance and mix of fiscal policies, because it\u2019s the fiscal policies, given the absence of monetary ammunition that\u2019s in the system that will be so important. But we want, above all things, above all things, is to get Australians back into jobs. <strong>Australians don\u2019t want to be on JobKeeper or JobSeeker. They want to be in jobs, Mr Speaker.</strong> <br></p> \n  <p>And what we hear from the Opposition all the time is how they would seek to keep people back, not allow them to go forward. And the policies we will put in place and continue to put in place will be about them - not only getting the support they need when they need it.

Why does the prime minister need another review to tell him that Teddy\u2019s sacrifice should be honoured with a Victoria Cross? </p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison: t</strong>here is absolutely no doubt that Teddy Sheean was an extraordinary Australian who did extraordinary things. At a time that none of us in this place can possibly imagine. And the issues that were confronted by servicemen and women at that time is nothing we can imagine. Their commanders and those who were there at that time and made judgment on these issues. So when one goes back and looks at these matters again, one must be very careful when they\u2019re putting themselves in the place of others who were there at the time.</p> \n  <p> Now, Mr Speaker, the tribunal, the four members of the tribunal, not all 11, but the four members of it, was unanimous. Not 11, just four. I point that out to the leader of the opposition. As he represented that all 11 members of the tribunal made that decision. That is in fact not the case. There was four, Mr Speaker. </p> \n  <p>But Mr Speaker, equally, then the government receives the recommendation from the tribunal, the government then needs to consider that recommendation informing a view, and indeed, the minister and then the prime minister needs to form a view. And so you take advice from all of the agencies that would have a relevant view on this, as I have done. <br></p> \n  <p>And I tabled, Mr Speaker, the letter from the chief of the defence force, Gen Campbell, for the purposes of the question and for the House. I can assure you, as prime minister and as chair of the national security committee of cabinet, that I do not consider the advice of the chief of the defence Force lightly. I consider it very carefully. And it wasn\u2019t just the current chief of defence force, Mr Speaker. Not just the current chief of the defence force that I have consulted on this matter. But many others, many others, Mr Speaker, who have served in that capacity in recent times. <br></p> \n  <p>So I\u2019m not going to consider the advice that comes from the single person who commands every single man, woman who serves in our defence forces lightly. So the issue that is raised in relation to this matter, Mr Speaker, is whether compelling new evidence has been presented and is available for me to take a decision that would enable me to make a recommendation to Her Majesty. <br></p> \n  <p>Now Mr Speaker, that matter, on my advice, is in dispute, and so I have sought advice from the former defence minister, the former solicitor general, the former secretary of the department of prime minister and cabinet, and one of the most renowned military historians in this country, to consider that very precise question. And Mr Speaker, if that advice comes back and says that very high bar has been passed, then that is helpful advice. And I can assure you, because I consulted the chief of the defence force on this matter. </p> \n  <p>Albanese tries to table the document, but a snippy <strong>Christian Porter </strong>says it is a public document, so no.

The shadow minister wants to bring out quotes. I\u2019ve got a lot of quotes for the shadow minister.

It will mean more new homes, more small businesses and jobs are protected and provide a stronger bridge to the economic recovery of our country.\u2019 And it goes on and on and on. In fact, I\u2019ll continue. I\u2019ll continue if we\u2019ve got quotes. <br></p> \n   <p>We\u2019ve got a home builder, Jessie Zilkie from Bundaberg ,who said the following in response. On the first Saturday after the homebuilder was announced, the response that they had for the house and land packages, she said the following. <br></p> \n   <p>\u2018We\u2019re gearing up. I\u2019ve employed three people this week in various roles. I\u2019ve been in contact with some subcontractors, suppliers, to make sure that we can handle it. It\u2019s certainly going to be a boost locally to jobs and the industry.\u2019 It goes on and on. In the Domain article that the shadow minister referred to, in that Domain article, it referred to the fact that house and land packages throughout this country increased last Saturday by up to 70%. <br></p> \n   <p>Now what do new home sales mean? It means what I said earlier this week. The hundreds of thousands of jobs in the residential construction industry are protected. Now I know the shadow minister probably hasn\u2019t come across a tradie. He\u2019s been here a bit too long in the halls of Canberra. <br></p> \n   <p>But hundreds of thousands of tradies, carpenters on building sites, bricklayers, electricians and plumbers and in regional Australia \u2013 the timber mill workers who make the frames and trusses. <br></p> \n   <p>The manufacturers who make the bricks and the glass and the tiles. Those hundreds of thousands of jobs will be protected. We estimate 20,000 new homes. 7,000 substantial rebuilds, and those 20,000 new homes we\u2019ve also seen evidence is overwhelmingly supporting new home-buyer, so the Labor party have opposed the first home super saver scheme. They opposed the first home loan deposit scheme.

The scheme provides for 27,000 new projects, which is 7,000 renovation/new builds. And 20,000 new home constructions. It was never the intention of this program to provide subsidy support for small-scale renovations.</p> \n   <p> That was not the purpose. And I\u2019ll tell you why we weren\u2019t going to do that. We weren\u2019t going to do that because the risk of integrity to the program and a repeat of the insulation batts farce that occurred under the Labor party, where people were going around knocking on doors, basically pulling in pink batts and saying that they\u2019re going to put them in your roof and pocketing the difference was a joke. <br></p> \n   <p>It was a complete failure, Mr Speaker. Four people died, Mr Speaker, in relation to that program. They died as a result of that program as established in a royal commission. I note, I note Mr Speaker, in a royal commission. <br></p> \n   <p> So in this program, we were not going to give rise to a situation where people passing themselves off as renovators were going to go and knock on the doors of pensioners, rip out their sinks and dishwashers and then seek to claim some government subsidy. That\u2019s not the nature of the program. <br></p> \n   <p>This is not for do-it-yourself home renovations. This is about approved work by certified builders of significant scale to enable people to bring forward projects that they have put off and now can proceed with. <br></p> \n   <p>Now I note the derision that is applied by those opposite to someone who might be proceeding with a substantial renovation, a new build of their home, of some $150,000. The average loan taken out for a renovation is $164,000.</p> \n   <p> And I can tell you that\u2019s the case, because there are families around this country who cannot afford to go and build a new home. Their families are expanding. Their children are growing up. They can\u2019t afford to sell their house and go and buy land and engage in a new construction. So what do they do? They borrow money to expand their existing home and renovate substantially their existing home, because they can\u2019t afford to build a $300,000 or $350,000 new home. <br></p> \n   <p><strong>The opposition\u2019s derision of this initiative smacks of two things.

People have told me that they want to rebuild, but it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll be able to sign a contract by the end of the year. How will the prime minister ensure that bushfire victims like these ones can access the homebuilder scheme? <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison: </strong>Well, thank you, Mr Speaker. And I thank the member for her question, and I commend her for the work that she\u2019s done within her community, as I do all of those members who have been in bushfire-affected areas for the work that they\u2019ve done in engaging communities and raising issues that need to be addressed. </p> \n  <p>The commitment that we made to the states and territories was to jointly fund the demolition work that was being done across all of those buildings that were damaged and destroyed during the course of the bushfires. <br></p> \n  <p>The advice I have from the state government in NSW is that demolition work will be completed next month, but is already progressing through so many parts of the state. <br></p> \n  <p>That is the project which is managed, by the state government. They\u2019re running the contractors and they\u2019re doing it at a cracking pace and I commend them for doing that, and to keep pushing forward. The homebuilder program, as introduced by the housing minister and by the treasurer enables grants of $25,000 for those who are eligible under the income test rules to be able to support the construction of new homes. <br></p> \n  <p>And one of the key issues I\u2019ve been discussing with the state and territory premiers has been how we can escalate and more rapidly ensure that approvals are given, not just for these types of cases but more generally. The purpose is to bring it there and get the projects happening again. <br></p> \n  <p>But people in affected areas are eligible for the grants, subject of course to the income restrictions placed on those, and I\u2019ll be working closely with the states and territories to ensure that they can accelerate the rate of a home approval, not just in these areas but everywhere, because this is critical to job creation.

Are those requirements being observed for special purpose flights in and did you have to warn<strong> Alan Tudge </strong>and others that they weren\u2019t correctly social distancing on the most recent flight from Melbourne to Canberra?</p> \n  <p><strong>Murphy:</strong> social distancing is not possible in the same way in domestic flights. We have a domestic airline policy. Airlines, domestic airlines, certainly short-haul airlines, present quite a low risk of transmission because of their air handling. We have not seen a clear case of transmission of the virus on a domestic flight in Australia. So whilst initially the airlines were practising good distancing, they are now occupying their seats more fully, and I know that\u2019s one of the circumstances where we think it\u2019s not an unreasonable choice if someone chooses to wear a mask.</p> \n  <p> I certainly have not warned any politician about not practising social distancing. So airlines, and on the return flights from overseas, they have been at 80% occupancy, so we\u2019re trying to get a bit of gap. But you can\u2019t get the full 1.5-metre on a flight.

Its health policy, its youth policy, its suicide policy, its employment policy, its welfare policy; this is an incredibly complicated area and not all Indigenous experiences are the same. Indigenous Australians living in metropolitan areas have different life experiences to those living in regional and remote areas and so to suggest that there is one set of issues that applies to the Indigenous population is obviously ridiculous.</p> \n   <p>And we are aware of the heartbreaking stories within remote Indigenous communities, of abuse, sexual violence, of alcoholism, of drug abuse.

Delivery frequency in rural, regional and remote areas will not change. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed that wait times for letters will more than double, from three to seven days. <strong>This is not true.</strong> Mail speed standards for regular interstate letters (mail travelling around the country) have not changed. Whether measured in business days or actual days, the speed of delivery for intrastate mail has changed by only one or two days for regular intrastate letters, not out by four days as suggested.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed regional Australians and small business will be disadvantaged compared to metropolitan areas. <strong>This is not true.</strong> While the delivery frequency of regular mail has been adjusted in metropolitan areas, the delivery frequency for regular mail for rural, regional and remote areas was protected and remains unchanged. Licensed post offices \u2013 which, together with community postal agencies, represent about 2,300 small businesses in regional and rural communities \u2013 have come out in active support of the temporary regulatory changes.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed that vulnerable Australians will be most impacted by the changes. <strong>This is not true.</strong> The temporary regulatory changes give Australia Post flexibility to provide additional services that better support vulnerable Australians, such as delivering medicines and grocery boxes.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed that the changes are permanent. <strong>This is not true.</strong> The regulations are written such that changes will automatically end on 30 June 2021. The government will assess the effect of these temporary arrangements before the end of the year, and decide if they are to stay in place for the full period expected. Any extension of the temporary relief measures will be informed by relevant consultations. Such an extension would also be subject to a new disallowance period.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed that the government wants to privatise Australia Post. <strong>This is not true. </strong>The Morrison government is fully committed to Australia Post remaining in government ownership.

This includes practising good hand and respiratory hygiene, staying 1.5m away from other people, staying home when sick, and getting tested if they have cold or flu like symptoms.

You can feel it in the air. And some of it is racially charged. There\u2019s also a few other issues that we need to get to. Wayne Swan was on our show about half an hour ago saying Pete, Captain Cook statues and the like may be better placed in museums, what do you think?<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Dutton: </strong>Well, I think a museum would be a great place for Wayne Swan. I can\u2019t think of anyone more in the past than Wayne Swan. Really, is he serious? Look, I don\u2019t think ripping pages out of history books and brushing over parts of history that you don\u2019t agree with or that you don\u2019t like is really something that the Australian public is going to embrace. There are good and bad parts of our history. You learn from that. And sit down \u2013 and you see what Netflix has done and the ABC now is trying to do. I just think it is such an absurdity. You sit down with your kids, looking at some of these videos, explaining that slavery was a horrible period in the United States. There was a civil war that took place. Kids learn from all of that. But removing that sort of content from online or from our television sets, I just don\u2019t think makes any sense. People need to learn from history. Need to appreciate those periods. And people will reflect back on us in 100 years and no doubt form their own judgments as well. But I just really think airbrushing history or pretending that something didn\u2019t happen is such an obscure sort of leftwing cause. I don\u2019t think the mainstream public agree with it.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Q: </strong>Richard, you\u2019re left wing, have things gone too far?<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Dutton: </strong>He has got two left wings.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Marles: </strong>I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a leftwing cause. I think history matters. People need to be judged in the context of their history. And as Peter said, future generations are going to judge us. They are actually going to judge us on what we do or do not do in terms of dealing with the question of Indigenous disadvantage in this country. That\u2019s what we have got to be focusing on. I\u2019m not sure that we\u2019re going to be given a lot of credit for going on a statue rampage. We actually have to be doing something about improving the lives of Indigenous Australians right now and I think that\u2019s what should be our focus.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T00:48:52.795Z\">at 1.48am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee2c1438f0839df653844dc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T23:42:34.397Z\">12.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>For all the international coronavirus news, head here</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/12/coronavirus-live-news-markets-fall-over-fears-of-long-us-recovery-as-brazil-cases-top-800000\">Coronavirus live news: markets fall over fears of long US recovery as Brazil cases top 800,000</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee2be718f08969537f781c4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T23:35:47.180Z\">12.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Albanese on statues: 'You can't rewrite history, you have to learn from it'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Anthony Albanese </strong>called in to Sydney radio 2GB, where he was asked about what is apparently the biggest issue in Australia at the moment \u2013 the tearing down of statues.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>My position is very clear, which is that you can\u2019t rewrite history, you have to learn from it.

Singapore had been set for 20 September with Japan due to take place on 11 October.</p> <p>There is understood to be considerable interest from new venues in hosting meetings. F1 currently has eight races set to take place in Europe.</p> <p>Bahrain and Abu Dhabi are due to close out the calendar and Bahrain may host two races, using one of its alternative configurations. \u201cThere\u2019s a nice sort of almost oval track that would be quite exciting, and all the layouts have a grade one licence with the FIA, so that is an option,\u201d said Brawn. The remaining flyaway meetings in the mix to make up the schedule from the current calendar include Canada, Russia, China, USA, Mexico, Brazil and Vietnam.</p> <p> F1 is also discussing further races in Europe. \u201cThere are a number of good European tracks where we could add another one or two races on to make sure we have a comprehensive season,\u201d said Brawn. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to declare it yet, as it\u2019s still a work in progress.\u201d</p> <p>The Mugello circuit in Italy is reportedly in the frame to host a race, with MotoGP having recently withdrawn its meeting set to be held there. The track is owned by Ferrari who use it for testing and it holds a grade one FIA license. F1 has never raced there but when the sport held an in-season test at Mugello in 2012 it was highly praised by the drivers.

You can see <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM-amaGuVvw\">Royal Ballet dancers</a> rollicking to the Rolling Stones or a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=893614391065393\">choreographic chain letter</a> from San Francisco Ballet and New York City Ballet. However, sibling film-makers Alexander and Valentina Reneff-Olson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.reneffolsonproductions.com/shelter\">Shelter</a> goes one better, introducing the voices of dancers around the world (including Matthew Ball and Mayara Magri in London) reflecting on their time in isolation.</p> <h2>Dane Hurst\u2019s Moving Assembly Project</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvOYNrpoRXw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xvOYNrpoRXw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Ex-Rambert dancer Dane Hurst\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/movingassemblyproject/videos/?ref=page_internal\">Moving Assembly Project</a> bridges the UK and South Africa, and his Beyond Borders film compiles lockdown dances of all stripes from multiple continents in a spirit of international togetherness.

But French competition Blow Your Style adapted with an e-battle, dancers from around the world posting their clips to Instagram to be judged online. The kids\u2019 battles are brilliant, some of them just primary-aged, filmed on DIY garage dancefloors and in front of their mums\u2019 soft furnishings. Both the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CALp8IuIVb8/\">boys</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CALSNtfobjc/\">girls</a> are technically fierce and they leave most older opponents well and truly (home)schooled.</p> <h2>Swans for Relief</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/418674679\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/418674679?app_id=122963\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Back in April, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/apr/09/the-swan-birmingham-royal-ballet-lockdown\">Birmingham Royal Ballet\u2019s C\u00e9line Gittens danced The Dying Swan</a> at home, a poignant ray of light at the beginning of lockdown.

We are working with the Home Office to determine what must change so that this shameful period of our history is not repeated.</p> <p>\u201cThe impact of Covid-19 and the killing of George Floyd by US police officers has resulted in urgent calls for action to end the systemic and entrenched race inequalities that exist in our country. The law requires that all public bodies must promote inclusivity and opportunity by considering the impact their policies have on ethnic minorities.\u201d</p> <p>An alliance of 16 anti-racism groups called on the EHRC to launch an investigation into the extent of institutional racism within the Home Office in the wake of the publication of the Williams lessons learned review in March.</p> <p>Patrick Vernon, a campaigner on Windrush, welcomed the decision to launch an investigation. He has organised a <a href=\"https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/windrush-never-again\">petition</a>, so far signed by over 100,000 people, calling for the full implementation of all 30 recommendations set out in Williams review.

It is vital that the government immediately accepts Wendy Williams\u2019 recommendation for a full review and evaluation of the hostile environment policy and measures.\u201d</p> <p>Kimberly McIntosh, of the Runnymede Trust, said: \u201cWith the immigration bill making its way through parliament, it\u2019s time to tackle the longstanding injustices that permeate our immigration system. The government should implement the full set of recommendations made in the lessons learned review and end the hostile environment policies that wrought havoc on the lives of not just the Windrush generation, but countless others.\u201d</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: </p> <p>\u201cWe are carefully considering the findings of the Windrush Lessons Learned review and will respond shortly to those important recommendations.

I\u2019m not sure. This is another top-down initiative, not a deliberative response to local expressions of need,\u201d said Amy Hanser, associate professor in the department of sociology at the University of British Columbia, who focuses on inequality and urban China.</p> <p>In the days since Li\u2019s speech, authorities have started to limit public excitement. A directive from propaganda authorities told news outlets to delete content related to the <em>ditan</em> economy to avoid \u201chyping\u201d the topic. On the social-media platform Weibo, some hashtags related to the subject appeared to be blocked. Authorities in Beijing have already said that the capital is \u201cnot suitable\u201d for street vendors.</p> <p>That skittishness may be because a loosening of policies towards the vendors would be a rare example of social control being relaxed. For most of the last decade, cities such as Beijing have come under stricter regulation, from barring \u201cuncivilised behaviour\u201d \u2013 such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/06/chinese-citys-ban-on-beijing-bikinis-leaves-men-hot-under-collar\">\u201cBeijing bikini\u201d</a>, when men roll up their shirts in the summer \u2013 to efforts to rid the city of the so-called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/27/china-ruthless-campaign-evict-beijings-migrant-workers-condemned\">low-end population</a>\u201d of migrant workers.</p> <p>\u201cWe see Chinese society under more and more control. Everything becomes stricter, and suddenly we see some space,\u201d said Xu Jianhua, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Macau, who has researched street vending in Guangzhou. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s really about so many people excited about vending. It\u2019s an opportunity to see the relaxing of control.\u201d</p> <p>Xu sees the current support for street vendors as a temporary measure in response to Covid, not a real reversal of the government\u2019s apprehension about the informal economy and set ideas about cities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/blindsided-how-coronavirus-felled-the-global-economy-in-100-days\">Blindsided: how coronavirus felled the global economy in 100 days</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe overarching idea about what is modern, what is a good city, I don\u2019t think has changed,\u201d he said. \u201cModern means clean, orderly skyscrapers by big companies, and smarter cities.\u201d</p> <p>For Meng, the street stall business is also temporary. Beijing has not relaxed its policies towards vendors. As his partner quickly stir-fries rice noodles with egg, sauce and vegetables, he takes orders and serves up the food in small polystyrene bowls and a pair of disposable chopsticks.</p> <p>\u201cOur customers are very happy to see us. Some said they couldn\u2019t find any food even after a long walk. So it\u2019s very convenient,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But Meng does not plan on doing this forever. <em>Chengguan,</em> or municipal police, have a reputation for abusing, and sometimes beating, street vendors. The fines are also steep. \u201cRunning a stall, there is no stability. Even if you are not caught today, you might get caught tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Lillian Yang</em><br></p>"
