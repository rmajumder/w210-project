passengers on cancelled flights the option of a refund within 20 working days, via its website.</p> \n  <p>The airline has been forced to ground most of its fleet due to the pandemic, although it is still running a few <a href=\"https://www.ryanair.com/content/dam/ryanair/comms-2020/EN_20%20Apr%20Customer%20Notice%20-%20Covid19%20A4.pdf\">flights in and out of the UK</a>, mostly out of Dublin and Stansted.</p> \n  <p>Passengers were initially delighted, but a Ryanair email sent out on Monday, seen by the Guardian, has heralded an about-turn.</p> \n  <p>Instead of the refund, passengers have been sent a link telling them how told <a href=\"https://www.ryanair.com/ie/en/useful-info/refund-voucher\">how to use its vouchers</a> to purchase Ryanair flights and other services over the next 12 months.</p> \n  <p>Passengers can still request a cash refund, it states, but the request will be placed \u201cin the cash refund queue until the Covid-19 emergency has passed\u201d.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe highly recommend using the refund voucher as these are readily available and you can book flights on all Ryanair Group airlines in over 200 destinations,\u201d says the airline.</p> \n

all of the options set out under EU regulations, including refunds.\u201d</p> \n  <p>EU rules require the airlines to refund passengers on flights they cancel within seven days, but the airline industry across the board has ignored this over the last month, citing extraordinary circumstances.</p> \n  <p>EasyJet has since reintroduced the option of a cash refund online, while BA requires passengers to call the airline, which is near impossible at the moment.</p> \n  <p>The airlines can only offer credit vouchers with the consent of the passenger but this has not stopped the airlines and travel companies telling passengers, making this the only practical option. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T17:10:58.696Z\">at 6.10pm

publicly for Apple and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google\">Google</a> to weaken privacy protections around digital contact tracing, after its government admitted that its current plans would not work without changes to smartphone operating systems, <strong>Alex Hern</strong>, the Guardian\u2019s tech editor, reports.</p> \n  <p>The criticism comes two weeks after a landmark collaboration between the two companies to build technology enabling digital contact tracing apps, which would track contacts between users in an attempt to help slow the spread of Covid-19.</p> \n

Similar incidents were reported in areas of Strasbourg in eastern France.</p> \n  <p>This appears to be a spread of unrest following an incident in Villeneuve-la Garenne on Saturday evening in which a trail motorbike, ridden at speed by a man not wearing a helmet, hit the door of a police car stopped at a red traffic light.</p> \n  <p>An investigation is ongoing into the incident, which is the subject of conflicting claims: locals say officers opened the door of the unmarked police vehicle deliberately with the intention of injuring the rider, who was thrown from the bike and suffered a fractured femur. The man\u2019s family has announced it will sue the police, who deny the accusation its officers acted deliberately.</p> \n  <p>Seven people were arrested after the unrest on Sunday, which appears to have been sparked by rumours the injured man was so badly hurt he had his leg amputated; four were still in custody on Tuesday morning.</p> \n  <p>It has been reported in some UK media that the violence broke out because of French president Emmanuel Macron\u2019s decision to extend the country\u2019s strict lockdown until 11 May, but this seems unlikely as the extension was announced several days before the unrest began. However, tensions in the banlieues are especially high because of allegations of heavy-handed policing of the lockdown in the densely populated housing estates, which are home to many migrant and minority communities.</p> \n  <p>In Strasbourg, rubbish bins and a car were torched and Molotov cocktails were thrown at a police station. The local authorities said images posted on social media looked dramatic, but there was limited damage to the buildings.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T11:08:38.199Z\">at 12.08pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9ecdef8f08177aeb18acd7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T10:44:41.136Z\">11.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here\u2019s more on the decision to cancel this year\u2019s Oktoberfest in Bavaria, from the Guardian\u2019s correspondent in Germany, Kate Connolly.</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>Bavaria\u2019s leaders have cancelled Oktoberfest, the world\u2019s biggest beer festival, due to fears that it could become a breeding ground for the coronavirus.</p> \n   <p>The 210-year-old festival, which attracts around six million visitors a year, is a major event in the German calendar.</p> \n   <p>Markus S\u00f6der, the premier of Bavaria, which has been one of the regions worst hit by the pandemic in Europe, said the Oktoberfest posed too big a public health risk.

Prof Lars Schaade, the RKI\u2019s vice-president, said: \u201cWe must systematically examine all the evidence, including through autopsies.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He said the decision to relax restrictions across Germany, which has seen some small shops opening, and pupils returning to school to sit exams this week, were \u201csensible\u201d from a societal point of view. But from a purely epidemiological viewpoint restrictions should remain in place. </p> \n  <p>The main aim remained ensuring the number of cases remained in a \u201csafe zone\u201d, he said. Germany\u2019s reproduction rate is 0.9 \u2013 up on Friday when it was 0.7 \u2013 which means every person contracting the illness is infecting a further person. The number of new cases are doubling every 20 days, the number of deaths every 12 days.</p> \n  <p>According to health authority figures this morning, Germany has more than 147,000 confirmed cases, and 4,912 people have died from the disease. Germany\u2019s mortality rate from coronavirus is at 3.2%. Schaade said it had risen, as the amount of infections and subsequent deaths in care homes and hospitals had increased.</p> \n  <p>He said test capacity was at 730,000 a week in Germany, but should ideally be around 1m, with everyone who has a respiratory illness or infection of the airway getting tested. However, he pointed to practical problems with upscaling testing due to a global lack of reagents.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"726dcf73d95a51741075c6cd4fec749c07b7dc70\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/726dcf73d95a51741075c6cd4fec749c07b7dc70/0_177_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lars Schaade, vice- president of the Robert-Koch-Institute.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lars Schaade, vice- president of the Robert-Koch-Institute.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bernd von Jutrczenka/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Despite reports this morning that children are not spreading the disease as much as had been thought, Schaade said intensive tracking showed children who had contracted the disease in Germany were found to have as much of the virus in their throats as adults, even if they often show no symptoms. He said the RKI believed children played a not-insignificant role in spreading the disease.</p> \n  <p>Schaade said advice about stopping the spread of the virus remained the same, and would do so as long as there was no vaccination: keep a distance of 1.5 metres, cough into the elbow and wash your hands. He advised the wearing of face protection that covered the nose and mouth in public places.</p> \n  <p>He said intensive tracking of those who had been in contact with infected people remained an important part of the strategy to tackle coronavirus, and was a \u201cclassical epidemiological tool\u201d, enabling contacts to be \u201cfound and isolated so that they don\u2019t infect more people\u201d.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T10:37:00.485Z\">at 11.37am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9ec0c28f0895b8b228360c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T09:54:31.972Z\">10.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Singapore lockdown extended until 1 June</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Singapore\u2019s prime minister Lee Hsien Loong has extended a lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus by four weeks until 1 June, after the city-state saw a sharp rise in cases.</p> \n  <p>The measures, which include the closures of most workplaces and schools, were initially set to run from 7 April until 4 May.</p> \n  <p>You can read the prime minister\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-pm-lee-full-speech-circuit-breaker-extended-june-1-12662056\">full speech here</a>.

  "<p>Netflix has more than doubled the number of new subscribers it expected in the last three months as more people signed up amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>The streaming giant announced on Tuesday that it added 15.77 million new paid subscribers globally, well above the 7 million it had expected, as people worldwide sought ways to entertain themselves during the lockdowns.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/16/netflix-now-worth-more-than-exxonmobil-as-value-reaches-187bn\">Netflix now worth more than ExxonMobil as value reaches $196bn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The boost led to huge audiences for the service\u2019s hit shows. About 64 million subscribers watched Netflix\u2019s Tiger King documentary as much of the world went into lockdown to avoid the pandemic. Other hits included the reality show Love Is Blind, which attracted 30 million subscribers in the last three months, and its original film Spenser Confidential (85 million).</p> <p>The company acknowledged that the huge surge in membership and audience was probably temporary.</p> <p>\u201cIn our 20+ year history, we have never seen a future more uncertain or unsettling. The coronavirus has reached every corner of the world and, in the absence of a widespread treatment or vaccine, no one knows how or when this terrible crisis will end,\u201d the company said in a statement.</p> <p>\u201cAt Netflix, we\u2019re acutely aware that we are fortunate to have a service that is even more meaningful to people confined at home, and which we can operate remotely with minimal disruption in the short to medium term. Like other home entertainment services, we\u2019re seeing temporarily higher viewing and increased membership growth.\u201d</p> <p>Mihir Haria Shah, head of broadcast at Total Media, said the long-term impact of the coronavirus on Netflix\u2019s business remained to be seen.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no doubt that Netflix has been helped by the viral sensation that is Tiger King and also new seasons of Narcos Mexico, Ozark and Money Heist \u2013 which are all Netflix originals favourites. The challenge in continuing to grow and also preventing churn is likely to be how long they can sustain dripping in new series with production studios shut for the foreseeable future,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Netflix, like many other studios and networks, has shut down production on original content since 13 March.

  "<p>Dozens of homeless people are sleeping at Heathrow airport after being denied emergency accommodation by councils despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/ministers-asking-english-councils-to-house-all-rough-sleepers-says-charity\">promises</a> from the government that all would be taken off the streets during the coronavirus pandemic, it has emerged.</p> <p>Since the Covid-19 lockdown began, one of the rough sleepers, a professional woman in her 40s from west Africa who is trying to regularise her immigration status, said that the number in Terminal 5 had more than doubled. She said the rough sleepers were a mix of migrants and British citizens.</p> <p>\u201cI first started sleeping at the airport last October when I lost my accommodation,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were 10-15 of us then. Now we have grown to about 30. We try to support each other by sharing food and things. We have approached different councils asking them to give us accommodation, just until the pandemic is over, but they have refused so we\u2019re still sleeping at the airport.\u201d</p> <p>Hillingdon council is the closest local authority to Heathrow and some of the rough sleepers said they approached officials there for emergency accommodation during the pandemic but were turned away. A letter from the council\u2019s chief executive, Fran Beasley, dated 16 April, states: \u201cI can confirm that Hillingdon council has taken all necessary steps in assisting known rough sleepers as required and remains fully compliant with government requirements.\u201d</p> <p>This was written in response to a letter from several organisations <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/16/homeless-migrants-still-sleeping-rough-despite-pms-pledge-say-charities\">expressing concern</a> about the failure to help homeless people get off the streets during the pandemic regardless of their immigration status.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/thousands-of-rough-sleepers-still-unhoused-in-england-say-charities\">Thousands of rough sleepers still unhoused in England, say charities</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe airport staff are kind to us as long as we behave ourselves,\u201d said the woman sleeping at Terminal 5. \u201cWhen the virus started the numbers sleeping at the airport grew and I started seeing a lot of unfamiliar faces. It is much safer here than sleeping outside. London is scary at the moment because it\u2019s so empty.\u201d</p> <p>She said that she had approached several London boroughs including Hillingdon but had been denied accommodation. \u201cIf they can\u2019t help us, they should let us stay at the airport,\u201d she said. \u201cThe people sleeping here are very calm. They are not using drugs or alcohol. Some of us sleep on the floor. Some on the chairs. There are social distancing notices everywhere and we comply with them.\u201d</p> <p>A bulletin published on Tuesday from councils about support for migrants with no recourse to public funds during the pandemic says: \u201cProviding additional support for residents is extremely challenging for councils and it is unclear to what extent the government\u2019s Covid-19 emergency funding will adequately meet these costs.</p> <p>\u201cA consequence of the Home Office not relaxing restrictions on access to benefits during the pandemic for people subject to the \u2018no recourse to public funds\u2019 condition is that local government is likely to incur additional costs when accommodation and financial support needs to be provided.\u201d</p> <p>Fizza Qureshi, chief executive of the Migrants\u2019 Rights Network, expressed concerns about physical distancing in inadequate spaces. She said: \u201cWe are extremely concerned that there are homeless people who are having to shelter in the airport because they have been turned away by local authorities ... The only thing that is heartwarming is that they are building their own community to lean on during this crisis.\u201d</p> <p>A Heathrow spokesperson said: \u201cIn line with government guidelines, Heathrow is applying the necessary social distancing measures at our airport, which sees us strictly limiting airport access to passengers, colleagues and those with a reason for entry. We are asking all other members of the public to leave to ensure their safety and the safety of others. All new arrivals at the airport who are struggling to find accommodation will be asked to return to their point of origin and contact StreetLink for support.\u201d</p> <p>Hillingdon council said: \u201cThe Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government is leading on rehousing the rough sleepers based at Heathrow airport. We have offered accommodation to all of the rough sleepers in other parts of the borough who we are in contact with.\u201d</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: \u201cOver 90% of those known to be living on the streets at the start of the crisis have been offered safe accommodation - ensuring some of the most vulnerable people can stay safe during the pandemic. This remarkable achievement is the result of a collaborative effort across government and with local authorities, health providers and charities.</p> <p>\u201cThis is backed by \u00a33.2bn of government funding for local authorities as part of the wider government response to the coronavirus pandemic.\u201d</p>",

In normal times, reaching this stage would take years and I\u2019m very proud of the work taken so far.</p> \n   <p>At the same time, we will invest in manufacturing capability so that if either of these vaccines safely work, we can make it available for the British people as soon as humanely possible.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Hancock also announced that the Oxford University project will get \u00a320m to fund its trials.

He went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>After all, the upside of being the first country in the world to develop a successful vaccine is so huge that I am throwing everything at it.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hancock dismissed a claim from the most senior official at the Foreign Office that the government took a political decision not to participate in an EU-wide ventilator procurement scheme.</strong> Asked about <strong>Sir Simon McDonald</strong>\u2019s comment (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/21/uk-coronavirus-live-parliament-returns-government-lockdown-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e9f0e288f0826d9592b5e7e#block-5e9f0e288f0826d9592b5e7e\">4.17pm)</a>, Hancock said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I haven\u2019t seen that exchange but I have spoken to the foreign secretary and as far as I\u2019m aware there was no political decision not to participate in that scheme.</p> \n   <p>We did receive an invitation in the Department of Health and it was put up to me to be asked and we joined so we are now members of that scheme.</p> \n   <p>However, as far as I know that scheme hasn\u2019t [provided] a single item of PPE [personal protective equipment].</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Although Hancock\u2019s comment sounded like a robust denial, it was less than watertight because Hancock just said he was \u201cnot aware\u201d of any political decision to boycott the scheme and he then conflated the EU ventilator procurement scheme with a separate one covering PPE (although, as <strong>Jennifer Rankin </strong>wrote when she first reported on this in March, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/24/uk-coronavirus-live-news-lockdown-boris-johnson-sports-direct-abandons-talk-of-opening-stores-as-gove-clarifies-scope-of-lockdown-rules?page=with:block-5e7a305f8f085e31106fe923#block-5e7a305f8f085e31106fe923\">the original UK decision not to get involved covered all the various EU coronavirus procurement schemes.)</a></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, hinted that the government is not about to change its policy on members of the public wearing masks.</strong> The government\u2019s scientific advisory group for emergencies, Sage, discussed this today, but no new recommendations have gone to ministers yet. Van-Tam said the advice would change if the evidence justified that. But he went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There is an absolutely enduring principle here that Sage places great value and prime importance on never jeopardising the supplies of PPE to our health and social care workers. That is a line that we are not going to cross.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hancock said the government would start testing NHS staff who do not have coronavirus symptoms. </strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Van-Tam said the \u201cvast majority\u201d of coronavirus was being spread by people with symptoms. </strong>But there was also likely to be some spread from symptomatic or pre-symptomatic people, he said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hancock said the government was working with 159 UK manufacturers who may be able to make PPE for the NHS.</strong> But not all offers were credible, he said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have had to make sure we sort out the creditable offers from those that are not.</p> \n   <p>We have had some offers, for instance, that have come from companies where, upon investigation, the company has only just been formed in the previous day or two before coming and asking for a cash deal with the government.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Van-Tam said the UK is not yet seeing a significant downturn in new cases. </strong>he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It isn\u2019t clear there is an enormous downturn at this point.

Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Boris Johnson will speak to President Trump later today, in a sign that he is starting to resume some of his duties as prime minister.</strong> He is also due to have a telephone audience with the Queen later this week. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman, as he announced that the calls would take place, refused to accept that this meant the PM was getting back to work. The PM was still recovering, the spokesman said. But he said that the call with Trump, although partly a thank you call for the message of support Trump sent when Johnson was ill, would also involve an update from Trump about what the G7 is doing to address the coronavirus crisis. (The US holds the presidency of the G7.) The spokesman also said that yesterday Johnson sent a message of condolence to Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, in relation to the shootings in Nova Scotia.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, will chair a cabinet meeting on Thursday, the spokesman said. </strong>He will also take PMQs on Wednesday.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman rejected a report claiming No 10 does not support Matt Hancock\u2019s target of getting the number of coronavirus tests carried out each day up to 100,000 by the end of this month.</strong> The Daily Telegraph makes this claim, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/04/20/matt-hancocks-pledge-test-100000-people-day-coronavirus-arbitrary/\">in a story (paywall)</a> starting: \u201cThe health secretary\u2019s promise that 100,000 people a day would be tested for coronavirus has been criticised as \u201carbitrary\u201d and \u201cirrational\u201d by Downing Street sources.\u201d The story goes on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The Downing Street source said: \u201cThe problem is with this arbitrary target. There is a faint irrationality behind it, just because there was a clamour for mass testing. Hancock\u2019s 100,000 target was a response to criticism in the media, and he decided to crank out tests regardless.</p> \n   <p>\u201cHancock\u2019s not had a good crisis. The prime minister will say he has confidence in him, but it doesn\u2019t feel like that. He set out to buy time by setting this target, and it threatens to come back to bite him. The 100,000 figure was Hancock\u2019s idea \u2013 but he made that figure up.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked about the story, the spokesman said that the source quoted by the Telegraph was \u201cwrong\u201d. He said 100,000 tests a day was a government target and the government was working to achieve it.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hancock will take the press conference this afternoon, the spokesman said. </strong>He will be accompanied by <strong>Prof Jonathan Van-Tam</strong>, the deputy chief medical<strong> </strong>officer for England.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said the government now has the capacity to test more than 39,000 people for coronavirus every day. </strong>But the latest daily testing figure, for the number of tests carried out in the 24 hours up to 9am yesterday, was 19,306. The spokesman said that in total 97,000 NHS and care workers and their relatives have now been tested.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said the government wanted to open 50 drive-through testing centres open by the end of the month.</strong> There are 27 open now, he said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman confirmed that Sage, the scientific advisory group for emergencies, is meeting today to discuss its advice on face masks.</strong> Sage is holding another meeting on Thursday. The spokesman was unable to say when Sage would come to a decision. When it was in a position to offer advice to the government, it would do so, he said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman signalled that the government agrees with those NHS bosses who have warned that making the public wear face masks could result in fewer being available for the NHS</strong>. As <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/facemasks-for-public-risk-nhs-shortage-q5bkzvzql\">the Times (paywall)</a> reports, <strong>Chris Hopson</strong>, chief executive of the hospitals group NHS Providers, has said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If the government is going to consider advising the general public to wear facemasks it must fully assess the impact on the NHS. Fluid repellent masks for health and care staff are key to safety and to avoid the spread of coronavirus.</p> \n   <p>Securing the supply of masks, when there is huge global demand, is crucial. This must be a key consideration. There needs to be clear evidence that wearing masks, along with other measures, will deliver significant enough benefits to take us out of lockdown to potentially jeopardise NHS mask supply.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked if the government agreed with this, the spokesman said that Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, recently said that if there were a conflict between NHS staff needing mask and members of the public wanting them, NHS staff should take priority.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Downing Street has not agreed to the TUC\u2019s call for a judge-led inquiry into PPE shortages, the spokesman indicated. </strong><a href=\"https://www.tuc.org.uk/news/public-inquiry-needed-over-grotesque-failure-planning-ppe-says-tuc\">The TUC wants the inquiry to start by the end of this year.</a> Asked about the TUC proposal, the spokesman did not say that the government was adopting it. But he did say that Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, made it clear at the weekend that where there were lessons to learn from what had happened, the government would seek to learn them.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman rejected claims that the UK was dependent on the consignment of PPE due to arrive from Turkey.</strong> There were many more orders for PPE in the pipeline, the spokesman said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"409c15b67505d18d5f64dd20813c5b4b0c5758c0\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/409c15b67505d18d5f64dd20813c5b4b0c5758c0/1389_285_2607_1564/1000.jpg\" alt=\"10 Downing Street.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">10 Downing Street.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T16:29:20.323Z\">at 5.29pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9edd108f08cd080212f819\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T11:52:27.945Z\">12.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Scotland records 70 new deaths from Covid-19, taking total to 985</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A total of 985 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus, up by 70 from 915 on Monday, Nicola Sturgeon has said.

Here are the key points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Stripe said that the ONS death figures released this morning for England and Wales for the week ending 10 April were almost certainly an understatement. </strong>He said 10 April, was Good Friday, and only around a third of registration offices were open. He went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>So actually that number is slightly deflated because if the registration offices had been open, maybe another couple of thousand, if not more, deaths would have been registered.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the ONS figures that were published showed around 8,000 \u201cexcess deaths\u201d in the week ending 10 April.</strong> That meant deaths above the five-year average. Of those, only 80% were directly related to coronavirus, he said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Compared to the five-year average of the same week in the year, it\u2019s 8,000 deaths above that average, of which 6,200 - about 80% of of those deaths - involved Covid.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the ONS was carrying out a research project to establish what was responsible for the other 20% of excess deaths. </strong>They might be related to coronavirus, he said, or they might be related to people not going to hospital. He said fully establishing the reasons for these excess deaths might take months or even years.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that the the ONS\u2019s figures for the Friday up to 10 April were 40% higher than the numbers that were officially announced by the government for coronavirus deaths the following day. </strong>And the ONS figures were about 20% higher than the latest figures for NHS England (which is now publishing figures showing how many people are known to have died from coronavirus in hospital on any particular day).</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said only around 80% of coronavirus deaths were in a hospital.</strong> In the previous week that figure was 90%, he said. He said 13% of coronavirus deaths were in a care home, and 5% were in a private home. In the previous week there were 217 coronavirus deaths in care homes. In the week up to 10 April there were just over 1,000.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the number of deaths in care homes, from all causes, was double in the week up to 10 April what it was two weeks previously. </strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that around one in three of the death in the week ending 10 April involved coronavirus</strong>.

  "<p>Set in an Elizabethan England haunted by the threat of plague, Maggie O\u2019Farrell\u2019s unexpectedly timely novel about the death of Shakespeare\u2019s son, Hamnet, will go up against Hilary Mantel\u2019s The Mirror and the Light for this year\u2019s Women\u2019s prize for fiction.</p> <p>The novels, which are among the biggest books of 2020, lead a heavyweight shortlist that will compete this autumn for the \u00a330,000 prize.

There were a lot of extremely impressive books on the longlist. It was difficult. We\u2019re all still friends but I\u2019m not going to pretend, it was tense. We weren\u2019t fighting, but passions were high \u2013 just as you would want in such a process.\u201d</p> <p>Longlisted books that didn\u2019t make the cut include Ann Patchett\u2019s The Dutch House, Jacqueline Woodson\u2019s Red at the Bone, and Edna O\u2019Brien\u2019s Girl. </p> <p>Hamnet, an account of the short life of Shakespeare\u2019s son, who died at the age of 11, and the effect of his death on his mother, is \u201cextraordinary\u201d, said Lane Fox, who also called The Mirror and the Light, the bestselling conclusion to Mantel\u2019s trilogy about the life of Thomas Cromwell, phenomenal. Mantel, who won the Booker twice for the two previous instalments, Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies, has been shortlisted three times for the Women\u2019s prize but never won.</p> <p>\u201cIf Mantel puts you through this whirlwind of history, in prose which is so perfectly in the moment, so clearly and simply drawn, what O\u2019Farrell did in her book made me think about how women moved through space and place in a way that was really quite wonderful,\u201d said Lane Fox. \u201cI felt like I was in those corridors and rooms with her characters in a way that I haven\u2019t felt in a novel before.\u201d</p> <p>Hamnet opens as its title character tries to find help for his twin sister Judith, who is lying in bed with what is feared to be plague. At the thought of lumps forming beneath her skin, \u201ca cold fear rinses down through his chest, encasing his heart\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite on the money in terms of the harrowing experiences we\u2019re currently going through,\u201d said Lane Fox.</p> <p>All of the books, she said, draw from \u201cbig, chunky\u201d experiences: \u201cidentity, gender relationships, power, war, grief, the climate crisis, slavery, immigration\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThese writers are not shying away from the topics we\u2019re all facing over the next decade,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are all living in challenging, sad and complex times, so incredible stories provide hope, a moment of escape and a point of connection now more than ever \u2026 We are all so proud of these books \u2013 all readers will find solace if they pick one up.\u201d</p> <p>The Women\u2019s prize is intended to reward \u201cexcellence, originality and accessibility in writing by women in English from throughout the world\u201d. It is marking its 25th anniversary this year with a new digital book club, #ReadingWomen, which will tackle each previous winner, from Helen Dunmore\u2019s A Spell of Winter, which won in 1996, to An American Marriage by Tayari Jones, which won last year. A public vote this autumn will choose the \u201cwinner of winners\u201d.</p> <p>Lane Fox was joined on the judging panel by writer and activist Scarlett Curtis, co-founder of the Black British Business Awards Melanie Eusebe, author and comedian Viv Groskop and author Paula Hawkins.</p> <p>This year\u2019s winner\u2019s ceremony has been postponed from June until 9 September due to the coronavirus.</p>",
  "<p>Spanish police have arrested a former British rapper turned Islamic State extremist, Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, one of the most wanted militants in Europe, in a counter-terrorism swoop on Tuesday.</p> <p>British and other sources confirmed his identity a few hours after the national police agency in Madrid said it had arrested an Egyptian national and two other men in a flat in the southern Spanish city of Almeria.</p> <p>Originally from Maida Vale in London, Bary was a joint British-Egyptian national but he was stripped of his UK citizenship because of his links to the terror group. Once considered a notorious Isis figure, he had disappeared from view in recent years.</p> <p>One source said he had been arrested shortly after entering Spain from Algeria, but this could not immediately be confirmed.</p> <p>A video posted by the Spanish national police showed three men being led away from a flat with their faces covered. A police statement described one of the men arrested as among the most wanted Isis fighters in Europe.</p> <p>Bary, 29, is the son of Adel Abdel Bary, who was convicted of US embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 213 people. The younger Abdel Bary was a vocal supporter of Isis from 2013 to 2015. In that time he posed with a severed head and frequently menaced the west in social media posts.</p> <p>There was speculation at the time that he could be the hooded militant nicknamed Jihadi John, who beheaded a number of western hostages on camera. However, that person was later revealed to be Mohammed Emwazi. Abdel Bary knew Emwazi \u2013 and four other men branded by their captors as the Beatles \u2013 through west London Islamic circles, but he is not thought to have worked closely with them in Syria.</p> <p> Abdel Bary disappeared for years, leading to speculation that he had been killed as the group\u2019s so-called caliphate crumbled from late 2015. </p> <p>Turkish police, whom British officials had asked to hunt for Abdel Bary, said they lost track of him by late 2015. There were suspicions he had used the then highly active migrant route to smuggle himself to central Europe via Greece.</p> <p>Abdel Bary is thought to have had a Spanish girlfriend whom he met online sometime in 2017. By then he is believed to have resumed an online presence using numerous aliases.</p> <p>During a brief career as a rapper in London he was known as Lyricist Jinn and L Jinny, and he performed with a group called the Black Triangle. After immersing in his faith, he denounced his former life and friends. He left his family and five siblings for the Isis stronghold of Raqqa in July 2013.</p> <p>A Home Office official said there was nothing to add to the Spanish statement. </p>",
  "<p>As the first universal credit (UC) payments start to come through for the tens of thousands of families who have had to claim it because of Covid-19, they will discover that there is no support in UC for their third or subsequent child if that child was born after April 2017, when the \u201ctwo-child limit\u201d policy came into effect. Only that child\u2019s older siblings will be eligible for child allowances in UC to meet their needs.</p> <p>The government\u2019s rationale for the policy is that parents claiming UC or tax credits should face the same choices about the number of children they can afford as those supporting themselves solely through work. But the current national crisis has exposed that argument as untenable. Even in normal times, no parent can be sure that their financial security will withstand unpredictable events such as illness, bereavement or redundancy. Certainly no parent could have had foresight of Covid-19, and so planned their family size accordingly.</p> <p>Yet families newly affected by the two-child limit are being left with too little to meet their needs in circumstances entirely beyond their control. That is not right. The policy should be lifted before struggle turns to real hardship for the many affected families.</p> <p>Similarly, the benefit cap \u2013 which limits the total amount of benefits per household \u2013 can have no place during the current crisis. Some parents are newly subject to the cap because their working hours have been cut, so they can no longer reach the earnings threshold at which they are exempted from the cap. Others won\u2019t benefit from the government\u2019s welcome increases in universal credit, tax credits and the local housing allowance because these increases mean they are hit by the cap. In neither case can most parents simply find a job (if one was available) or work more to escape being capped, given school closures, reduced childcare provision and social distancing.</p> <p>The pandemic has exposed the benefit cap and two-child limit as inherently arbitrary, when what is needed \u2013 during the pandemic and beyond \u2013 is a safety net that is strong, compassionate and just. We urge ministers to lift the policies now.</p> <p><strong>Alison Garnham</strong> <em>Chief executive, Child Poverty Action Group</em><br><strong>Rt Rev Paul Butler</strong> <em>Bishop of Durham</em><br><strong>Danny Sriskandarajah</strong> <em>Chief executive, Oxfam GB</em><br><strong>Marie van der Zyl</strong> <em>President, Board of Deputies of British Jews</em><br><strong>Anna Feuchtwang</strong> <em>Chair, End Child Poverty Coalition</em> <br><strong>Harun Khan</strong> <em>Secretary general, Muslim Council of Britain</em><br><strong>Imran Hussain</strong> <em>Director of policy and campaigns, Action for Children</em><br><strong>Kate Bell</strong> <em>Head of rights, international, social and economics, the TUC</em><br><strong>Tim Roache</strong> <em>General secretary, GMB</em><br><strong>Sandra Horley</strong> <em>Chief executive, Refuge</em><br><strong>Dominic Williams</strong> <em>CEO, Frontline Debt Advice</em><br><strong>Nicki Norman</strong> <em>Acting chief executive, Women\u2019s Aid Federation of England</em><br><strong>Edwin Shuker</strong> <em>Vice president, Board of Deputies of British Jews</em><br><strong>Paddy Lillis</strong> <em>General secretary, Usdaw</em><br><strong>Mary-Ann Stephenson</strong> <em>Director, Women\u2019s Budget Group</em><br><strong>Ann Furedi</strong> <em>Chief executive, British Pregnancy Advisory Service</em><br><strong>Joseph Howes</strong> <em>Chief executive officer, Buttle UK</em><br><strong>Laurence Guinness</strong> <em>Chief executive, The Childhood Trust</em><br><strong>Paula Stringer</strong> <em>UK chief executive, Christians Against Poverty (CAP)</em><br><strong>Thomas Lawson</strong> <em>CEO, Turn2us</em><br><strong>Bill Scott</strong> <em>Chair, Poverty &amp; Inequality Commission for Scotland</em><br><strong>Graham Whitham</strong> <em>Director, Greater Manchester Poverty Action</em><br><strong>Sabine Goodwin</strong> <em>Coordinator, Independent Food Aid Network</em><br><strong>Martin Charlesworth</strong> <em>Chief executive, Jubilee+</em><br><strong>Jane Malcolm</strong> <em>CEO, Level Trust</em><br><strong>Prof Clive Marsh</strong> <em>Vice-president, the Methodist Conference</em> <br><strong>Rev Dr Barbara Glasson</strong> <em>President, the Methodist Conference</em> <br><strong>Dr Nick Owen</strong> <em>Chief executive officer, The Mighty Creatives</em><br><strong>Dr Mary Bousted and Kevin Courtney</strong> <em>Joint general secretaries, the National Education Union</em><br><strong>Craig Samuel</strong> <em>Scotland representative, NAWRA</em><br><strong>Jane Streather</strong> <em>Chair, North East Child Poverty Commission</em> <br><strong>Satwat Rehman</strong> <em>CEO, One Parent Families Scotland</em> <br><strong>Maurice Wren</strong> <em>Chief executive, the Refugee Council</em> <br><strong>Very Rev Dr Susan Brown</strong> <em>Convener of the Faith Impact Forum, the Church of Scotland</em> <br><strong>Tony Edwards</strong> <em>Acting CEO, Church Urban Fund</em> <br><strong>Dr Nicola Sharp-Jeffs</strong> <em>CEO, Surviving Economic Abuse (SEA)</em> <br><strong>Derek Estill</strong> <em>Moderator of the General Assembly, the United Reformed Church</em> <br><strong>Rev Nigel Uden</strong> <em>Moderator of the General Assembly, the United Reformed Church</em> <br><strong>Ann Furedi</strong> <em>Chief executive, British Pregnancy Advisory Service</em> <br><strong>Jane van Zyl</strong> <em>Chief executive, Working Families</em> <br><strong>Irene Audain</strong> <em>Chief executive, Scottish Out of School Care Network</em> <br><strong>Dr Wanda Wyporska</strong> <em>Executive director, The Equality Trust</em> <br><strong>Raji Hunjan</strong> <em>Chief executive, Z2K</em> <br><strong>Ruth Erblich</strong> <em>Welfare Benefits Advice Office, Agudas Israel Community Service</em> <br><strong>Rev David Mayne</strong> <em>Moderator, the Baptist Union Council</em> <br><strong>Shaben Begum</strong> <em>Director, Scottish Independent Advocacy Alliance</em> <br><strong>Thomas Croft and Diana Skelton</strong> <em>ATD Fourth World</em><br><strong>Dr C Quinn</strong><em> Rape Crisis England &amp; Wales</em></p>",

Similar moves by Trump in the past have triggered mayhem at airports in America and beyond as well as legal challenges. Such an order would be a far-reaching use of executive power from a president who last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/trump-us-coronavirus-briefing-latest-media\">claimed he had \u201ctotal\u201d authority over states\u2019 efforts</a> to reopen their economies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/18/the-virus-doesnt-discriminate-but-governments-do-latinos-disproportionately-hit-by-coronavirus\">'The virus doesn't discriminate but governments do': Latinos disproportionately hit by coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p> </p> <p>Trump\u2019s tweet about suspending immigration was curiously timed on a day in which he claimed many areas hardest hit by the virus had \u201cturned the corner\u201d and as he actively foments protests against the lockdown. On Tuesday White House officials offered competing justifications for the measure.</p> <p>Robert O\u2019Brien, the national security adviser, told the Fox News channel: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to do everything, the president\u2019s trying to do everything he can to put the health of the American people first during this crisis. So this is one step. It\u2019s not dissimilar to the restrictions on travel from China that he implemented back on January 29 at the very outset of this public health crisis.\u201d</p> <p>But with more than 22 million people filing for unemployment aid in recent weeks, the White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, put the emphasis on jobs: \u201cAs President Trump has said, \u2018Decades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for African-American and Latino workers.\u2019 At a time when Americans are looking to get back to work, action is necessary.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s tweet did not make clear which immigration programmes might be affected. Nearly all visa processing by the state department, including immigrant visas, has been on hold during the pandemic. Asylum claims have also been suspended in effect, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/us-asylum-seekers-coronavirus-law-un\">thousands of people being swiftly returned to Mexico without due process</a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/04/09/us/ap-us-virus-outbreak-border-enforcement.html\">,</a> which the UN has described as a violation of international and US law.</p> <p>The abrupt move provoked fierce criticism from immigration rights groups. Andrea Flores, deputy policy director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s equality division, said: \u201cUnfortunately, President Trump seems more interested in fanning anti-immigrant flames than in saving lives. We cannot allow President Trump to exploit this pandemic to advance his racism and xenophobia.\u201d</p> <p>Democrats suggested the president was seeking to distract from his own mishandling of the pandemic. Congressman Don Beyer of Virginia tweeted: \u201cFrom the beginning Trump has flailed about seeking someone to blame for his own failure. Obama. Governors. China. Speaker Pelosi. People of Asian descent.</p> <p>\u201cImmigration has nearly stopped and the US has far more cases than any other country. This is just xenophobic scapegoating.\u201d</p> <p>Congressman Joaqu\u00edn Castro of Texas, the chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, added: \u201cThis action is not only an attempt to divert attention away from Trump\u2019s failure to stop the spread of the coronavirus and save lives, but an authoritarian-like move to take advantage of a crisis and advance his anti-immigrant agenda. We must come together to reject his division.\u201d</p> <p>Moe Vela, a former senior adviser on Latino affairs to the then vice-president Joe Biden, said: \u201cHe wants to distract again. He castigates and casts blame as he tries to take it away from himself. He shirked his most fundamental responsibility as the president of this nation and that\u2019s to keep us safe.

For example, one day one half of the pupils, the other day the other half. The starting date for all schools and day cares is 11 May,\u201d Rutte said. Advisers will take into account data from Scandinavian countries, including Denmark, which last week reopened primary schools, and Norway, which did so on Monday.</p> \n<p>Secondary schools in the Netherlands could resume a month later if no outbreaks occurred in the intervening period in primary schools, they said. They also suggested that children up to the age of 12 could exercise without social distancing, but that the rules should be enforced for older pupils.</p> \n<p>Dutch-style phased reopening offers a model for other European countries which have so far not significantly eased lockdown measures or allowed pupils back to school. They include Italy, Spain and the UK, all of which have had high rates of infection and transmission.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday, the Spanish government announced that children under 14 would be allowed out of their homes from 27 April if accompanied by a parent. They are not permitted to exercise or play in parks, which remain shut, but they can visit the supermarket, chemist or bank.</p> \n<p>The trend across Europe is of a cautious return to pre-virus life.

However, analysis by the New York Times of death records in Istanbul showed that the city had had a jump of 2,100 more deaths than expected in a recent four-week period, suggesting the spread of the coronavirus could be much worse than officials say.</p> \n<p>In Singapore, the prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, extended a lockdown by four weeks, until 1 June, after the city-state recorded a sharp rise in cases.</p> \n<p>Singapore instituted a successful contact tracing system for its general population.

I\u2019m heartbroken audiences won\u2019t get to experience the final version on the Pels stage,\u201d she wrote to me last week. \u201cBut this moment is all about adapting to things we haven\u2019t anticipated.\u201d</p> <p>Bettis, who grew up all over, \u201clike seven different states\u201d, she said, now lives in Brooklyn, with her husband, the actor Bobby Moreno, one of the stars of 72 Miles. \u201cTrying to live together and work together, it\u2019s been really complicated,\u201d she said. \u201cYou always go in thinking, like, \u2018Oh no, we can totally do it and not bring the play home.\u2019 And then cut to, like, 3am and we\u2019re like crying and yelling at each other, trying to figure out why a scene doesn\u2019t work.\u201d She is pregnant with their first child, due in May.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgE2De7gK1I\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PgE2De7gK1I?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>In 72 Miles, set in Tucson, Arizona, and just over the border in Nogales, Mexico, Anita, a Mexican woman who entered America without documentation and married an American man, has been deported. Her children, including Christian (Moreno), also undocumented, hope that she will return home. But even in 2008, when the play begins, there\u2019s little hope of legal re-entry. The same holds true in 2016, when the play ends, months before the presidential election would have made the family\u2019s situation that much worse.</p> <p>Bettis began writing the play before the 2016 election, thinking particularly of her Mexican maternal grandfather, whose American citizenship the family could never confirm. She wanted to try to write something intimate and grounded, a departure from her usual magical realist style. \u201cWe\u2019re so obsessed with narco culture and cartels and violence and that\u2019s not who my family is, it\u2019s not most Mexican American people I know,\u201d she said. Early readings included several actors who are undocumented. \u201cSo right away I had very early perspectives about what everyday life was like for people dealing with this,\u201d she said.</p> <p>After the election, a Republican victory that had been fueled, in part, by anti-immigrant sentiment, the play seemed more urgent. It made her think about the kinds of plays that she had written previously, \u201cvery raw and dirty and angsty and in your face and messy\u201d, Bettis said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to write that kind of stuff any more.\u201d She also didn\u2019t want to write a dissertation or a screed \u2013 she doesn\u2019t like plays to lecture her. Instead, she built 72 Miles along naturalistic lines, encouraging audiences to sympathize with this family, whatever its citizenship status. She chose a structure that spotlit small struggles rather than explicit tragedy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9cc8b60c55c6cad2acb707530ed9d1a808b963f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cc8b60c55c6cad2acb707530ed9d1a808b963f7/0_0_4480_6720/667.jpg\" alt=\"Hilary Bettis\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hilary Bettis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jo DeAngelis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The idea was, in part, to erase borders between audience and character, to argue for a shared humanity, to make spectators feel, as she feels, that there ought to be amnesty for America\u2019s 11 million undocumented immigrants. \u201cPeople wouldn\u2019t be coming here in the first place if they had safe homes,\u201d she said. \u201cThe people coming here love their countries, they love their culture, they love who they are. They\u2019re not trying to steal and take. They\u2019re just trying to live.</p> <p>\u201cWe really need to start seeing all of these people as our own families and our own children,\u201d she added. She made the father in the play a minister, just like her own father, and the daughter a nurse, like her mother. As she sat through \u201cgazillions of previews\u201d she found that some people did want a dissertation. Others wanted trauma porn. She has seen criticism of the show that demanded a more brutal story. \u201cBut why?\u201d she asked. That isn\u2019t how most Mexican Americans live, she said. And she wondered if critics would have wanted that for a black family or a Jewish family. There is tragedy enough, she suggested, in a girl deferring college or a boy enlisting or a mother and a father celebrating an anniversary by phone, a country away.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re making sacrifices of their dreams and their potential, they\u2019re passing this trauma down to their children,\u201d she said. \u201cIf that\u2019s not heartbreaking enough for a person, that\u2019s really more about who you are, than the play or the family.\u201d</p> <p>The abrupt closure of the play, Bettis\u2019s biggest production to date, is itself a small heartbreak. But if Bettis has doubts about the video providing an adequate substitute for the live experience, she did observe that some audiences may feel closer to 72 Miles now. \u201cWe are all living in isolation and uncertainty,\u201d she wrote. \u201cFor our country\u2019s 11 million undocumented people, that is a permanent way of life.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"http://72milestogo.roundabouttheatre.org/\">72 Miles to Go \u2026 is now available to stream on Vimeo</a>.</p></li> </ul>",

  "<p>The government has won an appeal over its controversial right to rent scheme, which was last year ruled by the high court to be racially discriminatory.</p> <p>The scheme, which is a key element of the Home Office\u2019s \u201chostile environment\u201d for illegal migration, requires private landlords to check the immigration status of tenants and prospective tenants. Those landlords that fail to complete checks can face fines and up to five years in prison.</p> <p>The high court found <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/01/right-to-rent-scheme-ruled-incompatible-with-human-rights-law\">last year</a> that requiring landlords to check the immigration status of prospective tenants was unlawful and racially discriminatory because it caused landlords to discriminate against British citizens from minority ethnic backgrounds and against foreign nationals who had a legal right to rent.</p> <p>The court ruled that the policy had a \u201cdisproportionately discriminatory effect\u201d, as well as \u201clittle to no effect\u201d on controlling immigration, and was incompatible with the right to freedom from discrimination, enshrined in European human rights legislation.</p> <p>But the Home Office appealed against that ruling, and the appeal court found that while some landlords did discriminate against would-be tenants who had no British passport, the scheme was nevertheless \u201cjustified\u201d as a \u201cproportionate means of achieving its legitimate objective\u201d.</p> <p>The judgement acknowledged that some landlords discriminated against people without a British passport due to \u201cadministrative convenience and a fear of the consequences of letting to an irregular immigrant\u201d, but added that most complied with the requirements without discriminating.</p> <p>Lawyers acting for the Home Office told the appeal court in January that the government could not be held responsible for landlords \u201cchoosing\u201d to discriminate by preferring tenants with a UK passport. About 17% of the population in England and Wales do not hold a passport.</p> <p>The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI), which opposed the government\u2019s appeal, argued that the state \u201cplainly is responsible for the discriminatory effects of its actions, whether intended or not\u201d.</p> <p>The JCWI said it was preparing to appeal against the ruling at the supreme court and renewed calls for the scheme to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/06/government-faces-high-court-challenge-right-rent-scheme\">repealed</a>.</p> <p>Chai Patel, the JCWI\u2019s legal policy director, said that the appeal court had upheld the high court\u2019s finding that landlords were discriminating against migrants or people of ethnic minority backgrounds as they sought to adhere to the right to rent legislation. However, the ruling did not conclude that this meant the scheme was in violation of human rights law.</p> <p>\u201cThe Home Office has always maintained that this racial discrimination wasn\u2019t caused by the scheme. Now we have two court rulings confirming that the government is causing racial discrimination in the housing market against ethnic minority British people, like the Windrush generation,\u201d Patel said. \u201cAt a time when our lives depend on our ability to stay at home safely, ethnic minorities and foreign nationals are being forced by the government to face discrimination in finding a safe place for them and their families to live.\u201d</p> <p>The junior immigration minister Chris Philp welcomed the decision. \u201cAs we have made clear throughout, the scheme ensures that only those with a legal right to be in the UK are able to access benefits and services, and [it] discourages people from entering the country unlawfully. This is also a question of fairness to UK citizens and the many people who come to the UK legally who all need to access housing.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The decade that followed the return of Joe Brown from national service to Manchester in 1950 was a crucial one in the exploration of Britain\u2019s rock outcrops and mountain crags and brought him a heroic status in the sport. Brown, who has died aged 89, was involved in the Rock and Ice Climbing Club, founded in 1951 by a group of Manchester climbers.</p> <p>He developed a partnership with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2005/mar/06/features.sportmonthly1\" title=\"\">Don Whillans</a> that was to become the most significant in modern climbing history. As a team, they were formidable, the boldness and physical strength of the slightly younger Whillans balancing Brown\u2019s inspired improvisations and innate rock-sense.</p> <p>The stages for the Rock and Ice advance were the Derbyshire outcrops and the range of cliffs along the north side of the Llanberis Pass in Snowdonia. On the August bank holiday of 1951, Brown joined forces with Whillans in an attempt on the right wall of Cenotaph Corner on Dinas Cromlech in the Llanberis Pass. Their first attempt ended in retreat as a cloudburst soaked the rock.</p> <p>A month later they were back, and this time succeeded on a route that was a psychological breakthrough in its acceptance of unremitting steepness and exposure, loose rock and poor protection. They called it Cemetery Gates, after a name Brown saw on the destination board of a bus as he returned through Chester that night. That October, the pair fought up Vember on Clogwyn Du\u2019r Arddu \u2013 Brown\u2019s second attempt after a near disaster two years previously \u2013 and the Rock and Ice revolution was under way.</p> <p>The activities of this group \u2013 and Brown in particular \u2013 expanded to include the French Alps, where British climbing had scarcely advanced for 50 years. On their first visit in 1953 the Brown-Whillans team made the third ascent in a very fast time of the recent Magnone route on the West Face of the Petit Dru \u2013 then deemed the hardest rock-climb in the Alps; they went on to climb an even harder line of their own on the West Face of the Aiguille de Blaiti\u00e8re that very soon gained and long retained a reputation for extreme difficulty.</p> <p>As a result, Brown was invited to join Charles Evans\u2019s reconnaissance expedition in 1955 to the 28,169ft <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Kanchenjunga\" title=\"\">Kanchenjunga</a>, the world\u2019s third highest peak and its highest unclimbed one at that time. Brown\u2019s acceptance, and apparent refusal to press for Whillans\u2019s inclusion \u2013 something he was in no position to do \u2013 was seen by the latter as a betrayal, and the two men, who had never been close friends, climbed less frequently together thereafter.</p> <p>The climb was far harder, more arduous and committing than the 1953 ascent of Everest. Brown led the final difficult rock pitch to the top, minus four feet, as an undertaking had been given to the King of Nepal not to tread on the actual summit of this holy mountain. His fame thereafter was assured. He followed up this success in 1956 with the first ascent of the Mustagh Tower, a 24,000ft rock spire in the Karakoram.</p> <p>By 1956 Brown had established himself as the most considerable all-round mountaineer in the history of the sport in Britain. His first ascents on Pennine, Welsh, Cumbrian and Scottish rock had significantly advanced the concept of the climbable; in the Alps and the Himalayas his record was no less impressive.</p> <p>He continued to climb into his old age and the list of his achievements grew longer with the years. His last recorded new climbs, on Welsh slate and in the Anti-Atlas of Morocco, were accomplished in his late 70s. But after those two great Himalayan ascents of the mid-1950s, his climbing involvement was more relaxed. </p> <p>In 1957 he married Valerie Gray. The horizons of his activity broadened. He began to be in demand for TV work, where his flinty, humorous commentary, phlegmatic even when in extremis, acted as anchor to outside broadcasts from places as far apart as the Valley of the Assassins in Iran, Welsh sea and mountain cliffs, Alpine aiguilles, Scottish sea-stacks and a wintry Ben Nevis.</p> <p>In 1967 he was one of those climbing the Old Man of Hoy, off Orkney, in an ascent televised by the BBC. <a href=\"https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/bafd5d5378ca4a1389fd6f18196c4c2d\" title=\"\">In 1984 he repeated the experience</a> with his younger daughter, Zoe, whose character came over as being as amused and engaging as his own. He even made a quirky series of television shorts about fishing in inaccessible places and acted as Jeremy Irons\u2019 double in the waterfall sequences of The Mission (1986) \u2013 the fact that Irons towered over him by almost a foot was concealed by careful camerawork.</p> <p>There was a measured wit and gravity and a light mocking touch about his screen persona that held true in all the relationships of his life. He instructed for a time at White Hall Outdoor Pursuits Centre in Derbyshire, where he found time to master canoeing. He loved to fish, alone or with close friends.</p> <p>He had new phases of intense exploratory activity on British rock. In the early 60s he combed the secretive valleys of southern Snowdonia for small, steep crags on which he sketched out the early masterpieces of climbing\u2019s modern age: Vector, Pellagra, Dwm, Hardd, Ferdinand. In 1965 he moved to Llanberis and opened the first of a small chain of outdoor equipment shops.</p> <p>He had significant climbing partnerships with men of younger generations. With Peter Crew, he developed the awesome sea-cliffs of Gogarth and South Stack, in Anglesey, producing an extraordinary series of routes: Mousetrap, Mammoth, Red Wall, Doppelganger, Wendigo. He continued to produce classic and teasing climbs long after Crew had failed to keep pace with his zeal, and made significant ascents of difficult peaks in the Andes.</p> <p>In the Himalayas he forged an alliance with Mo Anthoine and enjoyed trip after light-hearted trip \u2013 many of them unsuccessful in reaching their objectives and that did not matter to him one iota \u2013 to difficult peaks in Garhwal and elsewhere. Even in his 60s he took part in an expedition dogged by bad weather to Everest\u2019s then unclimbed north-north-east ridge.</p> <p>Born in Ardwick, Manchester, Joe was the seventh and last child of a poor Roman Catholic family. His father died when Joe was eight months old. Thereafter, his mother provided for the family through cleaning work and taking in laundry. </p> <p>Joe left school at 14 to work for a jobbing builder. From Manchester, the Pennine moors were no more than a bus-ride away: \u201cBy my 12th birthday, I knew that going into the country was more satisfying to me than anything else,\u201d he wrote. At first it was just playing around, then it gravitated to mine exploration in the abandoned copper workings at Alderley Edge and pot-holing in the White Peak. Inevitably, the progression was to climbing. For Brown this began among the arctic conditions of early 1947 in hobnailed boots at Kinder Downfall, above Hayfield, Derbyshire.</p> <p>The rapidity with which Brown became perhaps the most significant figure in British climbing history was astounding. Within weeks this short, slight 16-year-old had begun to lead mountain rock-climbs at the highest contemporary standard. His native talent needed an educated and organisational ability to lead it on to fame and achievement. He found it through a chance meeting at Kinder Downfall in the spring of 1947 with Merrick \u201cSlim\u201d Sorrell.</p> <p>Sorrell, three years older than Brown, was a pipe-fitter from Stockport whose solid and knowledgable company underpinned the first phase of Brown\u2019s pioneering on rock. That their ability was notably higher than the prevailing standards of the day was established on a visit to North Wales. They had viewed the climb known as Lot\u2019s Groove on the cliffs of Glyder Fach \u2013 alleged to be one of the harder climbs in Wales \u2013 and accomplished it on sight.</p> <p>On the same holiday Brown made an ascent of the Suicide Wall in Cwm Idwal \u2013 undoubtedly the hardest climb of its time in Britain. \u201cI didn\u2019t find it too bad,\u201d he told me many years later. By the summer of 1948, having mastered the most difficult of the existing climbs, he began turning out his own repertoire. Initially these climbs were on Derbyshire and Yorkshire gritstone edges \u2013 brutally steep outcrops of abrasive rock in the ascent of which Brown displayed a suavely rhythmical and relaxed genius.</p> <p>His ability was now bolstered by being right at the centre of a group of climbers from the Manchester and Derby areas, the Valkyrie Club. On crags such as Stanage and Froggatt Edges, Wimberry Rocks and Dovestones, the routes that marked British rock-climbing\u2019s postwar revolution and were to bring it in line with prewar continental standards were forged.</p> <p>Long-standing problems feared and revered by the sport\u2019s elders were vanquished beneath the insouciant plimsolls of a ragged and humorous 17-year-old youth. As a young climber myself in Manchester at the start of the 60s, I was intensely aware of his presence and how much he had achieved by then.</p> <p>I could understand how the other greats of the period climbed: fitness, physique, supple gymnasticism or sheer application. With Brown, there was something else at work. He was quite short, not heavily built, his movement smooth and deliberate.</p> <p>When I climbed with him, sometimes I would watch the way he made a move, copy it when I came to that point, and his way, that he had seen instantly, would be the least obvious and most immediately right. He was climbing\u2019s supreme craftsman, unerringly aware of the medium. That instinctual rock-sense never entirely left him.</p> <p>And with him, too, came a character generous, playful and straightforward. His mind may not have been academically trained, but he was sharp, informed, argumentative, and I think very wise. He loved the contest, be it physical or intellectual; he loved to wrestle.</p> <p>Once, after a first ascent on the Pembrokeshire sea cliffs with a lot of crumbling rock, I followed him and found him sitting on the cliff edge. He pulled me to the ground and boxed me about the ears for risking his life and limb, scolding me for what he called the loosest route he had ever done. But he was laughing, and we ran back in perfect humour across the unmarked beach.</p> <p>He needed the simplicity of that conflict and he was still generous and endearingly funny as he endured with dignity the ill-health of his final years.</p> <p>He is survived by Valerie, their two daughters, Helen and Zoe, and four grandchildren.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Joseph Brown, mountaineer, born 29 September 1930; died 15 April 2020</p>",

It is a hammer blow for millions more who can only eat if they earn a wage. Lockdowns and global economic recession have already decimated their nest eggs. It only takes one more shock \u2013 like Covid-19 \u2013 to push them over the edge. We must collectively act now to mitigate the impact of this global catastrophe.\u201d</p> <p>The new warning reinforces concern sounded by Lola Castro, regional director of WFP for southern Africa, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/25/coronavirus-threatens-to-turn-aid-crises-into-humanitarian-catastrophes\">last month</a>. She said the interruption of food programmes for millions of people in the 12 countries that they cover, which have experienced three years of poor harvests because of drought, would have a \u201ccritical impact\u201d.</p> <p>As Castro and other experts have made clear, what is occurring as coronavirus begins to bear down on the world\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable countries is a perfect storm that has seen coronavirus act as an accelerant on a host of well established problems from poverty, the impact of the climate crisis, pre-existing conflict and pre-existing health crises in places with high incidence of diseases like Aids and HIV and malaria.</p> <p>Perhaps most pressing, beyond the immediate threat of the disease, is the economic impact in countries less able to deal with the shock, particularly for workers on daily subsistence wages.</p> <p>Talking about the situation in southern Africa in an interview with the Guardian last month, Castro described the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/25/coronavirus-threatens-to-turn-aid-crises-into-humanitarian-catastrophes\">specific challenges in detail</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe lean season has been very, very hard for the last three years with almost no rain and poor harvests which have left 45 million people food insecure with 8.1 million supported by the WFP.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/20/un-heads-warn-of-coronavirus-risk-in-weakest-countries\">UN agencies issue urgent coronavirus appeal after $2bn request falls well short</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Already, as Castro points out, new restrictions on travel, border crossing and the threat of the disease has disrupted ongoing operations even as more people have been pushed towards poverty by lockdowns affecting their ability to work.</p> <p>\u201cWe are already the region of the world that is the most affected by HIV-Aids. We are having to totally change our distribution models: to reduce concentrations of people at distribution points; to make sure we have hand washing facilities and that people have PPE.</p> <p>\u201cThen we have to defeat borders, airlines closing, ports becoming affected, shipping and transport \u2026 we are fighting a humungous number of factors today.\u201d</p> <p>Other issues have been less visible, but are no less critical, not least any impact on southern Africa\u2019s infrastructure for food supplies which depends on a few keys ports including Durban in South Africa and Beira in Mozambique.</p> <p>And as Andrew Shepherd of the UK\u2019s Overseas Development Institute explains, the economic impact of coronavirus on the poorest will be felt most sharply.</p> <p>\u201cAny food price inflation that is a result of coronavirus will be worst for those who are poorest, especially those who depend on daily wages. One of the impacts of the border closures that we\u2019ve seen is that lots of poor people living along borders subsist on cross-border trading.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<p>The government, facing pressing and serious questions about its competence in every phase of the coronavirus crisis, concentrates its focus on that immediate challenge: this isn\u2019t the right time to launch an inquiry, ministers say, this is the time to come together. In bizarre, sixth-form language, they <a href=\"https://healthmedia.blog.gov.uk/2020/04/19/response-to-sunday-times-insight-article/\">pour scorn on media scrutiny</a>. Probably in some corner of a bygone world, that strategy still works. Yet questions over their capability are not the only challenge they face. More seriously, the virus threatens to upend the conservative worldview.</p> <p>We know that seismic, destructive events change assumptions, because we have the NHS as proof of it. Out of the second world war came the umbrella principle: if money was no object when it came to killing people, it should be no object when it comes to keeping them alive. From this sprang the greatest public housing project ever undertaken in this country, the extension of universal free education and, most importantly, the moral imperative that medicine should be free at the point of need.</p> <p>All these projects were undertaken at a time of epic national debt and genuine fiscal insecurity. The message was not so much \u201cmoney is no object\u201d as \u201cmoney has no meaning\u201d. Perhaps the NHS has emerged as the most important because it was the one that lasted, or perhaps it lasted because it was the most important. Either way, a principle was established: socialism in health, if nowhere else.</p> <p>Successive governments have made operational incursions into this territory, introducing markets and piecemeal privatisation in the last century, penny-pinching and more privatisation in this one; but it is politically unthinkable, to question the idea that treatment should be blind to wealth. It\u2019s not a practical point, that things are cheaper when you pool resources, and that people are more secure when they pool their risk; it is a moral commitment to health as a citizen\u2019s right. The notion of British exceptionalism is 99% cant, but the NHS genuinely is exceptional \u2013 and it has become part of the national story, with a huge amount hanging off it.</p> <p>This has led to some mightily weird tensions and contradictions in the public discourse. The overall direction of travel was towards ever greater marketisation, and yet this vast terrain of life-and-limb stayed, in principle at least, money-blind. Over the austerity years, when a life was still infinitely valuable in A&amp;E yet infinitely disposable during a benefit sanction, those conflicts played, if anything, better for the right. All the noble precepts around the NHS were so incongruous that they passed into the category of emotionality, whereupon they could be attached to anything, however irrelevant: have \u00a3350m for your NHS (if you leave the EU); get more great NHS access (if you get rid of immigrants). On the progressive side we saw healthcare as the sanctuary of all our pro-social impulses; but on the other side it was the repository for all contradiction and sentimentally, so that Nigel Farage could build rhetoric from it as effectively as Caroline Lucas could.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/turkish-ppe-flight-only-slim-chance-goods-will-arrive-in-uk-today\">Turkish PPE flight: only 'slim' chance goods will arrive in UK today</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now, something much more interesting has happened: health, and its socialist symbolism, has become the overriding priority, the most important determinant of policy. All kinds of organising principles and assumptions thus collapse or simply evaporate: profit is less important than life; productivity is less important than protecting people. Small, tight Thatcherite units of familial care have expanded to encompass neighbours, acquaintances, unknown nurses hundreds of miles way, whose altruism begets gratitude and empathy.</p> <p>We are forced to reevaluate the low-paid, who previously were portrayed as alternately vulnerable and parasitic, agents of their own misfortune, but with little agency anywhere else. We have the incalculable blessing of immigration paraded daily before our eyes. To get into that classic debate now \u2013 \u201cAre they net recipients or net contributors?\u201d \u2013 would be unimaginable. These paradigm shifts are already having huge impacts on political debate. If the undervalued have become suddenly precious, what will this crisis mean for those we previously valorised, such as the entrepreneurs?</p> <p>The concept of wealth creation has already, I suspect, become completely void: turns out you can\u2019t create it on your own; you need workers, and you need customers. The previously comfortable \u2013 discovering what it is to be insecure, to be reliant on the state, to be one paycheque from oblivion \u2013 will already have reworked their attitudes to social security. All the intellectual scaffolding of free-market fundamentalism, the ideas that held it up and maintained its sense of its own fairness, centred on the idea that money was its own virtue, that respectable and decent people found a way to get it, that those without it were derelict and feckless. It was never possible to dismantle this piece by piece, with graphs, with case studies, but exploding the whole thing happened pretty fast.</p> <p>As we approach the fifth week of lockdown, there\u2019s been a spurt of competitive pessimism, commentators vying to see who can predict the direst outcome: no, the corona era will not be good for the planet; it will usher in a new populism, a second wave of austerity more deadly than the first, a new authoritarianism; the world can only get worse. Yet what we see unfolding is quite different: hospitals, the one place where money didn\u2019t talk, have become our cathedrals, and the shockwaves are immense. If I were a Conservative government, I\u2019d be looking for a rebuttal to that \u2013 but I wouldn\u2019t rate my chances.</p> <p>\u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p> <p><br></p>",

Pons hopes it teaches listeners about European deforestation, which doesn\u2019t get nearly as much attention as what\u2019s happening in the Amazon. \u201cA lot of people told me it\u2019s soothing,\u201d she says, \u201cbut there are quite oppressive moments.\u201d</p> <p>There are physical benefits as well. <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep45273\">Studies</a> have found that the sound of gurgling streams and soft breezes can stabilise the blood pressure and heart rate of patients on the operating table, while terminally ill cancer patients have reported feeling less discomfort and anxiety if nature sounds are played at their bedside.</p> <p>In the late 1980s, when musician-turned-bioacoustician <a href=\"http://www.wildsanctuary.com/index.html\">Bernie Krause</a> put out such recordings as Distant Thunder and Dawn at Trout Lake, he found an audience among the unwell. \u201cPeople who had just gotten out of heart surgery, or undergone kidney replacement, would be in hospital writing to us about how these albums made them feel better.\u201d </p> <p>This aspect of field recordings is familiar to Emmy-winning acoustic ecologist <a href=\"https://www.soundtracker.com/\">Gordon Hempton</a>. When his wife found herself in hospital a few years ago, she listened to his 2005 albums Ocean Dreams and Songs of Spring.

  "<p>This weekend thousands of rightwing Americans took to the streets in several states to protest against the coronavirus \u201clockdowns\u201d, or stay-at-home rules, issued by their governors. Although most of the protests were marginal \u2013 counting dozens of people at best \u2013 conservative and liberal media outlets devoted considerable attention to them.</p> \n<p>Although officially protesting against the lockdowns\u2019 economic costs and what they viewed as infringements on their liberty, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/stay-at-home-order-protest-lockdown-maryland-texas-ohio\">the protesters</a> were expressing the usual hodgepodge of rightwing grievances. As always, opposition to abortion and immigration and support for President Trump and the second amendment were prominent.</p> \n<p>But perhaps my favorite slogan was a surprising one <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrChristensen/status/1251895654730915840\">spotted</a> at a rally in Minnesota: \u201cBe like Sweden\u201d. For years, Sweden has been the poster child of the US far right\u2019s feverish dystopias of European \u201csocialism\u201d \u2013 Breitbart, in particular, has an unhealthy obsession with the country. To see American rightwingers champion one of the few European countries still governed by a leftwing government is therefore truly astounding.</p> \n<p>The anti-lockdown protesters have obvious parallels with the early Tea Party mobilization of 2009, down to their prominent display of the Gadsden flag \u2013 the yellow flag with the picture of a snake and the text \u201cDon\u2019t tread on me\u201d, a historical American symbol appropriated by the Tea Party.</p> \n<p>The Tea Party movement was the most important US political movement of the early 21st century, but it has been almost completely written out of US political history in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s shock electoral victory. Conservatives and liberals have always interpreted the Tea Party through their own ideological lenses: where conservatives saw a spontaneous grassroots movement, liberals saw an \u201cAstroturf\u201d operation bankrolled and organized by powerful rightwing interests.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>For the sake of Trump's re-election, he is keen to move discussion from public health to the economy</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>A similar split in narratives has emerged over the anti-lockdown protests. Conservative media outlets have emphasized the grassroots aspect of the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-lockdown-rebellion-11587400850\">Lockdown Rebellion</a>\u201d, staying quiet about the protests\u2019 financial and organizational connections. In contrast, liberal media outlets have focused primarily on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/far-right-coronavirus-protests-restrictions\">these ties</a>, notably to the family of Trump\u2019s secretary of education, <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/coronavirus-updates/2020/04/a-devos-linked-group-promoted-the-right-wing-operation-gridlock-tantrum-in-michigan/\">Betsy DeVos</a>, a longtime and generous funder of rightwing political causes.</p> \n<p>Just like the Tea Party, the anti-lockdown protests are a combination of Astroturf and grassroots. In the case of the Tea Party, the two were united on socio-economic issues \u2013 \u201cTaxed Enough Already\u201d \u2013 but divided over socio-cultural issues, mostly because the Astroturf branch did not want to weaken the movement amid potential divisions over immigration and religious issues like abortion. While Americans for Prosperity and FreedomWorks, the well-financed rightwing groups that supported the movement, were successful in keeping the supportive rightwing media on socio-economic message, socio-cultural issues often dominated at the grassroots level, with opposition to abortion and immigration as well as thinly veiled racism focused on President Obama (including birtherism, the false idea that Obama was not born in the US).</p> \n<p>There is one crucial difference between these two rightwing protests, however: while the Tea Party attacked the White House, the anti-lockdown protesters clearly support it. In fact, Trump and the protesters are cheering each other on publicly. Pro-Trump banners are omnipresent at the protests, and Trump has repeatedly praised the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/17/trump-liberate-tweets-coronavirus-stay-at-home-orders\">very responsible</a>\u201d protesters.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/20/us-protests-lockdown-coronavirus-cases-surge-warning\">US anti-lockdown rallies could cause surge in Covid-19 cases, experts warn</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>On Friday, when rightwingers were announcing their protests on social media, the president loudly encouraged them in a series of all-caps tweets: \u201cLIBERATE MINNESOTA!\u201d, \u201cLIBERATE MICHIGAN!\u201d, \u201cLIBERATE VIRGINIA\u201d. An interesting selection of states, which shows that there is more at stake than just frustrations over the lockdown.</p> \n<p>Almost <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-map-stay-at-home-orders-lockdowns-2020-3\">95%</a> of Americans are under \u201clockdown\u201d at the moment; 42 states have issued stay-at-home orders. This includes many states with Republican governors, however late and reluctantly they came to that decision. But the protests largely target states with Democratic governors. Moreover, the three states singled out by President Trump in his tweets are key targets of his 2020 campaign \u2013 holding Michigan and flipping Minnesota are crucial for his re-election. He hopes to swing Virginia by mobilizing rightwing voters on gun rights and the lockdown.</p> \n<p>For Trump, the anti-lockdown protests provide him with visible popular support for his Covid-19 strategy. For the sake of his re-election, he is keen to move discussion from public health to the economy. Given that a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-04-16/coronavirus-protests-dumb-lockdown-rules-erode-public-trust\">clear majority</a> of Americans support the stay-at-home policies, Trump needs the momentum to shift. The protests can help him, by taking his struggle from the White House to the streets, and thereby to the media.</p> \n<p>However \u2013 as many Republicans found out the hard way, in the Tea Party era - the streets are more difficult to control than lobby organizations and rightwing media.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Cas Mudde is a Guardian US columnist and the Stanley Wade Shelton UGAF professor in the school of public and international affairs at the University of Georgia.

  "<p>Online comments made by the far right activist Tommy Robinson about a Syrian teenager amounted to accusations that the young refugee had \u201cparticipated in a violent assault on a young girl\u201d and \u201cthreatened to stab another child\u201d, a judge has ruled.</p> <p>In an interim ruling on a high-profile libel case, Mr Justice Nicklin said the \u201cnatural and ordinary meaning\u201d of the two Robinson videos, which have been viewed more than 900,000 times, related to a \u201cspecific allegation of violent conduct\u201d.</p> <p>The claim follows an incident in November 2018 when Jamal Hijazi, then 16, was pushed to the ground and threatened with drowning at Almondbury Community school in Huddersfield.</p> <p>Footage of the refugee student being pushed to the ground and having water poured on his face was watched millions of times, provoking outrage and a flood of public sympathy.</p> <p>Robinson, 37, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, then posted two videos on Facebook claiming Jamal was \u201cnot innocent and he violently attacks young English girls in his school\u201d.</p> <p>A full hearing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/may/15/tommy-robinson-sued-by-syrian-schoolboy-he-accused-of-assault\">the libel case</a> has yet to be scheduled. In his preliminary decision on Tuesday, the judge ruled that the accusations in the videos meant Jamal had \u201cas part of a gang, participated in a violent assault on a young girl which had caused her significant injuries and threatened to stab another child\u201d.</p> <p>Jamal\u2019s lawyers say the allegations are \u201cvery seriously defamatory\u201d. Mr Justice Nicklin, however, rejected their contention that Robinson\u2018s statements would be understood to suggest there were other \u201cincidents of violence beyond the particular acts that were identified\u201d in the videos.</p> <p>\u201cThe viewer would recognise that the defendant was making a specific allegation of violent conduct against the claimant,\u201d the judge said.</p> <p>Nicklin said the ordinary and reasonable viewer of the videos would understand Robinson to have been speaking figuratively when he said Jamal was \u201cnot innocent, he attacks young girls\u201d.</p> <p>The judge also rejected Robinson\u2019s suggested meaning of the statements, that \u201cas part of a gang, the claimant has committed serious acts of violence against a schoolgirl\u201d.</p> <p>Nicklin ruled that Robinson\u2019s suggested meaning \u201cfails to capture the gravity of the allegation being made against the claimant, specifically that [the girl] had been beaten \u2018black and blue\u2019 ... and ignores, completely, the allegation of a threat to stab the boy that is made clearly in the first video\u201d.</p> <p>In his ruling, Nicklin stated: \u201cIt is important to note that the court is only dealing with the issue of meaning. The defendant has advanced a defence of truth. Unless the parties resolve the litigation, that issue [and others] will be determined at a later trial.\u201d</p> <p>At a previous hearing last November, William Bennett QC, for Robinson, said his defence would focus on \u201cthose people who say they were assaulted by the claimant and the claimant\u2019s denials that he assaulted them\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>Immigration experts have told MPs that Home Office proposals to extend visas for NHS staff do not apply to as many workers as initially thought, have no legal backing and have been poorly communicated.</p> <p>Adrian Berry, the chair of the Immigration Law Practitioners\u2019 Association, and Colin Yeo, an immigration barrister and the founder of the Free Movement website, told the home affairs select committee there was no clarity over the plans announced on 31 March.</p> <p>The Home Office said 2,800 frontline NHS workers whose visas are due to expire before 1 October would have them extended for a year free of charge so that those workers could \u201cfocus on fighting coronavirus\u201d.</p> <p>But Berry told the committee the plans appeared to cover only holders of tier 2 visas \u2013 general work permits \u2013 and not those working on family reunion visas, and nor did they apply to porters, healthcare assistants or cleaners.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the problems that emerged is that the Home Office policy on extending leave to remain for such persons \u2026 initially appeared to include everybody working in the NHS but then subsequently looks as if it has been limited to those on tier 2 visas \u2013 work permit visas, in other words \u2013 and not family reunion visas or other things,\u201d Berry said.</p> <p>\u201cIt may also be restricted to certain types of work in the NHS \u2013 for example, doctors and nurses \u2013 and not those, for example, like hospital porters and others who do essential jobs in the National Health Service.\u201d</p> <p>Berry said the changes were not backed in law and he recommended that the government use a statutory instrument \u2013 secondary legislation that does not require a new act of parliament \u2013 to ensure NHS workers were not inadvertently breaching visa conditions.</p> <p>Berry said the only communications on the changes were online notices that had changed several times.</p> <p>\u200bYeo said:\u200b \u201cSome of the announcements we\u2019ve seen are for automatic grants of leave. There\u2019s some doubt in the legal community over whether that actually works as a matter of law because the legislation seems to require personalised written notice to be given to people to extend their leave or for there to be a statutory instrument.\u201d</p> <p>\u200bThe chair of the committee, Yvette Cooper, said the revelations were \u201ctroubling\u201d\u200b. The Home Office has been approached for comment.</p> <p>Tim Loughton, a member of the committee, said: \u201cThe general understanding has been that the government has granted a blanket extension to all NHS workers whose visas are due to come up for October 1st.</p> <p>\u201cWhat you\u2019re saying, to be clear, is: one, it\u2019s not clear that it\u2019s all NHS workers; it may just be limited to tier 2 visas. Secondly, even for those who do qualify on that basis, there\u2019s no legal backing for those protections without a statutory instrument at the very least, so they could find themselves inadvertently in good faith having accepted that extension when in fact they have no legal basis still to be here after their visa expires.</p> <p>\u201cAnd thirdly no formal instructions have been issued by the Home Office to professionals and others dealing in this field to say exactly what the situation is.\u201d</p> <p>Berry replied: \u201cIt\u2019s a good summary.\u201d</p>",

And the poorer the country, the less capable it is of addressing people\u2019s pressing needs, from identifying and treating cases of the virus to supporting communities and businesses deprived of income.<strong> </strong>The vast majority of people living in countries in sub-Saharan Africa are <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/region/afr/publication/for-sub-saharan-africa-coronavirus-crisis-calls-for-policies-for-greater-resilience\">employed in the informal sector</a> and receive no unemployment, sickness or other benefits.

Many of the world\u2019s poor have no access to life-saving medical facilities;<strong> </strong>in the entire African continent, there are just 20,000 critical care beds, equivalent to 1.7 for every 100,000 people. Malawi has just 25 ICU beds for its 17 million citizens, while in Bangladesh there are just 1,100 ICU beds for a population of more than 160 million. And while the UK health budget is $4,000 per citizen per year, in African countries it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c5d83d2-7595-11ea-95fe-fcd274e920ca\">averages $12</a>, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.</p> <p>In China and much of Europe, the coronavirus crisis precedes an economic crisis. But in many developing nations the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/12/pressure-grows-for-developing-world-debt-relief-over-coronavirus\">economic shock</a> has come first, as governments have locked down their economies to reduce the speed of contagion. As a result, countries in Africa and Latin America, together with Pakistan, India and Bangladesh, are expected to suffer their greatest ever economic decline. One immediate effect of the lockdown is hunger, as transport and distribution systems are severely disrupted and the food supply in many countries \u2013 already depleted after years of drought, extreme weather events and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/13/second-wave-of-locusts-in-east-africa-said-to-be-20-times-worse\">recent locust infestations</a> \u2013 becomes scarce.</p> <p>Then there is the question of how countries will cope with the coming medical emergency.<strong> </strong>In South Africa, for example, it is expected that the pandemic peak will only be reached <a href=\"https://www.thesouthafrican.com/news/sa-health-department-peak-coronavirus-lockdown/\">in September</a>, but incomes have already shrunk due to a lockdown that was announced before the UK\u2019s and is every bit as stringent as that in Italy. South Africa has mobilised domestically, working with civic organisations and businesses to create a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/south-africa-to-go-into-21-day-lockdown-on-thursday-night\">solidarity </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/south-africa-to-go-into-21-day-lockdown-on-thursday-night\">fund</a> to address the food and other needs of citizens, and reached out globally. However, even for one of Africa\u2019s richest countries, this may be inadequate to address the scale of the challenge.</p> <p>Many leaders are doing all they can under the circumstances, but both domestic and international action is required to limit the damage caused by Covid-19. South African president Cyril Ramaphosa\u2019s evidence- and equity-based approach stands in stark contrast with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/lula-bolsonaro-brazil-to-slaughterhouse-covid-19-coronavirus\">Jair</a><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/lula-bolsonaro-brazil-to-slaughterhouse-covid-19-coronavirus\"> </a></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/lula-bolsonaro-brazil-to-slaughterhouse-covid-19-coronavirus\">Bolsonaro\u2019s denialism</a> in Brazil, or Donald Trump\u2019s divisive actions in the US. But, while Covid-19 is a test of leadership everywhere, in countries with widespread and deep poverty where medical supplies are severely limited, even the best leaders cannot save their populations from health and economic vulnerabilities. Foreign assistance is essential.</p> <p>While rich countries can issue more debt in their own currencies, developing countries require foreign exchange to pay for much-needed imports, from lightbulbs to syringes. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/07/world-must-combat-looming-debt-meltdown-in-developing-countries-covid-19\">cost of foreign debt repayments</a> and imports have soared as the relative value of currencies in developing countries have declined by around 25%. Meanwhile, government revenues have plummeted due to a collapse in tax, tourism and migrant remittances as a result of the pandemic. Many<strong> </strong>cash-strapped governments can\u2019t adequately provide for their citizens\u2019 needs in normal times, let alone meet an unprecedented global emergency like this. The resulting cuts in other health areas, such as HIV therapies, and malaria- or cholera-eradication programmes, pose at least as big a risk to communities as Covid-19.</p> <p>International support has been lacking precisely when it is most needed. The US has turned its back on the world. The UK, like Europe, appears preoccupied with its own medical and economic emergencies; the ability of Commonwealth countries to cope with the pandemic appears to have fallen off its domestic agenda.

  "<p>The loss of summer sea ice in the Arctic is now very likely before 2050, new research shows, even if the carbon emissions driving the climate crisis are cut rapidly.</p> <p>The result has alarmed scientists but they said slashing greenhouse gases remained vital as this would determine whether Arctic summer ice vanished permanently or could recover over time. If emissions remain very high, there is a risk the Arctic could be ice-free even in the dark, cold winter months, a possibility described as \u201ccatastrophic\u201d.</p> <p>The last global scientific assessment of Arctic ice was in 2013. It predicted a complete loss of ice in the month of September, when it reaches its annual minimum, would occur only if CO2 emissions from human activities remained high. The new results are based on 40 of the latest computer models and is the best assessment to date of the fate of the Arctic ice.</p> <p>Since satellite records began in 1979, summer Arctic ice has lost 40% of its area and up to 70% of its volume, making it one of the clearest signs of human-caused global heating. In 2019, it shrank to its <a href=\"https://nsidc.org/news/newsroom/arctic-sea-ice-minimum-extent-2019\">second lowest extent</a> on record.</p> <p>The loss of the ice exposes the dark ocean, which absorbs more of the sun\u2019s heat and further ramps up temperatures. These changes are also being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/19/arctic-ice-melt-already-affecting-weather-patterns-where-you-live-right-now\">increasingly linked to more extreme weather</a> including severe winters, deadly summer heatwaves and torrential floods at lower latitudes such as in Europe and the US.</p> <p>\u201cAlarmingly the models repeatedly show the potential for ice-free summers in the Arctic Ocean before 2050, almost irrespective of the measures taken to mitigate the effects of climate change,\u201d said Ed Blockley, who leads the UK Met Office\u2019s polar climate programme and was one of the team behind the new research. \u201cThe signal is there in all possible futures. This was unexpected and is extremely worrying.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Dirk Notz, at the University of Hamburg, Germany, coordinated the analysis and said: \u201cIf we keep global warming below 2C, Arctic sea ice will nevertheless likely disappear occasionally in summer even before 2050.

In climate studies, the Arctic Ocean is said to be ice-free when it shrinks to fragments with a combined area below 1m sq km, which is 75% lower than in 2019.</p> <p>The models are not perfect and struggle to match closely the ice loss and global warming seen in historical data. \u201cThere is still a lot of uncertainty,\u201d Blockley said. \u201cBut all the models are clear that the sea ice will continue to decline. At some point, it will be gone, but when that happens is still uncertain.\u201d</p> <p>Sea ice also varies naturally from year to year, making it hard to predict the date of the first ice-free summer. \u201cThere are some models [in which the summer Arctic] goes ice-free in the next few years,\u201d said Blockley. But he cautioned that these are considered outliers and that climate scientists use the combined set of models to calculate the likelihood of events.</p> <p>Another surprising finding from the study is that an ice-free Arctic in the winter months appears possible if CO2 continues to be emitted at high levels. \u201cThat\u2019s not something we\u2019ve seen before in these projections,\u201d Blockley said. \u201cA winter ice-free event would be catastrophic, for some wildlife species [like polar bears] for example, that live and hunt around the sea ice.\u201d</p> <p>Wagner said the loss of Arctic sea ice could have far-reaching consequences, from increasing global heating to harming wildlife: \u201cIt also opens up a new ocean for human exploration, from oil and gas extraction, to increased shipping, to increased tourism, each with their own perils and benefits.\u201d</p> <p>Prof James Screen, at the University of Exeter, UK, said: \u201cIt is important to keep in mind that although we might see an ice-free Arctic in all scenarios by 2050, the expected frequency of ice-free summers differs between scenarios. Under a higher emissions scenarios there may be ice-free summers every year, but in lower emissions scenarios they might be occasional.\u201d</p> <p>Blockley said the new research showed cutting carbon emissions remained vital to prevent the worst impacts on the Arctic, adding: \u201cWe are showing there is still hope.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>In early March the alarm bells hadn\u2019t started ringing yet in India: a country with only six confirmed Covid-19 cases, three of them in Kerala. But within a few weeks the nationwide number had increased to 17,000, with cities including Mumbai showing thousands of cases and several hospitals <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/india-hospital-shuts-surge-coronavirus-cases-staff-200406134319556.html\">shutting down</a> in panic. Over the same time, Kerala \u2013 a relatively prosperous state on the southern tip of the subcontinent \u2013 would start to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d. The \u201cKerala model\u201d is <a href=\"https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/cover-story/story/20200427-how-kerala-flattened-the-curve-1668033-2020-04-18\">already being held up</a> around the world as a success story. How did it do it?</p> <p>First, Kerala started from a strong baseline. Its socioeconomic development is an example of what investments in human capital can do for poverty reduction and prosperity. It has vastly <a href=\"https://www.oxfamindia.org/featuredstories/10-facts-illiteracy-india-you-must-know\">higher literacy rates</a> and better health outcomes than the rest of India; the state has long been a Communist party stronghold, although its policies remain moderately social-democratic. Some of its strengths are also weaknesses: skilled workers are the state\u2019s major export \u2013 it receives more <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/nri/forex-and-remittance/india-was-the-top-recipient-of-remittances-worldwide-in-2018/articleshow/70310386.cms\">remittances from abroad </a>than anywhere else in India, much of which comes from the Middle East \u2013 and it is a large tourism hub. These are two factors that expose its inhabitants to a greater risk of transmission. </p> <p>The first three confirmed patients in Kerala were <a href=\"https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/kerala-now-confirms-third-case-of-coronavirus-1642789-2020-02-03\">Indian students living in Wuhan</a> who had returned home during the Chinese new year. However, as feared, the following weeks saw a high number of infections in the state and the confirmed number of cases increased to <a href=\"https://dashboard.kerala.gov.in/\">more than 100 by 24 March</a>. Kerala by then had one-fifth of Indian cases, despite having only 2.5% of India\u2019s population.</p> <p>The reason Kerala has managed to come out the other side so quickly is because of its strong public health system, clear risk communication and community participation. Despite its communist rule, Kerala\u2019s healthcare system is, in fact, highly privatised, with a healthy division of labour between the public and private sectors. This very decentralised system has withstood the test of two serious floods and another viral outbreak in recent years, often making good use of the voluntary and active engagement of the public.</p> <p>Kerala\u2019s efforts to address the pandemic had started as early as January. Indeed, its experience of dealing with the Nipah <a href=\"https://www.who.int/southeastasia/outbreaks-and-emergencies/health-emergency-information-risk-assessment/surveillance-and-risk-assessment/nipah-virus-outbreak-in-kerala\">outbreak in 2018</a>, a virus that had neither treatment nor vaccine available, came in handy. Learning from this episode, which saw a high proportion of hospital-acquired infections, the system had effective protocols in place, and stuck to the time-tested strategy of case isolation and contact-tracing, combined with an alert community surveillance system. Tens of thousands of people were in home quarantine this time, with compliance made possible via a mix of phone-based monitoring and neighbourhood watch initiatives.</p> <p>A severe lockdown was implemented before the national one: schools were shut, gatherings were banned, a stricter and longer quarantine than the national norm was deployed, and a few pious people who still insisted on praying in groups were even arrested. But this iron-fist approach was matched by socially valuable outreach policies. Supplies were <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pilimat/status/1251092685579972609?s=20\">home-delivered</a>, midday meals from schools were sent to children even when schools were shut, regular and clear communication channels were established to dispel fake news, migrant labourers from other states were well taken care of, and mental health helplines were established across the state. The \u201c<a href=\"https://www.ndtv.com/kerala-news/kerala-launches-break-the-chain-campaign-to-combat-coronavirus-2196103\">break the chain</a>\u201d campaign to limit the Covid-19 spread was particularly successful.</p> <p>When unexpected events potentially exposed hundreds of people to infection, thousands of state-employed health workers and volunteers equipped with maps and flowcharts conducted aggressive contact-tracing and brought the situation under control. Kerala\u2019s has been an all-of-government, all-of-society approach, with even students chipping in, building walk-in kiosks for taking samples, inspired by the South Korean model. In addition to using the centrally procured real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing kits, Kerala was the first state to procure rapid test kits from the Pune-based Mylab.</p> <p>For most people, Covid-19 is a mild infection that can go away without treatment and can, therefore, be missed easily. It is deadly perhaps also for the same reason. As rich, muscular hospital systems across the world \u2013 which have opted for a spaghetti western-style standoff with the coronavirus \u2013 are quickly getting overrun, perhaps there are lessons to be learned from the nimble-footed, community-oriented, cautiously aggressive approach that Kerala opted for. For a state that had its first patient in January, the profile of patients (more than 90% under 60 years old, thanks to social distancing protecting the old) as well as the number of deaths (just <a href=\"https://www.mohfw.gov.in/\">three</a>), are nothing but impressive. </p> <p>While the curve has been flattened for now and transmission limited, the fact remains that Kerala is also riding the tiger of a strict economic lockdown in the rest of the country. Kerala aims to lift restrictions soon \u2013 a move that New Delhi <a href=\"https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/coronavirus-update-home-ministry-objects-to-kerala-easing-of-lockdown/story/401452.html\">has </a><a href=\"https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/coronavirus-update-home-ministry-objects-to-kerala-easing-of-lockdown/story/401452.html\">condemned</a> .<strong> </strong>How it manages to ease the lockdown safely will depend on a large number of factors. The summer monsoon rains, the floods that will follow, as well as returning migrants will add layers of complexity. But one thing is clear: when the next wave of novel coronavirus hits, which it will, the state will be ready.</p> <p>\u2022 Oommen C Kurian leads the health initiative at the Observer Research Foundation, a thinktank based in New Delhi</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 24 April 2020.

  "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> has forced theatre-makers to change the ways in which they collaborate, with many starting to make work remotely. But Belarus Free Theatre\u2019s founders, Natalia Kaliada and Nikolai Khalezin, have had to work this way for years. Exiled from their home country for a decade, and living in London, their circumstances have obliged them to find creative new ways of continuing to make work. \u201cWe were one of the first theatre companies to use Skype,\u201d explained Khalezin when we spoke earlier this year, \u201cbut this was a necessary measure. In 2011, when we ended up here and our cast was back in Belarus, we still needed to make shows, so we started trying out different technologies.\u201d</p> <p>Their latest production is an adaptation of Alhierd Bacharevic\u2019s 2017 novel, Dogs of Europe, a 900-page dystopian political thriller with a section written in a language of Bacharevic\u2019s own design. It is considered one of the most important literary works ever published in Belarus. Kaliada and Khalezin, who are married, have been working with a composer in Toronto, one in Berlin and a video director in Kiev. From their kitchen in London, we watch a scene play out in a warehouse in Minsk, before Khalezin embarks on a discussion with one of the cast members about the feasibility of him running around the stage naked for the duration of the interval.</p> <p>In the last few weeks, BFT has doubled its activities. When the UK went into lockdown they instructed their company in Minsk to self-isolate, though there had been no official guidance in Belarus about doing so. They then set about creating <a href=\"http://belarusfreetheatre.com/15th/\">the Love Over Virus project</a>, an attempt during a time of fear to \u201clet people dream again\u201d. Actors will be reading fairytales they were told as children, or that they tell their children, with contributions from trustees and supporters, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/juliet-stevenson\">Juliet Stevenson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/samuel-west\">Samuel West</a>, as well as Kaliada\u2019s own actor father, Andrej. </p> <p>They are also resurrecting their Kitchen Revolution project, an online space for provocation, conversation and communal dining. A recipe is shared with participants, before they debate, among other things, how it is possible to survive our current situation, survival being an area in which the theatre-makers have considerable experience.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94b7de5d1142f93eeca68d2e8bb62b8f8bf04338\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94b7de5d1142f93eeca68d2e8bb62b8f8bf04338/0_171_2346_1408/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicolai Khalezin and Natalia Kaliada, founders of Barus Free Theatre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicolai Khalezin and Natalia Kaliada, the founders of Belarus Free Theatre, exiled in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniella Kaliada</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This year marks the company\u2019s 15th<sup> </sup>anniversary. Over that time, through a combination of tirelessness and fearlessness, they\u2019ve found ways of continuing not only to exist but to flourish creatively in a repressive environment: operating underground, risking arrest and worse. Shows are performed in private, such as in homes, garages, street cafes and outside the city in the woods, with audience members informed of the location via social media. In 2016, to mark their 10th anniversary, they simulated the experience for London audiences, keeping the locations \u2013 including a former ambulance garage \u2013 secret, and communicating with audiences by text.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It doesn\u2019t matter whether it's a dictatorship or democracy, there is always a necessity for artistic provocation</p> <footer> <cite>Natalia Kaliada</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The company\u2019s work made them a target of the authorities in Belarus. In August 2007, the entire BFT company, as well as the audience, were detained before their performance of an Edward Bond play. Company members have lost state jobs and been beaten up. In 2011, while abroad, they discovered they would face imprisonment if they returned to their home country. Driven into exile, they sought asylum in the UK.</p> <p>They founded Belarus Free Theatre with the director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2014/sep/20/british-theatre-finance-funding-grants\">Vladimir Shcherban</a> in 2005. Khalezin was already an established playwright but, even though his work was not explicitly political, it wasn\u2019t allowed on the stage in Belarus. So they set about creating their own theatre, with no building but a clear ideological purpose. By 2006, they were touring internationally. It soon became apparent to Kaliada that \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter whether it is a dictatorship or democracy, there is always a necessity for artistic provocation in order to create public discussion, to make the audience think\u201d.</p> <p>In the Belarus Free Theatre model, art and activism are indivisible. Kaliada has proved adept at attracting high-profile patrons and supporters, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/stoppard\">Tom Stoppard</a>, in order to ensure the plight of her country and its citizens remains visible in the eyes of the west.</p> <p>Belarus is still somewhat simplistically described as \u201cEurope\u2019s last dictatorship\u201d, as if other countries weren\u2019t edging closer to that status. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/alexander-lukashenko\">Alexander Lukashenko</a> has been in power since 1994, and his presidency has been characterised by a climate of extreme political repression, enforced disappearances, systematic harassment of activists and independent media, a woeful track record on the human rights of disabled people, the LGBT and Roma communities. Belarus is also the only European country that still has the death penalty. A journalist before he was a playwright, Khalezin edited three newspapers until, one by one, they were closed by the government.</p> <p>\u201cPutin has a programme for the resurrection of the empire,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a new ideology which other countries gladly accept. Not a dictatorship but a monarchy without the monarch. Can you imagine a president being in power for 25 years in a normal society? It\u2019s a new type of monarchy. This is what many democratic leaders want. Boris Johnson would give his left arm to rule the country in the same way.\u201d</p> <p>Over the past 15 years, the company have addressed many of the issues facing Belarus, including the position of LGBT and disabled people in society. Kaliada believes that theatre can help bring about change but says: \u201cI also don\u2019t believe it is possible to change something with one performance,\u201d she says. \u201cYou need to work from the grassroots to the top and in all possible directions, to make all layers of society talk to each other.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"61d4b9047c45bb5ef295e987ca2bfd91d47ddd4d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61d4b9047c45bb5ef295e987ca2bfd91d47ddd4d/0_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dogs of Europe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A very powerful warning\u2019 \u2026 Dogs of Europe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kolya Kuprich</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The position of artists in Belarus is slowly changing, explains Khalezin. Having been prohibited for 15 years, BFT were recently invited to participate at a national showcase. In the end, they performed in a garage, as they have in the past, because they would otherwise have been required to get the minister of culture\u2019s approval for their work. \u201cIt\u2019s the illusion of freedom,\u201d says Khalezin. \u201cBut it\u2019s still better than the situation where every week you have police. We\u2019re in a stage neither of war nor peace.\u201d</p> <p>When I went to Minsk to see the premiere of Dogs of Europe in March, the location of the performance was leaked, but this didn\u2019t seem to deter or worry people overly. What was most palpable was the exhilaration people felt in seeing this book, which intertwines the country\u2019s history, present and future, brought vividly to life, in a production staged with a characteristic combination of intense physicality and striking visual imagery \u2013 most notably a sequence in which books burst into flame, words burning.</p> <p>Bacharevic\u2019s novel tells us, according to Khalezin, that \u201cin a dictatorship the authoritarian leader isn\u2019t guilty but all of us are\u201d. He regards it as \u201ca very powerful warning\u201d. He fears that the UK is in danger of heading in the same direction because it \u201cdoesn\u2019t have enough strength to stop this process. There is not enough political will and not enough will in general.\u201d</p> <p>Over the last 10 years, Kaliada has seen the erosion in the UK of many human rights, freedoms of expression and internationalism, and she feels that they arrived here at the \u201clast moment when it was possible to touch what freedom is\u201d. Their work has often ended up feeling predictive, she says, citing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jun/23/belarus-free-theatre-red-forest-review-young-vic-lift\">Red Forest</a>, their 2014 play about the global toll of environmental catastrophe that predated the refugee crisis. \u201cThe majority of critics in London said you don\u2019t understand anything, it won\u2019t happen here. But we spent time in a refugee camp talking to refugees about what was happening, and it was so clear to us.\u201d</p> <p>Dogs of Europe was supposed to play at the Barbican in London in May but the performance has been cancelled because of the lockdown. In Belarus, very little has been cancelled. Lukashenko <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2020/mar/29/there-are-no-viruses-here-belarus-president-plays-ice-hockey-amid-covid-19-pandemic-video\">has been dismissive</a> of what he calls \u201ccoronavirus psychosis\u201d, claiming the world has gone mad. The western coverage has chiefly focused on his statements about combating the virus with vodka and saunas, often treating it like a joke, seemingly oblivious to the fact that people will die as a result. While mass gatherings are banned in most countries, Lukashenko is building a 9,000-seat arena for a military parade due to take place in May. The KGB have been tasked with tracking down those \u201cspreading disinformation\u201d. </p> <p>There\u2019s a dangerous tendency, Kaliada says, for the west to dismiss Lukashenko as a \u201cpolitical clown\u201d. The west does not understand what it is like to live in a dictatorship, she says. \u201cThis is a major threat to the population. He\u2019s using the same methods used during the time of Chernobyl. Mass disinformation. This is another way to kill his people.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.belarusfreetheatre.com/\">Belarus Free Theatre</a> is making its archive available online each weekend for the next three months via <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/BelarusFreeTheatre\">its YouTube channel</a>.</p>",

I have to confess that I\u2019m so frazzled that I can hardly read a tweet without interrupting myself to refresh the news feed and so AL Kennedy\u2019s latest collection of wise, funny, human short stories came at just the right time. I dipped in and out of them over the course of a couple of days and emerged feeling better about the world than I had in a while.</p> <p>Kennedy is a strange writer, wilfully difficult to classify, hugely prolific. This is her seventh collection of short stories (Kennedy, at only 54, also has 10 novels and four works of nonfiction to her name). Here, we are introduced to a typically eccentric cast of characters, each of them caught in seemingly very different situations linked only by their struggle to answer the existential question posed by the collection\u2019s title.</p> <p>Almost all of the characters in these stories are, as one of them describes himself, \u201cunreliable in the head\u201d, prone to visions and elaborate self-delusions, all in the attempt to get through the day. Kennedy is brilliant at subtly shifting the ground of her stories, gently rotating your perspective so that by the end you\u2019re facing in quite the other direction, not sure of how you got there. So it is that in Panic Attack, your suspicions about the intentions of the mumbling, \u201cone-man bridgehead\u201d, Ronnie, slowly change into something entirely different; similarly, the description of the Salazar, a restaurant that is \u201ca glorious survival of Old Chelsea\u201d, starts off seductively, making the \u201cyou\u201d the story addresses feel quite at home, before you realise the waspish intelligence at work here.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard, in these horrifying times, to read anything without seeing within it dark new significations, shadows of the present on this book written in a very different past. This is a collection about the difficulty of living with each other \u2013 whether in a marriage (the newlywed in Walker), in a political system (the protester in It Might Be Easier to Fail) or in war and the aftermath of it (in the collection\u2019s two standout stories: Unanswered and Even Words Have Meaning).</p> <p>Two of the final three pieces of the book \u2013 New Mexico and Spider \u2013 are full of foreboding and are deeply unsettling. In the first, a presenter milking the podverse\u2019s obsession with true crime reveals a story of her own to match that of her subjects; in Spider, a mother allows her darkest fears to seize control of her life. But then, relief. In the final, titular tale, a woman and her lover are at the top of Cologne Cathedral and we\u2019re at first unsure as to what they feel for one another, if they are in danger, even. But then love breaks over them, we realise that love had been there all along and we leave the couple facing their return to England: \u201cTomorrow we\u2019ll fly back to our little island. We don\u2019t know what will save us there. We\u2019ll want to save each other, be the saving of each other. We\u2019ll hope to be lucky, lucky enough. Tiny, tiny. Gentle, gentle. Lucky, lucky.

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Global deaths pass 170,000</h2> <p>More than 170,000 people have lost their lives in the coronavirus pandemic so far, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. There have been more than 2.47 million cases worldwide. Just under a quarter of global deaths \u2013 42,000 \u2013 have been in the US. The UK has nearly 126,000 cases and more than 16,500 deaths.</p> <h2><strong>Trump announces plan to suspend immigration to US</strong></h2> <p>US president Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/trump-says-he-will-impose-immigration-ban-in-bid-to-tackle-coronavirus\">announced on Twitter </a>that he will \u201ctemporarily suspend\u201d immigration to the US, referring to the \u201cInvisible Enemy,\u201d a term he has used in the White House press briefings and on Twitter to refer to coronavirus.</p> <h2><strong>Singapore sees second-wave spike of cases</strong></h2> <p>Singapore, which has been lauded for its initial response to the outbreak, has seen a surge in cases, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/singapore-coronavirus-outbreak-surges-with-3000-new-cases-in-three-days\">reporting a record 1,426 new coronavirus cases </a>on Monday, mostly among foreign workers. The tiny city-state now has the highest number of cases in Southeast Asia, a massive increase from just 200 infections on 15 March, when its outbreak appeared to be nearly under control. About 3,000 cases have been reported in just the past three days. It has a total of 8,014 confirmed infections.</p> <h2><strong>Hong Kong extends social distancing measures for 14 days</strong></h2> <p>Chief executive Carrie Lam has announced an extension of the city\u2019s social distancing measures.

  "<p>A few weeks ago, on a day that was probably like today now that the days are all frighteningly different and yet strangely the same, Disney launched Disney+, its new streaming service, in the UK. The precise date, for those that are still tracking such things, was 24 March, which was also, by coincidence, the date the British lockdown officially started. I had been waiting, impatiently, for both. One felt frivolous, the other historic \u2013 a new thing to watch to add to the endless other things to watch versus the sudden transformation of an entire population\u2019s way of life \u2013 and yet here they were entwined, perfectly compatible bedfellows.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/08/feasting-on-fantasy-my-month-of-extreme-immersion-in-disney-plus-podcast\">\u2018Feasting on fantasy\u2019: my month of extreme immersion in Disney Plus \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Disney couldn\u2019t have known that the launch of Disney+ would fall upon the same day that 66 million people would be instructed to stay at home for 23 hours a day. They must have set their launch date months ago, long before the first coronavirus case hit Britain, or travellers returned from their fateful half-term Italian skiing holidays, or the prime minister glad-handed his way around a hospital. But to the cynical, it felt like the workings of a darkly prescient marketing strategy. I mean, the timing was <em>ideal</em>. Someone, somewhere in the Disney multiverse must have celebrated \u2013 shyly, inappropriately, a quiet elbow bump in a meeting room, perhaps.</p> <p>For anyone with a thing for family-friendly entertainment, the prospect of Disney+ was inviting. But for those of us coming to terms with home schooling and Easter \u201cholidays\u201d, followed by yet more home schooling, days upon weeks upon days of <em>time</em> \u2013 and not the kind of time you can revel in, but time that would be filled with fear for the wellbeing of people you love, and panic at the conundrum of trying to earn a living and look after your kids \u2013 well for us, the launch of Disney+ was a goddamn digital miracle.</p> <p>Maybe it didn\u2019t feel like that for everyone. Maybe the parents who secretly love the home schooling vibe, the timetables and worksheets, the children sitting happily at kitchen tables, tongues sticking out of the side of their mouths as they complete little astronomy quizzes while the parent stirs a healthy stew, maybe they didn\u2019t sign up for Disney+ a full week before it launched. For the rest of us, hurling fish fingers into the oven with one hand while trying to tap out a piece of work with the other and break up a fight with a toe, the relatively low cost of a Disney+ subscription (\u00a35.99 a month) when contemplating the long, long, just so very <em>long,</em> period of time ahead of us, felt like a sensible investment.</p> <p>Sure, there\u2019s other TV. There\u2019s the BBC. There\u2019s Netflix. I dabble in it all, unfussy when it comes to shiny, child-absorbing entertainment. But Disney+ is a luxury bath of content, of Disney old and new. When you log on to its sleek black home page, it shows off its wares so easily: thumbnails of Toy Story 4 and the new Star Wars spin-off series, The Mandalorian<em>,</em> casually sitting next to each other like reunited friends from different planets. The animated classics are all there \u2013 Cinderella, The Lion King, Aladdin \u2013 accompanied by their \u201creimagined\u201d live-action versions, updated and often unambiguously ruined. But there are also hidden treats, movies you\u2019d forgotten exist but sentimentally love more than members of your family (Cool Runnings). There\u2019s an entire section devoted to nostalgia. Three Men and A Little Lady? Yes, please. Nestling among it all is almost the entire back catalogue of The Simpsons, more than 600 episodes, patiently waiting to swallow the rest of your life.</p> <p>Some early adopters have quibbled that once you get past The Mandalorian and a few other new offerings (Meghan Markle narrating the nausea-inducing nature \u201cdocumentary\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/30/elephant-review-meghan-markle-adds-schmaltz-to-disney-yarn\" title=\"\">Elephant</a><em>,</em> anyone?), there\u2019s not much to go on, but perhaps they don\u2019t have kids happy to watch the same movie until they can recite it by heart. At some point, my husband put on the 2008 movie Bolt, about a run-of-the-mill little white dog, voiced by John Travolta, who is under the false impression that he is a superhero. A bulletproof concept, and sure enough, the movie went down so well that my kids, aged six and three, requested to rewatch it the moment the credits rolled. Forget awards, forget reviews: there is no better compliment a movie can receive than the immediate need a child can feel to watch it again. I remember that feeling. We wallpaper our souls with this stuff.</p> <p>Disney has been colonising the minds and hearts of children for decades. Wade through Disney+ as an adult and you find that, inevitably, some of the movies aren\u2019t as flawless as you recall, but you also find yourself blinking rapidly, at the mercy of a cinematic formula that knows the synaptic shortcut to both your childhood memories and your tear ducts. The nostalgia section \u2013 delivered at a time when reality can be hard to stomach and worries rise at unexpected times of the night \u2013 has the calming effect of one of those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/mar/10/feel-better-now-the-rise-and-rise-of-the-anxiety-economy\" title=\"\">weighted anxiety blankets</a>. When the outside world has shut down, you can burrow inwards and time travel through whatever anachronistic creation \u2013 Hannah Montana, Boy Meets World, DuckTales \u2013 transports you to your younger self, when you watched TV on a sofa you didn\u2019t have to buy with your own money, and someone else was doing most of the worrying so you could eat toast and think only about what you might eat after the toast.</p> <p>So yes, I admit it. I subscribed to Disney+ on the pretext of occupying my kids, but of course \u2013 of <em>course</em> \u2013 I actually bought it for myself.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>We began our Disney+ immersion, out of respect, with the canon. It happened to be the week my husband had the virus mildly, days he spent mostly unconscious except when he rose from his sweat pool to recount the plotlines of his hallucinatory nightmares. With a cursory nod to the abandoned ideals of home schooling, I decided to embrace Disney+ with a certain academic rigour. We started at the beginning, and worked our way through Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and Pinocchio (1940), before making a leap forward to Alice in Wonderland (1951), Peter Pan (1953) and Sleeping Beauty (1959). Not all on the same day, I should add, but I\u2019m not going to lie: the viewing schedule was intense.</p> <p>In many ways, this part felt like duty: ticking off the fundamentals before we could get on to the good stuff. In the early movies, the animators are so deferential to their source material that the \u201caction\u201d starts with an ancient book of the tale being opened, its pages of gothic script and hand-drawn pictures very slowly turned, as a sonorous male voice earnestly narrates the story. \u201cCome ON,\u201d my six-year-old yelled at the television, used to a more intense fix of cortisol to propel her through her entertainment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"587935125848ea639677fcd47031c3d0047572df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/587935125848ea639677fcd47031c3d0047572df/0_0_1816_2775/654.jpg\" alt=\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, from 1937.\" width=\"654\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, from 1937.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cinetext/Disney/Sportsphoto/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The animation itself is disconcertingly 2D, but from the off, you can\u2019t help credit Disney with its sheer devotion to its own shtick. Snow White might be almost featureless in her aesthetic simplicity, like a particularly extreme Botox victim, but that winning alchemy of cute animal friends and tuneful songs, adorable eyes and tightly waisted dresses, is all there in 1937 just as it\u2019s there, still, in Frozen 2, 82 years later. There are some formulas so reliable that nothing needs to change, except the sheer variety of associated merchandise.</p> <p>Inevitably, there are some jarringly anachronistic moments. Many of the early films have a warning at the start that they contain images of smoking. (In one comic set piece in Pinocchio, a cute fish blows thick grey smoke rings out of its bowl, an image that really wouldn\u2019t fly nowadays.) The age of Disney\u2019s heroines being symbols of women\u2019s empowerment is still some way off \u2013 many of the early female leads share a kind of saccharine fragility that would make Moana scoff from her one-woman sailing mission. And there are episodes of flat-out racism, too. Peter Pan, for example, has a physically-painful-to-watch number about Native Americans, called What Made The Red Man Red. Disney has added a euphemistic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/14/disney-attaches-warnings-of-outdated-cultural-depictions-to-classic-films\" title=\"\">disclaimer</a> to Peter Pan and other movies containing similar disasters: \u201cThis program is presented as originally created. It may contain outdated cultural depictions.\u201d The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/19/song-of-the-south-the-difficult-legacy-of-disneys-most-shocking-movie\" title=\"\">most egregious example</a> of all \u2013 Song of the South, from 1946, set on an uncritically idealised plantation and ridden with stereotypes \u2013 has been kept off the service altogether.</p> <p>Aside from their missteps, the early movies contain moments that ring oddly true in a pandemic. While my kids protested at the lethargic pace of Alice in Wonderland, I found myself absurdly over-identifying with her Wonderland experience, a place where things seem superficially familiar but are fundamentally altered. Near the end, Alice reaches a door through which she can see herself sleeping: \u201cBut that\u2019s me! I\u2019m asleep! Alice, wake up! Please wake up, Alice!\u201d Who <em>hasn\u2019t</em> felt like that, these past weeks? Not just the whole living-nightmare scenario, but that particular dissociation of constantly seeing yourself in the corner of a laptop screen while you try and listen to someone else talk. Wake up, I want to say to myself. Stop looking at yourself! Wake up!</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Enough cartoons: we were ready for real people. One eternal Saturday, though it could have been a Sunday or a Tuesday, or any of the other \u201cdays\u201d, I decided it was time. The kids had ravaged their way semi-dismissively through the old animations and plenty of the new ones were already as familiar to them as their own beating hearts: no one in this flat needs to watch Frozen again. At this point, Bolt was already on its fourth viewing, and had infiltrated many aspects of our lives. Our football had been renamed after the deluded dog and, like Wilson in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/jan/12/culture.reviews\" title=\"\">Cast Away</a>, become our beloved inanimate pet. In a distinct bid for freedom from each other and their parents, the kids had built their own cushion-walled enclaves at opposite ends of our flat, both of which were guarded by soft-toy dogs, also called Bolt. Before Bolt became the only name my son would answer to, I decided it was time to move my offspring forward in their cultural education, to expose them to one of the great artefacts of the late 80s, to a piece of cinema that will stand the test not just of its time, but all time. It was time to watch Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.</p> <p>Jesus, the opening shot. A mailman delivers letters down an anytown residential street, and it is the fantasy version of American suburbia in its absolute blue-skied, big-shirted, ice-cream-sundae heyday. I can\u2019t tell you how much, aged 12, I wanted to live in one of these clapboard houses, with a white picket fence and grass on either side of the sidewalk, with kids on bikes in the middle of the street and mailboxes at the end of the front path. I think I still do. In Honey, there are so many period-specific elements that seem designed to spark joy: a woozy saxophone soundtrack, those round foamy headphones, one of those long spiral cords from a phone attached to the kitchen wall in which characters get tangled, baseball caps and lumberjack shirts, collared sweaters with the collars up. For the kids, it was like watching a movie about the Victorians: the funny costumes! The funny cars! But for me, it was like falling back in love with someone I\u2019d forgotten existed. I went deep, losing myself not just in reminiscence or a fresh appreciation of superlative film-making, but in the movie\u2019s surprising thematic relevance to our current state. (Apologies in advance.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c65e69897e43469f4cc04d8a4c61e66fc546caaa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c65e69897e43469f4cc04d8a4c61e66fc546caaa/0_0_2864_1719/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Honey I Shrunk The Kids, from 1989.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Honey I Shrunk The Kids, from 1989.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Disney/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the unfortunate minority unfamiliar with the plot of Honey, I Shrunk the Kids \u2013 well, it\u2019s all in the title, my friends. The cast includes a wacky scientist dad (an irrepressible Rick Moranis as Wayne Szalinski), a long-suffering mum, two kids, the neighbours and their two kids, and a crucial dog called Quark. When Szalinski is out one day, all four kids are accidentally shrunk by his shrinking machine in the attic. When I say shrunk, I mean <em>shrunk</em>. They\u2019re tiny. Significantly smaller than Lego men. Smaller than ants. At some point they actually encounter an ant and it appears elephantine. Later, they ride it. Crucially, no one can hear them \u2013 their parents think their kids have gone missing and call the police. There\u2019s a tragic moment when Szalinski comes home from the shops, can\u2019t hear them screaming at him in the attic, and then smashes up the shrinking machine on which he believes he\u2019s wasted years of his life. As the screws start to fall, not only is he destroying a miracle machine that we now know works \u2013 the dramatic irony! \u2013 but he\u2019s endangering four children\u2019s lives as debris rains down on their heads. He then unknowingly sweeps them up and dumps them in a rubbish bag at the end of the garden.</p> <p>So begins this particular Odyssey. Honey is a classic journey movie: but instead of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/04/the-revenant-review-gut-churningly-brutal-beautiful-storytelling\" title=\"\">Revenant</a>-ing across wilderness, or 1917-ing through the trenches, the kids have to traverse a back garden to get home. Don\u2019t, for a <em>second</em>, doubt the scale of this challenge. When they rip open the rubbish bag and look at the jungle of grass they have to cross, it is a shattering sight. Much of the threat relies on the excellent effects. A butterfly flies overhead, and its wings beat and throb like a military helicopter. A monstrous dead beetle floats down a trickle of dirty water that resembles the Amazon. There\u2019s a swarm of bees: pure horror.</p> <p>To cut a predictable story short, they make it, only for one of them to end up on Szalinski\u2019s spoon and almost get eaten with a mouthful of Cheerios. But eventually they are restored to normal size and all ends well. As with any good Disney film, all sorts of lessons have been learned along the way, such as teamwork, taking care of siblings, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and not having to be manly in the traditional sense. Disney dishes up its little morals so expertly, with a wink and joke, that we just drink them down like milkshake.</p> <p>As with everything, I struggled to rewatch Honey without making questionable comparisons to our current situation. Not to get excessively earnest about a movie charting the unique risks involved in constructing a machine that can without your knowledge reduce your children to the size of breadcrumbs, but it was striking how ultra-vulnerable these kids suddenly were, cowed by forces in nature far greater than them. Being human wasn\u2019t a power any more, it was a weakness. On this scale, an ant can have dominion. Of course, the kids befriend the ant, grow to love and respect it, and when the ant has a fight with a giant beetle and dies defending the kids from its attack, the bully kid breaks down in tears. Lessons learned: the bully was dependent on a fellow creature he\u2019d barely noticed before, and might even have stamped on. The very creature who protected him was the one to lose its life in the process. We have to look after each other to survive. We all lose creatures we love.</p> <p>Proudest parenting moment of lockdown so far? When the six-year-old requested to watch Honey, I Shrunk the Kids for a second time. If that is the peak of my home schooling efforts, which it undoubtedly is, I\u2019ll take it. As for this great parable for our age, well, a reboot is in the works \u2013 according to the film site IMDb, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11399224/\" title=\"\">Shrunk</a> is a thing. Who knows if it will happen, given that Disney has had to halt production on possibly higher-priority projects such as a live-action Little Mermaid and four Avatar sequels. But I have faith. By the time Shrunk gets made, we\u2019ll probably have rushed back to our old habits and humanity will be cruising to oblivion again. Or maybe Shrunk will appear just in time to remind us of our essential vulnerability and human co-dependency. It\u2019s possible, I realise, that I\u2019m overstating the future power of Shrunk, but you never know.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Deep in the bowels of Disney+, a clutch of self-serving documentaries reveal how drunk the company has become on its own myth over the years. The Imagineering Story (first episode: \u201cThe Happiest Place on Earth\u201d) tells us the story of Walt Disney, a father of two daughters who first drew Mickey Mouse on a train journey and based his first design for Disneyland on his hometown of Marceline, Missouri. We meet, too, the \u201cImagineers\u201d: people tasked with making new attractions at Disney\u2019s theme parks. \u201cCreating happiness is hard work,\u201d croons Angela Bassett in the voiceover. \u201cOnly a unique army of people is equipped to undertake such an enterprise. Since its inception, this merry band of misfits has defied the odds.\u201d Did she really just say \u201cthis merry band of misfits\u201d? Yes, she did.</p> <p>Another Disney-on-Disney documentary, called One Day at Disney<em>,</em> zooms in on a selection of employees, including Mark, who is almost moved to tears by his own life story \u2013 from being a train obsessive as a kid to running the steam train service at Disneyland, California. That\u2019s the way all the character arcs go in One Day at Disney, sculpted into the kind of perfect Disney shape that strongly resembles the now almost blackly comic notion of the American dream: I had a passion, I worked hard, my dream became a reality, and now the physical and emotional health of myself and my family, my entire life, really, is owned by a thumpingly profitable corporation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4fa8e53c0f47bd2922bba323cfb1a529c4e80b1c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fa8e53c0f47bd2922bba323cfb1a529c4e80b1c/0_293_3218_1930/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Disney CEO Bob Iger at Mickey Mouse\u2019s 90th anniversary celebration in Los Angeles in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Disney CEO Bob Iger at Mickey Mouse\u2019s 90th anniversary celebration in Los Angeles in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alberto E Rodr\u00edguez/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All the Disney documentaries feature Bob Iger, Disney\u2019s outgoing CEO, who likes to tell his own neatly crafted story, from how he started out 45 years ago earning $150 a week at ABC before rising to the top through sheer hard work and optimism. Iger always appears grandfatherly, in cable-knit sweaters and cosy cardigans, with deep grooves that fan out round his eyes gained by years of smiling in the service of corporate warmth. He often says things like: <strong>\u201c</strong>We\u2019re all trying to do the same thing, in very compelling ways: we\u2019re trying to touch people\u2019s hearts.\u201d</p> <p>During Iger\u2019s reign, Disney has become the entertainment behemoth of our age, acquiring Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm (and thus Star Wars) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/20/disney-seals-71bn-deal-for-21st-century-fox-as-it-prepares-to-take-on-netflix\" title=\"\">21st Century Fox</a> among others. The company now owns so much of the entertainment landscape that it can function like surround sound. There have been strings of mega-hits: last year alone included Toy Story 4, Avengers: Endgame, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Frozen 2 contributing to a total <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/22/walt-disney-stable-of-heroes-dominate-box-office-galaxy\" title=\"\">box office haul</a> of $11bn. Iger has been vastly rewarded for his efforts: in 2019, he earned $48m. The year before, he earned $65.7m, more than 1,000 times the median salary \u2013 about $46,000 \u2013 of all Disney employees. Many of Disney\u2019s workers, like those who filed a <a href=\"https://www.classaction.org/news/class-action-claims-disney-failed-to-pay-employees-anaheims-15-per-hour-living-minimum-wage\" title=\"\">class action lawsuit</a> in California\u2019s superior court last December, earn less than $15 an hour.</p> <p>The triumphant launch of Disney+ was supposed to be Iger\u2019s closing flourish, a final high-five as he left the building. The early signs were good. Pre-launch, Disney had established a target of 60 to 90 million subscribers by 2024. On 9 April 2020, the company announced it had already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/09/disney-netflix-rival-doubles-subscriptions-in-virus-lockdown\" title=\"\">hit 50 million</a>. (It took Netflix seven years to reach that point.) As Iger\u2019s retirement approached, there was persistent chatter in the media about him running for president, rumours he eventually had to <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/09/bob-iger-disney-president-politics-1202744699/\" title=\"\">deny</a> publicly. But just as his character journey was coming to its satisfying close, the story changed. By late March, most of Disney\u2019s operations were suspended due to coronavirus. Disney had <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/arielshapiro/2020/03/19/disney-debt-coronavirus-disneyland-mulan-marvel/\" title=\"\">lost a third</a> of its market value, $78.5bn, in the space of a month. Iger wasn\u2019t going anywhere, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/13/disney-bob-iger-to-stay-as-ceo-during-coronavirus-pandemic\" title=\"\">staying on</a> to help his successor, Bob Chapek.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"711817c1237312589f68222496badb0c9868aafe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/711817c1237312589f68222496badb0c9868aafe/0_93_4519_2712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Disney World in Florida closed and empty due to the coronavirus pandemic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Disney World in Florida closed and empty due to the coronavirus pandemic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Menendez/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the long run, unlike many of its employees, thousands of whom <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/business/disney-furloughs-coronavirus.html\" title=\"\">have been furloughed</a>, Disney itself will be just fine. Rightly, the company isn\u2019t high on anyone\u2019s worry list. But it\u2019s striking how far the current reality of Disney is from its well tended corporate image. In late March, various news outlets <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/disney-world-empty-coronavirus_n_5e7b618bc5b6dc206c4a8f08?ri18n=true\" title=\"\">published pictures</a> of Disney\u2019s closed theme parks \u2013 empty car parks, rollercoasters, cafes, golf courses and a lonely-looking Millennium Falcon at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2019/may/30/star-wars-galaxys-edge-disneys-new-theme-park-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Star Wars: Galaxy\u2019s Edge</a>. The photographs are somehow more sinister than those of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/mar/23/coronavirus-us-cities-quarantine-in-pictures\" title=\"\">empty cities</a> that have been doing the rounds. Cities, at the best of times, are conflicted and messy, beautiful and cruel. They rarely pretend to be anything they\u2019re not, unless there\u2019s an Olympics going on.</p> <p>Disney, on the other hand, is always pretending to be something it\u2019s not: it is a highly efficient profit machine that presents itself as a place where a merry band of misfits conjure happiness. Its theme parks are places constructed for children and commerce, and the optimised interplay of those two things, but in these images they look ghostly, frozen in time like the cursed inhabitants of the castle in Sleeping Beauty, still technically in existence but, in the absence of anything animate, turned into the lifeless sets of a horror movie. I doubt, somehow, that this is what Disney\u2019s \u201cImagineers\u201d had in mind.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>On some days, when we\u2019ve been outside in the weird quiet and heard only birds and sirens, the line between fantasy and reality feels pretty blurred. The world doesn\u2019t look real; something to do with the clean sunlight, the blossom, the way everyone walks around under a glaze of heightened self-awareness. There is deceptive peace, when we know, just around the corner, there is the opposite. We lurch between learning of the cruellest of realities, and feasting on fantasy to distract ourselves. Sometimes, emerging from a Disney haze, I wish I\u2019d stayed in the hard reality, because then at least you don\u2019t have to wake up from it.</p> <p>Kids are instructive, somehow able to navigate this time with a bracing honesty that adults nervously evade. There are ups and downs, sure: there are escape fantasies and berserk, semi-violent frustrations born of unchanging close-quarters proximity, but then they seem able to reset. Snacks help. So do lavatorial jokes. Or some sort of half-arsed slide made out of sofa cushions. A mood can descend and then pass like a rain shower, rather than descend and fester, which seems to be their parents\u2019 preference.</p> <p>The kids seem to have an appropriate amount of curiosity about bad news \u2013 a curiosity that knows when to move on to fresh ground instead of feeding itself with extraneous and panic-inducing information. When a situation is explained, they ask questions, listen to maybe 10% of the answers before becoming deeply bored by the sanctimonious tone of my voice, and then wander off, rather than spending the next eight hours scrolling through Twitter looking for fresh and conflicting perspectives about PPE provision and the precise timing of different nations\u2019 lockdown strategies until they can\u2019t sleep and want to go out on the empty streets and rage at the perfect moon. They are very, very frank about death. Before the schools closed, my daughter came home one day and told me it was unlikely she\u2019d die from coronavirus as she was a child, \u201cbut old people might\u201d. \u201cYes,\u201d I said, grateful for her direct approach to the subject, \u201cthey might.\u201d</p> <p>Also, distraction isn\u2019t distraction for them: it\u2019s occupation, it\u2019s <em>life</em>. When I interrupt the three-year-old in one of his deep-play sessions, something to do with small figures either warring or performing intricate stunts on Lego motorbikes, he looks at me sternly and says: \u201cI\u2019m <em>busy</em>.\u201d Meanwhile, the disapproving label of \u201cscreen time\u201d does a gross injustice to the six-year-old\u2019s capacity to immerse herself in a film. Watching her watching Bolt for the seventh time is like watching an athlete, a formidable effort of concentration that blocks out all external noise, attempts at conversation, offers of food.</p> <p>Disney+, inevitably, stole her heart. I could tell it from the moment I saw her face during that opening ident \u2013 the shooting star over the Disney castle, the background sky sunset-pink. They know what they\u2019re doing, these people: even the branding gives you an endorphin hit. During that seventh Bolt viewing, I realised why the kids wanted to keep watching the same movie over and over again. There\u2019s the expert appreciation for a fine piece of computer animation, no doubt, but there\u2019s also the deep comfort to be found in repeat viewing. Even multiple screenings in, they both covered their eyes in terror during a chase scene. The fear was real, but it was that pleasurable kind of fear you know will pass. There\u2019s no uncertainty, no risk. You know, for a fact, that everything will be OK. It\u2019s fear with a happy ending.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/26/game-of-thrones-the-crown-nina-gold-casting-director\">From Game of Thrones to The Crown: the woman who turns actors into stars</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some sad, jaded part of me wanted to point out to my kids the degree to which life, especially right now, is not at all like a Disney movie.

We could watch, godlike, in the safety of foreknowledge. At the movie\u2019s dramatic climax \u2013 spoiler alert \u2013 when Bolt rescues his beloved owner from a raging fire and they both fall unconscious, my daughter turned to me and said reassuringly, with the wisdom of hard-won experience and the beautiful relief of knowing the future: \u201cIt\u2019s OK.

And not only did we catch it, we are now the king of ventilators all over the world.<br><br>\u201cWe have thousands being made a week and they\u2019re very high quality and that wasn\u2019t playing well, so then they said, \u2018Testing, testing, ah, we\u2019ll get him on testing\u2019. Well, testing is much easier than ventilators.\u201d<br><br>In fact governors\u2019 demands for ventilators were based on the White House\u2019s own projections and, far from being new, their pleas for testing go back many weeks. Trump\u2019s words are also unlikely to comfort the afflicted for whom a ventilator is a lifeline.<br><br>Later at Monday\u2019s briefing, the president\u2019s ability to show empathy was again in question. </p> \n  <p>Yamiche Alcindor of PBS News recalled one of her interviewees: \u201cA man said his entire family got sick because they listened to you and didn\u2019t stay home. Are you concerned that downplaying the virus got people sick?\u201d<br><br>Trump\u2019s stunning reply: \u201cA lot of people love Trump, right. A lot of people love me, you see them all the time, right. I guess I\u2019m here for a reason. To the best of my knowledge, I won, and I think we\u2019re gonna win again. I think we\u2019re gonna win in a landslide.\u201d<br><br>The president went on to tout his travel restrictions on China, adding that \u201cbefore March\u201d he also banned travel from Europe (it was in fact announced on 11 March). The back and forth continued. Trump asserted: \u201cI haven\u2019t left the White House in months except for a brief moment to give a wonderful ship, the Comfort \u2013\u201d<br><br>Alcindor interjected, accurately: \u201cYou held a rally in March.\u201d<br><br>Caught red-handed, the president said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. Did I hold a rally? I\u2019m sorry, I hold a rally. Did I hold a rally?\u201d<br><br>For a moment, the illusionist\u2019s mask had slipped.

And initially, the restrictions didn\u2019t apply to the UK and Ireland, as well as most Eastern European countries.</p> \n  <p>Epidemiologists have told the Guardian that these policies likely had little impact, as they were enacted after the virus was already spreading within the US.\u201cUnfortunately, travel bans sound good,\u201d noted Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at Harvard\u2019s TH Chan School of Public Health, after Trump announced European restrictions. \u201cBut we\u2019re way past the point where simply restricting travel is a reasonable response.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The few studies so far that have investigated the impact of travel restrictions have found that such policies may have at best delayed the spread of disease by a few days or weeks. A recent article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/117/13/7504\">found</a> that travel restrictions and airport screenings in several countries \u201clikely slowed the rate of exportation from mainland China to other countries, but are insufficient to contain the global spread of COVID-19. And in China, where officials shut down travel both in and out of Wuhan, the city where the Covid-19 outbreak began, the travel ban barely slowed the spread of diseases, according to a report published in Science.</p> \n  <p>But there is no evidence that travel restrictions ultimately stopped the spread of coronavirus, or significantly reduced the contagion\u2019s death toll. </p> \n  <p>Read more: </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/trump-coronavirus-travel-ban-europe-us\">Will Trump's coronavirus travel ban work?

The estimates vary depending on the number, speed, and severity of infections, of course, but even the availability of testing affects the number of ventilators needed.... current estimates of the number of ventilators in the United States range from 60,000 to 160,000, depending on whether those that have only partial functionality are included. The national strategic reserve of ventilators is small and far from sufficient for the projected gap. No matter which estimate we use, there are not enough ventilators for patients with Covid-19 in the upcoming months.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Read more: </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/27/trump-ventilators-coronavirus-cuomo-new-york\">Trump on urgent requests for ventilators: 'I don't believe you need 30,000'</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9e17f68f0895b8b2283219\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-20T21:50:19.242Z\">10.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Fact check: Andrew Cuomo's comments</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Trump said New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, is coming to the White House tomorrow, and also implied Cuomo praised him today and that states like New York have the supplies they need. </p> \n  <p>The governor of New York, however, said in a late March briefing that the Trump administration had forced the states into a bidding war: \u201cYou have 50 states competing to buy the same item,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe all wind up bidding up each other and competing against each other, where you now literally will have a company call you up and say, \u2018Well, California just outbid you.\u2019 It\u2019s like being on eBay with 50 other states, bidding on a ventilator.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Yesterday, Trump played misleading clips of a Cuomo press conference:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/trump-plays-misleading-clips-of-support-from-cuomo-at-coronavirus-briefing\">Trump plays misleading clips of 'support' from Cuomo at coronavirus briefing</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9e173a8f08ce473efe2a23\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-20T21:45:09.349Z\">10.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Fact check: Death rate</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Trump claimed at the start of the press conference that the coronavirus death rate was better in the US than many other places in the world. </p> \n  <p>While the death rates in the US, both in comparison to the number of confirmed cases and in comparison to the population, are relatively good, they are not the best in the world (as Trump has said several times at recent briefings), based on the most reliable available data - which even experts agree may not be all that reliable. </p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality\">Research</a> by the US\u2019s Johns Hopkins University showed that as of April 13, the death rate in the US was 4% of cases and 6.73 deaths per 100,000 population. That is significantly better than rates in hard hit countries such as Italy, Spain, the UK and France, and similar overall to Iran, which was also an early hotspot. But death rates are higher in the US than Germany, South Korea, Japan, Australia, and many other countries. </p> \n  <p>The death rate in China had been recorded as 4% of cases and 0.2 deaths per 100,000 population. That was before the Chinese government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/china-denies-cover-up-as-wuhan-coronavirus-deaths-revised-up-50\">increased</a> the official death toll from Wuhan, the original base of the outbreak, by 50%. And there are ongoing questions about all of China\u2019s reported numbers in relation to the coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>Meanwhile, the New York Times has published a long and useful <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/us/coronavirus-death-rate.html\">article</a> detailing the enormous difficulties in pinpointing death rates in different countries and even different areas and populations within countries.</p> \n  <p>The virus swept in so quickly and is still so relatively new that we are only now grasping that there may be huge numbers of people who have or had Covid-19 without showing symptoms, have not been tested or who died at home or in a care home without that death ever being verified as resulting from coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>The New York Times gives a rough rule of thumb that, according to various unofficial Covid-19 trackers that calculate the death rate by dividing total deaths by the <a href=\"https://qap.ecdc.europa.eu/public/extensions/COVID-19/COVID-19.html\">number of known cases</a>, about 6.4% of people infected with the virus have now died worldwide. But it adds that \u201chealth officials and epidemiologists have estimated there are five to 10 people with infections for every confirmed case in some communities, and at least one estimate suggests there are far more\u201d.</p> \n  <p>So ultimately the worldwide death rate, if it can ever be verified, is likely to be a much, much lower number than currently understood. And data for the US and other countries could change a lot going forward.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-20T22:03:43.249Z\">at 11.03pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9e15c48f0895b8b228320d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-20T21:41:00.495Z\">10.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Trump press conference begins</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The president is at the podium now, talking about his guidelines for reopening the country. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9e148d8f08ce473efe2a17\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-20T21:35:20.852Z\">10.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Joe Biden gets progressive House endorsements</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>While we wait for the White House briefing to begin, here\u2019s some quick non-coronavirus news: a number of former Bernie Sanders\u2019 supporters in Congress have officially endorsed Joe Biden: </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/cmarinucci/status/1252295568086335490\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">New!
