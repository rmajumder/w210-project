However, with 84% of today\u2019s 1,032 new cases and 67% of the national total located in the capital, the health minister <strong>Jaime Ma\u00f1alich</strong> has taken to referring ominously to the situation as the \u201cbattle for Santiago\u201d.</p> \n  <p>According to official statistics released by the health ministry, Chile had largely kept its epidemic under control. However, the country now has 23,048 confirmed cases and 281 people have died having tested positive.</p> \n  <p>Chile has maintained the highest level of testing in Latin America with more than 230,000 tests carried out. And the government has suggested an increase in testing could have contributed to the recent uptick in cases.</p> \n  <p>But the pandemic has also pushed out of the wealthier western suburbs of Santiago into more deprived, poorer-equipped areas of the capital. And the government has announced that 12 more districts will go into quarantine from Friday as part of its \u201cdynamic\u201d approach to enforcing and lifting lockdowns.</p> \n  <p>Checkpoints will also be set up around the nearby coastal cities of Vi\u00f1a del Mar and Valpara\u00edso \u2013 the country\u2019s second-largest population centre \u2013 where cases are currently far lower than in the capital.</p> \n  <p>Amid the rise in cases, the government has also softened its rhetoric with regard to a passport-style scheme that it had said would certify \u201cimmunity\u201d. A WHO directive has since urged caution regarding such policies.</p> \n  <p>Nonetheless, the government has said the first cards will be issued on Friday, although they will simply confirm that a person has tested positive for the virus, not that they are immune.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T18:49:32.198Z\">at 7.49pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb3011f8f08597eeb1b7403\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T18:42:03.149Z\">7.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Iceland has all but eliminated the virus as 97% of infected patients have recovered and only two new cases have been confirmed in the last week, the country\u2019s chief epidemiologist <strong>Thorolfur Gudnason</strong> has said.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have been pleasantly surprised to see a very fast deceleration of the pandemic in Iceland.

That suggests that the virus was already being transmitted extensively around the globe from early on in the epidemic. </p> \n  <p>Balloux said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>All viruses naturally mutate. Mutations in themselves are not a bad thing and there is nothing to suggest SARS-CoV-2 is mutating faster or slower than expected.</p> \n   <p>So far we cannot say whether SARS-CoV-2 is becoming more or less lethal and contagious.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Balloux said the 198 small genetic changes, or mutations, that the study identified appeared to have independently occurred more than once. </p> \n  <p>These may hold clues to how the virus is adapting and help in efforts to develop drugs and vaccines. Ballouz explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A major challenge to defeating viruses is that a vaccine or drug might no longer be effective if the virus has mutated. </p> \n   <p>If we focus our efforts on parts of the virus that are less likely to mutate, we have a better chance of developing drugs that will be effective in the long run.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The UCL team\u2019s findings, published on Wednesday in the journal Infection, Genetics and Evolution, confirm that the virus emerged in late 2019, Balloux said, before quickly spreading across the globe. </p> \n  <p>The study was not able to confirm the exact starting point or location. </p> \n  <p>A study by <strong>French scientists</strong> published earlier this week found <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/french-hospital-discovers-covid-19-case-december-retested\">a man there was infected with Covid-19 as early as 27 December</a>, nearly a month before France confirmed its first cases. <br></p> \n  <p> The <strong>World Health Organization</strong> said the French case was \u201cnot surprising\u201d and urged countries to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/who-seeks-early-coronavirus-cases-as-merkel-warns-over-german-lockdown\">investigate any other early suspicious cases</a>. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb2913a8f084fb5ab57d176\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T10:33:23.726Z\">11.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Twitter</strong> said it would tackle the spread of damaging conspiracy theories linking mobile phone technology and coronavirus with a prompt to direct people searching for 5G to British government-verified information. </p> \n  <p>The theory, which has spread on social media, has resulted in attacks on mobile telecoms masts and abuse directed at engineers in <strong>Britain</strong>. </p> \n  <p>Scientists, phone companies and the government have said it is completely untrue. </p> \n  <p>Twitter said the search prompt would inform users that the government had seen no link between 5G and Covid-19, and include a link to a government website with credible, factual and verified information in relation to 5G. </p> \n  <p>Katy Minshall, Twitter UK\u2019s head of government, public policy and philanthropy, said the move was the latest step in its focus on connecting people with authoritative information regarding Covid-19. </p> \n  <p>\u201cOur partnerships throughout this pandemic have allowed us to take proactive steps in bringing people the information most relevant and useful for them,\u201d she said. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e555962df387d1ecb97d8a5465f2d04a1df7d65c\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e555962df387d1ecb97d8a5465f2d04a1df7d65c/0_0_5568_3340/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A burned down mobile phone mast in London.

Also today, Nicola Sturgeon told Holyrood her government would start to lift restrictions \u201cas soon as possible\u201d, after the latest data showed coronavirus-related deaths in Scotland fell for the first time, and the Welsh government said it expected a \u201ccareful and cautious approach\u201d to relaxing the lockdown from Westminster.<strong> <br></strong></li> \n   <li><strong>Rishi Sunak is preparing to wind down the job retention scheme from July as the government plans to gradually remove lockdown measures.</strong> A decision is yet to be made, but the Treasury is understood to be examining several options for tapering the scheme, including cutting the 80% wage subsidy to 60% and lowering the \u00a32,500 cap on monthly payments. Another option promoted by employers\u2019 groups to allow furloughed staff to work, but with a smaller state subsidy, is also under consideration.</li> \n   <li><strong>The official UK coronavirus death toll passed 30,000 as another 649 fatalities were recorded.</strong> The new total of 30,076 represents the number of people who have tested positive for Covid-19 and died, so the true number will be much higher.</li> \n   <li><strong>Heathrow airport is to begin temperature screening of passengers in an effort to minimise transmission across borders.</strong> The airport\u2019s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said it would trial technologies and processes that could form the basis of a common international standard for health screening at airports, including cameras in immigration halls.</li> \n   <li><strong>No 10 scaled down the scope of the PM\u2019s new \u201c200,000 tests per day\u201d target as the government missed its 100,000 daily tests goal for a fourth day running.</strong> The PM\u2019s spokesman said that when Johnson set the new testing target for the end of May during PMQs, he had been referring to testing capacity. Later, Robert Jenrick told the daily press briefing that 69,463 tests were carried out yesterday.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Rising levels of racism towards people of east Asian heritage have left many feeling too scared to venture out when the lockdown is eventually lifted, research suggests. </strong>The survey by Prof Binna Kandola found that just over half of respondents had experienced an increase in discrimination since the pandemic began, with Chinese people reporting being coughed at, attacked, mocked and abused. Kandola said society had an opportunity to show zero tolerance towards racist behaviour once the lockdown is eased.</li> \n   <li><strong>The tube will only be able to run at 20% capacity to allow for physical distancing, Sadiq Khan said.</strong> The mayor of London said the transport system could not operate at pre-crisis levels while maintaining physical distancing at all times, so capacity would have to be reduced to 13-20% and the carrying capacity of double-decker buses could be reduced from 85 to 15 passengers. He argued that everyone in London who could work from home would have to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. </li> \n   <li><strong>And police decided not to take action against Prof Neil Ferguson after he breached lockdown rules.</strong> The scientist resigned last night after it emerged that he had broken lockdown restrictions by receiving visits from his lover. This morning the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said it was right that he had stepped down and backed any action the police decided to take. However, Scotland Yard said that since Ferguson had accepted responsibility for his error of judgment, no further action would be taken. Downing Street confirmed Ferguson would no longer be advising the government in any way.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s it from us on the UK side for today.

Some new research from the Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases (CMMID) at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine suggests that the figure may be much higher than people assume.</p> \n  <p>The researchers looked at data from the coronavirus outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, where eventually 80% of passengers and staff were tested. Combining this data with information with data about when people developed symptoms, and modelling showing how the virus would have spread, the team estimated that 72% of people on the ship infected with the virus remained asymptomatic.</p> \n  <p>The research has not been peer-reviewed, but there is a preliminary outline <a href=\"https://cmmid.github.io/topics/covid19/asymp-transmission.html\">here</a>, and a press release <a href=\"https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/newsevents/news/2020/almost-75-people-board-diamond-princess-covid-19-may-have-been-asymptomatic\">here</a>. Here\u2019s an extract.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The research team estimated that 72% of people infected with Covid-19 onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship remained asymptomatic. For each asymptomatic case, it remained uncertain how infectious they were although they were unlikely to be as infectious as a symptomatic case.</p> \n   <p>Overall, the team estimate that asymptomatic cases were responsible for 11-84% of all infections during the outbreak. Work will be extended with more data (where available) and to other outbreaks, which the team hopes will enable more accurate estimates of the impact of asymptomatic cases on all infections over the coming period.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Rein Houben from the CMMID, who led the research, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We know that a substantial number of people infected with the coronavirus are asymptomatic, and there is anecdotal evidence that this group can transmit the virus, However, there are few reliable estimates on the proportion of people with Covid-19 who don\u2019t show symptoms, and their overall contribution to the spread of the virus.</p> \n   <p>This information is crucial for health policymakers to develop the most effective response strategies, including exiting from lockdowns.

Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The prime minister\u2019s spokesman signalled that cabinet and Cobra, the government\u2019s emergency committee, will meet at the weekend to agree the plan to start easing the lockdown</strong>. The cabinet will meet, as usual, tomorrow. But the spokesman also said that it was \u201centirely possible\u201d that cabinet would meet at the weekend. And he indicated that Cobra, the committee that includes representatives of the devolved administrations, would also meet shortly before the announcement gets made by Boris Johnson on Sunday. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman refused to comment on reports suggesting that the government may abandon its \u201cStay home\u201d slogan at the weekend, replacing it with another message consistent with the lockdown starting to ease.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said that, when Boris Johnson set a new testing target in the Commons of 200,000 tests by the end of May (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/may/06/uk-coronavirus-live-furlough-scheme-government-ease-lockdown-pmqs-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5eb29b558f084fb5ab57d22f#block-5eb29b558f084fb5ab57d22f\">12.12pm)</a>, the target applied to testing capacity</strong>.

But the spokesman said the actual target referred to by Johnson at PMQs this afternoon just covered capacity, not actual tests. In recent weeks daily capacity for testing almost always been significantly higher than the number of tests actually carried out. The spokesman said the target also covered antibody testing, which looks at whether people have had the virus, as well as the antigen testing, which looks at whether people have the virus. The current figures only cover antigen testing because a reliable antibody test for use at home is not yet available.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said Prof Neil Ferguson would no longer be advising the government in any way.</strong> But he said that others from Imperial College contribute to Sage, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. The spokesman said that the government wanted Imperial\u2019s \u201cinvaluable work\u201d to continue to be available to it. The spokesman also said that Johnson thought Ferguson had taken the right decision to resign from Sage, and that the social distancing rules were there for a purpose.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman dismissed suggestions that Ferguson\u2019s resignation exposed double standards over the social distancing rules.</strong> There have been claims that Robert Jenrick, the housing secretary, and Johnson himself have both broken these rules, because <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/04/10/robert-jenrick-pressure-quit-claim-mansion-family-home-called/\">Jenrick left London with his family to stay in a home in the country</a>, and Johnson and his fiancee stayed at Chequers after Johnson come out of hospital. The spokesman said that Jenrick was just travelling to rejoin his family, and that Johnson went to Chequers on the advice of his doctors.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said that when Johnson spoke at PMQs about a a \u201cpalpable improvement\u201d in care homes, he was referring to death rates falling.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Jenrick, the housing secretary, will take this afternoon\u2019s press conference, the spokesman said.</strong> Prof Yvonne Doyle, the medical director of Public Health England, and Nikki Kanani, the medical director of NHS England, will also be appearing. The questions at the press conference are being allocated to regional newspapers, not national newspapers.

But, of course, there is no chance of PMQs resuming its shouting match status any time soon (one of the few benefits of this ghastly crisis) and instead Boris Johnson was left looking exposed and diminished as he faced Sir Keir Starmer for the first time.</p> \n  <p>As had been widely expected, Starmer was impressive \u2013 focused, calm, and rational. His interventions today were crisper than in his previous two outings (probably an improvement), and he always ended with a very direct question, simple yet incriminating. No doubt he could manage in a rowdy Commons, but the courtroom silence seems to suit him better, and the overall impression left by the encounter was of a rather floundering prime minister struggling to respond to a full-on grown-up channelling the questions a critical nation wants answering.</p> \n  <p>Another difficulty for the PM in Zoom PMQs is that he can\u2019t pick the brains of the specialist minister sitting alongside him. Prime ministers are normally more reliant on prompts from colleagues at PMQs than people realise, and Johnson looked particular in need of verbal assistance from Matt Hancock when asked about PPE.</p> \n  <p>In normal PMQs a struggling PM would resort to sloganising, and hope the backbench noise machine might do the rest, but with that no longer an option it did seem as if Johnson was more reliant on making points of substance. He could not answer Starmer\u2019s questions easily (they were designed to be hard to answer \u2013 at least, hard to answer without admitting gross negligence), but he did show some leg on a public inquiry, and provide a relatively revealing answer about why he is making the lockdown announcement on Sunday.</p> \n  <p>Starmer will be pleased with how the exchanges went. But if the new format militates against sloganising, then that is potentially a problem for the leader of the opposition too. At his first PMQs against Tony Blair, David Cameron came out with the memorable line about <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1504993/You-were-the-future-once.html\">how Blair \u201cwas the future once\u201d</a> \u2013 a soundbite and a slogan, but a good one, that defined Cameron successfully. A week today, we will remember that Starmer looked the part at his first PMQs, but we are less likely to remember what he actually said.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7f096d5dac89cbce07220f508fc55079de8dfdd\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7f096d5dac89cbce07220f508fc55079de8dfdd/0_110_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson speaking at PMQs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson speaking at PMQs.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Taylor/UK PARLIAMENT/EPA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T15:25:22.222Z\">at 4.25pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb2a8438f0898654cef9874\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T12:06:38.336Z\">1.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54809a4eec44f2ab805f5141829adbb3098cc936\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54809a4eec44f2ab805f5141829adbb3098cc936/0_0_3500_2313/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Larry the cat sits in front of 10 Downing Street.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Larry the cat sits in front of 10 Downing Street.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb2a69e8f0898654cef9856\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/severincarrell\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T12:00:50.043Z\">1.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The proportion of all Scottish coronavirus deaths happening in care homes rose to 59% last week, up from 52% the week before, adding to the sense of crisis in the sector.</p> \n  <p><strong> National Records of Scotland</strong>, the government agency, said that deaths overall from Covid-19 had declined week on week for the first time since the outbreak began, with 523 deaths relating to the virus recorded in the week ending 3 May (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/may/06/uk-coronavirus-live-furlough-scheme-government-ease-lockdown-pmqs-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5eb29d6e8f0898654cef97ad#block-5eb29d6e8f0898654cef97ad\">12.22.</a>).</p> \n  <p>That was a fall of 135 from the previous week, with the data including deaths in all settings, including hospitals, homes and other places.

And double decker buses could end up carrying just 15 passengers, he says.</p> \n  <p>Here is an extract.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s an inescapable fact that no mass transport system of the scale we have in London can operate at full capacity while maintaining social distancing at all times. Even with Tube ridership standing at just five per cent at the moment, there are times when passengers struggle to keep their distance. </p> \n   <p>This means that if the social distancing requirements remain in place, the total carrying capacity of the Tube will have to be reduced to between 13 to 20 per cent of pre-crisis levels \u2013 even with close to 100 per cent of trains running. We will also need to have a fundamentally different approach to operating stations, with strict queuing systems to limit the number of people who can access the network at any one time. Certain major stations where TfL and National Rail services interchange are likely to present the biggest challenge.</p> \n   <p>Likewise, there will need to be big changes to how we run the bus network. The carrying capacity of double decker buses could be reduced from 85 passengers to just 15. During the lockdown, we have been encouraging social distance queuing at some of our 21,500 bus stops by putting markings on the pavement. But this system will not be possible to maintain when passenger numbers start to increase. We are looking at possible solutions and have already started working with London boroughs to widen pavement space in key locations to alleviate the pressure. However, it will still be impossible to maintain social distance if passenger numbers increase even modestly.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>One consequence of this, Khan argues, is that in London \u201ceveryone who can work from home will have to be told to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb293048f0898654cef96e8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T10:42:27.872Z\">11.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Chinese in Britain 'too scared to venture out alone' amid rising levels of anti-Asian racism</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Rising levels of racist abuse that forced people of Chinese heritage to withdraw from UK society before the lockdown are likely to escalate when it lifts, an academic has warned.</p> \n  <p>Chinese people have been coughed at, attacked and told to \u201cgo back home\u201d, according to research led by Prof Binna Kandola.

Another family withdrew their four-year-old boy from a football club after other parents told their children not to stand close to him. One respondent told Kandola:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Nearly every British-born Chinese person I\u2019ve spoken to is genuinely very shocked about what has happened. They are British, have lived all their lives in Britain and yet they feel like outsiders now.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Prof Kandola said society has an opportunity to show zero tolerance towards racist behaviour when the UK eases lockdown measures. Condemnation from leading politicians and the media would help those affected feel like they are being listened to, he said, while also suggesting local authorities direct victims of abuse to helplines or support groups. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There\u2019s a role for all of us to keep our eyes and ears open about what is going on around us and, when we see it, to intervene.</p> \n   <p>We are actually better than this. As a nation we are better than this.</p> \n   <p>And there are a lot of people in this country who will be shocked about what is going on, and will do something about it.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T10:53:15.648Z\">at 11.53am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb2929a8f0898654cef96dd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T10:34:36.720Z\">11.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"edf44dd9c1828ed4ea750d32298f009b98d57048\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edf44dd9c1828ed4ea750d32298f009b98d57048/0_155_4733_2839/1000.jpg\" alt=\"PPE supplies arrive at Bournemouth International Airport from Kuala Lumpur.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">PPE supplies arrive at Bournemouth international airport from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Finnbarr Webster/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T10:45:37.736Z\">at 11.45am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb287b98f082f9b4099b2b0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T10:29:42.773Z\">11.29am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Hancock's Q&amp;A on Sky News - Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here are some more lines from <strong>Matt Hancock</strong>\u2019s Q&amp;A on Sky News. I have already posted on what he said about Prof Neil Ferguson.

Asked about this data, Hancock said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think we\u2019ve got to be very cautious with these data. I think we\u2019ve got to be really careful in how we describe it, because you\u2019ve got to take a lot of things into account.</p> \n   <p>Firstly, we are one of the biggest countries in Europe and that matters, so there are smaller countries which naturally will have a lower death rate because they have got fewer people.</p> \n   <p>Spain and Italy, for instance, don\u2019t include deaths outside hospital in their figures. We didn\u2019t used to, because it is harder to count deaths in the community and in care homes, and we now do ...</p> \n   <p>If you talk to the statisticians and the chief medical officer, what they say is it\u2019s only afterwards, looking back and looking at the total number who have died during the peak, compared to the normal number - because you\u2019ve also got to take into account the age profile, factors like obesity.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>What Hancock is saying about Italy contracts what No 10 said <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/882243/2020-04-29_COVID-19_Press_Conference_Slides.pdf\">in a caption to one of the slides shown at the daily press conference on 29 April</a>.

That is right at the front of my mind.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He suggested that cafes may be able to open for customers sitting outside relatively soon.</strong> Asked by a viewer who wanted to know when their cafe could open, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The business secretary is working on the rules for safe working so, when we get the rate of new infections down, we can work on how people can get back to work as safely as possible. And we are going to say more about that very shortly.</p> \n   <p>There is strong evidence that outdoors the spread is much, much lower, so there may be workarounds that some businesses, for instance cafes, especially over the summer, may be able to put into place.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said it would too soon to say when schools would be allowed to open.</strong> Asked about this, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t know because we have to see the progress of the disease and we don\u2019t know how people are going to behave in terms of the lockdown measures which are the thing that have the biggest impact on getting the disease down.</p> \n   <p>I understand the frustration of people wanting to know the answer \u2013 will it be June, will it be September, for what age groups? We just don\u2019t yet have the data but I think we are coming to a position relatively soon.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hancock said the government could have explained the help available to care homes more effectively.</strong> Asked about problems with testing for people in care homes, Hancock said the government had to build the capacity for those tests to take place. Asked what he could have done differently, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think it\u2019s very hard. I feel like we\u2019ve put a huge amount of effort and resources behind supporting care homes from the start, maybe we should have explained that more clearly.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He claimed the UK was now a world leader on testing.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We invented the test in January. In February we got the number of tests up to 2,000 [a day]. In March we multiplied that by five times to 10,000. Then we set the 100,000 target.</p> \n   <p>The Germans started with this enormous diagnostics industry. But if you look at other countries around the world we are miles ahead on testing and we are now one of the world leaders.</p> \n   <p>It is true that Germany has a very high capacity \u2013 about the same as ours. So we have basically caught up with Germany that started with this massive capability. We are miles ahead of South Korea now.

Ian Hamilton, an expert in addiction and mental health from the University of York, who organised the letter, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is encouraging to see the Department of Health recognise the need to provide flexible arrangements for the supply and use of controlled drugs during the Covid pandemic. This is long overdue as some of the regulations place onerous restrictions on health care staff and pharmacists who are already stretched.</p> \n   <p>The re-use of medicine like morphine is a sensible and pragmatic move which will not only be welcomed by health care workers but has the potential to ensure unnecessary suffering is avoided, as patients who are in pain or experience severe breathlessness can be treated in a timely and safe way. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The call comes after the home secretary Priti Patel <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/letter-to-the-acmd-on-advice-on-emergency-legislation-to-enable-supply-of-controlled-drugs/letter-from-the-home-secretary-to-the-chair-of-the-advisory-council-on-the-misuse-of-drugs\">wrote to the Advisory Council for the Misuse of Drugs saying</a>: \u201cI must be clear that these measures will not come into use with immediate effect.

And he started by escalating the criticism of Prof Neil Ferguson, suggesting there could be a case for the police getting involved.</p> \n  <p>Asked by the presenter <strong>Kay Burley</strong> if Ferguson should be prosecuted for breaking the lockdown rules, Hancock replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>You can imagine what my views are.</p> \n   <p>It\u2019s a matter for the police. As a government minister, I\u2019m not allowed to get involved in the operational decisions of police matters. But I think that the social distancing rules are very important and should be followed.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Burley said that Dr Catherine Calderwood, the Scottish chief medical officer who resigned after it emerged she had visited her second home, had been issued with a warning by the police. Asked if he approved of what the police did in that situation, Hancock said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Absolutely I back the police. I back the Scottish police, I would back the police here. They will take their decisions independently from ministers, that\u2019s quite right. It\u2019s always been like that.</p> \n   <p>And that\u2019s why, even though I\u2019ve got a view as to what I think, as a minister the way we run the police is that they make their decisions like this. So I give them their space to make that decision. But I think he took the right decision to resign.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Hancock also said he was speechless when he heard what Ferguson had done. In his statement to the Daily Telegraph, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/05/exclusive-government-scientist-neil-ferguson-resigns-breaking/\">which broke the story</a>, Ferguson justified his decision to meet a lover who lived in another household on the grounds that he was acting on the basis that he was immune, because he had had coronavirus. But Hancock said that he had also had coronavirus and that he has specifically asked the chief medical officer if that meant he was at lower risk. Hancock said he had been told he still had to observe the social distancing rules.</p> \n  <p>Hancock could easily have dodged Burley\u2019s questions about police involvement, but he chose to answer in a way that clearly implied this was a case where the police might want to get involved.</p> \n  <p>However, in doing so, Hancock also suggested he is not fully familiar with the regulations imposing the lockdown rules on England - the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020, which Hancock himself introduced. These say that during the emergency period \u201cno person may leave the place where they are living without reasonable excuse\u201d.</p> \n  <p>But, according to the Telegraph story, Ferguson did not leave him house to see his lover. She came to visit him. There might be grounds for saying that she has broken the regulations, but not Ferguson.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"963772ac069d5ae89af0c53a00e3e2bd24561f6e\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/963772ac069d5ae89af0c53a00e3e2bd24561f6e/240_3_1487_892/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Hancock on Sky News with Kay Burley (left)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matt Hancock on Sky News with Kay Burley (left)</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: sky news</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T10:24:52.239Z\">at 11.24am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb27b6e8f085c470051f0da\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T09:05:05.916Z\">10.05am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Yesterday Downing Street told us that Boris Johnson has started taking a daily walk around St James\u2019s Park as part of his lockdown exercise regime.

A polarised politics has taken hold. It views the world through a prism of winners and losers and sees compromise and co-operation as signs of weakness. Lost is the idea that countries do better by working together to solve common problems, even if doing so sometimes means an apparent sacrifice of short-term benefit for the greater good. In its place is a cynical calculus: \u201cI\u2019m right and you\u2019re either with me or against me.\u201d This is the world that the pandemic hit.</p> \n   <p>A highly infectious novel virus, life-threatening for many, might seem to be just the sort of thing countries would want to work together on. Instead, it has been treated as a national issue for countries to deal with alone. Researchers and scientists may work together across the world but there is little evidence of politicians doing so ...</p> \n   <p>There remains no collective international view as to what works best in dealing with the virus \u2014 nor does there seem to have been any attempt to form one. This risks exacerbating the shift towards nationalism and absolutism which is emasculating the institutions that served us well over decades. A world in which a few \u201cstrong men\u201d square up to each other and expect everyone else to choose between them would be a dangerous one.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T08:20:16.148Z\">at 9.20am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb26c5f8f08da022712b4a6\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T07:53:12.222Z\">8.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Minister hints there will be inquiry into coronavirus, saying all governments will need to learn lessons</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>James Brokenshire</strong> has also been speaking on BBC Breakfast, and pushed on the <strong>UK\u2019s death toll</strong>, which is now the highest in Europe, Brokenshire said after the pandemic there will be a chance to see \u201cwhat mistakes have been made\u201d.</p> \n  <p>He told BBC Breakfast: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is an absolute tragedy for anyone to lose a loved one. And there will be, I\u2019m sure, plenty of reflection and time once we are through this terrible virus to be able to look at actions that have been taken and to see what lessons can be learned, what mistakes have been made. And every government I think will need to do that and we are no exception to that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The government has not yet confirmed that there will be a public inquiry into its handling of the coronavirus crisis once it is over, but Brokenshire\u2019s words may be the closest any minister has come to saying it\u2019s inevitable.</p> \n  <p>Asked the government\u2019s <strong>lockdown plans</strong>, Brokenshire said there is likely to be a \u201ccareful\u201d, \u201ccautious and thoughtful\u201d approach:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It does need to be done with that great care and thought, because the last thing that we need is another second surge, for the NHS to be overwhelmed and all of the issues that that would bring.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Pushed on <strong>testing</strong>, Brokenshire said the government decided to stop testing and tracing for coronavirus in the community on March 12 due to a \u201cshift\u201d in expert advice. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We\u2019ve always been informed by the expert advice in this. There was a shift in terms of how testing was done - we\u2019ve already heard about some of the issues of overall capacity at that point of time and some of the evidence that (Sir) Patrick Vallance, our chief scientific officer (sic), has given.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked whether, had there been the capacity, track-and-tracing should have continued, the Home Office minister said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Would there have been benefit in having that extra capacity, as Patrick Vallance highlighted in his evidence yesterday? Yes.</p> \n   <p>The challenge that we had was that we have some fantastic laboratories, some fantastic expertise, but it has been the capacity restraints that we have had, and therefore that has posed challenges, but also that has now been ramped up to go from 2,000 tests (per day) in February to 120,000 at the end of April.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Reminder: this is what the UK\u2019s chief scientific adviser<strong> Sir Patrick Vallance</strong> told the Commons Health Select Committee yesterday:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> I think that probably we, in the early phases, and I\u2019ve said this before, I think if we\u2019d managed to ramp testing capacity quicker it would have been beneficial.</p> \n   <p>And, you know, for all sorts of reasons that didn\u2019t happen.</p> \n   <p>I think it\u2019s clear you need lots of testing for this [but] it\u2019s completely wrong to think of testing as the answer.</p> \n   <p>It\u2019s just part of the system that you need to get right. The entire system needs to work properly.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Brokenshire defended the decision <strong>not to close UK borders</strong> in a bid to stop the virus spreading across the country, after Vallance said most of the coronavirus strains being spread across the UK in March came from people returning from Spain and Italy. Brokenshire said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think it is important to note that the scientific advice was very clear that, up to this point in time, placing restrictions at the border would not have had any significant impact on epidemic progression in the UK. </p> \n   <p>Sage looked at this on March 23 - the numbers coming from other countries were estimated to be insignificant compared with domestic cases, comprising around 0.5% of total cases at the time.</p> \n   <p>Since then, obviously, you\u2019ll be more than aware, with all of the issues in the aviation sector, how we\u2019ve seen a reduction in air passengers by around 99% since the start of the outbreak.</p> \n   <p>It is something we will continue to keep under review as we look to the next phase but, at that time, the advice was clear that placing restrictions would not have had any significant impact.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"001a1982ed967b47e55d3e2c3ac4610ccc8fdfa6\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/001a1982ed967b47e55d3e2c3ac4610ccc8fdfa6/0_116_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Brokenshire, the security minister.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Brokenshire, the security minister.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yui Mok/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T08:51:05.259Z\">at 9.51am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb26a948f085c470051f052\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T07:45:22.478Z\">8.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Prof Ferguson right to step down, says minister</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Security Minister <strong>James Brokenshire</strong> has called Prof Neil Ferguson\u2019s resignation a \u201cmatter of regret\u201d but an \u201cappropriate course\u201d of action.

He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are still very firmly discussing with the sector, with Public Health England and reaching out to ensure that capacity is reaching where it needs to be.</p> \n   <p>That work still continues. We are obviously concerned about issues in care homes, ensuring there is that reach - it is there in terms of the capacity, having gone up - and how we ensure we can get that further, where it is needed, given the whole point of investing in that was to ensure that it can give that sense of reassurance.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T08:44:12.819Z\">at 9.44am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb2662c8f085c470051f035\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T07:25:15.815Z\">8.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Will coronavirus spell the end of the party for Ibiza?</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/06/its-a-tough-island-to-live-on-why-coronavirus-spells-doom-for-ibiza\">'It's a tough island to live on': why coronavirus spells doom for Ibiza</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb263548f085c470051f02b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T07:14:36.202Z\">8.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>My colleague <strong>Steven Morris</strong> has this report on the name change of the <strong>national assembly of Wales</strong>:</p> \n  <p>There will be no fanfare and little ceremony but the body formerly known as the national assembly of Wales has a new name.</p> \n  <p>From now it will be known as Senedd Cymru \u2013 the Welsh parliament.

  "<p>Look, to be honest with you, if I\u2019m in need of a good laugh from the internet I\u2019m most likely to Google \u201cfunny falls compilation\u201d and that will scratch the itch just fine. There\u2019s <em>nothing</em> funnier than people falling over and yes, that is a statement I will stand by in court.

It was just like #MeAt20, only it was in 2018 and aimed at people who did after-school drama. A version of the \u201clook at me when I was young. No look at ME when <em>I</em> was young. Stop it! No YOU\u2019RE the prettiest\u201d meme, it can be traced back to 2006\u2019s #tbt, and shares etymological roots with offshoots such as 2010\u2019s Facebook Doppelganger week.

Dear Sister</h2> <p>This week I also revisited the Saturday Night Live digital short Dear Sister. A seminal work.</p> <p>It\u2019s technically a parody of a scene from The OC, but that\u2019s not really the point. Like most funny things, it\u2019s pointless to try to explain why this is funny, which is also sort of the point. A gem from that excellent era of SNL when The Lonely Island went rogue with digital shorts (see also: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=311tHNMwf88\">Sloths</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRhTeaa_B98\">Lazy Sunday</a>, and if you want to go even further back, to pre-SNL Lonely Island, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt2OVAgkHBc\">Just 2 Guyz</a>).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmd1qMN5Yo0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vmd1qMN5Yo0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Dear Sister found its way into my feed because it has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/scifibis/status/1249734663330885632?s=21\">just turned 13 years old</a>, which is absolutely horrifying.

I am obsessed with everything Daisy Edgar-Jones wears on screen for the whole, blissful 12 episodes. The spaghetti strap sundress she wears for an afternoon bike ride and an ice-cream in an Italian piazza is surely the most delicious ballerina-length black dress since the bare-shouldered satin cocktail dress with the bateau-neckline and the bow-tied shoulders Hubert de Givenchy made for Audrey Hepburn in the film Sabrina in 1954. (A dress so iconic that it is known as the \u201c<a href=\"https://alisonkerr.wordpress.com/2011/03/20/style-on-film-sabrina/\">Sabrina dress</a>\u201d. )</p> <p>Then there is the short A-line tunic in sun-faded gingham Marianne wears by the pool in another scene from that Trieste holiday. With her lush fringe and coltish beauty, the vibe is pure Jane Birkin circa 1969. And the yellow sleeveless blouse in which she bolts in late to the school exam hall, when everyone else is in uniform. And don\u2019t get my started on the cream V-neck blouse with the black silk scarf and the dangling shell earrings.</p> <p>Normal People is not about clothes. Indeed, lots of the very best bits of Normal People are the scenes where Marianne and Connell have no clothes on at all. But I think we all know by now that Marianne\u2019s sweaty sex hair and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/04/normal-people-connell-chain-reaction-unbridled-lust\">Connell\u2019s chain</a> are iconic, so I will spare you more thigh-rubbing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1db30f6d0771a2f54b2cd14bd690916c26438707\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1db30f6d0771a2f54b2cd14bd690916c26438707/202_0_629_629/500.jpg\" alt=\"Normal People\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cream V-neck blouse with the black silk scarf and the dangling shell earrings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Normal People</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Maybe it is a marker of how good Normal People is that it not about clothes and yet the clothes are still brilliant. Or maybe it\u2019s because Normal People is not about clothes that the clothes are brilliant. When television makes noise in fashion it is usually for cutting-edge, scene-stealing looks by of-the-moment designers: Villanelle wearing The Vampire\u2019s Wife in the new season of Killing Eve, say. But this show\u2019s Emmy-nominated costume designer, Lorna Marie Mugan, whose previous credits include the stylish and very influential Peaky Blinders, dressed Marianne in a mix of high street and vintage, with a few pieces from Mugan\u2019s own wardrobe.</p> <p>The clue to the magic of Normal People is in the name; not the normal part, the people part. Sally Rooney\u2019s fine-grained characterisation of Marianne is all there on the small screen. It\u2019s in her summer-holiday plimsolls and her washed-out underwear, the protective jumpers she wears to the library and her flimsy, over-exposing party dresses.</p> <p>If Rooney is the first great millennial novelist, Marianne is the first great millennial TV style icon. The show captures the way young women look now. The one-piece swimming costume instead of the bikini, the bedroom loungewear that spans essay-writing and sleeping. The high-waisted jeans, and the short party dresses. Even Marianne\u2019s slenderness \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/are-sally-rooney-s-heroines-too-skinny-1.4021294\">often mentioned in the book</a> \u2013 is accentuated in the modern way, in the looseness of a pair of jeans or the leotard fit of a vest, rather than the old-fashioned methods of darted tailoring, or waist-cinching belts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a53a558cd6b1e3c31879eec5c8ebdbe13d308b66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a53a558cd6b1e3c31879eec5c8ebdbe13d308b66/0_0_884_723/500.jpg\" alt=\"Marianne Normal People\" width=\"500\" height=\"409\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marianne in a short A-line tunic in sun-faded gingham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Normal People</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mugan wanted to show how teenage style evolves in the years from adolescence to college. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to just shake off everything that was part of their youth,\u201d she told Grazia about how the clothes changed in Marianne and Connell\u2019s move from Sligo to Dublin. \u201cYou take little bits of them with them. You explore how they find themselves as they evolve. Subtlety was the key.\u201d During Marianne\u2019s first year at Trinity, and on that idyllic Italian holiday, she is trying on a new sophistication for size. On a visit home to Sligo the high-school princess contemporaries who still wear their hair in shiny prom-night ringlets look calcified next to the modishly tousled Marianne, like once-prized dolls now gathering dust. Trapped at home with her awful family, her wardrobe regresses from Trinity urbanity into cut-off denim skirts and plimsolls.<br><br>Edgar-Jones told iD magazine that working with Mugan on Marianne\u2019s wardrobe was one of her favourite parts of making Normal People. \u201cIt was so fun,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen the outfit feels right you can adopt the physicality much more easily, because your clothes kind of dictate the way you navigate the world \u2026 as [Marianne] ages, she stops needing to be so out there and feels comfortable to wear clothes that fit and feel good.\u201d Perhaps you have more self-control than me and haven\u2019t gulped down the last episodes yet, so I will stop there. But Normal People has the makings of a fashion classic.</p>",
  "<p>Heathrow will start using thermal cameras to carry out temperature checks on passengers within the next fortnight, as it called for common health screening standards around the world for air travellers.</p> <p>The UK\u2019s busiest airport <a href=\"https://mediacentre.heathrow.com/pressrelease/details/81/Brand-News-22/12286\">said</a> it would trial thermal cameras capable of monitoring the temperature of people in the immigration halls, initially in Terminal 2. </p> <p>If successful, it will install the equipment in the departures, connections and staff search areas.

The UK has the world\u2019s third-largest aviation sector, offering the platform for the government to take a lead in agreeing a common international standard for aviation health with our main trading partners.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"903cc508bda4270c92fa3800f19a63e80b60be05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/903cc508bda4270c92fa3800f19a63e80b60be05/0_15_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Holland-Kaye, Heathrow's CEO\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heathrow\u2019s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, says aviation is key to restarting the UK economy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PRU/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis standard is key to minimising transmission of Covid-19 across borders, and the technology we are trialling at Heathrow could be part of the solution.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cIf we are told that the only solution until we can get a vaccine in 12-18 months\u2019 time is to socially distance in an airport, then tens of thousands of jobs will be cut. We cannot afford to wait that long to get flying again.\u201d</p> <p>Heathrow already carries out temperature checks at departure gates on passengers who are going to countries that require them. It said travellers would experience minimal impact to their journeys and noted that many airlines had been taking passengers\u2019 temperature during the outbreak.</p> <p>Before the Covid-19 crisis, 8o million passengers passed through Heathrow each year. The airport will release numbers for April on Monday that will show a 90% decline from 2019.</p> <p>Patrick Ikhena, the head of travel at comparethemarket.com, said: \u201cIt is likely that, once restrictions are eased, international travel will look quite different for passengers \u2013 at least for the foreseeable future. </p> <p>\u201cThere are likely to be more checks at airports and other major transportation hubs, which could include temperature checks and the requirement to provide evidence that you do not have Covid-19 before embarking on a flight.\u201d</p> <p>He said passengers would need to allow considerably more time to arrive at the airport than before the crisis, and this could lead to a surge in the number of Brits holidaying in the UK.</p> <p>Customer research by comparethemarket has found that only 6% of Britons are considering a long-haul holiday this winter and just 9% are looking at booking a European beach holiday for this summer or autumn, \u201cmost likely due to a combination of strained household budgets and a wariness over travelling overseas\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>Police and health and safety inspectors are investigating the death of a successful businessman whose side project raising water buffalo ended in tragedy when one of the animals killed him and injured two of his children.</p> <p>Ralph \u201cJon\u201d Jump is believed to have been injured as he and his two children, who worked with him on their farm in south-east Wales, tried to get one of the animals back into a pen after it escaped.</p> <p>Jump, 57, was pronounced dead at the scene of the incident near the town of Usk, Monmouthshire, while his 19-year-old son, Peter, was taken to hospital with critical injuries and his daughter, Isabel, 22, sustained a serious leg wound. The buffalo has been destroyed.</p> <p>Neighbours said Jump ran the farm as a sideline to his main business, and produced craft soap from the buffalo milk.</p> <p>One neighbour said: \u201cJon approached us last year about buying some hay for his buffalo. We asked him what he was doing and he said he was trying to diversify the farm. I think he had about a dozen buffalo at the farm and had bred a couple of calves over the past year or so.\u201d</p> <p>Another neighbour said they were a \u201ccharming\u201d family. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible tragedy. They couldn\u2019t be nicer people.\u201d</p> <p>Jump was managing director of a company supplying heating equipment. The buffalo milk soap was sold through a business called The Bufalina Soap Company.</p> <p> The company\u2019s website says: \u201cWe make our soap with the milk from our herd of Mediterranean water buffalo. Around the world this buffalo breed is famous for its dairy products such as mozzarella, gelato and ice cream. The richness of the milk makes it ideal for making a creamy, luxurious and gentle soap which leaves the skin feeling soft and moisturised.\u201d</p> <p>Last year Jump advertised the sale of \u201cgreat-natured heifer calves, used to regular handling\u201d on his Facebook page.</p> <p>Water buffalo are bred in the UK for their meat and milk and sometimes as part of conservation projects because of the way they graze wetland.</p> <p>Other water buffalo farmers spoke of their shock. Steven Mitchell, who raises water buffalo at <a href=\"https://www.thebuffalofarm.co.uk/about-us\">Clentrie farm Auchtertool, south-east Scotland,</a> said: \u201cThey are very intelligent, friendly animals. They don\u2019t kick like cows but their horns can be severe and they can be protective if they have calves.\u201d</p> <p>Oakley Whilock, who has 20 water buffalo at his farm in Staffordshire, said they were generally placid. \u201cWe can even ride our bull,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we have had the odd close call when they are calving.\u201d</p> <p>Deaths involving cows are more common than might be expected. In 2018-19 there were nine deaths involving cattle in Britain. But none of the farmers had heard of a case in which anyone had been killed in the UK by a water buffalo.</p> <p>Water buffalo have been grazed on the Teifi Marshes in Pembrokeshire, south-west Wales.</p> <p>Sarah Kessel, the chief executive officer of the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales, said they had been very beneficial because their love of wallowing has led to the creation of pools that create the perfect habitat for amphibians, dragonflies, damselflies and wetland birds. She added: \u201cWe have always found our herd to be very docile, and easy to handle.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>The Home Office has been accused of interfering with the independence of the judiciary after it emerged that judges were asked to provide written explanations for a rise in the number of detainees released from immigration centres during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>In a letter to the president of the Tribunal, Immigration and Asylum Chamber dated 29 April 2020, the Home Office\u2019s head of appeals, James Stevens, wrote: \u201cThe numbers of those in detention have reduced very significantly since the start of this emergency.\u201d He went on to say: \u201cThe Home Office is somewhat surprised at the level of grants of bail in recent weeks.\u201d</p> <p>Official figures record 1,225 people in detention centres on 1 January and 368 at the latest count \u2013 a reduction of almost three-quarters.</p> <p>Stevens outlined the ways in which the Home Office had responded to the risks coronavirus posed to detainees, before adding: \u201cWhere bail is granted I would ask you to consider whether immigration judges could provide written reasons for this.\u201d Judges are not required by law to do this.</p> <p>Stevens wrote: \u201cWhile I realise this is not a requirement under the procedure rules, it would assist the Home Office to fully understand the reasons why bail has been granted.\u201d</p> <p>The Home Office is supposed to detain only those it can deport imminently, and its ability to do this has been drastically reduced due to flights being grounded. </p> <p>There have been three confirmed cases of Covid-19 among immigration detainees, and the risk of catching the virus remains high among those who are locked up for extended periods.\ufeff</p> <p>In a response dated 1 May, Michael Clements, the chamber\u2019s president, issued a robust rejection of the Home Office\u2019s request. \u201cAs independent judiciary we decide bail applications in accordance with the law, which includes the guidance which has been issued. There has been no change in either the law or the guidance,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>\u201cThe primary function of detention is accordingly to facilitate removal, and unless there are very powerful reasons to the contrary bail should be granted if there is no removal of the bail applicant within the reasonably foreseeable future.\u201d</p> <p>He said that during the pandemic he had instituted a \u201cminded to grant\u201d bail process, giving the Home Office an early indication before a bail hearing took place that a judge was likely to grant bail unless the Home Office could provide specific reasons why this should not happen.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately, the feedback that I am receiving is not only that the Home Office rarely consent to the grant of bail having seen the \u2018minded to grant\u2019 but that bail is still opposed at the hearing without any meaningful additional representations being given.\u201d</p> <p>Pierre Makhlouf, an assistant director at Bail for Immigration Detainees, accused the Home Office of interfering with the judicial approach to bail applications because the rate of successful bail applications had shot up from its usual level of about 30%. He said 55 out of 58 cases where the charity provided representation since lockdown began had been granted bail.</p> <p>Adrian Berry, the chair of the Immigration Law Practitioners\u2019 Association, said: \u201cIt is not appropriate for government to use its position outside of the courtroom to seek to influence decisions. The separation of powers between the government and judiciary is a core constitutional principle.\u201d</p> <p>Bella Sankey, the director of Detention Action, which launched a legal challenge calling for the mass release of detainees during the pandemic, said: \u201cThis letter is a constitutional disgrace, entirely in keeping with a government that thinks it is above the law and not answerable to our sovereign parliament.</p> <p>\u201cThat the Home Office has sought to pressure the immigration tribunal over its bail decisions during a global pandemic shows alarming disrespect for the right to liberty, the rule of law and the separation of powers.\u201d</p> <p>Toufique Hossain, of Duncan Lewis solicitors, who brought the Detention Action case, said: \u201cSeparation of powers is a basic principle of any democratic society to safeguard liberties and guard against tyranny.\u201d</p> <p>\ufeffA Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThis is completely untrue, and the Guardian knows full well that this letter is explaining transparently to the judiciary how we are responding to this pandemic, including carefully reviewing the cases of those in detention. The public expects law and order to be maintained, which is why 95% of those currently in detention are foreign-national offenders.\u201d\ufeff</p>",
  "<p>An anti-abortion campaigner who is banned from displaying a poster featuring an image of a dead foetus alongside a picture of the Labour MP Stella Creasy has failed to overturn a council order against him.</p> <p>Christian Hacking challenged the imposition of a community protection notice (CPN) after he put up the image of what he said was a \u201c24-week-old aborted baby girl\u201d in Creasy\u2019s constituency in Walthamstow, north-east London.</p> <p>Creasy, 43, was pregnant at the time. She has been a vocal supporter of women\u2019s right to choose and led a successful campaign last year to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/09/mps-vote-to-extend-same-sex-marriage-to-northern-ireland\">extend abortion to Northern Ireland</a>.</p> <p>Hacking, 29, from nearby Hackney, said the display of the bloody image was part of a \u201cStopStella\u201d event last October. At a two-day hearing in February, he argued that the community protection notice ban imposed by Waltham Forest borough council was illegal.</p> <p>He urged the court to reconsider the matter on human rights grounds, comparing the emotional impact of the display to that of images of three-year-old Alan Kurdi, whose lifeless body was pictured in news stories around the world highlighting the Syrian refugee crisis in 2015.</p> <p>Hacking told the hearing \u201cThe whole business of what we do is exposing the reality of abortion to members of the public who don\u2019t know what abortion looks like. Generally speaking, we know that the public are misinformed by what abortion procedures entail.\u201d</p> <p>Hacking, from the campaign group Centre for Bio-ethical Reform UK, said the 10ft x 10ft (3-metre x 3-metre) poster was designed to educate the public about abortion.</p> <p>At Thames magistrates court on Wednesday, the district judge Jonathan Radway dismissed the appeal during a two-minute hearing.</p> <p>In his written decision, he said: \u201cI find a prolonged static display, intended to last a couple of hours in the busy middle of the day, unavoidable to those entering the town square, of a deeply disturbing image which caused harm to some observers, is beyond the margin of what freedom of expression requires, even for political speech.</p> <p>\u201cWas the CPN a proportionate response to the situation? After anxious consideration, I have concluded it was.\u201d</p> <p>Radway said his ruling was \u201cnot about the rights and wrongs of abortion\u201d.</p> <p>Creasy has previously told MPs how she felt \u201charassed\u201d by the campaign and sought police assistance.</p> <p>During the February hearing, one local resident told the court she felt \u201ctruly sick in her stomach\u201d on seeing the image, and had \u201cbeen left feeling anxious and nervous when approaching the location in town\u201d.</p> <p>Neither Hacking nor Creasy was present in court for the hearing on Wednesday.</p> <p>Hacking and his supporters said they would appeal against the judgment.</p> <p>Andrea Williams, the chief executive of the Christian Legal Centre, which is supporting the case, said: \u201cThe ruling hinges on the idea that this image, showing the tragic reality of abortion, causes significant and lasting emotional harm.</p> <p>\u201cBut however uncomfortable the truth, we must be free to make these distressing realities known, or the vastly more horrific truth of abortion becomes immune to criticism.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a high bar to restricting free speech. Freedom of speech must include, and has been ruled in law to include, that which is shocking, provocative and offensive. Political campaigns are often shocking and disturbing.\u201d</p> <p>Hacking said: \u201cI am deeply disappointed that our appeal to show the reality of abortion to the people of Waltham Forest has not been successful. The real victim of abortion is not MP Stella Creasy, or those negatively impacted by its visualisation, but the unborn child.</p> <p><em>\u201c</em>How can we see positive change in the UK if politicians and councils are allowed to dictate how we express peaceable opinions in public? For the sake of the unborn and for freedom of speech, we must take this appeal further and hold those authorities to account.\u201d</p> <p>Clare Coghill, the leader of Waltham Forest council, said: \u201cWe are glad that the court has agreed that our actions to protect residents of Waltham Forest against gratuitously offensive imagery being displayed in Walthamstow town centre were proportionate. We acted after receiving numerous complaints from members of the public about these images.</p> <p>\u201cWe fundamentally believe in free speech and the right to protest. However, we also believe that those who live, work, and study in the borough have the right to use their town centre without being aggressively confronted with deliberately provocative material.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>In the topsy-turvy world of lockdown, the message from the UK\u2019s holiday hotspots this bank holiday weekend is the same as it was at Easter four weeks ago: stay away.</p> <p>However, behind the scenes tourism officials and hospitality bosses are busy working out how destinations will start to welcome back visitors this summer. Without knowing exactly what changes will be announced when Boris Johnson produces his roadmap on Sunday, tourist boards across the UK are setting out plans for a phased reopening of attractions and businesses as they endeavour to salvage some of the 2020 season. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to wait until lockdown\u2019s over and find we\u2019ve not got the plans in place,\u201d said Gill Haigh, chief executive of Cumbria Tourism. \u201cThe question is how we reset.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a big question. Discussions around what to open and when are taking place against a backdrop of huge public anxiety about coming out of lockdown. An <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/02/fearful-britons-oppose-lifting-lockdown-schools-pubs-restaurants-opinium-poll\">Observer poll</a> at the weekend found that the majority of people believe it\u2019s too soon to ease restrictions, and local people are understandably furious<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/lake-district-coronavirus-lockdown-north-east-second-wave-risk\"> </a>with those do flout the current rules, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/lake-district-coronavirus-lockdown-north-east-second-wave-risk\">as happened this week in the Lake District</a>.</p> <p>The challenge for destinations is giving tourism the shot in the arm that it desperately needs while reassuring visitors, employees and residents that they will be safe. As a result of that delicate balancing act, holidaying in the UK this summer may well feel like we\u2019ve time-travelled back to the 1950s, before the advent of affordable foreign travel: there will be day trips to beaches, parks and gardens; we\u2019ll be able to buy an ice-cream but won\u2019t be dining in a crowded restaurant; if it rains we won\u2019t be sheltering in the nearest museum or indoor activity centre.</p> <p>Outdoor spaces in rural and coastal areas and attractions with large grounds will be the first to welcome visitors, not just because those are places where social distancing can be maintained but because, post-lockdown, people will be drawn to nature for its calming effects. \u201cConsumer research shows that people want to get back to simple pleasures,\u201d said Kate Mavor, chief executive of English Heritage, which manages 400 historic sites in England. \u201cPeople can come with a picnic and just enjoy being close to nature. There\u2019s also great comfort in being in places that have stood the sense of time \u2013 that have survived war and pestilence. We will be a tonic for people when they come.\u201d</p> <p>But even simple pleasures will be different post-lockdown. Pre-booking visits to heritage sites will become the new norm. One-way systems, extra signage, hand sanitiser stations and staff in PPE will be familiar sights as attractions strive to minimise risk to visitors and staff.</p> <p>\u201cThe challenge even with open spaces will be around security and making sure people are being sensible,\u201d said Deirdre Wells, chief executive of Visit Kent and Hertfordshire. \u201cWhat people were used to beforehand will not happen now: just turning up at a National Trust place may not be possible.\u201d</p> <p>This first phase of openings will be closely watched by tourist boards aware that recovery is dependent on the confidence of local communities. \u201cIf local people see that these attractions are acting responsibly, you\u2019re warming them up to the idea of more visitors coming back by late summer and autumn,\u201d said Jo Dilley of Marketing Peak District.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97b70518f33382e6eac36cad75970d811672c97d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97b70518f33382e6eac36cad75970d811672c97d/0_8_4272_2564/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A cosy wooden cottage by a stream in Snowdonia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Self-catering cottages like this one in Snowdonia, may be able to open before hotels.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: pr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Riddell Graham of Visit Scotland added: \u201cWe had a not particularly helpful situation early on when people were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/21/scottish-government-furious-at-travellers-to-highlands-and-islands\">trying to get to islands to self-isolate</a>. So no matter what we do, we have to take on board the community interest, particularly for more remote rural areas.\u201d</p> <p>At the same time as reassuring communities that their safety is a priority, tourism officials will be pushing the value of visitors to the local economy. The impact of coronavirus on the 241,000 tourism businesses in the UK has been catastrophic. \u201cYou can\u2019t underestimate how important the visitor economy is for an area like ours,\u201d said Haigh of Cumbria Tourism. \u201cIf tourism isn\u2019t allowed to return \u2013 and if the value of that tourism isn\u2019t created, a lot of businesses won\u2019t be here this time next year.\u201d</p> <p>Of course the economic impact hasn\u2019t just been on businesses. Financial pressures on individuals will affect the recovery. Greg Stevenson, founder of cottage company <a href=\"https://www.underthethatch.co.uk/\">Under the Thatch</a>, said the company is receiving daily bookings for July and August \u2013 but mainly for more expensive properties. \u201cIt\u2019s wealthier people who are booking five-star cottages.\u201d</p> <p>Stevenson, who lives in Ireland, believes Johnson\u2019s roadmap announcement will boost public confidence. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it in Ireland, where there\u2019s a massive difference in public feeling [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/02/ireland-extends-covid-19-lockdown-to-18-may-before-phased-exit\">since a five-stage exit from lockdown was announced on 2 May</a>]. I think people in the UK will be much less panicky about the situation after Sunday.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People come for the social aspect \u2013 to hear the buzz of people in the bar.

New procedures will be put in place, such as sterilising hard surfaces and providing antiseptic sprays, but he is sure there\u2019s an appetite for holidays this summer. \u201cI\u2019ve got no doubt at all that there is demand for people to get away tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>The owner of campground <a href=\"https://thequietsite.co.uk/\">The Quiet Site</a> in Ullswater agrees that an appetite for travel will return relatively swiftly. \u201cIn Denmark, which was the first European country to ease lockdown, demand is at 90% compared with last year. There won\u2019t be a rush to travel but it will come back,\u201d said Daniel Holder. He is anticipating welcoming campers and caravanners back to his site this summer although the onsite bar, shop and check-in will come later. But part-opening will take its toll. \u201cIt will be hard to reach a break-even point this season.\u201d</p> <p> Hotels, restaurants and bars also fear that opening halfway through the season with reduced capacity due to social distancing will be fatal to certain businesses unless the government extends its financial support. In an open letter to Johnson this week, Robin Hutson, chief executive of Homegrown Hotels, which operates six <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/aug/20/the-pig-at-combe-honiton-devon-hotel-review\">Pig hotels</a> and the Lime Wood Hotel in the New Forest, wrote: \u201cThe worst possible scenario for rural hospitality would be the \u2018perfect storm\u2019 of furlough ceasing, hospitality opening up, but social distancing rules imposed \u2026 This toxic recipe would immediately translate to mass redundancies and the permanent loss of hundreds of thousands of rural jobs. This would be economically and socially devastating for rural Britain.\u201d</p> <p>The letter, supported by many of the biggest names in the food and hotel trades, including Rick Stein, Mitch Tonks, Michael Caines and Gordon Campbell-Gray, called for a flexible, part-time furlough scheme until the end of the first quarter of 2021 and an extension of the business rates holiday until the second quarter. He is optimistic that hospitality will be considered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/rishi-sunak-preparing-to-wind-down-furlough-scheme-from-july\">when the Treasury announces details of the scaled-back scheme.</a></p> <p>Like hoteliers across the country, Hutson and his team are drawing up plans for post-lockdown operating.

  "<p>An eight-year-old British boy is taking the Home Office to the high court over its policy of denying families like his access to the welfare safety net.</p> <p>The boy, who cannot be named, is arguing that the Home Office\u2019s no recourse to public funds (NRPF) policy is unlawful and that during the Covid-19 pandemic the policy increases the risk of families becoming destitute as well as heightening public health risks as people are forced into overcrowded accommodation or onto the streets.</p> <p>The NRPF policy was introduced in 2012 as part of the government\u2019s so-called \u201chostile environment\u201d. It affects different groups of migrants, some of whom have leave to remain and some who do not.

  "<p>The newspaper frenzy over Prof Neil Ferguson\u2019s love life is just the latest example of a scientist who has been targeted for confronting parts of Britain\u2019s political-media complex with evidence that it finds too difficult to accept.</p> <p>There is no doubt that Ferguson, who sat on the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) before his resignation, was wrong to ignore the government\u2019s social distancing rules. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-adviser-prof-neil-ferguson-resigns-after-breaking-lockdown-rules\">has admitted</a> as much, even if he did believe that he was at low risk of spreading the Sars-Cov-2 virus because he had already recovered from Covid-19.</p> <p>But today\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hendopolis/status/1257789476358799360/photo/1\">lurid front-page headlines</a> follow a campaign to discredit him by those ideologically opposed to government interventions, and who have used such tactics against scientists in other fields, particularly climate change.</p> <p>It is a further sign that some media commentators and politicians favour a version of Britain in which politicians and newspaper editors dictate the public\u2019s understanding of biology and physics.</p> <p>Ferguson has been under attack ever since his research team\u2019s modelling <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf\">suggested in mid-March</a> that hundreds of thousands of deaths in the UK from Covid-19 were possible if stronger efforts were not made to curb the growing epidemic.</p> <p>Within a week, the prime minister announced the current lockdown measures. The move was perceived as a U-turn because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-science-chief-defends-uk-measures-criticism-herd-immunity\">the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser</a> had days earlier suggested that allowing widespread infection might be an option to achieve \u201cherd immunity\u201d across the country.</p> <p>Ferguson\u2019s contribution was initially praised, but it was not long before his reputation was under assault from parts of the media traditionally sceptical of a so-called \u201cnanny state\u201d.</p> <p>On 28 March, the Daily Telegraph <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/28/neil-ferguson-scientist-convinced-boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-lockdown-criticised/\">published an article</a> alleging that \u201cthe scientist whose calculations about the potentially devastating impact of the coronavirus directly led to the countrywide lockdown has been criticised in the past for flawed research\u201d.</p> <p>The story relied on the views of a handful of critics of how Ferguson\u2019s models were used by the then Labour government to tackle the 2001 outbreak of foot and mouth disease. The article failed to mention that Ferguson received an OBE in recognition for his important role in the crisis, or that he was afterwards elected a fellow of the prestigious Academy of Medical Sciences.</p> <p>The next day, <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-8163587/PETER-HITCHENS-Great-Panic-foolish-freedom-broken-economy-crippled.html\">Peter Hitchens, in the Mail on Sunday</a>, described the lockdown as \u201cmass house arrest\u201d and identified Ferguson as being \u201cone of those largely responsible for the original panic\u201d.</p> <p>A few days later the Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-lessons-from-the-asteroid-that-didnt-hit-earth-11585780465\">published an article</a> by two British commentators that argued \u201cthe coronavirus pandemic has dramatically demonstrated the limits of scientific modelling to predict the future\u201d. It singled out Ferguson\u2019s work and complained that \u201creasonable people might wonder whether something made with 13-year-old, undocumented computer code should be used to justify shutting down the economy\u201d.</p> <p>Bizarrely, this article was written by Benny Peiser and Andrew Montford, the director and deputy director of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/02/nigel-lawson-climate-sceptic-organisation-funders\">set up by Nigel Lawson</a> in 2009 to lobby against climate change policies. The foundation has a track record of attempting to discredit climate models that show rising greenhouse gas levels risk warming the world to dangerous levels.</p> <p>The promoters of climate change denial, which include some newspapers, are well used to attacking scientists whose work they do not like. Lawson\u2019s foundation was launched just a few days after the publication in late November 2009 of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/nov/20/climate-sceptics-hackers-leaked-emails\">emails that had been hacked</a> from the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia. He and other so-called \u201csceptics\u201d falsely suggested that the emails revealed misconduct by climate scientists.</p> <p>Within a few hours of his work being misrepresented around the world, the head of the unit, Prof Phil Jones, started to receive threats against his life and the lives of his family. <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8502823.stm\">He later admitted</a> that he had even contemplated suicide before numerous inquiries cleared him of any scientific wrongdoing.</p> <p>It is fortunate that Jones did not succumb after such a concerted assault on his reputation. A similar ordeal apparently caused Dr David Kelly to take his own life after the biological weapons expert was hounded for revealing that the threat posed by Iraq\u2019s weapons of mass destruction had been exaggerated by Tony Blair\u2019s government.</p> <p>Many other scientists in the UK working on issues that have implications for government policy know what it is like to be vilified, both publicly and privately, for their findings. They are regularly attacked by many of the British media commentators who are currently joining the pile-on to Ferguson.</p> <p>It is time to put a stop to these media lynch mobs that risk driving Britain back into the Dark Ages. We must continue to base our decisions on the advice of experts such as Ferguson, and reject the irrational arguments of those who want political dogma to trump evidence.</p> <p>\u2022 Bob Ward is policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics</p>",
  "<p>Contestants getting booted off of reality shows for misconduct is as core to the genre as the flinging of a drink in someone\u2019s face during an argument. The disqualification of \u201cNasty\u201d Nick Bateman from the first series of Big Brother for attempting to manipulate the house vote shook the nation \u2013 a move that 20 years later, would likely see him celebrated as an icon on the American iteration.</p> <p>In 2012, Willam seemed in line to be crowned America\u2019s next drag superstar, but left with the much more bad-ass title of the first ever Drag Race contestant to be disqualified. He was asked to leave after receiving a prohibited conjugal visit from his husband. But programmes often struggle with how to deal with cast behaviour that is too sinister to nearly package into a \u201cvillain edit\u201d.</p> <p>That\u2019s the issue faced by 90 Day Fianc\u00e9, an American reality TV series on TLC that follows US citizens and their foreign spouses to be, as they navigate love and language barriers in the wake of their K-1 visa application. This year, the equally popular spinoff Before the 90 Days (following couples pre-proposal), saw lovelorn American Geoffrey Paschel fly to Russia to meet his girlfriend Varya Manila in person for the first time.</p> <p>Their story centred on his hopes to come clean with her about drug charges that led to over two years behind bars. What he and the producers refused to address in the scenes were the various, more serious criminal charges he <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/90-day-fiance-varya-geoffrey-pachel-drug-charges-criminal-explained/\">appeared in court for this January</a>: aggravated kidnapping, domestic assault, interference with emergency calls, and vandalism. Last year, he was arrested after his live-in girlfriend said that he attacked her. Paschel has four ex wives, one of whom asked to file a protection order against him and another who claimed he had <a href=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/90-day-fiance-fans-start-petition-to-remove-geoffrey-paschel-from-show.html/\">raped her multiple times</a>.</p> <p>Paschel denies all the allegations, but they are harrowing nonetheless, and at odds with the show\u2019s lighthearted, rom-com-esque premise. But rather than kick him off (or not feature someone with such a chequered past), TLC have opted to simply ignore them, and the<a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/tlc-remove-geoffrey-paschel-from-tlc-shows-as-well-as-let-advertisers-know-what-they-are-supporting?recruiter=1045987469&amp;recruited_by_id=30814da0-5af1-11ea-a80f-c581b41dc68a&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=petition_dashboard\"> petition</a> for his removal. It\u2019s led to deeply uncomfortable viewing \u2013 when the couple fallout, it\u2019s hard not to worry for Manila\u2019s safety. As TLC continues to air episodes without even acknowledging the claims, Paschel continues to grow his platform on a widely watched show that casts him as a hopeless romantic on a weekly basis.</p> <p>It\u2019s not the first time that these programmes have failed to act appropriately in the face of controversy. On the 39th season of the American series Survivor, a castaway named Dan Spilo faced allegations of <a href=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/survivor-the-real-reason-dan-spilo-was-removed-from-the-game.html/\">inappropriate touching of contestants</a>. Producers allowed this to play out as a storyline on the show, keeping him on the island even after complaints had been made about his behaviour on camera. In fact, the first cast member to accuse him was initially voted off by fellow contestants \u2013 Spilo was only removed because of behaviour toward a member of the crew. The result was a disturbing, exploitative episode that should never have been aired.</p> <p>Reality TV must find better ways of dealing with not only the frivolous, but also hard realities. This season of Ru Paul\u2019s Drag Race at least attempted a flawed, but superior alternative. Contestant Sherry Pie, (real name Joey Gugiemelli), was revealed to have coerced at <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/3/7/21168226/rupaul-drag-race-disqualifies-sherry-pie-catfishing-sexual-harassment\">least eight different men into sending him videos of them masturbating</a>, by masquerading as a casting agent \u2013 for which he has apologised saying he is seeking counselling. Fans called for the series to reshoot, but VH1 chose to proceed and made the unprecedented move of disqualifying Shery Pie before the show had even aired.</p> <p>As all but the series finale had been filmed, (and Sherry Pie reportedly made it all the way to<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/sherry-pie-disqualified-rupaul-s-drag-race-finale-over-catfishing-n1151826\"> the final four of the competition</a>), it was a disqualification that looked a little different. Drag Race fans know that its value lies not just in the cash prize of $100,000, but priceless exposure. Many of the show\u2019s biggest success stories did not win the crown, but the hearts of millions \u2013 an ultimately more valuable prize.</p> <p>The allegations surfaced before VH1 had a chance to reshoot the first episode, which led to a sickly launch that was too heavy on the Sherry \u2013 he received ample screen time and praise from the judges for his performances. But by episode two, it was apparent that he would have no character arc at all. All Gugiemelli\u2019s confessional interviews were cut, as were any scenes that weren\u2019t mandatory in making the episode make narrative sense. Whenever he wins a challenge, a post episode statement clarifies money won would be donated to The Trevor Project, a 24-hour confidential suicide hotline for LGBTQ youth.</p> <p>Though the move sometimes leads to clunky, confused storytelling, it\u2019s been effective in rendering Sherry Pie irrelevant. Gugiemelli has the smallest online following of any of the Queens \u2013 the show\u2019s first eliminated contestant Dahlia Sin has garnered a following neatly three times as large. One can only imagine how his profile would have swelled had Drag Race approached things in the same way 90 Day Fianc\u00e9 has.</p> <p>More than most types of TV, reality shows can both create and elevate monsters. We cannot continue to understate its power as a platform, as well as the responsibility that comes with it.</p>",

But then <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/sport/rugby/article/3053059/tokyo-2020-emergency-medical-technician-turned-us-womens-rugby-captain\">she found rugby</a> and at an athletic 5ft 11in and 165lbs made the national set-up quickly.

The Black Ferns surged back before Covid-19 shuttered the series but the Eagles are real contenders.</p> <p>For Gustaitis, \u201cthe pieces were starting to slot in, the puzzle was almost complete. And then, to have that taken away \u2026 it was shattering.</p> <p>\u201cIt took me a few days to wrap my head around it. I went from being sad, to angry, to just numb, and not really knowing how to feel, to talking to a lot of my team-mates, the coaches. It was nice to know we\u2019re all on the same page, and then just to spread it to everyone worldwide. It\u2019s an even playing field.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking at it as a second chance.

  "<p>Yvonne Terlingen, who has died of ovarian cancer aged 75, was of the pioneering generation that shaped Amnesty International. She worked for AI probably longer than anyone else.</p> <p>The daughter of Annie (nee Donker), a schoolteacher, and Bout Terlingen, a building contractor, she was born in Amsterdam and grew up there, along with her older brother, Rob, and an older half-brother, Tom. Yvonne went to the city\u2019s Gymnasium Fons Vitae, then graduated in law from the University of Amsterdam.</p> <p>Yvonne started work in London in 1972 as AI\u2019s south Asia researcher. Decades later she is still remembered in the region. \u201cOf course I knew Yvonne Terlingen,\u201d said one elderly Sri Lankan. \u201cShe visited us in prison in 1975.\u201d </p> <p>Much later, on sabbatical, Yvonne worked at the United Nations international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague in 1995-96, and in Belgrade in 1996-97; she then returned to AI as adviser on international organisations. She served nine years from 2001 until her retirement in 2010 as Amnesty\u2019s UN representative in New York.</p> <p>At AI, ideals turned into practical action and work with colleagues resulted in lifelong friendships. Yvonne brought to her work a fierce sense of justice, singleminded dedication, profound knowledge of human rights, sharp intellect, boundless energy and a disarmingly direct approach. Colleagues testify to her strength, spirit and independence. Always ready to share her wisdom, she was also candid in acknowledging and sharing mistakes.</p> <p>In retirement Yvonne volunteered at the Heathrow immigration removal centres. She returned to New York to play a central role in the \u2013 strikingly successful \u2013 civil society campaign 1 for 7 Billion to open up the process for selection of the UN secretary general in 2016 and beyond.</p> <p>An essential part of Yvonne was her keen aesthetic sense, her deep love of art and music, and her own significant talents in both. She played the harpsichord, her instruments made for her by her dear friend and former partner, Chris Nobbs, with whom she had a daughter, Hannah.</p> <p>I first met Yvonne 45 years ago, through her work in AI, and we became close friends. She was a caring friend to so many: warm, extraordinarily thoughtful, kind and tremendous fun.</p> <p>Hannah was never far from her mind and Yvonne\u2019s last months were wonderfully sustained by their loving relationship. \u201cI am so lucky\u201d was her constant refrain to family and friends.

  "<p>Before the internet ruined the World Cup there was wonder in ignorance. You could look forward to discovering great players and teams about whom you knew next to nothing. In 1986 my brother and I hoped the tournament would be all about some Hungarian called Zoltan Peter. Our reason was bad.</p> <p>All we knew about Peter was his name and his face because he seemed to be in every pack of Panini stickers we bought. Every time we removed that shiny wrapper there he was, seemingly mocking us with his Lego-man hairdo and the haunting expression of someone who knew there is no problem so grim it cannot be made worse.</p> <p>When the tournament kicked off we had nearly 100 Peterstickers. He was unswappable. My brother started sticking them all over the place. Our home came to resemble the capital city of a totalitarian state, with pictures of the feared ruler wherever you turned.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"95eb2f0b1040fa0013997ddc0777162b30c2fac9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95eb2f0b1040fa0013997ddc0777162b30c2fac9/50_14_685_962/356.jpg\" alt=\"Zoltan Peter\u2019s face was everywhere we looked early on in the 1986 World Cup tournament.\" width=\"356\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zoltan Peter\u2019s face was everywhere we looked early on in the 1986 World Cup tournament.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Panini</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The hope was Peter would reveal himself to be a genius in Mexico, the breakout star of the tournament, a player whose stickers would suddenly be in hot demand, making us akin to lucky imbeciles who accidentally bought shares in an oil company just before it struck black gold.</p> <p>Some pundits made Hungary dark horses for success. They had qualified instead of the Netherlands and they would be highly motivated for their first match \u2013 against the USSR 30 years after the bloody suppression of the 1956 Hungarian revolution.</p> <p>We thought we knew a little about the Soviets, since the first Republic of Ireland match we attended was against them in the first qualifier for the finals. A glorious goal by Mickey Walsh yielded a win that took Ireland nowhere. USSR advanced by winning all their home games but none of their away ones. They were so blunt in the run-up to Mexico \u2013 scoring once in five friendlies \u2013 that they replaced their manager just before the tournament, rehiring Valeriy Lobanovskyi, whom they had previously jilted. Hungary\u2019s for the taking?</p> <p>Peter turned out to be a tall 21-year-old, a left-back on the raw side. When Nikolay Larionov ran down the right for the Soviets in the second minute, Peter hurtled towards him with all the control of a man using roller skates for the first time. Crash. Viktor Chanov dabbed the resultant free-kick towards the near post, Hungary defended pitifully and Pavel Yakovenko slotted the ball into the net. Oh, for Pete\u2019s sake.</p> <p>Then Sergei Aleinikov blasted in a stupendous drive from miles out. Two-nil to the USSR after five minutes. My brother and I now yearned, petty as you like, for total Hungarian humiliation.</p> <p>In sport it can feel wholesome to want your rival to be crushed. Easing off is a betrayal. Back in the Cold War days commentators called teams from behind the Iron Curtain \u201ccrack outfits\u201d and \u201cruthless machines\u201d, their forwards not baby-faced assassins but cold-blooded, robotic ones. It was dehumanising hooey but, on this occasion, we demanded the Soviets be heartless.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7e35a13e649bd1d53e8329bdb62c81545bea6c4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e35a13e649bd1d53e8329bdb62c81545bea6c4b/0_0_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hungary\u2019s goalkeeper Peter Disztl (left) can only look on as Sergei Rodionov from the USSR team runs through the Hungarian defence before slotting the ball home for the Soviets\u2019 sixth and final goal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The goalkeeper Peter Disztl (left) can only look on as Sergei Rodionov runs through Hungary\u2019s defence before slotting the ball home for the USSR\u2019s sixth and final goal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But wait! In the 21<sup>st</sup> minute Hungary won a free-kick within shooting range and Peter stepped up to take it. He ran over the ball, the big tease, and Lajos Detari booted it into the stands. Then another woeful Hungarian tackle led to a penalty being lashed home by Igor Belanov, who, like Yakovenko, proved a genuinely thrilling discovery.</p> <p>In the 62<sup>nd</sup> minute Hungary made their first substitution: off came Peter. Two young clowns on a couch thousands of miles away made obscene hand gestures in his direction. Then we urged the USSR, as if they were our proxies, to enforce more vengeance.</p> <p>With eight players from Dynamo Kyiv they were brilliant, far too nifty for disintegrating opponents. But in the second half the Soviets, all too human, relaxed a tad, saving energy for a deep run in the tournament. They still scored three more times, twice into an empty net after slick moves and once thanks to an own goal by Laszlo Dajka.</p> <p>USSR even missed another penalty. Vadym Yevtushenko blazed it so high the commentator wondered if he had misfired out of sympathy. But some people felt 6-0 was the least Peter and co deserved \u2013 and, at the final whistle, those people tore up a pile of unused stickers and staged an Argentina 78-style ticker-tape parade in their front room.</p> <p>Peter did not appear again in the tournament.</p>",

Even at this moment we dare not forget that war still rages over a quarter of the globe, that British, Americans, and Chinese are being wounded or killed every hour of the day, and that many of the men who have won this victory in Europe will have again to screw their courage to the sticking-point and risk their lives in the Far East. And that is not an easy thing to do. Yet when all is said it remains a moment of immense deliverance. It is not only that for the first time for five and a half long years Europe no longer hears the sound of guns, and our ships can sail Western waters without fear of mine or submarine. It is not only that never again need women in London \u2013 or Berlin \u2013 start at the sound of the telephone because they fear the siren. It is rather the knowledge that children are playing on swings in the camp at Belsen and that all over Europe the slave workers of Germany, the prisoners, and the persecuted are trudging homewards, weary, broken, but free. We have solved nothing. We are no nearer the Golden Age. But at least we have stopped the onrush of evil. We have won the right to hope.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/exhausted-relieved-yearning-for-change-britain-on-ve-day\">Exhausted, relieved, yearning for change: Britain on VE Day</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bishop Butler of the <a href=\"http://archives.dickinson.edu/sundries/butlers-analogy\">Analogy </a>would walk for hours in his garden at Bristol on the darkest nights pondering the narrow line which divides the rational from the insane. On one such occasion he stopped short and exclaimed to his companion</p> <blockquote> <p>Why might not whole communities and public bodies be seized with fits of insanity as well as individuals! Nothing but this principle, that they are liable to insanity, can account for the major part of those transactions of which we read to history.</p> </blockquote> <p>It is tempting to-day to explain away the events of the past ten years in some such terms. (Is not Himmler himself reported to have said that Germany was now a vast lunatic asylum?) But this will not do. We may not know the answer to the troubles of mankind but at least we know some of the causes. We have learnt, or should have learn, how dangerous is the spirit of nationalism when harnessed to the fact of power. We have seen what can happen to a great nation which surrenders to its leaders the freedom of thought and speech and conscience. We have ourselves felt the terrible power of destruction which man has acquired through science uncontrolled by wisdom. We have learnt (at what a cost!) that the platitudes of Geneva were the urgent truth, and that the brotherhood of man, the unity of nations, and the indivisibility of peace are facts which we can no longer ignore. But knowledge is not enough. Fear, hatred, nationalism and the like are not rational states but emotions which for a long time will continue to govern human behaviour and which will be fed by the chaos and misery in Europe. Hunger and unemployment are not the best schools for reason and tolerance, but they will have many pupils.</p> <p>Over wide areas of Europe the bridges are broken; there is no link with the past But the past was not all bad, and we must nurse the embers of our civilisation until it can blaze again as it did after other great European catastrophes \u2013 after the age of the Barbarians and the long night of the Dark Ages, and after the Thirty Years War. To-day, the people of Europe want above all peace, security, and a decent living. But they also want again that sense of freedom, progress, and enjoyment of life which gave meaning to the nineteenth century. In spite of all that has happened, in spite of our failures and hesitation, the majority still look to the West. But if we fail them again, if we do not help them by our policy and example, they will turn to the East, accepting the loss of their individual freedom as the price of security and social progress. We must prove that just as liberal democracy is a match for dictatorship in war, so in peace it can provide for its people all and more than is offered by Communism and National Socialism. But it will not be easy. If the war has tried our courage and endurance, the peace will test our wisdom and our faith.<br><em>This is an edited extract. <a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2020/05/05/First_light_8_May_45.jpg\">Read the article in full.</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c74bedd4d66f09c2237d4c58dbcdfbd360263dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c74bedd4d66f09c2237d4c58dbcdfbd360263dd/0_14_1888_1132/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Princess Elizabeth joins, from left, Queen Elizabeth, Winston Churchill, King George VI, and Princess Margaret, on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, 8 May 1945.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Princess Elizabeth joins, from left, Queen Elizabeth, Winston Churchill, King George VI, and Princess Margaret, on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, 8 May 1945.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1945/may/09/secondworldwar.fromthearchive1\">The War\u2019s Official End</a></h2> <p>9 May 1945</p> <p>The war against Germany officially came to an end at one minute past midnight this morning after a day of victory rejoicings by the people of Britain and her allies all over the world.</p> <p>Mr. Churchill\u2019s broadcast declaration that the war had ended and that we might allow ourselves \u201ca brief period of rejoicing\u201d set the seal on celebrations which were already under way.

The German Government surrendered unconditionally at 2 41 am. (French time) on the morning of Monday, May 7, when General Jodl signed the Act of Military Surrender at Rheims. This Act laid down that all operations would cease at 11 1 pm. (Central European time) on the evening of Tuesday, May 8, although, as Mr Churchill said in his broadcast, \u201cin the interests of saving lives the ceasefire began yesterday (May 7) to be sounded all along the front.\u201d But Mr Churchill also said that \u201chostilities will end officially at one minute after midnight to-night, Tuesday, May 8\u201d\u2026 or, to be strictly accurate, on the morning of Wednesday, May 9.</p> <p>This difference of an hour can, of course, be explained by the difference between Central European time and British time, but it does not alter the curious fact that \u201cofficially\u201d the war ended for Germany at 11 pm on Tuesday, May 8, and for us at one minute after midnight on the morning of Wednesday, May 9. If this were all, the matter would be simple enough. It has, however, been further complicated by the Russian insistence on a second ceremony in Berlin. The reason for this is plain. There was nothing wrong with the surrender at Rheims, but the Russians felt that it would impress their defeat more strongly on the German people if the ceremony took place in Berlin, their capital, and if the document were signed by Field Marshal Keitel himself, the Chief of the German High Command and the best known of the Nazi generals. There was also the fact that, surrender or not, the Germans were still resisting the Red Army in Czechoslovakia.</p> <p>But it was one thing to agree on a second surrender and another to keep the first a secret. The Associated Press has been blamed (a little unjustly) because its correspondent at Supreme Allied Headquarters revealed the news to Britain and America. The correspondent may have been at fault, but it is clear that even if he had not sent the message the news would still have got out. <br><em><a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2020/05/05/past_11.jpg\">Continue reading</a>.</em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/08/ve-day-victory-in-europe-denmark-1945-archive\">VE Day - two German cruisers await surrender: from the archive, 8 May 1945</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>The transition period: danger of spheres of influence<br></h2> <p>From our Diplomatic Correspondent <br>11 May 194<br><em>London, Thursday</em><br>While the last German units are laying down their arms all over Europe the rapid drama of events that led to their surrender gives place to a period of waiting upon political and diplomatic developments.</p> <p>In the liberated countries the change over from war to the transition period should not be technically difficult in theory, though the national and international problems are enormous everywhere. Elaborate preparations have been made for this transition by the Great Powers, the Governments in exile, and their resistance movements at home. The time has now come to apply these plans. In practice the application of the blue-print seems to bring its difficulties, and, even technically, some rather delicate situations have arisen in almost every count, in East and South-east Europe, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia especially.<br><br><strong>Future of Trieste</strong><br>The Government of the new Yugoslavia is violently opposed to the occupation of Trieste by Western Allied troops. It may be that a free port and international status for the town, with Italian sovereignty in cultural questions, would best serve the Allied and European cause, especially during the years of transition. If this cannot be, then there is a case for its return to Italy because an overwhelming majority of its inhabitants are Italian.</p> <p>With that view even the Italian Communists concur, although their desire for good relations with Yugoslavia is sincere, and they are prepared to make generous concessions. They admit that Yugoslavia has a just claim to the hinterland of Trieste and that a solution must be found in a partition between town and hinterland.</p> <p>In other zones, Norway, Denmark, and Holland notably, the change over from the war has gone more smoothly. Fears lest Norwegians should be unable alone to handle their transition period have proved to be unfounded and there has been no need to call on Sweden for the peaceful kind of assistance that she was prepared to give. Through effective organisation between the exiled Government and its delegates in Norway, the Norwegian underground movement was able to take over Government departments and local administration from the moment the war ended.</p> <p>In the conquered territories, Austria especially, difficulties again seem to be in the forefront. Although it was decided at Yalta that the control of Austria should be a joint one, with Russian, British, American, and French zones of occupation and a central Allied Control Commission sitting in Vienna, no British, American, or French representative of the Commission has yet arrived in Austria.</p> <p><strong>Allies and Germany</strong><br>Whether or not there can still be a technical explanation of the delay in Austria is comparatively unimportant. The serious question is whether there is to be a united Allied policy in Europe or whether one of the Great Powers is going to prejudice this hope by a one-sided power policy towards Austria and perhaps towards Germany too. Were there disunity of purpose and policy towards Germany, then, of course, the test case for all Allied unity would be lost.</p> <p>The problem is not one of experiment or compromise but of principle. The way it is handled will decide not only the future of Germany and Austria but whether there is to be real co-operation and agreement between the Allies. Will there be one Austria reorganised under the supervision of one Power and four Germanys with separate lives in the different zones of occupation.</p> <p>Such a solution would play directly into the hands of the Germans, and there are still amongst them a majority who even in defeat are thinking in terms of power policy alone. It would be not only a solution against the new forces in Europe, but the best guarantee of the continuation of Germany\u2019s imperialist consciousness which would concentrate first on the demarcation lines between the different Germanys.</p> <p>During the past few weeks there has been a clear and dangerous move towards creating spheres of influence within liberated Allied and conquered enemy territory. Such weight upon Europe would stunt her natural development as a variegated but harmonious whole. All history and not least that of the immediate past has shown that the Continent cannot be dominated by one force or ideology. This was so before Hitler and remains so after him.</p>",

The wounded men were rushed to Kings County hospital.</p> <p>The hospital, however, was grappling with the peak of the pandemic. The trauma unit was filled with Covid-19 patients, there was a shortage of intensive care beds. Doctors and nurses found space for the men wherever they could \u2013 hallways, pediatric units \u2013 and treated them amid the virus patients on tubes and ventilators, changing gloves in between.</p> <p>\u201cWe were completely overrun,\u201d said a physician who treated the gunshot victims in early April, and who asked to remain anonymous. \u201cThe whole department was filled with intubated patients in respiratory failure.\u201d</p> <p>Coronavirus has flooded health systems across the US since the beginning of March \u2013 cramming emergency departments and pushing staff and resources to capacity. But Americans have continued to suffer heart attacks, strokes and traumatic injuries. Mothers have continued to deliver babies.</p> <p>Some of these patients are contracting Covid-19 while being treated for a different ailment. Others are avoiding clinics and hospitals altogether and dying, unnecessarily, as a result.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are staying home, people are dying at home, it\u2019s an absolute travesty,\u201d said Dr Casey Clements, an emergency physician and infectious disease researcher at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.</p> <p>The impact is especially clear when it comes to chronic disease. Heart attacks and strokes are among the top reasons that people <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhamcs/web_tables/2017_ed_web_tables-508.pdf\">visit </a>the emergency department. And heart failure patients <a href=\"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.117.004873\">accounted</a> for almost a million hospitalizations in 2014.</p> <p>That\u2019s not the case right now. A Bellevue hospital physician, who asked to remain anonymous, said patients with heart issues or gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds are usually some of the most common cases at the hospital. Nowadays, he sees them rarely. \u201cI\u2019m worried people are decompensating at home,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Clements said the hospital was proactively telling patients they need to come in for severe issues. \u201cThey have a higher risk of that killing them than even if they got the [Covid] infection,\u201d he said.</p> <p>While no reliable statistics are available on how many Americans with non-Covid-related illnesses are avoiding the health system, doctors responding to an informal Twitter poll reported a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/angioplastyorg/status/1245892249101074432?s=20\">40% reduction</a> in heart attack patients. Cigna, the insurance company, said patients <a href=\"https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payer/cigna-patients-deferring-care-for-acute-needs-like-appendicitis-heart-conditions\">were</a><a href=\"https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payer/cigna-patients-deferring-care-for-acute-needs-like-appendicitis-heart-conditions\"> not actively seeking care</a> for urgent health needs, citing significant reductions in hospitalizations for GI bleeds, seizures and appendicitis.</p> <p>Though it is not known how many people with chronic disease have died in recent weeks, some may be <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/29/us/coronavirus-updates.html?type=styln-live-updates&amp;label=u.s.&amp;index=0&amp;action=click&amp;module=Spotlight&amp;pgtype=Homepage#link-26aee478\">driving up</a> the number of suspected Covid deaths \u2013 a grey area of the data that includes people who have died of related health issues.</p> <p>Meanwhile, another segment of the population is caught in the fray: pregnant women.

Only four showed symptoms.</p> <p>The fear of contracting Covid-19 has led a small number of pregnant women to avoid medical facilities altogether \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/21/nyregion/coronavirus-home-births.html\">opting</a> for home births and midwives. But that comes with its own risks, experts say, which can be more dangerous than the virus.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/giving-birth-coronavirus-us-hospitals-covid-19\">Strained hospitals and isolation: how coronavirus made giving birth even harder</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019s safe to deliver at home because we don\u2019t have the emergency system set up to make that transition smooth,\u201d said Dr Robert Smith, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the Michigan Medicine Von Voigtlander women\u2019s hospital.</p> <p>Meanwhile, trauma victims \u2013 those suffering from accidents, falls or violence <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5269564/\">that account</a> for at least 200,000 hospitalizations a year \u2013 have fewer options. These patients are usually taken in an ambulance to hospital and treated, whether or not they want to be exposed to coronavirus.</p> <p>But coming to the hospital can also lead to a diagnosis. The Kings County physician said he has found respiratory issues related to Covid-19 in Cat scans of older patients while looking for broken bones or internal bleeding from falls.</p> <p>Assessing the risk of contracting Covid-19 in a medical facility is difficult, and without that data, it can be hard for sick people to make decisions.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3049418/\">meta-analysis</a> of China\u2019s Covid-19 studies <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.20065730v1\">found</a> that infections contracted in hospitals accounted for 44% of the total cases. This included patients admitted to the hospital, but also health workers, who can both contract the virus and spread it to other people if not properly protected.</p> <p>Without national guidelines, the situation can vary drastically by facility. Michael Klompas, an infectious disease specialist at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital and Harvard Medical School professor, said he and his colleagues have been tracking each Covid-19 infection in the Harvard Pilgrim hospital system by date of diagnosis and exposure. So far, he said, hospital-acquired cases are \u201cfew and far between\u201d.</p> <p>Klompas said this success could be attributed to the strict hospital measures: universally masking patients and health workers, testing employees regularly, banning almost all visitors and screening patients. \u201cThe package seems to be working,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Many of those protocols are being followed across the country. While the US does not have designated Covid and non-Covid hospitals, as countries like China implemented, hospitals have devised their own methods to avoid the spread. Telemedicine emergency room visits help triage patients without contact, Clements said, insisting that the Mayo Clinic and the regional clinics it runs across the midwest remain largely safe.</p> <p>\u201cI feel much safer in my ER and hospital going to work than I feel in a public place,\u201d Clements said. \u201cThat\u2019s a universally felt sentiment among the doctors I know.\u201d</p> <p>At Bellevue hospital in New York City, the largest public hospital in the country, emergency department workers try to group patients together based on their diagnosis, and have two separate ICUs for Covid and non-Covid patients, the physician there said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/03/new-york-hospitals-coronavirus-bellevue\">The historic US hospital that fought cholera and Aids faces battle of its life</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But some patients do fall through the cracks. \u201cThe transmission to these patients is sometimes unavoidable,\u201d the physician said. \u201cSometimes we ask ourselves what\u2019s the risk of our patient coming up?\u201d</p> <p>In Michigan, Smith said the hospital reduced the number of in-house prenatal care visits, and recommended testing delivering mothers for Covid-19. Symptomatic mothers with the virus are put in negative pressure rooms to avoid contagion.</p> <p>As spring turns to summer, new Covid-19 hotspots have cropped up in cities such as Gallup, New Mexico, and Marion, Ohio, where access to healthcare is already strained.</p> <p>But physicians are clear: Covid-19 is not the only way that Americans are getting sick or dying.</p> <p>\u201cIt may not have been safe to be a non-Covid patient in the ER for a week or two,\u201d said a New York area doctor. \u201cNow it\u2019s safe but that perception remains.\u201d</p>",

I was advised that they didn\u2019t want to see them.\u201d</p> \n<p>She said it was \u201cnot unusual for ABF officers to not want to see passengers who may be unwell\u201d, and they could collect cards and details without coming face-to-face.</p> \n<h2>Paramedic taken to \u2018Covid-designated\u2019 area</h2> \n<p>The inquiry also heard testimony from two parademics who attended the ship on 19 March to take two passengers directly to hospital.</p> \n<p>Trainee paramedic Simeon Pridmore said he wrote in his case description that \u201con board testing showed negative for influenza and [the patient was] suspected Covid\u201d.</p> \n<p>Pridmore said the ambulance he was in was taken<strong> </strong>\u201cdirectly to a Covid-designated area\u201d when it arrived at Royal Prince Alfred hospital.</p> \n<p>Earlier, Tokovic<strong> </strong>said the ship\u2019s doctor, Ilse von Watzdorf, told her the ambulances were for patients with \u201cother conditions\u201d affecting their hearts and nerves, rather than Covid-19.</p> \n<p>She was questioned on why the patients were taken to RPA rather than St Vincent\u2019s, which was the usual hospital used for cruise ship passengers.</p> \n<p>Counsel assisting, Richard Beasley SC, said a transcript of her call showed she told paramedics: \u201cWe\u2019ve been requested by New South Wales [sic] to take them to the Royal Prince Alfred.\u201d</p> \n<p>Tokovic told the inquiry: \u201cWe always select St Vincent\u2019s, as just a common, \u2018please send them to St Vincent\u2019s\u2019\u201d.</p> \n<p>Beasley told the inquiry Royal Prince Alfred was \u201callocated as a \u2018Covid response hospital\u2019\u201d and asked if Tokovic if she recalled discussing that fact.</p> \n<p>Tokovic said she did not recall.</p> \n<h2>Passenger was on oxygen support</h2> \n<p>Another paramedic, Mathew Symonds, told the inquiry that when he boarded the ship and went to its medical centre on 19 March, one of the passengers was receiving oxygen treatment using \u201cnasal prongs\u201d, also known as an \u201coxygen nasal cannula\u201d.</p> \n<p>Tokovic had earlier told the inquiry that when paramedics boarded the ship, she heard the on-board doctor discuss one patient\u2019s \u201coxygen saturation\u201d with them.</p> \n<p>\u201cShe said that was what had changed throughout the night,\u201d Tokovic said</p> \n<p>Symonds said he then provided the patient with oxygen while transporting her, and the woman had had an oxygen saturation of 94%, which \u201cwith a comorbidity of emphysema\u201d would \u201cnot strike me as odd\u201d.</p> \n<p>The woman later tested positive for Covid-19 and died in hospital.</p> \n<p>In a written statement, Symonds said that when he boarded, the ship\u2019s doctor or nurse said other passengers had already left the ship and gone to hospital to get tested for Covid-19.</p> \n<p>Walker asked Symonds if he could have been confused and been told that \u201cswabs\u201d rather than passengers \u201chad been disembarked for testing\u201d.

  "<h2>Top story: Professor quits Sage after breaking rules</h2> \n<p>Hello, Warren Murray with you at the midpoint of another week in lockdown.</p> \n<p>Youth unemployment in Britain will reach the 1 million mark over the coming year unless the government provides job guarantees or incentives for school leavers and graduates to stay on in education, the Resolution Foundation warns. In the absence of action an extra 600,000 people under the age of 25 will swell dole queues with a risk of long-term damage to their career and pay prospects, it predicts. The thinktank\u2019s report says the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/06/risk-dole-queue-future-young-people-after-covid-19-crisis\">\u201ccorona class of 2020\u201d</a> \u2013 school leavers and graduates due shortly to join the labour market \u2013 is the most exposed age group to the likely unemployment surge.</p> \n<p>The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is preparing to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/rishi-sunak-preparing-to-wind-down-furlough-scheme-from-july\">wind down the coronavirus wage-subsidy scheme for workers from July</a> as part of government plans to gradually remove lockdown measures and lift restrictions on business activity. Treasury is understood to be examining several options including cutting the 80% subsidy to 60% and lowering the \u00a32,500 cap on monthly payments. Another option promoted by employers\u2019 groups would be to let furloughed staff work, with a smaller state subsidy. The Treasury has been working closely with No 10 as Boris Johnson prepares to outline plans on Sunday to bring Britain out of lockdown.</p> \n<p>Professor Neil Ferguson, the epidemiologist whose modelling helped shape Britain\u2019s coronavirus lockdown strategy, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-adviser-prof-neil-ferguson-resigns-after-breaking-lockdown-rules\">quit as a government adviser</a> after flouting the rules by receiving visits from a woman at his home. In a statement Ferguson said: \u201cI deeply regret any undermining of the clear messages around the continued need for social distancing to control this devastating epidemic. The government guidance is unequivocal, and is there to protect all of us.\u201d A statement from Imperial College London where he works said Ferguson \u201ccontinues to focus on his important research\u201d.</p> \n<p>In the Asia-Pacific region governments are moving to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/global-report-several-asia-pacific-nations-pass-covid-19-peak-and-plot-return-to-work\">get people back to school and work</a>. The Australian government has said it is seeking ways to reopen locked down businesses in a \u201cCovid-safe\u201d manner as it seeks to regain a million jobs lost since mid-March. Cafes, restaurants and retailers are expected to be among the first to be allowed to reopen. Hong Kong is to reopen schools, cinemas, bars and beauty parlours from Friday, with all 7.5 million residents to be given reusable face masks. In South Korea the government relaxed social distancing rules on Wednesday and students will return to school from Monday under strict rules about masks, disinfecting premises and temperature checks.

Rather than perpetrators or victims, it focuses on a relative bystander: a young office worker at a New York film production company. We follow this character, played by Julia Garner, through her demeaning routine: commuting in before daybreak, photocopying, printing, taking her male co-workers\u2019 lunch orders, clearing up leftover pizza from the meeting room (as the men come in for the next meeting, she is humiliatingly caught with a crust in her mouth).</p> <p>All this is interspersed with moments of everyday sexism and bullying communications from the Weinstein-like boss next door, who is not named or depicted. The Assistant doesn\u2019t amp up the drama or trowel on the message: instead, it shines a cold, clear light on a culture of complicity, silence and misogyny, not to mention the general dehumanising nature of office life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b26c3ba95cdba2ec798bfd8f28c1472efc64a0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b26c3ba95cdba2ec798bfd8f28c1472efc64a0c/0_0_3508_2451/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Micro-aggressions \u2026 Julia Garner in Kitty Green\u2019s The Assistant.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"699\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Micro-aggressions \u2026 Julia Garner in Kitty Green\u2019s The Assistant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Forensic Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The more real you make it, the more people are forced to interrogate their own role in all this</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Green\u2019s previous films were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/24/casting-jonbenet-review-documentary-kitty-green-sundance\">documentaries</a>, often centred on women, often stylistically adventurous. But for The Assistant, she opts for an unfussy approach. \u201cIn fiction film-making,\u201d she says, \u201cyou can use the closeup to amplify micro-aggressions, tiny moments that often get overlooked.\u201d Green still researched her story like a documentary, though, interviewing hundreds of working women worldwide. \u201cThe more real you make it, the more people are forced to interrogate their own role in all this.\u201d</p> <p>As well as its relevance to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\">#MeToo</a> moment, The Assistant is a type of film we\u2019ve been seeing a lot in US cinema lately: one concerned with everyday experience, particularly of those on the lower rungs if not the margins \u2013 yet reflective of modern America as a whole. Authentic settings and scenarios are prioritised over exaggerated dramatics or showy technique (if you want an example of the latter in terms of #MeToo, go see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/09/bombshell-review-margot-robbie-charlize-theron-nicole-kidman\">Bombshell</a>).</p> <p>Strikingly, many of these films are being made by and/or about women. We\u2019ve had the likes of Debra Granik\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/19/best-films-2018-uk-leave-no-trace\">Leave No Trace</a>, about a disturbed survivalist father and his teenage daughter living in the woods; Sean Baker\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/09/the-florida-project-review-sean-baker-walt-disney-world\">The Florida Project</a>, which follows a single mother living hand to mouth in an Orlando motel; Chlo\u00e9 Zhao\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/may/20/rider-review-bronco-rider-chloe-zhao-south-dakota-drama-documentary\">The Rider</a>, about a Dakota rodeo star suffering ahead injury.

But in the US, the idea of realism has never quite taken root. In commercial Hollywood especially, sociopolitical issues must always be refracted through the prism of genre: horror and sci-fi are the popular choices. Escapist cinema will always have its appeal. But perhaps, given America\u2019s current \u2013 and worsening \u2013 predicament, audiences are now starting to crave films that strive to make sense of the here and now, rather than distract from it.</p> <p>A further sign comes in the form of Eliza Hittman\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/09/never-rarely-sometimes-always-review-powerful-abortion-drama\">Never Rarely Sometimes Always</a>, about to have a streaming release in the UK. It concerns a Pennsylvanian teenager who travels to New York with her cousin to get a termination. As with The Assistant, the drama is low-key, almost documentary-like. There is no speechifying and no sentimentality: the characters don\u2019t learn a redeeming lesson, offer a political insight or bond in a heartwarming way. Instead, we\u2019re faced with the bare, brutal reality of the situation, which is compounded by the fact that these young women have no money, nowhere to stay, and little experience of the world.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjw_QTKr2rc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hjw_QTKr2rc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjw_QTKr2rc\">Watch a trailer for Never Rarely Sometimes Always</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>In 2007, the drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jan/11/worldcinema.drama\">4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days</a>, told a similar story about a woman seeking an illegal termination in Ceau\u015fescu\u2019s Romania. Modern-day America looks just as grim in Never Rarely Sometimes Always, which won an award at Sundance this year in the category of <a href=\"https://www.sundance.org/projects/award-winner-tba-20\">neorealism</a>. Tellingly, this was a new category at the festival.</p> <p>Could the prevalence of female film-makers have something to do with this wave? Opportunities have improved in recent years, it could be said, resulting in fresh perspectives on both the plight of women and the fragilities of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/men\">male identity</a> in modern America. It would be wrong, however, to assume that female film-makers naturally lean towards more personal, real-life subjects. A more likely factor, suggests Green, is the industry\u2019s lingering apprehension over women.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ll fund us,\u201d she says, \u201cwhen it\u2019s an area they think we have authority on. If I came to them with a dystopian sci-fi movie, they might not believe I could pull it off. But if I say it\u2019s about a 25-year-old assistant, they might think: \u2018Oh, OK, that\u2019s something she might know something about.\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The idea of a socially conscious, class-conscious cinema has always been deeply suspect in America</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hardship and poverty often go hand in hand with realism, and not just in front of the camera. One reason Italian neorealism caught on worldwide was because it was cheap to make. Perhaps this is why it never really took root in the US. \u201cThe idea of a socially conscious, class-conscious cinema has always been deeply suspect in America,\u201d says Paul Malcolm, film programmer at the UCLA Film and Television Archive.</p> <p>Perhaps, he adds, the US establishment was reluctant to admit to a foreign influence, especially when its focus on societal ills and the plight of the working class came with connotations of socialism and communism. A very slender realist thread does run through US film history, however, says Malcolm, who recently co-curated a film season entitled <a href=\"https://www.cinema.ucla.edu/events/2020/american-neorealism\">American Neorealism, Part One (1948 to 1984)</a>. This showcased the likes of John Cassavetes\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/20/shadows-cassavetes-arthouse\">Shadows</a> (a rough, jazzy race drama shot on the streets of 1950s New York), Jerry Schatzberg\u2019s The Panic in Needle Park (with the young Al Pacino as a 1970s junkie) and Barbara Loden\u2019s Wanda (in which she plays a runaway wife drifting through grimy 1970s Pennsylvania).</p> <p>To these we should add landmark African-American films such as Shirley Clarke\u2019s The Cool World and Charles Burnett\u2019s Killer of Sheep. The neorealist strand also runs through black and minority film-making, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/27/boyz-n-the-hood-review-blistering-humanitarian-classic-john-singleton\">Boyz N t</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/27/boyz-n-the-hood-review-blistering-humanitarian-classic-john-singleton\">he Hood</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/05/fruitvale-station-review-oscar-grant\">Fruitvale Station</a>. Part two of UCLA\u2019s film season is on hiatus due to the pandemic, but the list of potential candidates is getting longer by the month.</p> <p>Ironically, economic adversity could actually be a factor in the scarcity of US realism. It often becomes a calling card. Film-makers who have paid their dues and garnered critical acclaim through realist dramas are often tempted to bigger (but not always better) things. It happened to such great Italian neorealists as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/08/vittorio-de-sica-tragic-film-makers\">Vittoria de Sica</a>, Luchino Visconti and Roberto Rossellini.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bd5934a8ca8f99e2845ea337b42e904adbe67ed8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd5934a8ca8f99e2845ea337b42e904adbe67ed8/0_0_3543_2362/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thomasin McKenzie in Debra Granik\u2019s Leave No Trace.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emotional impact \u2026 Thomasin McKenzie in Debra Granik\u2019s Leave No Trace.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Collection Christophel/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is also happening to their current US successors. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/mar/01/kelly-reichardt-certain-women-director-michelle-williams-kristen-stewart-slow-cinema-maile-meloy\">Kelly Reichardt</a> successfully transposed her realist sensibility to such period pieces as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/apr/14/meeks-cutoff-review\">Meek\u2019s Cutoff</a>. Her latest, First Cow, may be set in the 1820s, but is no less a tale of graft and survival. On the other hand, Chlo\u00e9 Zhao is currently working on the Marvel movie Eternals, which is unlikely to ever be confused with The Rider. Still, while it marks a defection from the realist camp, the move also signals a big-budget vote of confidence in a rising film-maker. Kitty Green has plans but is not willing to discuss them just yet.</p> <p>Realism always seems to be born out of crisis. In Italy, it grew from the ruins of the second world war. Before that, a realist movement in art developed in the US and elsewhere in the 1930s, in the wake of the Great Depression. In fact, one of the most enduring fruits of social realism in the US was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jul/24/a-vision-shared-book-review-great-depression-photographers\">Farm Security Administration</a>, set up as part of Franklin D Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal in the mid-30s. Its remit was to document the impact of the Depression on rural communities, through photography as well as film. But its images went beyond the merely factual, often achieving the emotional impact of a drama.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4161c18de02bdee2ee0372afa21b648bc58ddf03\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4161c18de02bdee2ee0372afa21b648bc58ddf03/0_0_3504_2628/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Florida Project.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hardship and poverty \u2026 The Florida Project.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Freestyle Picture Company</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The prime example is Dorothea Lange\u2019s famous <a href=\"http://100photos.time.com/photos/dorothea-lange-migrant-mother\">Migrant Mother</a> photograph, which the Library of Congress captioned: \u201cDestitute pea pickers in California.

With a new depression looming, there could be more like it to come. If realism is what a crisis calls for, the conditions could hardly be better, which is to say worse.</p> <p>\u2022 The Assistant is out now on digital platforms.</p>",
  "<p><strong>David McWilliams:</strong> I think it is fair to say that capitalism \u2013 in the course of this unprecedented crisis \u2013 has been suspended. We are not going back to where we were, to business as usual. The state has come back, and this episode will not be forgotten by the electorate. I don\u2019t know where we are going, but one thing seems clear: we are not going back.</p> <p><strong>Yanis Varoufakis</strong>: I like this phrase: capitalism has been suspended. The last time capitalism was suspended in the west was during the second world war, with the advent of the war economy: a command economy that fixed prices. The war economy marked the transcendence of the standard capitalist model.</p> <p>But what we see now is not so much the suspension of capitalism. The rules of capitalism may have been suspended \u2013 all those sacrosanct policies are gone, the neat separation of fiscal and monetary policy is gone, the idea that public debt is a bad thing is gone.</p> <p>But the institutions that are necessary to build \u201cthe war economy without war\u201d so to speak \u2013 to suspend and transcend capitalism \u2013 those have not been put in place. There is a profound difference between saying: \u201cIt\u2019s all going to shit, so we don\u2019t expect you to stick to the rules,\u201d and saying: \u201cThe rules themselves have changed, and we must make new ones to prevent an economic collapse.\u201d All this talk of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/quantitative-easing\">quantitative easing</a> by the European Central Bank suggests that we remain very far from a war economy mindset.</p> <p><strong>DM: </strong>This is a familiar category error in Europe. If you are basing your economic policy on the willingness of people who are too traumatised and sick to borrow \u2013 which is the core logic of quantitative easing \u2013 then you have a very serious problem. A common image of quantitative easing is the hose: a huge monetary hose, with water gushing out to stop the fire of crisis. But the hose of monetary policy is limited by this little valve called the banks, a little valve called the credit committee, a little valve called the \u201cwillingness of business to borrow money\u201d. And ultimately, that hose of money becomes a trickle \u2013 and even that trickle stands to benefit the wealthy much more than the poor.</p> <p>So I take your point that despite the suspension of the rules, the infrastructure remains in place. But people across Europe are now saying: \u201cHey, there is an alternative.\u201d This second phase will be about how we move ahead in rethinking capitalism, in rethinking finance, rethinking how economies work and for whom \u2013 potentially toward a new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/nov/14/bretton-woods-1944-keynes-imf\">Bretton Woods-style settlement</a> for the entire global economy.</p> <p>So that\u2019s where we are: in the first year of the third decade of the 21st century. Looking out at the next decade, armed with history as well as economics, what do you think the global and European economy will look like?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1bf8f9edd6a1189e6e803fbd027f4071f177064b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bf8f9edd6a1189e6e803fbd027f4071f177064b/0_0_3266_2177/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yanis Varoufakis\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yanis Varoufakis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>YV:</strong> We are sitting on a saddle point, prepared to tip in either direction.

It would not be a federation, because \u2013 even though that is more necessary than ever \u2013 it is less likely than ever, because the centrifugal forces of the coronavirus crisis, the migration crisis, and the euro crisis are pulling us apart. But the alternative is to deploy the existing [EU] institutions in a way that can simulate a federated Europe, and we can do this tomorrow, if we so choose: to provide immediate cash to all those who are struggling in poverty, to invest in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/22/yanis-varoufakis-green-new-deal-can-unite-europes-progressives\">green transition</a>.</p> <p>There is a glimmer of hope here, because there is a profound difference between 2020 and 2010. Back then, when Ireland and Greece went belly up, there were remarkable dissimilarities between what our countries were experiencing and what Germany was experiencing, what Holland was experiencing. Today, Germany\u2019s industrial machine is broken \u2013 and was broken long before coronavirus hit. Two main industries \u2013 automobiles and machine tooling \u2013 were already in serious trouble. So the fact that Germany is now in the same pile of shit as the rest of us offers a glimmer of hope that they might say: what should we do? It\u2019s no longer: \u201cYour problem: here\u2019s the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/07/troika-build-greece-up-not-blow-apart-ceasefire\">Troika</a>.\u201d</p> <p><strong>DM: </strong>And we will send you the bill as well!

What do you think the impact of this particular trauma will have on, say, Italy \u2013 a founding member of the European Union, and a crucial part of Europe\u2019s emotional hinterland?</p> <p><strong>YV:</strong> Every time there is a crisis in Europe, Italian growth rates fall. Every time there is a problem, Italy sinks deeper into stagnation \u2013 with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/29/matteo-salvini-italy-league-party-master-campaigner-counts-cost-of-strategic-errors\">Salvini waiting</a> in the wings. If Frankfurt, Berlin, and Brussels fail again to move toward the positive scenario, Italy \u2013 not just Italy, but all of Europe\u2019s most devastated regions \u2013 will move again toward the neo-fascist right. In that case, all bets are off.</p> <p>This is the endpoint of the negative scenario: a giant domino effect, leading to the disintegration of the European Union. Not that the EU will cease to exist. Only that it will become irrelevant, like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Independent_States\">Commonwealth of Independent States</a>.</p> <p><strong>DM: </strong>Oh, I remember the Commonwealth of Independent States very well \u2026</p> <p><strong>YV:</strong> It still exists!

My sense is this model might be gone, and this style of globalisation along with it. I fear that the period when you could travel, engage, move \u2013 we might have reached the end of that open period.
