The decision by the Russian watchdog could affect hundreds of ventilators that have been produced since April as Russian hospitals sought new supplies to prepare for a flood of coronavirus cases. </p> \n  <p>Five coronavirus patients, some reportedly attached to ventilators, died in the early hours of Tuesday after a fire broke out at the St George hospital in St Petersburg. A fire last week at a Moscow hospital treating coronavirus patients also killed one person. That fire may also have been tied to a faulty ventilator. Both hospitals were reportedly using Aventa-M ventilators produced by a state-run factory in Russia\u2019s Urals region. </p> \n  <p>An April tender showed that last month the St George hospital had ordered 237 ventilators from the factory, which is the only manufacturer of that ventilator in the country. <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebbbe068f08d99d46a15f24\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/emmanuel-akinwotu\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T09:34:56.619Z\">10.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The continuing ban on public and religious gatherings in Nigeria has led to increasingly divided reactions from Churches in Nigeria. </p> \n  <p>In recent weeks, two of the most influential mega-church pastors in the country have grown in hostility to the government\u2019s lockdown measures, and questioned the severity of the pandemic altogether.</p> \n  <p>Bishop David Oyedepo, the founder of Living Faith Tabernacle has been among the most ardent critics of the ban on places of worship. Its main branch on the outskirts of Lagos draws 50,000 people. Earlier this week Oyedepo said the closure of churches while hospitals and markets were open amounted to a conspiracy against Churches. <br><br>\u201cThere is something wrong; for people to be allowed to be in the market for six hours and can\u2019t be in church for two hours. I can smell a rat,\u201d he said this week. \u201cThe voice of darkness is influencing people at various levels, targeting the church because the growth and expansion of the church is the greatest headache of the devil. I declare churches open.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Pastor Chris Oyakhilome\u2019s Christ Embassy is spread around the world with a main branch in Lagos seating 30,000 people. The pastor has been a consistent critic of measures to tackle the pandemic. \u201cThe lockdown is not science,\u201d he said in a sermon on Tuesday. The wearing of facemasks in public was \u201can embarrassment to science\u201d, he added. He has also previously linked Covid-19 to 5G mobile phone networks, fuelling a conspiracy theory that has spread around the world.</p> \n  <p>Both church leaders have faced criticism for their comments, not least from fellow church pastors. Pastor Tunde Bakare, the head of The Citadel Global Community Church, where the main hall in Lagos seats 5,000, this week donated two church buildings and a private residence to Nigerian states for isolation centres. </p> \n  <p>\u201cChurches with multiple facilities, rather than their leaders criticising the government should collaborate with them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey must be prepared to offer some of their halls to the government as isolation centres, in support of the efforts of the government.\u201d<br><br>In a further boost to Nigeria\u2019s Covid-19 response, the Catholic Church in Nigeria this week donated all of its 425 medical facilities across the country to the government to serve as isolation and treatment centres. Nigeria\u2019s predominantly deeply religious population is evenly split between Christians and Muslims according to government surveys. </p> \n  <p>The effect of the lockdown on religious life has been immense. Yet many Nigerian Christians are increasingly calling on the country\u2019s mega churches to donate their now empty auditoriums as the country rushes to build its health capacity. New infections of Covid-19 in Nigeria are growing, now at 4,787, doubling in the last 12 days. 158 people have lost their lives and 959 people have recovered. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebbba898f08d99d46a15ef8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T09:15:35.176Z\">10.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Reuters have filed this update from Poland:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>Poland will extend its strict border controls until 12 June due to the coronavirus pandemic, its Interior Ministry said on Wednesday.</p> \n   <p>Poland closed its borders to foreigners in March to stop the spread of the coronavirus and has extended the restriction four times since then.

Call it the Screen New Deal. Far more hi-tech than anything we have seen during previous disasters, the future that is being rushed into being as the bodies still pile up treats our past weeks of physical isolation not as a painful necessity to save lives, but as a living laboratory for a permanent \u2013 and highly profitable \u2013 no-touch future.</p> \n  <p>This is a future in which, for the privileged, almost everything is home delivered, either virtually via streaming and cloud technology, or physically via driverless vehicle or drone, then screen \u201cshared\u201d on a mediated platform. It\u2019s a future that employs far fewer teachers, doctors and drivers. It accepts no cash or credit cards (under guise of virus control), and has skeletal mass transit and far less live art. It\u2019s a future that claims to be run on \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d, but is actually held together by tens of millions of anonymous workers tucked away in warehouses, data centres, content-moderation mills, electronic sweatshops, lithium mines, industrial farms, meat-processing plants and prisons, where they are left unprotected from disease and hyper-exploitation. It\u2019s a future in which our every move, our every word, our every relationship is trackable, traceable and data-mineable by unprecedented collaborations between government and tech giants.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/may/13/naomi-klein-how-big-tech-plans-to-profit-from-coronavirus-pandemic\">Naomi Klein: How big tech plans to profit from the pandemic</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebb75ce8f08a55ecde58e3c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T05:00:58.509Z\">6.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Nature is healing in San Jose, California: </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan/status/1260410385452187649\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">oh my goat <a href=\"https://t.co/bvcaMIAHgz\">https://t.co/bvcaMIAHgz</a></p>\u2014 Helen Sullivan (@helenrsullivan) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan/status/1260410385452187649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 13, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebb7d148f08a55ecde58e5e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T04:54:56.152Z\">5.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Thailand has recorded zero new coronavirus cases for the first time since 9 March, Rueters reports. </p> \n  <p>Thailand has 3,017 confirmed cases and<strong> </strong>56 deaths, according to <a href=\"https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Johns Hopkins University</a> data. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a27ed82876dc5e0d74d4027305f041ef8a0eb5a\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a27ed82876dc5e0d74d4027305f041ef8a0eb5a/0_237_5296_3176/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Street food sellers stand behind plastic divider sheet in Bangkok, Thailand, Wednesday, 13 May 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Street food sellers stand behind plastic divider sheet in Bangkok, Thailand, Wednesday, 13 May 2020.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gemunu Amarasinghe/AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebb76a68f08d99d46a15d56\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T04:45:47.425Z\">5.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Confirmed deaths worldwide pass 290,000. </strong>According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 4,261,955 people around the world are known to have contracted the virus, while at least 291,964 have died since the pandemic began.<strong> </strong>The numbers, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to be significant underestimates due to suspected underreporting and differing recording and testing regimes.</li> \n   <li><strong>More than 147,000 Americans could die by early August \u2013 study. </strong>A newly revised coronavirus mortality model predicts more than 147,000 Americans will die from Covid-19 by early August, up nearly 10,000 from the last projection, as restrictions for curbing the pandemic are increasingly relaxed, researchers said on Tuesday. The current US death toll stands at 82,376.</li> \n   <li><strong>Brazil reports record deaths. </strong>Brazil reported a record <a href=\"https://covid.saude.gov.br/\">881 Covid-19</a> deaths in 24 hours on Tuesday, its health ministry said, taking its total to 12,400 and making it the world\u2019s sixth worst-affected country in terms of deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">figures</a>. Its total of 177,589 confirmed cases is the world\u2019s seventh-highest.</li> \n   <li><strong>US Senate threatens sanctions on China over Covid-19 accounting. </strong>US Republican senators proposed legislation Tuesday that would empower President Donald Trump to slap sanctions on China if Beijing does not give a \u201cfull accounting\u201d for the coronavirus outbreak. The legislation will give Trump 60 days to certify to Congress that China has provided a full accounting on the Covid-19 outbreak to an investigation that could be led by the United States and its allies, or a United Nations body like the World Health Organization.</li> \n   <li><strong>Wuhan prepares to test 11 million residents. </strong>The Chinese city of Wuhan, the original centre of the pandemic, plans to test all 11 million residents for coronavirus, according to local media. It was widely believed that this will be done within 10 days. However, Chinese media reports have given some more clarity today, suggesting that while there is a citywide testing plan, the time limit is for each region on staggered start times.</li> \n   <li><strong>Twitter announces employees will be allowed to work from home \u2018forever\u2019. </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/12/twitter-coronavirus-covid19-work-from-home\">Twitter will allow its employees to work from home \u201cforever\u201d</a>, chief executive officer Jack Dorsey said in a company-wide email Tuesday.

accounting\u201d for the coronavirus outbreak, AFP reports. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cThe Chinese Communist Party must be held accountable for the detrimental role they played in this pandemic,\u201d said Senator Jim Inhofe, one of the sponsors of the \u201cCovid-19 Accountability Act.\u201d</p> \n  <p>\u201cTheir outright deception of the origin and spread of the virus cost the world valuable time and lives as it began to spread,\u201d he said in a statement.</p> \n  <p>The legislation will give Trump 60 days to certify to Congress that China has provided a full accounting on the Covid-19 outbreak to an investigation that could be led by the United States and its allies, or a United Nations body like the World Health Organization.</p> \n  <p>Trump must also certify that China has closed its highest-risk wet markets and released Hong Kong activists arrested in post-Covid-19 crackdowns.</p> \n  <p>Without certification, Trump would be authorised under the legislation to impose sanctions like asset freezes, travel bans and visa revocations, as well as restricting Chinese businesses\u2019 access to US bank financing and capital markets.</p> \n  <p>\u201cChina refuses to allow the international community to go into the Wuhan lab to investigate,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, another sponsor of the bill.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThey refuse to allow investigators to study how this

  "<p>Do not feel guilty if you neglect your freezer. It happens to the best of us. \u201cI don\u2019t think I cleaned ours at home in a year until lockdown,\u201d confesses Nina Matsunaga, the chef-owner at the Black Bull Inn in Sedbergh, Cumbria. \u201cWe do our work freezer every couple of days.\u201d</p> <p>Like Matsunaga, many of us are looking anew at our freezers. Covid-19 has concentrated minds on saving money, minimising waste and shopping less frequently. People are storing more, collectively, and after a 30% spike in the month before lockdown, frozen food sales have continued to rise, according to the British Frozen Food Federation.</p> <p>You can work productively with whatever you have, from giant chest freezers to single compartments in small fridges. All sub-zero space is useful. But how many of us know how best to utilise what in her book <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-ice-kitchen-9780008385118.html\">The Ice Kitchen</a> Shivi Ramoutar describes as an \u201cunfashionable\u201d preservation method?

Slow freezing produces bigger crystals. Therefore, \u201cdrier\u201d ingredients freeze best. Peas thrive at -18C, while berry fruits turn to mush as they defrost. If you are making jam that is fine but freezing can ruin less flexible foods.</p> <p>For instance, the Michelin-starred chef Tom Kerridge, owner of the Butcher\u2019s Tap butcher in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, warns against freezing prime cuts \u2013 even high-grade, dry-aged beef \u2013 and particularly cheaper, watery steaks: \u201cThe muscle fibres get stretched and when it defrosts water comes out and that steak\u2019s juiciness becomes insipid. You\u2019ve broken its body.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>How do you protect food in that icy environment?</strong></h2> <p>Exposed to freezing air, loosely wrapped foods become dry, icy and corroded \u2013 so-called \u201cfreezer burn\u201d. To avoid that, place food in reusable silicone pouches or heavy plastic food bags, push as much air out as you can, and seal. Freeze each pack laid flat at first to minimise ice crystals. \u201cFlat surface areas freeze quicker,\u201d says Dan McGeorge, the head chef at Rothay Manor, Cumbria, which also allows you to arrange your freezer like a filing cabinet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d984d75859e4a52d606ebbff72949a9f9635f6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d984d75859e4a52d606ebbff72949a9f9635f6f/0_2163_4912_2944/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Food should be packed and sealed with as much air removed as possible to avoid freezer burn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Food should be packed and sealed with as much air removed as possible to avoid freezer burn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: jon11/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Sorry, filing cabinet?</strong></h2> <p>We tend to dump stuff in freezers where it sits for years, unlabelled and unidentifiable. Avoid that by labelling your flattish packs of rice, soups, sauces, shredded meat, chopped vegetables etc top right and storing them upright in a freezer drawer like files, rotating the oldest to the front. \u201cYou just riffle through to find the right pack and pull it out,\u201d says Lulu Grimes, the managing editor of BBC Good Food.</p> <p>Ramoutar\u2019s labels include the date the food was frozen (her general rule is to use everything within three to six months) and: \u201cHow I reheat it, so H for hob, O for oven, a temperature and time.\u201d You can buy special freezer labels, but paper, pen and sticky tape works. Avoid washable markers that rub off easily.</p> <p>Tip! From bacon rashers to egg whites, portion food into identifiable, user-friendly quantities. \u201cDon\u2019t freeze berries, sausages or meatballs in blocks,\u201d advises Si Toft, the chef-owner at the the Dining Room in Abersoch, Gwynedd. \u201cLay them on greaseproof paper, freeze for two hours, then bag them and take out individual handfuls.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Is there anything you should never freeze?</strong></h2> <p>Very little gets a flat no. Defrosted boiled eggs and raw potatoes are grim, however, and raw egg yolks go rubbery. \u201cWhisk them slightly and add a stabiliser \u2013 salt or sugar, depending on what you\u2019re doing with them,\u201d suggests Ramoutar.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Hard, mature cheeses and firm blues freeze better \u2013 they are fine in a toastie</p> <footer> <cite>Dan Bliss</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Generally, this is a question of preparation and end use. Can you be bothered to protect a food\u2019s textural integrity and will that matter?<em> </em>Deseeded, salted, sliced, rinsed, dried and frozen cucumber makes lovely crunchy batons for dips, but that is a lot of graft. Conversely, soft herbs that turn into dark mulch as they defrost taste fine in soups and sauces \u2013 as do finely chopped vegetables. Large pieces of raw vegetable become spongy in the freezer, which will not enhance your Sunday roast. Cook before freezing for a better result.</p> <p>Broadly, if you are going to blitz it later, if you just need the flavour and not the mouthfeel, you can freeze anything. But blanching soft herbs and vegetables \u2013 submerge briefly in boiling water, plunge them into ice, dry them thoroughly \u2013 helps to retain colour and flavour.</p> <h2><strong>Can you freeze milk and cheese?</strong></h2> <p>Milk, yes. Cheese is complicated. \u201cI don\u2019t recommend it,\u201d says Dan Bliss of the cheesemonger Paxton &amp; Whitfield. \u201cThe moisture and fat splits. Defrosted cheese has a weird texture. But avoiding food waste is close to my heart. Hard, mature cheeses and firm blues freeze better \u2013 they are fine in a toastie, and you get amazing pockets of molten cheese in scones when you add grated frozen cheese to the mix. With soft cheeses, make lasagne or sauces and freeze those.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>What is the problem with fish?</strong></h2> <p>Historically, \u201cfresh\u201d fish was regularly frozen at sea and defrosted for sale, which meant you could not freeze it at home without cooking it first (on the basis that you should not refreeze defrosted food). That is no longer always true. Ask your fishmonger for guidance or check the label, which may explain: \u201cThis product was previously frozen and has been restored to chill temperature under carefully controlled conditions. It is still suitable for home freezing.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I freeze whole spices to keep them fresh: tamarind paste, curry leaves, blitzed ginger, garlic and whole fresh turmeric</p> <footer> <cite>Sumayya Usmani</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ideally, freeze whole fish or skin-on fillets. Brining the fillets (10% salt solution, 20-40 minutes), helps to firm up the delicate flesh. Thoroughly dry the fish, and wrap it in a moisture-absorbing cloth and lots of clingfilm. \u201cWhen you think you\u2019ve got enough, double it. The secret is knowing it\u2019s covered,\u201d says the chef John Molnar, owner of the Cod\u2019s Scallops fishmongers and chip shops in Nottingham.</p> <p>Molnar dislikes freezing seafood \u2013 although, interestingly, freezing helps to tenderise fresh squid and octopus \u2013 but, carefully separated and wrapped, scallops work well: \u201cStacked like a packet of Rolos.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Do you really need fresh herbs and spices?</strong></h2> <p>If you want them to look great, yes. If you just need flavour, no. Soft herbs can be blitzed and frozen in cream or oil, and you don\u2019t need to carry a vast array of fresh spices to make curry. \u201cI freeze whole spices to keep them fresh: tamarind paste, curry leaves, blitzed ginger, garlic and whole fresh turmeric, which I grate when needed,\u201d says Sumayya Usmani, a Pakistani food expert and owner of Glasgow\u2019s Kaleyard Cook School.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63c33ce3e2a3a025967c606244697f46b4a76245\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63c33ce3e2a3a025967c606244697f46b4a76245/0_510_4479_2687/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spices and herbs can be frozen so they stay fresh.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spices and herbs can be frozen so they stay fresh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Natikka/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Can a freezer fast-forward my cooking?</strong></h2> <p>In endless ways, from using cooked frozen rice in stir-fries (undercook it by 20%, make sure you cool it quickly, freeze) to making soup in minutes from frozen spinach. Freezing flavoured butters (chipotle, jerk, sriracha, lime and chilli), is a simple flavour-boosting shortcut, while Matsunaga\u2019s freezer contains various raw doughs, fresh yeast (\u201cUse it straight from the freezer\u201d) and even parathas cooked in a dry pan. \u201cThey are fantastic defrosted and fried in ghee or butter \u2013 like a fresh batch.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e3eb66ec4b7fbdd5b590f5da4cf8d5de2d709a84\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3eb66ec4b7fbdd5b590f5da4cf8d5de2d709a84/0_844_3645_4557/800.jpg\" alt=\"Coconut yogurt can be whizzed up with chocolate, peanut butter and bananas and turned into ice-cream, as they do at Chick \u2018n\u2019 Sours restaurants, London.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coconut yogurt can be whizzed up with chocolate, peanut butter and bananas and turned into ice-cream, as they do at Chick \u2018n\u2019 Sours restaurants, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nina Firsova/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ramoutar makes no-cook, soft-set freezer jam (\u201cBlitz fruit, sugar and a little citrus and pop it in\u201d) and Carl Clarke, the chef-founder at Chick \u2018n\u2019 Sours, London, creates instant ice-cream by freezing, for example, bananas, dark chocolate, peanut butter and coconut yoghurt and combining them in a powerful, Nutribullet-style blender.</p> <h2><strong>If not prime cuts, can we freeze any meat?</strong></h2> <p>\u201cProfessionally, I\u2019m not keen,\u201d says Kerridge. Indeed, most chefs use the freezer as a tool for meat rather than for storage. If you want perfectly cubed pancetta or incredibly thin beef for carpaccio, firm the meat by freezing it for 30 minutes, then slice it. James Cochran, the head chef at 12:51 restaurant in London, uses a Microplane to grate frozen beef on to poached eggs (\u201clike fancy tartare\u201d) and bone marrow into mash, \u201clike parmesan, to add umami\u201d.</p> <p>Kerridge is more open to freezing meat at home \u2013 \u201ccured meats work fine\u201d \u2013 and in braises, curries or stews, where the sauce is the main flavour, it will be impossible to detect if the beef shin, ham hock or chicken breasts used were frozen. \u201cPacket chicken breasts are just protein which takes on the flavour of whatever they are cooked in,\u201d he says.</p> <h2><strong>Is the freezer a baker\u2019s secret weapon?</strong></h2> <p>It certainly lends itself to cool hacks (sorry). Chilling layers of a celebration cake makes them less fragile as you trim and level them, but also, says Rachel Stockley, the head chef at Baratxuri in Ramsbottom, Bury, if you freeze the icing as you complete each layer it produces a smooth, hard finish, so the cake \u201csits in those even layers the pros get\u201d. After glazing sausage rolls and pies, Andy Waugh, of Mac and Wild, London, freezes them for 30 minutes and repeats that before cooking: \u201cIt gives you an extra-lush finish.\u201d The freezer will even save wedges of dry fruit cake, advises Scott Paton, the head chef at Boringdon Hall, Devon: \u201cThe fruit plumps up and makes the cake moist.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>East Africa has suffered devastating floods after heavy rain in recent weeks, with Kenya particularly badly affected.</p> <p>Since March, almost 200 people have lost their lives to overflowing rivers and mudslides, while 40,000 have been displaced from their homes. The water levels in Lake Victoria have risen sufficiently over the past week to impact settlements along its banks. Further torrential rain across the border in Uganda has caused flash flooding on numerous rivers over the past few days, forcing people to flee to higher ground.</p> <p>In Mexico, a strong cold front heading south-eastwards across the country over the weekend spawned thunderstorms, which produced tornadoes. One powerful EF2 tornado, with estimated wind speeds of about 125mph (200km/h), touched down in Apodaca, Nuevo Le\u00f3n. Two people were killed and several injured as the tornado damaged buildings and overturned lorries. The same thunderstorm produced 60mm (2.3in) of rain, triggering landslides, which closed a major highway, while large hail damaged more than 100 cars.</p> <p>Unseasonably cold weather across large portions of the central and eastern US brought subzero temperatures and snow. New York reported falling snow on Saturday morning which tied with the record for the latest May snowfall in the city, back on May 9 1977.

The EU had become increasingly exasperated with Johnson\u2019s claims that there would be no checks.</p> <p>Fears that the UK would backslide on the deal were fuelled by the refusal of Johnson\u2019s government to allow the EU to open an office in Belfast to help implement and enforce the protocol.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/02/row-over-eu-office-in-belfast-threatens-to-derail-brexit-talks\">paymaster general, Penny Mordaunt, told the EU</a> such a presence would be \u201cdivisive in political and community terms\u201d.</p> <p>The Brexit deal is unpopular across the political spectrum in Northern Ireland because of the extra costs and bureaucracy it will entail for businesses.</p> <p>But it also means checks on the border with the Republic of Ireland will be avoided, something that has the support of Sinn F\u00e9in, and that exporters will have access to both the domestic and EU single market.</p> <p>The South Down Sinn F\u00e9in MP, Chris Hazzard, has said the British government must live up to the commitments made on Brexit, particularly in relation to the Irish protocol.</p> <p>\u201cThe British government cannot be allowed to renege on their legal obligations and must now work with the EU and the executive to ensure those commitments are fulfilled as a matter of urgency,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Business have called for some of the paperwork including the entry and exit declaration forms for imports and exports to be waived, along with health certificates for each product coming to a local supermarket.</p> <p>Analysis by the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium of deliveries from Britain to high-street supermarket chains in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland\">Northern Ireland</a> found that firms <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/05/eu-uk-brexit-talks-hurtling-towards-new-crisis-point-says-irish-foreign-minister\">could incur costs of more than \u00a3100,000 per lorry</a> unless special Brexit derogations were agreed.</p> <p>A Cabinet Office spokesman said: \u201cWe have always been clear that there will be requirements for live animals and agri-food, building on what already happens at ports like Larne and Belfast.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to work with NI businesses and the executive to ensure new admin procedures are streamlined and efficient. The protocol puts legal obligations on both sides. We are committed to complying with ours, just as we expect the EU to comply with theirs.\u201d</p>",

It comes on the day Sir Keir Starmer accused the government of being too slow to control the spread of Covid-19 in care homes. The Labour leader claimed that Boris Johnson misled MPs at PMQs when he said it \u201cwasn\u2019t true\u201d that up until 12 March the care home sector had been advised it was \u201c very unlikely\u201d to face an outbreak. </li> \n   <li><strong>Rishi Sunak didn\u2019t deny a Treasury report (<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/05/12/exclusive-treasury-blueprint-raise-taxes-freeze-wages-pay-300bn/\">leaked to the Telegraph</a>) that suggested</strong> <strong>the UK is more likely to get a U-shaped recovery rather than a V-shaped one</strong>.

Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. Sir Keir Starmer was widely expected to outperform Boris Johnson at PMQs, and in their first encounter last week he duly managed to do so with aplomb. On their second outing you would have expected No 10 to have given some thought to how to mount a more effective response. But there was not much evidence of this, and Johnson was duly skittled.</p> \n  <p>One problem for Johnson was that some of the usual tactics just don\u2019t work at Zoom PMQs. A outright untruth can win you temporary reprieve in the House of Commons if 300 MPs are cheering you on and it is going to take people a while to work out that you\u2019re mistaken or lying, but Johnson does not have the wall of sound protection he used to enjoy, and denying the existence of a document that Labour were able to circulate within seconds (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/may/13/uk-coronavirus-live-millions-health-conditions-return-to-work-pmqs-covid-19-latest-news-updates?page=with:block-5ebbdc9c8f08a55ecde591b4#block-5ebbdc9c8f08a55ecde591b4\">12.47pm)</a> was just an elementary error. Starmer is not infallible, and there are ways of beating him in an argument. But suggesting that Starmer (the archetypal \u201cswot\u201d, as the PM would put it) is wrong on a point of fact - how naive can you get?</p> \n  <p>Having exhausted denial as a tactic, Johnson (in exchanges two and three) resorted to ignoring the question. But this, again, is a less reliable tactic in a largely silent House of Commons, and Johnson\u2019s failure to be able to address the point raised by <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/05/12/governments-handling-covid-19-british-disaster/\">the Ambrose Evans-Pritchard column in the Telegraph, </a>or to be able to give a sensible explanation of the excess death figure, left him looking unimpressive. In the final three answers Johnson was on slightly less shaky ground. There is an argument for not using the global death comparisons chart (although one that\u2019s harder to make if you\u2019ve only just abandoned it now), he did at last acknowledge the childcare problem, and he promised to publish Sage advice. But his very partial recovery was too late. By then the damage was done.</p> \n  <p>Again, none of this was particularly surprising.

Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Diamond said the UK was \u201cat the higher level\u201d for coronavirus deaths in Europe, but that he was not prepared to say it had the worst record</strong>. Asked directly if the UK had the highest coronavirus death toll in Europe, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m not prepared to say that at this time. I don\u2019t think that we have very good data in the UK and I do think that there is no doubt that we are, if you like, at the higher level for deaths. I\u2019ve no problem about saying that.</p> \n   <p>Because of the great difficulty in understanding exactly whether we\u2019re comparing apples with apples, or apples with pears, I\u2019m not prepared to say that the UK has the highest.</p> \n   <p>So, for example, if we look at the comparison with Italy, the most recent adjustment made in Italy only took us up to the end of March. We are much further on ...</p> \n   <p>So there are very, very different data collection strategies in different countries. It will be some time, because of the way that other countries report, that I\u2019m able to give an authoritative answer to that question.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Diamond also explained why comparing death rates in different countries could be misleading. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Let\u2019s just start with age. We know that, above all, this is a disease which really impacts the elderly members of society. So if you population has a radically different age structure, then one needs to do something about controlling for that. Ireland, for example, has a much younger age structure than some other parts of Europe.</p> \n   <p>Secondly, we know from ONS data it\u2019s a pandemic which started in London. It takes much longer to move through rural areas. We need to know something about the degree of urbanisation, the degree to which people are living close together.</p> \n   <p>These are areas that you really need to take into account, as well as the points that we\u2019ve that we\u2019ve already talked about, which are about making sure that the recording is comparative.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The UK Statistics Authority has backed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/12/uk-coronavirus-live-sunak-expected-to-extend-furlough-scheme-as-lockdown-confusion-continues?page=with:block-5ebad4de8f08d99d46a15999#block-5ebad4de8f08d99d46a15999\">Downing Street\u2019s decision to stop publishing a daily global deaths comparison chart.</a> </strong>At the hearing<strong> </strong><strong>Ed Humpherson</strong>, director general for regulation at the authority, was giving evidence alongside Diamond and he was asked specifically about the move, which means No 10 no longer presents a daily chart showing the UK as having the worst record in Europe.

coronavirus crisis.</p> \n  <p><strong>The Association of Independent Festivals</strong> (AIF), which represents 65 festivals in the UK, including <strong>Gloucestershire\u2019s 2000trees</strong>, <strong>London\u2019s Meltdown</strong> and <strong>Sheffield\u2019s Tramlines</strong>, reports 92% of its members saying they face costs that could ruin their businesses as a result of cancelled events, with the vast majority (98.5%) not covered by insurance for cancellation related to Covid-19.</p> \n  <p>Costs include potential refunds of up to \u00a3800m for events that were due to take place this summer, and average non-recoupable costs of \u00a3375,000 per festival for overheads such as marketing, staffing and advertising. </p> \n  <p>A member survey has revealed that the sector could be facing redundancies of 59% on average and will lose more than half of its workforce between September 2020 and February 2021 without support.</p> \n  <p>The AIF chief executive, <strong>Paul Reed</strong>, says that many independent festivals aren\u2019t able to access funds through the government\u2019s coronavirus business interruption loan scheme because they are unable to meet eligibility criteria, while the bounce-back loan scheme, capped at \u00a350,000, doesn\u2019t adequately cover what they need to stay afloat without income for this year. </p> \n  <aside

But the national parks are closed and travel banned due to the coronavirus, so for five days Wood and Dyer see no one except for a few park rangers, dozens of pademelons (a squat, short-tailed wallaby) and a hungry platypus that ignored them in favour of hunting in a tarn, two humans being no competition to the lure of a full belly.</p> <p>\u201cIt was just incredibly quiet,\u201d Wood says. \u201cYou do get this feeling of real privilege that you\u2019re getting that place pretty much to yourself.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b2823ce6ff33e8cf61033180dcdf49ef2e9249cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2823ce6ff33e8cf61033180dcdf49ef2e9249cd/0_71_3111_1867/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Close-up of a pencil pine\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pencil pines are one of five ancient conifer species endemic to the Tasmanian highlands.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The pencil pines are one of five species of conifer endemic to Tasmania\u2019s high country, the most well-known of which are king billy pines (<em>Athrotaxis selaginoides</em>).

The trigger, says Wood, appears to be two successively hotter summers, although there\u2019s no consensus on the exact cause. This year the seeding was \u201cpatchy\u201d, with pencil pines on higher and drier areas not producing pine cones, and cheshunt pines, which often grow nearby, not seeding at all.</p> <p>It means that while Tasmania will likely deliver on the prerequisite for hotter summers, due to the climate emergency, the accompanied drying out of the highlands could leave the pencil pines too stressed to seed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41f08076fd5e64a6911d6a464e0745c6dc7dee88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41f08076fd5e64a6911d6a464e0745c6dc7dee88/1156_0_1937_2421/800.jpg\" alt=\"The shape of a pencil pine tree\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pencil pines seed only every few years when specific environmental conditions are met.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That is why the 2020 masting was so important. An ambitious plan involving teams of volunteers, visiting specialists from the Royal Botanic Gardens in Edinburgh, helicopters and arborists was formed in December and tree enthusiasts on Facebook were mobilised to monitor conifer flowering. Those plans were spiked when the pandemic was declared, and Wood got permission for the two-person operation focused just on the pencil pines.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/15/dinosaur-trees-firefighters-save-endangered-wollemi-pines-from-nsw-bushfires\">'Dinosaur trees': firefighters save endangered Wollemi pines from NSW bushfires</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pencil pines are particularly tricky for seed gatherers, because they grow in the wild as suckers.</p> <p>\u201cMost of the stands of the trees that you see in Tasmania are all clonal,\u201d Wood says. \u201cThey sucker from their roots and spread that way so large strands of trees generally have only a couple of individuals.

  "<p>The fairway was newly mown and welcoming; a yellow flag, 350 yards away, flickered in the chill breeze descending off Dartmoor as the sun made an appearance through wispy clouds. With driver in hand and provisional ball in pocket I stepped on to the first tee at Okehampton Golf Club and, for the first time in a couple of months, attempted to hit a golf ball further than the seven yards available in the back garden. What a relief to swing that club, not just because the ball was soon airborne in vaguely the right direction; here was a glimmer that life might one day return to normal.</p> <p>The club pro, Ashley, had greeted us on the first tee. They do not usually have a starter at Okehampton, perhaps the friendliest, unstuffiest club in Devon. But this felt like a special occasion; the club was coming back to life and so too were its golfers. The course was in superb condition, the fairways neatly manicured, the bluebells in bloom, the greens fast and true and treacherous (still). Ricki, the course manager, had still been out there cutting the grass at 9pm on Tuesday to make sure everything was perfect; neither he nor the greenkeeper, Mike, had been furloughed; instead this pair had obviously been busy over the past two months.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82c21ff811fa44c22509cd394829ad05c74dcb16\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82c21ff811fa44c22509cd394829ad05c74dcb16/0_0_6468_4312/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vic Marks and his playing partner, Gavin, are greeted at the club house.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vic Marks and his playing partner, Gavin, are greeted at the club house.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ashley has not sold any golf gear in that time or given any lessons but he was beaming anyway now that the course was reopening.

At some courses it is frowned upon to put golf shoes on in the car park.

Avoidable household and business insolvencies can weigh on growth for years to come. Long stretches of unemployment can damage or end workers\u2019 careers as their skills lose value and professional networks dry up, and leave families in greater debt. The loss of thousands of small- and medium-sized businesses across the country would destroy the life\u2019s work and family legacy of many business and community leaders and limit the strength of the recovery when it comes.</p> \n   <p>These businesses are a principal source of job creation\u2014something we will sorely need as people seek to return to work.

A horrific expos\u00e9 in the Montreal Gazette revealed that a local nursing home \u2013 known by its French initials as a CHSLD \u2013 had <a href=\"https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/records-reveal-chaos-in-the-days-before-staff-abandoned-the-herron/\">concealed the deaths of 31 seniors</a>.

On Saturdays and Sundays, he worked as an orderly inside whichever CHSLD his temp agency dispatched him to that week.</p> <p>He lived with his family in Montreal North, one of the poorest neighbourhoods in all of Canada. It is a popular destination for asylum seekers \u2013 many of whom crossed the US\u2013Canada border on foot shortly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/20/over-15000-have-crossed-us-canada-border-amid-deportation-fears-under-trump\">after American president Donald Trump took office</a>. Half of the neighbourhood\u2019s residents are members of a visible minority, and 42% are immigrants.</p> <p>Like Fran\u00e7ois, many asylum seekers are now working, without citizenship status, inside of Quebec\u2019s seniors residences. And then they\u2019re coming home at the end of their shift, to crowded apartments they share with friends and family, inside of <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-cartierville-apartments-cockroaches-bed-bugs-1.3939127\">shoddily maintained apartment buildings</a>.</p> <p>Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-covid-cross-contamination-1.5556946\">the province admitted</a> that its effort to manage staffing shortages by moving workers around the long-term care network could be spreading the virus. Montreal North feels the consequences of that. One in five Montrealers infected with Covid-19 are healthcare workers \u2013 none of whom are receiving danger pay. In Montreal North, 23% are infected, said community organizer Will Prosper.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s these people who are still taking care of us, when not too long ago they were the people who we wanted to kick out,\u201d said Prosper.</p> <p>Other areas of Montreal badly hit by Covid-19 share similar traits with Montreal North: low-income, large immigrant communities, many people of colour, poor quality housing. Montreal\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.crarr.org/?q=node/20102\">Centre for Research-Action on Race Relations</a> is demanding the federal and provincial governments collect data on the race and income level of Covid victims. </p> <p>Nargess Mustapha, also a community organizer in Montreal North and the president of youth empowerment organization Hoodstock, doesn\u2019t need data to see how Covid-19 has further entrenched existing inequalities. She\u2019s on the ground, along with an army of young volunteers, distributing mask-and-sanitizer kits and food hampers to members of her community.</p> <p>She recites a long list of reasons why Covid-19 has struck her neighbourhood so deeply: a lack of health services, inadequate transit access, people living in crowded apartments, poor relations with police \u2013 especially now that officers can hand out $1,500 fines to those not respecting self-isolation measures.</p> <p>Meanwhile, 42% of homes are single-parent households, which makes things like child care for essential workers very complicated. And, a lack of internet access makes it tough to get government aid and information being distributed almost exclusively online.</p> <p>\u201cBeing able to socially distance is a sign of privilege,\u201d Mustapha said in French, pointing out that the population density of one neighbourhood sector rivals that of New York City\u2019s densest borough. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to apply those rules in Montreal North.\u201d</p>",

Lesotho\u2019s lockdown started on 30 April and lasted until 5 May. The lockdown was lifted against the advice of the inter-ministerial committee which said the country was not prepared to deal with a possible outbreak since its quarantine facilities comprised just 148 beds.</p> <p>As news reached the capital, Maseru, some people expressed fears that the country\u2019s health system was ill-equipped to handle Covid-19.</p> <p>The health ministry said on Wednesday it was waiting for results to come back from South Africa.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/its-just-beginning-here-africa-turns-to-testing-as-pandemic-grips-the-continent\">\u2018It's just beginning here\u2019: Africa turns to testing as pandemic grips the continent</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cTo date, we have sent 597 specimens for testing at NICD, 295 are negative and 301 are still pending.\u201d</p> <p>The ministry said it would continue to carry out active case-finding through screening and testing of all suspected cases at designated points of entry and at health facilities while monitoring those in quarantine.</p> <p>There are also fears that more cases could arise as many Lesotho nationals continue to ignore the government\u2019s pleas not to illegally cross back into the country from neighbouring South Africa, which has been hit harder by the virus. South Africa has the highest number of Covid-19 cases on the continent, and by Wednesday had recorded 11,300 cases and more than 200 deaths.</p> <p>Last week Lesotho\u2019s prime minister, Thomas Thabane, expressed disappointment that hundreds of people were taking advantage of the two countries\u2019 porous borders to illegally come back into Lesotho. Thabane said such actions could sharply increase the number of infections in Lesotho.</p> <p>Health ministry official Makhoase Ranyali-Otubanjo said last week alone 1,000 people had returned from South Africa, whose border with Lesotho remained closed because of the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cMore than 1,000 Basotho arrived from South Africa over the past few days: 664 came through porous borders from 3 to 7 May 2020, 500 came from South African prisons and 97 were held back by the lockdown in that country,\u201d Ranyali-Otubanjo said.</p> <p>Those returning were screened, she said, and 13 taken to isolation facilities after exhibiting symptoms.</p> <p>Last week the government also said it was looking to the hospitality industry in an effort to increase the number of available beds. </p> <p>The situation is not helped by a delay in setting aside funds for the pandemic response, which is reliant on the eventual passing of the country\u2019s 2020/21 budget.</p>",

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Global confirmed death toll exceeds 292,000</h2> <p>The number of people known to have died since the pandemic began has reached at least 292,316, according to researchers at <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/\">Johns Hopkins University</a>. They say at least 4,278,180 people are known to have been infected. The figures are likely to significantly underestimate the true scale of the pandemic because they are based on official and media reports.</p> <h2>Chinese authorities draw up plan to test 11 million people in Wuhan</h2> <p>Chinese authorities are preparing to test 11 million people in Wuhan after a small outbreak this week. The city in Hubei province, where the virus is believed to have originated with the first recorded cases, had reported few daily cases since early March and none since early April, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/now-it-starts-again-new-coronavirus-outbreaks-spark-unease-in-china\">until a cluster of six was confirmed at the weekend</a>. Fearful of another outbreak and a return to the draconian lockdowns, the authorities are drawing up plans for \u201c10 days of battle\u201d, directing each district of Wuhan to develop and submit plans to test all their citizens.</p> <h2>New US coronavirus hotspots appear in Republican heartlands</h2> <p>New <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/new-us-coronavirus-hotspots-republican-heartland-areas\">coronavirus hotspots are emerging</a> in Republican heartland communities across multiple states, contradicting Donald Trump\u2019s claims that infection rates are declining across the nation. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/13/michigan-rightwing-militia-groups-stay-at-home-protest\">rightwing militia groups in Michigan</a> plan to rally at the state capitol building on Thursday to protest Democratic governor Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s stay-at-home orders.</p> <h2>Real care home death toll in UK double official figure, study says</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/coronavirus-real-care-home-death-toll-double-official-figure-study-says\">More than 22,000 care home residents</a> in England and Wales may have died as a direct or indirect result of Covid-19, academics have calculated \u2013 more than double the number stated as dying from the disease in official figures.</p> <h2>More than 10,000 new cases registered in Russia</h2> <p>Russia registered 10,028 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday. Despite the steady rise in new cases, Russia\u2019s reported mortality rate is significantly lower compared with other European countries hit hard by the pandemic, with 96 new deaths and a total of 2,212 dead from the coronavirus as of Wednesday.</p> <h2>Pompeo arrives in Israel for talks on annexations</h2> <p>The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/mike-pompeo-to-break-travel-hiatus-for-hours-long-visit-to-israel\">has arrived in Israel</a> amid the coronavirus pandemic to discuss US-backed plans to annex large parts of the Palestinian territories. The single-stop visit \u2013 Pompeo\u2019s first in nearly two months \u2013 will last just a few hours, with a small US team afforded exemptions from strict Israeli coronavirus restrictions that require any arrivals to self-isolate for two weeks.</p> <h2>US nursing homes seek legal immunity as Covid-19 spreads \u2018like brushfire\u2019</h2> <p>The US nursing home industry is <a href=\"theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/us-nursing-homes-legal-immunity-coronavirus\">clamouring for legal immunity</a> during the coronavirus pandemic, even as horror stories from hard-hit facilities enrage families, consumer advocates and the American public. Tricia Neuman, the senior vice-president of the Henry J Kaiser Family Foundation, said: \u201cThe liability issue is exposing a longstanding tension between consumer advocates, who want to see the standards enforced, and owners, who are worried about the financial implications of a lawsuit.\u201d</p> <h2>Spanish death toll rises slightly</h2> <p>Spain\u2019s daily death toll <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/13/coronavirus-live-news-brazil-reports-record-881-deaths-as-wuhan-prepares-to-test-11m-residents?page=with:block-5ebbcc178f080c7274539fcd#block-5ebbcc178f080c7274539fcd\">rose slightly on Wednesday</a> to 184, from 176 on Tuesday. The country\u2019s overall death toll from the disease rose to 27,104, according to the health ministry\u2019s daily report, while the overall number of diagnosed cases rose to 228,691 from 228,030 the previous day.</p> <h2>Plans announced for relaxation of border controls in Europe</h2> <p>Plans were announced to relax border controls in Germany from Saturday, with the aim of having free travel in Europe from 15 June, though controls could be reimposed if there are new outbreaks. Poland, which closed its borders to foreigners in March, has extended its border controls until 12 June. Iceland also expects to make widespread changes to its immigration restrictions on 15 June, with arrivals expected to choose between a coronavirus test on entry or a 14-day quarantine.</p>",

about Peter Dutton\u2019s latest security bill:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The proposal to reduce the age of minors who may be subject to questioning from 16 to 14 years and the conferral of powers on police to apprehend and detain persons for the purpose of bringing them in for compulsory questioning also requires detailed scrutiny by the Law Council, amongst the many other amendments.</p> \n   <p>The Law Council is concerned that the government is now rushing the Bill, despite having had over two years to develop the re-designed questioning legislation since the PJCIS tabled its report in May 2018.</p> \n   <p>Now there is a sense of urgency given that ASIO\u2019s current questioning powers are due to sunset in 7 September, and the amendments are set to commence by or before that date.</p> \n   <p>This is not a Bill to be hurried through.</p> \n   <p>The Law Council will need to carefully scrutinise the Bill and we look forward to providing a comprehensive

for ordinary Australians trying to uphold their rights against wealthy defendants with vastly greater resources.</p> \n   <p>Just last November the federal court ruled in favour of the three lead applicants in a class action of more than 1,350 women who sued Johnson &amp; Johnson and two subsidiaries for negligence in relation to pelvic mesh implants.</p> \n   <p>It\u2019s no coincidence this inquiry was first proposed in March just days after 10,000 victims of the Morrison government\u2019s cruel robodebt scheme signed up to a class action to defend their legal rights.</p> \n   <p>Contrary to government claims, research by commercial law firm Allens found the total number of class action filings was actually down 20% in 2019. </p> \n   <p>Shareholder actions were actually down 63% and so far this year there are just three new shareholder cases \u2013 none of which relate to Covid-19 matters.</p> \n   <p>Significantly, the biggest cause of new cases in 2019 came from consumer actions arising from the banking royal commission that the government voted 26 times to prevent.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time

question time, <strong>Tony Burke </strong>had a \u2018personal explanation\u2019 to make and spills some tea about the weekly meetings the opposition leadership has been having with the government leadership (which was the compromise offered after Anthony Albanese was denied a seat on the national cabinet, and the parliament wasn\u2019t sitting). After this, I am not sure if those weekly catch-ups will be ongoing.</p> \n  <p>Asked if he had claimed to have been misrepresented (the standard reason for a personal explanation), Burke says he does:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Yesterday during debate on an amendment I had moved, which would have demanded the government produce the new sitting calendar, the leader of the House (Christian Porter) said statements I had personally made were inaccurate, by claiming that in private meetings, which I had personally attended, the government had, and I quote the leader of the House, \u2018clearly explained there will be additional sitting weeks\u2019, end quote.</p> \n   <p>This statement is false.</p> \n   <p>While I would normally not disclose the conduct of private meetings, given the leader of the House has made this false statement about me to the House, I wish to confirm the following four points.</p> \n   <p>One, in the meeting with the leadership of the government, on 7 May 2020, the government did not state that it would provide additional sitting weeks, but merely that it might.</p> \n   <p>Two, this was to be based on an assessment, that was to be taken, and I quote, \u2018a couple of days\u2019, end quote, after parliament had risen, based on whether there had been an outbreak of Covid-19 as a result of these sittings.</p> \n   <p>Three, given the virus has an incubation period of weeks not days, this position was always absurd. </p> \n   <p>Four, the minister\u2019s misrepresentation of these statements also presumes the government has been forthcoming with accurate information at these meetings, which is challenged by the fact that on issues as straightforward as whether there would be changes to jobkeeper, the government has provided information at these meetings which was proven to be false the very next day.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time

And so any suggestion that Australia\u2019s agricultural exports are the subject of government subsidisation is rejected. </p> \n   <p>And these are the points that we make directly as part of a comprehensive and strategic partnership that was concluded many years ago and we are continuing to use the channels of that relationship and that partnership to be able to progress those matters as well as directly with the relevant authorities in China regarding their anti-dumping review in relation to barley. </p> \n   <p>Similarly, relations in matter to abattoirs are important to progress. They relate to what is claimed to be paperwork and administration issues in relation to Australian meat exports and we will continue to advocate and set out the Australian case clearly.</p> \n   <p>Let me be clear about one thing. Australia stands firmly behind our agricultural producers and we stand firmly about where we see the role of the Australian economy in the broader world. We have great confidence in our outlook as a trading nation and we engage with all partners in good faith with the purpose of ensuring the increasing global trade.</p> \n   <p>That is the basis for our relationship the Chinese government when it comes to a comprehensive strategic partnership. It works across many different areas and has been a highly successful agreement. From time to time there will be differences in views and we will progress them constructively in the national interest, always in the national interest.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T04:23:02.806Z\">at 5.23am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebb741d8f08a55ecde58e37\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T04:16:09.585Z\">5.16am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Michael McCormack</strong> is at the dispatch box, talking about fibre and whatnot, but is only serving to remind me that his speeches are a pretty wonderful substitute for All-Bran.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T04:25:33.666Z\">at 5.25am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebb73f88f080c7274539d7e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T04:14:10.757Z\">5.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And as you can see, we are back to the non-answers, non-acknowledgement, and the old \u2018deflect and attack\u2019 lines.

In relation to mental health and the coronavirus epidemic in Australia, in particular we have invested $669m in telehealth of which I\u2019m advised 47.7% of all consultations in the previous week with regards to standard mental health items were conducted over the phone. </p> \n   <p>In addition to that, what we have also seen is that general telehealth items have very significantly been for mental health. </p> \n   <p>So it doesn\u2019t have to be confined to the particular mechanism which the member outlines. </p> \n   <p>What we have opened up with telehealth is a much broader ability to access services in conjunction with the services provided through telehealth, we have also made sure that there were psychological and psychiatric items that were also made available. On top of that, there was a $74m investment focusing on support services for people, mostly online or through telehealth, through organisations such as the Black Dog Institute for healthcare workers, Origin for young people, Lifeline, Kids Line, so many other different support groups. And in particular, Beyond Blue has led the coronavirus activity. </p> \n   <p>So with to other proposals, the government will always consider them. What we have done already is on the advice of the mental health officers, the chief medical officer, in particular the chair \u2013 or CEO \u2013 of the National Mental Health Commission and the prime minister\u2019s suicide prevention adviser, Christine Morgan, establish the arrangements which are in place. These have been critical to help save lives and protect lives during what is a difficult period and where there are proposals we\u2019d always review them. </p> \n   <p>What we have done so far, I would say, is potentially world leading and in particular the national cabinet will be considering the national mental health pandemic plan this week and we are making very good process with the states and I want to thank the prime minister for his support and his leadership in drawing that into the national cabinet.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\"

However, the fact is that the decision on Chinese tariffs will be based on an anti-dumping investigation into Australia\u2019s exported barley that has been ongoing for almost 18 months.</p> \n   <p><strong>If anything, Australia\u2019s worries over potential tariffs underline the anxiety surrounding deteriorating China-Australia relations. Since China-US relations hit their lowest point in decades amid the Covid-19 crisis, relations between China and Australia have been heading in the same direction. Australian politicians have made no secret of their desire to follow the US, joining in on the China blame game. If China-US ties continue to deteriorate, the uncertainty surrounding China-Australia relations will also increase.<br></strong></p> \n   <p><strong>Such uncertainty will inevitably lead to economic repercussions. In this sense, it now seems necessary to advise Chinese people and companies to watch out for potential risks when it comes to doing business with or studying in Australia.</strong><br></p> \n   <p><strong>Fundamentally speaking, it is not in the interests of people in China and Australia if the latter\u2019s politicians continue to take unfriendly actions and launch political attacks on the former. China-US relations are now in trouble, and if Australia chooses to follow, that would not only negatively impact its relations with China but would also come at the cost of its own economy and trade.</strong><br></p> \n   <p>In fact, the importance of China to Australia\u2019s economy may be far greater than some Australian politicians estimate. China is Australia\u2019s largest export destination, with exports to China accounting for about one third of its total exports. China is the main buyer of Australia\u2019s commodities, farm products and education services.<br></p> \n   <p>There is a need for Australia to reposition its role in regional geopolitics rather than becoming the lapdog of the US. It needs to rethink its relationships with the US and China at this juncture. Given its economic ties with Asian countries are closer than those it has with western nations, it may be more in its interests to focus on how to further integrate into the Asian industrial chain.<br></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-12T23:11:33.123Z\">at 12.11am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebb25548f080c7274539c12\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-12T22:44:58.866Z\">11.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Amid all this, the Eden-Monaro byelection is still to be scheduled.</p> \n  <p>Labor isn\u2019t messing around \u2013 <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> will be out there this morning, with the party\u2019s candidate, <strong>Kristy McBain</strong>, and <strong>Catherine King</strong> for a doorstop at Murrumbateman.</p> \n  <p>But then Labor can do that \u2013 it has a candidate.

The wire was <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/EUR0325442015ENGLISH.PDF\">first installed in 2005</a>, removed two years later and restored by the centre-right government of Mariano Rajoy in 2013. The socialist government led by Pedro Sanchez had a chance to make good on repeated promises of a more humanitarian migration policy after June 2018. And throughout 2018 and 2019, Spanish officials stated their determination to remove the razor wire and, <a href=\"https://elpais.com/politica/2019/12/03/actualidad/1575392092_094935.html\">in the words of</a> the interior minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, move beyond \u201cbloody methods\u201d of border control. <br></p> <p> Spain\u2019s humanitarian policy has become largely redundant, though, given that Moroccan authorities have <a href=\"https://www.abc.es/espana/abci-marruecos-concluye-valla-concertinas-para-dejar-interior-retire-ceuta-201910270229_noticia.html\">started installing razor wire </a> along their own border fence with Ceuta. And Grande-Marlaska <a href=\"https://www.publico.es/videos/840550/grande-marlaska-anuncia-un-incremento-del-30-de-altura-en-las-vallas-de-ceuta-y-melilla\">announced </a>recently that fences around the two Spanish exclaves would be raised by 30 metres to deter incomers.</p> <p>These apparent double standards are part of a pattern, says Karl Kopp, of the German NGO Pro Asyl.</p> <p>\u201cThe European style is to outsource this more vicious, older style of border control with its razor wire and multiple fences to third countries. At home, it\u2019s about drones, surveillance and technical cooperation to identify migrants approaching the EU border before they even reach it. Meanwhile, violent border policing is kept farther afield: out of sight, out of mind. So the Moroccans build an \u2018ugly\u2019 fence which can be criticised, while the Spanish create a more \u2018humanitarian\u2019 alternative,\u201d says Kopp.</p> <p>Public pressure elsewhere has led some governments to reconsider the use of razor wire as experts brand it both inhumane and ineffective. Others even wonder about the legality of its use.<br><br>\u201cOn the one hand, legislation about borders states that crossing anywhere other than an official checkpoint is illegal. On the other hand, the notion of crossing a border illegally is usually voided under international refugee law if making an asylum claim,\u201d says Bernd Kasparek, a researcher at <a href=\"https://bordermonitoring.eu/\">Border Monitoring</a>, a German NGO that tracks pushbacks of refugees. \u201cSo there is a legal tension at the EU\u2019s borders. Sometimes it is very necessary to cross the border irregularly in order to lodge an asylum claim. Fortified borders like these interfere with that legal right, particularly in places where it\u2019s an open secret that 99% of asylum claims lodged with border guards are rejected,\u201d Kasparek adds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9fe8c821729a2a41b0fe609cae35d800d548c2d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9fe8c821729a2a41b0fe609cae35d800d548c2d4/0_0_3840_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dead animal caught in razor wire\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An animal is killed on a fence built to keep out migrants in Slovenia. Balkan wildlife faces an \u201cextinction threat\u201d from razor wire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Martin Lindic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Recent successful attempts at removing razor wire from Europe\u2019s borders have not been motivated by legal or humanitarian concerns but by ecological ones. In Slovenia, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/11/balkan-wildlife-faces-extinction-threat-from-border-fence-to-control-migrants\">environmentalists\u2019 fears</a> of the impact of razor wire on wildlife led in 2016 to the removal of the coils from sections of its border with Croatia. In light of legal constraints in several European states on the deployment of razor wire in rural areas, some manufacturers <a href=\"https://www.gcmetal.pl/en/border-fence-iii/\">even indicate</a> the wildlife-friendly credentials of their razor wire.</p> <p>One difficulty in mounting a challenge is the near impossibility of establishing the true scale of the injuries inflicted specifically by razor wire at borders. According to Kate Dearden, project officer at the I nternational Organization for Migration\u2019s <a href=\"https://missingmigrants.iom.int/\">Missing Migrants Project</a>, many governments only keep records on deaths at borders, rather than deaths that occur later as a result of injuries during attempts to cross them. </p> <p>Moreover, it can be hard to discover exactly which portions of Europe\u2019s fences are topped by razor wire and who supplied it; in recent years many governments have classified detailed information about fences as state security issues. Nevertheless, some manufacturers have refused to sell to border fences on humanitarian grounds. In 2015, Talat Deger, director of the Berlin-based company Mutanox, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/german-companies-refuse-to-sell-razor-wire-for-hungarys-anti-refugee-fence-a6668296.html\">refused</a> to do a deal with the Hungarian government. In an interview last year, Deger\u2019s successor, Efekan Dikici, said that he and his staff have kept to the principle.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to sell razor wire, of course, but only for the right purposes: to secure property, factories, jails, or for example on the railings of ships to prevent piracy. For those purposes it\u2019s justified; but when it\u2019s being used against humans who need help, that\u2019s awkward,\u201d said Dikici. \u201cMost of our workers have a foreign background themselves, so I think we all feel this a bit more.\u201d <br>That stance is costly. Dikici stressed that it can be genuinely difficult for razor wire suppliers to establish the end use of their product, given that they often deal with middlemen and procurement agencies. \u201cIf you\u2019re selling to a government, razor wire could be used for a prison or a border. But if a request for a really huge amount comes in, we do wonder whether it\u2019s for a border fence. Even large private properties need a few hundred metres, not kilometres. I ask myself, if we got a request from the US for the Mexico border, would we give them a quote?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7064d3d46084260980e23cc9945a1d96431443db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7064d3d46084260980e23cc9945a1d96431443db/0_0_3100_2123/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Syrian migrants clamber under a razor-wire fence\" width=\"1000\" height=\"685\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Syrian migrants clamber under a razor-wire fence into Hungary at the border with Serbia, near Roszke, August 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bernadett Szabo/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other companies do not appear to have these scruples \u2013 after all, there is a brisk trade to be done in razor wire, which is not to be confused with barbed wire. Razor wire is cut from single sheets of galvanised steel, and most commonly sold in folding coils known in the industry as concertinas. The sharp razors come in various sizes; most seen by the Guardian at four European border fences are of the BTO-22, BTO-20 and BTO-10 varieties \u2013 straight razor edges affixed to a metal coil.</p> <p>There are even more formidable options: CBT-60 includes \u201charpoon\u201d style hooked razor heads that can embed themselves in the flesh of those trying to cross them. Some razor wire manufacturers seemingly flaunt the effects in their brochures; for example, Chinese manufacturer Hebei Jinshi <a href=\"https://www.razorbarbedwirefence.com/pdf/concertina-razor-wire-brochure.pdf\">advertises</a> its CBT-65 long blade as a \u201cvicious product\u201d whose \u201cextra long blade razors produce[s] [a] frightening effect.\u201d</p> <p>However, some European producers have discovered that selling razor wire to border fences comes at the cost of bad press, even in times of rising xenophobic sentiment.<br><br>When Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, decreed in 2015 that a fence be raised on Hungary\u2019s border with Serbia, the Malaga-based manufacturer <a href=\"http://concertina.es/en/\">European Security Fencing</a> (ESF) provided the razor wire. ESF, a subdivision of Mora Salazar, has delivered coils for fences in Austria, Slovenia, Bulgaria and France, and proudly presents itself as one of Europe\u2019s leading razor wire suppliers.</p> <p>Nevertheless, after the installation of its razor wire on the Hungarian border, ESF spokesmen told the Spanish press that they had been unaware of the product\u2019s final use by the Hungarian clients. In September 2015, the company <a href=\"https://www.eldiario.es/desalambre/concertinas-valla-Hungria-refugiados-Spain_0_431507330.html\">deleted its official Twitter account</a> following the backlash provoked by a tweet boasting of ESF\u2019s leading role in the European razor wire industry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"83cf9636445169459ca1f0e15bb0a8f7700c7b08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83cf9636445169459ca1f0e15bb0a8f7700c7b08/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alain Diabanza\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alain Diabanza, a former refugee from the Democratic Republic of the Congo who now teaches in Spain, at the razor-wire fence in Ceuta, Spain\u2019s north African territory.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Juan Medina/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Today, ESF appears to have competition in the form of Polish company GC Metal, which now refers to itself as Europe\u2019s leading seller of razor wire. The company\u2019s website <a href=\"https://www.gcmetal.pl/en/securing-the-border/\">indicates</a> that it may have been involved in supplying concertina wire for the Bulgarian-Turkish border fence. Neither ESF nor GC Metal responded to requests for comment about the end use of their products or their humanitarian implications. <br><br>Europe\u2019s fortified borders are here to stay, even if borders in decades to come may be unrecognisable in comparison to today\u2019s crude fences. Razor wire, much like fortified borders in general, is both inhumane and ineffective, concludes Kopp, though its removal may not necessarily be a bellwether for a more humanitarian migration policy. Seismic sensors, night vision cameras and <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/05/11/drones-artificial-intelligence-europe-roborder/\">surveillance drones</a> have all come to play a greater role in border policing \u2013 with hi-tech solutions like these, will razor wire become redundant?</p> <p><br>\u201cThere\u2019s a high symbolic value to razor wire, like fences,\u201d says Mark Akkerman, a researcher at the Transnational Institute and author of a <a href=\"https://www.tni.org/files/publication-downloads/business_of_building_walls_-_full_report.pdf\">recent report</a> on Europe\u2019s border-industrial complex. \u201cSimply put, they allow governments to show the public, the press, their voters, and the world that they\u2019re \u2018doing something\u2019 about migration.\u201d</p> <p><br>\u2022 Maxim Edwards is a Berlin-based editor at GlobalVoices</p>",

This starting premise suggests a campus \u201cautofiction\u201d in the vein of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/08/the-topeka-school-by-ben-lerner-review\">Ben Lerner</a>, but things take a rather different turn when Juan Pablo\u2019s wheeler-dealer cousin embroils him in a criminal conspiracy involving some very bad dudes. They compel him to infiltrate a milieu of literary postgrads, with instructions to \u201clearn all the gender studies chitchat\u201d and seduce a student called Laia, the daughter of a wealthy Catalan magnate from whom they hope to extort money.</p> <p>It just so happens that Juan Pablo\u2019s thesis is on humour in Latin American literature, and his surreal sojourn in the criminal underworld affords him a perfect opportunity for fieldwork: the gangsters\u2019 dialogue, expletive-ridden and almost cartoonishly aggressive, abounds with casually misogynistic and xenophobic banter. The patter is lively and the language intentionally idiosyncratic: in his fascinating afterword, translator Daniel Hahn explains how he adapted the novel\u2019s variety of Hispanic vernaculars \u2013 encompassing Argentinian, Catalan and Mexican Spanish \u2013 into a series of distinct English registers.</p> <p><em>I Don\u2019t Expect Anyone to Believe Me </em>is an eccentric hybrid, combining pulpy crime fiction \u2013 there are basement murders, double-crossings, blacked-out cars \u2013 with avant-garde archness. Around 200 pages in, a tough warns Juan Pablo: \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten this far by sheer fucking fluke, buddy, but you must be on like page two hundred by now and this book has two-fifty at the absolute most.\u201d Literary life comes in for plenty of stick: Laia\u2019s father bonds with one of the gangsters over their shared contempt for \u201cliterature people [who] believe in feelings\u201d. Perhaps the real divide isn\u2019t between law abiders and criminals, but between men of action and the feckless dreamers who populate Juan Pablo\u2019s favourite novels. The self-doubt of bookish souls is well trodden ground, but Villalobos\u2019s take on it is refreshingly exuberant.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>I Don\u2019t Expect Anyone to Believe Me by Juan Pablo Villalobos, translated by Daniel Hahn, is published by And Other Stories (RRP \u00a311.99).</em></p>",
  "<p>Last week, the Office for National Statistics confirmed what many had suspected since the start of this pandemic \u2013 black, Asian and minority ethnic people are far more likely to get and die from coronavirus. But it is the scale of difference that is so worrying.

It can\u2019t come soon enough: among frontline NHS and social care workers, the difference is all too stark: despite accounting for just <a href=\"https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/workforce-and-business/workforce-diversity/nhs-workforce/latest\">20%</a> of the workforce, rising to 44% among medics, <a href=\"https://www.hsj.co.uk/exclusive-deaths-of-nhs-staff-from-covid-19-analysed/7027471.article\">94% of doctors and </a><a href=\"https://www.hsj.co.uk/exclusive-deaths-of-nhs-staff-from-covid-19-analysed/7027471.article\">71% of nurses</a> who have died from Covid-19 were black, Asian and minority ethnic.

Health workers caught flu during both the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/nurses-fell-like-ninepins-death-and-bravery-in-the-1918-flu-pandemic\">1918</a> and <a href=\"https://bjgp.org/content/59/565/622\">1957</a> and 1968 flu pandemics. And while an ethnic breakdown of the data is not available, some of the casualties of the 1957 and 1968 epidemics will have been black, Asian or from ethnic minorities. It is even possible some BAME nurses working in the UK died in the 1918 epidemic. We just don\u2019t know. But nurses from BAME backgrounds have been working in the NHS for generations. Although many were part of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2018/apr/17/who-are-the-windrush-generation-video-explainer\">Windrush generation</a>, coming from the Caribbean to the UK from 1948 to 1971 to work in the newly established NHS, they were not the first arrivals.<br><br>By 1954, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Many-rivers-cross-Caribbean-1948-69/dp/0113227213\">more than 3,000 Caribbean women</a> were training in British hospitals. By 1959, official statistics showed 6,365 nursing students in Britain who had come here from overseas. By 1966-67 the total number of nurses and midwives from overseas who trained here had risen to 16,745. </p> <p>Research (<a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/historysocialaction/esther-bruce\">Aunt Esther</a>)<strong> </strong>by social historian Stephen Bourne has revealed that black nurses worked in the healthcare system long before the NHS was even thought of. Most would have been from within the British empire, including the Caribbean, India and countries in Africa.</p> <p> Bourne believes that their experiences were far less negative than current thinking might have us believe. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t stereotype black nurses\u2019 experiences, nor victimise the nurses who came as part of the Windrush generation,\u201d says Bourne. </p> <p>\u201cWe know that black nurses from Britain\u2019s former colonies, including the Windrush generation, began to arrive in Britain soon after the founding of the NHS. However, the back story of the nurses who came here before 1948 is not known.</p> <p>\u201cAs far as I am aware, none left any testimonies, so we do not know their point of view. They would have confronted some racist attitudes, but they would also have been loved and respected by their contemporaries in the medical profession, and their patients.\u201d</p> <p> Most will have at least heard of the Jamaican nurse <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Seacole\">Mary Seacole</a>, a contemporary of Florence Nightingale, who also nursed troops in the Crimean war. Other, less well-known black nurses include <a href=\"https://eastendwomensmuseum.org/blog/annie-brewster-the-london-hospitals-nurse-ophthalmic\">Annie Brewster</a> , a nurse originally from St Vincent , who moved to London as a child in the 1860s, worked at the London hospital in Whitechapel from 1881 for 20 years and died in 1902, aged 42.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f3d573781ac5aca46b9b1f067e3b7f5a8f1e0496\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3d573781ac5aca46b9b1f067e3b7f5a8f1e0496/0_0_755_1184/638.jpg\" alt=\"Annie Brewster, who came from St Vincent to London in the 1860s and worked at the London hospital in Whitechapel\" width=\"638\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Annie Brewster, who came from St Vincent to London in the 1860s and worked at the London hospital in Whitechapel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: None</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brewster worked with elderly patients who were losing their sight. \u201cBrewster was much loved,\u201d says Bourne. </p> <p>Fast forward to the early 1930s, when <a href=\"https://www.rcn.org.uk/library-exhibitions/wake-up-slackers\">Eva Lowe </a><strong> </strong>came to the UK from Jamaica looking for work. She eventually trained at St Nicholas\u2019 hospital in Plumstead, south London, from 1932, registering with the Royal College of Nursing as a qualified nurse in 1935.</p> <p>But it was a difficult time for any black nurse to gain employment in the pre-NHS healthcare system. Before working at St Nicholas, Lowe had applied to 28 hospitals. All rejected her.</p> <p>One hospital said they had to consider the feelings of the patients; another that she would have difficulty being accepted by other nurses, some of whom were daughters of army officers.</p> <p>According to the Royal College of Nursing, there are many other stories, as yet untold, of women who trained here and were admitted to the nursing register before the 1930s. No one knows who they were, as the nurse\u2019s ethnicity was not recorded on the register. However, it is known that hospitals in London and Birmingham admitted black nurses for training before that time.</p> <p>Today, <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/nursingmidwifery/delivering-the-nhs-ltp/cno-black-and-minority-%20%20ethnic-bme-leadership/\">one in every five nurses and midwives are from BAME backgrounds</a>, rising to much higher levels (up to 40%) in some regions and parts of the country, such as London.</p> <p>\u201cBlack nurses in Britain entering the profession today have more role models than I did,\u201d says Dame Donna Kinnair, chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, who trained in the 1980s. \u201cThere are far more visible black leaders in health and social care now. But even now, there aren\u2019t nearly enough.</p> <p>\u201cIf the stories of these nurses who made great strides in the early days of modern nursing had been more well known, it may have brought comfort to black nurses who faced prejudice and discrimination, and maybe even stopped some leaving the profession altogether.\u201d</p> <p>Some black women who nursed in the UK before the NHS started had more positive experiences. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Tsehai\">Princess Tsehai</a>, the daughter of the exiled Ethiopian king Haile Selassie, trained at Great Ormond Street hospital in London, qualifying as a nurse in 1939, before returning home in 1941 to work there.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a real surprise to find out about her,\u201d says Karen Bonner, a senior nurse and trustee of the Mary Seacole Trust. \u201cThe idea of her training here but going back to her own country, I found really impressive.\u201d</p> <p>Princess Tsehai died in childbirth in 1942, a year after returning home, so never had the chance to pass on her knowledge. But in 1946 Selassie set up a hospital and nursing school in Addis Ababa in her name.</p> <p>In 1938, another African royal, <a href=\"https://www.thehistorypress.co.uk/articles/10-things-you-didn-t-know-about-britain-s-black-community-during-the-world-wars/\">Princess Ademola</a>, daughter of the chief of northern Nigeria, trained at Guy\u2019s hospital, becoming a state registered nurse (SRN). \u201cEveryone was very kind to me,\u201d she told newspaper journalists at the time.

But this creates a sense of belonging. It shows that the presence of BAME people isn\u2019t new, but that it is woven into the texture of this country.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a story here that needs to be told,\u201d adds Irwin. \u201cThese nurses were not exotic \u2013 they were already here.\u201d</p>",
  "<h2>Top story: Virus not going to disappear, Fauci warns</h2> \n<p>Hello and good morning from me, Warren Murray. Hopefully you are settled into a comfortable position \u2013 or a comfortable stride. Here is the news to start your Wednesday.</p> \n<p>Eight million people with underlying health conditions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/millions-with-health-conditions-at-risk-from-covid-19-if-forced-back-to-work\">should be exempted</a> from plans to get Britain back to work and normal life, according to scientists who warn that easing lockdown too quickly could propel the Covid-19 death toll to 73,000 this year. Union leaders have voiced concerns over Boris Johnson\u2019s exhortations to people to return to work from today if their jobs can\u2019t be done from home. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/stay-alert-or-stay-home-how-covid-19-lockdown-rules-differ-across-uk\">Whether to \u201cstay alert\u201d or \u201cstay home\u201d</a> is a different story from today depending on where you live in the UK, with devolved administrations diverging from the central government\u2019s plans for lifting the lockdown.</p> \n<p>As many as 6,000 children around the world could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/13/unicef-6000-children-could-die-every-day-due-to-impact-of-coronavirus\">die every day from preventable causes</a> over the next six months due to the impact of coronavirus on routine health services, such as family planning, childbirth, postnatal care and vaccination, Unicef has warned. This is in addition to the 2.5 million children who die globally every six months before their fifth birthday, and threatens to reverse nearly a decade of progress on ending preventable child deaths.</p> \n<p>Brazil and Mexico have both seen deaths from Covid-19 spike sharply on their deadliest days yet. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/global-report-brazil-and-mexico-record-deadliest-day-from-covid-19\">US remains by far the worst-affected country</a> and now has almost one-third of the world\u2019s 4.26m cases, and a national death tally of 82,339.

Almost 4 million women born in the 1950s lost their pensions when the pension age was raised from 60 to 66 between 2010 and 2018.

  "<h2><strong>The Deuce</strong></h2> <p>David Simon\u2019s consistently flawless drama bowed out this year with a third and final season that added Aids, gentrification, abuse and much more to its nuanced portrait of the sex industry. Absorbing, humanising and heartbreaking. </p> <p><strong>What we said:</strong> \u201cThe show\u2019s scorn for churned-out, cheap entertainment for the masses is palpable. This is rich television that demands you give it your full attention.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/02/the-deuce-final-season-review-the-porn-epic-everyone-should-be-watching\">Read more</a>.</p> <h2><strong>The Nest</strong></h2> <p>This Glasgow-set drama rose above the surfeit of primetime thrillers with its shocking central premise of a middle-class couple recruiting a troubled 18-year-old surrogate. With three complex leads \u2013 played by Line of Duty\u2019s Martin Compston, Peaky Blinders\u2019 Sophie Rundle and newcomer Mirren Mack \u2013 this was easily the BBC\u2019s best thriller since Doctor Foster.</p> <p><strong>What we said:</strong> \u201cAs the series has progressed, it has become increasingly obvious that this is not so much a thriller about surrogacy as it is a fierce commentary on aspiration, class and success \u2013 on who gets to have ambitions in life and who doesn\u2019t.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/13/mums-net-how-surrogacy-thriller-the-nest-got-us-hooked\">Read more</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"01d36603e9e00f3c6e6c0604a00248a7ed34ba4d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01d36603e9e00f3c6e6c0604a00248a7ed34ba4d/0_0_4285_2572/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Nest, with Mirren Mack and Liz Ewing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Nest, with Mirren Mack and Liz Ewing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Mainz/BBC/Studio Lambert</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Tiger King</strong></h2> <p>The quarantine hit that launched a thousand memes. Tiger King introduced us to the eminently sketchy, infinitely bingeable world of Joe Exotic \u2013 zoo proprietor, country singer and possible murderer \u2013 and his arch nemesis, Carole Baskin, a self-styled conservationist with some very interesting views on animal welfare. </p> <p><strong>What we said: </strong>\u201cIn Tiger King, reality is stranger than fiction and the characters larger than life \u2013 their morality and culpability in Joe Exotic\u2019s fall is up to viewer discretion.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/20/tiger-king-joe-exotic-netflix-series\">Read more</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Save Me Too</strong></h2> <p>Created by and starring Lennie James, and with Stephen Graham, Lesley Manville and Suranne Jones among its cast, the second series of Sky\u2019s thriller ratcheted the intrigue up to 11 as it threw viewers back into the underbelly of south-east London, where traffickers, gangsters and peril bubble just below the surface.</p> <p><strong>What we said: </strong>\u201cIt has far more emotional depth than most of its rivals \u2026 and stands firm as a gripping thriller. It starts with the kind of bang that insists you pay attention to find out how we got here: in this case, to Nelly, sitting in a car, examining his bloody fists.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/01/save-me-too-review-a-gripping-thriller-with-emotional-heft\">Read more</a>.</p> <h2><strong>This Country</strong></h2> <p>This is arguably the best mockumentary since The Office, and the misadventures of bumpkin cousins Kerry and Kurtan (real-life siblings Daisy-May and Charlie Cooper) were both absurd and loving.

But they are doing so in order for it not to be forgotten.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/28/belsen-our-story-review-the-nazi-horrors-that-must-never-be-forgotten\">Read more</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Dracula</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s no easy feat to reboot a story told a thousand times over, let alone twice. But the writers of Sherlock \u2013 Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss \u2013 did just that when they took on Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula, and to fabulous effect. Gender flips, time shifts and a brilliantly sexy yet vicious central performance by Claes Bang made this a New Year\u2019s delight.</p> <p><strong>What we said:</strong> \u201cIt\u2019s a bloodstained love letter to a classic, beautifully and delicately scented with the faintest hint of ham that gothic yarns need; a homage to all the great counts who have gone before, but still entirely its own thing.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/01/dracula-review-bbc1-steven-moffat-mark-gatiss\">Read more</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Cheer</strong></h2> <p>Who\u2019d have thought 2020 would be the year everyone got into cheerleading? The peculiar mix of gymnastics, dance and heartbreaking back stories captivated, as coach Monica Aldama put her young charges through their paces \u2013 with scant regard for their physical wellbeing. The sight of teenage girls flipping and falling on their faces is sometimes painful to watch, but it\u2019s impossible to look away.</p> <p><strong>What we said:</strong> \u201cLook what the human body is capable of\u201d you will start to think, as 40 students made entirely of muscle and sinew bend, flip, form pyramids, toss and catch each other midair \u2013 and generally disapply all known laws of physics.

It\u2019s beautifully drawn, both painful and touching, but above all it\u2019s funny. And Lisa Kudrow as Mae\u2019s overbearing mother is a joy. </p> <p><strong>What we said:</strong> \u201cFeel Good should make you feel good. It\u2019s not only an immaculately written and paced piece of work and a properly funny comedy, it has also created a delicately and intricately constructed, deeply humane world.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/18/feel-good-review-mae-martin-canadian-standup-charlotte-ritchie-series\">Read more</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8220c30e19eecf4de718d01036e1588ada3bce9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8220c30e19eecf4de718d01036e1588ada3bce9c/0_100_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Inside No 9.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Hairpin narrative turns\u2019 \u2026 Inside No 9.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophie Mutevelian/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Inside No 9</strong></h2> <p>Keeping any show fresh after five series is tough, even more so when each episode features a new set of characters, in a different world, usually with a devilish sting in the tail. But Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith are up to the challenge \u2013 and this year\u2019s outings were some of the best, from the classically mind-bending dissection of the magician\u2019s craft that was Misdirection to the surprisingly touching kitchen sink drama of Love\u2019s Great Adventure \u2013 Inside No 9 did not disappoint. And that\u2019s without even mentioning the return of some old favourites from Psychoville, their previous hit series. We\u2019ll never listen to Soulja Boy the same again. </p> <p><strong>What we said:</strong> \u201cThe show\u2019s ability to surprise goes well beyond hairpin narrative turns. Inside No 9 practises a kind of genre fusion that is still rare in TV.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/03/shock-horrors-how-inside-no-9-makes-the-mundane-unmissable\">Read more</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Quiz</strong></h2> <p>Michael Sheen\u2019s uncanny rendition of Chris Tarrant might have captured the headlines, but it was Matthew Macfadyen who stole the show \u2013 based on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/nov/12/quiz-review-exploration-of-the-thin-line-between-courtroom-and-showbusiness\">the play by James Graham</a> \u2013 with his quietly brilliant performance as Major Charles Ingram. This ITV mini-series, which recreated the Who Wants to be a Millionaire? scandal of 2001, landed at the perfect time for a nation coming to terms with a pandemic, and left many of us questioning what we thought we knew and the justice of that conviction from all those years ago.</p> <p><strong>What we said:</strong> \u201cOnce the nuts and bolts are dealt with and the focus shifts to the Ingrams and life among normal humans outside the TV studios, the drama becomes as addictive as Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? proved.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/13/quiz-review-who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-charles-ingram-diana-drama\">Read more</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Love Is Blind</strong></h2> <p>Just when you thought Flirty Dancing was as weird as reality TV dating could get, Netflix popped up in the wings to say \u201chold my glass\u201d. The bizarre sight of singletons talking to a wall before professing their undying love to each other (sight unseen) was hard to look away from, and matched by what happened next. It\u2019s difficult to forget watching Jessica feed wine to her dog, or the look on Giannina\u2019s face at the altar.</p> <p><strong>What we said:</strong> \u201cYou will be bleary-eyed and shattered from all the shouting you have done, the emotional investment you have made, the WhatsApp messages you have typed to a specially formed group and the heartfelt contributions you have made to various internet forums on the subject.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/13/love-is-blind-review-toxic-revolting-and-totally-addictive\">Read more</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59fefa67f3d66b03cb35e5d6e2f64857f32073d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59fefa67f3d66b03cb35e5d6e2f64857f32073d9/0_0_4545_2692/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Race Across the World contestants Emon and Jamiul at Chapultepec Park, Mexico City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"592\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Race Across the World contestants Emon and Jamiul at Chapultepec Park, Mexico City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Wiseman/BBC/Studio Lambert</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Race Across the World</strong></h2> <p>The first series of this travelogue turned reality contest was a delight, and the second couldn\u2019t have come at a better time. With the chance to travel to South America never having seemed further away, the vicarious thrill of watching the duos explore everywhere from Chapultepec castle in Mexico City to the southernmost city in the world, Ushuaia in Argentina, is exhilarating. But what really made it such a joy was the human interactions, from the bickering of siblings Dom and Lizzie as they rediscover their friendship to the wonderfully tender mother/son relationship of Jo and Sam. Roll on series three.</p> <p><strong>What we said:</strong> \u201cRace Across the World is an astounding piece of TV because it captures all the vibrant highs and exhausted lows of travel in all of their raw glory: the flooded hotels, the 18-hour coach trips, the moments of giving up, the bafflingly undesirable toilets, communicating in a nonsensical language halfway between English and Spanish; but also the late-night beers, the dancing with strangers, the helpful locals hand-drawing a map on the back of a notepad, the ecstatic feeling of a comfortable bed.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/21/race-across-the-world\">Read more</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Little America</strong></h2> <p>This anthology series was a sensitive take on immigration in modern America, all based on essays penned for Epic magazine. It was also a hopeful glimpse at what Apple could achieve with its new streaming platform. With stories ranging from an Indian boy having to manage his parents\u2019 motel after they are deported to a Nigerian cowboy tackling racism in the 1980s US, Little America was a poignant reminder of the continuing need for diversity and inclusion in the country and on our screens. </p> <p><strong>What we said:</strong><em> </em>\u201cA set of small, intimate endeavours that feature no star names and that privilege storytelling above all else.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/17/little-america-review-eight-immigrant-stories-make-for-truly-radical-tv\">Read more</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Bojack Horseman</strong></h2> <p>No one would have guessed that a cartoon about a washed-up talking horse would become one of the most incisively satirical and emotionally brutal pieces of TV to have been produced in the last decade. Yet Bojack Horseman\u2019s creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg delivered on the gut punches, cathartic laughs, and perhaps even a glimmer of hope for its menagerie of characters in tinseltown for its sixth and final season. </p> <p><strong>What we said:</strong><em> </em>\u201cLike The Simpsons or Daria, two of creator Bob-Waksberg\u2019s touchstones, BoJack Horseman can be touching and profound without relinquishing the funny.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/31/bojack-horseman-review\">Read more</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"84dd40a4b177c134f055219326f426176529b948\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84dd40a4b177c134f055219326f426176529b948/0_143_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daisy Edgar-Jones and Paul Mescal in Normal People.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daisy Edgar-Jones and Paul Mescal in Normal People.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Enda Bowe/BBC/Element Pictures/Hulu</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Normal People</strong></h2> <p>Self-indulgent millennial romp or nuanced exposition of young love and its attendant traumas? Whatever your take on Sally Rooney\u2019s bestselling novel, its small-screen adaptation was a beautiful thing to behold with the on-and-off-again relationship of Marianne and Connell played with nuance and depth by Daisy Edgar-Jones and Paul Mescal. Producing record-breaking streaming figures for the BBC, the show struck a tender note with viewers during lockdown. </p> <p><strong>What we said:</strong><em> </em>\u201cIt leaves you either wanting more, or relieved that you are not being asked to relive the exquisite agony of first love for any longer.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/26/normal-people-review-sally-rooney-bbc-hulu\">Read the full review</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Frankie Boyle\u2019s Tour of Scotland</strong></h2> <p>Arch-cynic Frankie Boyle set out on a four-part tour of his home country, trialling new standup routines in clubs from Aberdeen to Glasgow and engaging in local delights along the way. Among the hilarity was Boyle in a treehouse caravan with a hermit, a visit to a commune and a historical re-enactment, all underpinned by a poignant examination of his Scottish identity.</p> <p><strong>What we said: </strong>\u201cIf, as he says, there comes a time in every comedian\u2019s career when he turns to travelogues, we can be glad he has arrived at his.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/07/frankie-boyles-tour-of-scotland-review-bbc2\">Read more</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e268d1df97fbc5e110450bf4563e101e7b63679\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e268d1df97fbc5e110450bf4563e101e7b63679/13_140_1602_961/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Unorthodox.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A love letter to independence\u2019 \u2026 Unorthodox.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Unorthodox</strong></h2> <p>Exquisitely detailed and shot mostly in Berlin, this four-part drama based on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/aug/29/deborah-feldman-hasidic-once-upon-a-life\">the memoirs of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/aug/29/deborah-feldman-hasidic-once-upon-a-life\">Deborah Feldman</a> is a tale of escape from rigid conservatism. It has a breakout performance by 24-year-old Shira Haas as Esty, a 19-year-old Hasidic Jew running from her claustrophobic Brooklyn community, and is an engrossing coming-of-age tale, thriller and love letter to independence.</p> <p><strong>What we said:</strong><em> </em>\u201cAnyone who feels a need to struggle for individuality against their community, they\u2019ll find some of themselves in the show.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/26/unorthodox-behind-the-deutschland-83-co-creators-new-netflix-series\">Read more</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Better Call Saul</strong></h2> <p>Bob Odenkirk\u2019s dodgy lawyer Saul Goodman was a passing highlight of Breaking Bad, but in this prequel he had enough riveting backstory to merit five seasons of drama.

Packed with boxy suits, slow-mo slam dunks and the high-stakes politics of the NBA, the series was a glimpse into the psyche of one of the greatest sportsmen of all time and the context that made and almost broke him.</p> <p><strong>What we said: </strong>\u201cOnce you understand the singularity of Jordan\u2019s focus, everything else about him makes sense.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/19/michael-jordan-documentary-espn-the-last-dance-nba\">Read more</a>.</p>",

He would not \u201csugar coat\u201d the resulting blowout in the national deficit, he said, and also cautioned that the treasury forecasts for the economy released on budget day would paint a \u201cchallenging\u201d path to recovery.</p> <p>Previous models by officials have predicted unemployment rates of between 8.5% and 26% following the pandemic and strict lockdown.</p> <p>Analysts said the wellbeing approach would now come under pressure in an economy where more people were vulnerable due to the coronavirus than a year ago.</p> <p>\u201cLots of other countries were crying out for an economic approach that centred on something more than growth,\u201d said Max Harris, a New Zealand political commentator. \u201cBut understandably that focus meant there were expectations raised in New Zealand for an improvement in wellbeing across the board.\u201d</p> <p>The government must now deliver results for those who for years \u201chave been left out by budgets of a more ordinary kind,\u201d he said. \u201cIf their concerns were addressed, that would give people confidence that wellbeing is more than just a frame.\u201d</p> <p>But economists said Robertson could not afford to look too far into the distance, and the budget\u2019s success in improving wellbeing would depend on his short-term spending.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the greatest contributors to a lack of wellbeing is unemployment,\u201d said Arthur Grimes, a professor at Victoria University, Wellington and a former chairman of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the few things that people don\u2019t recover from.\u201d</p> <p>New Zealand\u2019s strict lockdown has restricted deaths to only 21 but the government\u2019s detractors say the strident measures have come at too high a cost to business.</p> <p>\u201cWe may have flattened the curve as a nation but with 1,000 people a day joining the dole queue and employers deciding whether they battle on or give up, it is clear lockdown has gone on too long,\u201d the opposition leader, Simon Bridges of the National party, said.</p> <p>He has also warned of the effects of the lockdown on mental health and Max Harris said he hoped the budget would focus on more than creating work.</p> <p>\u201cThis could be a generation-defining moment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was great that Grant was talking about dignity in work and a decent life for those in work, but I think the key to this budget will also be, will it provide dignity for those who are not in work, since we\u2019re going to have an increase of people not in work.\u201d</p> <p>Robertson told the Guardian that while the political world he had to operate in had not changed \u2013 his party has two coalition partners to please when seeking approval for its measures \u2013 some things were different.</p> <p>\u201cI do take seriously the fact that that opportunity\u2019s there,\u201d he said. \u201cNot every country has that privilege, because they\u2019re still in a situation where they are getting on top of the virus.
