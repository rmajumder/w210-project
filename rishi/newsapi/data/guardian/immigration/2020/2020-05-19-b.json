Malpass said his bank had so far loaned money to about 100 countries, accounting for 70% of the world\u2019s population.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>The World Health Organization\u2019s annual assembly passed a resolution on the need to investigate the global response to the pandemic</strong>. None of the WHO\u2019s 194 member states raised objections to the resolution brought by the EU on behalf of more than 100 countries.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UK reported 545 more deaths, taking its total to 35,341</strong>. The environment secretary, George Eustice, announced the latest figure at the government\u2019s daily briefing on the epidemic. The UK remains the world\u2019s second-worst affected country by deaths after the US.</li> \n   <li><strong>Rishi Sunak, the UK\u2019s chancellor, said the country is facing \u201ca severe recession the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen\u201d</strong>. Giving evidence to the Lords economic affairs committee, he said he expects the unemployment rate to be in double figures by the end of the year.</li> \n   <li><strong>Cambridge University will not hold traditional lectures in the 2020/21 academic year.</strong>There will be no \u201cface-to-face lectures\u201d at the University of Cambridge in the 2020/21 academic year, the institution has said.

The health ministry confirmed 581 new cases out of 1,200 tests, marking the country\u2019s worst day of the crisis \u2013 the previous high was 414.</li> \n   <li><strong>The border between Canada and the US will remain closed</strong> to non-essential travel until 21 June.

The latest figures from the health ministry showed the majority of the latest deaths were in some of the hardest-hit areas of the country.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Al-Aqsa mosque, Islam\u2019s third holiest site, will reopen next week</strong>, authorities said. The Islamic endowment overseeing the site in Jerusalem under Jordanian custodianship had taken the unprecedented step of closing it to worshippers in March.</li> \n   <li><strong>People living within a kilometre of Barcelona\u2019s beaches will be able to return to the sand from Wednesday</strong>, as the local lockdown eases.

It has been licensed for use in the US since the mid 1950s and is listed by the World Health Organization as an \u201cessential\u201d medicine.</p> \n  <h2><strong>What\u2019s the state of the current evidence?</strong><br></h2> \n  <p>In May, the British Medical Journal reported on a randomised (although still problematic) clinical trial in China that found little evidence hydroxychloroquine worked, with serious adverse events noted in two patients.</p> \n  <p>A second study reported in the BMJ last week on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/vital-drug-people-lupus-coronavirus-covid-19-link-hydroxychloroquine\">French trial</a> also concluded that hydroxychloroquine does not significantly reduce admission to intensive care or improve survival rates in patients hospitalised with pneumonia owing to Covid-19. Overall, 89% of those who received hydroxychloroquine survived after 21 days, compared with 91% in the control group.</p> \n  <p>The US Food and Drug Administration in a safety alert issued on 24 April warned that it had received reports that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine could have serious side-effects and that the drugs should be taken only under the close supervision of a doctor in a hospital setting or a clinical trial.</p> \n  <h2>What are the risks in taking hydroxychloroquine?</h2> \n  <p>There are several side-effects. The most serious is that it can interfere with the rhythm of the heart. Other side-effects include headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, skin rash or itching or hair loss. Research published by the Mayo Clinic has suggested that \u201coff-label\u201d repurposing of drugs such as hydroxychloroquine could lead to \u201cdrug-induced sudden cardiac death\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Although Trump\u2019s official physician has said he was in \u201cvery good health\u201d at his last official checkup, the president is 73 and his recorded weight would put him in a BMI category of \u201cclinically obese\u201d.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec443a08f0886ce4f5d6a4c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-19T20:49:28.592Z\">9.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In the US, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> has claimed that scientists carried out a study of the effects of hydroxychloroquine, the results of which suggested he is wrong to tout it, because they oppose him politically.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20065920v2\">The study</a> of hundreds of patients at US veterans health administration medical centers showed that those who took hydroxychloroquine had a 27.8% death rate, while those who did not had an 11.4% death rate.

Malpass said his bank had so far loaned money to about 100 countries, accounting for 70% of the world\u2019s population. </li> \n   <li><strong>The World Health Organization\u2019s annual assembly passed a resolution on the need to investigate the global response to the pandemic</strong>. None of the WHO\u2019s 194 member states raised objections to the resolution brought by the EU on behalf of more than 100 countries.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UK reported 545 more deaths, taking its total to 35,341</strong>. The environment secretary, George Eustice, announced the latest figure at the government\u2019s daily briefing on the epidemic. The UK remains the world\u2019s second-worst affected country by deaths after the US.</li> \n   <li><strong>Rishi Sunak, the UK\u2019s chancellor, said the country is facing \u201ca severe recession the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen\u201d</strong>. Giving evidence to the Lords economic affairs committee, he said he expects the unemployment rate to be in double figures by the end of the year.</li> \n   <li><strong>Afghanistan recorded its biggest one-day rise in infections </strong>as about half of tests done in a 24-hour period came back positive. The health ministry confirmed 581 new cases out of 1,200 tests, marking the country\u2019s worst day of the crisis \u2013 the previous high was 414.</li> \n   <li><strong>The border between Canada and the US will remain closed</strong> to non-essential travel until 21 June. The closure was set to expire this week after the two governments announced a 30-day extension of the restrictions last month.</li> \n   <li><strong>Spain reported a death toll below 100 for the third consecutive day</strong>, confirming 83 deaths from coronavirus in the past 24 hours. The latest figures from the health ministry showed the majority of the latest deaths were in some of the hardest-hit areas of the country.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Al-Aqsa mosque, Islam\u2019s third holiest site, will reopen next week</strong>, authorities said. The Islamic endowment overseeing the site in Jerusalem under Jordanian custodianship had taken the unprecedented step of closing it to worshippers in March.</li> \n   <li><strong>People living within a kilometre of Barcelona\u2019s beaches will be able to return to the sand from Wednesday</strong>, as the local lockdown eases. People will be able to make \u201crecreational use\u201d of the Catalan capital\u2019s beaches as long as they respect physical distancing. </li> \n   <li><strong>Half a dozen people from three English Premier League football clubs tested positive for Covid-19</strong> in the space of two days, dealing a blow to hopes of top-flight English football resuming next month.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s it from me, <strong>Damien Gayle</strong>, until tomorrow. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec41d808f0864e579f13f24\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/dan-collyns\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-19T18:00:42.966Z\">7.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Covid-19 continues to sweep across the <strong>Peruvian Amazon</strong> with deadly ferocity. Pucallpa, on the country\u2019s eastern border with Brazil, follows <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/07/peru-jungle-iquitos-coronavirus-covid-19\">Iquitos</a> as the second Peruvian Amazon city to be ravaged by the deadly virus, writes <strong>Dan Collyns</strong>.</p> \n  <p>Social media images showed sick people lying in motorised rickshaws outside one hospital which had shut its doors and refused to take more patients. Other images showed doctors and nurses protesting about the lack of PPE, medicines and oxygen. </p> \n  <p>At least 45 members of the 30,000-strong Shipibo Konibo indigenous people have died from the coronavirus in Ucayali, the Amazon region of which Pucallpa is the capital, according to the local indigenous federation <a href=\"https://twitter.com/feconau1/status/1262055749380902914\">Feconau</a>. Many more are sick as Covid-19 has penetrated villages that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/south-america-indigenous-groups-coronavirus-brazil-colombia\">self-isolated</a> when the pandemic reached South America.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIn Pucallpa there is a total collapse of the three public hospitals, the private clinics are shut, and people are dying here every day,\u201d said Miguel Hilario-Manenima, a local university professor with a PhD from Stanford university. </p> \n  <p>As desperate patients gasp for air, an oxygen plant lies inoperative in the city, part of newly built hospital that was never completed, an investigation by <a href=\"https://elcomercio.pe/peru/ucayali/hospital-de-pucallpa-tiene-una-planta-de-oxigeno-inoperativa-por-obra-inconclusa-noticia/\">El Comercio newspaper</a> revealed.</p> \n  <p>As in Iquitos, oxygen has become a precious and overpriced resource in the hands of private companies who have quintupled the cost of a typical 10m3 canister, all sources consulted by The Guardian concurred. </p> \n  <p>Aoife Bennett, an honorary research associate from Oxford University working in Pucallpa, said indigenous communities were clubbing together to try to buy oxygen which had reached \u201cextortionate\u201d prices. A cylinder which cost about 600 soles (\u00a3144) before the pandemic began now costs between 3,500 soles (\u00a3843) and 5,000 soles (\u00a31,205).</p> \n  <p>\u201cI put money towards buying a ridiculously expensive cylinder of oxygen because I\u2019m trying to save a friend\u2019s life,\u201d said Bennett. \u201cBut it\u2019s absolutely disgusting that this should happen.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Peru\u2019s state social security body EsSalud said last week it expected to build a 100-bed field hospital in Pucallpa for Covid-19 patients which would be ready in three weeks.</p> \n  <p>Official figures for Ucayali report <a href=\"https://covid19.minsa.gob.pe/sala_situacional.asp\">2,032 coronavirus cases and 91 deaths</a> but local accounts report hundreds of deaths. One local cemetery <a href=\"https://rpp.pe/peru/ucayali/ucayali-cementerios-colapsan-en-pucallpa-mas-de-500-fallecidos-en-un-mes-pero-minsa-reporta-63-por-covid-19-noticia-1265720\">reported 421 deaths above the average</a> number of deceased during the last month. </p> \n  <p>Coronavirus cases in Peru rose to more than 94,000 on Monday, with a death toll of 2,789 according to official figures.

<p>Donald Trump has threatened to cut funding to the World Health Organization permanently and even pull the US out of the global body altogether unless it makes \u201cmajor substantive improvements\u201d which the president did not explain.</p> \n  <p>On Monday night, the president published the letter, citing a timeline of the organisation\u2019s alleged failings, which was based on a selective version of the pandemic, highlighting where the WHO had publicised Chinese findings on the nature of the disease, but ignoring or glossing over clear warnings from the organisation about the dangers of the contagion.</p> \n  <p>The move came hours after the US president told reporters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/18/trump-taking-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-fda-warnings\">he had been taking hydroxychloroquine for a couple of weeks</a>, despite warnings from his administration that it is dangerous. \u201cI think it\u2019s good, I heard a lot of good stories \u2026 I take a pill every day,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>The letter is the latest salvo in a war of words between Trump and the WHO that has unfolded in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The US president, who is under pressure at home over his response to the pandemic, temporarily <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-trump-halts-funding-to-world-health-organization\">froze funding to the WHO</a> in April, accusing the global body of \u201cseverely mismanaging and covering up\u201d the threat. At the time, critics were stunned at the move to cut money from a critical UN agency during a global pandemic.</p> \n  <p>Before Trump\u2019s letter, Tedros acknowledged there had been shortcomings and told the virtual assembly he welcomed calls for a review. \u201cI will initiate an independent evaluation at the earliest appropriate moment to review experience gained and lessons learned, and to make recommendations to improve national and global pandemic preparedness and response,\u201d he said. \u201cBut one thing is abundantly clear.

The letter states that if the WHO \u201cdoes not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days, I will make my temporary freeze of United States funding to the World Health Organization permanent and reconsider our membership of the organization.\u201d The letter states that the Trump administration\u2019s review into the WHO\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak \u201cconfirmed many of the serious concerns I raised...and identified others that the World Health Organization should have addressed, especially the World Health Organization\u2019s alarming lack of independence from the People\u2019s Republic of China.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>US deaths pass 90,000. </strong>The coronavirus death told in the US passed 90,000 Monday, and the number of cases climbed above 1.5m, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker.</li> \n   <li><strong>Brazil cases overtake UK to become third-highest worldwide. </strong>The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Brazil stands at 255,368, according to <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">Johns Hopkins University</a> figures, making the country the third-worst affected in terms of cases.There are 16,792 officially confirmed deaths in Brazil, which is lower than the UK, Italy, Spain and France.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>IMF chief says full economic recovery unlikely in 2021. </strong>The global economy will take much longer to recover fully from the shock caused by the new coronavirus than initially expected, the head of the International Monetary Fund said, and she stressed the danger of protectionism.

That is why it is my duty, as President of the United States, to inform you that, <strong>if the World Health Organization does not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days, I will make my temporary freeze of United States funding to the World Health Organization permane</strong>nt and <strong>reconsider our membership in the organization</strong>.

He has lived continuously in the UK, along with his wife and three daughters, since being discharged from the military in 2011, paying tax and National Insurance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"88e4a3bf3c0f00727a31a9d1f385f9a44f92911c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88e4a3bf3c0f00727a31a9d1f385f9a44f92911c/0_0_375_572/328.jpg\" alt=\"Lilieta Ratucaucau with her father Taitusi at her graduation ceremony.\" width=\"328\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lilieta Ratucaucau with her father Taitusi at her graduation ceremony.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Family</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Speaking to the Guardian with the permission of her parents, their 13-year-old daughter, Lilieta, said the ongoing immigration difficulties had left the family struggling financially. She said that she and her two younger sisters, aged eight and nine, had been \u201cscared and shaken\u201d by a visit to their home by Home Office staff, who questioned her mother.</p> <p>She said that worries about her family\u2019s immigration difficulties sometimes reduced her to tears and often made it hard for her to sleep, adding that she fears being forcibly sent to live in Fiji, a country she has never visited.</p> <p>\u201cMy father has been serving the Queen for 10 years,\u201d she said by telephone. \u201cIt would be devastating to have to leave here. Britain is our home.\u201d</p> <p> Lilieta wants to join the army when she leaves school after hearing her father\u2019s descriptions of his time serving in Afghanistan, Iraq and the Falkland Islands, but she knows she will face difficulties because her visa status is unresolved.</p> <p>Ratucaucau\u2019s two older daughters were born in Germany, while he was based there with the army. His youngest daughter was born in the UK and has no visa problems. Immigration uncertainties have made everyone in the family very unhappy. \u201cI\u2019m angry and embarrassed,\u201d Lilieta said.</p> <p>Ratucaucau is one of a group of Commonwealth-born military veterans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/08/commonwealth-veterans-accuse-uk-immigration-limbo-home-office-mod\">who launched legal action against the Home Office and the Ministry of Defence</a> earlier this year over an alleged systemic failure to advise them of the need to apply for settlement in the UK on discharge and for failing to assist them with complex, expensive immigration rules, which has left them categorised as illegal immigrants, struggling to access free NHS treatment, facing unemployment and fearing forced removal.</p> <p>They are unable to regularise their status due to rising visa costs and the complexity of the immigration system.</p> <p>Foreign national soldiers have the right to remain in the UK after leaving the army if they have served for at least four years, but claimants say they were discharged without being given clear guidance about how to regularise their immigration status. Most assumed the process was automatic. Ratucaucau would need to pay \u00a32,389 for each applicant, a total of \u00a39,556 for the family. Since being discharged from the army he has not been able to afford the sum.</p> <p>Visa fees have risen dramatically over the past decade as part of a government policy to cut immigration. Hospitals have been under an increased obligation since 2017 to check the immigration status of patients and to charge anyone who cannot prove eligibility in line with a series of measures designed to create a hostile environment for illegal migration.</p> <p>Ratucaucau said he had had no contact from the government officials and had no reason to think that the Ministry of Defence had changed its position. \u201cI am just hoping that they look at my situation and try to sort this,\u201d he said</p> <p> Charles Byrne, director general of the Royal British Legion, said: \u201cAs a nation we rely on the bravery and courage of our Commonwealth personnel yet, despite their years of service to this country, they currently have to pay thousands of pounds in fees if they and their families wish to remain in the UK after service.

Our NHS and care workers are working tirelessly to help support all those most in need.\u201d</p> <p>The SNP\u2019s Dr Philippa Whitford, who has been back on the frontline as a medical doctor for the past two months in Scotland, said a charge could only be justified for the initial year someone came to the UK because they would not have paid into the tax system yet.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s divisive and hypocritical to have politicians making a big deal of clapping for carers on a Thursday night and they say you\u2019ll have to pay \u00a3625 to use the service they\u2019re working in.

The following Thursday, she texted her husband from the bedroom: \u201cCall the ambulance, I can hardly breathe.\u201d</p> <p>She was taken to the VA hospital and put on a ventilator. On 17 March, as her organs began to fail, Thompson\u2019s colleagues connected to Bob on FaceTime so he could say goodbye.</p> <p>As a veteran, she qualified for an \u201chonor flight\u201d, in which the patient\u2019s body is covered with a black box and wheeled through the hospital while others line up and salute. Because of the infectious nature of the coronavirus, a US flag could not be safely draped over her body, so a family friend walked in front of her and carried it.</p> <p>Thompson said the ceremony drew more people lining the hallways than staff had seen in 20 years. \u201cGod\u2019s getting a hell of a nurse,\u201d he said.</p> <p><em>\u2013 MB</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6b25d82c26124f4c6ff733fe8842cf1a3e2ca03c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b25d82c26124f4c6ff733fe8842cf1a3e2ca03c/477_87_510_510/500.jpg\" alt=\"Photo of Alvin Simmons\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alvin Simmons.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Family of Alvin Simmons</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Alvin Simmons, 54<br></strong><em>After some struggles, Simmons turned his life around</em></p> <p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Environmental service assistant<br><strong>Place of work:</strong> Rochester general hospital in Rochester, New York<br><strong>Date of death:</strong> 17 March 2020</p> <p>Alvin Simmons started working as a custodian at Rochester general hospital, in New York state, only weeks before he fell ill. \u201cHe loved helping people and he figured the best place to do that would be in a hospital,\u201d his sister Michelle Wilcox said.</p> <p>An army veteran who had served in the first Gulf war, Simmons loved karaoke and doted on his three grandchildren, Wilcox said. \u201cHe was a dedicated, hard-working individual who had just changed his life around\u201d since a prison stint, she said.</p> <p>According to Wilcox, Simmons began developing symptoms shortly after cleaning the room of a woman he believed was infected with the novel coronavirus.

He was unable to produce it because the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/home-office\">Home Office</a> had it.</p> <p>He received an email from the Home Office on Tuesday informing him that his application has been successful and he had been granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK. \u201cI\u2019m still in shock but I can\u2019t stop smiling,\u201d he told the Guardian.</p> <p>Initially the Home Office denied ever having the passport but a recent letter from a Home Office official confirmed they had a record of it. \u201cHaving had a look through Mr Taqi\u2019s records it appears that we have seen a passport issued in 1993,\u201d the Home Office letter to his MP, Toby Perkins, stated.</p> <p>In November 2018 an immigration judge ruled that his passport was in possession of the Home Office.</p> <p>Taqi arrived in the UK in December 1992 for his sister\u2019s wedding shortly after the outbreak of civil war in Sierra Leone.

  "<p>Barely a week after racing resumed in France, the sport there suffered a major blow on Tuesday when a new government decree said it could not continue in areas particularly affected by Covid-19, described as red zones. That means most of the major tracks will have to be shuttered once more, including Longchamp, Chantilly and Auteuil, which was due to stage the French version of jump racing\u2019s Gold Cup a week on Sunday.<br><br>The news will cause many a furrowed brow among British racing officials, desperate to convince ministers that it will be safe for the sport here to resume from 1 June.

Its statement pointed out that the specified sanitary measures had been strictly observed since racing resumed at Longchamp at the beginning of last week and no problems are known to have arisen.<br><br>Officials are hastily redrafting the fixture list from Thursday, when the new law is expected to take effect.

  "<p>When the UK fully emerges from the coronavirus lockdown and shoppers are allowed out again for non-essential purchases, their local high street could be a very different place from the one they left in March. Since the pandemic gripped the nation, a string of big-name retailers have fallen into administration or announced store closures, and some of the shutters that were pulled down may not be lifted again.</p> <p>The failures of Laura Ashley, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/30/oasis-and-warehouse-to-permanently-close-shops-with-loss-of-1800-jobs\">Warehouse, Oasis</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/21/cath-kidston-to-close-all-60-uk-stores-with-loss-of-900-jobs\">Cath Kidston</a> did not go unnoticed, but the news stories were, of course, a footnote to other, more tragic, events. And, so far, to those who don\u2019t work for them, their loss has been invisible. But the job cuts at those retailers and other struggling brands, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/17/at-least-seven-debenhams-stores-close-loss-400-jobs\">Debenhams</a>, will be felt by thousands of families. And in the short term many high streets will be even more scarred than they were before lockdown.</p> <p>When I ask Mary Portas if it is the worst crisis ever to hit the high street, she points out that it goes far beyond that. She is on a video call from her home in Gloucestershire where, like many people, she is juggling work \u2013 for the consultancy that she founded \u2013 and home-schooling her young son. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst crisis to hit anybody in any kind of industry that relies on people having disposable income and actually being outside their homes,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Portas is keen to talk about what she calls \u201cthe kindness economy\u201d, a concept she has been considering for a while, but which she says is now going mainstream because of the coronavirus crisis. It\u2019s the subject of a newsletter she has launched, called the Reset, where she describes \u201ca new era of shopping and living\u201d, and she speaks passionately about it. But as someone who spent a year at the start of the last decade <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/dec/13/portas-high-streets-disapper\">looking at the problems of the high street</a>, and how to address them, she must be thinking about the state it is in now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b741de9952472f392015545119d2da5e95c7eccd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b741de9952472f392015545119d2da5e95c7eccd/0_156_4747_2847/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A locked-down high street in Slough.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A locked-down high street in Slough.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maureen McLean/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She says that what consumers are looking for has changed. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve gone through \u2013 certainly in the fashion industry \u2013 over the past 20 years is: \u2018How fast and how cheaply can we get this into the market?\u2019 And it was all about how quickly things were turned around. So you had businesses that were just fast fashion \u2013 it was about operations, it was about physics of the business,\u201d she adds.</p> <p>\u201cSome of those are crumbling, and we will see those falling. The same with some of the stores that were about more stuff, just stuff, stuff, stuff \u2013 your House of Frasers, your Debenhams, your Macy\u2019s in the US. It was just floor after floor of stuff, and that game is over.\u201d</p> <p>Since 2011, when Portas was tasked by the coalition government with fixing the problems of the high street, its decline has continued, and some of the problems will be exacerbated by the crisis. She notes councils will be strapped for cash, so things such as parking charges, which have perhaps deterred shoppers, are unlikely to be scrapped any time soon.</p> <p>The recession that followed the banking crisis led to the rise of Lidl and Aldi, while Poundland and Primark also prospered. She says that, this time around, that kind of retailer will be important again. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a real polarisation from those who have and those who have not,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see a real deep discounting happening at one end, where people are having to buy from those institutions. At the other end, there is going to be a growth in people buying and wanting brands that reflect their values.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Many local firms have woken up to: \u2018Actually I can do deliveries. I can get a digital presence'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For those who can afford to shop around, the companies that have proved heroes could find that the goodwill towards their brand lasts. \u201cWe keep a list in our agency of \u2018retail v corona\u2019 \u2013 who\u2019s doing well and who\u2019s not,\u201d she says. She doesn\u2019t divulge who has made it on to the list, but on social media it is clear that some companies have tarnished their reputations in the way they have reacted to the crisis, usually in their treatment of staff, while others have impressed people. In the early days, JD Wetherspoon and Waterstones both found their names preceded by #boycott on Twitter, after staff raised concerns about having to work. In contrast, the repair shop Timpson has won praise for its approach \u2013 topping up pay for furloughed staff so their income is not reduced.</p> <p>The idea that shoppers may be alert to how businesses treat them, their workers and the planet plays into something Portas was already talking about before all of this began. In<a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/mary_portas_welcome_to_the_kindness_economy\"> a recent TEDx talk, </a>she outlined her vision of a \u201ckindness economy\u201d where businesses thrive because they respect people and the environment.</p> <p>Today, she points to discounts for care workers and NHS staff as examples of this. \u201cYou look at the Met Ball and think: \u2018All of that stuff has been given to you free,\u2019\u201d she says, almost in horror, adding that maybe, instead, \u201cbusinesses, like the supermarkets, those everyday businesses, will say: \u2018Actually, no. We\u2019re going to do acts of kindness and decency with integrity, and give those discounts not to the people who have all the money, but to those who don\u2019t.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>When she put together the high street report in 2011, \u201cthey would say to me: \u2018Have you spoken to Sir Philip Green? Have you spoken to Sir Terry Leahy?\u2019\u201d And it was those at the top who had all of the power. Now, she says, we are what she calls more \u201csentient\u201d consumers, and businesses need to reflect our concerns to attract our money.</p> <p>She references Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England, who recently suggested the shift in values that would be sparked by the crisis. <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2020/04/16/mark-carney-on-how-the-economy-must-yield-to-human-values\">Writing in the Economist</a>, he said: \u201cFundamentally, the traditional drivers of value have been shaken, new ones will gain prominence, and there\u2019s a possibility that the gulf between what markets value and what people value will close.\u201d With this in mind, Portas says: \u201cEvery \u00a31 is a vote, a vote for how we want to live.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8491eb3628a1e946d948495f4784db8bcffe39d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8491eb3628a1e946d948495f4784db8bcffe39d2/0_177_5317_3191/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Laura Ashley shop after it went into administration.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Laura Ashley shop after it went into administration.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Naomi Baker/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although, during the lockdown, some spending has moved online, Portas says there is a \u201cpower\u201d to bricks-and-mortar shops: \u201cIf [people] do come into your store, they\u2019re two-and-a-half times more likely to buy.\u201d But some retailers are not delivering places that people want to go to.</p> <p>One thing she talked about in 2011 was support for small, local businesses. And it seems that the crisis has seen us turn to them in droves \u2013 according to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/13/uk-retailers-warn-of-shop-closures-and-job-losses-amid-lockdown\">Barclaycard, spending at local off-licences, greengrocers and convenience stores rose</a> by almost 40% in April. While this may have been fuelled by the difficulty of getting a supermarket delivery slot without setting your alarm clock for 4am, it may also have changed our shopping habits. A separate survey by the card provider found that many were planning to increase their spending at local butchers, cafes and farmers\u2019 markets in the future.</p> <p>Portas says the crisis has changed the mindset of some of these businesses and talks enthusiastically about examples she has seen in her local community. \u201cMany of them have woken up to: \u2018Actually I can do deliveries. I can get a digital presence,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI was talking to [a bookshop owner] the other day, and they said: \u2018I\u2019d never had a website before and I\u2019ve set it up, and I\u2019ve already taken 25% of what I took last year.

  "<p>Now more than ever we could do with firm leadership, strong example-setting, and a nationwide feeling of unity that comes from knowing that We\u2019re All In This Together. Good of Prince Charles to put on his best rumpled gardening jacket and stand <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/prince-charles-encourages-jobless-people-22050534\">port-faced in his own garden</a> telling us all to pick some fruit, then. I was just thinking, \u201cYou know what would really get me through the endless doom of this pandemic? Inexpertly grabbing potatoes out of the ground for absolute minimum wage.\u201d And just like that, Charlie came through.</p> <p>In case you have missed this because you have been indoors desperately trying to do your job through a series of janky video calls while also juggling childcare and shopping for food despite the constant restrictions and doing a bit of exercise without going within two metres of another person while doing it \u2013 lockdown resembling a complicated fox\u2013chicken\u2013grain river-crossing task rather than a genuine public health measure \u2013 then what you\u2019ve missed is this: Britain\u2019s crops are under threat of mouldering on the vine, and you need to do something about it. Normally this wouldn\u2019t be a problem because our agriculture industry has relied<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/28/fruit-and-veg-will-run-out-unless-britain-charters-planes-to-fly-in-farm-workers-from-eastern-europe\"> on seasonal migrant workers</a>, but a combination of pandemic flight restrictions and years of government-sanctioned xenophobia have painted us into a bit of a corner, potato-and-pear wise. Hence, Prince Charles.</p> <p>The solution to this mooted at the start of lockdown was the <a href=\"https://pickforbritain.org.uk/\">Pick For Britain</a><a href=\"https://pickforbritain.org.uk/\"> campaign</a> \u2013 a flimsily rebranded version of world war two\u2019s Women\u2019s Land Army \u2013 for which British workers at a loose end are recruited en masse to get the strawberries in. Or that\u2019s the theory, anyway: even with long-term furloughs and job losses, the number of people signing up to spend two entire seasons living in farm-provided accommodation (with the rent often deducted from your minimum wage pay) and waking up at 5am for some reason just to go face-to-face with some asparagus has been low. It\u2019s estimated we need 80,000 extra workers tilling the fields. As <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/prince-charles-mobilises-a-new-land-army-0sgp9ztgm\">reported</a> in the Times, the work placement charity Concordia said of 50,000 people initially interested, 6,000 made it to interview, 1,000 rejected jobs that they were offered, and only 150 took up offers of work. Farming is no longer the Enid Blyton-esque jolly-good-day\u2019s-work-and-a-pint-of-ale-for-your-trouble! it used to be. It\u2019s just hard graft for very little money, possibly Britain\u2019s most sacred tradition.</p> <p>That\u2019s why Pick For Britain got the big guns involved: Waitrose\u2019s very own in-house royal. \u201cIf we are to harvest British fruit and vegetables this year, we need an army of people to help,\u201d the Prince said, one hand in his pocket. \u201cIn the coming months, many thousands of people will be needed to bring in the crops. It will be hard graft but it is hugely important \u2026 People are needed who are genuinely going to commit. The phrase I have often heard is, \u2018pickers who are stickers\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>There are some very loaded terms in there, aren\u2019t there? Prince Charles saying \u201chard graft\u201d alone should be enough to get the Robespierres among us fired up. The idea that he is parroting cool farming lingo that he has heard but never had to learn through work does rather put the (British-grown!) cherry on the sundae, too. Pick literally one brussels sprout out the ground, Prince Charles.

  "<p>Clap for them, then charge them. This is the how the Conservatives treat migrant key workers. For all the admiration and thanks heaped upon these workers during the coronavirus pandemic, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/16/home-office-priti-patel-failure-to-scrap-nhs-migrant-surcharge-sparks-anger\">the government</a> has refused to scrap the NHS immigration surcharge. The majority of non-EU migrants, including those who work in the NHS, will have to pay the surcharge on top of taxes, national insurance contributions and extortionate immigration fees.</p> <p>And so it has to be said plainly: the government praises NHS workers for providing life-saving care, then makes them pay through the nose to access that same care themselves. Migrant staff have to pay twice for the very healthcare system they work for. Just because they are immigrants.</p> <p>When confronted with this contradiction at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/government-reviewing-nhs-surcharge-for-migrant-medics\">the end of April</a>, Priti Patel suggested the surcharge was \u201cunder review\u201d. This has been the home secretary\u2019s standard response of late: whenever Patel has been presented with evidence showing the deleterious impact of the government\u2019s immigration policies, she\u2019ll say they\u2019re being looked at.</p> <p>In an attempt to wriggle out of this claim, Patel\u2019s department then said she had never promised any formal review of the NHS surcharge. Instead, this was just Patel referring to the fact that \u201call government policies are continuously kept under review\u201d. Used again yesterday by foreign secretary Dominic Raab, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNews/status/1262425636855074818?s=20\">without a hint of irony</a>, this is a handy catchphrase the government uses to avoid scrutiny.</p> <p>Stopping short of doing nothing, the Conservatives have done the absolute bare minimum to change the policy. Until October, doctors, nurses and paramedics will be exempt from paying the surcharge for a year as part of an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/nhs-frontline-workers-visas-extended-so-they-can-focus-on-fighting-coronavirus\">automatic visa extension</a>. The concession amounts to crumbs from the master\u2019s table: pause it for a year and then, once the clapping has stopped, continue as if nothing has happened.</p> <p>This one-year exemption is a scrap that\u2019s not even considered for other migrant key workers: the care workers, supermarket staff, porters and cleaners who have put their lives on the line during this pandemic are only a few of those not given a temporary pass. They will still have to pay up. \u201cI wanted to do nursing but I couldn\u2019t afford overseas student fees, so I decided to be a care worker and I\u2019m working hard,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/coronavirus-nhs-visa-extensions-uk-doctors-nurses-a9444056.html\">Shantel Murray told </a><a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/coronavirus-nhs-visa-extensions-uk-doctors-nurses-a9444056.html\">the Independent</a>. \u201cRight now I\u2019m doing all I can to help the community. But I just feel so undervalued.\u201d</p> <p>Kimesha is a care worker who is paid only \u00a39 an hour. She can barely afford the surcharge and visa costs for herself and her three children, so has had to take a second job. \u201cIt is very stressful because it keeps going up. It is a struggle for people like me who aren\u2019t earning enough to pay rent, council tax and bills. It should be abolished for everyone,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/03/calls-grow-scrap-nhs-surcharge-migrant-healthcare-workers-coronavirus\">she told the Guardian</a>. Care-worker badges and platitudes are no substitute for policy change.</p> <p>The surcharge has tripled in price in less than two years. At the end of 2018 it was \u00a3200 for an adult; now it\u2019s \u00a3400 and is set to rise again, to \u00a3624, on 1 October this year. For anyone under the age of 18 it will be \u00a3470, meaning for a family of two adults and two children, it will cost \u00a32,188 to use the NHS each year.</p> <p>Matt Hancock <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MattHancock/status/1195997609942560768?s=20\">defended the increase</a> during the general election campaign, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s the national health service not the international health service.\u201d Here is the myth of British exceptionalism. In 1971, <a href=\"http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/immigration-and-the-national-health-service-putting-history-to-the-forefron\">around 30% of doctors working in NHS</a> were born overseas. That figure is still roughly the same. The government wants an exclusively \u201cnational\u201d health service, just one that is staffed by \u201cinternational\u201d workers \u2013 who then have to pay to access the health service themselves.</p> <p>The government justifies the surcharge, saying it \u201censures that migrants make a proper financial contribution to the cost of their NHS care\u201d. Except they already do \u2013 it\u2019s called taxes.</p> <p>The duplicity of the surcharge is painfully obvious. If any lesson is learned from this pandemic, it should be that healthcare is a universal, basic right, whether you\u2019re a key worker or not. The \u201cgood migrant\u201d/\u201cbad migrant\u201d binary is a dead end. Nobody should have to pay twice to access it just because they weren\u2019t born in this country.</p> <p>This one policy, callous though it is, is emblematic of a much bigger problem: how the government treats all migrants. Though not officially part of the \u201chostile environment\u201d, the NHS surcharge was introduced at the same time as many of the policies that fall under this infamous title. Most remain in operation \u2013 despite the Windrush scandal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/21/right-to-rent-rule-justified-finds-uk-appeal-court\">court rulings</a>, endless cases that show the damage they\u2019ve done and a global pandemic.

Adding more up-to-date death tolls reported to regulators and deaths of care home residents in hospitals to 1 May, it means 14,835 care residents have died from Covid-19.</p> \n<p>UK care homes are demanding a significant increase in testing of staff and residents, up to three times a week, amid fears a lifting of the lockdown could spark new outbreaks.</p> \n<p>So far, the UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, has promised only that all care home residents and staff will be tested by 6 June, but no commitment has been made for repeat testing.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople are often finding their tests aren\u2019t arriving on time or being taken away on time,\u201d said Green. \u201cWe are looking at delays of eight to 10 days until people get results.\u201d</p> \n<p>The call for routine testing was echoed by Sir David Behan, the chief executive of HC-One, the largest private provider, and Sam Monaghan, the chief executive of MHA, the largest charitable provider.</p> \n<p>Vic Rayner, the executive director at the National Care Forum, which represents charitable care operators, said the promise of 30,000 tests a day was enough only for one test each for care residents and staff.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat that means is you haven\u2019t got the right tools and resources to manage outbreaks within homes and identify when and where infections might have come in,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly challenging for providers to operate in that climate. It is absolutely critical that we get that repeat testing.\u201d</p> \n<p>The committee also heard warnings about the continued risk posed by temporary care workers spreading the virus if they work in more than one home.

  "<p>Mark Acasio says he and his gorilla suit are joining the Las Vegas Raiders this fall. Acasio, a long-time fan from Brentwood, California, known far and wide as Gorilla Rilla, has shelled out $3,500 for home-game tickets and $8,500 for a <a href=\"https://lasvegassun.com/news/2017/aug/24/faq-psls-personal-seat-licenses-raiders-stadium/\">personal-seat license</a> (PSL) for a front-row seat at Allegiant Stadium, the Raiders\u2019 posh new home.</p> <p>Acasio has not missed a Raiders\u2019 home game in 25 years. Just because the Raiders will now be a one-hour flight from his home instead of a one-hour drive, he is determined to stay loyal to the team and to his comrades moving to Vegas from the Black Hole, the NFL\u2019s most infamous cheering section, at dingy Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum.</p> <p>\u201cOn the other hand, many other friends of mine have not, and will not, step foot in Las Vegas,\u201d Acasio tells The Guardian.</p> <p>They won\u2019t because Las Vegas is not exactly around the corner from the Bay Area, and because tickets in the sections at Allegiant Stadium envisioned as a New Black Hole are about double what they were in Oakland \u2013 $218.75 in Vegas, up to $110 in Oakland. There was a PSL in Oakland, but as far as anyone can remember, it was not much more than $500.</p> <p>But that is only half of the issue. Oakland had the Raiders twice: from 1960 until 1982, when they moved to Los Angeles for 13 years, and then again from 1995 through last season. The Raiders won two Super Bowls in their first stint in Oakland and another in Los Angeles, but the second stay was pretty bleak, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Las_Vegas_Raiders_seasons\">with only one winning season since 2002</a>.</p> <p>Although they knew that Mark Davis, the Raiders\u2019 owner and son of Al Davis, the legendary former Raiders\u2019 coach and owner, had tried in vain for years to replace the obsolete Coliseum, many of the team\u2019s long-suffering fans were enraged that the team abandoned the Bay Area again \u2013 and that Davis was hardly nostalgic about Oakland.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/aug/11/oakland-raiders-move-las-vegas-nfl-fans-city-impact\">The Raiders helped unite the divisions in Oakland.

The Black Hole is also a global fan club with thousands of members. </p> <p>But the Black Hole is, well, <a href=\"https://theblackhole.com/\">let the club\u2019s website explain it</a>:</p> <p><em>We are a STATE OF MIND. Our state of mind has united the entire Raiders Nation over the years. We have grown from a few friends to a worldwide family made up of generations of fans young and old, from all ethnicities, races, and sexes. If you bleed SILVER and BLACK, then we are connected and you are spiritually part of us.</em></p> <p>Rob Rivera, a resident of Hayward, California, who is the president and co-founder of the Black Hole, tells the Guardian, \u201cThe move has broken our hearts, pissed us off. They proved loyalty is a one-way street in the NFL.\u201d</p> <p>Deboe was not a Black Hole denizen: \u201cThey stand up too long for me,\u201d says Deboe, who is retired and lives in Castro Valley, California. But he feels burned, too. Like Rivera, Deboe figures he will go to one or two Raiders\u2019 home games per season in Las Vegas, probably using tickets purchased by a season-ticket holder (with a PSL).</p> <p>Deboe is sure he won\u2019t become a San Francisco 49ers\u2019 fan. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely out of the question,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cNobody will do that.\u201d</p> <p>The Raiders did not return several emails from the Guardian about duplicating the Black Hole in Vegas. Marc Badain, the team president, <a href=\"https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/stadium/fear-not-raiders-fans-black-hole-will-live-on-in-las-vegas-1939654/\">told the Las Vegas Review-Journal in January</a>: \u201cA lot of the folks that sit in the Black Hole in Oakland bought tickets in the south end zone at Allegiant. Whether that happens organically, we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d</p> <p>Deboe, for one, is not optimistic that will happen. He says that is \u201cbecause Las Vegas is a destination city. A lot of people take trips there from all over the country. Fans of other teams will see a road game in Vegas and will want to make a weekend of it. Oakland was a sold-out stadium of locals.\u201d</p> <p>There is a Black Hole chapter in Las Vegas, a good start. The chapter president is Cisco \u201cKid\u201d Ortega, whose job was relocated from the Bay Area to Vegas before the Raiders made their move. Ortega says the team has not been in touch with him, but when asked about a Black Hole II, he says \u201cWe are going to do our best to duplicate that.\u201d</p> <p>The chapter threw a Super Bowl party at the Westgate Hotel in Las Vegas just to get the ball rolling, although the coronavirus pandemic scuttled plans for the NFL to host its draft in Las Vegas in April, denying the Black Hole club some inevitable TV screen time and valuable publicity. Ortega is still optimistic for success in Vegas, though he understands the challenges.</p> <p>\u201cI know I can speak for many of us Oakland fans when I say this second relocation will always hurt,\u201d he says. \u201cMany of us, including myself, will not wear any Raider gear that says \u2018Las Vegas\u2019. However, what\u2019s done is done, and we, The Black Hole, have to continue on with what we\u2019ve built in the past 25 years.\u201d</p> <p>When plans for Allegiant Stadium were revealed, Raiders fans were horrified to note that an area in the stadium outside the north end zone that would be ideal for another Black Hole was taken up by club seating. But the Raiders said there could be a Black Hole at the other end. About 15% of the season tickets in Vegas were sold to fans from northern California.</p> <p>But will the Black Hole, or can the Black Hole, really ever be the same? Gorilla Rilla will be there, and he is determined to make the place look and sound like Oakland. All the team has to do, whenever or however the NFL season starts, is to win more games and give whoever shows up at its new stadium more to cheer.</p> <p>\u201cI will continue pounding my chest to the Silver and Black among our Raider Family from Vegas to around the country,\u201d says Acasio, ever the noble warrior to the cause. \u201cI\u2019ve visited 30 stadiums and have stepped foot in Mexico City, London and Germany, and I have always represented my Black Hole Banner and Raider Nation.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Children in England may return to school before the government\u2019s coronavirus contact tracing app is rolled out across the country, the work and pensions secretary, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, has confirmed.</p> \n<p>The app which was due to be released in mid-May following its trial on the Isle of Wight is now expected in the \u201ccoming weeks\u201d the minister said.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not aware that\u2019s been set as a condition that\u2019s necessary for the phased reopening of primary schools,\u201d she told BBC Breakfast. <br><br>\u201cI think it is better to get the app as good as we can make it rather than rush out an app and have to change it.<br><br>\u201cSo it\u2019s important that that trial, that pilot in the Isle of Wight, is allowed to run to its full length that\u2019s needed, rather than perhaps the target deadline that the health secretary has set.\u201d</p> \n<p>The government has recruited 21,000 contact tracers as part of its test, track and trace strategy and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, had previously committed to the NHS app being ready for the rest of England in the middle of this month.</p> \n<p>Reception, year one and year six are due back in smaller class sizes in schools on 1 June, which has prompted significant concern from teaching unions over staff safety.</p> \n<p>The minister said the app is only one element of the tracing system the government is developing when it was suggested on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that it may be needed to give people confidence to return to work and school.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn terms of the app it\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019ve announced that we will get that out as soon as possible but it\u2019s important on the app \u2013 and it\u2019s only one element of the tracing \u2013 is that we make sure we get it right,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>The \u00a3625 NHS surcharge that migrant workers from outside the European Economic Area must pay, even if they work for the NHS, and paid on top of visa fees, is correct in principle, Coffey told Sky News.</p> \n<p>There has been criticism that foreign care workers helping with the coronavirus outbreak still face the charge, which is rising from \u00a3400 to \u00a3625 this autumn.

  "<p>Electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) are set to transform our lives. Batteries are improving, bolstering their performance and range, while charging points are becoming an increasingly common part of the roadside. Many of us are excited by the potential for low or emission-free transport, plus the prospect of connectivity and, in time, driverless vehicles. Certainly, electric vehicles (EVs) could theoretically transform transportation. But the actual numbers of EVs and PHEVs on our roads is still very low, so when exactly will this revolution begin?</p> <p>Of all of the <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/383023/new-car-units-registered-in-the-united-kingdom-uk-by-fuel-type/\" rel=\"nofollow\">cars purchased in 2019, just 7.3% used \u201calternative fuels\u201d</a>. But figures show their numbers have been rising year on year for the past decade.</p> <p>Electric cars, in one form or another, have been around since the 19th century, but these were very much supplanted by their diesel and petrol counterparts in the century that followed. However, since the turn of the 21st century, major automakers have been ramping up their efforts. For instance, BMW launched concept versions of its all-electric BMW i3 series and a plug-in hybrid, called BMW i8, at the 2009 International Motor Show; it now has a range of 10 PHEVs, from the 2 Series Active Tourer to the X5. EVs and PHEVs are now a major part of carmakers\u2019 ranges. By 2023, BMW plans to have 25 electrified vehicles in production, with 12 of those being fully electric.</p> <p>Governments, too, are planning and investing in an electric future for transportation. The UK government will ban the sale of petrol and diesel in 2035 and other European countries are acting similarly.</p> <p><strong>Tipping point<br></strong>Michael Woodward, UK automotive lead at Deloitte, says EVs will rise in popularity during the 2020s. \u201cThe inclusion of hybrids in the UK\u2019s incoming ban on new petrol and diesel car sales from 2035 could slow demand in the longer term but, for now, hybrids continue to be seen as a stepping stone to going fully electric.\u201d</p> <p>Furthermore, Woodward predicts the market is now ready for EVs. \u201cWhile the uptake of EVs is unlikely to overtake demand for traditional petrol or diesel cars any time soon, a tipping point is likely to be reached in 2021.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Charge points<br></strong>There are well-known practical issues with EVs that have led the public to be nervous about purchasing one. The biggest issue is probably the fear of getting a flat battery and being unable to charge up, a problem known in the industry as \u201crange anxiety\u201d. An immediate solution for anyone nervous about range anxiety would be to look to a PHEV, which switches to conventional fuels on longer journeys but remains fully electric for shorter trips. For instance, all of BMW\u2019s plug-in hybrid vehicles have an electric range that can cover the average commute, which is 26 miles a day.</p> <p>Alexander Lewis-Jones, senior analyst at energy consultancy Delta-EE, believes a lot has been done in terms of improving the UK\u2019s charging infrastructure to also combat this issue. He says: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about range anxiety being a barrier to uptake, but our research shows this shouldn\u2019t be the case, as the UK has more than 31,450 charge points accessible to the public. While this is a strong number, we can\u2019t get complacent and should be urging local authorities to install charge points in their area.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9a8e313504bc7e5a372104b879fc9813065ef4a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a8e313504bc7e5a372104b879fc9813065ef4a8/0_219_2632_3289/800.jpg\" alt=\"Supporting P90243367 highRes bmw-i-wallbox-for-ch\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Most UK EV drivers charge their vehicle at home</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Delta-EE\u2019s research suggests the UK government has invested in the region of \u00a3300-400m in public charging infrastructure. There has also been the development of \u201crapid charging\u201d points for travellers in a hurry. A new industry is emerging, designed to keep EV users moving. However, in the UK, the majority of EV drivers charge up at home.</p> <p><strong>Efficiency</strong><br>Richard Seale, lead automotive designer at Seymourpowell says that, from an energy efficiency point of view, EVs come out on top. \u201cEVs are more efficient at turning energy into motion,\u201d says Seale. \u201cElectric motors turn between 85-90% of stored energy into movement, while ICEs (internal combustion engines) are down to around 15-25%.\u201d</p> <p>For Seale, the arguments for EVs are clear. However, the public has tended to associate EVs with lower performance and charging issues, and these factors, combined with a higher price, make them a hard purchase to justify.<br><br>\u201cActually buying one hasn\u2019t always been an easy choice to make,\u201d says Seale. \u201cEven though consumer attitudes are changing, ultra-low emission vehicles still only represent a tiny percentage of cars on the road in the UK. That aside, if you look at the accelerating growth rate: 1,732% between 2010 and 2018, it is clear that we are seeing a fundamental change in the automotive industry. I firmly believe that, eventually, EVs will be by far in the majority on British roads.\u201d<br><br>Analysts and industry expect the 2020s to see both transport and energy infrastructures become far more reliant on batteries. But some are sceptical that EVs are great for the environment. Yet Seale says EVs and PHEVs do mark progress.</p> <p>\u201cOne key point that is often argued is: \u2018The energy has to come from somewhere.\u2019 The issue with this argument is that, while it is still true that the majority of energy in the UK grid comes from fossil fuels, using an ICE solution as the end user will never improve this. However, opting for an EV means you make up part of a developing infrastructure of clean energy, an infrastructure that is only getting better.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/plug-into-hybrid/2020/may/19/how-much-did-the-first-mobile-phone-weigh-take-our-electrifying-quiz\">How much did the first mobile phone weigh?

  "<p>As the UK begins to ease lockdown restrictions, attention has turned to the prospect of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/16/gps-press-ministers-for-clear-testing-strategy-to-avoid-second-wave-of-coronavirus\">second wave</a> of coronavirus cases. In Germany, where shops and restaurants have tentatively reopened, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/coronavirus-germany-cases-spread-lockdown-lifted-r-number-a9507571.html\">the reproduction number </a><a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/coronavirus-germany-cases-spread-lockdown-lifted-r-number-a9507571.html\">R</a><a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/coronavirus-germany-cases-spread-lockdown-lifted-r-number-a9507571.html\"> has risen to 1.1</a>. In Seoul, a recent outbreak of at least 170 infections has been linked to five bars and nightclubs. Even in South Korea, one of the most successful countries at controlling the virus, there\u2019s no room for complacency.</p> <p>As a veterinary epidemiologist, I study how viruses spread between animals and animal populations. The principles of viral transmission are much the same in humans (indeed, many scientists work on both). The concept of a second wave in public health is often linked to factors outside of human control. This might include the birth of infants who are susceptible to a particular disease causing the wavelike patterns we see in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/414716a\">childhood illnesses</a>, or environmental factors that influence the <a href=\"https://jvi.asm.org/content/86/8/4279\">seasonality of influenza</a>. But for Covid-19, the anticipation of a second wave has more to do with actions within our control.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What\u2019s as important as the R number is the total number of cases across a population that an R increase would cause</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Shifts in social behaviour create more opportunities for human contact. In China, <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china/russian-border-becomes-chinas-frontline-in-fight-against-second-virus-wave-idUKKCN21V06R\">the entry of people with coronavirus</a> across the Russian border is one example where easing restrictions resulted in new cases of the virus. Meanwhile in Germany, <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-breaks-out-in-third-german-slaughterhouse/a-53389860\">outbreaks of coronavirus linked to abattoirs</a> where employees live in poor housing conditions is a reminder that the R number can also increase when vulnerable individuals are exposed to the virus for the first time.</p> <p>The potential rise in R after lockdown measures are relaxed is something that epidemiologists are well aware of. If the government delivers an effective testing and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/15/epidemiologists-contact-tracing-coronavirus\">contact-tracing strategy</a> that can bring the virus under control by the time lockdown measures are lifted for everyone, new cases of Covid-19 would theoretically be little cause for concern \u2013 as health authorities would have measures in place to identify and curb incipient outbreaks.</p> <p>What\u2019s of greater concern to epidemiologists are indications that the R number is rising uncontrollably, or in a way that increases the exposure of the most vulnerable or puts health systems under great strain. In other words, what\u2019s as important as the R number is the total number of cases across a population that an increase in R would cause. While the increase in Germany\u2019s R number is concerning, this would be far more alarming were it to occur in the UK, where there are currently many more cases of coronavirus.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/regional-differences-in-covid-19-transmission-rate-emerge-in-england\">Regional differences</a> in the value of R are also important. Easing the lockdown in areas with greater health resources, fewer Covid-19 cases and where more people have already had the virus, may be practical compared with another part of the country where outcomes of an increasing R would be more severe. Differences in the R number among particular risk groups, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/agency-staff-were-spreading-covid-19-between-care-homes-phe-found-in-april\">care home residents</a>, are also likely to be more meaningful than the value of R for the country as a whole. Again, we\u2019ll need a widespread programme of testing and tracing to determine these risks, and enable health authorities to rapidly contain incipient outbreaks.</p> <p>Intuitively, we know that if contact between people with Covid-19 and those susceptible to infection increases, the R number is likely to rise. But this doesn\u2019t happen in a straightforward way. A 10% increase in contact doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a 10% increase in R, or a 10% increase in overall risk of catching the virus. Understanding how contact between people affects transmission, whether it be transmission of hate messages via a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06930-7\">malicious bot on the internet</a> or transmission of a virus from an infected person, is a pivotal concept in the field of \u201cnetwork science\u201d.</p> <p>For Covid-19, a single contact can endanger an otherwise isolated community. Once an infection is introduced, the results can be <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-52676174\">disastrous</a>. In network science, this pattern is described as a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/30918\">small-world</a>\u201d effect. The concept originated from the idea that individuals with apparently little in common often have connections they are unaware of. What this means for public health is that even if only a handful of people have the potential to expose other communities to disease risk, in communities that are geographically distant or isolated, the impact of those few people on the spread of a virus can be significant. In the case of coronavirus, many areas in the UK have only experienced small outbreaks so far, creating fewer opportunities for the effects of \u201cherd immunity\u201d to curb the risk of a future outbreak.</p> <p>To understand why mass gatherings are so important for infection, we can use a second concept borrowed from network science, that of \u201cscale-free networks\u201d. This is when some individuals in a network have a disproportionate number of contacts compared with the average. Gatherings are one context in which a single individual who is infected with Covid-19 could have many more contacts with other people than average. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15842.1\">Emerging scientific research suggests</a> that some individuals may be responsible for infecting many more people than others. One crucial question, which scientists haven\u2019t yet answered, is whether these patterns are driven by more contact or differences in infectiousness.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/18/sage-advice-britain-coronavirus-science-government-policy\">The Sage advice must be published now to find where Britain got coronavirus wrong | Anthony Costello</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mass gatherings become more significant if such events occur frequently, with at least some of the same individuals returning repeatedly to the same place. This is often the case for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/14/angelo-ogbonna-accuses-premier-league-ignoring-coronavirus-risk\">scheduled football matches</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/churches-consider-ticketing-when-they-reopen-after-lockdown-coronavirus\">religious services</a>, both of which occur weekly \u2013 an interval conveniently similar to the time it takes a person infected with coronavirus <a href=\"https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.17.2000257\">to become infectious to others</a>. Gatherings both increase the opportunities to become infected and increase the chances of infecting other people. If a few people who are infected with coronavirus come into contact with many others, the<a href=\"https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.64.066112\"> risk of a rapid spread can become uncontrollable</a>. And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/21/experts-inquiry-cheltenham-festival-coronavirus-deaths\">some events</a> present both kinds of risk: drawing in many people from great distances, and holding them together in close contact for an extended period.</p> <p>Lowering our chance of a second wave will require minimising the impact of both of these factors. This means restricting large gatherings, especially where individuals might repeat these over the course of a single infection, and restricting movements over long distances, or those with a higher probability of putting vulnerable groups at risk. Crucially, it also means having in place a testing and tracing strategy that allows health authorities to identify new cases of Covid-19. These concepts are intuitive, but what network science tells us is that the risk associated with even a small change in patterns of human contact can be substantial.</p> <p>\u2022 Rowland Kao is the Sir Timothy O\u2019Shea Professor of Veterinary Epidemiology and Data Science at the University of Edinburgh, and is working with Public Health Scotland on coronavirus modelling. </p>",

The follow-up to Grisham\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/camino-island-9781473663749.html\">Camino Island</a></em>, it\u2019s very different in tone to his legal thrillers \u2013 more tongue in cheek, with a lightness of touch and humour that is very welcome these days. Bruce Cable, owner of a bookstore on the idyllic Florida island and host of expansive dinner parties for the community of local writers, is enjoying a drink or two when Hurricane Leo blows in, devastating the island and leaving his friend, popular crime author Nelson Kerr, dead.</p> <p>Bruce and his buddies don\u2019t believe it\u2019s an accident \u2013 \u201cYou\u2019re thinking somebody came over here in the middle of a category four hurricane, caught Nelson in the den, whacked him in the head, dragged his body outside, tried to clean up the blood, and than ran off. Seriously?\u201d \u2013 but Camino island isn\u2019t set up for a proper murder investigation; the \u201chomicide guy\u201d in the local police force also does bank robberies, and is pretty hopeless. So Bruce and co start investigating, and discover that whoever killed Nelson may well have wanted to prevent his next book coming out. The plot becomes increasingly outlandish, but mostly in a good way: Grisham knows exactly what he\u2019s doing, and this is a fine way to while away an afternoon in lockdown.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/heatstroke-9781472265609.html\">Heatstroke</a></h2> <p>Hazel Barkworth<br><em>Headline, \u00a316.99, pp320</em></p> <p>Rachel is a secondary school English teacher, and mother of a teenager, 15-year-old Mia, in Hazel Barkworth\u2019s debut novel, which spirals deep into Rachel\u2019s secrets after her daughter\u2019s best friend Lily disappears in the midst of an increasingly hot summer. Unable to get through to her own child, Rachel becomes increasingly obsessed with helping to find Lily. \u201cShe had spent over 15 years watching teenagers. She could read their glances, detect their brags and their shifts\u201d \u2013 but the secrets she uncovers as she investigates hold up a mirror to her own life, and the choices she makes will come back to haunt her.</p> <p>Barkworth is excruciatingly good at encapsulating that point in life where Mia and Lily stand, on the edge of growing up \u2013 Lily\u2019s abandoned bedroom is \u201cheartbreaking. Its walls were the shade of purple that must have thrilled Lily six or seven years ago, and every corner was filled with the whispers of her childhood\u201d.

Unfortunately for Alistair, he is almost immediately mugged and loses his passport, and after also losing a job as a labourer, he is rescued from destitution only by a mysterious, wealthy artist, Heinrich, who wants Alistair to recruit tourists to pose (and possibly do more) for him.</p> <p>We know from the start that Alistair has ended up in jail for murder, and <em>The Lizard</em> follows the parties and general debauchery that led to that charge, and the wild plans for escape and revenge that follow. Alistair is nothing if not gullible, trusting women because they\u2019re beautiful and saying pompous things like: \u201cI was after the innate wisdom of my primeval forefathers, where the only qualification needed was an ability to hunt and fight; a stripped-back, honest existence.\u201d But that\u2019s all part of the fun, and this riotous chase through the glory of the Greek islands is entertaining, if somewhat preposterous.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/remain-silent-9780008273798.html\">Remain Silent</a></h2> <p>Susie Steiner<br><em>Borough Press, \u00a314.99, pp368</em></p> <p>In the third book in Steiner\u2019s excellent series about DI Manon Bradshaw, the 46-year-old is trying to balance life as a mother to a young child and partner to a man who might be seriously ill with her now part-time job as a detective. \u201cHer sexual fantasies, such as they are, generally involve men performing minor DIY while retaining their emotional equilibrium.\u201d It opens as she takes her son to the park and discovers the body of a migrant hanging from a tree, a note attached reading \u201cThe dead cannot speak\u201d.</p> <p>After somehow managing to conceal the sight from her son, Manon embarks on an investigation, digging into the awful truth about life for migrant workers in Britain, not least the growing hatred of the incomers stoked by the far rightamong the locals.

  "<p>Growing up, there weren\u2019t many films that I had watched so many times that I knew not just the lines but also the songs off by heart, but Dirty Dancing was one of them. I was way too young to see it at the cinema when it first came out in 1987, but caught it a few years later on TV, recording it on to a VHS tape so I could replay my favourite scenes. I was thrilled. I was a bookish kid who felt intensely shy and awkward. And there on my screen was a not-that-shy but definitely studious and awkward teenager being swept off her feet, literally, by Patrick Swayze.</p> <p>That\u2019s pretty much where any similarities with Frances \u201cBaby\u201d Houseman, played by Jennifer Grey, end. I wasn\u2019t from a well-off family, didn\u2019t go on fancy holidays and couldn\u2019t dance to save my life. But living in a drab town in the deepest suburbs of Surrey, I did know what it was like to be bored with your perfectly fine but humdrum life and hanker for something more exciting, however briefly. Although I was only 12 so my options were limited. Dance was Baby\u2019s escape, mine was the film. And the story of her holiday romance with dance instructor Johnny Castle (Swayze) transported me to a world of 1960s nostalgia and great music.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIcmQNy9FsM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eIcmQNy9FsM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Rewatching it many years later, it didn\u2019t take me long to remember why I had loved it so much. It\u2019s the first time we \u2013 and Baby, who has just arrived with her family to Kellerman\u2019s resort in the Catskill mountains \u2013 see Johnny in action. He\u2019s not so much dancing with his super flexible partner Penny as melding into her as they show off their skills in a packed ballroom. The effect is electrifying. The dance sequences throughout the film are equally as thrilling; flitting between sweet and playful to flirty and sexy and then downright raunchy. I have always adored a good dance movie \u2013 I\u2019m a sucker for a sassy shake of the hip and a well-choreographed musical number.</p> <p>But the main reason that VHS tape was played over and over again when I was 12 was that Dirty Dancing was one of the most swooningly romantic films I\u2019d seen in my young life. After Baby breaks the ice by sneaking into a secret staff party \u2013 \u201cI carried a watermelon!\u201d (see, awkward) \u2013 Johnny starts to teach her how to dance and slowly mambos his way into her heart. The chemistry between Grey and Swayze is magnetic. She is supremely likable as the naive and opinionated daddy\u2019s girl while Swayze is effortlessly charismatic as the rock star of the holiday resort with his leather jacket and bad-boy attitude.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/09/how-we-made-dirty-dancing-ive-had-the-time-of-my-life\">How we made Dirty Dancing's (I\u2019ve Had) The Time of My Life</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I was pleasantly surprised to be reminded that the film wasn\u2019t just teen fluff. Sure, it has its fair share of saccharine moments but there\u2019s real substance, too. There are subplots involving more serious issues such as abortion and the class conflict that bristles between the hard-up dance crew and the snobbish young waiters from rich families. Baby\u2019s sister Lisa starts dating one of the latter, Robbie, who turns out to be a creep.</p> <p>Something else I\u2019d forgotten is just how feminist it is. Baby is smart, has a strong moral compass and genuinely wants to help other people. She stands up to her disapproving dad, who is angry that she\u2019s been seeing her working-class lover behind his back, with a moving speech about inequality. And Johnny may scoop her out of a corner but it\u2019s Baby who ends up saving him, not the other way round, in a reversal of the well-worn romantic trope. She\u2019s the one who sticks up for him after he\u2019s falsely accused by a jealous ex of stealing someone\u2019s wallet. While he reveals to her in a scene of aching vulnerability that he was the one who was taken advantage of by the rich older women clamouring to seduce him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f720bd063d64615a1b5b0fbbcd07b3a189fb2e3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f720bd063d64615a1b5b0fbbcd07b3a189fb2e3e/167_0_3171_1903/1000.jpg\" alt=\"That lift ...

Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey in Dirty Dancing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Vestron Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But, of course, it all comes back to the dancing. In the final climactic scene, Johnny returns after being fired to make sure he and Baby have their last chance to shine at the resort\u2019s talent show. Cue goosebumps as the first bars of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BQLE_RrTSU&amp;feature=emb_title\">Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes\u2019s iconic theme song</a> come on, and Swayze and Grey take to the stage to dance up a storm, ending with <em>that</em> lift. It\u2019s cheesy but undeniably fun.</p> <p>Not that long ago, I watched the sequel, Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights, because Romola Garai, who plays the lead, is one of my favourite actors (so underrated!). And yes, it\u2019s terrible. But nothing can tarnish my love for the original. Even after all these years, this feelgood classic still has the power to put a big stupid smile on my face. Did I have the time of my life once again? You bet.<br></p>",
  "<p>Thirty-year-old Algerian rapper Soolking was just hitting his stride before the world was put on lockdown. His commercially appealing blend of pop, reggaeton and Algerian ra\u00ef (think Arabic and then add Auto-Tune) has generated a dizzying one billion streams on YouTube, with millions of them generated in the UK; hailing from the small coastal neighbourhood of Staou\u00e9li in Algiers and now living in Paris after time spent there as an undocumented migrant, his story crosses borders and generations.</p> <p>Thankfully, the technology that has helped his music travel also means that I can speak to him while we are in lockdown in our respective countries. Speaking from the sofa in his Paris apartment, he explains what took him to France in 2013. \u201cThe dream was to succeed,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to succeed a bit in music, at least, but I never thought it would be like this.\u201d</p> <p>But Soolking is not just another rapper with big numbers on streaming platforms. His music has come to be a source of pride for a nation who up until just a few weeks ago had been taking to the streets every week to protest since early last year, when Abdelaziz Bouteflika announced his candidacy for a fifth presidential term. Overwhelming public pressure <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/03/abdelaziz-bouteflika-profile-algeria-ailing-leader-190304193802355.html\">forced him to resign</a>, but protests against the regime continued as young people in particular kept pushing for a better quality of life. With two-thirds of Algerians under the age of 30, many have only ever known the country with Bouteflika in charge, and are looking for new voices that can speak to them.</p> <p>Soolking is one of them. One journalist for El Watan, the main newspaper in Algeria went as far as saying \u201cfor young Algerians, he is on a level in terms of image with Riyad Mahrez\u201d, the national football captain and Premier League star.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTAH-AqYm48\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CTAH-AqYm48?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Soolking \u2013 Libert\u00e9 ft Ouled El Bahdja </figcaption> </figure>   <p>Soolking\u2019s song Libert\u00e9 became an unofficial anthem of the protests. \u201cI write because we are the golden generation,\u201d he sings. \u201cFree all those that are taken hostage / That\u2019s all we have, all we have is freedom.\u201d I went to Algeria last year and saw the protests one Friday, where thousands of people flooded the streets, young people passionately belting out the lyrics to this song, waving the Algerian flag: a poignant memory.</p> <p>\u201cIt is nice to see,\u201d he says humbly, though he accepts that the song has been reclaimed by the people. \u201cIt\u2019s not a Soolking song any more. It\u2019s a song for young people, and the original version comes from Ouled El Bahdja, a group which makes music in football stadiums. I wrote the lyrics, re-did the music a bit with them and it has become more than a stadium song \u2013 it has become an international song.\u201d</p> <p>Talking about a song called \u201cFreedom\u201d during a lockdown seems ironic, so I wonder what he thinks the word means at the moment.<strong> \u201c</strong>Freedom is doing what you want, where you want, living where you want, being who you want, being free.\u201d He pauses a moment, before adding: \u201cOf course there are limits. You can\u2019t do bad things. But it is about living the life you want \u2026 I feel free and freedom is priceless.\u201d</p> <p>While lockdown presents limitations and frustrations, especially for an artist who should be out promoting a new album and lining up tour dates, Soolking has already known a lack of freedom, including when he was living in the shadows as an undocumented immigrant: <em>harraga</em>, as we say in Arabic.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do anything without papers,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t travel; if you go in the street and get caught you can get put in jail or they can deport you. But I didn\u2019t feel that too much because I\u2019m a calm person.

That is strength \u2013 misery gives us strength.\u201d</p> <p>That strength is evident in Soolking\u2019s more heartfelt songs, such as Gu\u00e9rilla.

His new album Vintage plays with a similar kind of nostalgia, mixing it with modern sounds.

  "<p>A photograph of a migrant labourer, his face contorted with anguish as he sits on the roadside in Delhi speaking to his wife about their sick baby boy, has come to symbolise the ordeal of India\u2019s daily wage workers; penniless, and unable to get home to their families because of the lockdown.</p> \n<p>Rampukar Pandit, a construction worker in the Indian capital, had heard that his 11-month-old son was seriously unwell. With no public transport to reach his home in Begusarai in Bihar, 1,200 km (745 miles) away, he started walking. He reached Nizamuddin Bridge where, exhausted and hungry, he could go no further.</p> \n<p> Atul Yadav, a photographer with the Press Trust of India, was heading home from work on 11 May when he saw Pandit, 38, sobbing his heart out. Pandit refused his offer of biscuits and water, saying food would \u201cchoke\u201d him because he couldn\u2019t eat while his son was unwell. \u201cHe was so emotional I had to stop shooting. He had been sitting on the road for three days,\u201d said Yadav.</p> \n<p>\u2018We labourers don\u2019t belong to any country,\u201d Pandit told Yadav. \u201cAll I want is to go home and see my son.\u201d</p> \n<p>Later that evening, he reached a nearby police station. He was still waiting for the police to help when a group of well-wishers, having seen Yadav\u2019s tweet about Pandit, arrived in the area and managed to find him at the station.</p> \n<p>By now, he was full of grief. His wife, Bimal Devi, had just called to say their son had died. One of the well-wishers, a woman, paid for and arranged for his train ticket home. \u201cHe wept with gratitude at strangers helping him,\u201d said Yadav.</p> \n<p>Yadav\u2019s photograph illustrates the anguish of millions of migrant labourers in India who are desperate to get home to their families. After waiting in vain for the government to provide them with transport (belatedly some trains are now being laid on for them) they have embarked on astonishing odysseys, from cities all over the country, journeys that have left Indians transfixed and distressed.</p> \n<p>Whether by truck, bicycle, auto-rickshaw or on foot, they have been heading out under their own steam, some making journeys of nearly 1,000 km to reach home. Hunger, thirst, and the scorching heat of the Indian summer are slowing them down. Some have died of exhaustion and sunstroke. Last week a group of 16 who fell asleep on a railway line they had believed was not being used were <a href=\"https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/14-migrant-labourers-crushed-to-death-goods-train-chhattisgarh-aurangabad-maharashtra-1675571-2020-05-08\">killed by a goods train</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf I am to die, I want to die with my parents,\u201d said one young daily wage labourer leaving Indore, a city in Madhya Pradesh.</p> \n<p>An auto-rickshaw driver fleeing Mumbai said: \u201cEven if I starve in the village, I will never come back.

There, he developed a temperature and headaches and was sent to hospital, where he has tested negative for Covid-19.</p> \n<p>On the government\u2019s inaction towards workers separated from their families, Pandit said he was not surprised. \u201cI am a nobody, I\u2019m like an ant, my life doesn\u2019t matter. The government is only concerned with filling the stomachs of the rich,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Pandit cannot wait to reach his home and family. Once there, he plans never to return to Delhi or go to any other city for work, even though he has no land or any other means of support. \u201cHowever I manage, I will manage. My family and my parents will be with me. That\u2019s enough for me,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>If he does ever return to Delhi, though, it will be to meet the woman who paid for his ticket and booked it for him.

  "<p>Further evidence of Malta\u2019s strategy to push migrants back to the conflict zone of Libya has been revealed by a woman who survived a Mediterranean crossing in which 12 people died.</p> <p>A series of voice messages obtained by the Guardian have provided confirmation of the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/world/europe/mediterranean-libya-migrants-europe.html\">Maltese government\u2019s strategy to use private vessels, acting at the behest of its armed forces</a>, in order to intercept migrant crossings and return refugees to Libyan detention centres.</p> <p>The woman said the boat on which she was attempting to reach Europe had been intercepted by a ship enlisted by the Maltese authorities, which took those aboard back to Tripoli.</p> <p>Last month, investigative journalists working for several international media sources exposed the existence of a secret pact between La Valletta and the owners of at least three trawlers.</p> <p>The woman\u2019s account matches that of other survivors who have spoken to <a href=\"https://alarmphone.org/en/\">Alarm Phone</a>, a hotline service for migrants in distress at sea, which first raised the case.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/migration-un-agency-decries-return-of-boat-with-49-people-to-libya\">Migration: UN agency decries return of boat with 49 people to Libya</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Her boat left the coast of Libya on the night of 9 April, she said. Around 63 people, including a six-week-old baby and a two-year-old girl \u2013 most of them from sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 were loaded into a dinghy by traffickers at Garabulli, approximately 50km (31 miles) east of Tripoli.</p> <p>A first ship passed tantalisingly close to them . \u201cThe boat was called Medkon Lines,\u201d said the woman, who showed a photograph of the vessel. \u201cWe tried to stop it to rescue us. Three men jumped in the water to reach it, but in one minute they disappeared in the water.</p> <p>\u201cAfter five days at sea, a Maltese airplane spotted us,\u201d said the woman, whose identity cannot be revealed for her security. \u201cWe thought the plane would call the rescuers, but nobody came. We were feeling so tired and we didn\u2019t even have water or food.\u201d</p> <p>Four other men, almost unconscious from thirst and hunger, let themselves slide down from the dinghy into the water to drown, she said, before, on 14 April, a trawler under a Maltese flag, the Dar Al Salam 1, reached them.</p> <p>\u201cThe crew of the boat told us they were not rescuers \u2026 but said they work for Malta,\u201d the woman said. \u201cThey said they were Egyptian and working at sea for Malta. They were looking at us like we were not human beings.\u201d</p> <p>Last month, investigations by the New York Times and the Italian daily newspaper <a href=\"https://www.avvenire.it/attualita/pagine/controinchiesta-strage-di-pasquetta-libia-malta-scavo\">Avvenire</a> revealed that, with the onset of coronavirus, Malta <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/world/europe/migrants-malta.html\">had allegedly dispatched a small fleet to intercept and return migrants to Libya</a>, citing a senior commander in the Libyan coast guard and a former Maltese official involved. One of the vessels was the Dar Al Salam 1 which oversees international operations for the Libyan coastguard. </p> <p>The owner of the Dar Al Salam 1 is Captain Carmelo Grech. Asked for comment by the Guardian, Grech replied by sending an angry-face emoticon.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.avvenire.it/attualita/pagine/malta-svelato-il-nome-del-barcone-fantasma-e-frontex-accusa-gli-stati-li-abbiamo-informati-ma-soccorsi-spettano-a-loro\">The Dar Al Salam 1 sails with two other vessels</a>, the Salve Regina and the Tremar, all allegedly hired by Malta.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4135e4e98c6457ea7f1e7217e38c38e971eb1221\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4135e4e98c6457ea7f1e7217e38c38e971eb1221/0_0_360_780/231.jpg\" alt=\"A photograph taken aboard the dingy that was allegedly pushed back by Malta to Libya.\" width=\"231\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A photograph taken aboard the dingy that was allegedly pushed back by Malta to Libya.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The woman\u2019s account was of three boats. She said two migrants died during the interception, and that three others died en route to Libya.</p> <p>\u201cOnce we were aboard the boat, we begged them to not bring us back to Libya. But then they placed us in the stern of the ship and locked themselves in the boat kitchen. They left us inside with four bottles of water. We knocked but they didn\u2019t open. We started to cry and think that they had just lied to us.\u201d</p> <p>After 48 hours, the migrants\u2019 worst fears were confirmed when the ship arrived in Tripoli. Passengers were moved to the detention centre of Tariq al-Sikka \u2013 infamous for torture and abuse \u2013 where they remain.</p> <p>\u201cMaltese authorities\u2019 refusal to rescue these persons amount to a serious breach of international human rights and maritime law,\u2019\u2019 said Giulia Tranchina, human rights lawyer at Wilson Solicitors in London. \u201cThe survivors taken back to Libya have been placed again in arbitrary detention in inhuman conditions in the main EU-funded \u2018official detention centre\u2019 of Tariq Al Sikka, managed by the Libyan [Directorate for Illegal Migration] police, where male refugees are often tortured in underground cells for months.\u2019\u2019</p> <p>Following April\u2019s media coverage, prosecutors in Malta launched an investigation into the allegations. Neville Gaf\u00e0, a former Maltese official, told magistrates on 30 April <a href=\"https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/neville-gafa-says-he-coordinated-libya-pushback-on-opm-orders.788951\">he was enlisted by the government to coordinate the pushback of migrants to Libya,</a> following instructions from the prime minister\u2019s office.</p> <p>The Maltese government did not respond to Guardian requests for comment. However, in a statement released on 15 April, authorities in La Valletta confirmed that it \u201ccoordinated the rescue of an immigrant boat assisted by a commercial vessel\u201d and on 1 May, answering reporters\u2019 questions about the boats, Malta\u2019s prime minister, Robert Abela, said: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/05/01/world/europe/ap-eu-malta-migrants.html\">Nothing stops a state from using private assets.</a>\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for Alarm Phone said: \u201cTwelve people have died while Malta and Europe were watching. We should never forget that these deaths are the direct result of Malta\u2019s and Europe\u2019s non-assistance policies, and their clear intention to let people die at sea. These deaths could and should have been prevented.\u2019\u2019</p> <p>The survivors are all still in detention cells, including the toddler and baby, at Tripoli\u2019s Tariq al-Sikka, where, according to lawyers and charities, they have no access to medical treatment, or sufficient food and water.</p> <p>\u2018\u2019We wanted to come to Europe because we have the right to live\u2019\u2019 says the woman. \u2018\u2019I have decided to talk because it is my right to talk, because our brothers died in the sea. It is my right to talk about what I saw.\u201d </p>"
