  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Trump continues to push theory that virus came from lab</h2> <p>\u201cSomething happened,\u201d the US president told reporters in the Oval Office when asked about the theory that the coronavirus was released from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.</p> <p>\u201cProbably it was incompetence. Somebody was stupid,\u201d he added during a meeting with the Texas governor.</p> <p>It comes after US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, claimed he had seen \u201cenormous evidence\u201d that the virus had originated at the lab. No evidence has been produced. China<strong> </strong>has denied the claims.</p> <h2>Global death toll nears 270,000</h2> <p>The total number of coronavirus deaths across the world has reached 268,999, according to <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">Johns Hopkins University</a>, which has tracked the spread of the virus during the pandemic.</p> <p>The US death toll from coronavirus has now <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">surpassed 75,000 people</a>, the highest globally, followed by the UK with 30,689 deaths.</p> <p>The countries with the next highest numbers of deaths are Italy with 29,958 and Spain with 26,070.</p> <h2><strong>White House reportedly shelved guidance on reopening businesses</strong></h2> <p>A report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was shelved by the White House, according to AP News.</p> <p>The document includes step-by-step guidance on how and when local authorities should allow businesses to reopen and life to resume as normal.</p> <p>The 17-page report was scheduled to be published on Friday but now the guidance \u201cwill never see the light of day\u201d, a CDC official told AP.</p> <p>It urges businesses to slowly reopen while continuing to observe social distancing. Trump has pushed for a rapid reopening despite fears of a surge in coronavirus cases.</p> <h2>Concerns over UK contact-tracing app</h2> <p>The UK\u2019s contact-tracing app<strong> </strong>must not be rolled out until the government has increased privacy and data protections, a parliamentary committee has said, as rights groups warn that the current trial is unlawful under the Data Protection Act.</p> <p>The joint committee on human rights said it was essential legislation was enacted to ensure the mass surveillance of personal data did not result in a violation before the trial was expanded.</p> <p>The app, which is being trialled on the Isle of Wight, logs users\u2019 movements and can alert people if they have had contact with someone who has developed symptoms.</p> <h2>Madrid health director resigns as region seeks to lift lockdown</h2> <p>The director of public health for the Madrid region, Yolanda Fuentes, has resigned, apparently in protest at the regional government\u2019s decision to seek to loosen lockdown restrictions in the area of Spain hardest hit by coronavirus.</p> <p>Fuentes stepped down as the Madrid regional government prepares to seek permission from the national health ministry to reopen small businesses, with restaurant and bar terraces opening at 30% capacity.</p> <p>Fuentes is understood to have had grave reservations about the move, as Madrid remains badly affected by the virus.</p> <h2>France\u2019s daily death total falls</h2> <p>France reported 178 new coronavirus deaths, a fall from 278 the previous day, and saw its number of patients in intensive care drop under 3,000 for the first time since late March.</p> <p>The health ministry said 25,987 people were now confirmed to have died from the virus in hospitals and nursing homes.</p> <h2>France reveals easing of lockdown measures</h2> <p>The French prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, said the country\u2019s<strong> </strong>border will remain closed for the \u201cforeseeable future\u201d except for absolutely essential professional or family reasons and trans-border workers, and they will still need to carry an international declaration.</p> <p>Although restrictions will be eased in some areas, in the capital and the four adjoining regions \u2013 Ile-de-France, Hauts-de-France, Grand Est Bourgogne-Franche-Comte \u2013 which comprise the \u201cred zone\u201d, public parks and gardens will remain shut.</p> <p>Anyone stopped by police or gendarmes making a journey of more than 100km will need a new sworn declaration stating the journey is absolutely essential.</p> <h2><strong>Brazil records further 610 deaths</strong></h2> <p>Brazil<strong> </strong>registers 9,888 new cases of coronavirus and 610 deaths on Thursday, the country\u2019s health ministry said. That brought the total to 135,106 confirmed cases in Brazil, with 9,146 deaths from Covid-19.</p> <h2>WHO study: 190,000 people in Africa could die from virus</h2> <p>Up to 190,000 people in Africa could die of Covid-19 during the first year of the pandemic if containment measures fail, according to a study by the World Health Organization.</p> <p>Algeria, South Africa and Cameroon are among the countries at high risk if containment measures are not prioritised, the study found.</p> <p>It also warned that health services would be overwhelmed with the number of people requiring treatment and recommends that hospitals increase their capacity.</p> <h2>Turkey records 57 further deaths</h2> <p>The number of people who have died from Covid-19 in Turkey has risen by 57 in the last 24-hours to 3,641, Health Ministry data showed.</p> <p>The overall number of cases rose by 1,977 to 133,721, the highest total outside western Europe, the US and Russia.</p> <h2>Australian cabinet set to ease restrictions in stages</h2> <p>Australia\u2019s national cabinet is expected to ease some social distancing restrictions on Friday as the number of new coronavirus infections slows.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s minister for health, Greg Hunt, said he expected the cabinet to detail a timetable for easing those restrictions.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I expect is a clear roadmap out, with clear stages,\u201d Hunt told reporters.</p>",

The government moved to manage expectations about how far restrictions would be loosened next week, stressing it would exercise \u201cmaximum caution\u201d with easing any measures. There is rising tension between the UK and devolved governments, with the prime minister yet to share details of his lockdown plan with the first ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, prompting devolved leaders to make pre-emptive announcements of their own (more below). The government also, unusually, did not formally extend the lockdown as required by law today.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Black men and women are four times more likely to die after contracting Covid-19 than white people,</strong> research from the ONS revealed. After taking into account age, measures of self-reported health and disability and other socio-demographic characteristics, black people were still 1.9 times more likely to die with coronavirus than their white counterparts. People of Bangladeshi and Pakistani, Indian, and mixed ethnicities are also significantly more likely to die. Social factors including living in overcrowded, multifamily or intergenerational households, relative deprivation, and working in public-facing occupations may help explain why this is the case for BAME people, but there is much to still be explained, the ONS report said.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Unemployment could double and the economy could shrink by 14%</strong> as the coronavirus causes the deepest recession in modern history, the Bank of England forecast. In a warning over the mounting damage to the economy since the onset of the pandemic and the lockdown measures to contain it, the Bank said GDP could plunge by 25% in the second quarter. It could take a year for the economy to return to normal and there were risks of long-term damage, it added.</li> \n   <li><strong>Scotland\u2019s strict lockdown regulations \u201cmust be extended\u201d but Nicola Sturgeon will consider allowing outdoor exercise more than once a day </strong>if the scientific evidence permits, the Scottish government said. The first minister said she saw no case for relaxing the lockdown because the transmission rate was still too high.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>The Welsh government said schools in Wales would not reopen on 1 June</strong>, regardless of what happens in England.</li> \n   <li><strong>Airports owned by MAG are to require passengers to cover faces and wear gloves and temperature screening trials are to begin in the coming weeks</strong>. The firm, which owns Manchester, Stansted and East Midlands airports, said people needed to be able to travel safely when the time is right. It followed a similar announcement from Heathrow yesterday.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s it from us on the UK side.

But he said Boris Johnson would set out a \u201croadmap\u201d for the way forward on Sunday, containing \u201cappropriate measures to be taken at appropriate milestones, subject to very clear conditions\u201d. He went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There will be detailed guidance to help inform, advise and reassure the public, businesses and other organisations. To get this right, we have set milestones. Some changes can confidently be introduced more quickly than others and some of those other ones will take longer to introduce.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Raab downplayed suggestions any early changes would be far-reaching.

He said two weeks ago he would have given a different figure, between 0.6 and 0.8.</p> \n  <p>He said this was because the nature of the spread had changed.

secondly, your probability of dying once you have been infected.</p> \n   <p>Now those two things are influenced by your personal circumstances to a large degree, so the first thing we did is, we looked at adjusting for age, what the difference was of dying to these ethnic groups and that brought out some quite stark differences.</p> \n   <p>So just adjusting for age, we saw that the black ethnic grouping was just over four times more likely to die of Covid-related issues than the white group, the Bangladeshi and Pakistani grouping was about 3.5 times more likely and the Indian grouping about 2.5 times more likely.</p> \n   <p>Those figures are just when we adjust for age, but we know other circumstances matter, so we want to try and introduce those other circumstances, which we can do, because we have geographical location from the death certificate and the death registration.</p> \n   <p>So we know for example, big cities like London, Birmingham and Manchester have been more affected, we know from figures that we released last Friday that whether you\u2019re in an urban or rural area matters, your area\u2019s relative level of deprivation matters, so there\u2019s really a strong social gradient to mortality rates generally, and even more for Covid.</p> \n   <p>So we needed to adjust for those other factors as well, so geography is a key one and then other socio-economic factors, we could get data from the census records that we\u2019ve linked the deaths to, so things like people\u2019s qualifications, people\u2019s housing circumstances, what type of jobs or occupations they had and their self-reported health.</p> \n   <p>When we adjust for all those other things, then actually those rates come down significantly, a lot of the difference can be explained by these geographical and socio-economic factors.</p> \n   <p>Once we\u2019ve adjusted for that, the black ethnic group is now about 90% or 1.9 times more likely to die from Covid-related issues, Bangladeshi and Pakistani males are about 80% more likely, females about 60% more likely and Indian females are about 40% more likely and males about 30% more likely.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n

It\u2019s still humid under the lights. The score is 1-1, the players wide-eyed but still running.</p> <p>A World Cup that began a month ago in Munich is entering the final moments of overtime. Marco Materazzi puts his hand on Zinedine Zidane\u2019s back, seeming to guide him quite gently out of the way. Zidane turns, says something and walks away. He has two minutes and 10 seconds left of his career as a footballer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/26/world-cup-questions-were-england-robbed-by-argentina-at-mexico-86\">World Cup questions: Were England robbed by Argentina at Mexico 86? | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Everyone knows what happens next. Zidane\u2019s red card is one of the much-storied moments of modern football. We remember it as the decisive turn in a World Cup final; as a discordant endnote to a great career; and its aftermath as a wider narrative of loyalties, brands, attitudes, even personal politics.</p> <p>So many strands to that one moment. And yet it remains an oddly opaque incident. Watching the whole two hours and 40 minutes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/jul/10/worldcup2006.match1\" title=\"\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/jul/10/worldcup2006.match1\" title=\"\">2006 final</a> back on Fifa\u2019s media channel, with the added certainty of knowing not just how this ends, but how it feels 14 years later, it is still hard to see any clarity. A bad decision. A moment of violence in the glare of lights and noise. A mute exit.</p> <p>It was always part of Zidane\u2019s appeal that he remained to some degree an outsider superstar even in his pomp years. Zidane turned 24 while playing (unremarkably) for France at Euro 96. He\u2019d spent six seasons in Ligue 1, brilliant but brittle, by the time Juventus took a gamble on this silhouette of a football genius.</p> <p>Italy made Zidane. The fitness, the tactical discipline and the influence of Marcello Lippi pushed him right out into the far reaches of his own talent. Sport loves an easy narrative arc. In Berlin it seemed fitting that his final game as a footballer should come with Lippi on the touchline, on a night when Zidane\u2019s expressive, balletic brilliance was matched against a team of definitive Italian defensive resilience.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73f11507277df0bef0c4bde6b2356fd766cc9eb7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73f11507277df0bef0c4bde6b2356fd766cc9eb7/0_0_3245_2196/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Italy coach, Marcello Lippi, looks on as the French players celebrate Zidane\u2019s goal in the final.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"677\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Italy coach, Marcello Lippi, looks on as the French players celebrate Zidane\u2019s goal in the final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Was this a moment of hubris? Of downfall and fatal flaws? Was Zidane exposed in Berlin? Or ennobled? At times in sport there is a feeling the drive for meaning comes from a kind of desperation. Let\u2019s face it, there really are a lot of people watching here. This has to mean something.</p> <p>Two things stand out now. First, Italy always seemed to be winning this World Cup final from about 20 minutes into the game. France played like a team with an air of destiny around it; without actually, it turns out, having an air of destiny. Zidane\u2019s sending off was not material to the drift of this game, to its sense of natural justice. The red card deprived France of a first-choice penalty taker \u2013 but correctly so. It also deprived Italy of the chance to win the World Cup final without an asterisk.</p> <p>And secondly Zidane looks wired from the start. The Fifa film is a high-resolution number. As the teams walk out the camera pans to show the wonderful sweep of the stadium, crammed with conflicting shades of blue. These are two of the great national anthems, accompanied by a camera-pan down a thrilling row of row faces.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b37f92f36bd7fb105e3736c1e97057eed5578f29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b37f92f36bd7fb105e3736c1e97057eed5578f29/0_0_2688_1898/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Patrick Vieira, Thierry Henry and Franck Rib\u00e9ry listen to the national anthems before the final.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"706\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patrick Vieira, Thierry Henry and Franck Rib\u00e9ry listen to the national anthems before the final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Platiau/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What a team France had. Patrick Vieira stands with eyes closed, an arm around Thierry Henry, who has an arm around a 23-year-old Franck Rib\u00e9ry. Zidane is at the end of the line, the star of this show already. He was brilliant in the quarter-final against Brazil. In closeup he even looks like the World Cup, that huge sleek rounded skull filling the screen. Even when you know the end note here, the empty clang of forehead into chest, the sense of glory in waiting feels inevitable. <em>Marchons, marchons</em>.</p> <p>The pitch is cut in beautiful wide green stripes. Even the people in the stands seem to gleam with youth and wealth. This really was the most prosperous of modern-day World Cups, a World Cup drenched in Euro boom times, in Germany\u2019s success, in the age of Wags and headline-grabbing haircuts, a cult of celebrity that still felt oddly innocent.</p> <p>Zidane\u2019s first touch is a dinked outside-of-the-foot pass to the left. Seconds later Henry is knocked almost out cold in a collision with Fabio Cannavaro\u2019s shoulder. Smelling salts are produced. With four minutes gone Gianluca Zambrotta is booked for hacking down Vieira as he glides away with the ball. Italy aren\u2019t mucking about.</p> <p>But they\u2019re soon behind. Henry heads the ball inside from the touchline and suddenly Florent Malouda is haring in on goal. Materazzi goes to tackle, then pulls his leg away. Cannavaro stays close but resists making contact. Malouda falls over. It\u2019s a pretty soft penalty kick.</p> <p>Zidane takes the kick. And of course it\u2019s ridiculous. A Panenka penalty in the seventh minute of the World Cup final against one of the best goalkeepers ever to play the game. Who does this?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"30470526e1e8fbc6fae9967fd752029be98374f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30470526e1e8fbc6fae9967fd752029be98374f4/0_0_2055_1405/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zidane scores with a Panenka penalty.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"684\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zidane scores with a Panenka penalty.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Potts/PA Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s also a poor Panenka, floating on to the bar then bouncing down and just over the line. It\u2019s a goal. But it feels like an embarrassment to the occasion, the act of someone not entirely in control.</p> <p>In the stands Jacques Chirac bounces and yelps. France have held on to a 1-0 lead in their last two games. Italy have now conceded their first goal scored by an actual opponent in this tournament \u2013 the only other was Cristian Zaccardo\u2019s own-goal in the group-stage draw against the USA. But they soon start to press back.</p> <p>What have Italy got here? For a start they have Mauro Camoranesi, who wouldn\u2019t get anywhere near the French team, who is a stubby little scuttling pest of a midfielder, but who doesn\u2019t give a damn about any of this, or about the occasion, and just keeps on snapping around Zidane.</p> <p>They have Andrea Pirlo, a sublime talent too, and seemingly always able to execute those skills in these huge games. Pirlo looks calm, buzzing up and down the left, twisting about chipping intricate little passes, asserting his own rhythms. It\u2019s his corner that makes the equaliser, a precise delivery on to the head of Materazzi, who leaps above Vieira and batters the ball past Fabien Barthez, his forehead striking the leather like a fist.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"229a8b1866625a53618ad311f748da688c9808f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/229a8b1866625a53618ad311f748da688c9808f7/0_0_3000_1966/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marco Materazzi heads the ball past Fabien Barthez for the equaliser.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"655\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marco Materazzi heads the ball past Fabien Barthez for the equaliser.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The score is 1-1. Italy are just about in charge now. Fabio Grosso gallops down the left and punts a cross over the bar. Grosso isn\u2019t a great left-back. But he had a great World Cup. This is what Italy do, a way of playing that ennobles and vindicates every other team\u2019s victories. You want this? You want your moment in time? Fine. But you\u2019ve got to come through us to get there.</p> <p>Henry has recovered by now. He runs past Francesco Totti and slides Rib\u00e9ry in on the right. He fends off Gennaro Gattuso with a regal dip of the shoulder. Mention is sometimes made of the fact Henry played in nine cup finals and scored zero goals. A few months earlier he left the pitch raging in Paris <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/may/18/match.championsleague\" title=\"\">after defeat by Barcelona in the Champions League final</a>. There is no significance to this. Henry is an extraordinary footballer and a leader too, driving to the left and setting up the pattern of France\u2019s attacks, with the wide players surging inside and Zidane playing very high at times as a genuine No 10.</p> <p>Italy\u2019s success in this game lies in the way they interrupt this flow. Every time Zidane gets the ball within 40 metres of goal Gattuso charges into his space. Zidane can have the ball in the centre circle. Anywhere else: compress, bite, bring him down. When they have the ball Italy play diagonal long passes to Luca Toni. The plan is clear. Shut Zidane down. Keep possession. Get behind the French full-backs.</p> <p>With 35 minutes gone Toni heads Pirlo\u2019s cross against the bar. Moments later Zidane turns and starts to dribble but Materazzi comes sprinting out and performs an astonishing tackle, taking he ball at full stretch with a deep booming thunk. Zidane gets up. No complaints. But Italy are dominating as half-time arrives.</p> <p>The second half is gripping. Malouda should have another penalty in the 53rd minute after he\u2019s bundled down by Zambrotta. Vieira goes off injured. Toni heads a deep free-kick past Barthez from the edge of the box with thrilling power, but he\u2019s offside.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6e2e8c943defa5283bf7c7991fabd73e117f7a57\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e2e8c943defa5283bf7c7991fabd73e117f7a57/0_0_1884_2200/856.jpg\" alt=\"Zidane reacts after his header was saved by Gianluigi Buffon.\" width=\"856\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zidane reacts after his header was saved by Gianluigi Buffon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Gentile/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the game enters the final 10 minutes of normal time Italy are playing through a kind of triumphant rage, defending furiously, keeping the ball, passing it backwards to cheers from their support. Zidane has injured his shoulder. He has it sprayed and wanders back on. He\u2019s still running hard, even if by now his goal feels like it happened in another life.</p> <p>Even the break before extra time seems telling. Lippi is pointing and yelling and bollocking his players. Raymond Domenech takes Zidane to one side and speaks to him quietly. Zidane listens then walks away. Fair enough. What exactly, are you going to tell him here anyway?</p> <p>Rib\u00e9ry finds space and has a shot at goal. David Trezeguet, scorer of the winner against Italy in the final of Euro 2000, replaces him. Zidane does something brilliant, jinking away from the blue press, then haring into the middle to head Willy Sagnol\u2019s cross. Buffon palms it over. Zidane screams. And then it happens.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/13/world-cup-questions-why-didnt-the-great-dutch-teams-of-the-1990s-win-it\">World Cup questions: Why didn\u2019t the great Dutch teams of the 1990s win it? | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are 12 minutes left of extra time.

Zidane turns, thinks about it. The incident is passing. It\u2019s almost gone. But not quite. Zidane comes closer.</p> <p>It looks like an excellent butt from a technical point of view: shoulders swivelling, neck wrenched, forehead rammed into the breast bone. It\u2019s not exactly \u201cshockingly violent\u201d, as the commentator suggests (Materazzi just gets up); more shockingly weird and out of place.</p> <p>Play continues. But this is too big to pass. It\u2019s a footballing Chernobyl. It can\u2019t be glossed or hushed. The reactor core is open. And the fallout is already starting. Italian players are pointing and haranguing the referee. There are animated conversations, figures scuttling across the pitch.</p> <p>It takes two minutes of earpiece-clutching for a response to come. Zidane is sent off. He puts a hand on the referee\u2019s shoulder, says something, then walks away. On the touchline Domenech performs furious sarcastic applause. Zidane ambles past the trophy. And that is pretty much that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cee88dbfcc752316bcef82e08a708e07da26c734\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cee88dbfcc752316bcef82e08a708e07da26c734/0_0_2800_2661/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zidane removes the captain\u2019s armband after receiving the red card from the referee, Horacio Elizondo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"950\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zidane removes the captain\u2019s armband after receiving the red card from the referee, Horacio Elizondo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Val\u00e9ry Hache/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are still two main mysteries here. First, why did he do it? Zidane suggested afterwards that his mother had been insulted. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/feb/06/marco-materazzi-zinedine-zidane-the-sun-libel\" title=\"\">Some English newspapers</a> even ran a story that Materazzi had called his mother \u201ca terrorist whore\u201d, apparently based on lip reading experts, but then had to apologise, retract and pay libel damages when Materazzi denied it.</p> <p>\u201cMy mother died when I was 15. I would never have insulted his,\u201d Materazzi has said. \u201cI spoke about his sister instead.\u201d Ah. That\u2019s OK then. Endless Warren Report-style analysis seems to have concluded Materazzi said: \u201cYou can give it [his shirt] to your sister\u201d or something close.</p> <p>Is it enough? Does any part of this add up? There has been so much noise, so much temptation to portray Zidane as either a fatally-flawed hero, a defender of personal rights, a human agent in a world of athletic units. Really, though, the main feeling is one of crushing mundanity, of mild absurdity even. Is this really it?</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2014/may/26/zidane-headbutt-materazzi-brick-by-brick-world-cup\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/3pfvd\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2097346\"            data-video-name=\"Zinedine Zidane headbutts Marco Materazzi: brick-by-brick World Cup reconstruction \u2013 video animation\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/5/22/1400770255324/Brick-by-Brick-reconstruc-010.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-437559330\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/5/22/1400770255324/Brick-by-Brick-reconstruc-010.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/05/22/140526BbBzidane2006-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/05/22/140526BbBzidane2006/140526BbBzidane2006.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/05/22/140526BbBzidane2006.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/05/22/140526BbBzidane2006_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/05/22/140526BbBzidane2006_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2014/may/26/zidane-headbutt-materazzi-brick-by-brick-world-cup\">Zinedine Zidane head-butts Marco Materazzi: brick-by-brick World Cup reconstruction</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The second mystery surrounds the call to send him off. Lippi suggested initially help had come from a Fifa official with a TV monitor. This would have been a breach of protocol. The Fifa line is that the fourth official, Luis Medina Cantalejo of Spain, saw the butt in real time and told referee Horacio Elizondo through his head set.</p> <p>The referee has even given <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaZUyGN3vGk\" title=\"\">a TED talk</a> on this subject. Apparently Cantalejo told him: \u201cDreadful, Zidane\u2019s head-butt on Materazzi was dreadful \u2026 Fuck! Zidane head-butted Materazzi. When you see the video you will not believe me.\u201d Cantalejo mentions video here, unnecessarily. Conspiracy fans will perhaps wonder why.</p> <p>Does it matter? This was entirely the right decision. Although, it also feels a little odd even now. Football changed in that instant: a moment of progress, but also of intrusion, a moment when professional sport edged closer to becoming an arm of our shared 24-hour digital surveillance.</p> <p>To follow high-level football now is to experience an endless loop, an endless argument about details. Some see this as a triumph, progress towards the elimination of error and perfectibility. This is perhaps the case. But it also forgets the elements of play, of muddle, of intrigue that distinguish \u201csport\u201d (look up that word) from data, from a line of numbers, from a courtroom transcript, from drudgery, from an absence of human mess and human muddle.</p> <p>So to penalties. Pirlo hoists the opening kick in the roof of the net, a kick so decisive you know at this moment Italy are going to win. Materazzi takes one, of course, and scores easily. In fact everyone scores except Trezeguet, who smashes his with pointless power against the crossbar. The ball bounces down and out, a mocking echo of that Panenka. \u201cThe BIGGEST SIX INCHES in French football HISTORY,\u201d the Fifa commentator says, admiringly.</p> <p>Italy just keep slotting them. Alessandro Del Piero never looks like missing through every one of the 50 steps it takes to get to the spot. Grosso puts one in the corner. And that is it. The blue shirts come haring on, leaping and jumping, eyes wide, spooked by their own moment of history.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"433da516fa60767a149f10a3574670669394c42c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/433da516fa60767a149f10a3574670669394c42c/0_0_2987_2047/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Italy\u2019s Fabio Grosso celebrates after scoring the match-winning penalty.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"685\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Italy\u2019s Fabio Grosso celebrates after scoring the match-winning penalty.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Platiau/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In France there was an instant urge to find some kind of meaning in Zidane\u2019s headbutt, not just as a reason for defeat, but as some wider cultural force. \u201cZizou On T\u2019aime\u201d was scrawled across the Arc de Triomphe. Chirac would announce his love and admiration for Zidane (who lost his temper and butted someone) in a speech on the team\u2019s return. The butt was made into a sculpture (\u201cCoup De Tete\u201d) and displayed at the Centre Pompidou.</p> <p>Some of his teammates were less than pleased. Sagnol didn\u2019t speak to Zidane for two years. And for that team this was a moment when something passed. A World Cup win would have been France\u2019s third major trophy in eight years, a run to enshrine that team with the true greats.</p> <p>Half of the class in 2006 had been there for the whole span. In the event that brilliant generation is left with a home World Cup, a Euros in the country next door, the implosion in South Korea and defeat to Greece at Euro 2004: a fine champion team but not quite an all-time great one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Zidane\u2019s sending off brought a feeling of entropy, but also of absurdity, an act pulled out from all that heat and light that seems to mean less the more you look at it.</p> <p>It seems significant that Zidane himself has never appeared to be tortured, or aggrieved, or even that bothered by his final moment as a footballer. What does seem certain is that Italy\u2019s win reasserted in its own way the value of the team in an age in individualism. And that they were, all white noise aside, entirely deserved winners.</p>",
  "<p>A universal experience is highlighting the sharp divides in our society. Few are as stark and shocking as those revealed by Thursday\u2019s news that black people in England and Wales are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/black-people-four-times-more-likely-to-die-from-covid-19-ons-finds\" title=\"\">more than four times as likely to die</a> from Covid-19 as white people. Bangladeshi and Pakistani people were about three and a half times more likely, and those of Indian origin two and a half times as likely, the Office for National Statistics reported.</p> <p>The disproportionately high toll of BAME people was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/british-bame-covid-19-death-rate-more-than-twice-that-of-whites\" title=\"\">already evident</a>, notably among medical staff: a <a href=\"https://www.hsj.co.uk/exclusive-deaths-of-nhs-staff-from-covid-19-analysed/7027471.article\" title=\"\">review</a> of just over a hundred NHS staff who died found that almost two-thirds were black or Asian, though those groups account for less than one in seven workers in the health service. It is all the more striking, given that age is one of the biggest risk factors and the over-65s comprise only one in 20 of the BAME population, compared with almost one in five of the white population.</p> <p>The reasons are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/why-are-people-from-bame-groups-dying-disproportionately-of-covid-19\" title=\"\">complex, interlocking</a> and not yet fully understood. Geography has doubtless played its part; urban dwellers have been worse hit. The prevalence of underlying conditions such as diabetes vary markedly between communities. But health is intimately tied to economic wellbeing. It cannot be divorced from other considerations. We know that, in general, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/25/the-guardian-view-on-inequality-and-health-a-matter-of-life-and-death\" title=\"\">the poor die younger</a>. Black, Bangladeshi and Pakistani populations face higher levels of unemployment and child poverty than white groups, and are much more likely to live in overcrowded conditions.</p> <p>Even stripping out such factors, the ONS figures show black people are still almost twice as likely as white people to die a Covid-19-related death, with Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian individuals also disproportionately affected.</p> <p>Cultural factors may play a part; multigenerational occupancy may put older people at greater risk. But there are also difficult questions to be asked, such as whether BAME people enjoy equal access to healthcare and are treated in the same way. The head of the British Medical Association has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/10/uk-coronavirus-deaths-bame-doctors-bma\" title=\"\">wondered</a> whether BAME doctors might feel less able to complain about inadequate personal protective equipment, noting that they are more likely to report feeling bullied and harassed than their white counterparts, and much less likely to raise concerns for fear of the consequences. Many of those have been born outside the UK, and the BMA has rightly urged that they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/03/calls-grow-scrap-nhs-surcharge-migrant-healthcare-workers-coronavirus\" title=\"\">should be exempted from the migrant surcharge</a> for the NHS. It is absurd and unjust that those risking their lives for others should be forced to pay for healthcare themselves.</p> <p>Whether more can be done to protect them must be assessed urgently. A rapid review is needed into the high death rates of BAME people, and those working in the health service especially, to protect lives. Public Health England\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/phe-to-review-how-ethnicity-affects-vulnerability-to-coronavirus\" title=\"\">review</a> of health records, which aims to better understand how factors such as ethnicity, deprivation, age, gender and obesity could affect the impact of coronavirus on people, is due to report back at the end of the month. Yet quite how far it will delve into these questions is still unclear, and the involvement of a firm co-founded by Trevor Phillips, former head of the equalities watchdog, has been widely criticised.</p> <p>In the longer run, there are no quick solutions to our society\u2019s health inequalities. They are deeply rooted, have entrenched themselves in the austerity years, and will not easily be eradicated. The pandemic has exposed how devastating they can be, and when it ends, the need to address them will be as deep as ever.</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/gas-leak-at-chemical-factory-in-india-kills-hospitalises-lg-polymers\">The gas leak at a chemical factory</a> in Visakhapatnam will immediately remind many in India and beyond of the 1984 Bhopal disaster, widely considered the world\u2019s worst industrial disaster.</p> <p>So far, the scale of the tragedies are very different. Eleven people are confirmed to have died in Visakhapatnam \u2013 but with hundreds hospitalised and thousands affected, there are fears the toll will rise. In Bhopal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/04/bhopal-25-years-indra-sinha\"> 4,000 people died within days</a> of the toxic gas leak from a pesticide plant in the central Indian city, and thousands more in the following years.</p> <p>But there are also startling parallels. The leak in Visakhapatnam, an industrial port city in Andhra Pradesh state on India\u2019s east coast, was from two 5,000-tonne tanks of liquid chemicals. According to a local police officer, it occurred as the plant was being restarted as coronavirus restrictions imposed in late March were eased.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/india-gasleakmap/giv-3902j4zy6FuTpYT4\" data-alt=\"India gas leak map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/india-gasleakmap/giv-3902j4zy6FuTpYT4\">India gas leak map</a> </figure>  <p>In Bhopal, a much bigger leak occurred, also from a tank full of chemical liquid \u2013 extremely hazardous methyl isocyanate \u2013 as parts of the complex were reactivated after a shutdown.</p> <p>In both cases, the leak occurred at night, releasing gas into the crowded homes of workers and their families living around the factories. And both plants had overseas owners: South Korea\u2019s biggest petrochemical maker, LG Chem, in the case of Visakhapatnam, and US-based Union Carbide the majority owner in the case of Bhopal.</p> <p>Both incidents are only the most high-profile of thousands, big and small, that happen every year in India.</p> <p>Quite how many industrial accidents occur in India annually is unknown, as many go unreported. Government statistics \u2013 which show <a href=\"https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/3-workers-die-47-are-injured-every-day-in-factory-accidents/article26378544.ece\">54,000 killed or injured in factory accidents between 2014 and 2016 </a>\u2013 are thought to only represent a fraction of all casualties. Campaigners claim the true figure is <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/48000-die-due-to-occupational-accidents-yearly-study/articleshow/61725283.cms\">up to 15 times greater</a>.</p> <p>One problem is that few workers or their relatives are aware of their rights or have the resources to seek legal redress. Many are migrant workers from distant rural communities, a higher proportion are women, a significant number come from the most disadvantaged communities, and so are vulnerable to physical or other threats. Employers often pay compensation privately to ensure a bereaved family\u2019s silence.</p> <p>Though a profusion of laws exist to protect workers in India, few are enforced. Inspections are rare, and some officials are easily compromised. Last year a fire caused by a short circuit killed 43 people and injured 60 in a workshop in Delhi. The building <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/anaj-mandi-factory-fire-4-owners-are-prime-accused/articleshow/74701095.cms\">had been repeatedly inspected by local officials</a> but no alarms were raised despite its evidently poor condition. Police said they would investigate alleged corruption.</p> <p>Similarly, owners often escape sanction. The criminal justice system in India is slow, and scarce police resources are unlikely to be focused on the investigation of industrial accidents. Local political rivalries, or tensions between state-level and national-level governments can also complicate the search for justice. Pursuing multinationals or foreign owners is expensive, complicated, time-consuming and fraught with uncertainty.</p> <p>In the case of Bhopal, the then chairman of the company, a US citizen, refused to return to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/india\">India</a> to face charges, and Union Carbide paid only $470m (\u00a3282m) in 1989 to the Indian government in an out-of-court settlement. In 2010 a court <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/10267196\">sentenced eight Indians to two years in jail</a>. </p> <p>Finally, there is the profound problem of political will. Campaigners point to the example of traffic accidents. There are between 150,000 and 300,000 road deaths a year in India. Most of the casualties are poor people, with pedestrians and cyclists prominent among victims.

  "<p>The Home Office took part in a pandemic contingency exercise at an immigration removal centre as early as January, it has emerged, prompting questions about how much the government knew about the forecast scale of the Covid-19 outbreak.</p> \n<p>Sarah Burnett, the business operations director for justice and immigration at Serco, told MPs that the exercise took place at the Yarl\u2019s Wood immigration centre with the involvement of the Home Office and Northamptonshire healthcare trust.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Addressing the home affairs select committee, Burnett said the exercise allowed those involved to ensure they had sufficient stocks of personal protection equipment (PPE).</p> \n<p>Colin Dobell, the managing director at Mitie Care &amp; Custody, similarly told the committee that a pandemic contingency exercise took place with the Home Office at the Heathrow immigration removal centre (IRC) in February, allowing it to start reducing the numbers in detention in early March.</p> \n<p>The Labour MP Stephen Doughty asked the pair if they were surprised that the formal imposition of lockdown conditions did not happen until 23 March.</p> \n<p>Dobell replied: \u201cWe were communicating with Home Office all the way through it. It was clear from late February into early March what the strategy would be, which was really to reduce the number of detainees in the IRC.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe saw that take effect from early March, so from 8 March onwards the numbers in detention started to reduce dramatically.\u201d</p> \n<p>The committee also heard evidence from providers of asylum seeker accommodation at Clearsprings Ready Homes and Mears Group, saying testing was not available for their service users despite hundreds of them isolating and living in accommodation with shared areas.</p> \n<p>Taking questions from the Conservative MP Laura Farris, Burnett said: \u201cAt Yarl\u2019s Wood we held a full pandemic contingency planning exercise at the end of January, which ensured we were as prepared as we could be.\u201d</p> \n<p>She added: \u201cThis was done at our instigation but with the Home Office and our healthcare partners Northampton healthcare trust. We worked on that as a tripartite plan which enabled us to get to a position where we could ensure we had sufficient stocks of PPE for example but also to redesign the regime to ensure we could continue to deliver essential services while maintaining the social distancing controls.\u201d</p> \n<p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThere is nothing unusual in immigration removal centres having contingency plans in place for the spread of communicable diseases and these are tested on a regular basis. Immigration removal centres are following all Public Health England advice and if a detainee presents as symptomatic they have access to tests and appropriate medical care.\u201d</p> \n<p>After the hearing, Doughty said: \u201cIt was deeply concerning to hear that many residents and even staff across the asylum accommodation system do not appear to have been able to access testing, despite large numbers becoming symptomatic, which itself is unsurprising given the nature of shared accommodation.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was also revealing that providers appear to have been asked to carry out more extensive pandemic planning from January onwards. This suggests that the Home Office internally knew that the pandemic was likely to worsen and spread in the UK and throws up yet more questions about who knew what, when, and why these insights did not lead to changes in other policies in other areas of Home Office work.\u201d</p>",

Here, in the version that I was sent, it\u2019s early and late Beethoven followed by late Brahms, together with a clutch of seven encores that do range more widely, to Rameau, Schubert, Debussy and Rachmaninov; those who buy the two-CD set also get a bonus DVD of Sokolov playing more Beethoven (the Op 90 and 111 sonatas), as well as Mozart, Schumann and Chopin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/15R3tsjWY6sxnEMZO1Oy0J?si=J2z9xn8ZQ0qsEyqCvjU9rA\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/15R3tsjWY6sxnEMZO1Oy0J\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  <p>The performances, though, are variable, with Sokolov\u2019s Beethoven significantly more convincing than his Brahms, and some gems hidden among the encores, such as Rachmaninov\u2019s G sharp minor prelude, Schubert\u2019s C minor Allegretto and Debussy\u2019s prelude Des pas sur la neige. The very best comes first, with an account of Beethoven\u2019s C major Sonata Op 2 no 3 that magnificently conveys the sense of the young Beethoven testing out the limits of classical sonata form; the Op 119 Bagatelles that follow sometimes conjure up a similar concentrated fierceness, but can also seem matter-of-fact, while the Brahms is often disappointingly heavy handed, as in some of the Op 118 pieces, or lacking in the quiet poetry that makes the Op 119 set so personal.</p> <h2><strong>This week\u2019s other pick</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/28t8sVIiMtYOq52nzeo4Rx?si=zKoB0_dDRQiiwqQy__XP2g\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/28t8sVIiMtYOq52nzeo4Rx\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  <p>It\u2019s always fascinating to hear composers interpreting those who have been significant influences on their own work, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/thomas-ades\">Thomas Ad\u00e8s\u2019</a>s music certainly owes much to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/leos-janacek\">Jan\u00e1\u010dek</a>.

  "<p>Lawyers for an eight-year-old British boy have won a ruling that a Home Office policy denying families like his access to the welfare safety net is unlawful.</p> <p>The boy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/06/eight-year-old-boy-takes-home-office-to-court-for-denying-family-benefits\">took a case</a> to the high court arguing that the Home Office\u2019s no recourse to public funds (NRPF) policy increased the risk of families like his becoming destitute and heightened public health risks by forcing people into overcrowded accommodation or on to the streets.</p> <p>The decision by senior judges is expected to provide a lifeline to people unable to work during the Covid-19 pandemic who are blocked from accessing essential state support.</p> <p>The judges in the case heard that the boy, known in court as W, had lived his entire life in extreme poverty because his mother\u2019s wages as a carer were not enough for her to keep her son properly housed and fed.</p> <p>Under the NRPF policy introduced in 2012 by the then home secretary, Theresa May, the boy\u2019s migrant mother was blocked from receiving the same state support that helped other low-earning parents to survive, including child and housing benefits, or tax credits.</p> <p>The court heard that the boy had moved school five times and had been street homeless with his mother owing to the Home Office\u2019s refusal to allow them access to the social security safety net. The judges were also told that J, as his mother was known in court, had been driven into debt and suffered from serious anxiety.</p> <p>Lord Justice Bean and Mr Justice Chamberlain. said that the relevant immigration rules, and the current instructions to Home Office caseworkers does not adequately take into account human rights obligations.</p> <p>While the home secretary can continue to make grants of leave to remain in the United Kingdom subject to a condition of \u201cno recourse to public funds\u201d it will, however, require aspects of the regime to be amended to make clear to caseworkers the circumstances in which they are obliged not to impose a condition of \u201cno recourse to public funds\u201d, or to lift such a condition if it has already been imposed, in the case of a person who is not currently destitute but will imminently become so without access to public funds.</p> <p>A detailed order is expected to follow, which will set out the steps the Home Office needs to take to comply with the judges\u2019 ruling.</p> <p>Since 2012 an \u201cNRPF condition\u201d has been imposed on all migrants granted the legal right to live and work in the UK (known as \u201climited leave to remain\u201d) on the basis of strong family ties to the country.</p> <p>The high court challenge was supported by the Unity Project, a charity set up three years ago to support families facing destitution as a result of NRPF.</p> <p>The project co-ordinator, Caz Hattam, said: \u201cEven before the pandemic, this policy was trapping working families in the most abject poverty, forcing them into debt and unsafe, insecure housing. Since the Covid-19 outbreak their situations have become even more dire and urgent.</p> <p>\u201cWe provided extensive evidence of how children\u2019s lives are being blighted by this policy, and we welcome the judges\u2019 recognition that their families must be given access to the welfare safety net to prevent them from falling into destitution.\u201d</p> <p>Adam Hundt, a partner at Deighton Pierce Glynn, which brought the case, said: \u201cWe and many others have been telling the Home Office for years that this policy is causing immeasurable, irreversible damage to so many people, but particularly children like the boy who brought this legal challenge.</p> <p>\u201cThe Home Office refused to listen and ignored all the evidence they were shown, so it has now been left to the courts to confront the truth, which is that the policy leads to inhuman and degrading treatment.\u201d</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThe court\u2019s ruling today was not on the principle of the no recourse to public funds policy, it was on the clarity in the policy for those applicants who are seeking to have the no recourse to public funds condition not imposed on them, or lifted if already imposed.</p> <p>\u201cThe Home Office notes the court\u2019s judgment and that its full reasons will follow. We will provide submissions in response.\u201d</p>",

The group calls itself \u201cgroup of mothers\u201d in Burmese. </p> <p>Her village is in an area that was partially controlled by the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) until 2011, when a 17-year ceasefire between the group and Myanmar\u2019s military <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/16/china-burma-hydropower-clashes\">broke down</a>.</p> <p>Fighting between a patchwork of militias broke out across Shan state, and the area has since become the centre of the global methamphetamine trade. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimates that meth made in labs in south-east Asia could be worth more than $60bn (\u00a348bn) a year, and that <a href=\"https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/world/2019-07-18-southeast-asias-meth-gangs-making-60bn-a-year-says-un-report/\">much of it originates in Shan state</a>.</p> <p>The area around Mone Paw village is controlled partly by government troops, partly by the KIA, and partly by an ethnic Palaung armed group called the Ta\u2019ang National Liberation Army.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/apr/2020-04-15T15:58:07.html\" data-alt=\"map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/apr/2020-04-15T15:58:07.html\">map</a> </figure>  <p>The local economy is traditionally based on farming, including maize and rice crops which are sold to Chinese brokers. But with fighting intensifying in recent years, agricultural trade has been eclipsed by meth production.</p> <p>\u201cThe drug problem is growing very fast,\u201d says Ester.</p> <p>According to the UNODC Myanmar is also the world\u2019s second-largest producer of opium, with poppy cultivation centred in Shan. But opium cultivation is declining as regional demand for heroin is overtaken by a booming market for synthetic drugs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/24/the-new-drug-highway-pacific-islands-at-centre-of-cocaine-trafficking-boom\">The new drug highway: Pacific islands at centre of cocaine trafficking boom</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Back in 2012, Ester estimates that most of the men in Mone Paw village \u2013 which has a population of almost 3,000 \u2013 used drugs.</p> <p>Her husband was among them.</p> <p>\u201cI tried very hard to help him. I even locked him in a room for several days. Unfortunately, I failed to help,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The couple divorced in 2012. Soon afterwards, Ester formed the anti-drug group, initiating an informal movement in cooperation with other village women.</p> <p>Some of the men in the village had joined armed groups, while others were away working in China. With the police, the military and rebel armed groups among local authorities involved in the drugs industry to some extent, the women felt they needed to fill the gap.</p> <p>Lashi Htan, the group\u2019s vice-chair, was one of the first to join. Two of her three sons were drug users at the time.</p> <p>\u201cWe were heartbroken to see the ones we love become drug addicts. It brought us together,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Initially, the group helped only their families.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"96d2feb1a274b32adfbc538d4a18055cd7eb102e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96d2feb1a274b32adfbc538d4a18055cd7eb102e/0_0_5384_3590/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Heroin confiscated from a drug dealer\u2019s house in Mone Paw village, Muse township, northern Myanmar\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heroin confiscated from a drug dealer\u2019s house in Mone Paw village.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hkun Lat</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe chained them up and locked them in a room for weeks, sometimes up to a month. We provided them with healthcare and faith healing,\u201d Htan says, referring to their method of treatment, which involves surrounding recovering users with prayer and religious songs .</p> <p>\u201cThank God, my sons are not in hell, but are working in China now,\u201d she says. </p> <p>Nearly a decade after it was formed, the group now covers 22 villages. It conducts surprise checks on vehicles passing through the area, and raids dealers\u2019 houses. The women issue fines and the money funds the group\u2019s operations.</p> <p>\u201cIf they refuse to pay the fine, we destroy their property,\u201d Htan says, explaining that they set it on fire.</p> <p>Sometimes the group sells seized goods at the local market.</p> <p>\u201cAt first, we were not so effective, but we became the last straw for drowning people to grasp,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Armed groups in the area provide the women with security and information about drug production in areas controlled by rivals. The Myanmar military, for example, feeds them information about drug production in areas controlled by the KIA, and vice versa.</p> <p>The women say that to some extent they are being exploited, but that the arrangement helps them on their mission to eradicate drugs.</p> <p>\u201cHalf a loaf is better than none,\u201d says Ester. \u201cWe need to have good relations with armed groups for our safety.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f153c77dca3325b4513bb949e6cf4f7682d6b6db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f153c77dca3325b4513bb949e6cf4f7682d6b6db/0_0_3308_2202/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Internally displaced people and local villagers attend a church service in Myitkyina, Kachin state.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Internally displaced people and local villagers attend a church service in Myitkyina, Kachin state.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ye Aung Thu/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even so, the women often receive threats. A bomb was left outside the front door of Ester\u2019s home in 2014. It was defused and handed to the Mone Paw Militia, who are aligned with Myanmar\u2019s military. \u201cThe father of the drug addict responsible for the bomb came and apologised to me [and said] that this would never happen again,\u201d says Ester. .</p> <p>The government-appointed administrator of Mone Paw village says local authorities and armed groups face limitations in enforcing law. For example, government troops can\u2019t access rebel-held territory.</p> <p>\u201cBut the \u2018Women Pat Jasan\u2019 group can do it freely. They go wherever they want to go,\u201d he says over the phone. The group is informally referred to by this name, because they are believed to have inspired the Christian anti-drug movement Pat Jasan, whose vigilante methods in Kachin State have drawn criticism.</p> <p>In early 2014, the Kachin Baptist Church invited Ester and her group to share their experiences in several towns, including the state capital Myitkyina. A few months later, Pat Jasan was formed. It has since become the largest civilian anti-drug campaign in Myanmar. Its methods include arresting and beating drug users, forcing them into treatment camps and sending teams out to destroy poppy fields of subsistence farmers.</p> <p>Ester\u2019s approach is more flexible, but she says she was, \u201cvery happy to see what they are doing\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSome might say that their way is a bit violent.

  "<p> To begin with, Clare Sutcliffe found the shift from sleeping in a doorway in Soho to a king-size bed in a central-London hotel very disorientating. After 15 months sleeping rough, she found it hard to relax and really believe she was in a safe space.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe first couple of nights, I couldn\u2019t sleep with the light off,\u201d she says. \u201cThis might sound mad, but I was a bit scared. It was different; when you\u2019re used to sleeping out in the open outside and then all of a sudden you\u2019re in a bed, in a room, with a door that shuts.\u201d When she arrived at the hotel five weeks ago, she was a skeletal six-and-a-half stone; since then, with three meals delivered to her room every day, her health has begun to improve.</p> \n<p>\u201cI was very, very underweight. Now I\u2019m sleeping properly, eating properly, bathing properly,\u201d she says. She is sitting in the hotel dining room with a few other guests and (at the appropriate distance) representatives from homelessness charities, who are helping the residents apply for permanent housing.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been anywhere quite like this,\u201d Sutcliffe says, \u201cand I never would have been able to if it weren\u2019t for the circumstances. I came here with nothing. They\u2019ve helped me with everything they possibly could \u2013 my benefits, birth certificate. I had no ID.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sutcliffe, 39, was brought up in children\u2019s homes and became homeless 18 months ago after her partner died. Now she is enjoying spending the time in her room, watching television in bed \u2013 something she hasn\u2019t been able to do for years \u2013 catching up on films she has never seen, enjoying Jurassic Park. In the morning, a newspaper is delivered to her room with breakfast; cleaners deliver fresh sheets once a week and come in to clean the room for her; laundry services are available. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely,\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>Sutcliffe is one of more than 5,400 homeless people across England and Wales currently being <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/communities-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-2-may-2020--2\">housed in hotels</a> at the government\u2019s expense. It is part of an unprecedented emergency operation to get <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/councils-told-to-house-all-rough-sleepers-in-england-by-weekend\">all rough sleepers off the streets</a>, to prevent the spread of Covid-19. This hotel is one of almost 50 Travelodges, Ibis, Holiday Inns and smaller hotels in London (which were empty because of the disappearance of tourists and business travellers) that have been taken over by local authorities and charities.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"df78794d6ba1c2b213edd006e82d0b209d4864dc\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df78794d6ba1c2b213edd006e82d0b209d4864dc/0_254_5976_3586/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charity workers deliver lunch to the hotel\u2019s residents\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charity workers deliver lunch to the hotel\u2019s residents.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The government claims this has been a \u201cremarkable achievement\u201d, with 90% of rough sleepers taken into hotels within the space of a few weeks. Volunteers providing hot meals to the hundreds of homeless who still congregate nightly around hotspots such as Trafalgar Square are much more downbeat, however. They have witnessed the growing numbers of newly homeless. Many of these people have started sleeping rough after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/27/london-coronavirus-sacked-hospitality-workers-sleeping-rough\">losing jobs in restaurants and pubs</a> because of the pandemic. None has been offered a hotel room, and, with day centres and cafes closed, all of them are finding conditions exceptionally harsh. Since businesses have shut down, there is no longer even a supply of cardboard to make sleeping on the pavement more bearable.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"518d4669-c131-492d-9cfa-c7b2f0b4b9e4\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iWhn5GN_Muo?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But if the operation is far from perfect, there is a defiant sense of optimism among those who have been working to reduce rough sleeping for years, at how much can be achieved, very quickly, once there is an injection of money and a government commitment to act. Homelessness charities are racing to work with those brought into hotels to try to make sure that, once lockdown ends and the hotels reopen to tourists and business travellers, they have lined up alternative, more permanent places for the rough sleepers to move to.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been getting people coming in off the streets who haven\u2019t been accommodated for years. Some of our staff have been in tears; there have been so many good news stories,\u201d says Petra Salva, director of rough sleepers at <a href=\"https://www.mungos.org/\">St Mungo\u2019s</a>, which is running the operation in most London hotels. In 20 years spent working in homelessness organisations, she says she has never seen the sector coming together in the way it has over the past two months. \u201cPeople say it\u2019s not possible to end rough sleeping, but we\u2019ve always maintained that it is, with the right attitude and money. But it is a gargantuan challenge.\u201d</p> \n<p>At lunchtime at an IHG hotel (which the Guardian has been asked not to name), the reception area looks much as it would do during more normal times. There are friendly, uniformed staff, politely helping guests who have lost their room keys, but there are also a few signs that the hotel is not operating quite as usual. The spare plastic key cards are floating in a plastic container, filled with transparent anti-bacterial liquid; the bar area is closed, and the beer taps have been wrapped up in cellophane to stop them being used. Security at the entrance has been stepped up to stop drug dealers moving in, and one guest is asking insistently whether staff have made any progress in finding him a pair of trousers that fit.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6bb083545e06dd7f966d781c934f94fe6c946bb5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6bb083545e06dd7f966d781c934f94fe6c946bb5/0_300_5976_3586/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bethan Epps, of St Mungo\u2019s\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bethan Epps, of St Mungo\u2019s, manages the hotel for the duration of the project.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The hotel kitchens are closed, but Red Radish, a catering company that usually provides food to film sets, delivers hot meals, complete with vegan and halal options. St Mungo\u2019s has recruited volunteers, from the lists of people who usually sign up for Crisis at Christmas shifts, and small teams, wearing masks and gloves, make their way around the 150-bedroom, six-floor hotel, knocking at doors and handing out meals in brown paper bags. They have a quick, friendly exchange, checking on residents\u2019 moods, before moving on.</p> \n<p>On the third floor is Sarah, 59, an Australian former chef who has lived in the UK for decades and has been street homeless for a number of years. She has come out of her room to talk to her next-room neighbour, 37-year-old Chelsea, to make arrangements for an evening walk together during their hour of approved exercise outside. Both women (who asked for their real names not to be printed) were brought here from a women\u2019s hostel, where 12 women slept on camp beds in the same room.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is much more luxurious. My room is incredibly spacious; there\u2019s room to do projects,\u201d Sarah says, showing the patchwork blankets she has been knitting during lockdown, spread out over the bed and floor.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"56e805b98faad9f31d14c4fb123f6d71e7ec6f21\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56e805b98faad9f31d14c4fb123f6d71e7ec6f21/1287_6_3111_3530/881.jpg\" alt=\"Daniella was sleeping in cardboard boxes\" width=\"881\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daniella was sleeping in cardboard boxes for a month before coming to the hotel.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>When news of the drive to put rough sleepers in hotels was announced at the end of March, there was predictable snarkiness on social media from people unhappy that the homeless were getting free holidays in suites at the Dorchester. This wasn\u2019t quite the reality; this is a very nice, but basic, three-star hotel. \u201cPeople got the wrong end of the stick,\u201d says Salva. \u201cBut I\u2019m delighted that people who have been on the streets are experiencing a bit of respite.\u201d </p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re safe, looked after, and we get our food provided for us,\u201d says Chelsea. But she, like everyone here, is watching the news anxiously, wondering what will happen once the lockdown ends and the hotels return to normal use. Will they be \u201cdumping people wherever?\u201d she asks. \u201cYou can only hope for the best.\u201d</p> \n<p>Along the corridor, Daniella, 27 (who only wanted her first name to be used), had been living for a month in cardboard boxes under a canal bridge in north London since losing her bar job and the collapse of an abusive relationship. She has found the long hours of enforced isolation in her room hard. \u201cI\u2019m trying to be positive,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s lonely, I guess.\u201d</p> \n<p>Downstairs is Ganiyu Bello Ishola, 40, a former civil servant in the Nigerian ministry for local government. Until recently, he was mainly sleeping in a 24-hour branch of McDonald\u2019s since becoming homeless because of complications with his immigration status. He is impressed by the government\u2019s drive to bring homeless people inside. \u201cI might have died if they hadn\u2019t made a budget to rescue people from the streets,\u201d he says. But, like everyone else, he is increasingly concerned about what will happen when the government ends the lockdown. \u201cI don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going next,\u201d he admits. \u201cThat does depress me sometimes.\u201d</p> \n<p>During our visit on Monday, the hotel seems remarkably calm. \u201cThe levels of behaviour have been what you would expect in a hotel, not a hostel,\u201d says Samantha Dorney-Smith, a nurse with the <a href=\"https://www.pathway.org.uk/\">Pathway</a> charity, which lobbies for better healthcare for rough sleepers. She has been registering residents with GPs (often for the first time) and getting them help with drug, alcohol and mental health services. She describes the exercise as \u201ca very interesting social experiment\u201d. \u201cIf you give people what they want, they tend to take the sensible decisions. The whole focus has been on keeping people quiet and happy \u2013 and maybe we should continue like that, because, funnily enough, it works.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d20ccddb75113cc7c5c05d947ff0d4a0bdcb4c18\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d20ccddb75113cc7c5c05d947ff0d4a0bdcb4c18/0_173_5976_3586/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ganiyu Bello Ishola in his room\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going next\u2019: Ganiyu Bello Ishola in his room.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There have been problems along the way, however. About 60 people have been asked to leave the hotels St Mungos is managing because they have done things such as removing fire alarms from their bedrooms. Some hotels were already providing emergency accommodation for local authorities, and were accustomed to challenging guests. Others have found it more difficult to know how to respond when people have had too much to drink and fallen down the stairs, or when new residents with undiagnosed mental health problems have had psychotic episodes and started shouting at staff. Or when drug dealers have managed somehow to make their way in. But the hotel workers have been amazing, St Mungo\u2019s staff say, absolutely determined to help.</p> \n<p>What there has not been much of is Covid-19. After a slightly chaotic start, arrivals were divided up and those with possible symptoms put in one hotel, those who had tested positive in another, and those with no virus concerns in the rest. People with really serious drug and alcohol issues have been housed separately. Only a handful of rough sleepers in London have had to go to hospital with coronavirus, and no one put into the hotel scheme has died. Given the vulnerability of people who have been rough sleeping for a while, this is a significant achievement, Dorney-Smith says.</p> \n<p>But homelessness workers and hotel residents are equally worried about the dwindling amount of time before this period ends. Bethan Epps, the St Mungo\u2019s worker who is managing this hotel, says: \u201cIt does make me anxious. We really, really don\u2019t want people to go back on the streets after this.\u201d She would like to have another two months, but is realistic about the prospect of finding homes for everyone. At least a quarter have no recourse to public funds, an immigration status that means, in non-pandemic times, they cannot receive any state support. If they are unable to get their jobs back, they will remain homeless. About 30 people in this hotel were living in Heathrow airport before lockdown, many of them with unresolved immigration issues; none would normally be eligible for any help from the either the government or homelessness charities.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"db9924751ff853457f86e8b8b397707f997b80a1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db9924751ff853457f86e8b8b397707f997b80a1/0_55_5848_3507/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Samantha Dorney-Smith\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Samantha Dorney-Smith sees the low rates of Covid-19 among the hotel\u2019s homeless people as a significant achievement.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The main problem is that the exceptional funding granted by the government (two tranches of \u00a31.6bn given to local authorities to fund their Covid-19 response) has already been used. There are no more hotel beds for those homeless now, and no new long-term accommodation to put people in. St Mungo\u2019s own research shows that government cuts have resulted in <a href=\"https://www.mungos.org/news/homelessness-thousands-knocked-back-from-life-saving-treatment/\">funding for drug and alcohol services being reduced</a> by more than a quarter since 2015-16. It also revealed that there were <a href=\"https://www.mungos.org/news/9000-spaces-cut/\">8,755 fewer places</a> in accommodation for homeless people in 2019 than there were in 2010, and that funding for homelessness services has been cut by \u00a31bn a year since 2008/9. The number of people dying while homeless has increased by 51% since 2013.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re faced with a once in a lifetime opportunity of getting it right, and making sure that not one single person who is currently accommodated should go back on to the streets,\u201d says Salva. \u201cA few weeks ago, I thought this was a silver lining in a national tragedy \u2013 that this could be the prize, that we could actually get everyone off the streets. But that\u2019s not going to be the case \u2013 London is going to be a challenge.\u201d She is particularly worried by people falling into sleeping rough during the lockdown because their work has dried up and they have been asked to leave the accommodation that comes with their jobs.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile conditions for those still on the streets have deteriorated rapidly during lockdown. In the first three weeks following the national lockdown orders, there was an 81% rise in alerts to <a href=\"https://www.streetlink.org.uk/\">StreetLink</a>, the charity that connects rough sleepers with services. In London, hungry-looking people have taken to begging at car windows at traffic lights, something more usually seen in Delhi, a measure of desperation at a time of lockdown.

Biosphere 2, named as such because participants believed Earth to be Biosphere 1, featured a desert, a mangrove forest, a 9,000 square-foot ocean with its own coral reef, and a savannah grassland; its eight inhabitants were expected to cultivate their own food and drink, and to maintain livable atmospheric conditions of oxygen and carbon dioxide.</p> <p>Spaceship Earth reveals how this idealistic ambition \u2013 funded, in this case, by Ed Bass, a philanthropic billionaire from Texas oil money \u2013 stemmed from decades of challenging, idiosyncratic work by a counter-cultural group known as the Synergia Ranch. Wolf pieces together early footage of the so-called Synergists, founded in 1969 by ecologist and certified metallurgist John Allen in the height of San Francisco\u2019s hippy days. The Synergists, as the film\u2019s genuinely remarkable archival footage illustrates, thrived on the convivial and industrious energy of their collective, morphing from Jester-style theater to communal ranch to building their own ship (!) on which to sail around the world.</p> <p>Synergist projects ranged from theater to ecology to architecture and science, \u201cbut at the end of the day, they were experimental people, they were adventurers\u201d, said Wolf, who \u201cdefy the typical categories of hippies because they\u2019re counter-cultural people who identify as capitalists\u201d. Allen, in particular, cultivated powerful financial interests such as Bass to fund their increasingly ambitious, science-fiction inspired projects. (The name \u201cSpaceship Earth\u201d comes from the Buckminster Fuller book Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth, which partially inspired Biosphere 2, as well as the futurist ride at Disneyworld\u2019s Epcot theme park).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"58ef458ca919fae6a1045eaadd19d2ed8fa7ccc9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58ef458ca919fae6a1045eaadd19d2ed8fa7ccc9/0_0_1996_1386/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"694\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In the mid-80s, when sustainability and the pressing threat of global warming were far from mainstream concepts, Synergists found in Bass a partner in their mission to build a self-sustaining, miniature world. (Wolf, who said he intended for the film to focus on the Biospherians and not later conflicts over management of the Biosphere, did not invite Bass to participate; he does, however, interview John Allen, who served as executive chairman of Biosphere 2 during the early 90s). The $200m-plus investigation into self-sufficiency recalled, Biospherians say in the film, the frontier explorers of the past.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very intoxicating, that kind of idealism and rhetoric,\u201d said Wolf. \u201cAnd it proved not to translate in the mainstream media context.\u201d Wolf incorporates news clips from the early 90s, which reveal a fixation on the project\u2019s utopian ideals and counter-cultural background. Several reports from the time presented a duality for the project \u2013 science or spectacle? \u2013 as if the project couldn\u2019t be both, or a harbinger of future scientific attention grabs such as Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX. One former researcher on the project called Biosphere 2, in an television interview, \u201ctrendy ecological entertainment\u201d (to prove the point, Wolf includes footage of two Biospherians mud wrestling before a crowd, peering through the glass with their home cameras).</p> <p>\u201cI think one of the fatal flaws of the project is that they called it an experiment, and that comes with the baggage of academic expectations for science,\u201d Wolf said. Biosphere 2, he believes, was \u201ca different kind of science, a whole-systems or total system approach\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/06/spaceship-earth-biosphere-2-documentary\">Spaceship Earth review \u2013 intriguing Biosphere 2 documentary lacks insight</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the time, the conversation around Biosphere 2\u2019s work was \u201clargely dismissive\u201d, said Wolf. \u201cThey had been dubbed failures and in most senses their life\u2019s work had been discounted.\u201d The fact that people often associated Biosphere 2 with the 1996 comedy Biodome with Paulie Shore, \u201cis in some senses a tragedy, given the scope and the ambition of this project\u201d. Still, \u201cwhat\u2019s appealing about Biosphere 2 is the spectacle and theatricality of it,\u201d said Wolf. \u201cThis is a futurist project, and that is outside the realm of traditional science.

(It goes without saying that a film primarily about eight people trapped, albeit voluntarily, in a confined space for months on end has some \u2026 parallels to spring 2020). \u201cThe takeover of Biosphere 2 is analogous to what you could call the takeover of Biosphere 1,\u201d said Wolf. \u201cWe live in a time in which the political powers that be are sabotaging our ability to live sustainably on the planet through insidious policies.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s environmental deregulation, the (pre-corona) booming fossil fuel industries, but also the American gospel of profit maximization, which the Synergists could only escape for so long. The group\u2019s goal to make economically and ecologically viable projects was \u201cnot economically sustainable\u201d, said Wolf, who sees Biosphere 2 as a \u201ccautionary tale\u201d of \u201cthis fantasy of industry and environmentalism coming together to protect our future\u201d.</p> <p>Cautionary tale and imperfect experiment it may be, Wolf said he still hopes viewers \u201cfeel inspired by a group of people who literally reimagined a world\u201d, and whose personal transformation in isolation \u201cwill be useful for viewers today who are now, like the Biospherians, quarantined\u201d.</p> <p>Biosphere 2 demonstrates that \u201cthe model of small groups coalescing around common goals is viable,\u201d said Wolf, but with a balance: \u201cAs we re-enter the world with a certain determination to take new approaches, there are limitations to that idealism because of pervasive forces of capitalism and politics.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Spaceship Earth is available on Hulu and to rent elsewhere from 8 May in the US with a UK date yet to be announced</p></li> </ul>",

The article cited a previous solo crossing of the continent \u2013 a longer journey by Borge Ousland in 1997, in which Ousland used a sail at several points. The article asked why a sail constitutes technological assistance, while a groomed vehicle trail does not.

But it was <a href=\"https://explorersgrandslam.com/\">the Explorers Grand Slam</a> that first took O\u2019Brady to Antarctica. He learned about unsuccessful attempts at a solo, unassisted, unsupported crossing \u2013 such as the one by Henry Worsley, <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/02/12/the-white-darkness\">which cost Worsley his life</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI just got really fascinated by Antarctica,\u201d O\u2019Brady says. \u201cIt was a personal challenge.\u201d</p> <p>He knew from reading about previous attempts that it would takes enormous amounts of physical and mental strength. \u201cCertainly for this one, I was curious about how it would tap into my body, mind and soul,\u201d O\u2019Brady says. \u201cI would be alone in a really intense two months there.\u201d</p> <p>He attempted the feat on cross country skis, dragging a 300lb sled packed with supplies including his tent, stove and provisions.

  "<h2>Seaside perfection, Whitby</h2> <p>A day out in Whitby. Morning tea and fruit cake with Wensleydale at Bothams. Walk to the sea, and out onto the pier. Walk up the beach, climb up the cliff and then back to the town past the whale\u2019s jaw. Fresh crab sandwiches for lunch, then climb the 199 steps to the Priory. Back down, just enough time for afternoon tea and cake before crossing back over the river for a fish supper at the Magpie.

I\u2019m about eight. It\u2019s always very warm and sunny as Dad would never make the short crossing from Sandbanks if there was any chance of cloud or rain. This place that we visited perhaps only once a year with its empty expanses of beach, backdrop of sand dunes, crystal clear sea with yachts in the distance, is magical in my memory. I also remember complaining about the long walk carrying beach paraphernalia around the headland to find a \u201cbetter spot\u201d and worrying I wouldn\u2019t be able to find Mum and Dad again up in the dunes as I came back from the water\u2019s edge.

Following the coast road for 20km or so brings you to the western side of Mount Pelion and the village of Milies. Here, under the shade of an enormous plane tree, you can stare across the Aegean to the Sporades beyond and then, if it\u2019s the weekend, take the narrow-gauge railway train called Old Sooty back down through the mountain to Volos after three too many ouzos.

Travelling there, through vineyards, cicadas in the background, and the Caroux mountains rearing up as we reach our destination, fills us with joy. As we enter the village there is a sharp bend and then in front of us is the bar Auberge du Caroux. There\u2019s the table we will sit at, exchanging greetings with the owner and locals, drinking ros\u00e9 or pastis, coffee on market days or lunch on Sundays, watching the world go by. <br>\u2022 <em><a href=\"https://www.minervois-caroux.com/en/discovery/our-villages/mons-la-trivalle.html\">minervois-caroux.com</a></em><br><strong>Tessa Bucknell</strong></p> <h2>Kyssetrappen, Copenhagen</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bae822c874b7d30bb0c4cdedccb0fe2123df8654\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bae822c874b7d30bb0c4cdedccb0fe2123df8654/28_0_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"kissing steps copenhagen\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Translating as Kissing Steps, this city-centre space epitomises Copenhagen\u2019s inspired approach to urban design. It\u2019s a deceptively simple layout of wide wooden steps leading down to the cleaned-up harbour, surrounded by containers which open into bars and a stage. In the brief summer, locals catch up with friends, sunbathe and swim in the brackish water, often straight from work. Sipping cocktails, listening to low-key DJ sets and egging each other on to jump into the harbour remains one of my favourite family holiday memories of recent years.<br><strong>Nick</strong></p> <h2>First drink in Umbria, Italy</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ca25f833efac2ad0235c20915d7663624db6629\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ca25f833efac2ad0235c20915d7663624db6629/0_112_2314_2889/801.jpg\" alt=\"Drinks outside bar in Allerone, with village street\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Arriving once more at the tiny bar at top of the walled village of Allerona, close to Orvieto, ordering the first drink and sitting at an outside rickety table is to know pure happiness. The view is down the steep village street, glorious with window box geraniums, or, to one side, through a stone archway to roll upon roll of Umbrian hills. Locals drop by to catch up over an espresso or beer \u2013 all greeting the newcomer. Few tourists make it here and, in winter, cold will permeate the stones but in my mind, arriving with endless blue skies, it\u2019s perfection.<br><strong>Lin Leftley</strong></p> <h2>Fish lunch on the beach, Italy</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ab41d263d7968332dee4483cd004088bd1802a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ab41d263d7968332dee4483cd004088bd1802a9/0_138_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"DaAdolfo, Positano, Italy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I often revisit memories of lazy days at Da Adolfo \u2013 a mid-price beach restaurant a short hop from Positano main dock (look for the boat with the red fish sign). Da Adolfo is a local institution, its reputation earned not only for the seafood and homemade pasta but for the bubbling atmosphere. Tourists and locals sit elbow to elbow, the chatter building as more jugs of wine are consumed. Plates are passed down from the cliffside kitchen, waiters jogging barefoot over hot beach pebbles. I can think of no better way to spend an afternoon than flopping back on my lounger after a wonderful lunch, soaking up the sun and taking a dip. <br>\u2022 <em><a href=\"http://www.daadolfo.com/\">daadolfo.com</a></em><br><strong>Chloe Booth</strong><br></p> <h2>Out of Africa, Sierra Leone</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"878d8cf3d4cd2344e2d324ff0be209c528facccc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/878d8cf3d4cd2344e2d324ff0be209c528facccc/0_7_500_300/500.jpg\" alt=\"Tiny tear-shaped tropical island\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nyangai, one of Sierra Leone\u2019s Turtle Islands.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Perry</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Turtle Islands, off the coast of Sierra Leone, are sublime, both scenically and culturally.

The first day was spent hiking up Bromo\u2019s crater and generally frolicking around Bromo national park\u2019s moon-like landscape. On the second day we awoke at 2am to hike up Seruni Point, which is directly opposite Mount Bromo. After around an hour of hiking we found a spot to settle down, eat breakfast and wait for sunrise. Although we knew we had picked a good spot, it wasn\u2019t until later that we really appreciated how lucky we were. This was the view that welcomed us when the sun came up.

My happy place is called Long Beach, a wide hard-packed beach on the open Pacific side of Vancouver Island. In the early 1970s, before it became part of Pacific Rim national park, you could drive on the beach and camp anywhere. It was an adventure to get there on logging roads through the mountains. The sound and sight of endless rollers coming in off the ocean, the salty breeze, the bald eagles, the camp fires and starry nights, the purity and isolation shared with friends ... although I live far away, that place will always be my spiritual home. <br><strong>Peter Lowrey</strong></p> <p><em>Because of the coronavirus crisis there is <strong>no prize on offer for the week\u2019s best entry</strong> \u2013 though hopefully that will return soon</em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/series/readers-travel-tips\">Have a look at our past readers\u2019 tips articles</a></strong></p>",
  "<p>When lockdown started, I was confused by bodies on television. Why weren\u2019t they socially distancing? Didn\u2019t they know not to be so close? The injunction to be separate was unfamiliar and irregular, and for me, self-isolating alone, following this government directive was peculiar. It made watching dramas and programmes produced under normal filming conditions feel jarring.</p> <p>Seven weeks in, the disjuncture has passed. I, like all of us, am accommodating to multiple corporeal realities: bodies alone, bodies distant, bodies in the park to be avoided, bodies of disobedient youths hanging out in groups, bodies in lines outside shops, bodies and voices flattened on screens and above all, bodies of dead health workers and carers. Black bodies, brown bodies. Working-class bodies. Bodies not normally praised, now being celebrated.</p> <p>We are learning a whole new etiquette of bodies. We swerve around each other, hop into the near-empty street, calculate distances at entrances to parks, avoid body contact, even eye contact, and keep a look out for those obliviously glued to their phones, whose lack of attention threatens to breach the two-metre rule. It\u2019s odd and disconcerting and isn\u2019t quite second nature.</p> <p>Until the pandemic arrived, many of us were finding texting, email and Whatsapp more suitable to our speeded-up lives. But now we are coming to reuse the telephone, and to enjoy the sounds in our ears and the rhythm of conversation, instead of feeling rushed and interrupted. A few of my sessions as a psychoanalyst are now conducted on the phone but, for the most part, I am spending my time looking into a screen, and seeing faces rather than whole bodies. Until I learned to turn off the view of myself, I, like others, was disconcerted by the oddness of catching sight of myself \u2013 a view I don\u2019t think we are meant to see.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ee3ce8ae73dc3e0c4a544cc42f6030d59f87154f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee3ce8ae73dc3e0c4a544cc42f6030d59f87154f/0_0_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Neighbours social distancing in Syracuse, New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neighbours social distancing in Syracuse, New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maranie Staab/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Conversations in therapy defy many of the customs of social intercourse. There are silences, repetitions, reframings, links across time, reminiscences of fragments, rushes of emotion, shards of dreams, things told and then disavowed. There can be fidgeting or absolute stillness. These form the idiosyncratic and personal ambience between each therapeutic couple. As a therapist, I am also alert to how the dilemmas that beset the person or the couple I am seeing are brought to our relationship.</p> <p>The conundrums that brought the person to seek therapy in the first place can be replayed right here. For example, a person fearful of intimacy can experience the therapy relationship or the therapist as too close. Someone else who worries they are too needy may be reluctant to show their longings directly to the therapist, although well able to talk about how things go wrong for them in other relationships. The therapy relationship and the sessions are our petri dish. The field of study is the human subject (and her, his or their ways of being able to develop and change).</p> <p>The therapist works to understand an individual\u2019s personal psychological grammar \u2013 to help the person take the risk of unlearning and then learning anew, finding ways to not be in so much hurt. So too with the body. Those with troubled bodies bring them to the session. They may sit too close, for example, or seem to be concave, or dress incongruously, as though presenting a different persona in each session. In the course of therapy, such an abject body experience can be addressed, and, in unlearning and then learning anew, the person finds a more comfortable way to sit in their body.</p> <p>How is the dematerialisation of bodies affecting us and going to affect us? Me, my patients, you \u2013 all of us? For some of my patients, their screen or home is a prison. Their experience is full of woe and worry. Therapy keeps them just about on the border of sane, but it\u2019s a sanity that hurts: isolation can maraud all of us as we miss the interactions, intimate or casual, that confirm our sense of our value, our place in our community, our work and the world.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Some of my clinical preoccupations centre on how we acquire a physical, corporeal sense of self. Although psychoanalysis is a theory of mind and body, its main emphasis has drifted to the development of the mind and its structures: what we call defences, and the relationship patterns we have absorbed. Bodies have been very much the bit player to the main drama of the mind, even when mental processes or disturbance have resulted in bodily symptoms such as eczema or a non-biologically induced paralysis. As therapists, we traditionally read back into the mind the troubles visited on the body, seeing them as the result of mental conflicts. And of course, they often are, but I have long been keen to understand body troubles and body difficulties in their own terms, and to build a theory about the development of the body.</p> <p>Bodies have always been bound and marked by social rules. Different societies make different sense out of similar bodily actions or gestures. The variety of body adornment and transformations around the world, from rings around the neck to the recent upsurge in labial reductions and penis enlargements, has made it ever more apparent that the body is not simply the product of DNA. The body we inhabit develops within relationships to other bodies. Usually it is within the maternal orbit where, to take an obvious example, we first apprehend gender-based forms of comportment. When I grew up, being told to sit like a girl and not to climb trees were some of the ways we were treated differently to boys. Research across many cultures show that baby girls are weaned and potty-trained earlier, fed less at each feed, and held less, than boys. There may be no biological basis to this, but rather a social, unconscious basis that then informs how we personally experience our particular embodiment.</p> <p>We have very few verified reports of humans growing up outside of human culture but the feral child Victor of Aveyron, who was discovered living wild in the woods of southern France in 1800, did not have body movements that were recognisably human. The body-to-body relationship that was foundational for him was with the bodies of the wolves he apparently grew up among. He seemingly mimicked their gait and moves, their posture and their vocalisations. Of course, we know this more familiarly, and less dramatically, from when youngsters develop their group identities by adopting the mannerisms of film actors or musicians.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"147b2555952e97f1b55a6ddbb4ed6162dcd0d1f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/147b2555952e97f1b55a6ddbb4ed6162dcd0d1f3/540_836_4605_2594/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Social distancing during the opening of the Dragon\u2019s Heart hospital in Cardiff last month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Social distancing during the opening of the Dragon\u2019s Heart hospital in Cardiff last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Horwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Through screens, billboards and photoshopped images, we reduce the wide variety of bodily expression. It\u2019s as though we are losing body diversity just as we are losing languages. The digitised, westernised body image predominates, and in the last two decades has spawned a cosmetic surgery industry worldwide \u2013 from leg-lengthening surgery using steel rods in China (now banned), to rhinoplasty in Iran (which has the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2013/mar/01/beauty-obsession-iran-cosmetic-surgery?CMP=twt_gu\" title=\"\">highest rate</a> of nose surgery per capita in the world) to double-eyelid surgery and jawbone reduction in South Korea. In the west, surgeons resculpt cheekbones, breasts and calves, and offer day procedures for facial \u2018thread lifts\u2019. Cosmetic surgery tourism hubs in Hungary, South Korea and Singapore were thriving until the lockdown.</p> <p>One Chinese smartphone app allows the selfie-taker to adjust their portrait to bring it closer to a very specific standard of beauty known as <em>wang hon lian,</em> or \u201cinternet celebrity face\u201d. It\u2019s very popular: billions of wang hon lian images are uploaded every month.</p> <p>The richest Europeans are not in tech, but in the business of beautifying bodies \u2013 the owners of fashion, luxury and cosmetics brands such as LVMH, L\u2019Oreal and Zara. Increasing automation has led us to move from using our bodies to make things to turning our bodies the site and the product of our labour, through diet and exercise regimes, clothing and cosmetics. The surface body is meant to be on display.</p> <p>Paradoxically, the sweating, smelling, holding, stroking body of the other becomes, for those socially distancing, too distant \u2013 while for others, such as those sharing a house with teenage boys, it\u2019s all too present. All is on show for families and housemates, while all is hidden for those living alone during lockdown.</p> <p>The experience of the body on FaceTime or Zoom contrasts with the pulsing, breathing, weeping, sighing, tired, achy or indeed springy and enthusiastic bodies we inhabit. We no longer have social communion in the flesh, the handshake or the hug, the pleasure of eating in a restaurant with a friend or lover while seated near strangers. Afraid of infection, for our protection, we collapse our social space.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>During the second world war, the psychiatrist Ren\u00e9 Spitz studied orphan babies in care. He discovered that those closest to the nurses\u2019 station thrived, while those at the end of the ward did not do so well. The difference was touch: the nurses would casually touch and interact with those closest to them, and this gave those infants the essential food for physical and psychological development. They absorbed the will to live. A decade later \u2013 in research now considered controversial for the way in which he removed baby monkeys from their mothers \u2013 the American psychologist <a href=\"https://www.psychologicalscience.org/publications/observer/obsonline/harlows-classic-studies-revealed-the-importance-of-maternal-contact.html\" title=\"\">Harry Harlow discovered</a> that baby monkeys given ersatz mothers in the form of basic cloth puppets would find some crucial security and comfort even in this simulation of maternal touch; those baby monkeys deprived of any kind of maternal touch at all became highly disturbed, and many died.</p> <p>Touch, feel and proximity are central to survival. Consider the genius of premature infants\u2019 capacity to regulate their own and, extraordinarily, their parent\u2019s body temperature, if they are <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/12578-kangaroo-care\" title=\"\">held skin-to-skin in a pouch</a>. The gaze \u2013 the search to be seen, to recognise and to influence the other \u2013 is also crucial to human subjectivity. In <a href=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/thoughtful-animal/ed-tronick-and-the-8220-still-face-experiment-8221/\" title=\"\">a fascinating video</a> made by the developmental psychologist Edward Tronick, he instructs a mother playing with her baby to keep a still face and refrain from interacting with her infant for a minute or two. We observe as the infant girl seeks to engage the mother. When she is unable to, the baby collapses psychologically and physically until contact is restored. What is so shocking is how fast the collapse is.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve been thinking of how impossibly difficult and challenging our quasi-dematerialised life through the Zoom screen is, whether chatting with friends or being in a meeting. Conflict and harmony become cartoonish as subtle gestures collapse and the conversations we have with our eyes are shut down.</p> <p>Reading each other well enough is a new skill in the therapy room, too, for both people. By now we are used to the screens and the telephone, and the occasional technical blips. We are seeing a physical interior \u2013 a study, bedroom, shed or kitchen, and being surprised by an occasional child that floats in. We hear the suddenly hushed voice of someone not wanting their partner to get a drift of the conversation we are having. It illuminates aspects we didn\u2019t see before. Is it better? No. Is it worse? Marginally. I miss noticing how people enter the therapy room \u2013 the subtle difference from the session before, or the way they may hold their face and body; above all, the animate body in the room. I suspect that I am more animated to make up for the loss of that precious physicality.</p> <p>Former hostages Terry Waite, John McCarthy and Brian Keenan have all written and spoken eloquently about solitary confinement and their struggles to find a way through and back \u2013 or should I say forward \u2013 to familial and social life. It was tough. And although many of us are not self-isolating alone, unless one is able to do interesting or valued work during this period, or have enough people to hang out with, we can expect considerable psychological difficulties to follow as we come out of lockdown. How will we re-establish social interaction with other bodies? What kind of rhythms will we want and be able to have going forward?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5f7f6e5510591fc2fed7372dbecabfaf0b09a152\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f7f6e5510591fc2fed7372dbecabfaf0b09a152/0_0_4860_3240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Seating regulations inside a courtroom in Belgium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Seating regulations inside a courtroom in Belgium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many have been ultra-busy with home schooling, working from home, managing three generations and so on. Time has bent and contracted in perplexing ways. Busyness has increased for some, while others, for whom slowing down is a foreign concept, have had idleness forced on them. Empty time feels alien \u2013 or at least did at the beginning. For many it has been an unexpected pleasure. No need to rush to social occasions. No need to dress. No need to get everything done and more. Being wanted, being needed, being in demand have been psychological supports that have melted away. Finding new ways to nourish one\u2019s needs in this new reality \u2013 especially in the absence of touch and gaze, which we unknowingly rely upon to recognise ourselves \u2013 can be tricky.</p> <p>Today, there is a frightened, wary, social body. A body that is tense, in which avoidance is the watchword. The covered face, whether by a hoodie or a veil, which formerly some found challenging, now offers reassurance. Indeed, many public places \u2013 from Eurostar trains to the streets of New York, Prague, Dubai, Havana and many more \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/countries-wearing-face-masks-compulsory-200423094510867.html\" title=\"\">now demand it</a>. Meanwhile, much of society is now paying attention to bodies that had been scandalously overlooked. The bodies of working women, the carers who go in and out of the houses and homes of the people they look after. The faces of vast numbers of black, Asian and minority-ethnic bodies, particularly in the health service, who are finally being recognised for their value, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/british-bame-covid-19-death-rate-more-than-twice-that-of-whites\" title=\"\">shockingly disproportionate</a> number of their losses. </p> <p>Before Covid-19, the ruling party were happy to slash social and health funding, to put money into management in the NHS, and not into professional carers, doctors and nurses. Now society is waking up to the value of care and medical expertise that comes from the hospital floor \u2013 that is to say, from the doctors and nurses who are reorganising what occurs there. The people keeping society going in every sector \u2013 transport workers, small shopkeepers, workers in food production and delivery \u2013 are often first-generation immigrants. More people are seeing a more nuanced social landscape. The opportunity is here for reframing how we represent the social body. It is of necessity differently hued, and that needs acknowledging, as does the shame of our previous marginalising. Covid-19 is cleaning the lens, so we can see more clearly.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>From the individual to the social body, and how it is being challenged by the pandemic, we turn to the corporate body \u2013 the body of state \u2013 and what we have been learning about how it has functioned. On 17 April, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/anthony-costello\" title=\"\">Prof </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/anthony-costello\" title=\"\">Anthony Costello</a>, a former director of the Institute for Global Health at UCL, told the select committee on health and social care that he feared Britain might have the highest number of deaths in Europe, which has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-above-32000-to-highest-in-europe\" title=\"\">now been confirmed</a>. Costello had estimated 40,000 deaths; on 5 May the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/coronavirus-uk-how-many-confirmed-cases-are-there-in-my-area\" title=\"\">official UK death toll</a> was just over 32,000, but the Financial Times reported the same day that the true figure had likely <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e32ddbf7-0826-4cf7-9a73-18611eb29c23\" title=\"\">already surpassed</a> Costello\u2019s estimate. London and the north-west of England are showing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/03/north-west-overtakes-london-for-number-of-covid-19-hospital-cases-coronavirus\" title=\"\">higher rates</a> of death than other regions, while according to the ONS, people in the most deprived areas of England and Wales are dying at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/covid-19-deaths-twice-as-high-in-poorest-areas-in-england-and-wales\" title=\"\">twice the rate</a> of the most affluent areas.</p> <p>Costello argued for this figure because we were slow off the mark to take precautionary moves early on. He spoke to the chair of the committee, Jeremy Hunt, who has spent this period appearing to stress about the lack of testing, ventilators and PPE equipment. This is the same Hunt who, as the longest serving health secretary in British history, also had social care in his portfolio, and the pay of doctors, nurses and social care workers. Even more damningly, he was the minister in charge during <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/28/matt-hancock-urged-to-publish-secret-review-of-pandemic-plans\" title=\"\">Exercise Cygnus</a>, the UK government\u2019s drill to test our preparedness for a pandemic, carried out in 2016.</p> <p>The full review of Exercise Cygnus has never been officially published, but leaks have revealed that it showed the UK\u2019s health system and local authorities were woefully unprepared for such an eventuality. The <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/28/exercise-cygnus-uncovered-pandemic-warnings-buried-government/\" title=\"\">exercise showed</a> hospitals and mortuaries being quickly overwhelmed, and shortages of critical care beds, ventilators and personal protective equipment for hospital staff. </p> <p>Cygnus, and other such exercises, are meant to show the government what they need to do to be prepared \u2013 which was not, as Hunt was doing, cutting beds. On 28 March of this year, when the Cygnus debacle came to light, we were told that the projections were not remedied because of worries that beds, ventilators and PPE would become outmoded or obsolete and that the government had worked on securing reliable supply chains. (As we have seen, in a pandemic, reliable supply chains become very quickly overwhelmed.)

The ethics of cooperation in Europe and the ethics of transparency and honesty have been mightily tested in the past months. Perhaps now though we can be encouraged by the joint project of the European Investment Banks and WHO to bolster global healthcare systems. Will the UK state be contributing? I think not.

This voluntary work, in which groups of people self-organise, is outstanding, and yet it is in contrast to the inability of our state to mobilise those who wanted to help.</p> <p>The Gates Foundation\u2019s contributions to seven different vaccine programmes, and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey\u2019s donation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/07/twitter-chief-to-donate-quarter-of-his-fortune-to-coronavirus-fight\" title=\"\">$1bn</a>, are impressive.

Could the mood of the country be such that hedge fund investors and managers might be persuaded to donate some of their obscene profits to the coronavirus response or to sponsor migrants from beyond Europe (who work here as cleaners, carers, drivers), who do not earn the \u00a330,000 currently demandedfor a work permit?</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Covid is a sad story. It is also a story of resilience. The body of state has failed us. We need to grow up and recognise that. Covid-19 has exposed unforgivable systemic failure. In the years leading up to this, we\u2019ve seen a reduction in the status of civil servants and a downgrading of health workers. We have seen teachers, doctors and academics hidebound in a managerial economy. At least it seems that micromanagement has been temporarily overturned in hospitals, thank goodness, because right now doctors and nurses need to be running the show.</p> <p>And to return to our bodies \u2013 the live ones, so many devoid of touch and gaze, facing a long period of isolation, and frightened. How can I conclude?</p> <p>In a way, I can\u2019t. We are far from the other side of this crisis. Psychological therapies are going to have a huge part to play in the remaking of body and soul. I don\u2019t much like the word trauma, because it has become so overused, but we are a society that is in trauma. A societal trauma gives opportunities for people to go through things together, rather than suffer alone, as long as we don\u2019t bury or make light of what we have experienced and continue to experience. We will have to find new ways to live with our fears and discomforts, to overcome Covid-minted social phobias, with what we project on to other people\u2019s bodies and the fears we have about our own vulnerabilities. We will need all the help we can get in reshaping our relationship to our own and each other\u2019s bodies, to find a way to build bonds of attachment and respect.</p> <p>What started with the dematerialisation of the individual body has now morphed into the dematerialisation of the body of state. The economist Joseph Stiglitz reminds us that, with the stripping back of the state under Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, we lost capacity. This needs to be addressed. </p> <p>There is a lively debate from a range of economists on how to get to a more equitable economy. Moneyweek editor-in-chief Merryn Somerset Webb\u2019s call for a <a href=\"https://moneyweek.com/economy/uk-economy/601261/turn-the-covid-19-bailout-into-a-sovereign-wealth-fund\" title=\"\">sovereign</a> <a href=\"https://moneyweek.com/economy/uk-economy/601261/turn-the-covid-19-bailout-into-a-sovereign-wealth-fund\" title=\"\">wealth</a> <a href=\"https://moneyweek.com/economy/uk-economy/601261/turn-the-covid-19-bailout-into-a-sovereign-wealth-fund\" title=\"\">fund</a>, with the government owning shares in bailed-out companies, is interesting, as is political economist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/03/the-promise-of-an-oxford-vaccine-reveals-how-a-new-britain-could-thrive\" title=\"\">Will Hutton\u2019s idea</a> of expanding the British Business Bank and the Future Fund.

We will have to do that again. Principally, we will need to recognise the contributions and the losses of the UK\u2019s minority and working-class people, above all. Our governments have shamed themselves through creating divisions in society, particularly since austerity was imposed under David Cameron\u2019s government. Now we have an unexpected chance to redress the divisive fallout of Brexit.</p> <p>The impact of remote working and the need to balance domestic and work life, allied with dire warnings on mass unemployment, gives us an opportunity to write a social contract in which we divide work more fairly. At both ends of the pay scale, people overwork. The evidence for a more balanced relationship between work and home is compelling.</p> <p>Since the crisis began, the outpourings of artists, musicians, programmers, cultural and scientific workers at all levels has been outstanding. The talent, the will, the desire is there to remake our world. The urgency is not in question. Globalism can\u2019t simply be a celebration of \u201cjust-in-time\u201d deliveries. It will need to be recast as mutuality \u2013 local and global mutuality \u2013 so that we learn from each other, including those who\u2019ve been in lockdown in war zones.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/23/therapy-during-coronavirus-pandemic-lockdown-psychoanalysis-freud\">Therapy under lockdown: 'I\u2019m just as terrified as my patients are'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Our institutions will need to be rebuilt with transparency, with heart and by learning from the people who have been staffing them, not just the managers and owners. Doctors, nurses, carers and delivery people have things to say about how their institutions could be better run.

  "<p>It must be painful to be racist right now. Knowing that if you become sick, a black or brown person is highly likely to be involved in the hard, dangerous service of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/nhs-bosses-say-bame-staff-should-be-risk-assessed-to-cut-covid-19\">trying to save you</a>. Knowing that if you need to get to work, a black or brown person is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/19/bame-dying-coronavirus-sadiq-khan\">disproportionately likely</a> to be involved in getting you there via bus, train or cab. Knowing that if you eat fresh food, migrant workers are having to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/17/british-workers-reject-fruit-picking-jobs-as-romanians-flown-in-coronavirus\">flown into the country</a> to pick it because there aren\u2019t enough British workers willing to do it.</p> <p>I don\u2019t believe Britain is a country of racists. But we <em>have</em> been conditioned to erase the contribution of ethnic minorities to our national identity.</p> <p>The last time we were in a period of national crisis, a settlement \u2013 a social contract \u2013 was reached between the state and the British people. In 1945, in exchange for subjecting the civilian population to total war, the government offered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/mar/14/past.education\">the welfare state</a>.</p> <p>We eulogise this as the offer of housing, welfare and unemployment benefits, healthcare and legal aid. The British people had earned their entitlement to these benefits, which formed a foundational part of what it meant to be a citizen of this country.</p> <p>But there was one fundamental problem. The millions of Africans, Asians and other people who came to be regarded as \u201cethnic minorities\u201d (though they weren\u2019t a minority in the empire) \u2013 and who made both this wartime victory, and the new welfare state institutions possible \u2013 were not part of the story.</p> <p>And what followed shows that when you exclude people from the narrative, they become excluded in real life. The idea of being entitled to a share in Britishness, and its national wealth, erased the contribution of black, Asian and ethnic minority people. And, over the decades that followed, the breakdown of the social contract \u2013 as the state remorselessly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/08/austerity-kills-life-expectancy-standstill-britain\">cut back its spending</a> and stopped fulfilling its side of the bargain \u2013 was blamed on the presence of those visible, allegedly unentitled \u201coutsiders\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s beyond ironic that black and Asian people in Britain underpinned the creation of the institutions that so often define Britishness, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/jun/18/nhs60.nhs2\">not least the NHS</a>. Yet that same postwar era also laid the foundations for the inadequate access to healthcare, housing and secure labour that must be part of the reason why minorities are so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/may/01/why-bame-people-may-be-more-at-risk-from-coronavirus-video-explainer\">disproportionately affected</a> by today\u2019s coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>Britain has long needed a new social contract, a new consensual agreement between the government and the governed, that sets out updated values and expectations. Maybe now \u2013 as even a Conservative government is forced to be radically redistributive, with conditional bailouts offering the prospect of more fiscally and socially responsible business, and the NHS becoming an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/pots-pans-passion-britons-clap-their-support-for-nhs-workers-again\">emotional part of Britain\u2019s identity</a> once more \u2013 we might get one.</p> <p>The difference between this moment and the social contract of 75 years ago, is that this time the service and sacrifice of ethnic minority people in Britain is impossible to ignore. It\u2019s clear that racial injustice deserves a central place in our new settlement.</p> <p>Yet despite this, black and Asian individuals with questionable positions on racial justice have suddenly found themselves promoted. Munira Mirza \u2013 who opposed Theresa May\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/theresa-may-s-phoney-race-war-is-dangerous-and-divisive\">racial disparities audit</a> \u2013 is now <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2020/03/whos-charge-inside-no-10-maverick-advisers-running-britain\">head of policy</a> at No 10. And Trevor Phillips, the former equalities chief who was suspended from the Labour party over <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51797316\">accusations of Islamophobia</a>, was appointed to the Covid-19 inquiry \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/coronavirus-medics-condemn-trevor-phillips-role-investigating-uk-ethnic-minority-deaths\">provoking </a><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/coronavirus-medics-condemn-trevor-phillips-role-investigating-uk-ethnic-minority-deaths\">protests</a> from many of the black and minority NHS workers whose trust the inquiry most needs. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the government steadfastly refuses to revisit the utterly <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/uk-migrant-workers-desperate-need-crucial-financial-support-during-covid-19-pandemic\">draconian ban on migrant workers</a> \u2013 including those serving the public on the coronavirus frontline \u2013 accessing public funds, leading to warnings of a new epidemic of destitution.</p> <p>And we now witness the remarkable full circle of Britain recruiting foreigners to carry out essential work, whether in agriculture or the NHS. It\u2019s just like the last time \u2013 when Enoch Powell was among the first to ask Caribbean nurses to come and work in the NHS before turning to race hate. But this time it\u2019s taking place quietly, so we can continue the national pastime of deluding ourselves that Britain can survive without immigrants, while our very survival depends on their labour.</p> <p>Before the virus hit, Britishness as an identity had drifted into a dark place of dishonesty and cognitive dissonance, where we correctly identified that something had broken down, but blamed minorities and outsiders, rather than the betrayal of a promise.</p> <p>Now we have an opportunity to correct that wrong, by acknowledging that we will all be worse off, whatever our colour, unless racial justice and equality lies at the heart of our shared future.</p> <p>\u2022 Afua Hirsch is a Guardian columnist</p>",

  "<p>Film-makers like it when critics use the word \u201crestrained\u201d to describe their work because it implies an intellectual rigour mostly absent in the excessive spectacles of mainstream cinema. Audiences who are looking for something more substantial like it too, for the same reasons. So for what it\u2019s worth, let me say this right off the bat: director Ben Lawrence\u2019s Sydney-set drama Hearts and Bones, which revolves around the relationship between a war photographer and a South Sudanese refugee, is certainly restrained.</p> <p>It is a human-oriented drama that builds a thoughtful and contemplative space, empathising with characters grappling with difficult circumstances outside the common experience. It is also the kind of drama you sometimes want to grab and shake to life. Get the lens a little dirty; knock the camera around a bit; bring a sense of urgency to the edit; get the script (by Lawrence and Beatrix Christian) to draw bold conclusions to the ethical questions it raises rather than pussyfoot around with vague ruminative responses.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/28/desperately-seeking-susan-and-she-devil-absurd-80s-comedies-ripe-for-redemption\">Desperately Seeking Susan and She-Devil: absurd 80s comedies ripe for redemption</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One thing you never want to mess with is the performances. The protagonist is played by Hugo Weaving, an actor who expresses pathos as if it were a weight constantly pulling him down. The most intense moments in Weaving\u2019s performances, in this film and more generally speaking, tend to occur when he feigns losing control; when the performer\u2019s trademark stoicism gives away to a volcanic inner force.</p> <p>Weaving plays Dan Fisher, a famous photographer who suffers panic attacks in increasing frequency. This is partly to do with angst concerning his pregnant partner Josie \u2013 played by an affecting Hayley McElhinney, whose performance balances assurance with tenderness. The nature of Dan\u2019s trepidation towards their impending baby is best left for the film to disclose. Mostly, however, his PTSD-like panic attacks connect to terrible things he has seen during wartime, one of which we witness in the film\u2019s opening moments.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4388653eb77f2a9a7da5c38fb0f826fee0a452a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4388653eb77f2a9a7da5c38fb0f826fee0a452a5/0_0_3543_2363/1000.jpg\" alt=\"two men playing instruments\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ahead of an upcoming exhibition, a South Sudanese cab driver arrives on Dan\u2019s door with a special request.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Madman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That moment, which involves Dan prioritising the duties of being a photographer over intervening in a dangerous situation and potentially saving a life, casts a pall that hangs over the rest of the film. Yet it remains unexplored: just left there, hanging, as a way to make the point that the protagonist Has Seen Things. By the end of it we have no idea whether Dan subscribes to the bogus, outdated idea that a professional photographer (or documentarian) should never interact with the environment around them, but only capture it. That used to be a badge of honour certain photographers wore, as if <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/images-of-suffering-can-bring-about-change-but-are-they-ethical-100809\">capturing suffering</a> were a more noble pursuit than helping another human in front of them.</p> <p>Ahead of an upcoming exhibition, Dan is approached by a South Sudanese cab driver, Sebastian (Andrew Luri), who arrives on his door with a special request: that Dan photograph an African community choir he belongs to. My first thought was that this would lead to the broken Dan becoming whole again by belting out a few uplifting songs with the choristers. But Sebastian has an ulterior motive: he doesn\u2019t want Dan to exhibit photographs of a massacre at the village where he lived 15 years ago. He has his own reasons for this, which are explored over the course of the running time and are points of tension between the two characters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15b1085902fbef50390fabd63d3f3d04d11b8ac0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15b1085902fbef50390fabd63d3f3d04d11b8ac0/575_0_1429_858/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Seb and Dan looking at photos in dim light\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An ulterior motive.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Madman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most of the drama involves dealing with deep-seated emotional wounds and growing tensions between the two men. Newcomer Andrew Luri is terrific opposite Weaving, more than holding his own against the seasoned veteran. Luri plays Sebastian as a determined but deeply conflicted man whose solutions often exacerbate his problems. Every once in a while he responds to a stressful situation with violence, creating a sense of untrustworthiness that agitates an otherwise pleasant demeanour. At times you want to give him a hug; at times you want to stay well clear of him.</p> <p>The tone, temperament and pacing of Hearts and Bones is certainly consistent, though visually there is nothing particularly rich or cinematic about it. Lawrence and his cinematographer Hugh Miller conjured a more interesting, and much moodier look in the director\u2019s previous film, Ghosthunter, an atmospheric documentary investigating a Sydney security guard who claims to chase spirits in his spare time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/03/from-hannah-gadsbys-douglas-to-the-great-whats-new-to-streaming-in-australia-in-may\">From Hannah Gadsby's Douglas to The Great: what's new to streaming in Australia in May</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ghosthunter similarly explores themes of long-standing trauma, and the inability for any of us to escape our past. Both of Lawrence\u2019s films ruminate on one of the greatest lines uttered so far in 21st century cinema, spoken by, of all people, the protagonist of the 2009 family film Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs: \u201cYou can\u2019t run away from your own feet.\u201d</p> <p>It took deep thought to come up with a line like that, and terrific efficiency to distill such profound sentiments into so few words. Hearts and Bones makes profound statements also but is not a work of narrative economy, that\u2019s for sure. Dramatically, it has a vague, lingering quality, at times meditative (another critic-deployed word film-makers tend to like) and sometimes a little inert. On the plus side, the performances are very strong and have plenty of space to breathe. The tone is measured, contemplative and, yes, restrained.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Hearts and Bones is out now through iTunes, Google Play, YouTube, Sony PlayStation, Telstra and Fetch TV, and will be available on DVD on 3 June</em></p>",
