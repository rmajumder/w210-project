  "<p>Devastating tornadoes ripped through central parts of Tennessee this month leaving at least 25 people dead and a trail of destruction to homes and businesses. The storms were the strongest to hit the region in almost a decade, with recorded wind speeds as high as 165mph. Trees were knocked down and power supplies disrupted. John C Tune airport in Nashville also suffered extensive damage, with almost 100 aircraft damaged or destroyed.</p> <p>Elsewhere, an unusually deep area of low pressure, nicknamed the \u201cdragon\u201d on social media, brought severe disruption to western parts of the Mediterranean and the Middle East last week. The low formed rapidly across Egypt, before moving slowly north-eastwards into Israel and Lebanon, bringing outbreaks of heavy rain and strong winds. Thunderstorms caused particularly severe flooding in parts of Egypt, forcing authorities to shut schools and urge people to remain at home. Latest reports indicate at least 20 people have died, including children.</p> <p>Meanwhile, research on the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets has revealed considerable ice loss and acceleration recently due to rising global temperatures. Satellite data indicates both ice sheets are losing mass six times faster than during the 1990s, with an estimated loss of 6.4tn tonnes between 1992 and 2017.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump has announced the US will close its border with Canada to \u201cnon-essential traffic\u201d in an attempt to curb what he again called the \u201cChinese virus\u201d, prompting further allegations of racism.</p> \n<p>In a string of tweets about the coronavirus outbreak on Wednesday, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1240271178692005889?s=20\">Trump wrote:</a> \u201cWe will be, by mutual consent, temporarily closing our Northern Border with Canada to non-essential traffic. Trade will not be affected. Details to follow!\u201d</p> \n<p>At the White House coronavirus taskforce briefing, he added: \u201cYou can only be vigilant and very professional, but it\u2019s not pertaining at this moment to trade between the two countries.\u201d</p> \n<p>In another of a series of measures on Wednesday, the US Senate overwhelmingly passed legislation providing billions of dollars to limit the damage from the coronavirus pandemic through free testing, paid sick leave and expanded safety-net spending.</p> \n<p>The bill, which was backed by Trump, now goes to him to be signed into law. Congress and the White House are discussing additional stimulus measures that could cost more than $1tn.</p> \n<p>Earlier in the day<strong> </strong>the president also said he would invoke the Defense Production Act, aimed at getting the private sector to produce more emergency supplies. But he later appeared to walk that back, saying he\u2019d only signed an executive order signaling he\u2019d invoke the DPA \u201cshould we need to invoke it in a worse case scenario in the future.\u201d</p> \n<p>Closing the border with Canada raised fresh questions over America\u2019s southern border with Mexico but was welcomed by Canada, as health officials grapple with a surge in coronavirus cases originating in US.</p> \n<p>Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said: \u201cWe\u2019re encouraging people to stay home. We\u2019re telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours if they don\u2019t absolutely have to. This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach. I want to be clear though, that essential travel will continue.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trudeau was speaking outside his home in Ottawa. For nearly a week, he has been in self-quarantine after his wife, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/sophie-gregoire-trudeau\">Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau</a>, tested positive for Covid-19.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/18/steven-mnuchin-coronavirus-unemployment-treasury-secretary\">Steven Mnuchin warns coronavirus could bring 20% unemployment</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The longest undefended land border in the world, spanning more than 5,000 miles, represents a critical lifeline for both countries, with billions in goods passing through each day. The last time the border closed was in the days after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington.</p> \n<p>Trudeau added: \u201cOur governments recognise that it is critical that we preserve supply chains between both countries. These supply chains ensure that food, fuel and life-saving medicines reach people on both sides of the border.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s decision to work with Trudeau contrasted with his earlier move to ban most travel from Europe, which was abruptly announced in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/11/donald-trump-us-coronavirus-address\">a televised Oval Office address</a> and blindsided many officials.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.wilsoncenter.org/person/christopher-sands\">Christopher Sands,</a> director of the Canada Institute at the Wilson Center think tank in Washington, said: \u201cThe most significant aspect of the decision to restrict crossings at the US-Canadian border is that it was mutual, with both Washington and Ottawa taking coordinated action that allows for essential shipments and individuals to cross.\u201d</p> \n<p>The total number of known US infections has surged past 7,000, with cases reported in all 50 states. Trump has struck a more sombre and serious tone in recent days and, on Wednesday, referred to himself as a \u201cwartime president\u201d.</p> \n<p>He told reporters: \u201cTo this day, nobody\u2019s seen anything like what they were able to do during World War II. And now it\u2019s our time. We must sacrifice together, because we are all in this together, and we\u2019ll come through together.\u201d</p> \n<p>He announced the deployment of two big hospital ships to New York and the west coast to reinforce medical services, and urged young people to make \u201csacrifices\u201d for the greater good. He also announced the Department of Housing and Urban Development would suspend all foreclosures and evictions until the end of April. Mike Pence, the vice-president, urged hospitals to <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/pence-coronavirus-elective-surgeries-delay-ed3498b4-90db-429a-9046-cb8a8d0c90cf.html\">delay elective procedures</a>.</p> \n<p>But Trump raised eyebrows when he was asked about professional sportspeople without symptoms reportedly getting tests while others are waiting in line and cannot get them. A reporter asked: \u201cDo the well-connected go to the front of the line? Should that happen?\u201d Trump replied: \u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t say so ... but perhaps that\u2019s been the story of life.\u201d</p> \n<p>The administration plans to use a health-focused statute to crack down further in swiftly removing migrants or asylum seekers who cross the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-mexico-border\">US-Mexico border</a> unlawfully.</p> \n<p>Trump said the move could happen as soon as Wednesday, but that his administration did not plan to fully close the border with Mexico.</p> \n<p>Critics have accused Trump of initially playing down the threat and providing misleading information on issues such as the availability of testing. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/donald-trump-coronavirus-politics-andrew-cuomo-gretchen-whitmer\">His claim on Tuesday</a> that \u201cI felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic,\u201d was met with widespread derision.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday the president used Twitter to defend his handling of the crisis and lashing out at media coverage. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1240243188708839424?s=20\">He posted:</a> \u201cI always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously, and have done a very good job from the beginning, including my very early decision to close the \u2018borders\u2019 from China \u2013 against the wishes of almost all. Many lives were saved. The Fake News new narrative is disgraceful &amp; false!\u201d</p> \n<p>But his brazen repetition of the phrase \u201cChinese virus\u201d in this and other tweets sparked fresh condemnation. The World Health Organization has advised against such terminology, warning that it could be \u201cstigmatising\u201d. There are fears it will fuel discrimination against Asian Americans.</p> \n<p>Asked on why he keeps using the phrase, Trump replied: \u201cBecause it comes from China. It\u2019s not racist at all, no, not at all. It comes from China, that\u2019s why, I want to be accurate\u2026</p> \n<p>\u201cI have great love for all of the people from our country but, as you know, China tried to say at one point \u2013 maybe they stopped now \u2013 that it was caused by American soldiers. That can\u2019t happen. It\u2019s not going to happen, not as long as I\u2019m president. It comes from China.\u201d</p> \n<p>But Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state defeated by Trump in the 2016 election, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/1240283608121839617?s=20\">tweeted:</a> \u201cThe president is turning to racist rhetoric to distract from his failures to take the coronavirus seriously early on, make tests widely available, and adequately prepare the country for a period of crisis.\u201d</p> \n<p>She added: \u201cDon\u2019t fall for it. Don\u2019t let your friends and family fall for it.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Reuters contributed to this report</em></p>",

It\u2019s not <strong><em>just </em></strong>because the dollar is in massive demand. </p> <p>He writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Sterling has completed one of its steepest declines in memory by hitting its weakest level since 1985, excluding if you will the brief dive of the Oct 2016 \u2018flash crash\u2019. </p> <p>This is the worst sustained period of sterling selling that I can recall, and it points to a severe dollar liquidity crunch that central banks have yet to get a grip on. There is a synchronised rush for dollars that has caught most companies, governments and traders on the hop. Dollar funding issues have been far more serious than estimated prior to this crisis.<br></p> <p>However sterling is also sharply weaker against the euro in recent days, with EURGBP above 0.92, so whilst the main reason for the pound\u2019s decline, there are clearly other factors at work. The UK government\u2019s massive fiscal package undoubtedly means more borrowing for the UK economy - how do we pay for all this? And in a rather bizarre turn of events - if you have been schooled in the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis a few years back - the euro has developed certain safe haven characteristics. Sterling is, on the other hand, a bit of a proxy for risk.<br></p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6d9a6f877ef1ce814607886fb201720f53ac5e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6d9a6f877ef1ce814607886fb201720f53ac5e7/0_0_580_342/500.jpg\" alt=\"The pound vs the US dollar this year\" width=\"500\" height=\"295\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The pound vs the US dollar this year</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Refinitiv</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e720dd28f085c6327bc2310\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T12:04:18.508Z\">12.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A growing number of European carmakers are downing tools, my colleague Rob Davies reports:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>BMW and Toyota have joined a rapidly lengthening list of carmakers shutting down European operations, affecting UK plants in Oxfordshire and Derbyshire, as the coronavirus brings the automotive industry grinding to a virtual halt.</p> <p>More than 10,000 car workers have been laid off across the industry as Nissan, the Mercedes-Benz parent, Daimler, Volkswagen, Ford, Fiat and Peugeot have already announced suspensions of their European output.

Off course this all needs to be approved by Congress, and one could argue, it probably isn\u2019t enough.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>UK supermarkets are starting to impose restrictions on shoppers. </strong>From today, Sainsbury\u2019s will also be restricting shoppers to buying a maximum of three items of any grocery product and two packets of popular items such as toilet paper, soap and UHT milk.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/17/four-items-per-shopper-restrictions-at-uk-supermarkets-as-demand-soars\">Sainsbury\u2019s to close its meat, fish and pizza service counters to free up staff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Two UK property funds froze yesterday, reflecting the slump in values of offices and warehouses - and more may follow.<br></p> <p><strong>Ryan Hughes,</strong> head of active portfolios at <strong>AJ Bell</strong>, explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> \u201cThe suspension of the Kames Property Income fund has been swiftly followed by the Janus Henderson UK Property fund also suspending on the basis of material uncertainty over the valuation of UK commercial property. </p> <p>With independent valuers finding it impossible to accurately value property given the major economic uncertainty, there is little choice but to suspend dealing.</p> </blockquote> <p>The markets are likely to remain in turmoil until there are signs that the covonavirus crisis is easing.

  "<p>Patrick Barkham asks if nature really can cure us of our mental health problems (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/14/wild-ideas-how-nature-cures-are-shaping-our-literary-landscape\" title=\"\">Green Prozac</a>, Review, 14 March). He eloquently describes how reconnecting with the natural world can help us at least recuperate and find solace in a way that our urban environments cannot. However, as Richard Mabey says in the article, it is not a panacea and nature itself is going through its own crisis; no amount of walking through silent woodlands and desertified fields will provide the sought-after cure.</p> <p>For those of us who have loved and immersed themselves in the countryside over many decades and written about it, our closeness to it can only add to our stress and worry. When I return to the lanes, hedgerows and woods I loved as a boy, where I found birds\u2019 nests every 50 yards or so, watched field mice clambering with acrobatic agility up the stems of swaying wheat and heard the mournful piping of curlews and redshank from the marshy fields, today there is only an eerie stillness and scarcely a fluttering wingbeat over the monotone greenery.</p> <p>When, in 2000, I wrote and illustrated my book Wings Over the Valley: A Birdwatcher\u2019s Wales Diary, about the joys of birdwatching and the countryside, communicating that exhilaration gave me renewed strength and optimism, but those feelings have been shattered in the face of the continued destruction of our countryside.<br><strong>John Green</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 It\u2019s good to read that highway authorities and the construction industry are taking the greening of our roadsides seriously (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/14/on-the-verge-a-quiet-roadside-revolution-is-boosting-wildflowers-aoe\" title=\"\">Flower power: the route map to a roadside revolution</a>, 14 March), but we also need to get to grips with the huge increase in paved-over front gardens.</p> <p>We may need to find a place to park cars, but the case for having a green space around our homes is very persuasive. Not only do plants and trees help keep our homes cool in summer and warm in winter, but every blade of grass also absorbs carbon dioxide and emits oxygen, thus playing a part in stopping climate change. Green spaces in residential areas are an essential stopping-off point for butterflies, birds and bees.</p> <p>The Royal Horticultural Society reports that almost a third of front gardens are now paved over.

How many of those people have they managed to track down and bring back to the UK? The Home Office conducted an extensive review into the circumstances under which those people were removed from the UK, but has not published its findings; does the report recommend full publication of the \u2018historical review of detentions and deportations\u2019?</p></li> <li><p>The Home Office has currently only investigated the people wrongly deported to the Caribbean, but has not investigated those removed to other Commonwealth countries, and has also excluded from consideration anyone with a criminal record who was wrongly removed. Does the Williams review recommend extending this research?</p></li> <li><p>How many people were wrongly sacked from their jobs, were made homeless, were denied healthcare and benefits, were prevented from travelling because the Home Office mistakenly believed they were in the UK illegally. How many people overall have been affected by this scandal?</p></li> <li><p>How much blame does the report lay on Theresa May and David Cameron, and on the changing immigration legislation from 1948 onwards which gradually shifted people who arrived perfectly legally from colonies, and later Commonwealth countries, into a precarious immigration status?</p></li> <li><p>How many warnings did May\u2019s Home Office miss about the likely impact of tightened hostile environment policies?

On Monday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/16/boris-johnson-press-conference-coronavirus-live-firms-could-soon-be-allowed-to-run-reduced-services-because-of-coronavirus-shapps-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-5e6fb2518f085e564ad852d1#block-5e6fb2518f085e564ad852d1\">he told everyone to avoid all non-essential contact with other people. </a>On Tuesday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/17/boris-johnson-coronavirus-press-conference-rishi-sunak-cabinet-as-rishi-sunak-set-to-announcing-coronavirus-financial-rescue-package-politics-live?page=with:block-5e710eb58f088d757559530b#block-5e710eb58f088d757559530b\">he and his chancellor announced a \u00a3350bn rescue plan for business</a>. And today he said that schools in England were closing, for most pupils, for the foreseeable future.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson said that schools in England would close for most pupils from Friday.</strong> And he refused to say how long the closures could last. (Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has said schools in Scotland might not reopen before the summer holidays.) He said there would be exceptions for the children of \u201ccritical workers\u201d and for vulnerable children, but he gave very little detail of who will qualify. He also said that pupils who missed out on this summer\u2019s GCSEs and A levels (also cancelled) would get the qualifications they needed for university, but he was not able to say how this would happen. Here is his opening statement on this.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I can announce today and Gavin Williamson making statement now in House of Commons that after schools shut their gates from Friday afternoon, they will remain closed for most pupils \u2013 for the vast majority of pupils- until further notice. I will explain what I mean by the vast majority of pupils.</p> \n   <p>The objective is to slow the spread of the virus and we judge it is the right moment to do that.</p> \n   <p>But of course, as I\u2019ve always said, we also need to keep the NHS going and to treat the number of rising cases. So we need health workers who are also parents to continue to go to work. And we need other critical workers with children to keep doing their jobs too \u2013 from police officers who are keeping us safe to the supermarket delivery drivers, social care workers who look after the elderly and who are so vital. We will be setting out more details shortly about who we mean in these groups.</p> \n   <p>So we therefore need schools to make provision for the children of these key workers who would otherwise be forced to stay home. And they will also need to look after the most vulnerable children.</p> \n   <p>This will mean there will of course be are far fewer children in schools and that will help us to slow the spread of the disease. And these measures are crucial to make sure the critical parts of the economy keep functioning and public services keep functioning.</p> \n   <p>So we are simultaneously asking nurseries and private schools to do the same, and we are providing financial support where it is needed. We are making provisions to supply meals and vouchers for children eligible for free school meals. And where some schools are already doing this, I want to make it clear we will reimburse the cost. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson refused to rule out introducing tighter self-isolation rules for London</strong>. There have been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e8c98d1c-6926-11ea-a3c9-1fe6fedcca75\">reports claiming a virtual lock-down in the capital is planned for the weekend.</a>Johnson did nothing to play down these suggestions, and instead he repeatedly stressed his willingness to go \u201cfurther and faster\u201d. In response to one question on this, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We\u2019ve always said that we are going to do the right measures at the right time.</p> \n   <p>Actually I think a lot of people are taking a real heroic effort to comply with the advice we\u2019ve given but as I\u2019ve said tonight, and in the past few days, we keep everything under continuous review and we will not hesitate in bringing forward further and faster measures where we think that is necessary.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He implied that people ignoring the government advice given on Monday to limit social contact were putting lives at risk.</strong> He declined an invitation to call these people immoral. But, in response to the question, he used probably his strongest language to date on this theme. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Of course people must make their own decisions, I\u2019m a believer as I say in freedom. </p> \n   <p>But let\u2019s be absolutely in no doubt that these are very, very important choices that we are now making in our daily lives and the more closely and the more strictly, more ruthlessly, we can enforce upon ourselves, our families the advice we are getting, then the better we will be able to protect our NHS, the fewer deaths we will have and the less suffering there will be in the UK population. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said he had \u201cno intention\u201d of changing the law that rules out an extension of the Brexit transition. </strong>(See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/18/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-pmqs-cbi-urges-government-pay-businesses-directly-saying-350bn-loangrant-package-not-enough?page=with:block-5e725dda8f085c6327bc279b#block-5e725dda8f085c6327bc279b\"> 5.47pm.) </a>That is not the same as saying an extension will never happen, and his language will not dispel the widespread suspicions that an extension will now be inevitable.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He hinted that the government is planning bail-outs for struggling companies.</strong> (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/18/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-pmqs-cbi-urges-government-pay-businesses-directly-saying-350bn-loangrant-package-not-enough?page=with:block-5e725d268f088d7575595e99#block-5e725d268f088d7575595e99\"> 5.42pm.)</a></li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"001b6fe86ac874f20cc292009a667699928178aa\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/001b6fe86ac874f20cc292009a667699928178aa/0_22_3200_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson gestures during a news conference regarding the coronavirus, in Downing Street.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson gestures during a news conference regarding the coronavirus, in Downing Street.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eddie Mulholland/AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7267018f085c6327bc2821\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T18:23:50.698Z\">6.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The government will introduce emergency legislation to ban evictions for three months to help protect renters, Sky News reports.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SkyNewsBreak/status/1240339227646328833\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick says the Government will introduce emergency legislation to suspend new evictions from social or private rented accommodation \"during this national emergency\" amid the COVID-19 outbreak</p>\u2014 Sky News Breaking (@SkyNewsBreak) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SkyNewsBreak/status/1240339227646328833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 18, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7261318f088d7575595edc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/richardadams\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T18:01:06.318Z\">6.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Education secretary <strong>Gavin Williamson</strong> told the Commons: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>After schools shut their gates on Friday afternoon they will remain closed until further notice this will be for all children, except to those of key workers and where children who are most vulnerable.</p> \n   <p>The scientific advice shows that the settings are safe for this small number of children to continue attending.

On Wednesday, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, told parliament: \u201cWe will be bringing forward legislation to protect private renters from eviction.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Shelter said that it has been contacted by one renter who works at an NHS hospital who said their landlord wanted to evict them and the other tenants in the property, some of whom also work at the hospital, because he fears contracting the virus from them. The landlord reportedly added that unless a cure in found in the next few weeks, they will have to leave.</p> \n  <p>Another renter was illegally evicted while on holiday in <strong>Italy</strong> without notice after the landlord said they were worried they would catch the virus. The tenant offered to self-isolate for 14 days elsewhere before returning to the property, but the landlord still refused, Shelter said. The cases emerged from the charity\u2019s online help service and could not be verified by the Guardian.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Tens of thousands of renters face being turfed out of their home in the next six months if the government fails to act quickly,\u201d said Polly Neate, chief executive at Shelter. \u201cWe need a wholesale and complete halt to all evictions while the coronavirus crisis unfolds. The government has stepped to in to support mortgagees and it must now act decisively to help renters survive the current storm. It must legislate immediately to halt all eviction proceedings during this period of social disruption.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Renters\u2019 organisation Generation Rent said almost two-thirds of renters have no savings, at least 2 million live in houses of multiple occupation putting them at higher risk of contracting the virus, and there are 1.1m self-employed heads of households who rent their homes, who are at a high risk of losing work as a result of coronavirus. </p> \n  <p>Caitlin Wilkinson, policy manager at the campaign group, said: <br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We know that many landlords will take action to evict tenants, leaving them homeless in the midst of a pandemic.

I know Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, and Patrick Vallance. I have the utmost respect for both. They have had the services of some of the most talented researchers in the world to draw on. But somehow there was a collective failure among politicians and perhaps even government experts to recognise the signals that Chinese and Italian scientists were sending.

The tone was always going to serious and sombre given the nature of the crisis facing the country. (Every single question was about coronavirus, by my count.) But the effect of holding it in a near-empty chamber also made a difference because there was no cheering or barracking. Boris Johnson had no noise cushion to help him through. It meant that what he said mattered more.</p> \n  <p>Johnson was pressed repeatedly, especially by Jeremy Corbyn, by Ian Blackford and most effectively of all by Chris Byrant, on what he was doing to help workers who will lose out from coronavirus and he was on slightly shaky ground. Ministers insist they will announce a package of employment support measures very soon, and Johnson repeatedly insisted that people should not lose out for doing the right thing (ie, for staying at home, even if they feel well) and he repeatedly said that he was willing to do whatever it took. To some extent, that still sounded more like a slogan than a strategy.</p> \n  <p>But PMQs should also been an opportunity for the prime minister to listen, as well as to communicate, and one would imagine than Johnson would have left the chamber more persuaded than ever about the need for some mass government intervention to protect workers. If Felicity Buchan, a Kensington Tory with a background in banking, is saying that the government does not need to worry about borrowing any more (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/18/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-pmqs-cbi-urges-government-pay-businesses-directly-saying-350bn-loangrant-package-not-enough?page=with:block-5e7213bc8f085e564ad865ee#block-5e7213bc8f085e564ad865ee\">12.29pm</a>), then it is hard to see what is restraining No 10.</p> \n  <p>Johnson has a proper announcement to make during the session. In response to a question from Corbyn, he confirmed that the government would legislate to protect renters from eviction during the coronavirus crisis. He told MPs:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I can indeed confirm that we will be bringing forward legislation to protect private renters from eviction, that is one thing we will do, but it is also important as we legislate that we do not simply pass on the problem, so we\u2019ll also be taking steps to protect other actors in the economy.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Johnson also announced that coronavirus testing was being ramped up to 25,000 tests a day. And, although he did not reveal what the government\u2019s employment support measures would involve, his answers on this were intriguing. He did not dismiss out of hand the temporary universal basis income idea floated by Blackford, or Bryant\u2019s call for a handout in the form of a summer version of the winter fuel payment.</p> \n  <p>Johnson was also interesting on the subject of schools. He told MPs:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The house should expect further decisions to be taken imminently on schools and how to make sure we square the circle both of making sure we stop the spread of the disease but also making sure we relieve, as much as we can, pressure on our NHS.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>That sounded very much like a hint that the government will announce a partial closure of schools, with some provision being kept open - perhaps for children of key workers, or perhaps with schools in childminding rather than education mode? - to minimise the impact on the NHS.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T13:26:14.986Z\">at 1.26pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7216cc8f088d7575595abd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/harrietsherwood\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T13:22:01.644Z\">1.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The <strong>Catholic church</strong> in <strong>England</strong> and <strong>Wales</strong> is suspending services from Friday until further notice. </p> \n  <p>A letter from Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the archbishop of Westminster, says: \u201cIn response to the coronavirus pandemic, so many aspects of our lives must change.

Alex Marshall, chair of the IWGB Couriers and Logistics branch, said: <br><br>\u201cDeliveroo and other so-called gig economy employers have to stop blocking their workers\u2019 access to these funds and immediately introduce full contractual sick pay, without pre-conditions. <br><br>\u201cIncreasingly, these workers are being expected to play a huge role in feeding people during this time of crisis, so it is time for their employers and the government to give them the basic rights we expect in any decent and just society.\u201d<br><br>The Guardian has contacted Deliveroo for comment. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e721a298f085c6327bc23ea\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T13:02:04.610Z\">1.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In these unusual times, with social distancing, working from home and self-isolation taking effect the world over, sales of sex toys appear to have seen an uplift. </p> \n  <p>Stats suggest <strong>UK</strong> sales are up 13%, whilst in <strong>Canada</strong> they have soared by 135% and by 71% in <strong>Italy</strong>.</p> \n  <p>Perhaps our G2 commissioning editor puts it best:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisPJGodfrey/status/1240244055730278401\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Just read a press release claiming that Covid-19 has seen sex toy sales shoot up by 135% in Canada and 71% in Italy.

Of course that wasn\u2019t his intention, but that is a consequence of the way the government has been trying to adjust its advice for particular groups without being overly prescriptive.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e71e7a88f088d7575595888\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T09:25:19.394Z\">9.25am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sainsbury's announces elderly-only shopping hour</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Sainsbury\u2019s is the latest supermarket to announce measures to help the elderly and vulnerable during the ongoing coronavirus crisis.

Like the CBI, it thinks the chancellor needs to go further. This is from <strong>Paul Johnson,</strong> the IFS\u2019s director.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The support through business rates holidays and payments is targeted directly at the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors many of which will be suffering a lot, especially in light of yesterday\u2019s new announcements discouraging people from patronising such businesses. This is a substantial level of support. However, it is probably not well targeted at saving jobs in those industries. It will remain as expensive to pay people and if demand is down then jobs are likely to go. Supporting employment might require a targeted package which included targeted cuts to employer national insurance contributions, a delay in increases to the national living wage, and increased support for individuals through universal credit. Government might also want to facilitate people being able to move into jobs where there is now much greater demand \u2013 delivery drivers and warehouse workers for example \u2013 in a way which allows them to return easily to their original jobs once the crisis is over.</p> \n   <p>Firms outside the leisure and hospitality sector have not been targeted with this additional direct support.

As Heather Stewart reports <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/17/rishi-sunak-pledges-350bn-to-tackle-coronavirus-impact\">in the Guardian\u2019s overnight splash, </a>Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, yesterday announced a \u00a3350bn package of loans and grants (\u00a3330bn in loan guarantees, \u00a320bn in grants and other handouts) to help businesses struggling as the economy grinds to a halt. Judging by today\u2019s front pages, national newspaper coverage is generally positive, but this morning the CBI, the country\u2019s biggest business organisation, joined the Labour party in saying this did not go far enough.</p> \n  <p>In an interview with the Today programme <strong>Carolyn Fairbairn</strong>, the CBI director general, said Sunak had announced a \u201cserious and massive package of measures\u201d, but she said firms needed help now to allow them to keep people in work. She said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The absolute top priority right now is for businesses to be able to keep their people in jobs, in employment, and we think there needs to be more on that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Fairbairn said the CBI wanted the government to use the national insurance system to pump money into companies. Instead of paying national insurance, they would get a cheque for \u201creverse national insurance\u201d from the government. She explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This is about using existing systems, it\u2019s all about speed. So the thought that we have put to the chancellor is to reverse national insurance contributions - not just defer or cancel them, but actually get the flow working in the other direction.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Fairbairn said a similar system was operating in Germany.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have a very well functioning national insurance system; reverse it, to enable businesses to make that judgment about whether to keep people or not keep them. This will be a very quick measures to introduce.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>She also suggested that VAT bills should be deferred.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There are some very large tax bills hitting companies in the next few weeks. We have a \u00a335bn VAT bill. This is an immediate impact; it doesn\u2019t require businesses to apply for anything. So looking at the tax bills, and seeing if they can be cancelled or deferred.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This will not come as a surprise to Sunak, who said yesterday that he would be announcing employment support measures and that he was still working on the details with employers and unions. This morning <strong>Alok Sharma</strong>, the business secretary, said this would be ready \u201cvery soon\u201d.</p> \n  <p>From today Politics Live will be a bit different because we will be covering all UK coronavirus developments here, and not just Westminster politics.

  "<p>The development geographer Sylvia Chant, who has died aged 60 of pancreatic cancer, challenged the idea that households headed by women were automatically more likely to live in poverty than those headed by men.</p> <p>When she began her research in the 1980s, much other research and policymaking portrayed households headed by women in the developing world as poverty-ridden. Sylvia argued that it was not necessarily poverty in itself that disadvantaged women in cities of the global south, but rather their multiple household responsibilities and obligations in relation to men.</p> <p>Her fieldwork in Mexico, Costa Rica, the Philippines and the Gambia showed that measuring the incidence of poverty through measuring the number of households headed by women was inaccurate.</p> <p>In her books <a href=\"https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9780230378049\" title=\"\">Women-headed Households</a> (1997) and <a href=\"https://www.e-elgar.com/shop/gbp/gender-generation-and-poverty-9781843769927.html\" title=\"\">Gender, Generation and Poverty</a> (2007) she demonstrated that such households were more numerous than is usually assumed, but also could provide women with autonomy and freedom. She recounted numerous stories of how women who headed households and their daughters were much more likely to go out to work as they were free from the control of husbands and fathers who often forbade women from entering the labour market.</p> <p>Even though these women were able to make their own decisions, she also highlighted the dangerous tendency for them to take on multiple responsibilities inside and outside the home, balancing domestic and paid work.</p> <p>Sylvia really engaged with the women \u2013 and to a lesser extent, men \u2013 whom she interviewed and kept in touch with many of them years after her first encounters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"396a4d08801520b5ba0033ad6d5f4277b2459f67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/396a4d08801520b5ba0033ad6d5f4277b2459f67/0_0_968_1219/794.jpg\" alt=\"Sylvia Chant at the Dropping of the Knife campaign in Wassu, the Gambia, in 2013\" width=\"794\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sylvia Chant at the Dropping of the Knife campaign in Wassu, the Gambia, in 2013</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: none</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Keen to work with other researchers, she co-authored and edited 11 of her 18 books, including four that we wrote together, of which the most recent was <a href=\"https://www.environmentandurbanization.org/cities-slums-and-gender-global-south-towards-feminised-urban-future\" title=\"\">Cities, Slums and Gender in the Global South</a> (2016).

For example, she co-authored the UN-Habitat report <a href=\"http://www.zaragoza.es/contenidos/medioambiente/onu/994-eng.pdf\" title=\"\">State of Women in Cities 2012-13</a>, arguing for acknowledgment that cities everywhere had large numbers of female-headed households and that gender issues must be taken into account in urban planning if cities are to prosper in the future.</p> <p>Her work with the <a href=\"http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/57870/\" title=\"\">Gambia Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children</a> contributed to the country\u2019s final outlawing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/female-genital-mutilation\" title=\"\">female genital mutilation</a> in 2015.</p> <p>Born in Dundee, Sylvia was the daughter of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/jun/16/stuart-chant-obituary\">Stuart Chant</a>, a microbiologist, and his wife, June (nee McCartney), a legal secretary. She grew up in London and attended Lady Margaret school in Parsons Green and, for the sixth form, Kingston College. She gained a geography degree (1981) at <a href=\"https://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">King\u2019s College, Cambridge</a>, where she developed her feminist approach to her life and work.</p> <p>This led to her PhD at University College London in 1984, supervised by Peter Ward and <a href=\"https://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/people/emeritus/alan-gilbert\" title=\"\">Alan Gilbert</a>, studying <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272929299_Family_Formation_and_Female_Roles_in_Queretaro_Mexico\" title=\"\">the role of women in the construction of housing in Quer\u00e9taro, Mexico</a>. This was among the first studies that recognised women as key actors in self-build housing in poor urban communities in countries of the global south.</p> <p>Following a postdoctoral position at UCL, and a year at the University of Liverpool, in 1988 Sylvia moved to the LSE. She worked in its department of geography and the environment and in conjunction with its gender institute (now department) for the rest of her career.</p> <p>Her first book, Women in the Third World (1989, with <a href=\"https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/dasa/brydon-lynne.aspx\" title=\"\">Lynne Brydon</a>), argued for the importance of analysing women\u2019s roles in rural and urban areas of the global south, drawing on voices and interpretations from the grassroots rather than crude statistical analyses. <a href=\"https://www.developmentbookshelf.com/doi/book/10.3362/9780855987916\" title=\"\">Mainstreaming Men into Gender and Development</a> (2000, with <a href=\"https://watson.brown.edu/people/faculty-fellows/gutmann\" title=\"\">Matthew Gutmann</a>) argued for the importance of including men in gender and development debates and projects, suggesting that genuine feminist transformation would not be possible without such engagements, while ensuring that women were not re-excluded.</p> <p>Sylvia\u2019s research also shed light on countries such as Costa Rica and the Gambia, where limited research on gender issues had previously been undertaken. In Costa Rica, she worked in the province of Guanacaste, traditionally associated with cattle ranching and tourism, to show that women\u2019s lives in small towns were dominated by short-term out-migration of men to work in seasonal agriculture and that it was women who were the bastions of households and communities.</p> <p>In the Gambia, in contrast to much research that focuses on sex tourism, she worked not only on FGM but also on gender and youth and how school enrolments alone did little to ensure that young women were able to develop personal freedom and decent employment in later life; this would only be possible with educational policies that integrated gender equity into curriculum development.</p> <p>After a first marriage that ended in divorce, in 2002 Sylvia married Chris Mogridge; he survives her, along with her mother, June, and two sisters, Adrienne and Yvonne.</p> <p>\u2022 Sylvia Hamilton Chant, development geographer, born 24 December 1958; died 18 December 2019</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Powis Castle Gardens</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/powis-castle-and-garden\" title=\"\">Powis</a> is a pocket battleship among great Welsh houses. Its red stone walls rise like a medieval apparition on a hill overlooking the upper Severn. It was the citadel of the Welsh Marches, five miles from the English border. Its princes were a devious bunch, never knowing on whose side they stood between England and Wales. Today their fortress, normally open to the public, stands guard over the valleys leading into once-impenetrable Wales. Round it over the centuries, successive Herberts have laid out the most extraordinary terraced gardens in Britain. Clipped yews tumble down the hillside, apparently gone berserk, spilling over walls and balustrades. Between them are buried rich herbaceous borders. It is like Kew Gardens tilted 45 degrees. To one side a formal Edwardian parterre tries to pretend Powis has been tamed. Mercifully it has not. Views from the terraces are spectacular, looking out over the lush hills and meadows of the Severn valley. But behind still lurk the dark forests of Wales. The castle, cafe and shop are closed but the gardens will remain open from 10am-4pm.

They are both currently closed but the 500-acre estate with its brilliant walks, which link to Knole Park to the west, remains open. And the beauty is that many routes lead around the gardens and house, so it\u2019s easy to peep at the enchanting scenes behind the ancient walls, particularly as the car park is also still open. My favourite walk starts at One Tree Hill, another NT beauty spot just outside the estate, taking in spectacular Wilmot Hill, Victorian hoppers\u2019 huts in a distinctly wet secret valley and mysterious Scathes Wood. Turtle doves purr, bluebells, wood anemones and primroses sparkle on the woodland floor and the paths along the south-facing scarp are alive with brimstone, peacock and orange-tip butterflies enjoying this sheltered, sunny spot.<br><strong>Adam McCulloch</strong></p> <h2><strong>Ashridge Estate, Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2a6a0ff26b8f7ea2ab3ccf2df4a5a50c3e8fb1f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a6a0ff26b8f7ea2ab3ccf2df4a5a50c3e8fb1f8/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pathway through a bluebell wood\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>With 5,000 acres of ancient woodland on the Hertfordshire-Buckinghamshire border, <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/ashridge-estate\" title=\"\">Ashridge</a> offers 80 miles of designated footpaths, bridle paths and bike trails, though the visitor centre and shop are now closed.

The blue cassocks are long gone, but in spring the forest is cloaked in bluebells and wild garlic. Fallow deer, introduced by the monks, are easily spotted. Ashridge is a nationally important site for ancient and veteran trees. An ancient yew starred in Harry Potter, and the woods, with fake snow added, were used in the 2012 Les Mis\u00e9rables film.

The parkland, all woods, peaceful glades and glens, is home to a small herd of red deer and llamas, and rejuvenating walks here are made easy by 17 miles of pathways. Best of all, though, is the cool and head-clearing beach: three miles of cliffs, bays and shore, and therapeutic views over the Firth of Clyde to Arran. Rock pooling for ghost prawns and starfish is fun here, and there are history-laden cliffside caves, once lived in by people during the Neolithic age.

In the second world war it was a secret RAF airbase (the fascinating museum telling the story is still open, as is everything else on the estate except the cafe, though that may change soon). It\u2019s second claim to fame is that the grand landscaped gardens were Capability Brown\u2019s first large-scale commission, in 1751. The landscape designer swept away the unproductive marshland \u2013 and the village that spoilt the view from Croome Court \u2013 and replaced it with acres of natural-looking parkland, with views to the Malvern Hills in the west.

One of my favourite views in Cornwall can be found at Loe Bar, the improbably narrow shingle bank that separates the Loe from the sea. Standing between the two you look into two separate, and wholly beautiful, worlds. On one side, heavy Atlantic seas pound the sand and on the other, the dense woodland around the pool is calm and sheltered, an oasis in turbulent times. I can lose whole days wandering along the miles of isolated, winding pathways around the Loe through marshes, woodland and lakeside, which has a rare, unspoiled feel to it, as no water sports are allowed at any time. When I\u2019m feeling energetic, though, I cover the same ground in a couple of hours, running around the lake and making use of the outdoor gym equipment the National Trust has helpfully placed at intervals along the path.</p> <p>I\u2019m not the first writer to have been drawn in by the charms of the Penrose estate. Wilkie Collins raved about the Loe in his 1861 travel book, <a href=\"https://www.wilkie-collins.info/books_rambles.htm\">Rambles Beyond Railways</a>, in which he wrote: \u2018No fairy vision of Nature that was ever imagined is more fantastic, or more lovely than this glorious reality.\u2019 And, more recently, the estate inspired Xan Brooks\u2019 altogether grittier novella, <a href=\"https://shop.nationaltrust.org.uk/savage-lovely-cornish-homes.html\">Savage Lovely Cornish Homes</a>, which was published by National Trust Books last year, and which may provide an alternative dip into the Loe for those unable to make it to Cornwall. I will be heading out for walks here with my children in the coming weeks where, if we\u2019re lucky (and quiet), we\u2019ll see herons, otters and deer. In the event we don\u2019t (we\u2019re rarely that quiet), we will retell stories inspired by this beautiful place, of King Arthur throwing Excalibur into the lake, and the giant Jan Tregeagle of Cornish mythology, who created Loe Bar when he dropped his bag of sand while being chased by the devil.<br><strong>Wyl Menmuir</strong></p> <h2><strong>Studley Royal, North Yorkshire</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24347e096c03955eff4b30bd2d3def21f2351664\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24347e096c03955eff4b30bd2d3def21f2351664/0_182_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Footbridge ove the River Skell in the grounds of Studley Royal\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When I want to see big trees in wide open spaces, which is quite often these days, I head for <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/fountains-abbey-and-studley-royal-water-garden\" title=\"\">Studley</a>.

The latter is still open and is magnificent: an 18th-century manmade wilderness with river canyon, lake and sinuous mini-dales where you might encounter some of the estate\u2019s deer, but people are usually few and far between. A disgraced ex-chancellor of the exchequer, John Aislabie, who set about landscaping the grounds of the former abbey. He had time on his hands after a spell in prison for what the House of Commons investigators called \u201cinfamous corruption\u201d. Whatever his crimes, his penance is a worthy one.

There are venerable old oaks and a 134-foot Japanese redwood, said to be the tallest example in the UK. Birds flicker through the mid-canopy and bugs populate the undergrowth. Otters are occasionally spotted.</p> <p>Like so many bucolic places in this part of Wales, Colby has played a role in the region\u2019s industrial history.

  "<p>An investigation into the causes of the Windrush scandal has been completed and presented to the UK home secretary, who plans to make it public on Thursday. </p> <p>The investigation is expected to be very critical of Home Office staff and successive government ministers, and is likely to focus on the \u201chostile environment\u201d immigration policy introduced by Theresa May when she was home secretary, and the role of institutionalised racial discrimination.</p> <p>The Windrush Lessons Learned review was commissioned by Sajid Javid as home secretary weeks after the scandal came to public attention following a series of articles in the Guardian in April 2018.</p> <p>Wendy Williams, an inspector of constabulary, has been working on the report for about 20 months. She had been expected to submit it in the autumn but its completion was delayed by a process known as Maxwellisation, which allows for any individuals criticised in an official report to respond before its publication.</p> <p>The scandal arose after the Home Office wrongly designated thousands of legal UK residents as being in the country illegally. Some were mistakenly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/14/scale-misery-devastating-inside-story-reporting-windrush-scandal\">deported</a> to countries they had left as children about 50 years earlier, and others were wrongly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/20/its-inhumane-the-windrush-victims-who-have-lost-jobs-homes-and-loved-ones\">detained</a> in immigration removal centres. Many lost their jobs after being told they did not have the right to work in the UK and were later denied benefits, leaving them destitute. Many were made homeless, denied NHS treatment and prevented from travelling.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/27/home-office-windrush-report-damns-hostile-environment-policy\">Leaked</a> versions of an early draft of the report stated that the Home Office had failed in its legal duty to counter racial discrimination when it implemented its anti-immigration \u201chostile environment\u201d programme. That draft accused officials of recklessness, defensiveness and a reluctance to acknowledge and learn from their mistakes. However, the final report is likely to have evolved considerably from the earlier version leaked in 2019.</p> <p>May introduced a series of \u201chostile environment\u201d policies under which she sought to make life intolerable for people who had entered the UK illegally, in an effort to cut immigration numbers during her time as home secretary.</p> <p>The Home Office was warned that these policies would adversely affect many people who were living here entirely legally, but officials appear not to have paid sufficient attention to those warnings. Williams\u2019s review focuses on the impact of immigration laws from that period.</p> <p>Williams urged the current home secretary, Priti Patel, to publish the review as soon as possible. </p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe expect to publish the report and its findings tomorrow, subject to parliamentary time.\u201d </p> <p>There has been concern from some of those affected by the scandal that the report may not get the attention it needs if it is published during this period of national crisis.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/19/windrush-generation-tell-of-holidays-that-led-to-exile-and-heartbreak\">Winston Robinson</a>, who arrived from Jamaica aged nine in 1966, was sacked from his job as an ambulance driver in 2016 because he had no passport, and later became homeless. He said: \u201cI hope that the report recognises that people\u2019s lives were turned upside down, and accepts the damage that was done and the mistakes that were made. I\u2019m worried that it is going to be put on the backburner because of everything else that\u2019s going on.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/09/special-needs-teacher-uk-50-years-loses-job-immigration-status\">Michael Braithwaite</a>, 68, arrived with his family from Barbados in 1961, aged eight. He lost his job as a special needs teaching assistant after the primary school where he had worked for more than 15 years deemed him an illegal immigrant, despite the fact he had lived in the UK for more than 50 years. He said he hoped the report reflected the magnitude of what went wrong. \u201cPeople who did nothing wrong died; others are still destitute. I\u2019m still suffering, wondering: am I really safe here?\u201d</p> <p>Since the scandal emerged, more than 8,000 people have been given documentation proving that they are \u2013 and always were \u2013 living legally in the UK. A compensation scheme has been set up with an estimated budget of between \u00a3200m and \u00a3570m, but at the last count only \u00a362,198 of compensation had been paid out, shared between 36 people.</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe are grateful to Wendy Williams for submitting her independent review to the Home Secretary.</p> <p>\u201cWe expect to publish the report and its findings tomorrow, subject to parliamentary time.\u201d</p>",

So far, 17,361 people having been infected nationwide.</p> <p>Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, defended his government\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak on Wednesday, after facing widespread criticism that officials acted too slowly and may have even covered up initial cases before infections rapidly spread across the country.</p> <p>In a speech to his cabinet, Rouhani said the government was \u201cstraightforward\u201d with the nation, saying it announced the outbreak as soon as it learned about it on 19 February. \u201cWe spoke to people in a honest way. We had no delay,\u201d he added.</p> <p>The Iranian government finally closed religious sites and mosques this week after weeks of criticism. \u201cIt was difficult of course to shut down mosques and holy sites, but we did it. It was a religious duty to do it,\u201d Rouhani said.</p> <p>It comes as a report from Iran\u2019s Sharif University states that if Iranians did not cooperate with government guidelines the outbreak is likely to peak in June and cause 3.5 million deaths.</p> <h2>Belgium locks down</h2> <p>Belgium is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-live-news-updates-outbreak-us-states-uk-australia-europe-eu-self-isolation-lockdown-latest-update?page=with:block-5e71fdf88f085c6327bc2270#block-5e71fdf88f085c6327bc2270\">latest country to go into lockdown</a>, with citizens asked to stay at home and limit contact to their closest family.</p> <p>From noon local time (CET) on Wednesday, all non-essential shops and open-air markets closed and people will be expected to work at home.

  "<p>\u2018There\u2019s four things in life I hate: scroungers, foreigners, doctors and posh people.\u201d These aren\u2019t the words of 1970s National Front supporters; this is Kate Abbott, the prejudiced protagonist of the new ITV sitcom <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=132511868183853\">Kate &amp; Koji</a>, a show so distasteful and dated that watching it is like looking into a time-capsule montage of Britain\u2019s finest moments of racial prejudice.</p> <p>The storyline is simple: Abbott, a seaside cafe owner played by Brenda Blethyn, likes her England and her customers \u201ctraditional\u201d, but her world is disrupted with the sudden arrival of asylum-seeking doctor Koji, a besuited Jimmy Akingbola, speaking in a thick Nigerian-referencing accent (although he is only referred to as being \u201cfrom Africa\u201d).</p> <p>In the two episodes made available for critics to view in advance, the pair get off to a rocky start as Koji uses the cafe as a haven from his temporary accommodation, nursing a single cup of tea in his pristine three-piece, while Kate laments his status as a \u201cscrounger\u201d, living off her hard-earned wages. When it becomes apparent that Koji is a trained doctor but cannot work here while he is seeking asylum, the pair strike up an agreement of free food for Koji in return for informal consultations, which bring in more cafe customers. Happy days: Koji gets to eat and Kate gets to have her icy prejudices slowly thawed by his unwavering good nature and illegal practice. It\u2019s as if the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/22/good-immigrant-review-nikesh-shukla-britain-racist\">Good Immigrant had never been published</a>.</p> <p>Filmed in front of a live audience on a cafe stage set, the show\u2019s claustrophobic aesthetics, kitsch slapstick and jarringly loud laughter hark back to the likes of Open All Hours and Dad\u2019s Army, as well as more recent iterations of the multi-camera format in Mrs Brown\u2019s Boys or Miranda. Even the Baker Street-style saxophone melody and panning opening credits feel like a throwback to Only Fools and Horses.</p> <p>Of course, the retro references are intentional, even tongue-in-cheek, yet if the premise and setting feel dated, the writing should surely serve to cannily subvert this. Instead, the the script is more stale than the cafe\u2019s beige wallpaper; a bland pastiche leaning so heavily on stereotypes as to make every character a caricature: the prejudiced old-timer, the good immigrant, the village idiots.</p> <p>The groan-worthy jokes include jibes at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/meera-syal\">Meera Syal</a>\u2019s doctor ordering a flat white with oat milk (only the metropolitan liberal elite drink coffee); a (presumably foreign) call-centre worker mispronouncing Kate\u2019s name; and a particularly egregious one-liner on multi-gendered toilets that gets one of the loudest laughs of the second episode. In fact, both sides lose in this sloppy writing; Kate\u2019s character is so poorly drawn as to make her a personification of a progressive\u2019s nightmares, while Koji is so formal and austere as to make him a version of Morgan Freeman\u2019s Hoke in Driving Miss Daisy. There is little space for Bleythyn\u2019s formidable talent to shine, nor are there nuances enough for Akingbola to humanise his portrayal of Koji.</p> <p>Created by the writing team behind the deft family comedy Outnumbered \u2013 Andy Hamilton and Guy Jenkin \u2013 it seems that tackling anything beyond middle-class domestic life has proved too much for them. At best, Kate &amp; Koji scrapes close to Channel 4\u2019s toothless take on the Syrian refugee influx, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/mar/05/home-review-syrian-refugee-sitcom-struggles-to-spin-comedy-gold\">Home</a>. At worst, it brings to mind the offensive stereotyping of Love Thy Neighbour and Mind Your Language, two 1970s sitcoms that tried to tackle racial culture-clash with unsympathetic, clumsily racist, overtones.</p> <p>Why is ITV funding a modern-day rehash of shows that, even in their prime half a century ago, were noted for their insensitivity and narrow-sightedness? There have been far better, more nuanced portrayals recently on our screens. Take <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/apr/17/ramy-review-sharp-comedy-series-examines-muslim-american-life\">Ramy</a>, an ingenious look at being a young Muslim in America, written by one \u2013 Ramy Youssef \u2013 or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/apr/09/dont-forget-the-driver-review-the-refugee-crisis-hits-bognor-in-superb-sadcom\">Don\u2019t Forget the Driver</a>, a BBC Two tragicomedy where Toby Jones plays a coach driver who comes upon a Calais stowaway.</p> <p>In these shows, diversity is a human, tangible part of the fabric of everyday life, even if it is contested and difficult. It is not an exotic occurrence that magically lands on the doorstep of your cafe, asking to be let in.</p> <p>\u2022 Kate and Koji is on tonight, 8pm, ITV</p>",

  "<p>In some of the most dangerously overcrowded Greek refugee camps, it has become a race against time to raise awareness about Covid-19 and ensure an outbreak does not spread among an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/child-killed-in-lesbos-refugee-camp-fire\">already vulnerable population</a>.</p> <p>In the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jan/17/moria-is-a-hell-new-arrivals-describe-life-in-a-greek-refugee-camp\">infamous Moria camp</a> on the island of Lesbos close to 20,000 people live in a space designed for just under 3,000.</p> <p>There is is already limited access to running water in the camp, and toilets and showers regularly block due to overuse. The first case of Covid-19 was confirmed on the island last week when a Greek woman from the town of Plomari tested positive. So far this the only confirmed case on the island.</p> <p>There is an increasing sense of urgency in Moria about hygiene and handwashing. In the absence of support from the Greek authorities, residents are taking matters into their own hands.</p> <p>\u201cThe conditions were out of control and so we knew that we needed to do something by ourselves,\u201d said Deen Mohammad Alizadah, 30, originally from Afghanistan.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/18/ngos-raise-alarm-as-coronavirus-strips-support-from-eu-refugees\">NGOs raise alarm as coronavirus strips support from EU refugees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Alizadah is one of the residents who have come together to create an awareness team. \u201cThe only thing that can control the virus here is the management of people and making them aware,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The members of the team are a snapshot of the diverse population of Moria, heralding from countries such as Syria, Afghanistan, Eritrea and the Congo region, each dispensing advice to their own communities. The team has already swelled to 50 people, with more joining by the day. Megaphones are being distributed to help spread the word about the importance of hygiene and washing.</p> <p>Due to high demand, face masks are currently in short supply in pharmacies in the local town of Mytilene, and since there is no current mass distribution of masks to the camp, industrious Moria residents have come up with their own solution. </p> <p>In a small building around a kilometre from Moria, a group of four Afghan women have volunteered their time to sew face masks for the camp\u2019s population. Stand By Me Lesvos, a Greek NGO, realised that they could make use of the sewing machines from a previous project. </p> <p>\u201cIt was set up within six hours on Friday,\u201d said Mixalis Avialotis from Stand By Me Lesvos. \u201cOne of the Afghan women used to be a tailor in Kabul and said she\u2019d have no problem managing the operation.\u201d </p> <p>The women are working at a rapid rate and in their first day made approximately 500 masks, which are fashioned from cotton fabric bought from local shops. The masks are then packaged into plastic wrappers purchased from the local Lidl supermarket and boxed to be brought to the camp. The masks, which will be given out for free, will initially only be distributed to camp residents who start to feel unwell or exhibit symptoms of the virus, such as a cough.</p> <p>Once worn, the masks will then be boiled and sterilised so that, if necessary, they can be reused.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d9749e779934de9a20d0241a5e1357f7a6e53e4c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9749e779934de9a20d0241a5e1357f7a6e53e4c/0_0_960_1280/750.jpg\" alt=\"Posters made by children in the overcrowded Vathy refugee camp on Samos.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Posters made by children in the Vathy refugee camp on Samos are part of an effort to combat overcrowded and unhygienic conditions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Still I Rise NGO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Avialotis estimates that they have now made around 1,500 masks and said that social distancing and other Covid-19-mitigating measures have also been implemented inside the factory.\u201c</p> <p>On the island of Samos where the refugee camp hosts nearly 7,500 people in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/13/greek-refugee-camp-for-640-people-found-housing-3745-eu\">space designed for 648</a>, conditions are similarly cramped. Huddled on a hill above the town of Samos, the island\u2019s capital, washing facilities are scarce. Around 400 of the thousands of people living here are unaccompanied minors, some of whom have already have skin conditions such as chronic scabies due to poor sanitary conditions.</p> <p>Guilia Cicoli, co-founder of Still I Rise NGO, which runs a youth centre for children living in Vathy camp, told the Guardian that they had spent a lot of time speaking to the children about Covid-19. The children have also produced posters about hand washing and hygiene in class.</p> <p>\u201cMost of us are Italians so we took it very seriously and started awareness raising before Greece even had any confirmed cases,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore we had to close last week we had already replaced handshakes with elbow or feet bumps.\u201d</p> <p>Movement on the Ground, a Dutch NGO, started taping dispensers of hand sanitiser to olive trees in Samos last week to encourage residents to regularly wash their hands in the dusty and dirty conditions.</p> <p>The impending threat of the virus has pushed some camp residents from Moria to seek refuge on the mainland. The Guardian knows of a number of them, some with sick family members, who decided that they could not wait for a UNHCR-organised ferry to the mainland and made their own way Athens last week after the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in Lesbos.</p> <p>This decision has left them without access to accommodation and any state provision. Yet for the families, leaving the camps seems like the safer option as many see a Covid-19 outbreak there as inevitable.</p>",
  "<p>Beijing has defended its decision to expel journalists from three major US publications, saying it was responding to \u201cunreasonable oppression\u201d of Chinese journalists in the US, as a diplomatic row escalates between the two countries.</p> <p>Speaking at a regular press briefing, the foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Beijing had been \u201ccompelled\u201d to take countermeasures after Washington imposed restrictions on staff at Chinese state media outlets in the US.</p> <p>\u201cWe urge the US to take off its ideological prejudice, abandon cold war mentality,\u201d Geng said. \u201cChina is not one to start trouble, but it will not blink if trouble comes. We urge the US side to immediately stop suppressing Chinese media, otherwise the US side will lose even more.\u201d</p> <p>At least 13 journalists will be expelled in what is an unprecedented retaliation against foreign media working in the country. An announcement made just after midnight said all US journalists working for the New York Times, Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal whose credentials were up for renewal this year would have 10 days to turn in their press cards, a measure that effectively bans them from reporting in the country.</p> <p>China has said it is responding to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/18/us-chinese-media-propaganda-state-department\">US move last month</a> to classify Chinese state media organisations as foreign missions and tighten controls on them. China\u2019s foreign ministry said such \u201cunwarranted restrictions\u201d had made work difficult for reporters and subject to \u201cpolitically motivated oppression\u201d.</p> <p>Hu Xijin, the editor of the state-run tabloid Global Times, on Wednesday warned of more retaliation. \u201cIf the two sides go after each other\u2019s journalists, American media will suffer more,\u201d he wrote on Weibo, pointing out there are 29 US outlets with operations in China, compared with 19 Chinese outlets in the US. \u201cWhether the two sides fight in terms of numbers of people or the number of media outlets, it is the US that will suffer more.\u201d</p> <p>The expulsions come as the US and China attempt to shift blame over the coronavirus outbreak that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/first-covid-19-case-happened-in-november-china-government-records-show-report\">emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December</a>. As China struggles to return to normal in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, which killed more than 3,000 people in mainland China, it has pushed the idea that the virus may have originated in the US. Donald Trump has continued to call Covid-19 the \u201cChinese virus\u201d.</p> <p>Analysts said the expulsion of foreign correspondents, many of whom have exposed issues such as re-education camps in Xinjiang or authorities\u2019 mishandling of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, is indicative of an emboldened Beijing. Last month China <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/19/china-bars-wall-street-journal-reporters-over-derogatory-column\">expelled three Wall Street Journal reporters</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThis is more about China feeling like it has the capacity to do what it\u2019s always wanted to do, which is to limit critical reporting within China,\u201d said Natasha Kassam, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute in Sydney and a former Australian diplomat.</p> <p>\u201cIn one move China can demonstrate its strength to domestic audiences and stir up existing nationalism.

Our commitment to reporting fully and deeply on China is unchanged.\u201d</p> <p>The Washington Post\u2019s executive editor, Marty Baron, said: \u201cWe unequivocally condemn any action by China to expel US reporters. The Chinese government\u2019s decision is particularly regrettable because it comes in the midst of an unprecedented global crisis, when clear and reliable information about the international response to Covid-19 is essential. Severely limiting the flow of that information, which China now seeks to do, only aggravates the situation.\u201d</p> <p>The New York Times newspaper\u2019s board said in an editorial that China\u2019s crackdown was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/opinion/china-journalists-coronavirus.html\">an unfortunate echo of the cold war</a>, and it couldn\u2019t come at a worse time.

its release: </p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>In these unprecedented and challenging times, BaptistCare have taken precautions to prioritise the safety and health of our residents, families and staff.</p> \n   <p>Older Australians are especially vulnerable to this virus, and it is vital we take additional measures to protect our residents and staff as the transmission of COVID-19 continues to escalate in the community.</p> \n   <p><strong>This is a preventative measure only and there is currently no other case of COVID-19 at any other BaptistCare home.</strong></p> \n   <p> The preventative closure to all visitors means:</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <ul> \n    <li>BaptistCare residential aged care homes <strong>will not be allowing casual and non-essential access </strong>(including families, friends, school groups).</li> \n    <li>Visits from essential services such as GPs and allied health providers will continue as per normal. </li> \n    <li>Residents will be requested to remain in our homes, with any residents who need to leave being required to isolate in their rooms on return for 7 days.</li> \n    <li>All recreational and lifestyle programs as well as chapel services at each Home will continue as long as the Home remains free of COVID-19, with social distancing measures in place as further prevention.</li> \n   </ul> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p> We are assessing this developing situation in an ongoing way, and we will advise residents and families as soon as anything changes.</p> \n   <p> We understand how difficult this will be for many of our families, and even for our residents who look forward to visits from their loved ones, however we appreciate all cooperation at this time as we do all we can to protect our residents and staff.</p> \n   <p> While we do not know exactly what is to come with this pandemic situation, we do know that the safety and health of our residents, staff and the wider community, are our ongoing

day.<br></p> \n  <p>Anyone who has been overseas in the past two weeks, been in contact with someone who has coronavirus or respiratory infection symptoms will be barred completely.<br></p> \n  <p>The

non-essential indoor gatherings of more than 100 people.</p> \n  <p>An email from Estia chief executive <strong>Ian Thornley</strong> to family and friends of residents said its facilities would close to visitors from 5pm on Wednesday.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe understand that this decision will have significant impact on our residents and their close contacts and sincerely apologise for this,\u201d he

That includes its mosques in Cabramatta, Young and Lakemba, one of Australia\u2019s largest mosques that hosts thousands of people every week. It is encouraging prayer at home. Additional activities and the night prayer during Ramadan will also be suspended. Religious counselling and other services will be offered online and over the phone.</li> \n   <li>The Anglican archbishop of Sydney, Glenn Davies, says the Anglican church in Sydney will suspend all church gatherings until further notice. He is encouraging churches to provide their services and sermons online or via other communication methods. Easter services will not take place and he will record a video of a Good Friday and Easter Sunday sermon.</li> \n   <li>Sydney synagogues have also suspended services after a recommendation from the Sydney Beth Din. In a statement, issued on Tuesday, a day before the government\u2019s announcement of the new restrictions, the authority said there was no time to waste and recommended gatherings including weddings and funerals also be limited to immediate family.</li> \n   <li>The Permanent Committee of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference was meeting today to determine its response.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T06:38:19.172Z\">at 6.38am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e71c07c8f085c6327bc209f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T06:33:29.346Z\">6.33am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Saudi Arabia has called an online G20 summit for next week, to help G20 nations build a \u201ccoordinated response\u201d to the hit to the global economy.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T06:34:55.505Z\">at 6.34am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e71c00e8f088d757559577c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T06:31:05.419Z\">6.31am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Some good news (hopefully) for those working from home:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>To support productivity and connectivity in response to COVID-19 social distancing measures, NBN Co has cleared the way for RSPs to meet the changing needs of their customers.

But an email from the senior tutor and principal of Newnham college sent on 15 March advised students to \u201cmake plans to leave your college accommodation by 19 March at the very latest and earlier if possible\u201d unless it is \u201ctruly your home\u201d.</p> <p>A director of studies at Cambridge, who wished to remain anonymous, said the messages to students from different colleges he had seen shared the \u201csame cold-blooded and brutal core message, basically we really don\u2019t want you here\u201d.</p> <p>He added that international students and those from Northern Ireland had been put in a position of having to find flights \u201cat very short notice and so at high cost\u201d. \u201cColleges are very protective of their students in the good times but it now appears that in times of crisis they look after themselves.\u201d</p> <p>Marina Veli\u010dkovi\u0107, a PhD student at Pembroke college, said she had to scramble to get home to Bosnia-Herzegovina, as many flights were being cancelled. She said her college\u2019s handling of the situation had been irresponsible and panic-inducing.</p> <p>In a Twitter thread, Veli\u010dkovi\u0107 complained that the college had told international students not to leave two weeks ago, when travel could have posed less risk of spreading the virus, then abruptly changed its position.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/17/chinese-students-flee-uk-after-maskaphobia-triggered-racist-attacks\">Chinese students flee UK after 'maskaphobia' triggered racist attacks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She wrote: \u201c[T]elling us not to leave, telling us to revise our plans \u2026 and then telling us, our bad, actually leave, is irresponsible.

  "<p>The dissident father of the Manchester Arena bomber, who was arrested in Libya the day after the blast alongside his other terrorist son, was quietly released without charge and has vanished.</p> <p>Ramadan Abedi, 54, fought against the Gaddafi regime in Libya with a militant group that was designated a terrorist organisation by the US. After his arrest, he and his son Hashem were held by the Rada Special Deterrence Force, the most powerful of Tripoli\u2019s militias, at its base at Mitiga airport with dozens of other terrorist suspects and fighters.</p> <p>As the jail was repeatedly attacked by rival militias trying to free members held there, the British focused on bringing Hashem Abedi, 22, back to the UK to face charges in relation to the bombing. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/17/hashem-abedi-brother-of-manchester-arena-bomber-being-extradited-to-uk\">was eventually extradited last year</a>, but Ramadan was released without charge and disappeared.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know [where he is], nobody is speaking about it,\u201d said Abdel al-Fattah, the director of the foreign media office of Libya\u2019s UN-backed government. \u201cEven the local media don\u2019t speak about him.\u201d</p> <p>There is no mention of him on Libyan social media and a British diplomatic source said the UK had no contact with the dual Libyan-British national.</p> <p>When the Guardian contacted Kerea Tabbal, Ramadan\u2019s mother-in-law and the brothers\u2019 maternal grandmother at her home in Libya, she refused to confirm any details about his location. She responded angrily to being called, saying: \u201cI am an old woman, don\u2019t you have any shame?\u201d</p> <p>Former editor of the English-language Libya Herald newspaper Michel Cousins said Ramadan Abedi had no public profile in Libya prior to the Manchester bombing and his vanishing from sight after release excited no curiosity: \u201cHe\u2019s not important as far as Libyans are concerned, they don\u2019t want to know about it (the trial), its embarrassing. There are only two issues in Libya, the conflict east against west, and coronavirus.\u201d</p> <p>Hashem Abedi was transferred to Britain in July 2019 after both militia and government agreed to the UK request, but there was no news of Ramadan, with a British source saying only that he was no longer being held in jail.</p> <p>The veteran of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG), an Islamist guerrilla organisation that battled Gaddafi\u2019s forces in the 1990s, first arrived in Britain in 1994. When the LIFG was defeated, many veterans fled to Afghanistan and Iraq, several becoming prominent members of al-Qaida.</p> <p>Initially Ramadan went to Saudi Arabia, but it is understood the Saudis persuaded Britain to take him in during a period when the two countries were negotiating the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/07/bae15\">Al-Yamamah arms deal</a>.</p> <p>In Manchester, Ramadan, a security officer, was popular among some Libyan exiles, being assigned the role of muezzin at Didsbury mosque and calling out prayer five times a day.</p> <p>He and his wife, Samia, lived in south Manchester for more than a decade. All of their children were enrolled in schools and the family were said to be settled.</p> <p>However, some Manchester Libyans began to object to his radical style. \u201cWe call them the Abus, because they all adopt these kunyas, these nicknames, its like \u2018comrade\u2019, an alias,\u201d said one British-Libyan resident. \u201cThere is tension, a lot of Libyans in Manchester, they don\u2019t want to be associated with them.\u201d</p> <p>In 2011, Ramadan decided to travel back to his north African homeland to fight in the civil war, also referred to as the Libyan revolution, once again with the LIFG. The US state department says elements of the LIFG were aligned with Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida and it designated the group a foreign terrorist organisation in 2004. The armed conflict between forces loyal to Gaddafi and those seeking to oust his government lasted for eight months, but Ramadan was never to make the UK his home again.</p> <p>Fellow LIFG fighter Akram Ramadan, 49, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/may/24/bombers-father-fought-against-gaddafi-regime-with-terrorist-group\">previously told the Guardian</a> that Ramadan was passionate about overthrowing a regime that had \u201cdisplaced thousands of his brethren \u2026 It was something we all felt we had to do. Some were more radical than others but we all shared a common cause.</p> <p>\u201cI saw Ramadan in the mountains and later in Tripoli. We were all soldiers \u2013 we all bore arms. It was a war zone. Many of the people who fought in the conflict weren\u2019t actually born in Libya, but they had this common cause of their families being persecuted or being kicked out of the country by the regime.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I met Ramadan it was always at the forefront of his mind about how we were going to gain control of our country again. He was very passionate about the common cause and common good for Libya.\u201d</p> <p>He said the LIFG fought again Gaddafi in the mid-90s in the eastern side of Libya and was defeated in 1996. \u201cIt was a group that wanted to overthrow Gaddafi but they also possibly had some guys who were affiliated with al-Qaida. Did some of these guys carry the torch of al-Qaida? Possibly.\u201d</p> <p>In 2013, Ramadan resurfaced online and wrote a supportive post of another Libyan radical, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/oct/11/afghanistan.september111\">Anas Al-Libi</a>, who was given asylum in Manchester despite his involvement in a failed plot to assassinate Egypt\u2019s then-president Hosni Mubarak. Libi was later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/07/son-al-qaida-suspect-libya\">captured in Tripoli</a> by US special forces and charged with bombing US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.</p> <p>British support for Libyan dissidents changed abruptly after Tony Blair\u2019s rapprochement with Gaddafi, sealed with the famous \u201cmeeting in the desert\u201d in 2004.</p> <p>Under Blair\u2019s pro-Gaddafi policy, MI6 agents arranged the kidnapping of the LIFG leader, Abdul Hakim Bilhaj, and his deputy, Sami Saadi, from exile in Asia. Both were flown to Libya to be jailed and tortured, and they later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/10/britain-apologises-for-appalling-treatment-of-abdel-hakim-belhaj\">successfully sued</a> the British government.</p> <p>During the 2011 Arab spring, British policy switched yet again, back to supporting Libyan dissidents, encouraging exiles, such as Ramadan, to return to Libya to fight Gaddafi, and contributing RAF warplanes to a Nato-led bombing campaign. Ramadan joined the revolution and afterwards settled in Tripoli.</p> <p>In 2012, he posted a picture on social media of Hashem, then 15, holding a Kalashnikov with the caption: \u201cHashem the lion \u2026 training.\u201d</p> <p>In an interview in 2017, shortly before he and Hashem were seized by Tripoli militia, Ramadan proclaimed his innocence, saying: \u201cWe condemn these terrorist acts on civilians. We do not believe in killing innocent people.\u201d</p>",

She said she is becoming increasingly worried as volunteers cancel.</p> <p>\u201cWe have had a lot of cancellations and that really scares me. You know, these people we are helping are just as scared as people in the UK are but they have no sanitation, they can\u2019t wash their hands, they can\u2019t shower. I\u2019m really scared and frightened for them.\u201d</p> <p>Care4Calais estimates there are around 1,000 people living outside in Calais and a further 2,000 across Dunkirk and the coastal area. She fears an outbreak would be devastating for an already vulnerable population.</p> <p>\u201cWe are incredibly worried about it, there are a lot of people whose health is not good and they are living outside. These people are suffering already from underlying lung issues, from exposure, tiredness, cold and they are obviously not able to self-isolate.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m really frightened, we need the big aid organisations here; [M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res] and the Red Cross have been in France in the past, we need them back. \u201d</p> <p>Juliette Delapace, project manager for Catholic charity Caritas in northern France, was running a day centre in Calais, which has been forced to close in recent days.</p> <p>\u201cNow we have had to close the hundreds of people we give somewhere warm and safe to stay for a few hours really have nobody to help them and nowhere to go,\u201d she says. \u201cBefore, it was politically expedient for the state to deny help to this community because they knew NGOs would fill the gap, but now we cannot do this because we need to protect our volunteers and staff and limit the potential spread among people who are very vulnerable and have poor health.\u201d</p> <p>Delapace said it would be impossible for migrants and refugees in northern France to effectively self-isolate if they started feeling ill as they had nowhere to live and no way of getting food.</p> <p>\u201cThey can\u2019t even call the emergency services because to do that you need to be able to charge your phone and the only place they could do that was the day centres and services that have now been shut.\u201d</p> <p>Concerns over staff passing on the virus to vulnerable migrants is also an issue in Greece, where the International Rescue Committee (IRC) are already taking precautionary steps.</p> <p>Dimitra Kalogeropoulou, IRC country director in Greece, told the Guardian: \u201cIt is is a grave concern for us that we don\u2019t expose the people we work with to the virus.

  "<p>Hopes for a recovery of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/brazil\">Brazil</a>\u2019s most endangered ecosystem have been given a boost by the first birth of a wild tapir in Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Atlantic Forest for more than a century.</p> <p>Scientists said video clips of the baby tapir proved the initial success of a re-introduction strategy for the threatened mammal, which is often described as \u201ca forest gardener\u201d because it plays a vital role in the dispersal of seeds.</p> <p>The images of the pig-like calf with a characteristic prehensile snout were captured by a camera trap in the Guapia\u00e7u Ecological Reserve and released in Brazilian media outlets.</p> <p>Researchers believed the calf was born in January and a second may be on its way because another adult female appears to be pregnant.</p> <p>Maron Galliez, a professor of biology at the <a href=\"https://ifrj-cmar.wixsite.com/lemas/equipe\">Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology</a> of Rio de Janeiro, said this was a milestone for the reintroduction project, which has been eight years in planning and implementation.</p> <p>Since 2017, four captive-bred males and three females have been put into the forest by the Refauna programme, which Galliez leads.</p> <p>\u201cThe whole team is very happy,\u201d he said \u201cWe now know the project is moving in the right direction.\u201d</p> <p>As with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/25/yellowstone-wolf-project-25th-anniversary\">wolves in Yellowstone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/17/beavers-cut-flooding-and-pollution-and-boost-wildlife-populations\">beavers in the UK</a>, the tapir reintroduction programme aims to accelerate restoration of a degraded natural habitat.</p> <p>The Atlantic Forest, which once covered more than a million square kilometres along the eastern coast of Brazil and Argentina, has been steadily sliced and diced by loggers, plantation owners and economic development.</p> <p>Trees now cover just 7% to 15% of the forest\u2019s former area, mostly in shrinking fragments between expanding cities. But it remains a globally important ecosystem due to its role in carbon sequestration, water management and habitat provision to a wide range of species including capybara, armadillos, toucans and capuchins.</p> <p>Tapirs were eradicated in Rio de Janeiro state in 2014, and biologists say their return is more than symbolic.</p> <p>Growing to 2.5 metres in length and weighing more than 300kg, they are the largest terrestrial mammals in Brazil and play an important role in the dispersal of large seeds that can provide the pillars of the canopy. They also prune branches and leaves.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/onearth/how-do-you-regrow-rainforest-send-tapirs\">study</a> last year indicated tapirs could make reforestation quicker and cheaper because they tend to graze in degraded areas and their dung is packed with tree seeds.</p> <p>\u201cThe birth of a tapir in nature indicates the formation of a population in the state,\u201d Galliez said. \u201cThis is essential to restoring the proper functioning of this ecosystem.</p> <p>There are other encouraging signs. Deforestation of the Atlantic Forest <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2019/07/deforestation-drops-in-brazils-atlantic-forest-but-risks-remain-experts/\">fell by 9.3% </a>from October 2017 to April 2018, according to satellite analysis by the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research.</p> <p>Close to the border with Argentina, this forest is also the only place in South America where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/14/jaguar-species-virtually-extinct-brazil\">jaguars</a> have increased in recent years as a result of heightened anti-poaching measures by the authorities and fewer conflicts with humans as a result of the shift from cattle ranching to soya farming.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2019/aug/19/brazil-to-open-long-distance-hiking-trail-in-atlantic-forest-in-pictures\">Brazil to open long-distance hiking trail in Atlantic forest \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, conservationists warn these improvements are from a dangerously low baseline and the overall trend for the forest is still downward due to pressure from agribusiness and land speculation. The lowland tapir is classified as a vulnerable animal, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.</p> <p>Galliez said the return of a tapir population in Rio de Janeiro could be a turning point, but only if there was further support from donors to support conservation and reintroduction programmes, and from the authorities to curb poaching and deforestation. Currently, he said, these do not go far enough.<br></p>",
  "<p>The worst possible people are in charge at the worst possible time. In the UK, the US and Australia, the politics of the governing parties have been built on the dismissal and denial of risk. Just as these politics have delayed the necessary responses to climate breakdown, ecological collapse, air and water pollution, obesity and consumer debt, so they appear to have delayed the effective containment of Covid-19.</p> <p>I believe it is no coincidence that these three governments have responded later than comparable nations have, and with measures that seemed woefully unmatched to the scale of the crisis.

In the US, the UK and Australia, they are very small indeed: mostly multimillionaires and a very particular group of companies: those whose profits depend on the cavalier treatment of people and planet.</p> <p>Over the past 20 years, I have researched the remarkably powerful but mostly hidden role of tobacco and oil companies in shaping public policy in these three nations.

The party became divided between an older, conservative base, with a strong aversion to novelty and change, and its polar opposite: the risk-taking radical right. Leaving the European Union permits a reconciliation of these very different interests, simultaneously threatening food standards and environmental protections, as well as price controls on medicines and other crucial regulations, while raising barriers to immigration and integration with other nations.

The agreement allows EU countries to band together to use their combined purchasing power to get a good deal on vaccines and other medical supplies.</p> \n  <p>The EU executive is organising joint procurement of protective clothing for medics, including masks, as well as ventilators. The commission spokesperson said \u201ca very big majority of member states [were] interested\u201d in taking part in the joint procurement on ventilators. The British government has not revealed whether it intends to take part in any of the procurement schemes.</p> \n  <p>On Monday, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/16/vauxhall-owner-psa-car-shuts-european-plants-amid-coronavirus-fears\">urged British industry to step forward and build 20,000 ventilators \u201cat speed\u201d</a>. The NHS has 5,900 ventilators, but might need more than three times as many in the worst-case scenario for the spread of Covid-19.</p> \n  <p>The UK will be expected to apply EU-wide restrictions on the export of medical goods outside the bloc, passed in emergency legislation on Sunday. For a period of six weeks, EU countries and the UK will have to seek approval to export critical medical supplies outside the bloc.</p> \n  <p>Later on Tuesday, EU leaders are expected to adopt a 30-day travel ban on non-EU citizens entering the union, but the commission has said restrictions will not apply to the UK. There are exemptions for residents, diplomats, healthcare workers and researchers, and people delivering goods.</p> \n  <p>The UK and <strong>Ireland</strong>, neither in the EU\u2019s Schengen passport-free travel zone, are being \u201cencouraged\u201d to enforce the travel ban.</p> \n  <p> A UK spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK can choose whether to opt in to this proposal if it is agreed.

Our first priority is non-negotiable: to save lives,\u201d he told Greeks in a televised speech from his Maximos office. \u201cThat is why, much earlier than other European countries, we enforced measures that are unprecedented in peacetime. And we are continuing in that direction.\u201d </p> \n  <p>So far, Greek health authorities have announced 387 confirmed cases of coronavirus, revealing this afternoon that a fifth person had fallen victim to Covid-19. There were 35 new cases in the last 24 hours, the health ministry spokesman and infectious disease expert professor Sotiris Tsiodras told reporters. Of the total number, 11 were in intensive care, he said. </p> \n  <p>Fearing the fate of Italy, the centre-right government has threatened to be merciless with those who flout tough restrictions that as of Wednesday will also include all shops being closed across Greece, with the exception of supermarkets.

Trials of the drug, which are necessarily thorough, including checking its efficacy and potential side effects, mean that even if approved, it is not likely to be available until next spring.</p> \n  <p>It spent the first 15 minutes, though, attempting to quash the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/trump-offers-large-sums-for-exclusive-access-to-coronavirus-vaccine\">reports</a> in recent days according to which the company had been approached by the US government with an offer to exclusively buy up the vaccine it is working on, for one billion dollars. </p> \n  <p>First, to those rumours, the companies managers said they were just that. They categorically denied there was any truth in them, explaining that company bosses had been invited at extremely short notice to visit the White House last week, and speak to US government officials, along with representatives of other international companies working on coronavirus vaccines. This is despite the fact that the German interior minister, foreign minister, even the chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the owner of CureVac, Dietmar Hopp, had commented on the reports as if they had been true, saying that \u201cGermany is not for sale\u201d. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThis technology (to make the vaccine) can be applicable for anyone and there have not been requests for us to do it exclusively for the US,\u201d CureVac\u2019s deputy CEO Franz-Werner Haas told journalists. \u201cWe did not talk to Maas (the foreign minister) or Seehofer (the interior minister) so we cannot comment on that.\u201d</p> \n  <p>CureVac is a 20 year old company which develops therapies based on the molecule messenger RNA (mRNA) and has specialised in developing vaccines for infectious diseases as well as on drugs to treat cancer. Mariola Fotin-Mletczek, PhD, chief technology officer, explained the vaccine technology she is currently working on. \u201cNature has very good mechanisms for fighting against pathogens - viruses and bacteria - and with our technology we mimic nature\u2019s approach,\u201d she said. \u201cThe way we formulate this messenger molecule means it mimics this virus situation. </p> \n  <p>This means that we induce the immune response which is very similar to the natural immune response. With our approach, messenger RNA encodes one specific protein from the virus, the critical one, which is sufficient to mobilise the immune system. We do this in such a way that we use this natural mechanism which really helps to induce and to produce huge amounts of potent anti-bodies which neutralise the virus. </p> \n  <p>And that is exactly what we saw in the trial with our latest vaccine based on exactly the same technology. Also here we see that two doses of one microgram are sufficient to mobilise the immune system in the right way and to induce production of protective antibodies above the defined threshold, which means protection.\u201dShe said that laboratory trials on the vaccine would start in April and clinical trials would begin in the early summer.</p> \n  <p>The company has received an 80 million Euro grant from the European Commission in the last few days, which will enable it to \u201caccelerate the upscaling of a manufacturing unit which would produce the vaccine which is already being built,\u201d according to Florian von der M\u00fclbe, chief production officer and co-founder of CureVac. </p> \n  <p>This means once it got the go-ahead, the company could potentially produce high quantities of the drug so that it could be made available worldwide. The production facilities could be replicated easily elsewhere, increasing the efficiency and speed with which it could be made available, he added.</p> \n  <p>Lothar Wieler, president of the Robert Koch Institute, the main public health body in Germany, said earlier today, the concept was based on tumour therapy, with the vaccine \u201creacting to the protein in the virus and receiving an answer from it\u201d. It is a technology already used to fight cancers, he said. \u201cIf it works, it would be amazing,\u201d he said, calling the technology \u201cfast, cheap and efficient\u201d. But based on current information, and he would not expect a vaccine to be ready until next spring.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e70ee018f085e564ad85d05\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/benquinn\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-17T15:39:53.572Z\">3.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/coronavirus-france-on-war-footing-as-europe-locks-down-macron\">\u2022 The EU is set to endorse the strictest travel ban in its history as France joined Italy and Spain in full lockdown and Donald Trump told Americans to change their behaviour, acknowledging for the first time that beating the coronavirus could take months.</a><br>EU leaders are expected on Tuesday to suspend all travel into the passport-free Schengen zone by non-EU nationals for at least 30 days in a bid to instil uniformity across the bloc after some member states, including Austria, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland, unilaterally began imposing border checks.<br></p> \n  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/trump-calls-covid-19-the-chinese-virus-as-rift-with-coronavirus-beijing-escalates\">\u2022 Donald Trump has referred to the coronavirus as \u201cthe Chinese virus\u201d, escalating a deepening US-China diplomatic spat over the outbreak.</a></strong><br>After giving an address on Monday warning of a possible recession, the US president posted on Twitter: \u201cThe United States will be powerfully supporting those industries, like Airlines and others, that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus.

Sorry to say that I, today, have tested positive for COVID19, Corona virus. My familiy and I are self-isolating at home for as long as it takes. We are in good health - I only have mild symptoms of a cold. There are people at higher risk for who this virus might be a devastating diagnosis, so I urge all of you to be extremely careful; wash your hands, keep 1,5 meters distance from others, go in quarantine; just do everything you can to stop the virus from spreading. Together we can fight this virus and avert a crisis at our hospitals. Please take care of each other, keep your distance, and stay healthy! Please visit your country&amp;#39;s Center for Disease Control&amp;#39;s website, and follow the regulations for staying safe and protecting not just yourselves, but our entire community, and especially those at risk like the elderly and people with pre-existing conditions. @grymolvaerhivju #fightcorona #solidarity #takecare #folkehelseinstituttet Thanks to @panoramaagency</a></p> <p style=&quot;

The question is: How? </p> \n  <p>Here is a summary of the latest developments:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The head of the World Health Organizaion, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, implored governments to test more suspected cases, </strong>warning that they cannot fight the pandemic blindfolded.<strong> </strong>In a strongly-worded attack on governments which have neglected or held back testing, he said: \u201cWe have not seen an urgent enough escalation in testing, isolation and contact tracing, which is the backbone of the response.\u201d<br></li> \n   <li><strong>The White House recommended isolation.</strong> US President Donald Trump told Americans to avoid any gatherings of more than 10 people over the next 15 days and advising all states with evidence of community transmission to close down bars, restaurants, gyms and other facilities.</li> \n   <li><strong>The death toll in Italy from Covid-19 increased to 2,158, with the announcement of another 349 victims in Europe\u2019s worst his country.</strong> Spain confirmed 9,191 cases and 309 deaths, making it the second hardest-hit country in Europe after Italy.</li> \n   <li><strong>The death toll in the UK increased to 55 people, including the first death in Wales</strong>. The latest victims included a 56-year-old, believed to be the youngest in the UK so far.</li> \n   <li><strong>Britons were told to avoid pubs, bars and restaurants and to self-isolate if anyone in their family fell ill.</strong> The new government advice, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/pm-tells-britons-to-avoid-non-essential-contact-with-others\">something of a U-turn</a>, came during the prime minister\u2019s first daily press conference. Boris Johnson unveiled a series of stringent new restrictions, including a 14-day isolation for all households with symptoms, a warning against \u201cnon-essential\u201d contact, and an end to all mass gatherings. </li> \n   <li><strong> </strong><strong>The G7 nations stressed the importance of international cooperation.</strong> A statement released by Downing Street sought to highlight the significance of national governments not looking solely to their own interests \u2013 acknowledging that coronavirus is a global pandemic.</li> \n   <li><strong> </strong><strong>Germany closed places of worship, bars, restaurants, museums and cinemas. </strong>Announcing the plan, Chancellor Angela Merkel said: \u201cThe more individuals stick to these rules, the quicker we will get through this phase.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>The actor Idris Elba has become the latest celebrity to contract the virus</strong>. Earlier this month he was photographed at an event at London\u2019s Wembley Arena with Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau \u2013 just over week before she tested positive.</li> \n   <li><strong>The European Union has proposed banning all but essential travel for 30 days.</strong> Egypt, Canada, and Malaysia have become the latest countries to close airports.</li> \n   <li><strong>France has warned of a \u201cfast-deteriorating\u201d situation and Spain has requisitioned its private healthcare sector. </strong>J\u00e9r\u00f4me Salomon, France\u2019s top health official, said on Monday, \u201cThere is a real worry the speed of the outbreak <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-spain-takes-over-private-healthcare-amid-more-european-lockdowns\">could saturate hospitals</a>.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>Mounting concerns that the pandemic could prompt a global recession have sent financial markets around the world plunging, </strong>despite a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/16/markets-hit-by-further-losses-despite-us-interest-rate-cut-willie-walsh-ba-coronavirus\">coordinated effort by central banks</a> to protect growth and jobs. <br></li> \n   <li><strong>Major airlines including Qantas, British Airways, Ryanair, easyJet and Virgin Atlantic announced a dramatic scaling back of their operations on Monday, </strong>with cuts of up to 90% of their services. </li> \n   <li><strong>The official global death toll from the coronavirus outbreak has now passed 6,500, </strong>with the number of deaths and infections around the world now exceeding those in China, where it began. Infections have been reported in 156 countries.</li> \n   <li><strong>In the UK, an NHS document leaked to the media suggested that the coronavirus emergency could last up to a year </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/uk-coronavirus-crisis-to-last-until-spring-2021-and-could-see-79m-hospitalised\">and put 8m people in hospital</a>. This morning, Downing St said the 8m figure was a worst case scenario, rather than what the government expected.</li> \n   <li><strong>Passengers on the London Underground network are down by nearly a fifth compared to the same time last year</strong>, while numbers on buses were down by 10%.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Spanish government has requisitioned its private healthcare sector</strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-live-updates-us-cdc-events-europe-lockdown-uk-deaths-australia-france-italy-spain-update-latest-news?page=with:block-5e6f65758f085c6327bc0aa3#block-5e6f65758f085c6327bc0aa3\"> </a>and given any company that has supplies of protective gear 48 hours to report to health authorities, or face fines.</li> \n   <li><strong>The government of Singapore sharply criticised responses to the outbreak by the UK, Switzerland and Japan</strong>, saying that \u201cthese countries have abandoned any attempt at containing the spread of the virus,\u201d as he announced new travel restrictions.</li> \n   <li><strong>New York City will close the largest public school system in the US on Monday,</strong> and its bars, restaurants and entertainment venues from Tuesday.</li> \n   <li><strong>The states of California, Ohio, Illinois, Massachusetts and Washington closed their bars, restaurants and entertainment venues, too.</strong> Food takeout and delivery are still allowed. </li> \n   <li><strong>Luxembourg on Sunday followed its neighbours France and Belgium in closing bars and restaurants</strong> to try to stem the spread of the coronavirus epidemic.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div>",
  "<p>All criminal trials expected to last more than three days will be postponed at least until after the end of April, the lord chief justice of England and Wales has announced.</p> <p>In the first major response by the justice system to the health alarm over the coronavirus, Lord Burnett of Maldon has decided to delay longer running trials because of the risk that too many jurors could fall ill so the hearing might have to be abandoned.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.judiciary.uk/announcements/coronavirus-jury-trials-message-from-the-lord-chief-justice/\">In a statement on Tuesday evening</a>, the judiciary\u2019s head said: \u201cTrials in the crown court present particular problems in a fast-developing situation because they require the presence in court of many different participants including the judge, the jury, a defendant, lawyers and witnesses as well as staff.</p> <p>\u201cGiven the risks of a trial not being able to complete, I have decided that no new trial should start in the crown court unless it is expected to last for three days or less. All cases estimated to last longer than three days listed to start before the end of April 2020 will be adjourned.</p> <p>\u201cThese cases will be kept under review and the position regarding short trials will be revisited as circumstances develop and in any event next week. As events unfold decisions will be taken in respect of all cases awaiting trial in the crown court. Trials currently under way will generally proceed in the hope that they can be completed.\u201d</p> <p>Up until Tuesday, the Ministry of Justice had merely recommended that jurors feeling ill should stay away from court and that wherever possible more use should be made of remote video-links for evidence to be given.</p> <p>But pressure for action had been growing as large sections of the economy move towards working from home. Earlier the Scottish courts and tribunals service declared no more fresh jury trials would start because of the risk of viral infection.</p> <p>In a statement issued at lunchtime on Tuesday the Scottish authority said it was trying to take appropriate measures to protect the health of all court users. \u201cAs a result from today, 17 March,\u201d it noted, \u201cno new criminal jury trials will be commenced or new juries empanelled until further notice. This will be kept under review. Where jury trials have already commenced these will run to conclusion of the trial, if practical to do so.\u201d</p> <p>Calls for judicial action in England and Wales had been increasing. Earlier on Tuesday, Amanda Pinto QC, chair of the Bar Council, which represents all barristers south of the border, urged the government to temporarily end jury trials during the Covid-19 outbreak.<br><br>She said: \u201cWe are calling for the Ministry of Justice to put an urgent halt to jury trials for the time being \u2026 Being in a jury trial should not be a game of Russian roulette with the participants\u2019 health.</p> <p>\u201cAll those involved in court proceedings, be they barristers, witnesses, defendants, jurors or members of the public (let alone court staff and judges), should not be expected to attend court, whilst the rest of the country is very strongly urged to work from home and to avoid \u2018non-essential contact\u2019 and \u2018confined spaces\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Caroline Goodwin QC, chair of the Criminal Bar Association in England and Wales, had also warned: \u201cStatements indicating that the courts are operating as normal or that it is business as usual emanating from the government do not reflect the realities on the ground. Many of our members may have either pre-existing conditions/pregnancy or close family members falling into the priority groups.</p> <p>\u201cThe CBA considers that the current risks posed to court users, including our members, by the continuation of jury trials at this stage, absent proper procedures and protocols being put in place, is too great.</p> <p>\u201cCourt hearings should be limited to those considered essential for the time being, with others utilising phone and video-links where appropriate and subject to proper safeguards. We would oppose any effort to curtail this fundamental right and conduct trials without juries.\u201d</p>"
