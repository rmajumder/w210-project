One of the effects is that gradually more people become immune to the virus, which will eventually lead to herd immunity, as is the case for other viral infections. As we are dealing with a newly emerged virus, WHO correctly states that there is no certainty about the development of immunity against COVID-19, or about how long this immunity will last.

Greece is preparing to lift restrictions on movements to the islands. European stock markets have rallied. </p> <h2><strong>Boris Johnson says the UK is beginning to turn the tide </strong></h2> <p>The prime minister said the UK is turning the tide on tackling coronavirus but is still facing a moment of \u201cmaximum risk\u201d and he will not be forced to end the lockdown prematurely. Speaking outside 10 Downing Street on Monday, his first day back after recovering from coronavirus, he urged the public and business to contain their impatience to lift the restrictions. </p> <h2><strong>Iran announces 96 more deaths </strong></h2> <p>A further 96 people have died of coronavirus in Iran taking its death toll to 5,806, the ministry of heath announced. But Iran plans to go ahead with reopening of mosques in areas where the virus has not struck. </p> <h2>Russia has passed China in the number of new infections </h2> <p>Russia has confirmed 6,198 new coronavirus cases over the past day, bringing the total number in the country to 87,147 in all regions, the anti-coronavirus crisis centre reported on Monday. This is more than the 84,500 confirmed cases in China. Meanwhile, China has denied it is spreading disinformation about the virus. </p> <h2><strong>New Zealand prepares to move out of its strict lockdown measures</strong></h2> <p>The government reported only one new confirmed case of Covid-19 and said it had eliminated the virus. At 11.59pm on Monday, New Zealand will lift its level-4 lockdown which has been in place for more than four weeks. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern said the nation had \u201cwon the battle\u201d against widespread community transmission.</p> <h2><strong>More US states to end lockdown as economy crumbles</strong></h2> <p>Colorado, Mississippi, Minnesota, Montana and Tennessee will join other US states in the lifting of lockdown restrictions, as economists predict an unemployment rate of 16% or higher for the month of April. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said some regions of the state might qualify to open sooner \u201cwith certain precautions\u201d, such as upstate New York, as the daily death toll was markedly lower on Sunday than it was on Saturday.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-27T11:04:45.098Z\">at 12.04pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ea6ac0d8f0845d1c895e6b1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-27T10:00:37.404Z\">11.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Iran announces 96 more deaths</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A further 96 people have died of coronavirus in <strong>Iran,</strong> taking its death toll to 5,806 the ministry of heath announced.

At least 206,549 people have lost their lives in the coronavirus pandemic, though the true toll is likely to be much higher due to under-reporting and some countries not including deaths among those with underlying conditions in their tolls.</li> <li><strong>New Zealand prepares to move out of its strict lockdown measures. </strong>The government reported only one new confirmed case of Covid-19 and said it had eliminated the virus. At 11.59pm on Monday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/new-zealand-prepares-to-lift-strict-lockdown-after-eliminating-coronavirus\">New Zealand will lift its level-4 lockdown</a> which has been in place for more than four weeks. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern said the nation had \u201cwon the battle\u201d against widespread community transmission.</li> <li><strong>More US states to end lockdown as economy crumbles. </strong>Colorado, Mississippi, Minnesota, Montana and Tennessee will join other US states in the lifting of lockdown restrictions, as economists predict an unemployment rate of 16% or higher for the month of April. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said some regions of the state might qualify to open sooner \u201cwith certain precautions\u201d, such as upstate New York, as the daily death toll was markedly lower on Sunday than it was on Saturday.</li> <li><strong>The UK economy will take three years to recover from coronavirus. </strong>It will take the UK economy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/27/uk-economy-will-take-three-years-to-recover-from-coronavirus-ey\">three years to fully recover</a> from the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a leading forecasting group. As the damage to jobs and growth unfolds, the EY Item Club said it would take until 2023 for the the economy to return to the level reached at the end of last year due to the depth of the crisis, Richard Partington reports.</li> <li><strong>British PM returns to Downing Street. </strong>Boris Johnson returned to Downing Street on Sunday night for the first time since he was admitted to hospital with Covid-19 on 6 April. The UK reported its lowest daily rise in the death toll since the end of March. The number of deaths in UK hospitals from the coronavirus has risen to 20,732 \u2013 an increase of 413 in the last 24 hours</li> <li><strong>Trump denies he will fire his health chief. </strong>US president Donald Trump, who for a second day skipped the White House press briefing, on Twitter denied reports that he planned to fire health and human services secretary Alex Azar. He said Azar was doing \u201can excellent job!\u201d. Trump also attacked the press, and was roundly mocked after tweeting about \u201cNoble\u201d prize for journalists, seeming to mean the Nobel prizes \u2013 which are not awarded in the field of journalism.</li> <li><strong>Lebanon\u2019s roads blocked in protest at dire economy. </strong>Demonstrators blocked roads through Lebanon late on Sunday to protest against the deteriorating economic situation, despite a lockdown and curfew imposed because of the coronavirus. Lebanon\u2019s worst economic crisis since the 1975-90 civil war is now compounded by the coronavirus lockdown. Forty-five per cent of the population are in poverty, according to official estimates. Its economy is forecast to contract 12% in 2020, according to the International Monetary Fund.</li> <li><strong>A million Australians downloaded a coronavirus tracking app. </strong>Health minister Greg Hunt said 1.13 million Australians downloaded the tracing app CovidSafe as of 6am (20.00 GMT) on Monday, nearly 4.5% of the country\u2019s population. </li> <li><strong>European countries announce easing of lockdown measures. </strong>Italy recorded lowest daily deaths since mid-March and prime minister Giuseppe Conte told the nation \u201cif you love Italy, maintain distance\u201d as he announced a plan that will see the country slowly ease lockdown measures from 4 May. The prime minister of France, Edouard Philippe, will on Tuesday present a national strategy for emerging from the coronavirus lockdown to the national assembly, while Spain partially relaxed its lockdown as its daily death toll dropped below 300 for the first time in weeks.</li> <li><strong>Egypt asks IMF for coronavirus bailout loan. </strong>Egypt declared on Sunday that it had asked the International Monitory Fund (IMF) for financial assistance to deal with the economic fallout caused by the coronavirus.

As a result, it expected the number of sales over the course of the year to be just half of 2019\u2019s figure.</p> \n<p>This is a steeper fall than that forecast by the property firm Knight Frank, which has suggested completions will drop from 1.17m last year to just 734,000 this year.</p> \n<p>Zoopla said the number of new sales agreed was running at about a 10th of the level achieved in early March, \u201cwith volumes similar to what you would expect to see in late December\u201d, when the market is traditionally quieter.</p> \n<p>Those who are still making offers may be tempted by low mortgage rates and a lack of competition from other buyers.</p> \n<p>Last week, Zoopla\u2019s rival Rightmove said buyers were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/20/coronavirus-outbreak-will-halt-520000-uk-house-sales-in-2020\">making offers based on virtual viewings</a> of properties, and builders have reported sales being agreed despite marketing suites remaining closed.</p> \n<p>The delay in completions means estate agents will have to wait longer for their commission.

Asked about the likely overall death toll, he said: </li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>My view, actually, is we need to view this epidemic over the long run, and this has got a very long way to run.</p> \n   <p>I\u2019m really cautious about putting out these kind of absolute numbers, because this could go in a lot of different ways over the next many months until such time as we have a clear exit that has a vaccine or drugs or some other route that allows us to be able to say we now can stop people dying from this. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And later he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This has got a very long way to run. Just thinking about the first peak, which due to the fantastic work the whole nation has done and the work of the NHS we have actually managed to go through - we have still got some way before it is falling right off - but there is a long, long way to go beyond that. And I think it\u2019s a big mistake, in my view, just to consider just the first phase. We need to consider the epidemic as a whole. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Ministers insist their priority at the moment is to avoid a second peak. Whitty\u2019s comment suggests the scientists think some sort of second peak is inevitable.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said that he was \u201cvery worried\u201d by reports of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/27/what-is-the-new-illness-affecting-children-and-is-it-linked-to-coronavirus\">a small number of children needing treatment in intensive care for for a condition called \u201cmulti-system inflammatory state\u201d.</a></strong> Whitty said it was \u201centirely plausible\u201d that this was linked to coronavirus. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/27/uk-coronavirus-live-news-boris-johnson-back-at-work-amid-talk-of-easing-lockdown?page=with:block-5ea70e5e8f0821d5b0274a38#block-5ea70e5e8f0821d5b0274a38\">6pm.)</a></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Whitty was unable to reassure grandparents that they will be able to hug their grandchildren any time soon.</strong> He was responding to a question submitted by Lynne, a woman from Skipton, who was the first person to participate under a new initiative allowing a member of the public to submit a question every day. She asked:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m missing my grandchildren so much. Please can you let me know if, after the five criteria are met, is being able to hug our closest family one of the first steps out of lockdown?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Whitty said this would depend on whether Lynne has a \u201csignificant medical problem in a way that means she has to be shielding and she\u2019s an older person\u201d. He went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If she\u2019s in a group that\u2019s vulnerable, then the answer is it might well be prudent - and this will depend entirely on individual circumstances - for her not to get into a situation where she\u2019s putting herself at risk.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Hancock added:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We understand the impact of not being able to hug your closest family. We just hope we can get back to that as soon as possible.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hancock announced that the families of NHS and care staff who have died from coronavirus will receive payments of \u00a360,000.</strong> He said 82 NHS workers and 16 social care staff had died so far. He went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I feel a deep personal sense of duty that we must care for their loved ones. Today, I am able to announce that the government is setting up a life assurance scheme for NHS and social care frontline colleagues. Families of staff who die from coronavirus in the course of their essential frontline work will receive a \u00a360,000 payment.

A total of 321 inmates are confirmed to have contracted coronavirus as of 5pm on Saturday, and 15 have died, the justice secretary has confirmed. As many as 293 prison staff have also tested positive for Covid-19 in 53 jails and five have died.</p> \n  <p>All offenders must pass a risk assessment before their release is approved. But plans to release a \u201csignificant number\u201d over the last week had to be put on hold after six inmates were released by mistake due to an \u201cadministrative error\u201d before being returned to prison, the MoJ said.</p> \n  <p>Answering questions in the House of Commons on Monday, <strong>Justice Secretary Robert Buckland</strong> said: \u201cProgress has, I admit, been careful and slow, but we have reached a position now where, also taking into account the release of pregnant women, a total of 33 prisoners have been released.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s a scheme that I did not embark upon lightly, it is the result of very careful risk assessment, so that we want to minimise any risk to the public, and of course it\u2019s coupled with the reduction that we\u2019ve seen in prison places and prison capacity of about 3,000, which to my judgment and the judgment of those who advise me, is already making a big difference in creating the space that we need in order to increase compartmentalisation and to reduce the spread of the virus.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In another plan, low-risk offenders could be moved into temporary prison cells in the grounds of seven jails so fewer are sharing. Prison charities have launched legal action against the Justice Secretary, claiming measures taken so far to address coronavirus behind bars are \u201cunlawful\u201d because they will have a \u201cmanifestly insufficient impact\u201d.

The letter states:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The three-month time limit for bringing a discrimination or harassment claim is one of the shortest limitation periods for any kind of civil case. The argument for such a limit \u2013 that it encourages the prompt resolution of workplace disputes \u2013 cannot be maintained in current conditions.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The pandemic is making it difficult for those who allege they have been unfairly discriminated against or dismissed to pursue claims. Many law firms have furloughed staff and advice agencies have had to restrict or halt advice clinics during lockdown. The letter adds: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>As the time limit for harassment and discrimination cases runs from what the tribunal concludes is the last unlawful act, this puts individuals without the benefit of specialist legal advice at a particular disadvantage, as they may not be able to identify when their time will run out ...

For example, Johnson has, [Johnson\u2019s biographer Andrew] Gimson told me, always preferred doing \u201ca lot of things imperfectly than one thing perfectly,\u201d choosing to press ahead on the basis of imperfect information rather than waiting until all the facts are clear. In the days and weeks ahead, this carries the risk of overreaching and overpromising \u2013 of moving too quickly based on information that confirms things he wants to be true, but might not be. Of course, this is also a reality of being in charge: As Henry Kissinger has observed, the skill of leadership is to make marginal decisions with imperfect information before others are comfortable doing so, taking a calculated gamble and being willing to stand alone first.</p> \n   <p>Today, the reality of the situation is that when Johnson was admitted to the hospital on 5 April, the death toll in Britain was <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-britain-toll/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-by-621-to-4934-idUSKBN21N0JO\">4,934</a>.

This compares to those aged 40-59 years, who made up 39% of admissions to critical care units, but only constituted 8% of all hospital deaths ...</p> \n   <p>Among the elderly aged 80 or more years there was a peak of deaths on April 8, but there is far less evidence of a subsequent sustained decline in numbers of deaths in this group.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Prof David Leon</strong>, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who led the research, said:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The fact a peak may have been reached on April 8 is not an argument for relaxing social contact.

A second attendee said they were shocked when Cummings first began participating in Sage discussions, in February, because they believed the group should be providing \u201cunadulterated scientific data\u201d without any political input.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-27T11:25:56.922Z\">at 12.25pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea6bc188f0845d1c895e75a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/rorycarroll\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-27T11:04:18.940Z\">12.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A loophole in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland\">Ireland</a>\u2019s lockdown laws means police cannot detain visitors from Northern Ireland, raising concern that some people may cross the border and defy physical distancing regulations.</p> \n  <p>Garda\u00ed have been ordered not to arrest anyone from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland\">Northern Ireland</a> because they have no powers of enforcement over people who do not live in the republic, <a href=\"https://www.rte.ie/news/2020/0425/1134822-garda-headquarters-restrictions/?utm_source=xtremepush&amp;utm_medium=webpush&amp;utm_campaign=Garda%C3%AD+cannot+arrest+Northern+Ireland+day-trippers+for+breaches+of+Covid-19+restrictions%2C+RT%C3%89+learns+%28xtremepush+%2323759747%29&amp;utm_term=notification+%23277021357_1030641281&amp;utm_content=A\">RT\u00c9 reported</a>.</p> \n  <p>The disclosure prompted concern from politicians and residents in Donegal and other border counties that Northern Ireland residents frustrated at the UK\u2019s continued lockdown may visit holiday homes and tour beauty spots in the republic.</p> \n  <p>Residents in the republic are chafing at a ban on travelling more than 2km from home and would bristle at any sign of cross-border visitors taking advantage of the loophole.</p> \n  <p>Sinn F\u00e9in said the loophole reinforced the need for an all-island response to the coronavirus pandemic.

In the three weeks while Johnson has been off work, Dominic Raab, who has been deputising for him, has not given this sort of commitment. The Scottish government <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/binaries/content/documents/govscot/publications/strategy-plan/2020/04/coronavirus-covid-19-framework-decision-making/documents/coronavirus-covid-19-framework-decision-making/coronavirus-covid-19-framework-decision-making/govscot%3Adocument/coronavirus-covid-19-framework-decision-making.pdf?forceDownload=true\">(here)</a> and the Welsh government <a href=\"https://gov.wales/sites/default/files/publications/2020-04/leading-wales-out-of-the-coronavirus-pandemic.pdf\">(here)</a> have both published discussion papers about the issues to be considered as the lockdown gets lifted and Downing Street may be stung by the criticism that it is not consulting the public properly in a similar way. A good example is <a href=\"https://www.nuffieldbioethics.org/news/statement-covid-19-and-the-basics-of-democratic-governance\">this statement</a> from the <strong>Nuffield Council on Bioethics</strong> at the weekend. It says citizens\u2019 assemblies should be used to help determine the path forward.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson claimed that preparations were underway for the easing of the lockdown. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I can tell you now that preparations are under way, and have been for weeks, to allow us to win phase two of this fight, as I believe we are now on track to prevail in phase one.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He did not elaborate, but he will have been referring to things like the ramping up of testing, and the introduction of contact tracing system.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He presented the government\u2019s fight against coronavirus so far as a success. He said:</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We defied so many predictions. We did not run out of ventilators or ICU beds, we did not allow our NHS to collapse, and on the contrary we have so far collectively shielded our NHS so that our incredible doctors and nurses and healthcare staff have been able to shield all of us from an outbreak that would have been far worse, and we collectively flattened the peak.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is one interpretation of events. An alternative view is that the UK has one of the worst coronavirus death rates in Europe, perhaps because it implemented the lockdown later than other countries, and that the government has been behind the curve in implementing testing and stockpiling PPE.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson stressed that he understood the pressure from business for the lockdown to be eased.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>So let me say directly also to British business, to the shopkeepers, to the entrepreneurs, to the hospitality sector, to everyone on whom our economy depends: I understand your impatience, I share your anxiety, and I know that without our private sector without the drive and commitment of the wealth creators of this country there will be no economy to speak of, there will be no cash to pay for our public services no way of funding our NHS, and yes I can see the long term consequences of lock down as clearly as anyone.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This passage seemed to be addressed in particular to Johnson\u2019s colleagues in the Conservative party. \u201cI still a free-market Tory,\u201d he was telling them - while failing to offer them any actual concessions on policy.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He depicted coronavirus as a mugger.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If this virus were a physical assailant, an unexpected and invisible mugger, which I can tell you from personal experience it is, then this is the moment when we have begun together to wrestle it to the floor, and so it follows that this is the moment of opportunity, this is the moment when we can press home our advantage.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He thanks the public for their contribution so far.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Once again, I want to thank you, the people of this country, for the sheer grit and guts, you have shown and are continuing to show.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Every ministerial public statement now contains a passage of thanks to the public like this.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He ended by saying the UK could come out of this stronger.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If we can show the same spirit of unity and determination as we have all shown in the past six weeks, then I have absolutely no doubt that we will beat it together, we will come through this all the faster, and the United Kingdom, will emerge stronger than ever before.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Johnson speeches almost always contain passage of evidence-free utopianism like this one. At a press conference last month he said he was often accused of being \u201cunnecessarily boosterish\u201d. Today\u2019s speech showed that, despite his illness, he has not really changed.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ab5795e02480b12d4f56f861cd366ce8f7361a0\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ab5795e02480b12d4f56f861cd366ce8f7361a0/0_384_7586_4555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson speaking in Downing Street this morning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson speaking in Downing Street this morning.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-27T11:28:36.649Z\">at 12.28pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea6a9e48f0845d1c895e6a1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/damiancarrington\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-27T09:46:38.388Z\">10.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The coronavirus pandemic is likely to be followed by even more deadly and destructive disease outbreaks unless their root cause \u2013 the rampant destruction of the natural world \u2013 is rapidly halted, the world\u2019s leading <strong>biodiversity </strong>experts have warned.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThere is a single species responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 us,\u201d they said. \u201cRecent pandemics are a direct consequence of human activity, particularly our global financial and economic systems that prize economic growth at any cost.

Songs such as Ur Hooyo, Riftoon, Rogaal and Raheye became classics that have been reproduced by Somali musicians of every generation since \u2013 and remain popular still.</p> <p>Although he was better known in Africa and the Middle East, later in life Hudeidi came to prominence further afield, when he moved to London in his 70s and began performing to world music fans and the Somali diaspora at concerts around Europe and the US.</p> <p>Born in Berbera, in the British Somaliland Protectorate, Hudeidi was carried over the Gulf of Aden at 40 days old by his young mother, Qarad Hirsi, to join his father, Ismail Hussein, who was a police sergeant in the Aden Protectorate, which was also under British control. </p> <p>According to his biographer, Sultan Ali Shire, Hudeidi was a boisterous and restless boy, and was first introduced to music by a schoolteacher in Aden, who gave him a drum. At 17 he started playing the violin, and a few years later he bought an oud. He had a short stint in the Royal Navy as a cadet, which took him to Portsmouth in 1948. But his main intent was to become a musician, and in 1952, having left the navy, he was crowned \u201cKing of the Oud\u201d after winning a contest that brought musicians from all over the British empire to Aden. That same year he also established a band called Hawd, which grew into an influential musical and social force in Aden.</p> <p>Hawd was a group of 12 men that performed plays and musicals; the men also taking on female roles, as women were not allowed on stage at the time. It was during his period as an oud player in Hawd that Hudeidi wrote some of his most famous material, including the love song Riftoon, which was named after a French perfume, R\u00e8ve d\u2019Or, that was popular with Adeni women in the 1950s.</p> <p>When the British Somaliland Protectorate became the republic of Somali in 1960, Hudeidi composed a song, Dhalad (literally \u201cto be born\u201d), that was sung as the flag was raised at the new country\u2019s official independence celebrations in the city of Hargeisa. Shortly afterwards he moved from Aden to Hargeisa and began experimenting with his new Qaraami style and embarking on a hugely creative period during which many of his most popular songs were written. </p> <p>In 1961 Hudeidi moved to the nearby state of French Somaliland, joining the anti-colonial struggle there and helping to establish a local orchestra, becoming a folk-hero in the process. His resistance to French rule led to many arrests and periods in detention, until finally he left the country in 1967, still without independence achieved.</p> <p>Back in Somalia, Hudeidi worked as a recording artist for the state-owned radio station and wrote an anti-corruption play, Macal Cune Muuqan Doonee, which he performed in Mogadishu. As a founding member of Waaberi, a national music troupe that brought together many well-known performers, he travelled to the Middle East, Sudan and Nigeria, as well as Zaire, where Waaberi performed on stage in the musical build up to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/04/muhammad-ali-obituary\">Muhammad Ali</a> v George Foreman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/oct/29/rumble-in-the-jungle-muhammad-ali-george-foreman-book-extract\">\u201cRumble in the Jungle\u201d</a> fight in 1974. He also developed close relationships with the Sudanese singer Mohammed Wardi and the Ethiopian songwriter Ali Birra. As Somalia did not have a formal music industry, Hudeidi recorded tracks at home and then cassettes of his music were distributed via cafes and music stalls.</p> <p>In the early 80s, as human rights violations by the mililtary regime in Somalia worsened, Hudeidi questioned the rule of the president, Siad Barre, and contributed to a long collaborative poem (made up of sections composed by different poets and songwriters) that was critical of Barre\u2019s regime. In response the authorities cut his state-sponsored salary by half and he began to be sidelined. Eventually, in 1984, he was forced to flee the country, and he relocated to the former French Somaliland, which had finally become independent (as the republic of Djibouti) in 1977.</p> <p>However, Djibouti was going through its own civil strife, and in 1994, aged 76, Hudeidi ended up as a refugee in London, the last stop in a life that had taken him to many places. In Britain he quickly began to reconnect with other Somali musicians who had been sown to the wind by various conflicts. Despite his age he also travelled widely across Europe, promoting Somali music and performing, in 2009, to an audience of 300,000 at the Mela world music festival in Norway. He also played in the US, in particular in Minneapolis, where many Somali refugees had settled, and was given the freedom of that city in 2004.</p> <p>He taught the oud to young people, often for nothing, and was especially supportive of women playing the instrument, even though this had traditionally been seen as undesirable in his homeland. He was a cosmopolitan and generous-hearted man who used his genius for music as a balm for weary souls and as a weapon against oppression. </p> <p>He is survived by seven children from various marriages.</p> <p>\u2022 Ahmed Ismail Hussein Hudeidi, musician, born 15 April 1928; died 8 April 2020</p>",

The former because it is desperate not to lose out on loads of lovely TV lolly, the latter because they are desperate to divert attention away from the pig\u2019s ear they\u2019ve made of everything Covid-19-related by keeping the proles distracted by some live sporting entertainment on TV.

True, the sight of 22 footballers huffing and puffing around an empty stadium, shouting at each other, sweating profusely, spitting and getting up close and personal with each other is a kind of football entertainment, but considering just one positive test will send the whole house of cards tumbling, is it really so important that we can\u2019t wait until such time as we\u2019ve got a grip on the pandemic before sending our brave boys back out to battle?</p> <p>Of course, we can at least rest assured that any top-flight football that is played will only be done so: a) when tests are readily available; and b) according to strict government guidelines.

Or maybe we are. At a protest where people equate physical distancing with communism.</p> <p>To be fair, Donald Trump did add the helpful caveat: \u201cI\u2019m not a doctor.

But surely we know by now that, with Trump, there is no tipping point. After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/02/donald-trump-racist-claims-mexico-rapes\">calling Mexicans rapists</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">boasting about \u201cpussy grabbing\u201d</a>, his parade of bile and ignorance seems limitless.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know how many psychological profiles I have read of him in which he is diagnosed as a malignant narcissist, or it is suggested he has a cognitive impairment, or suffers from delusional thinking or a sociopathic inability to experience basic empathy.

  "<p>Lockdown is breaking down. Or is it? The Daily Express has pictures of packed beaches in Brighton, yet locals dispute their veracity. Traffic was at its highest over the weekend since restrictions began. Rumours abound that cleaners and nannies are being quietly rehired; that people are visiting loved ones under an array of special circumstances. On Sunday, you could smell the barbecues \u2013 but what were you doing out, within smelling distance, anyway? The guy in front of me in Co-op was buying 48 beers and a tub of ice-cream. But he can\u2019t have been having a party, I decided. No way was that enough ice-cream.</p> <p>In the last days of March, there was huge solidarity around the restrictions themselves: 10 days in, there was a much sourer unity building around censure of the bad people, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/uk-sunbathers-stricter-coronavirus-lockdowns\">the ones </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/uk-sunbathers-stricter-coronavirus-lockdowns\">who were sunbathing</a>. I suspect a new, nudge-nudge-wink-wink solidarity will emerge around noncompliance, which will go head-to-head against the group that remains committed to lockdown. But the lines will be confusing: especially in the US, but also here in Britain, those ideologically most aligned to the government are the ones that reject its proscriptions most strongly. Lockdown is active and collective \u2013 we all have to do it, constantly, for it to exist at all. So the process around it has to be deliberative, just, consensual and transparent \u2013 otherwise the buy-in will evaporate.</p> <p>On Saturday, the Nuffield Council on Bioethics spelled out the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nuffieldbioethics.org/news/statement-covid-19-and-the-basics-of-democratic-governance\">basics of democratic governance</a>\u201d, as they related to Covid-19. There are balances to be struck between different interests and different risks, who and what should be prioritised, who should bear responsibility for what. Following the science \u201cis not politically or morally neutral\u201d. We all need to discuss decisions that affect us all, and to do so we need more information, more openness, more pluralism.</p> <p>This was all so unarguable, so level-headed, that it only became interesting when counterposed against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/27/boris-johnson-uk-beginning-to-turn-the-tide-on-coronavirus\">Boris Johnson\u2019s speech</a> this morning: a huge duvet of flim-flam congratulating us on our national resolve was meant to be warming, but instead felt infantilising and obscure. When the prime minister reached his point, it turned out to be: \u201cWe simply cannot spell out now how fast or slow, or even when, those changes will be made.\u201d While it made no sense on its own terms (\u201ceven when\u201d? What do \u201cfast\u201d and \u201cslow\u201d mean, except \u201cwhen\u201d?), its meaning was quite plain: the government cannot bring you into its decisions; you must prepare yourself to know nothing, until such time as we can tell you something; we will not be pressed on when that will be.</p> <p>There followed some lip service to \u201cmaximum possible transparency\u201d and building \u201cthe biggest possible consensus\u201d. But without any concrete sign of those things, it was simply a demand for ultimate trust. Trust the government to know when the first peak is over. Trust it to know what the second peak will look like. Trust it to evaluate all the trade offs in a democratic way. It\u2019s quite an ask from a government whose basic competence, throughout, has been so questionable.</p> <p>Johnson lacks the personal credibility to beg this confidence, but the inadequacies spread far wider. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is popular in some quarters: others point out that it\u2019s easy to be liked when, every time you open your mouth, it\u2019s to hose money at people (and easy to be disliked, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/applicants-uk-coronavirus-business-loan-cbils\">that money never materialises</a>). Either way, Sunak is completely untested; it would be extraordinary at any time to have such an inexperienced chancellor, let alone now.</p> <p>The key figures of the cabinet, Dominic Raab and Michael Gove, were chosen for their hawkishness on a now completely irrelevant issue, but that trait lingers in both: \u201cI\u2019m in charge, don\u2019t ask questions, leave me alone to get this done.\u201d There were, four months ago, enough people in the country with little enough interest in the future of tedious trade deals that they were prepared to do exactly that. There is nobody with so little to say about their own health and livelihoods that they\u2019ll extend the same blank cheque to a crisis like this one.</p> <p>Below these ministers sits a layer of politicians \u2013 Priti Patel, Matt Hancock, Helen Whately \u2013 who are trying to touch the grace notes of patriotism and self-sacrifice without anything like the gravitas or credibility they need. It\u2019s almost painful to watch, like someone trying to play Mozart\u2019s Requiem on the spoons.</p> <p>Even <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/coronavirus-kremlinesque-how-the-government-tried-to-dismiss-sunday-times-report-bt9dpjmjf\">normally supportive newspapers</a> are beginning to pick apart the competence, honesty and preparedness of the government. Yet what will really damage it is not the failing of any individual or policy, nor that failing coming to light; but rather, its modus operandi, which is built on dominance. We watched a cohort of politicians elevate themselves by their disregard for consensus: it came to be understood that discursive politics was for the good times, and when things got serious, strong men with their bare assertions were required. Of course, the opposite is true: a real crisis needs everyone to cooperate; and for that, everyone must be heard.</p> <p>If Johnson thinks his Downing Street statement bought him time, it didn\u2019t; it fired the starting gun for a race towards some real transparency, a wider debate of maturity and complexity, undertaken with better, fuller information. If he can\u2019t get there by 7 May, when the next review of the lockdown is due, the country will simply outpace him.</p> <p>\u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Wiley\u2019s 11th album arrived in the fires of last decade\u2019s grime renaissance, a revival that saw the genre shatter music industry glass ceilings and swarm across the country. After landmark albums and single releases from Skepta and Stormzy, Wiley followed up with an album heralded as his crowning glory, a deserved victory lap to mark the success of a scene he had sacrificed himself to build: a showcase of the undisputed craftsmanship and erratic genius that has come to define his reign.</p> <p>Wiley\u2019s music is a distinct brand. Over these 17 songs, he swings flow as sharp as a guillotine, razing through high-pitched and adrenaline-fuelled instrumentals. Bring Them All/Holy Grime, a duet with Dagenham MC Devlin, shows Wiley at his most thrilling. The two fence over heady production that sounds like an orchestra on speed. The song carries the dizzying excitement of a skydive, the finesse of an F1 driver \u2013 and yet Wiley starts by mumbling: \u201cDrink \u2018nuff beers before the game, what d\u2019ya call that? Georgie Best MC\u201d, the kind of random cues that underpin his eccentric brilliance.</p> <p>Godfather puts a bow on Wiley\u2019s legacy and sees him connect with successive grime generations. On This is an engrossing, long-awaited reunion with MC prodigies Chip and Ice Kid, who Wiley first took under his wing and up to BBC Radio 1 for<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt9tfVyxggU\"> a now-legendary freestyle session when they were no more than 16</a>. Joe Bloggs is a titanic collaboration with D Double E and Footsie. And the final track, P Money is a tribute to its namesake, arguably grime\u2019s most consistent practitioner in recent times. On a remix for the album, P Money offers a verse of his own.</p> <p>A marriage of the boyish hunger and seasoned wisdom Wiley has honed over decades, Godfather is the high watermark of a prodigious career.</p> <h2><strong>The three to check out next</strong></h2> <p><strong>Treddin\u2019 on Thin Ice (XL Recordings, 2004)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpZGpmTFUdg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MpZGpmTFUdg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Wiley: Eskimo \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>In retrospect, Treddin\u2019 on Thin Ice was less of an earth-shattering debut album proper, more the opening chapter teasing a thrilling catalogue to come. Still, the album features some of Wiley\u2019s \u2013 and grime\u2019s \u2013 most important records. Wot Do U Call It bullishly charts the splintering of UK garage and its winding devolution into what would eventually become grime. Perhaps most critically, the early grime instrumental Eskimo gets an official release. Originally produced around 2002, the arctic instrumental, inspired by Wiley\u2019s fascination with bleak weather and winter, is a cultural artefact that showcases grime in its embryonic form.</p> <p><strong>Playtime Is Over (Big Dada, 2007)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyRiQku-q3g\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YyRiQku-q3g?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Wiley: Slippin \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Around 2007, Wiley was threatening to retire from life as an MC. After Playtime Is Over, he planned a retreat into the shadows, leaving a new breed of MCs to take hold of the scene. Thirteen years later, the album originally pitched as his swan song ranks as one of his finest studio albums. Over a skittish set of largely self-produced songs, we find Wiley surging with composed aggression as he reflects on his life growing up in east London: Nothing About Me and Slippin detail the fears, desires and ambitions that had riddled his life so far.</p> <p><strong>The Best of Tunnel Vision (Eskibeat Recordings, 2007)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4g4DQmDXi0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_4g4DQmDXi0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Wiley: Nan, I Am London \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>For a certain generation, the lore that surrounds Wiley began with the Tunnel Vision series, a string of seminal mixtapes feverishly written and released between 2006 and 2008. The first five emerged in a nine-month period, the kind of divine spark from which miracles are born. Double-disc collection Best of Tunnel Vision contains the scattered jewels from the series. At times it unspools like a diary, sketching intricate portraits of a claustrophobic grime scene and a long-torn relationship with London, as Wiley\u2019s live-wire flow darts around like a stray firecracker.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/24/wiley-godfather-grime\">Wiley: the enigmatic Godfather of Grime</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>One for the heads</strong></h2> <p><strong>Wiley and DJ Score 5 radio set (Rinse FM, 2013)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lnrNAqSF64\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7lnrNAqSF64?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Wiley and DJ Score 5: radio set \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Wiley finds flow states in radio sets and freestyles, unshackled from the confines of choruses and 16-bar verses.

But one morning he abruptly changed his mind and let everybody know via Twitter that he was back in the country and looking to be interviewed that same morning. Joe Walker, then of RWD Magazine (now of Beats 1), took up the call.

  "<p>Jumping into a turquoise infinity lake at the top of a Oaxacan mountain, Dom and his sister, Lizzie, are awestruck. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen anything as beautiful as that in my entire life,\u201d Dom says. \u201cI\u2019d have been gutted if we\u2019d missed this.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, two rivals in their adventure, the married couple Jen and Robbie, are hot, sweaty and weighed down by their giant rucksacks on the outskirts of Mexico City. They have mistakenly travelled to a metro station, rather than an international bus terminal 100km (62 miles) away. \u201cOh my God,\u201d fumes Jen. \u201cWhere\u2019s the bloody bus station? We\u2019re LOST.\u201d</p> <p>Anyone who has strapped on a backpack and boarded a 6am long-haul flight will have nodded in recognition all the way through the latest series of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/21/race-across-the-world\">Race Across </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/21/race-across-the-world\">the World</a> (BBC Two). As the contestants soon found out, that is the thing with travel: sometimes you accidentally discover a hidden wonder of the world, other times you are sunburnt and on the edge of a breakdown at a ticketing booth.</p> <p>Perhaps it was this sense of holiday deja vu \u2013 alongside the heartwarming displays of kindness from strangers \u2013 that made more than 4 million people watch the five couples, unaided by smartphones or air travel, race 25,000km through Latin America.</p> <p>Halfway through the series\u2019 broadcast, the Covid-19 pandemic spread rapidly, prompting most countries to lock down and suspend international travel. With each following episode, Race Across the World took on a bittersweet quality, as journeying so freely \u2013 and being within touching distance of strangers! \u2013 instantly looked as if it were from another era. While only one couple took home the \u00a320,000 prize in Sunday\u2019s episode (no spoilers ahead), the greater prize for all the contestants was being among the last people \u2013 for a while, at least \u2013 able to explore the world on a whim.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fca0960912792d1e3cab838deb71c9ad57eef501\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fca0960912792d1e3cab838deb71c9ad57eef501/0_0_4284_2856/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sam (left) and Jo in Race Across the World series two.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Travel TV is a window on the world that awaits us all\u2019 ...

Lizzie agrees: \u201cIt definitely makes it seem more epic than we ever realised before.\u201d They add that the show \u2013 and those 28-hour bus rides \u2013 unwittingly prepared them for life in isolation: \u201cWe are both quite used to waiting now \u2013 but at least we have the comfort of our phones, TV, beds and proper meals. We\u2019re still bickering every day, though \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Tim Harcourt, the show\u2019s executive producer, says: \u201cWatching the show back now, it reminds me that we all took our freedom to travel for granted. But I hope the series serves as inspiration that\u2019s especially needed during these times. Families and young people especially are tapping into these shared experiences and discovering the world the only way they can at the moment \u2013 through exciting, adrenaline-filled travel TV.\u201d</p> <p>With holidays cancelled, weddings and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/18/glastonbury-festival-postponed-due-to-coronavirus\">festivals postponed</a> and people having no idea when they will be allowed to leave their home towns, Harcourt is right in that viewers are looking to TV to transport them across continents and cultures.</p> <p>Historically, travel on TV has been a form of escapism or inspiration. In the late 60s and 70s, bright, magazine-like shows such as Holiday and Wish You Were Here\u2026? promoted the wave of cheap charter flights and package holidays in Europe. In the 00s, things shifted to reality TV competitions such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jul/14/million-miles-love-island-shipwrecked-reality-tv\">Shipwrecked</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/nov/05/how-coach-trip-picked-up-teens-and-ran-out-of-gas\">Coach Trip</a>.</p> <p>These shows are broadcast alongside celebrity travelogues from stalwarts such as Michael Palin, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/10/joanna-lumleys-japan-review-an-absolutely-fabulous-travel-companion\">Joanna Lumley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/dec/13/billy-connollys-ultimate-world-tour-review-a-reflective-reminder-of-his-brilliance\">Billy Connolly</a>, through to Jack Whitehall, Russell Howard and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/18/japan-with-sue-perkins-review-cute-candid-and-heavy-on-the-cliches\">Sue Perkins</a>. Channel 4\u2019s successful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/mar/23/travel-man-richard-ayoade-and-his-famous-friends-are-hilarious-tour-guides-for-armchair-travellers\">Travel Man series</a> \u2013 which has been running since 2015 \u2013 announced a change in presenter from Richard Ayoade to Joe Lycett last year. But with most on-location TV grounded like the airlines, what does the future hold for our armchair travels on screen?</p> <p>Foodie jet-setters can still torment themselves by watching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/03/the-trip-to-greece-review-coogan-and-brydon-have-the-midas-touch\">the final series of The Trip</a> \u2013 in which Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon eat in fancy restaurants around Europe, doing Marlon Brando impressions \u2013 which aired on Sky earlier this month, mid-quarantine.</p> <p>Josh Hyams, a producer on The Trip to Greece, is in the early stages of developing another travel series. He says: \u201cWhen I watch The Trip again, it feels like glimpsing back to an easier and less complicated time. Coronavirus has rendered making a travel show like this impossible for the moment.</p> <p>\u201cI hope that, once the virus has passed, we can rely on travel shows coming back as before. However, the problem will always be whether one can get insurance that covers a production for any outbreak or delays. That will determine when a show will be able to come back.\u201d</p> <p>The BBC\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/why-a-pilgrimage-was-good-practice-for-lockdown\">Pilgrimage: The Road to Istanbul</a> also experienced a similar strange shift in world-changing events midway through transmission. But its executive producer, Caroline Matthews, believes the timing of the series\u2019 broadcast \u2013 in which seven celebrities walked the Sultan\u2019s Trail from Serbia to Turkey \u2013 and its theme of peaceful contemplation struck a chord with viewers in lockdown: \u201cI saw on Twitter that quite a few people have been commenting on the<strong> </strong>mindfulness and spirituality that\u2019s kind of been resonating with everybody at the moment because we\u2019re going through such tough times,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Matthews says they would have expected to be in the development stage for the fourth series \u2013 which films in September \u2013 but this has been put on hold. \u201cWe do have a slight advantage in that a pilgrimage is all about physical distancing and isolation by its nature.\u201d</p> <p>On the issue of the need to be mindful about bringing a cast and crew into remote areas in future, she adds: \u201cWe have a skeletal crew \u2013 the minimal amount of people to deliver the show, anyway. We\u2019re just going to have to be more creative and resourceful in how we film \u2013 splitting into smaller groups and a lot more self-shot. We always use local runners, crew and drivers, too.\u201d</p> <p>Producers will no doubt be looking to the travel industry for guidance, as it tries to work out how it can function after the pandemic. Fiona Reece, the founder of the PR and content agency <a href=\"https://www.traveltonic.co.uk/\">Travel Tonic</a>, says: \u201cThere\u2019s still a huge appetite for exploration, but I think, post-corona, people might feel nervous about travelling again. There\u2019s nothing on television that really exists to give people advice on how to book, where would be safe to travel to. I think this crisis has really highlighted the need for advice on TV shows again, like we used to see with Holiday or Wish You Were Here..?\u201d</p> <p>Reece believes the focus will be on UK-based holidays: \u201cSome people will want to go back to their favourite places, such as Devon and Cornwall, but others will want to go where they can escape the crowds. I think there\u2019s going to be much more interest in remote places, plus glamping, camping and road-tripping in camper vans to explore the British Isles.\u201d</p> <p>Matthews is also looking at filming on home turf again: \u201cWhen lockdown is lifted, we\u2019ll start work on locations. At the moment, we\u2019re looking at pilgrimages abroad and in the UK. Maybe this is where we all fall back in love with the UK again.\u201d</p> <p>As for Race Across the World, plans for the first celebrity version were postponed in March, but Harcourt remains optimistic: \u201cWe haven\u2019t started casting for the next series, but I am confident we will be ready to go as soon as travel restrictions are lifted for one of the routes we want.</p> <p>\u201cTravel TV is a window on the world that awaits us all. The effort to overcome this crisis needs to be a team like those trying to win Race Across the World \u2013 we need good communication, patience, risk aversion, foresight and planning, coupled with a bit of luck.\u201d</p> <p><em>Race Across the World: Revealed is on BBC Two</em><em> on 3 May at 8pm; </em><em>series\u2019 one and two are available </em><em>in full on <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m0002tvs/race-across-the-world\">BBC iPlayer</a></em></p> <p><br></p>",

For me, while walking the streets, enjoying my government-sanctioned exercise, these homemade works have become a raw expression of our time: a collective action during a moment of ubiquitous tragedy.</p> <p>Long encouraging the arts as a way of working through tricky stuff has been the Gate, a drop-in centre in London\u2019s Shepherd\u2019s Bush for adults with learning disabilities, offering art classes and music sessions.

  "<p>With the shutters down on high streets and retail parks around the world, meaning that home delivery is the only option for almost anything other than food and medicine, it\u2019s no surprise that Amazon is seeing business boom. The online retailer, already a one-stop shop for many people, has seen customers flock through its virtual doors in the weeks since coronavirus hit.</p> <p>The site is experiencing an extended period of sales at the level usually reserved for the shopping frenzy of Black Friday, with reported surges reaching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/15/amazon-lockdown-bonanza-jeff-bezos-fortune-109bn-coronavirus\">$11,000 (\u00a38,800) a second</a>. Its share price is booming, too, making its already rich founder, Jeff Bezos, even richer.</p> <p>But while the site offers everything you could need at the moment, from food to films, via fish tanks and photo frames, there are many who feel uncomfortable about adding to its dominance. Concerns about its treatment of workers, how little tax it pays and its impact on smaller retailers are not new, but this crisis has shone the spotlight on them again.</p> <p>In the US, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/20/amazon-warehouse-workers-sickout-coronavirus\">some Amazon workers are protesting against their treatment</a>, accusing the company of putting revenue above safety by not supplying enough face masks or checking that employees are not sick when they turn up to work.</p> <p>In December, the UK campaign group <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/02/new-study-deems-amazon-worst-for-aggressive-tax-avoidance\">Fair Tax Mark put</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/02/new-study-deems-amazon-worst-for-aggressive-tax-avoidance\"> Amazon at the top of a list of companies that it said were \u201caggressively avoiding\u201d tax</a>, saying it had paid just $3.4bn in tax on revenues of $960.5bn and profits of $26.8bn. With countries needing to rebuild their finances after the crisis, attention is likely to fall on corporations that are not seen to be paying their fair share.</p> <p>It is also worth remembering that however quick the delivery might be, it is not always as handy as being able to go to a shop and bring something home straight away. We will, one day, be back to that situation, so it is worth protecting your local retailers in the short term if you can. It is also worth looking for online alternatives.</p> <p><strong>Electronics</strong></p> <p>You can often cut out the middleman if you are buying electronics. For computers, phones and TVs, <a href=\"https://www.dell.com/en-uk?~ck=mn\">Dell</a>, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/\">Apple</a> and <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/\">Samsung</a> are all offering free delivery on their products, although Samsung has suspended orders to Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Scottish Highlands. For gaming, <a href=\"https://store.nintendo.co.uk/nintendo-switch/nintendo-switch-lite/consoles.list\">Nintendo has the Switch Lite for sale</a> on its website, although the Switch is out of stock.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.box.co.uk/\">Box.co.uk</a> sells kitchen appliances such as toasters and coffee makers alongside gaming consoles, TVs and computers from its base in Birmingham. Free delivery takes five days, but you can pay to get items the next day. During the crisis the <a href=\"https://www.box.co.uk/bursary\">company is offering a total of \u00a310,000-worth of products to deserving individuals</a> who are nominated through the website.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/index.html\">Currys PC World</a> is taking orders and has a sale on some of the equipment that you might be looking for at the moment, including printers, wifi extenders and coffee machines. Next-day delivery costs \u00a35; standard delivery is free, but will take five to 10 days.</p> <p>John Lewis is offering free standard delivery on orders over \u00a350 or next-day delivery for \u00a36.95. It is not offering two-person deliveries, and is calling ahead to check whether customers are self-isolating. Orders can be delivered to Waitrose, Co-op and Booths stores, too.</p> <p>It is worth seeing if independent retailers near you are still operating. In Carlisle, for example, <a href=\"https://www.athomepc.co.uk/\">@Home PC</a> is advertising contact-free delivery on laptops and accessories.</p> <p>In the US, you can find most electronic goods on <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/\">Best Buy</a>, which has an Amazon-price-match guarantee. With an added in-store Geek Squad to deal with all your electronic woes (once the shutdown is over, of course), it strikes a nice balance between online convenience and in-store customer service. It is currently offering curbside deliveries, too, which helps to keep you and your courier safe.</p> <p><strong>Household products</strong></p> <p>Environmentally friendly cleaning products, pet food and baby gear are available at <a href=\"https://www.ethicalsuperstore.com/\">Ethicalsuperstore.com</a>. Standard delivery in the UK is free on orders over \u00a350, or \u00a33.95 on smaller orders. It is a good place to buy in bulk \u2013 Ecover laundry liquid, for example, is available in a range of sizes up to 15 litres, which sells for \u00a349.59. Its <a href=\"https://www.ethicalsuperstore.com/covid-19-update/\">website has a lengthy description</a> of what it is doing to keep staff safe.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.wilko.com/\">Wilko\u2019s stores</a> are still open, and so is its online shop. It is offering delivery within seven days for a \u00a35 fee. Cleaning products, pet food and nappies are all available, as well as items from its DIY, gardening and stationery ranges. However, the virtual toiletries aisle looks pretty bare (when we checked, most toothpaste and shower gel was out of stock).</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.viking-direct.co.uk/en/viking-advantages\">Viking-direct.co.uk</a> usually supplies offices, but individuals can register. It sells all kinds of things you might need at work, home or the current hybrid of the two, including bin liners, dishwasher tablets, toilet rolls and biscuits. Delivery is free on orders over \u00a330 and is usually next day.</p> <p>For US customers, <a href=\"https://www.target.com/\">Target </a>has it all, from nappies to kids\u2019 toys to groceries. The store lets you select items by delivery option, including same-day delivery and store pickup. The same-day option uses Shipt, meaning free delivery for Shipt members, or those using a free trial; the free trial lasts four weeks. If you are not a Shipt member, the markup is applied per item, so it can end up getting pricey. Currently, you can expect purchases made at the beginning of the week to be delivered at the end of the week \u2013 but these windows are particularly sensitive to change at the moment.</p> <p><strong>Beauty and personal care</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.superdrug.com/\">Superdrug</a>\u2019s shops are open, and it is running a same-day delivery service from some shops via a courier firm called <a href=\"https://www.superdrug.com/stuart-delivery\">Stuart</a>. The delivery charge starts at \u00a35.40. You need to check that it works from a local branch before you make your order. If it doesn\u2019t, you can use the usual delivery service, which is free for loyalty card holders on orders over \u00a310 and for everyone spending more than \u00a315.</p> <p>For high-end beauty items, take a look at the companies\u2019 own sites. <a href=\"https://www.clarins.co.uk/\">Clarins</a>\u2019 online shop is still open, for instance, and delivery is free on orders over \u00a350. <a href=\"https://www.benefitcosmetics.com/uk/en-gb/bestsellers/whats-new\">Benefit</a> warns that its orders are taking a couple of weeks to arrive, but it does have a sale on so it may be worth the wait.</p> <p>For electric toothbrushes, razors and the like, manufacturers often offer direct sales. <a href=\"https://www.philips.co.uk/\">Philips</a> is offering free delivery on a range that includes personal care items, baby bottle sterilisers and very upmarket juicers. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.very.co.uk/\">Very.co.uk</a> is effectively an online department store, with a huge range of beauty products at different price points, and tech from men\u2019s grooming products to hairdryers. It also stocks toys, appliances and a small range of DVDs and music.</p> <p>In the US, <a href=\"https://community.sephora.com/t5/COVID-19/Store-Closure-COVID-19-Update/m-p/5228757\">Sephora offers high-street and luxury beauty products</a>. Sephora is a multinational chain, so unlike platforms where you buy from individual sellers, there is less reason to worry about counterfeit products. Plus you get two free samples with every order. Standard shipping orders can take up to two weeks to arrive, or you can choose a range of <a href=\"https://www.sephora.com/beauty/shipping-information\">speedier delivery options</a>, normally at a higher cost.</p> <p>Depop is like eBay, but for trendy clothing and beauty products. The platform has listings from a range of individual sellers and stores, and there are star ratings so you can choose to buy from trusted sellers. Purchases are protected by PayPal. </p> <p><strong>Entertainment</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s hard to avoid Amazon if you want to watch something that it has bought the rights for, but for films and music there are many other options.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/\">BFI has new and classic films to rent on its website</a>. One-off rentals start at \u00a32.50 each, or a subscription offers older films. That costs \u00a34.99 a month, but there is a 14-day free trial at the start.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.curzonhomecinema.com/content/in-cinemas-now\">Curzon</a> is offering the cinema experience at home, with very recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/01/portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire-review-celine-sciamma\">films such as Portrait of a Lady on Fire</a> available to stream for less than \u00a310. You don\u2019t need to subscribe to watch, and there is a free film when you register your details.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.cinemaparadiso.co.uk/\">Cinema Paradiso</a> has a wider range of films and TV programmes, but this is a DVD rental service so you can\u2019t watch straight away. Again there is a 14-day free trial; the monthly cost depends on which subscription you choose. The basic one is \u00a35.99 and offers two rentals a month.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.zavvi.com/\">Zavvi</a> is not on the high street any longer, but lives online selling DVDs, music and games \u2013 both electronic and board. You can buy a delivery pass for \u00a39.99, which gives you standard delivery for a year and reduces the cost of the next-day service. It is warning that, to protect staff, orders are taking 48 hours longer than usual.</p> <p><a href=\"https://store.hmv.com/\">HMV</a> does most of its business online these days, too, and is another option if you don\u2019t need to watch something straight away.</p> <p><strong>Books</strong></p> <p>Last week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/23/amazon-mystery-250000-pound-donor-to-uk-bookshops\">Amazon was revealed to be the mystery donor of \u00a3250,000</a> to a fund to help bookshops suffering hardship. The organisers welcomed the gesture, while also noting that there was still \u201cno greater threat to high-street bookselling\u201d than the US giant.</p> <p>Books are in fact some of the easiest items to find a good alternative source for. Many independent shops are offering deliveries \u2013 a lot will order titles for you even if they don\u2019t have them in stock. You can find local shops <a href=\"https://www.booksellers.org.uk/home#\">via the Booksellers Association\u2019s website</a>.</p> <p>There are also online-only shops such as Wordery.com, which has more than 10m books available and also some notebooks and a very small number of games. It offers free delivery worldwide, although there is quite a <a href=\"https://wordery.com/covid-19-statement\">long list of countries that it cannot currently send books to</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.biggreenbookshop.com/\">The Big Green Bookshop</a> will order what you want and get it sent to you. It runs a weekly \u201cbuy a stranger a book\u201d scheme on its website and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Biggreenbooks?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Twitter feed</a>, so if you have spare cash you can treat someone else.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.hive.co.uk/\">Hive.co.uk</a> is selling ebooks and books for home delivery and paying double commission to the smaller bookshops it normally uses for collection service. It is currently taking orders only for the UK and relies on Royal Mail for deliveries, so how long your order takes will vary depending on your local service. You can choose which shop the commission goes to, so if your local shop is not currently trading, this is a way to get some money to it. It usually sells CDs and DVDs, too, so keep an eye out in case they are added to its offering.</p> <p><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/\">The Guardian Bookshop</a> supports the newspaper and offers books at a discount. There is currently 20% off children\u2019s activity books, which could prove handy. Delivery is free on orders of \u00a315 or more.</p> <p>For ebooks, many libraries, for instance, are offering loans online \u2013 check out your local council\u2019s website for details. It is possible to <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/246323/how_to_convert_an_ebook_to_the_amazon_kindle_format.html\">convert ebooks bought elsewhere</a> to Kindle\u2019s format using free software <a href=\"https://calibre-ebook.com/\">such as Calibre</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ebooks.com/\">Ebooks.com</a> serves customers around the world and has titles starting at 99p in the UK. It has <a href=\"https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/retailers/shopping-guide/booksellers\">got the thumbs-up from Ethical Consumer magazine</a> and is the only ebook seller in its top five.</p> <p>Through <a href=\"https://www.indiebound.org/\">Indiebound</a>, readers in the US can search for and buy from independent booksellers. You can search by zip code or store name \u2013 in case you are looking to support a particular store. Speed and cost of shipping depends on the bookstore.</p> <p>Alternatively, <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/\">Bookshop</a> is a platform that has been set up to help independent stores make a profit. Stores earn 30% commission on any sales they generate, while Bookshop handles the packing, shipping and returns for them and runs the website. It also puts 10% of its non-bookstore affiliated sales into an overall earnings pool that is evenly divided up and shared with participating stores every six months. In March, <a href=\"https://nerdist.com/article/bookshop-new-independent-bookstore-retailer/\">it raised more than $230,000 for independent stores</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 5 May 2020 to remove an incorrect reference to only being able to buy Kindle versions of ebooks on Amazon.</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>Ross Island is beautifully bleak. It is home to penguins, seals, volcanoes and two Antarctic research bases. Keri, who is American and works for the US Antarctic Program, was running the stores and other services at <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mcmurdo-station\">McMurdo </a><a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mcmurdo-station\">station</a>. Alex, a Briton who was doing a PhD in sea-ice physics, was 1.9 miles (3km) away at New Zealand\u2019s Scott Base. They met in February 2009, as winter was approaching. But dating in Antarctica was tricky. \u201cYou don\u2019t get your hopes up about anybody there,\u201d says Alex. Isolated in a cold little bubble with a fairly transient community, people fall in and out of love quickly.</p> <p>There was a lot of interaction between the two bases, which is how they stumbled across each other \u2013 although neither remembers the exact moment. \u201cIf there was any big event happening at either base, it was made with the other station in mind. I would say at least once a month there would be something,\u201d says Keri. Sometimes the two bases would play each other at volleyball. Alex sometimes noticed her at the bar. \u201cBut other people, too,\u201d he says, and Keri laughs.</p> <p>The US base held a Fourth of July party. \u201cI think we decided we should get to know each other a little bit more,\u201d says Keri. They ended up talking for much of the night. \u201cWe came from really different backgrounds \u2013 I grew up on a farm in Minnesota and Alex went to grammar schools in England.\u201d She remembers him \u201cplaying footsie with me under the coffee table\u201d. At the end of the night, says Alex, \u201cmost people went home and I made the excuse that I didn\u2019t really want to go back to Scott Base that night; it was quite late\u201d.</p> <p>Keri liked Alex\u2019s intelligence: \u201cI felt we were on the same wavelength.\u201d Alex also appreciated how clever she was, \u201cbut in a different way\u201d from him. \u201cI\u2019m a logical, science guy and Keri has these great insights into how people behave. She is a fascinating person. I think we just clicked and we keep surprising each other.\u201d</p> <p>They got together that night. \u201cWe weren\u2019t sure if anything else would happen, but I kept going to see Keri and Keri kept coming to see me,\u201d says Alex. They would meet a couple of times a week, with Alex usually making the relatively short (but sometimes -40C) trek between the stations, often in snow storms, or kite-skiing across the sea ice \u2013 because Keri had lettuce. \u201cLettuce is valuable down there,\u201d says Keri. \u201cWe had a greenhouse at McMurdo station, so I would take my share and save it until Alex came over and we would sit on the couch and eat it.\u201d</p> <p>He would bring her small presents \u2013 gingerbread men, a stuffed elephant. When you pack for a stint in Antarctica, many people bring small gifts to give to their friends and colleagues whenever they need a little lift. \u201cKeri got most of them,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Sometimes they would both set out from their respective bases at the same time and meet in the middle. \u201cThe auroras would be going off above our head, so we would watch that together,\u201d says Keri. \u201cWe found patches of snow and pretended we were penguins and slid down the hill. It was very cute and almost makes me want to barf.\u201d She laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t think either of us were really serious about each other at that point. It was just an Antarctica winter thing that was happening.\u201d</p> <p>Once their time there was over, Keri went back to the US and Alex to university in New Zealand, so they started a long-distance relationship. Keri returned to work in Antarctica the following winter, still not sure if their relationship would work long-term, but there was no pressure from either of them. \u201cThe idea that we were probably going to break up meant that if we didn\u2019t feel like breaking up, that was cool, too,\u201d she says. Alex says: \u201cIt was always worth waiting for Keri.\u201d They got married five years ago and now live in San Francisco.</p> <p>Their longest stint together has been 14 months; most years, Keri goes back to Antarctica for about six months. Video calls from the base are rationed, but they keep in daily contact by phone and messages. \u201cIt was always expected that Keri would keep doing this, so we both understand the situation we\u2019re in,\u201d says Alex. It helps that they are independent people, says Keri. \u201cWe both haven\u2019t cared very much about the way things are \u2018supposed\u2019 to be. We like our alone time.\u201d Then, says Alex, \u201cyou meet each other again and you get to fall in love again\u201d.</p> <ul> <li><p>Want to share your story?

  "<p>\u201cI\u2019m only 32 but I feel like I\u2019ve experienced a lot more, like 200 years of life, in bad ways and good ways,\u201d Nadia Nadim says near the end of an hour\u2011long conversation that has been more exhilarating than sobering. We have moved from the way her life \u201cchanged in the blink of an eye\u201d when the Taliban stopped her going to school at the age of 11 and then murdered her father.</p> <p>She has reflected on how her mother found a way to help her and her four sisters flee Afghanistan. We have remembered how she <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHdFAbgIx0I\" title=\"\">fell for football in a refugee camp</a> in Denmark and her life changed for ever. Nadim has since played 93 times for Denmark and, as a prolific goalscorer, become one of the world\u2019s most significant women footballers.</p> <p>She has played professionally in Denmark, New Jersey, Portland, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bszCWeB0pfQ\" title=\"\">Manchester</a> and now Paris where she helped PSG reach the Champions League quarter-finals. They were due to face Arsenal last month. She speaks seven languages fluently and is one semester from graduating as a reconstructive surgeon. Meanwhile, during this interview, she swears like a trooper and makes me laugh. Nadim is at home with her family in Denmark, finding solace and hope in lockdown life while reflecting on a past like no other.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/29/many-womens-football-clubs-are-short-of-backroom-staff-fifpro-survey-says\">Many women's football clubs are short of backroom staff, Fifpro survey says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhen I have time to reflect I\u2019m like: \u2018Holy shit!\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think many people can say they\u2019ve experienced all this in their entire lifetime. I don\u2019t want to sound arrogant but I think I have more insight than most people when it comes to other human beings, culture, religion, language. This has been built inside me from different worlds. Does that make sense?\u201d</p> <p>It does because we\u2019ve just discussed how retirement from football will be more bearable for Nadim because she can replace one form of intensity with another. When a career ends for most footballers they understandably lament the fact nothing will match the sensations they experience on the pitch. It is different for Nadim. Working <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/video/c/nadia-nadim-talks-about-training-to-be-a-surgeon/vp-AAEH4X5\" title=\"\">as a surgeon</a> will feel even more dramatic than playing for PSG or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAubDsltNDU\" title=\"\">scoring the opening goal</a> in the European Championship final as she did when Denmark <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/aug/06/womens-euro-2017-holland-denmark-match-report\" title=\"\">faced the Netherlands</a> in 2017.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A girl from Pakistan said my story inspired her to keep playing football.

Not so long ago I played a game and I was really tired but soon after the game I assisted one of our doctors in a kidney surgery. I was standing there for two hours, in the same position, holding an instrument so he could see better. I was hurting everywhere because of the match but I still was feeling so great and my pulse was racing.</p> <p>\u201cI had this rush of adrenaline, thinking: \u2018Holy shit, this is so cool. I\u2019m literally looking inside someone\u2019s stomach.\u2019\u201d Nadim laughs, as she does with infectious frequency, before becoming more thoughtful. \u201cThere will come a time as a surgeon when all the responsibility is on me and it\u2019s going to be more extreme than anything I\u2019ve experienced.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2db873e24ce41aee1f32a44bdc145cf618eeefb9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2db873e24ce41aee1f32a44bdc145cf618eeefb9/0_166_4962_2976/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nadia Nadim celebrates after scoring for Denmark. \u2018I experience similar emotions or adrenaline rush inside the operating room,\u2019 she says.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nadia Nadim celebrates after scoring for Denmark. \u2018I experience similar emotions or adrenaline rush in the operating room,\u2019 she says.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henning Bagger/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I once wrote <a href=\"https://www.donaldmcrae.com/book-every-second-counts-about.php\" title=\"\">a book about heart transplant surgeons</a> and so I know even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/oct/06/zlatan-ibrahimovic-trash-talking-sweden-record-golascorer\" title=\"\">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a> would seem self-effacing if he ended up in this different world. Surgeons can be fascinating company but they are invariably driven by huge ego. \u201cI\u2019ve experienced that as well,\u201d Nadim says. \u201cI don\u2019t know if reconstructive surgeons have the biggest egos but you need huge confidence when cutting up a human being. You have to fix the situation. These no-shit doctors inspire me. I\u2019ve always been near doctors who are headstrong and know what they\u2019re going to do, and how they\u2019re going to do it.\u201d</p> <p>Great footballers also have swaggering confidence. \u201cDefinitely. I\u2019ve not seen anyone with low confidence make a big difference in football. If I see someone shaking, I\u2019m not going to think: \u2018Oh, I have such confidence in you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>But there is also a necessary tenderness within reconstructive surgery. Rebuilding a face or a limb after a car crash or bombing requires delicate work amid devastation. It is work for which Nadim is equipped because her compassion runs even deeper than her confidence. \u201cI know the value of helping a person when they have no hope. I\u2019m a walking reminder of that. All the help I was given in my life made me the person I am today. So I really want to offer this help. Someone\u2019s face can be blown up and it\u2019s hard for them to exist. I\u2019m going to give them some of their identity back.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af9d1696550045f712c2612d2721ae71daf88bf9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af9d1696550045f712c2612d2721ae71daf88bf9/0_0_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nadia Nadim in action for PSG against Lyon this season.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nadia Nadim in action for PSG against Lyon this season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fred Tanneau/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nadim\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p082gx1t\" title=\"\">personal story</a> is worth examining if you\u2019ve not heard it before but we both want to talk more about the lesser-known corners of her experience. Rather than reliving the nightmare of how the Taliban made her father disappear when she was 12, Nadim discusses more complicated feelings. When her mum looks at her and considers the courage and fire which have enabled her to achieve so much over the past 20 years, she sees Nadim\u2019s father.</p> <p>\u201cIt makes me happy,\u201d Nadim says \u201cbecause I remember most that he was a cool person. He could do everything. On the other hand I\u2019m sad because for the majority of my life I haven\u2019t experienced my dad. Even the time I did experience, most of it I don\u2019t remember because I was young. I still have my mother and she\u2019s a really cool lady. Even before the Taliban came, she knew the power of education. That\u2019s something she\u2019s really given to us. She also used to try to teach other kids in Afghanistan. It takes one person to make a change and she\u2019ll always try to be that person.\u201d</p> <p>Nadim has changed lives. She tells a story of how, during last year\u2019s World Cup, she spoke on a panel about empowering young women through football. \u201cI\u2019m sitting among all these beautiful ladies from around the world and everyone starts sharing their stories about what they had to overcome to play football. At first I thought it was really sad. Nowadays we\u2019re fighting for equality, especially in terms of pay, which is great, but in other parts of the world women and girls are not even allowed to touch a fucking ball. It\u2019s crazy.</p> <p>\u201cThis girl put her hand up. She\u2019s from Pakistan. She starts half\u2011crying, saying: \u2018I can\u2019t believe Nadia Nadim is here.\u2019 She says how she used to play football in this tiny town but everyone was saying girls could not play football because of her Muslim background. She said: \u2018I was about to run away and never play the game again but I came across your story and it made me believe I can play football, too.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a really emotional person but I don\u2019t cry easily in front of people but she made me tear up. Here we have this young girl from Pakistan saying: \u2018You saved my life. I play football now and I\u2019ve started a team in the area. This is thanks to you. You told your story and you said it was hard but if you really love something, you should push it.\u2019 So many people don\u2019t care what girls go through around the world but it\u2019s not impossible to get out of it and it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s football or anything else you believe in. You have to maintain the hope.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a19f22adccec42651853f5acb174fbe57f0caca6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a19f22adccec42651853f5acb174fbe57f0caca6/0_145_4300_2580/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nadia Nadim training in January.

Football has opened up the world to her and yet now, like the rest of us in lockdown, she is cut off from the game she loves. \u201cI really miss it. Playing football with my teammates, playing the big matches. But we live in the country, so I can be outside playing football on my own like a kid. Before our interview I was out there for more than an hour, juggling, trying to learn new stuff. It\u2019s cool.</p> <p>\u201cIf I was in Paris it would be a different story. You live in an apartment and can\u2019t go out. Denmark was one of the countries that reacted really quick [to Covid-19], so we managed the situation really well. The numbers are flattening and we\u2019re slowly opening up society againWe\u2019re getting there.\u201d</p> <p>Nadim exclaims when I say it\u2019s not easy in the US when Donald Trump, who last week suggested that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/trump-disinfectant-bleach-sarcastic\" title=\"\">injecting disinfectant might cure</a> coronavirus, is in power. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy! Excuse my language but how the fuck is it possible he is in charge? Maybe this is a wake-up call to the world. Lots of other diseases are going down in terms of the people they kill \u2013 like influenza. In Denmark it\u2019s been dramatically decreased and that\u2019s because people are starting to be more aware of hygiene.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t think this is the last time we\u2019re going to be seeing this kind of pandemic. We have to start preparing for the future because it might get even worse. Before, when people [in the west] saw news about other countries at war or experiencing misery it seemed alien. They\u2019re just in the background \u2013 \u2018These poor kids in Africa or Afghanistan.\u2019 No one really cares. I hope this brings the compassion and empathy that was being lost in our world.</p> <p>\u201cLike what does it mean to be human? It means you care for others. So even if you\u2019re healthy and strong and seem to have no symptoms you need to stay home to save someone else. It\u2019s not about you any more. </p> <p>Right now you can bitch about being at home and think: \u2018Oh, my life sucks.\u2019 But you can also be grateful you live in a society where you can stay at home and still have food and something over your head. If you get sick there are doctors who are going to do their best to help you.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s in your hands how you look at it. I still have hopes and dreams. I don\u2019t know when we will get back to normal and I don\u2019t really care because I\u2019m living right now. I\u2019m making the most of it. I\u2019m going to do my best to have a better future and an even better day tomorrow.\u201d</p>",

And for some, violence continued to haunt them even after their arrival.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I first arrived here in Oakland, I felt less safe than in Guatemala,\u201d student Kevin Xiloj said in Spanish, his second language after the native indigenous language K\u2019iche.</p> <p>Xiloj left Guatemala when he was 17 to get away from the gangs that dominated his rough neighborhood in the city of Huehuetenango. But when he finally made it to East Oakland in 2015, he was greeted by frequent gunfire in his new neighborhood.</p> <p>He said his American peers mocked him for not speaking English and were eager to pick fights. Xiloj followed the same rules he had learned growing up in Huehuetenango: Listen. Watch. Stay quiet.</p> <p>Yet he found Oakland\u2019s unfamiliar streets more intimidating. At least back in Huehuetenango, Xiloj explained, \u201cI knew people, I knew my neighborhood, I knew who was who.\u201d</p> <p>Even as the gun homicide rate in Oakland fell by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2019/jun/03/gun-violence-bay-area-drop-30-percent-why-investigation\">44%</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2019/jun/03/gun-violence-bay-area-drop-30-percent-why-investigation\"> between 2007 and 2017</a>, it remains a persistent problem. More than 60 people have been killed by gunshot wounds each year in the city for the past several years. People of color are disproportionately affected. Latino Bay Area residents are 3.5 times more likely to be victims of gun homicides than their white counterparts. Black residents are 22 times more likely.</p> <p>There are also signs that new immigrants in Oakland may be increasingly vulnerable.</p> <p>Ricardo Garcia-Acosta of Youth ALIVE!, an Oakland-based violence intervention organization, found the tally of recent immigrant gun homicide victims have inched up in the past four years, even as total gun homicides in the city have fallen. In 2019, Youth ALIVE! documented 11 such cases in Oakland, up from six in 2016.</p> <p>Many victims were Latin American adult men fatally shot in what appeared to be robberies, Garcia-Acosta said. He noted non-English speaking immigrants may be targeted because they are less likely to notify police and are often unfamiliar with \u201cthe landscape and rules of the uniquely challenging streets of Oakland\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"57f880bef4f3e89ffe72f43a2d02d2ef16ab7db4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57f880bef4f3e89ffe72f43a2d02d2ef16ab7db4/0_0_4500_3599/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anibal Andres Ramirez\u2019s body was found on a bench in East Oakland in this plaza near Foothill Blvd and Seminary Ave on 10 October 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anibal Andres Ramirez\u2019s body was found on a bench in East Oakland in this plaza near Foothill Blvd and Seminary Ave on 10 October 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Hussin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Anibal\u2019s case, older teenage boys seemed to have been after him, his parents said.

It had also forged relationships with local pro bono immigration attorneys to take on students\u2019 immigration cases. And since many older newcomer students must support themselves, the district had opened a new continuation high school, Rudsdale Newcomer high school, with a class schedule designed to make it easier for students to juggle classes and jobs.</p> <p>When Rudsdale first opened its doors, Emma Batten-Bowman, the founding assistant principal, noticed her incoming students often faced danger walking to and from school. \u201cOur newcomers are targeted. They\u2019re jumped. They\u2019re held at gunpoint,\u201d she said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Our newcomers are targeted.

They identified dozens of factors making newcomer students vulnerable to becoming victims or perpetrators of violence, including dangerous local neighborhoods, past trauma, poverty, debts to smugglers and a lack of support systems. It became clear no existing local youth violence prevention program addressed the specific challenges facing newcomers.</p> <p>Ultimately, the school district partnered with a local not-for-profit, Bay Area Community Resources, to hire safety specialists to implement a school district-wide violence prevention program for newcomers.</p> <p>The new initiative launched the following school year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--immersive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F6e467a4eb0a74ba08fa962617d9111fe051436a8%3Fcrop%3D0_0_4500_3600&amp;left-caption=&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F595f6dbc37e582aade6978c5b342582bcf93b7f0%3Fcrop%3D0_0_4500_3600&amp;right-caption=&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\" data-alt=\"Rudsdale Newcomer High school\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F6e467a4eb0a74ba08fa962617d9111fe051436a8%3Fcrop%3D0_0_4500_3600&left-caption=&right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F595f6dbc37e582aade6978c5b342582bcf93b7f0%3Fcrop%3D0_0_4500_3600&right-caption=&always-place-captions-below=false\">Rudsdale Newcomer High school</a> </figure>  <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Starting up the new violence prevention program fell to Ernesto Qui\u00f1onez, the district\u2019s first newcomer safety specialist.</p> <p>Qui\u00f1onez, who was born in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District, was gang-affiliated as a teenager and had been incarcerated for a string of offenses he committed as a juvenile, including assault and battery with a deadly weapon and armed robbery.</p> <p>By August 2018, Qui\u00f1onez had been out of prison three years, and wanted to spend his time helping youth and \u201cundo some of the violence that I\u2019ve done\u201d.</p> <p>He spent the fall of 2018 based out of Rudsdale Newcomer high school, a small campus of portable classrooms clustered around a courtyard.</p> <p>Qui\u00f1onez\u2019s background allowed him to understand the unique pressures her students were facing, Batten-Bowman, the assistant principal, said: \u201cYou need somebody who knows the streets.\u201d</p> <p>Right away, Qui\u00f1onez was busy.</p> <p>A new student who had arrived only months earlier from Guatemala and did not yet understand the seriousness of gang colors, wore red T-shirts to school and was followed home and shot at by another student with a realistic-looking BB gun. A recent graduate was hospitalized after he was shot twice in the stomach. Students were jumped.</p> <p>\u201cThere were so many violent incidents that I was responding to them as fast as I could,\u201d Qui\u00f1onez recalled.</p> <p>Qui\u00f1onez needed to help newcomer students across the school district, so he recruited Jose Garcia to take over as safety specialist for Rudsdale Newcomer.</p> <p>Garcia, a youth educator, activist and artist who had himself immigrated to Oakland as an 11-year-old from Mexico, discovered that adults involved in local criminal organizations were manipulating some newcomer students. The students were coerced into selling drugs or stealing in exchange for housing, he said. Some female students were ensnared by sex trafficking rings.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of these kids are falling into a lot of predatory dynamics just because they have no family,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cThey have no support system, they really have nobody.\u201d</p> <p>The new safety specialists became that support system for the most at-risk newcomers. Qui\u00f1onez and Garcia designed a program to cycle the most vulnerable students into intensive case management \u2013 supporting them as they got out of dangerous situations, assisting them if they had run-ins with the criminal justice system, checking whether they had safe housing, linking them to social services, and eventually, helping students plan for their futures.</p> <p>They created a class where at-risk students practice non-violent conflict resolution techniques, learn about commonalities between their Central American cultures, express themselves through art projects and burn off frustration with physical exercises like boxing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a1646591f4ca5c880952423a36bd8ab359e65228\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1646591f4ca5c880952423a36bd8ab359e65228/0_0_4500_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jose Garcia, the safety specialist coordinator for Oakland unified school district\u2019s newcomer students, outside his Fruitvale home with his dog Rollo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jose Garcia, the safety specialist coordinator for Oakland unified school district\u2019s newcomer students, outside his Fruitvale home with his dog Rollo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Hussin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Garcia named the program \u201cYoung Hawks\u201d because hawks are sacred to many indigenous groups in the Americas. \u201cBut the problem with the hawk\u2019s energy is that if it\u2019s not channeled or is not given a purpose, then it can be destructive,\u201d Garcia said.</p> <p>He noticed many students came to the US fleeing gangs and violence from Central America, but had little knowledge of the historical context that created those conditions.</p> <p>\u201cThey just blame [themselves] automatically for everything wrong with them and their communities,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cThey just feel like that\u2019s how the world works.\u201d</p> <p>Garcia responded by immersing his students in history, teaching about the violence indigenous peoples suffered during Europe\u2019s colonization of the Americas, and the United States\u2019 record of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/19/central-america-migrants-us-foreign-policy\">fueling violent conflicts</a> in Central America. He explains that a <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/03/08/trump-guns-honduras-central-america/\">high portion of guns</a> in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador can be traced back to the United States.</p> <p>\u201cWe dive into those things so that they don\u2019t blame themselves or their parents for the world they inherited,\u201d Garcia said.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>At the beginning of this school year, the Bay Area violence that Ernesto Qui\u00f1onez had been helping to quell struck close to home. His 19-year-old younger brother <a href=\"http://eltecolote.org/content/en/features/a-murdered-son-and-a-fathers-quest-for-truth-justice-and-peace/\">was shot and killed </a>in San Francisco.</p> <p>The tragedy deepened his resolve. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to this work,\u201d Qui\u00f1onez said. \u201cAnd we need to keep doing it.\u201d</p> <p>Qui\u00f1onez has moved on to an oversight role of the Young Hawks program at Bay Area Community Resources and Garcia now supervises two other full-time safety specialists. The three safety specialists manage caseloads for about 120 newcomer students district-wide.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Garcia said his workday began \u201cwhenever that phone rings\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes it starts at 3 in the morning,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might not be on my contract. But that\u2019s what it takes to get the job done correctly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhenever I need him, he is there,\u201d said Michael, a 17-year-old student who asked to only be identified by his first name for safety reasons. In an interview in Spanish, he called Garcia, \u201cA loyal friend.\u201d</p> <p>Michael said he left El Salvador when he was 13 because a cousin insisted he had to either join his gang, or be killed. Other relatives helped smuggle him out of town, and he eventually made it to Oakland.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A lot of these kids are falling into a lot of predatory dynamics just because they have no family</p> <footer> <cite>Jose Garcia</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He described feeling a mix of surprise and disappointment when he discovered gangs were also active in his new neighborhood, and a sense of relief when he realized safety specialists could help him.</p> <p>Michael said last year he and a friend crossed paths with a group of men on Oakland\u2019s Bancroft Avenue who claimed to be gang members and tried to start a fight. Police arrived. At the time, Michael was attending Castlemont high school, and called that school\u2019s newcomer safety specialist, Daniel Silva, for advice.</p> <p>Silva\u2019s response was immediate.</p> <p>\u201cHe arrived to help me,\u201d Michael said. \u201cThe police let me and my friend go.\u201d</p> <p>Michael transferred to Rudsdale Newcomer last fall.

Other Rudsdale Newcomer students echoed the same sentiment.</p> <p>Rudsdale Newcomer had turned a corner.</p> <p>Emma Batten-Bowman, the assistant principal, said there has not been any violence on campus or shootings involving her students so far this school year. She credits the safety specialists and<strong> </strong>Young Hawks.</p> <p>\u201cHaving a support person on campus who really understands what the kids are going through, the kids open up about their actual needs rather than make a bad decision,\u201d Batten-Bowman said.</p> <p>\u201cIt was just such a huge shift,\u201d she added.</p> <p>But just as the Young Hawks program was showing signs of sustained success, the Covid-19 pandemic upended the routines educators had worked hard to build. Oakland unified school district closed school campuses in mid-March, and Garcia and his colleagues now keep up with students individually by phone and social media.</p> <p>Many students are facing financial emergencies after losing jobs at the same time school abruptly shuttered.</p> <p>\u201cKids were using school to get food, encouragement and support,\u201d Batten-Bowman said. \u201cNow they don\u2019t have that outlet.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Oakland police department does not track homicide victims by immigration status or country of origin, but in an interview in early March, Capt Jones of the Ceasefire program said it had been several months since he had heard of a new shooting involving Central American newcomer youth.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing compared to what we typically see with our traditional groups and gangs in the city of Oakland, which we spend most of our time focusing on,\u201d Jones said.</p> <p>He said therapeutic approaches to gang intervention seem to be lowering Oakland\u2019s overall gang population and gun violence. \u201cWe know now we don\u2019t have a huge influx of gang members like we used to. So something\u2019s working.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We don\u2019t have a huge influx of gang members like we used to.

School staff, including Garcia, are assisting students to avoid eviction, pick up food at school sites, get internet access, find new jobs and apply for unemployment benefits if they qualify. They are also pleading with cellphone companies to not shut off students\u2019 phones over unpaid bills.</p> <p>\u201cWe are all social workers now,\u201d Batten-Bowman said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--immersive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F6ad8f4fa366561f028422df94229113d0c6bc59f%3Fcrop%3D0_0_4500_3601&amp;left-caption=&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Ffff333fa08a195d0798b00cc7897b96ad20b2a55%3Fcrop%3D0_0_4500_3600&amp;right-caption=&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\" data-alt=\"fremont school\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F6ad8f4fa366561f028422df94229113d0c6bc59f%3Fcrop%3D0_0_4500_3601&left-caption=&right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Ffff333fa08a195d0798b00cc7897b96ad20b2a55%3Fcrop%3D0_0_4500_3600&right-caption=&always-place-captions-below=false\">fremont school</a> </figure>  <p>Garcia said he is grateful he had the chance to help at-risk students practice healthy habits and create positive support systems before this crisis hit. But he worries about very recent newcomers who have not yet enrolled in school or established a safety net.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just kind of afraid that this [pandemic] is going to roll the boulder down the hill,\u201d Garcia said from his home where he is working remotely. \u201cIt might create a spike in violence or crime just out of sheer survival.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>These days, Gilberto Ramirez, his wife and children are cloistered together at home, sheltering in place.</p> <p>After Anibal\u2019s death, they moved away from their old neighborhood and now live in a rental home closer to the city\u2019s Fruitvale district. They don\u2019t hear nearly as many gunshots any more.</p> <p>A framed photo of Anibal hangs over the family\u2019s couch.

He is growing agitated that nearly two and a half years have passed and police have not arrested anyone.</p> <p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t they do justice in this case?\u201d Ramirez questions. \u201cPolice will arrest you for speeding, but how come if someone is doing violence, harming your family, why not then?\u201d</p> <p>He said he can\u2019t help wondering if justice for a poor Latino boy is not a police priority.</p> <p>The Oakland police department\u2019s Sgt Brad Baker said the homicide was \u201cstill an open, active investigation\u201d, and that, \u201cwe treat all these cases equally across the board\u201d.</p> <p>Anibal\u2019s mother, Florinda, described him in her limited Spanish as \u201ca good son\u201d who always offered to help her by running errands for her at the store.</p> <p>In the period after his death, Ramirez said his wife wept constantly and was too distraught to leave the house.</p> <p>Late last year, they welcomed a new baby girl.</p> <p>Ramirez has started to wonder if he should think about moving his family of six out of Oakland for safety reasons.</p> <p>\u201cThere are a lot of criminals and murderers here,\u201d Ramirez said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t fight with their hands \u2013 they fight with guns.\u201d</p> <p>Still, he<strong> </strong>is<strong> </strong>grateful to Oakland for one kindness. A city official raised money for Anibal\u2019s funeral expenses.</p> <p>The donations helped Ramirez send Anibal\u2019s body back to Guatemala, where the boy is buried in his home town.</p>",

allowed to count oil reserves held in the United States towards its stockpiling commitments, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has confirmed.<br></p> \n  <p>Last week the energy minister, <strong>Angus Taylor,</strong> announced the government would take advantage of historically low fuel prices and spend $94m to start building a national oil reserve - but <a

in the US at first</a>.</p> \n  <p>Under IEA rules, Australia and other member countries have an obligation to hold emergency oil stocks equivalent to at least 90 days of net oil imports as part of planning to avoid a hit from any major disruption to oil supplies.</p> \n  <p>But Australia\u2019s stocks were equivalent to just 55 days as of December.<br></p> \n  <p>We contacted the IEA to check whether the oil to be held in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the US would count towards Australia\u2019s IEA 90-day stockpiling commitment.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cThe answer is simply: yes, we can confirm,\u201d the IEA\u2019s press office replied.</p> \n  <p><strong>Fatih Birol</strong>, the IEA director, welcomed the announcement, saying it would not only boost Australia\u2019s oil security but support efforts to stabilise global oil markets.</p> \n  <p>The IEA allows member countries to store emergency stocks abroad as long <a

Out in the real world, our tentacles entwine nature\u2019s fabric,\u201d Schilthuizen writes. \u201cWhile we have been trying to save the world\u2019s crumbling pre-urban ecosystems, we have been ignoring the fact that nature has already been putting up the scaffolds to build novel, urban ecosystems for the future.\u201d</p> \n<p>Haunting images of wolves, bison and bears living in deserted towns following the 1986 Chernobyl disaster indicate what happens when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/may/28/chernobyl-wildlife-haven-tour-belarus-created-nuclear-disaster-zone\">humans leave a place for good</a>. The coronavirus lockdown shows how quickly wildlife closes in. \u201cIt is interesting to consider how fragile our urban environment is. If we\u2019re not constantly present, it\u2019s being taken over by nature very quickly,\u201d says Schilthuizen, who is professor of evolutionary biology at Leiden University in the Netherlands.</p> \n<p>The unique thing about coronavirus is that it is causing multiple cities across the globe to simultaneously go into hibernation. This gives ecologists an insight into how humans change urban biodiversity in multiple locations. \u201cAnimals are nearby, constantly watching us from the outskirts and the forests, and as soon as our presence seems to be abating they start exploring where new terrain could be won \u2026 It makes you aware of how we\u2019re constantly competing with many species,\u201d says Schilthuizen.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2b96c8d02517de2e87a29e86329d469e04963180\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b96c8d02517de2e87a29e86329d469e04963180/0_0_3113_2075/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two silvery-brown Tamarin or Grey Titi monkeys (saguinus leucopus) in Medellin, Colombia, 16 April 2020.

In the past few decades this has started to change but we still know little about the urban wildlife we live alongside, says Rana El-Sabaawi, associate professor of biology at Canada\u2019s University of Victoria.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf you look in the literature, the field of urban ecology doesn\u2019t really come into its own until the last decade or two. Before that there were a smattering of papers and reports, mostly descriptions of biodiversity trends in and around specific cities. In recent years there has been a growing appreciation of the ecological mechanisms that explain biodiversity in the city,\u201d she says.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f0af93063473d6b1f55a45621add1885f89b4de5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0af93063473d6b1f55a45621add1885f89b4de5/0_0_2050_1366/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A puma in the streets of Santiago, 24 March 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A puma in the streets of Santiago, 24 March 2020.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andres Pina/ATON CHILE/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Urban environments are messy places (full of lights, pollution and people pursuing their own interests), which makes studying them difficult. It\u2019s all very well to observe animals and plants in urban places, but understanding how these different processes fit together is more problematic.</p> \n<p>At the same time, there is increasing recognition that few places on Earth are free from human influence \u2013 there is a plastic bag at the bottom of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/20/plastic-pollution-mariana-trench-deepest-point-ocean\">Mariana </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/20/plastic-pollution-mariana-trench-deepest-point-ocean\"> Trench</a>, and Antarctica\u2019s remote glaciers are flecked with microplastics. Understanding places where humans interact with nature most should help planners and developers create cities that hold as much wildlife as possible.</p> \n<h2><strong>Opportunists do well in cities</strong></h2> \n<p>Broadly speaking, \u201csensitive\u201d species, whose habitat is destroyed by urban developments, are unlikely to venture into urban areas. \u201cOpportunists\u201d, which have a much broader diet and high tolerance for noise and pollution, are more at home. Coronavirus means species that might lie in the grey area between these categories are now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/animals-cities-coronavirus-lockdowns-deer-raccoons\">more likely to venture</a> into previously unexplored urban areas.</p> \n<p>Racoons, pigeons, foxes, gulls and crows are opportunists and considered a nuisance by many humans who live alongside them. Animals such as these, which scavenge human rubbish to get food, are likely to be struggling during lockdown.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c2060df50a3ead559c630f2ac1a357c102cae55\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c2060df50a3ead559c630f2ac1a357c102cae55/0_0_4122_2483/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A racoon walks over the running path in almost deserted Central Park in Manhattan, 16 April 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"602\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A racoon walks over the running path in almost deserted Central Park in Manhattan, 16 April 2020.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johannes Eisele/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/06/the-great-green-expansion-how-ring-necked-parakeets-took-over-london\">Ring-necked parakeets</a> might disperse away from urban parks and forage on agricultural land instead. Residents of the East Riding in Yorkshire have been warned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/02/beware-hungry-seagulls-during-lockdown-yorkshire-residents-told\">seagulls could be more aggressive</a> because there are fewer seaside day-trippers feeding them leftover chips. In Amsterdam, even coots \u2013 which sometimes line their nests with plastic \u2013 may have a tough time finding replacement materials.</p> \n<p>\u201cOften what happens when food supply runs short is increased competition and aggression between animals,\u201d says El-Sabaawi. \u201cThere have already been fascinating reports from Asia about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/13/hungry-monkeys-brawl-over-food-as-coronavirus-hits-tourism-in-thailand-video\">monkey \u2018brawls\u2019</a> caused by food shortages. If the food shortages are really severe and extended, then populations might decline.\u201d</p> \n<p>Other animals seem to be doing well with fewer people on the street. Urban songbirds, for example, can communicate more easily when the din of background traffic is reduced. Deer, badgers and wild boar might be emboldened to start pinching food from suburban gardens or roadsides. A herd of goats has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/mar/31/llandudno-goats-herd-running-riot-coronavirus-lockdown\">running riot</a> through the Welsh town of Llandudno, munching on people\u2019s gardens as they go.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a6423f076c8c12a8e315846fd725bd7ee569b311\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6423f076c8c12a8e315846fd725bd7ee569b311/0_250_3500_2034/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A herd of goats in Llandudno, Wales 31 March 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"581\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A herd of goats in Llandudno, Wales on 31 March.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Most researchers are agreed these species\u2019 corona-related behavioural changes are temporary and the luxury of living in town will stop when humans re-emerge. Lockdown will probably have a similar effect on wildlife populations as an exceptionally wet or hot year \u2013 provided things return to how they were.</p> \n<p>In terms of wildlife sightings during this period, it\u2019s hard to separate fact, fiction and wishful thinking \u2013 it\u2019s a complex picture and new research is starting to try to make sense of what is happening. Scientists have launched a <a href=\"https://renoir.hypotheses.org/files/2020/03/Silent%C2%B7Cities-Project.pdf\">Silent Cities</a><a href=\"https://renoir.hypotheses.org/files/2020/03/Silent%C2%B7Cities-Project.pdf\"> project</a> to look at the diversity of sounds in places normally masked by anthropogenic noise. People are being encouraged to record sounds in \u201cordinary\u201d suburban/urban spaces such as in a backyard or on a balcony during lockdown, and compare it to noises when things are back to normal.</p> \n<p>Cities are also powerhouses for permanent changes. For example, there are distinct subspecies of mosquitoes found on the London underground that no longer hibernate and feed on human blood as opposed to bird blood, according to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/6884120\">research published in Nature in 1999</a>. Even more remarkable, mosquitoes living on different tube lines do not mix so the population living on the Circle line is genetically different to those living on the Piccadilly line. This change happened over 100 generations or so \u2013 significantly faster than Charles Darwin thought possible.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42b1660ee5da06dfc64b22217cd44e0e72ecbbd5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42b1660ee5da06dfc64b22217cd44e0e72ecbbd5/0_0_7108_4744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A hungry seagull tries to open up a garbage bag at via Fori Imperiali, Rome, Italy, 9 April 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A hungry seagull tries to open up a garbage bag at via Fori Imperiali, Rome, Italy, 9 April 2020.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefano Montesi - Corbis/Corbis via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Urban blackbirds are also morphing into a new species, according to Schilthuizen. Across European and north African cities, blackbirds living in urban areas have developed shorter bills (probably thanks to an abundance of bird feeders and easier pickings in cities). Traffic noise has caused urban blackbirds to sing in the night when it\u2019s quieter, and they also breed around a month earlier than their countryside cousins.</p> \n<p>Scientists think the urban blackbird, <em>Turdus urbanicus,</em> could be the first of many species to adapt to life in the city. Schilthuizen writes: \u201cThe pace of evolution is set by ecological opportunities that emerge from human interactions \u2026 In those pressure cookers of environmental change, species will need to speed up their evolution or become extinct.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Plants tell the history of our cities</strong></h2> \n<p>Changes in botany have been massive in the past decade with huge shifts in wild plants living in urban areas, according to London-based botanist Dr Mark Spencer. \u201cPlants have lived with us in our cities for thousands of years and they move along with us and they tell stories about us,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>London is an important focal point for the arrival of non-native species in the UK, either arriving accidentally by international trade (via wool, for example) or escapees from domestic horticulture. Cities are the first pitstop for species that could later spread around the whole country.</p> \n<p>For example, loquat (a common cousin of plums, cherries and apricots) is becoming established in London where Greek and Turkish communities typically live because people spit out the pips on the ground after they\u2019ve eaten the fruit. And now it\u2019s starting to sprout in the wild.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bf852f44d112806c2edb218e01e01db694369c56\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf852f44d112806c2edb218e01e01db694369c56/0_0_4380_2920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Himalayan balsam (impatiens glandulifera) flourishes in Devon, UK.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Himalayan balsam<em> (impatiens glandulifera)</em> flourishes in Devon, UK.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Papilio/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Widespread non-native plants such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/05/country-diary-the-explosive-impatience-of-himalayan-balsam\">Himalayan balsam</a>, buddleia and Japanese knotweed were originally imported for horticulture. \u201cThe detailed research on the entry points of these well-established non-native species is not done,\u201d says Spencer. \u201cIn this country, we have a focus on doing biological and ecological research on nice pristine chalk grasslands \u2013 which are wonderful habitats. We don\u2019t like getting down and dirty with weird and wonderful street pavements. That\u2019s pretty much it, putting it in crass terms. Urban areas are very poorly understood.\u201d</p> \n<p>Like animals, plants also adapt to city life. <em>Crepis </em><em>sancta</em>, a widely spread Mediterranean member of the daisy family, has moved into Montpellier in France. In 12 years the <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/105/10/3796\">seeds have evolved</a> to be larger and heavier so they are more likely to fall into soil near their parent plant rather than on concrete which covers most of the city. Lighter seeds were 55% less likely to germinate, researchers found.</p> \n<p>\u201cOrdinary\u201d urban areas are places we desperately need to understand, Spencer says. \u201cA lot of this stuff is not about traipsing around recording hyper-rarities or incredible orchids, it\u2019s about getting the common and the widespread.\u201d</p> \n<p>People sending in samples of species can help researchers collect more accurate records about changes in botany. \u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve been trying to do for the past decade or so in natural history is get past this idea that it\u2019s elite, purely expert, frankly old, white, male, grey tops that can do it, and no one else can. Actually, the only way you get past this is by supporting people,\u201d says Spencer, who encourages people to submit plant sightings to <a href=\"https://www.brc.ac.uk/irecord/\">i-record</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e62083af1f8e8dbe24dea7e680882b4f19c28ec7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e62083af1f8e8dbe24dea7e680882b4f19c28ec7/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ducks in the fountains almost outnumber people on London\u2019s Trafalgar Square, 15 Apr 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ducks in the fountains almost outnumber people in London\u2019s Trafalgar Square on 15 April.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emerson Utracik/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Will lockdown change how people interact with nature? Probably not, says Schilthuizen. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying the quiet. I keep thinking to myself, this is the way things should be, without constant air traffic overhead and without constant noise of traffic and throngs of people spending money on the streets \u2026 But I think we have a short memory.

As human time and geological time collapse into one another, the deep past is erupting into the present all around us with terrifying and uncanny consequences. What was fixed is now in flux, what was settled is being swept away faster than we can save it. Nor is it just the past that has become unstable.

How are we to live in such a world?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For many people this process became suddenly tangible last summer when fires devastated south-eastern Australia.

In the months since, those images have been superseded by the spreading catastrophe of coronavirus, a moment of discontinuity that has only reinforced the vulnerability of our society, the speed with which natural forces can overwhelm the structures that sustain and shape our world.</p> <p>Part of the job of any art is what the cultural theorist Donna Haraway calls staying with the trouble. Art exists to record how it feels to be alive here, now, to capture the confusing, conflicting, sometimes terrifying, sometimes joyous messiness of the moment. It exists to bear witness. But art also needs to do more than just capture the here and now. We need it to help us see beyond the immediate, to understand how our stories connect to those of other people, in other times, to help us recognise we are part of a larger story.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e28ed1b8027eef572344d0109b6c09880c5a74f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e28ed1b8027eef572344d0109b6c09880c5a74f/0_0_3000_1925/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An old chair sticks out of the mud on the shore line of Lake Eucumbene at Old Adaminaby, a town that was flooded as part of the Snowy Mountains Hydro Electric scheme in 1956.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"642\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An old chair sticks out of the mud on the shore line of Lake Eucumbene at Old Adaminaby in 2007, a town that was flooded as part of the Snowy Mountains hydroelectric scheme in 1956.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Nolan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A desire to give shape to some of these connections drove my 2015 novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/14/clade-by-james-bradley-review\">Clade</a>, which traced the experiences of three generations of a family as their world was transformed by climate catastrophe. When I was writing Clade it still seemed possible we might avoid the worst effects of global heating. But in the years since finishing it that hope has become harder and harder to sustain. Every day brings new stories of loss and extinction, every day our world seems to grow more violent, more deranged. Every day the spectre of collapse seems closer at hand.</p> <p>Faced with this reality I began to ask a series of slightly different questions, questions about inevitability and the new reality we inhabit. At what point, I wondered, does what we are losing become unbearable? At what point does hope become just another form of denial? How are we to live in such a world?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Environmental crisis and climate catastrophe collapse distance and time, bringing the deep past rushing into the present</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My new novel, Ghost Species, seeks to explore these questions by asking what it would mean if the deep past were to come to life in a literal sense, through a scheme to recreate a Neanderthal child from remnant DNA. Although this idea might seem pure science fiction, it isn\u2019t, or isn\u2019t quite. Many scientists believe cloning may offer a way to de-extinct species wiped out by human activity. Here in Australia researchers have already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/dec/11/thylacine-dna-reveals-weakness-kangaroo-tasmanian-tiger-genome\">laid many of the building blocks to resurrect the thylacine</a>, while in Russia scientists in Siberia are working on a scheme to hold back the collapse of the permafrost by<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/04/pleistocene-park/517779/\"> recreating the ecology that existed in the region 12,000 years ago</a>, complete with woolly mammoths.</p> <p>It seemed to me this technology and its possibilities offered a way of thinking through not just the idea that the world might have become unhinged, that time might be out of joint, but also the processes of grief and mourning so many of us are grappling with. What is it we are losing when a species or an ecosystem vanishes from the world? What it is we think we are bringing back if we recreate them? What would it be like to <em>be</em> such a being?</p> <p>As the story and characters took shape, I found myself asking other questions. Questions about the super-rich and their planning for the end of the world. Questions about love and loss and the bond between the child and her adoptive mother. Questions about the boundary between human and the non-human.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/26/job-losses-cancelled-tours-delayed-releases-the-australian-books-industry-grapples-with-huge-shock\">Job losses, cancelled tours, delayed releases: the Australian books industry grapples with 'huge shock'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Along the way I began to write differently as well. Environmental crisis and climate catastrophe collapse distance and time, bringing the deep past rushing into the present and the distant to our doorstep. Approaching them in fiction brought the boundary between fiction and real life crashing down as well, until finally it seemed I was processing my own fears and feelings directly into fiction, resulting in a book that was often frighteningly personal.</p> <p>Yet most of all, I found myself having to confront a series of questions about the fragility of the structures that shape our world, the onrushing cost of climate catastrophe, and how we are to live in a world in which our most basic assumptions are collapsing.</p> <p>I began writing Ghost Species just after <a href=\"https://sydneyreviewofbooks.com/essay/an-ocean-and-an-instant/\">my father\u2019s death</a>.

It was edited while bushfires raged up and down Australia\u2019s east coast, in a city thick with smoke and grief, and will be published in a world paralysed by a pandemic. Perhaps unsurprisingly therefore, it is a book that is, in many ways, defined and suffused by the sense of loss so many of us feel at the moment. But it is also a book that seeks to remind us that even out of the most seismic loss and grief, new configurations are always possible.</p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.penguin.com.au/books/ghost-species-9781926428666\">Ghost Species by James Bradley is out on 28 April 2020 through Hamish Hamilton</a></em></p>",

So my food budget means I have to ration myself to eating every second day. Sometimes I\u2019ll go as long as four or five days without eating. I\u2019m very, very much looking forward to the supplement because it means for the first time in a long time I\u2019ll be able to buy fresh vegies, fresh fruit.</p> <p>It also means so much more. I haven\u2019t bought my daughter a birthday present since 2012. She\u2019ll be 33 in June. I\u2019ll be 59. I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll buy her some art supplies \u2013 she\u2019s very artistic. She only uses the cheap stuff to experiment, but when she makes something she wants to sell, she uses the expensive stuff. As for me, there are all sorts of things I used to do that I\u2019ve forgotten because I can\u2019t afford to do them. I used to knit and crochet, but wool is expensive if you want to make anything like a jumper. I even used to dragon boat race. It\u2019s the only sport I\u2019ve loved and used to train three times a week when I had a job. I even competed nationally. Got medals and everything. But the membership costs money I didn\u2019t have, so I stopped.</p> <h2><strong>Avery Howard, 18, Sydney</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019ve been on the full independent youth allowance payment since I was 16 and became homeless. At the moment, the payment is $100 less than jobseeker, which is based on a highly outdated notion that young people are supported by their family.</p> <p>When the initial $750 stimulus pay came through, I used it to pay off some bills and buy some groceries. It was hard to find some things because of all the panic buying, but I was able to buy fresh food like mince and put that in the freezer, which I haven\u2019t been able to do until recently. Beforehand, skipping meals was definitely something I had to do. I still do it, but it\u2019s less of a necessity. I\u2019ve just gotten used to not eating as much.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6fa08dbeae36d3ccf9fd7188e00f6a987afe74ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fa08dbeae36d3ccf9fd7188e00f6a987afe74ab/0_41_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Avery, 18, Sydney\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Avery, 18, Sydney: \u2018It means I can breathe easier.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The $550 fortnightly supplement basically means I can breathe easier. It means I won\u2019t be so stressed about managing every cent like I\u2019m used to. I can use it to pay off an Afterpay bill from when I replaced my jeans and shirts that had been worn past repair. Longer term, I\u2019d like to save for a better computer as my current laptop was given to me by my school years ago, and has been put through the wringer. In the very long term, I\u2019d like to save some money to visit my partner who lives in the US. That\u2019s quite expensive, so I\u2019ll hope to squirrel away some money to get me there someday.</p> <h2><strong>Jessica Harrison, 65, Wonthaggi</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019ve worked part time and lived on what used to be called Newstart for around ten years. I live in a small town where there\u2019s limited chance for any kind of full-time occupation, any type of full-time paid work and because I\u2019m 65 it\u2019s hard to find a job at that age. I\u2019m lucky though, Wonthaggi is a beautiful place and I have lots of friends who help take care of each other. It\u2019s still tough at times. You get that sort of knot in the stomach when you think you\u2019ve spent too much on food that week. I suppose that big change with that temporary increase is what will lessen that feeling.</p> <p>The moment I heard about the supplement payment, I immediately started to mentally budget on what I could spend it on. It was instant. The first thing I am going to buy is some cream cheese, some crusty bread and one of those packets of smoked salmon. That\u2019s the luxury food that you don\u2019t buy at all when you\u2019re on that tiny amount. After that are the big things like house repairs and saving for dental work. The stuff on the house you just put off for a long time. There is a leak at the back of my toilet which I\u2019m going to be getting fixed. And my chimney is pretty rusted. Get my car serviced. These are things you put off as a long as you can because no matter what you calculate one repair will lead to another. Same with teeth, really.</p> <h2><strong>Cameron Ezzy, 25, Townsville</strong></h2> <p>Right now I\u2019m working at Dominos to support myself while I do a social work degree. I usually get $300 to $400 a week from Dominos, with Centrelink topping up my wage. Before the $750 stimulus, I was overcharging my bank account by $50. Usually we were just getting by, month-to-month.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"11b48dce225af8aa8cd90ed593bd73feef75c220\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11b48dce225af8aa8cd90ed593bd73feef75c220/250_0_489_546/448.jpg\" alt=\"Cameron, 25, Townsville\" width=\"448\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cameron, 25, Townsville.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve got $300 in savings \u2013 not much for an emergency. It was tough even getting basics like veggies and fuel. I help my partner out as well. She struggles with her mental health and studies. I work so she can take care of herself.</p> <p>The payment was announced pretty much on my birthday, so it was happy birthday from the Australian government. The money\u2019ll basically mean we\u2019re buying time. One day me and my partner would like to get married, have kids. We\u2019re thinking about moving to Melbourne one day, but we have to sort out work first, finish the degrees. Right now though we\u2019re just trying to survive, so the money means we\u2019ll be able to do that. I\u2019ll be able to cover car registration. I\u2019ll be stocking up on food a little bit \u2013 we go to the Asian grocer because no one tends to buy from there because they\u2019re worried about getting the coronavirus from Asian people. Which is stupid. Migraine medication is not on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme so that\u2019s $50 every time, which will be easier to get now. What it means is time to study. Less time to work. Time to prepare to make a big change.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/26/i-havent-left-my-building-life-gets-harder-for-vulnerable-australians-during-coronavirus-crisis\">'I haven't left my building': life gets harder for vulnerable Australians during coronavirus crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Julie Wilson*, 54, Shoalhaven</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019ve variously been on what was called Newstart and the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme for nearly two years \u2013 I run an Airbnb, which gives me opportunities others don\u2019t have, though with the recent fires and now the pandemic, we\u2019re not getting any visitors.</p> <p>When I heard they were giving additional money, I was cynical. I was under the impression this money was only going to people who were laid off because of the virus. Change might be happening, but it\u2019s government isn\u2019t it? I did not trust that there would not be some loophole. I\u2019m still not sure if I qualify. I haven\u2019t heard from anyone directly, though I\u2019m not thinking about it. I\u2019m in survival mode.</p> <p>It would be great if it happens. It means I can pay my friend back the thousand dollars I borrowed when I needed it. Then there\u2019s the house \u2013 there\u2019s always something that needs repairing. I can plan and organise for my small business food van to get up and running again. It\u2019ll mean I can buy bulk ingredients and because of the pandemic and social distancing rules I will need to rethink how to operate. I plan to take orders and deliver orders directly to homes.</p> <p>My life could change, but realistically, I won\u2019t believe it until I see it. I try not to get my hopes up, because I can\u2019t risk feeling hopelessness.</p> <h2><strong>Imogen Bunting, 47, Brisbane</strong></h2> <p>I walked to work at my part-time job this morning. A middle-aged man on a bike yelled at me because I didn\u2019t have cigarettes for him. The cops were surprised when I told them I\u2019m homeless too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e1ca51534fdddd44eee77b11b7b5188448b2bce3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1ca51534fdddd44eee77b11b7b5188448b2bce3/0_0_960_1280/750.jpg\" alt=\"Imogen, 47, Brisbane, with her cat\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Imogen, 47, Brisbane, with her cat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m so close to living in my car again. I\u2019ve got a bed this week in a $50 apartment. It\u2019s just a bed and bath with no other facilities \u2013 not even garbage collection. No cooking or laundry. At least I can lock my door and not worry about creeps staring in my car window.</p> <p>The extra $550 a fortnight is a great relief, but it was luck the government decided to do this. I\u2019ve been kicked off the public housing list so maybe I\u2019ll use that money to get a pair of glasses so I can see and write my re-application and housing appeal? It\u2019s not enough to pay my car rego. Definitely a good pair of shoes ... some new clothes. A bit of dignity. Is that a luxury? I\u2019ll eat a little better, if I can have a fridge to store food in. My overall health will improve with the certainty of a good night\u2019s sleep. Without a home I can\u2019t get my cat back.</p> <p>When Covid-19 clears up, I\u2019ll get back to studying my law and criminology degree. Maybe the money will help. Though it\u2019s terrifying there is an end date \u2013 afterwards people are going to be shunted back to abject poverty. Me? Next week, it looks like I\u2019ll be couch surfing in Brisbane again, where my tribe is.</p> <h2><strong>Mandy Weber, 48, Bacchus Marsh</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019m a single mum with two kids and usually a full-time chef. The transition from the parenting payment to Newstart, back when my eldest was eight, was rough. We spent three months living in a car. Now I use it to top up my income, but I lost my job in the pandemic. I don\u2019t think that pub will open again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3963d232fe0e039dc8d0891024780419157cc4b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3963d232fe0e039dc8d0891024780419157cc4b9/0_0_3017_1810/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mandy, 48, from Bacchus Marsh, Victoria, with her two daughters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mandy, 48, from Bacchus Marsh, Victoria, with her two daughters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Until they announced they were going to do the coronavirus supplement, I was honestly terrified. I didn\u2019t know what we were going to do for money. I was selling things to keep us going. Until it comes I\u2019ve only got $48 to survive on, and that\u2019s to feed my two girls. I did my grocery shopping this week on $19. Right now my bank balance is 42 cents. When the money does come through, I\u2019ll be replacing some of the stuff I sold.</p> <p>The main thing is to keep paying for my girls\u2019 education. I want them to have a better life than I had so I want to buy them a future. VET courses are $900 a year, combined. Then there\u2019s school books. E-books. Pens and pencils. School bags for when they go back. Uniforms. Their laptops were $1,000 each. Then there\u2019s the internet, which I have to have now at $90 a month. A printer.</p> <p>That supplement is going to make a huge difference to my household, being able to pay the rent, buy food. It\u2019s hope, but then there\u2019ll also be despair at the end. A bit of grief and loss. Because all of a sudden, in October, we\u2019ll go back to nothing again.</p> <p><em>As told to Royce Kurmelovs. The interviews have been edited for length and clarity</em></p> <p><em>*Name has been changed</em><br></p>"
