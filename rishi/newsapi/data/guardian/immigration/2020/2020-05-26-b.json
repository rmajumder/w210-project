  "<p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09l64y9\">A House Through Time</a> (BBC2) has always been an oasis of calm. Partly because of presenter David Olusoga\u2019s permanent air of absolute tranquillity (some people may find it bordering on soporific \u2013 I feel more as though he\u2019s enabling me to let the edges of the scene blur and melt) and partly because its subject \u2013 unlike the messy humanity of Who Do You Think You Are? \u2013 is essentially neutral. The house whose history is under discussion is blessedly silent. It is the place to which we all return after the story of each of its owners or tenants is told, to gather our thoughts, digest what we have learned and mull the wider implications before setting out again down a new avenue.</p> <p>For series three, the focus is on an older house than usual. Number 10 Guinea Street in Redcliffe, Bristol \u2013 Olusoga\u2019s home town since the 1990s \u2013 is a gracious three-storey (plus attic, plus basement), ornately plastered, beautifully panelled and flagstoned pile built, along with several others, by a Captain Edmund Saunders in 1718. And, like most gracious three-storey piles built by sea captains in Bristol in the 18th century, it was funded by fortunes made from slave trading.</p> <p>Saunders was one of the most prolific buyers and sellers of people at the time. Olusoga (and his researchers) linked him to over 40 voyages ferrying 12,000 souls from their homes in Africa to their indentured lives in the Americas. He never lived in the house but rented it to its first occupant \u2013 another slave trader, Captain Joseph Smith. According to newspaper reports in 1721, Smith\u2019s ship was captured twice by pirates (the same ones) and he and his crew were cast adrift in a rowboat after it was looted and set on fire. Somehow \u2013 the records do not show how \u2013 he made it the 5,000 miles home. A few years later he bumped into one of the pirates, Bridstock Weaver, who appears to have been a \u201cforced man\u201d \u2013 ie himself enslaved by the real pirates and probably known to be such by Smith. Nevertheless, after a failed attempt to extort \u201crestitution\u201d from Weaver, Smith had him arrested and Weaver was sentenced to hang. The record of a pardon instead of execution shows that at least one tiny measure of the suffering inflicted by Smith during his life was averted.</p> <p>A foundling baby left on his doorstep (Smith and his wife refused to take her in and she died at the age of three in the presumably negligible care of the parish) took us down the highways and byways of poor laws and options (or lack thereof) for the vulnerable in a time long before the welfare state. </p> <p>The next owner, John Shebbeare was a Tory political satirist and everything that implies \u2013 the kind of pain in the arse whose type can be recognised down the ages. One of his hobbyhorses was the \u201cnational ruin\u201d brought about by the Hanoverian kings, another was the uselessness of women in general (\u201cThe best I ever knew is not worth the worst man\u201d) and his wife in particular (\u201cI think I have been yoked for about one and 40 years and have wished my wife underground anytime since\u201d). He died in 1788 \u2013 about 10 years after his wife, alas, who must have got no peace in this life, but at least before he could set up a Twitter account.</p> <p>After him came the Holbrooks, who made their fortune from slave-run sugar plantations and kept a black servant, Thomas. A notice offering \u201ca handsome reward\u201d for Thomas\u2019s return, after he apparently fled 10 Guinea Street in 1759, is the only surviving record of his life. Whether he was caught and returned, caught and sent back to Africa as a slave as punishment, or made it to a ship that offered the comparative freedom of life on the high seas we will never know.</p> <p>Like Who Do You Think You Are? \u2013 and the likes of the wonderful The Secret History of Our Streets a few years ago \u2013 A House Through Time does what it does very well. It is history humanised and made accessible and though it does not go into much detail, that is different from being oversimplified. There is room to breathe. What it covers, it doesn\u2019t rush through. And Olusoga always clears a little imaginative space for the lives \u2013 such as that of Thomas here, and for those of servants and women in other episodes \u2013 that go undocumented, paying tribute to the unsung labour and silent sufferings of those who never make it into the records but upon whose backs so much of what endures around us was built.</p>",

Ross said the way that Cummings had interpreted the lockdown rules was at odds with the vast majority of the public who followed them. The prime minister\u2019s key aide was defended this morning by the Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove and at the daily press briefing by the health secretary Matt Hancock, who maintained his explanation had shown that he acted within the guidelines. A growing number of Tory MPs, however, disagree and have revolted against the government, calling for Cummings to either resign or be sacked.</li> \n   <li><strong>Westminster Opposition parties, bar Labour, penned a joint letter to the prime minister calling for Cummings to go</strong><em><strong>.</strong> </em>The leaders said in the letter, which was also sent to Patrick Vallance who chairs Sage, that the issue transcended politics and Cumming\u2019s behaviour is \u201ca matter of public health\u201d. The letter urged Boris Johnson to restore trust and clarity to public health messaging by sacking his key adviser. </li> \n   <li><strong>Matt Hancock said the government would review the fines imposed on families travelling during lockdown for childcare purposes.</strong> The pledge was made following a question from a member of the public at the daily press conference, which put Hancock on the spot. The government then <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbclaurak/status/1265328468067311616\">said Hancock had not announced a review</a>, but that he had said he would pass on the concerns to colleagues. </li> \n   <li><strong>Matt Hancock described a new trial of the Remdesivir drug as \u201cthe biggest step forward\u201d in treatment since the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis.</strong> The anti-viral drug was used during the Ebola outbreak, and the health secretary said early data suggests it can shorten recovery time from Covid-19 by four days.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UK\u2019s death toll passed 37,000, rising by 134 to 37,048.</strong> The ONS figure, however, which includes all deaths where Covid-19 is mentioned on the death certificate \u2013 so, both confirmed or suspected cases \u2013 is <strong>42,173</strong> deaths involving coronavirus in England and Wales were recorded to 15 May (registered up to 23 May).

leader Ruth Davidson\u2019s talent for distancing her group from Westminster clusterbourachs.</p> \n  <p>It\u2019s worth remembering that these politicians face re-election next May, and are looking at Ipsos Mori polling for the BBC this morning that found 82% of Scots think <strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong> has handled the coronavirus crisis well, in contrast to 30% saying the same thing about Boris Johnson.</p> \n  <p>Plus, Ross, who unseated the SNP\u2019s then Westminster leader, Angus Robertson, in Moray in 2017, has a majority of little over 500, which can only sharpen his response to the outrage of constituents that he detailed in his resignation statement. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-26T10:44:55.300Z\">at 11.44am

He drove to Barnard Castle, the family stopped, he walked a few yards, sat on a bench for a short period of time, then walked back to the car and then drove back to his home.

  "<p><strong>Denmark</strong> has made it easier for cross-border couples separated from their partners by lockdown to meet again, while <strong>Germany</strong> is expected to allow travel to 31 European countries from mid-June, as EU countries continued to lift coronavirus restrictions.</p> \n<p>People living in <strong>Norway</strong>, <strong>Sweden, Finland</strong> and Germany can now visit partners in Denmark by signing a simple declaration rather than having to provide photos, phone records and other proof of a relationship, the Danish justice minister, Nick H\u00e6kkerup, said.</p> \n<p>A government source in Berlin, meanwhile, told Reuters <strong>Germany</strong> was planning to lift a travel warning for its 26 fellow EU countries plus Britain, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein from 15 June providing infection rates remain under control.</p> \n<p>Under the proposal, the general travel warning that has been in place since 17 March would be replaced by individual advice tailored to the spread of the pandemic in each country, potentially allowing Germans to holiday abroad this summer.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"77142d5a-0bf3-4a80-b538-c47a11b57f6a\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>People over 60 or with health issues should wear a medical-grade mask when they are out and cannot socially distance, according to new guidance from the World Health Organization, while all others should wear a three-layer fabric mask.</p>\n    <p>The WHO guidance, announced on 5 June, is a result of research commissioned by the organisation.

He explained some 1,000 businesses had made unintentional reporting errors in their enrolments for the jobkeeper program. A large number with just one employee apparently put 1,500 in the box asking for how many employees they expected to claim for. This was the dollar amount they intended to claim, not the number of employees.</p> \n<p>But that doesn\u2019t really explain how an error of this scale went unnoticed or why Treasury\u2019s original forecast of $130bn made on March 30 was so far out of the ballpark.</p> \n<p>\u201cNo money that shouldn\u2019t have been paid has been paid,\u201d the treasurer said. Instead, it was the estimates that were wrong and the errors were picked up when employers made their actual claims and provided names and tax file numbers of employees, he said.</p> \n<p>The hugely embarrassing mistake shows the danger of policy on the run. But it also provides an opportunity to fine tune the jobkeeper scheme, the centrepiece of the government\u2019s labour support program, and work towards an exit strategy for the expensive program.</p> \n<p>When the news broke on Friday, Frydenberg appeared to rule out extending jobkeeper to other groups. \u201cThis revision is not an invitation to spend more money. All of the money that the government is spending during the coronavirus period is borrowed money,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>On Monday the treasurer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/25/frydenberg-rules-out-wholesale-changes-to-jobkeeper-despite-60bn-underspend#maincontent\">confirmed no \u201cwholesale changes\u201d to the scheme were in the government\u2019s thinking</a>, while leaving the door open to amendments in some sectors, such as tourism. </p> \n<p>But there are clearly some inequities that need to be addressed as well as a compelling economic need to plan what happens when jobkeeper abruptly finishes in September.</p> \n<p>First, a little about what jobkeeper is and isn\u2019t.</p> \n<p>Although it\u2019s billed as a wage replacement or wage supplement, it\u2019s actually paid to businesses that have seen a fall in their turnover of 30%, or 50% if their turnover is more than $1bn.</p> \n<p>Businesses receive $1,500 for each eligible employee, which they must pass on in full to the employee. But eligibility is related to business turnover, which makes the payment more like a business subsidy.</p> \n<p>There is no requirement to show that the employee would have lost their job without the payment. Under the scheme, employees can also be asked to take leave by their employers if they have more than two weeks accumulated.</p> \n<p>This is very different to the UK scheme, where businesses nominate furloughed workers who are not needed at the business in order to qualify for support for that worker which is 80% of their wage, up to a cap of \u00a32,500 pounds.</p> \n<p>This percentage approach obviously avoids the problem of the uni student getting more than they did before.</p> \n<p>It also provides, unlike the Australian scheme, a way to wind back the support as business picks up. From August, UK employers can start bringing furloughed employees back part-time and start \u201csharing in the cost of the scheme\u201d.</p> \n<p>The Australian scheme however has some serious problems in the recovery phase.</p> \n<p>The 30 or 50% fall in turnover \u2013 the threshold for eligibility \u2013 was calculated at the start of the pandemic.</p> \n<p>A business had to demonstrate fall in GST turnover by comparing either a month or three months revenue to the same period in 2019 to show a 30 or 50% decline.</p> \n<p>For some that was easy. Restaurants and bars had immediately shut. Some retail chains also chose to close as malls became deserted.</p> \n<p>But as people emerge from isolation, and shops, pubs and restaurants reopen, there\u2019s no ability for the government to reassess whether these businesses still need jobkeeper. Most probably do but the payment increasingly becomes a subsidy to the business, not a wage replacement, as the businesses start earning again and can pay their workers.</p> \n<p>There is also anecdotal evidence that industries with lumpy cashflow, such as trades and construction, have been able to engineer a 30% fall in a month, by postponing invoicing clients, in order to qualify for jobkeeper.</p> \n<p>Some of these sectors, notably the housing sector, might start feeling real pain as the jobkeeper payment runs out.</p> \n<p>Work by Deloitte Access Economics shows that the recovery will be very uneven and that some jobs may disappear permanently, raising questions about what will happen after September.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"747d7e6a-15d0-47fa-8084-24575975fcad\" data-atom-type=\"timeline\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Timeline\">\n    <p><i>(June 1, 2020)</i>&nbsp;<strong>What's due to end?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>28 June \u2013 Free childcare: government pays 50% of usual support plus jobkeeper to centres. <b>Cost: $1.6bn over three months, or roughly $131m a week</b></p>\n    <p>30 June \u2013 Instant asset write-off (must buy the asset and take delivery by 30 June). <b>Unknown cost</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(July 1, 2020)</i>&nbsp;<strong>What's due?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>13 July \u2013 Second (and currently last) economic support payment of $750 to 6.5m pensioners who do not receive extra Covid support under jobseeker. <b>Cost: $8bn</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(September 1, 2020)</i>&nbsp;<strong>What's due to end?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>25 September \u2013 Moratorium on bankruptcy, insolvency applications.</p>\n    <p>27 September \u2013 Jobkeeper. <b>Cost: $70bn</b>.

When jobseeker payments fall [back to Newstart levels] it will affect growth further,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn previous crises we have tried to give money to people who need it and who will spend it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the conundrum the government needs to sort out. It needs to find a transition pathway.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the meantime, there are plenty of changes that could be made to the existing jobkeeper payment to make it fairer.</p> \n<p>The small business ombudsman, Kate Carnell, says she is particularly concerned about small businesses that operate as partnerships, a common legal structure for family business and services.</p> \n<p>Under the jobkeeper rules, only one partner can get jobkeeper while the other partner or partners must apply for jobseeker, which is $300 a fortnight less.</p> \n<p>Yet if the enterprise was incorporated they would be able to apply for jobkeeper for all eligible employees, Carnell said. \u201cThis is dumb stuff and I hope the government will look at it.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cBut generally, jobkeeper has been a lifeline and the feedback we get from business is that they say: \u2018I don\u2019t know what I would have done without it\u2019. More than 75% of business is trading,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>The universities sector is also calling on the government to use the $60bn miscalculation to revisit their sector\u2019s exclusion from the scheme.</p> \n<p>The Universities Australia chief executive, Catriona Jackson, said the sector faces the loss of 21,000 jobs in the next six months if nothing is done.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe were disappointed that government has changed the regulations on a number of occasions to effectively exclude universities.

He highlighted different fees paid in different jurisdictions for the same courses.</p> \n<p>Getting skills and training right in the recovery phase will be an important part of the response, but it also involves having a clear vision of where the jobs of the future will be and helping businesses recognise the importance of apprenticeships as they grapple with the recovery.</p>",
  "<p>My friend and former colleague Robert Burchell, who has died aged 79, was a historian of the US whose career saw a huge growth in the subject\u2019s popularity in the UK. He was professor of American history at the University of Manchester and the first director of the Eccles Centre for American Studies at the British Library.</p> <p>Born in Plymouth, Bob was the son of Lucy (nee Symons) and Arthur Burchell, an electrician at the Devonport submarine base. His earliest memories were of South Africa, where the family moved for a few years after being bombed out during the second world war. Returning home, he attended Plymouth college and won a place at Oxford to study modern history, graduating in 1963. He then spent a year at the University of California, Berkeley. </p> <p>After two years as a senior scholar at Queen\u2019s College, Oxford, in 1965 he became a lecturer at the University of Manchester, where he was eventually appointed professor in American history. For a decade from 1981 he supported the British Association for American Studies in efforts to expand the study of US history in the UK, becoming its chair in 1987. In 1991 he became the first director of the Eccles Centre, retiring in 2001.</p> <p>Eventually Bob would visit all save two of the US states but California had a special allure: his most important book, The San Francisco Irish, 1848-1880 (1979)<em>,</em> combined statistical data with personal accounts to reveal how Irish immigrants adapted surprisingly well to life on the Pacific coast. A master of statistical methods, he published a number of closely researched articles challenging standard interpretations of American elections and immigration patterns. He also worked with the US embassy and the Fulbright Commission to fund visiting academic fellowships in the UK and US and to improve resources for libraries.</p> <p>A serious scholar and challenging, occasionally sardonic, teacher, Bob also excelled in administration. He was a tall man, and used his height, wit and political nous to commanding effect. </p> <p>Bob collected china, glass and Penguin books, and was very private: layers of irony, affected detachment and gloriously ribald stories were a shield. He could appear forbidding, but his wide circle of friends appreciated his kindness and loyalty. His cultivated eccentricity left a vivid impression \u2013 as when, his car once having broken down on the open road, he left it there for good, to the relief of his passengers.</p> <p>In 2006 Bob entered into a civil partnership with Stephen Torr. </p> <p>He is survived by Stephen, his nephew, Mathew, niece, Becky, great-niece, Davey, and great-nephew, Jarrah.

  "<p>During Dominic Cummings\u2019 bolshy defence of his cross-country tour to Durham, breaking lockdown regulations, he centred on his \u201cexceptional\u201d need for childcare. This led him to drive 260 miles to his parents\u2019 farm after his wife started to feel ill.</p> <p>In cobbling together this narrative during yesterday\u2019s lengthy press conference, the prime minister\u2019s senior adviser seemed to rely on a loophole in the government\u2019s quarantine laws. After the guidelines were imposed in March to counteract the Covid-19 outbreak, a clause was subsequently added to provide protective measures for women and children stuck in domestic abuse households: the lockdown could be broken in these exceptional circumstances, where vulnerable people were in danger. Cummings, the chief strategist in the government that devised this rule, surely knew that safeguarding women and children from abuse and neglect was the intention.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/26/dominic-cummings-boris-johnson-terrified-sack-him\">The truth about why Cummings hasn't gone: Johnson is too terrified to sack him | Marina Hyde</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For thousands of women and children, the government\u2019s \u201cstay at home\u201d slogan never meant staying safe. It\u2019s tough to think of how many people tuned in to yesterday\u2019s press conference from their personal prisons with abusers close by, to watch Cummings slalom through his account, refusing to apologise for any actions and justifying \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d that saw him act on \u201cinstinct\u201d. His use of \u201cvulnerable\u201d as a descriptor was particularly striking. For many, the coronavirus pandemic has created exceptional needs and issues, but the public health crisis only magnifies the suffering of society\u2019s most truly vulnerable \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/15/domestic-abuse-killings-more-than-double-amid-covid-19-lockdown\">domestic violence has proven the most stark</a>. There are many \u201cinstincts\u201d people have been forced to forgo to supposedly \u201cstay safe\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Cummings saga has distracted us from the fact that with more people confused and angry, more lives are at risk</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As the pandemic spread, with workplaces and schools closing, women\u2019s organisations and child abuse charities pushed for protections that would allow domestic abuse survivors and their offspring to legally exit their home. Activists warned of a potential surge in domestic violence, but women\u2019s safety was never a priority in the preparations. Calls to the NSPCC <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-52473453\">rose by a fifth</a> in the first month of lockdown, while Refuge, the UK\u2019s largest domestic abuse charity, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/12/domestic-violence-surges-seven-hundred-per-cent-uk-coronavirus\">recorded a 25</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/12/domestic-violence-surges-seven-hundred-per-cent-uk-coronavirus\">% increase</a> in calls and police highlighted a 3% increase in incidents across England and Wales. <a href=\"https://kareningalasmith.com/counting-dead-women/\">The Counting Dead Women project</a> has documented at least 14 suspected domestic abuse killings of women and children from when lockdown began on 23 March to mid-April.</p> <p>In exploiting this loophole in the rules, Cummings casually placed his predicament alongside the lived reality for women who suffer domestic violence. For them, the days aren\u2019t punctuated by 12th-century castle trips or jaunts through their parents\u2019 bluebell woods; it is terror in a tower block or emotional abuse over a dinner table, fearing for your life as you put your kids to bed.</p> <p>Domestic abuse sadly is not \u201cexceptional\u201d: for some it is horrifyingly mundane and lockdown has only exacerbated an insidious, shrouded crisis. It is its own enduring epidemic, one that this government has fallen abhorrently short on ever addressing. Pre-lockdown, domestic incidents and crimes in Northern Ireland were the highest since records began 15 years ago \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/northern-ireland-domestic-violence-all-time-high-funding-urgently-needed-frontline\">rising a further 15</a><a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/northern-ireland-domestic-violence-all-time-high-funding-urgently-needed-frontline\">%</a> in March. The long-awaited domestic abuse bill for England and Wales meanwhile, a hangover from Theresa May\u2019s government, recently reached its second reading. Though the bill brings in new protections \u2013 such as long-term bans on abusers contacting survivors \u2013 it lacks protections for women and children in refuges and doesn\u2019t address immigration status. The offer of additional funding is not nearly enough for overstretched frontline services \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.womensaid.org.uk/womens-aid-comments-on-government-announcement/\">Women\u2019s Aid</a> has estimated that at least \u00a348m is needed, with special aid for BAME and migrant services.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/26/lying-government-coronavirus-crisis-dominic-cummings\">We can't trust this lying government to steer us through the coronavirus crisis | Zoe Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cummings exploited a guideline intended for people in far more vulnerable situations, and the government he works for doggedly defends him doing so. Meanwhile its apathy elsewhere continues to endanger the lives of vulnerable women and children, with inequalities entrenched through years of austerity and callous cuts. From Northern Ireland\u2019s failure to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/13/abortion-northern-ireland-coronavirus-women-stormont-rights\">provide adequate abortion services</a> to single mothers and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-women-britain-trfn/women-and-low-paid-among-worst-hit-by-uk-coronavirus-job-cuts-idUSKBN21O1P0\">women bearing the brunt of job losses</a>, the pandemic remains a feminist issue.</p> <p>The Cummings saga has distracted us from this: with more people confused and angry, more lives are at risk. Chronic stress and anger only exacerbates abusive incidents. The impact of coronavirus has shone a light on deep-rooted social disparities \u2013 yes, childcare is a crisis we need to address, but hardly for the multi-housed elite. On average, <a href=\"https://www.wral.com/coronavirus-is-killing-more-men-but-the-lockdown-is-disastrous-for-women-and-their-rights/19112079/\">women spend 4.1 hours a day doing unpaid domestic and care work</a> compared with 1.7 hours by men, and single parents have been affected significantly by school closures. </p> <p>We cannot allow a ruling cabal \u2013 which banks on outsmarting and gaslighting the public \u2013 exploit for their own ends what little there is to protect women and children.

  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s favourite hobbies seem to consist of golf, Twitter and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/26/muslim-americans-trump-travel-ban\">banning people from the US</a>. Alas, he may no longer have the opportunity to do as much of the latter, because who would now want to come to the US anyway? The country is doing such a bad job of containing coronavirus that you are better off almost anywhere else. Indeed, last month, a number of American citizens in Lebanon declined a repatriation offer, saying they were <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/09/middleeast/us-citizens-lebanon-coronavirus-intl/index.html\">safer in Beirut</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just a trip to the US that looks unappealing right now; it seems many countries aren\u2019t exactly salivating at the prospect of hosting American visitors in the near future. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, for example, called the border with the US a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/us-canada-border-coronavirus/index.html\">clear \u201cvulnerability\u201d</a> for Canada in terms of infections; the US-Canada border has been closed since March, and will remain closed to nonessential travel until at least 21 June.</p> <p>Meanwhile, officials in Mexican border cities are reportedly <a href=\"http://www.therepublic.com/2020/05/24/lt-virus-outbreak-mexico-border/\">tightening checks</a> on visitors from Texas, because they\u2019re worried new coronavirus cases are coming from the <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/in-mexican-border-cities-many-fear-virus-is-coming-from-us\">American side of the border</a>. Which brings to mind a joke that is going around: what borders on stupidity? Canada and Mexico.</p> <p>An American passport used to be an asset, now it\u2019s looking rather more like a liability. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.afar.com/magazine/is-italy-reopening-and-when-will-i-be-able-to-visit\">Italy </a><a href=\"https://www.afar.com/magazine/is-italy-reopening-and-when-will-i-be-able-to-visit\">plans to </a><a href=\"https://www.afar.com/magazine/is-italy-reopening-and-when-will-i-be-able-to-visit\">reopen to </a><a href=\"https://www.afar.com/magazine/is-italy-reopening-and-when-will-i-be-able-to-visit\">travellers on June 3 \u2013but </a><a href=\"https://www.afar.com/magazine/is-italy-reopening-and-when-will-i-be-able-to-visit\">not to Americans</a>\u201d ran a recent headline in the travel magazine Afar. This is somewhat misleading: Italy is opening its borders and removing quarantine restrictions only for people from other countries in Europe, it is not singling out Americans. However, Americans aren\u2019t used to being told they can\u2019t do things and a screenshot of the article <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_amburgerrr/status/1263225000171102220?s=20\">quickly went viral</a>.</p> <p>While Italy might not have explicitly implemented an American ban (yet), it seems increasingly likely that \u2013 as the <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/with-coronavirus-american-travelers-are-about-to-find-out-what-its-like-to-be-the-pariah\">Daily Beast</a> put it \u2013 \u201cAmerican travellers are about to be pariahs in this new world.\u201d The travel industry is still figuring out how to keep tourists safe, but it makes sense that countries doing a good job of managing the pandemic will heavily restrict entry to travellers from those doing a poor job. And the US is doing an extremely poor job.</p> <p>Most worryingly, it feels as if Trump has given up trying to pretend to do any sort of job at all. The US neared the morbid milestone of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/24/new-york-times-front-page-1000-covid-19-death-notices\">100,000 dead </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/24/new-york-times-front-page-1000-covid-19-death-notices\">at the weekend</a>; Trump marked the occasion by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/25/donald-trump-twitter-coronavirus-golfing\">going to play golf</a> (without a mask) and shaking people\u2019s hands. When he wasn\u2019t teeing off he was mouthing off: calling Hillary Clinton a \u201cskank\u201d and ordering that states <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/22/donald-trump-churches-mosques-synagogues-reopen\">reopen places of worship</a>. It seems inevitable that Trump is going to do his best to open up the country way before it is safe, just because he is worried about the economy and his chances of re-election. Plus, Covid-19 is not exactly killing his base: it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/12/coronavirus-us-deep-south-poverty-race-perfect-storm\">disproportionately killing African</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/12/coronavirus-us-deep-south-poverty-race-perfect-storm\"> Americans</a>. To paraphrase <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/nov/04/george-w-bush-kanye-west\">Kanye West</a>\u2019s comments about George W Bush, I don\u2019t really think Trump cares about black people.</p> <p>\u201cThe coronavirus scenario I can\u2019t stop thinking about is the one where we simply get used to all the dying,\u201d the New York Times columnist Charlie Warzel <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/05/opinion/coronavirus-deaths.html\">wrote earlier this month</a>. Just as America has grown resigned to school shootings and preventable gun violence, he suggests, it looks as if it is becoming numb to Covid-19 deaths. Just as the US has prioritised the rallying call of \u201cfreedom\u201d over common sense gun control, it looks set to prioritise \u201cfreedom\u201d over public health. Looking at images from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/americans-defy-covid-19-social-distancing-rules-to-celebrate-memorial-day-holiday\">crowded pool parties</a> in Missouri over the weekend, looking at Trump\u2019s calls for schools to reopen \u201c<a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/trump-wants-schools-to-reopen-asap-americans-fear-they-wont-be-safe/ar-BB14y9HJ\">ASAP</a>\u201d, it seems as if that is exactly what\u2019s happening.

Then grill them until charred in places and nice and sticky.\u201d Taylor layers them with herbs, spring onions, nuts and ricotta.</p> <p>Whole cauliflowers have become a barbecue\u2019s best friend, but only when blanched first, then cooked slowly. \u201cA lot of vegetables take longer to cook on the barbecue than you might imagine,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cMy top tip is to set up your barbecue so that you have different zones of heat \u2013 only put charcoal on one side of the barbecue, so that you have the option to cook indirectly or directly over the fire.\u201d</p> <p>Taylor cooks the cauliflower over an indirect heat until tender, then slides it over the fire to caramelise. Then, says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/aug/10/greek-four-course-meal-recipes-aubergine-keftedes-courgette-salad-prawn-feta-pomegranate-sorbet\">Georgina Hayden</a>, the author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/taverna-9780224101646.html\">Taverna</a>, it is all about the finishing touches. She tosses her cauliflower in a mix of tahini, yoghurt, garlic, lemon and olive oil, then adds herbs and/or chilli. This works well with broccoli, too.</p> <p>Vinegar is a useful tool to contrast that charcoal flavour, says Neil Campbell, the head chef at Rovi in London: \u201cTry slicing white onions, mixing with apple cider vinegar, sugar and salt, then leaving to sit. Lightly grill some asparagus and green beans, then chop and toss them in the vinaigrette and throw in some basil.\u201d Onion also makes a cracking side to meat: \u201cCut red onions in half (skin on), then cook face down until they are pretty much black, then slip them off the direct heat and cook skin side down so they sweat and steam.\u201d Once they are done, Campbell removes the skin, slices the onions and adds Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper.</p> <p>On the allure of browned veg, Taylor says: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2014/jun/03/what-does-meat-taste-of-flavours\">The Maillard reaction</a> [the chemical process that occurs when proteins and sugars in your food are transformed by heat] is not exclusive to meat. Root veg, such as sweet potatoes or carrots, and peppers are all capable of the Maillard reaction, given the right temperature.\u201d Hayden suggests whizzing chargrilled peppers into a dip to serve with balsamic vinegar, basil and mozzarella, while Campbell proffers peppers slowly roasted with sherry vinegar, olive oil and oregano.</p> <p>To spice things up, look for inspiration from cultures where fire cooking is prevalent, says Taylor: \u201cIndian tandoor cooking, Mexico or south-east Asia, for all those wonderful marinades with lemongrass, lime leaves and coriander.\u201d And if you have some citrus fruits knocking around, toss them on to the grill, too, then squeeze over veg before serving.</p> <ul> <li><p>Do you have a culinary dilemma?

  "<p>The suspension of vaccination programmes, school closures and a surge in domestic violence during coronavirus lockdowns are likely to derail a decade\u2019s worth of progress for children, according to new global research.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://kidsrights.org/\">Kidsrights Foundation</a> on Tuesday published its <a href=\"http://www.kidsrights.org/kidsrightsindex\">annual rankings</a> of children\u2019s rights in 182 countries with Iceland scoring top for the second year running followed by Switzerland, Finland and Sweden.</p> <p>The UK fared poorly, ranking in 169th place behind countries including Sudan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Yemen. The country\u2019s poor treatment of Roma and Gypsy children was criticised while the UK\u2019s anti-terrorism strategy, Prevent, was found to have a stigmatising effect on Muslim children.</p> <p>British children\u2019s views were not systematically heard in developing policy that affects them, the report found. It also highlighted concerns around lack of legal aid while many children feel they are not listened to by social workers, paid carers, judges and other professionals working in family legal proceedings.</p> <p>Chad has fallen behind Afghanistan to reach the bottom of the rankings while Sierra Leone has the third worst result.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/15/will-we-die-of-hunger-how-covid-19-lockdowns-imperil-street-children\">\u2018Will we die of hunger?\u2019: how Covid-19 lockdowns imperil street children</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The advocacy group\u2019s chairman, Marc Dullaert, told the Guardian the pandemic would have a dire impact: \u201cOur index shows that even before Covid-19, countries were not allocating sufficient budgets around the protection of child rights. Now we expect the economic consequences of the crisis to turn the clock back 10 years on the progress made around the wellbeing of children, unless governments take swift action.\u201d</p> <p>Countries are scored using UN data and evidence collected from the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child. They are assessed across five areas including health, education, and enabling an environment that promotes child rights.</p> <p>\u201cOverall, we see two big red flags in the findings this year,\u201d said Dullaert. One is lack of government funding around children\u2019s health, education and protection.</p> <p>The other is around the discrimination of children with more than a third of countries having the lowest possible score in this area.</p> <p>\u201cWe see in 91 of 182 countries that girls do not have the same rights as boys in terms of inheritance rights, access to education and equal treatment in legislation. It is not only in developing countries that there is a problem with discrimination.\u201d</p> <p>Italy ranked 15th in the index, up from 74, after being commended for adopting laws on cyberbullying and protecting children with disabilities. It was criticised for smear campaigns against organisations helping migrants.</p> <p>The index is not an absolute ranking of countries where children have the best life but nations are scored relative to their capacity to implement children\u2019s rights.</p> <p>\u201cOnce we take this into account, surprising rankings might occur,\u201d said Professor Karin Arts, of the International Institute of Social Studies, who was among those who compiled the data.</p> <p>\u201cExamples are the ultra-low scores of Australia (135), New Zealand (168) and the UK (169), and the high ranks of Thailand (8) and Tunisia (17),\u201d she said.</p> <p>Australia has dropped from 19 last year to 135 because of the poor treatment of refugee and migrant children, as well as Aboriginal young people who were found to be discriminated against in ways that affected their rights to education and health.</p> <p>Dullaert said: \u201cIt is really sad to see that recent welfare reforms have pushed more children into poverty in a rich country like the UK. We are also concerned about children in detention who, because of the indirect impact of Covid-19, are effectively in solitary confinement and have nearly no contact with family or the outside world.\u201d</p> <p>The Kidsrights Foundation said the fallout from measures taken by governments to reduce the spread of Covid-19 would have lasting effects on children globally.</p> <p>School closures in 188 countries affect 1.5 billion children, leaving them vulnerable to child labour, child marriage and teenage pregnancy.</p> <p>\u201cMillions of children were out of school for a long period and we see especially in developing countries that, even after the easing of lockdown, there is an enormous drop-off rate, with large numbers of children failing to return to school again,\u201d said Dullaert. \u201cAs with the Ebola crisis, this will result in more children being put into work and early marriages for girls.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>My friend Susy Powlesland, who has died aged 90, was a radical educationist. With her husband, John, she set up the alternative Kirkdale school in south London in the mid 1960s. The school adhered to principles of self-sufficiency, equality and creative learning, focusing on the particular interests of the individual child. It ran for over a decade and created a community that still exists today.</p> <p>Susy was an only child born to Jewish parents, Emilie (nee Preis) and Felix Michlowitz, in Vienna, where her father ran a watchmaking and jewellery business. When she was nine the family managed to get on the last train out of Austria before the border was sealed at the approach of the second world war. They were billeted initially in London but were driven out by the blitz, and taken in by a woman in Reading, where Susy never felt fully at home.</p> <p>She attended local schools, and after leaving Kendrick girls\u2019 grammar school at 16 trained as a nursery nurse in Reading, then was accepted for teacher training at the residential Gypsy Hill Training College, in Kingston, Surrey. She taught at primary schools in Stratford, east London, and in Leicestershire. She met John Powlesland when they worked together at Forest School camps. They married in 1954 and later settled in London.</p> <p>Susy was keenly attuned to racial and religious intolerance, and had a passion in particular for the underdog and outsider. In his 2007 book The Islamist, Ed Husain describes a terrifying incident when a group of National Front thugs threatened him and other Muslim school children in a local playground. Susy and the other teachers raced to the side of the children and roared at the shaven-headed bigots.</p> <p>Susy lived in Tower Hamlets for more than 40 years. During her headship at Sir William Burrough school (1980-95) she had a huge impact on the children and families. She went out of her way to support newly arrived Bangladeshi children, especially those without immediate family. In the 1980s, she learnt some Sylheti and travelled to Bangladesh to learn more about the cultural background of her pupils.</p> <p>In 1984 she was the driving force behind the establishment of the Limehouse Housing Project, whose chief aim was to improve the lives of black and minority ethnic communities through the provision of good quality housing. In 2003 she co-founded a new local charity called the Globe Community Project, which aims to provide activities for young and old residents from diverse communities. She was appointed MBE in 2007 for services to BAME people in east London.</p> <p>After retirement, she became interested in meditation and Buddhism and was ordained into the Triratna Buddhist Order in 2003, taking the name Shraddhapuspa (Flower of Faith). She brought her dedication to children and families into her Buddhist life and remained active in her charity roles and her Buddhist teaching commitments until the final weeks of her life.</p> <p>John died in 1977. Susy is survived by their children, Stephen, Helen, Francis and Ayen, and grandchildren, Zak, Jasmin, Zain and Zachran.</p>",

He wasn\u2019t aware of the risk to the Juukan site, or its destruction, until Monday.</p> <p>\u201cIt will provide for agreements between traditional owners and proponents to include a process to consider new information that may come to light, and allow the parties to be able to amend the agreements by mutual consent,\u201d he said. \u201cThe legislation will also provide options for appeal should either party not be compliant with the agreement.\u201d</p> <p>In its submission to the legislative review, Rio Tinto said it was broadly supportive of the proposed reform but that consent orders granted under the current system should be carried over, and that rights of appeal should be fixed, not broad or subject to extensions, lest it \u201cprolong approvals or appeals processes at a critical point in the project.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman from Rio Tinto said the company had a relationship with the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people dating back three decades, \u201cand we have been working together in relation to the Juukan area over the past 17 years\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cRio Tinto has worked constructively together with the PKKP People on a range of heritage matters and has, where practicable, modified its operations to avoid heritage impacts and to protect places of cultural significance to the group,\u201d the company said.</p> <p>The mining company signed a native title agreement with the traditional owners in 2011, four years before their native title claim received formal assent by the federal court.

Most inland archeological sites in Australia show that people moved away during the Ice Age between 23,000 and 19,000 years ago, as the country dried up and water sources dried up.

At all stages we were assured that the association had the support of the large majority of vice chancellors for a fair industry-wide solution to the current crisis. </p> \n   <p>It\u2019s now clear the AHEIA was either not representing a broad coalition of vice chancellors, or negotiated an agreement that gives employees more rights and protections than some vice chancellors were willing to tolerate. It is up to AHEIA to explain why at least 17 of its members have abandoned the solution it negotiated on behalf of the universities.</p> \n   <p>The worst crisis in the history of Australian universities demanded a collective solution to save careers and livelihoods. Too many vice chancellors are now baulking at the strong oversight provisions in the jobs framework that guarantee transparency and ensure that any contribution our members make will be dedicated to saving jobs. </p> \n   <p>Vice chancellors appear to have abandoned their industrial association, and demonstrated they are allergic to scrutiny.

We sat on rickety old shares, there was a scuffed-up table. </p> \n   <p>The office looked like it had been saved from demolition. I noted the surroundings.

Our safety, our security, our social safety net of which we\u2019re so proud. </p> \n   <p>To strengthen and agree our economy, the boats we need to go faster are the hundreds of thousands of small and medium and large businesses that make up our economy and create the value upon which everything else depends. Value created by establishing successful products and services, the ability to be able to sell them at a competitive and profitable price, and into growing and sustainable markets. Economics 101.

  "<p>Greece fears a fresh standoff on its border with Turkey after the Turkish foreign minister suggested migrants and refugees would shortly return to the frontier as the two countries emerge from coronavirus lockdowns.</p> <p>Speaking to a local television station in Antalya, Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu said: \u201cDue to the pandemic, the movement of migrants has slowed down. But they will definitely want to leave after the outbreak is over.\u201d</p> <p>The statement set off alarm bells in Athens, where analysts are increasingly voicing fears of an iteration of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/06/refugees-europe-closed-tensions-greece-turkey-border\">the crisis that erupted earlier this year</a> when the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, declared the doors to Europe were open and migrants free to cross into Greece.</p> <p>After a hiatus of almost three months, Greek authorities reported several boats of men, women and children landing on the shores of Lesbos last week.</p> <p>Some 37,000 asylum seekers remain on the outposts in vastly overcrowded conditions that have been deplored by human rights groups.</p> <p>As a precautionary measure against coronavirus, Turkey sealed its north-western land frontier, demarcated by the Evros River in mid-March, but only after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/thousands-gather-at-turkish-border-to-cross-into-greece\">weeks of chaos and high drama</a> in which thousands attempted to cross the border amid a hail of rubber bullets and teargas fired by elite forces on either side.</p> <p>In recent days, there has been renewed tension over moves by Athens to extend a 12.5km-long razor wire fence along the frontier in land disputed by Ankara.</p> <p>\u201cAs the region gradually emerges from coronavirus lockdown, we are seeing a rise in tensions on all fronts,\u201d said Angelos Syrigos, professor of international law at Panteion University and an MP in the governing New Democracy party. \u201cIt is clear Turkey wants to continue weaponising migrants and refugees to extract European support for its geopolitical goals. My worry is that very soon we could see a new border crisis.\u201d</p> <p>Athens\u2019 centre right government, rallying EU support earlier this year, deployed riot police and military patrols to the land border while dispatching gunships and coastguard vessels to conduct around-the-clock patrols off the Turkish coast.</p> <p>But Frontex, the EU border agency that is participating in the patrols, has reportedly also predicted that the easing of coronavirus restrictions in Turkey will likely result in thousands of migrants and refugees attempting, once again, to cross into Greece. Internal documents seen by the German newspaper, Die Welt, suggested a mass movement of people towards the Greek-Turkish border and shores opposite outlying Aegean islands once internal containment measures are lifted. The document, dated 5 May, indicated that 262 officers had been seconded to bolster the Evros border region.</p> <p>In March, the Turkish interior minister, S\u00fcleyman Soylu, also warned that Europe-bound migrants would be able to return to the Greek-Turkish land border once the pandemic receded. \u201cWhen this epidemic is over we would not prevent whoever wants to leave,\u201d he said, after ordering the evacuation of men, women and children from the region. </p> <p>As home to more than 4 million refugees \u2013 more than anywhere else in the world \u2013 Turkey has repeatedly threatened to open the gates to Europe, arguing that Brussels has failed to provide adequate funding to host such numbers. The vast majority are displaced Syrians.</p> <p>Ankara\u2019s deteriorating economy and pressure on Erdo\u011fan himself has underpinned crisis fears. Hostility has risen noticeably in the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean where belligerent rhetoric from Turkey has been backed by brazen overflights over Greek isles and alleged harassment of patrol boats.</p> <p>Bilateral tensions come against a backdrop of disquieting reports of Greek authorities forcibly sending refugees back to Turkey. Allegations of expulsions have mounted in recent months with human rights activists accusing the government of exploiting the pandemic to engage in extrajudicial deportation of asylum seekers.</p> <p>\u201cWe are concerned about recent reports that have reached UNHCR of informal forced returns at Greece\u2019s borders over land and sea,\u201d said Boris Cheshirkov, the agency\u2019s spokesperson in Athens, describing the allegations as credible.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/14/coronavirus-cases-among-refugees-on-lesbos-spark-fresh-calls-for-evacuation\">Coronavirus cases among refugees on Lesbos spark fresh calls for evacuation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe have received reports of testimonies \u2026 and have approached authorities to express our concern and ask [them] to investigate and correct these practices if they are confirmed.\u201d</p> <p>Human rights groups claim conditions in island camps have also worsened as a result of restrictive measures to stem the spread of the virus. Although lockdown policies have gradually been lifted across Greece they are still enforced in holding centres with night curfews still in place.</p> <p>\u201cWe have seen a noticeable rise in all sorts of violence, from tent violence to sexual violence because people are forced to spend much more time in camps,\u201d said Apostolos Veizis, the medical director of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res in Greece. \u201cThese people are not treated as human but numbers. The situation for them is utterly inhumane.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>In the first few weeks of 2020, as president Donald Trump dismissed and mocked warnings about a novel virus killing people faraway in China, Native American leaders were taking the deadly threat seriously.</p> <p>And they were right.</p> <p>The infection rate among the Navajo Nation has now surpassed the state of New York, the centre of the pandemic in the US, and on Monday stood at 2,680 cases per 100,000 people compared with 1,890 in New York.</p> <p>The data emerging from some <a href=\"https://www.aisc.ucla.edu/progression_charts.aspx\">smaller tribes is even worse</a>. By mid-May, the known infection rate in the Pueblo of Zia, which has a population of 934 people, was 3,319 per 100,000 \u2013 ten times the rate of New Mexico where the tribe is situated, and almost double the rate of New Jersey \u2013 the second worst hit US state.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/24/us-native-americans-left-out-coronavirus-data\">Native Americans being left out of US coronavirus data and labelled as 'other'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The nearby Pueblo of San Felipe, population 3,544, is also badly affected with 3,301 known cases per 100,000. Reporting lags mean the actual infection rate for both tribes could be significantly higher.</p> <p>Coronavirus is novel to the world, but the impact on native communities is anything but a new experience. Native Americans feared the worst because they\u2019ve been here before many times.</p> <p> European colonizers introduced, sometimes deliberately, an array of new infectious diseases including measles, cholera, typhoid and smallpox, which for many decades historians believed were solely responsible for killing more than 70% of native people who had no immunity to these deadly foreign germs.</p> <p>\u201cMore than any other population in the country, the shared experience of surviving a pandemic is in our blood, it\u2019s not historic, it\u2019s current for American Indians, it\u2019s our reality. We took it seriously because we had to,\u201d said Desi Rodriguez-Lonebear, a social demographer at the University of Arizona and citizen of the Northern Cheyenne tribe in Montana.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"aa1079031cc39454f98e097a7abe5e71021aab28\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa1079031cc39454f98e097a7abe5e71021aab28/0_0_4693_3259/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Native Americans of the Navajo Nation people, pick up supplies from a food bank set up at the Navajo Nation town of Casamero Lake in New Mexico on 20 May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"694\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Native Americans of the Navajo Nation people, pick up supplies from a food bank set up at the Navajo Nation town of Casamero Lake in New Mexico on 20 May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a child, Rodriguez-Lonebear recalls being told by her grandfather not to play in certain spots where their relatives who died of smallpox and typhoid were buried.</p> <p>Now, it\u2019s increasingly thought that the cruel conditions of colonization such as forced displacement, enslavement and starvation created the perfect conditions for deadly disease outbreaks, according to Jeffrey Ostler, historian at the University of Oregon.</p> <p>\u201cThe impact of Indian removals like the Cherokee trail of tears forced people into horrific conditions of poverty and destitution. It wasn\u2019t just because they weren\u2019t immune, it was the conditions of colonization which made them vulnerable,\u201d said Ostler.</p> <p>This would also explain the lack of population rebound after each epidemic: the same horrific conditions caused low life expectancy and high infant and maternal mortality.</p> <p>Again, experts say that parallels can be drawn with what\u2019s happening today as the coronavirus pandemic rages across the US.</p> <p>The disproportionately high Covid-19 infection rates in Indian Country are attributed to chronic structural and economic inequalities such as overcrowded housing, understaffed hospitals, lack of running water and limited internet access \u2013 resulting from the US government\u2019s failure to comply with treaty obligations which agreed <a href=\"http://www.ncai.org/tribalnations/introduction/Tribal_Nations_and_the_United_States_An_Introduction-web-.pdf\">adequate funding for </a>basic services in exchange for vast amounts of tribal land.</p> <p>\u201cBack then, like today, tribes are trying to tackle a fatal virus without adequate resources. That\u2019s a strong historic parallel, the simple failure of the federal and state governments to provide the resources necessary,\u201d said Ostler.</p> <p>In addition, high rates of medical conditions like obesity, diabetes, heart and lung disease have contributed to worse Covid-19 outcomes. For instance in Arizona, the death rate for indigenous people is 42.8 per 100,000 \u2013 almost six times higher than for white people. In Mississippi, they are dying from Covid-19 at 10 times the rate of whites, according to analysis published last week by APM Research Lab.</p> <p>Native communities, who rely on their elders for oral history and traditions, are also concerned about the survival of their ancient cultures.</p> <p>\u201cWe are survivors of genocide, our numbers prove it\u2026 for nations with less than a thousand citizens, losing one person is too many,\u201d said Rodriguez-Lonebear. \u201cAnd losing even one of our elders threatens the future of our tribal nations as it means losing our language, oral histories and the cornerstones of our families and communities.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, the situation is likely worse as the data currently available is extremely patchy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e430681ba6953cd4b1610a13b738c2685b4ec11b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e430681ba6953cd4b1610a13b738c2685b4ec11b/0_0_4853_3365/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A nurse takes a swab sample from a Navajo Indian woman complaining of virus symptoms, at a testing center at the Navajo Nation town of Monument Valley in Arizona on 21 May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"693\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A nurse takes a swab sample from a Navajo Indian woman complaining of virus symptoms, at a testing center at the Navajo Nation town of Monument Valley in Arizona on 21 May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In New York, where significant ethnic disparities have emerged, no data is being collected on indigenous peoples. \u201cThis oversight is especially hammering\u2026 it\u2019s a painful blindspot in New York,\u201d said Andi Egbert, senior demographer at APMResearch.</p> <p>More than 70% of Native Indians and Alaskan Natives live in urban areas, where many use county and state health services where the data black holes exist.</p> <p>Native peoples with Covid-19 are being \u201celiminated from the data\u201d because their ethnicity is so frequently misclassified or ignored, according to Abigail Echo-Hawk, director of the national tribal epidemiology centre based in Seattle.</p> <p>\u201cWithout the data, we\u2019re going to keep dying and nobody is going to acknowledge that\u2026 and resources allocated by congress won\u2019t reach the communities,\u201d said Echo-Hawk.</p> <p>Over recent weeks, Trump and his supporters have pushed for America to reopen for business, even though scientists are still months from finding a vaccine or treatment.</p> <p>Yet native communities have demonstrated a greater historical awareness of the experience of pandemics, and tried to protect their citizens through measured emergency responses with limited resources, but which assert their right to self determination and governance.</p> <p>In South Dakota, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/sioux-coronavirus-roadblocks-south-dakota-governor\">tribes set-up roadblocks</a> to protect their citizens after the pro-Trump governor refused to issue a stay at home order.

  "<p>\u201cOur service users were all living on the margins before Covid-19, and this crisis has exacerbated their problems,\u201d says Sally Daghlian, chief executive of <a href=\"https://www.praxis.org.uk/our-work\">Praxis</a>. The charity, closely involved in uncovering the Windrush scandal, provides direct support for some 2,000 migrants and refugees a year, as well as training other providers and campaigning for changes in policy.</p> <p>Aware that not only current clients but many former clients too might struggle with self-isolation, lockdown and the closure of support centres, Praxis quickly started a new project. Six trained volunteers have been phoning ex-service users to assess their needs, provide advice and send out food parcels, as well as phones and tablets to allow these vulnerable people to stay connected as support and schooling moved online.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/25/nhs-surcharge-migrant-staff-government-campaign\">The NHS surcharge for migrant staff is gone. Why did it take such a fight? | Nesrine Malik</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Praxis has also been giving out emergency grants. Thousands of non-EU migrants, who require visas to work or study here, have a visa condition of \u201cno recourse to public funds\u201d (NRPF), so they cannot access any benefits, or Covid-19 crisis government support schemes, says Daghlian. \u201cNRPF should have been suspended at the start of this pandemic and it should be suspended now. It is causing enormous stress, hunger, and may lead to homelessness.\u201d </p> <p>Stephen Timms, the Labour MP for Newham, has even said that NRPF has \u201cundoubtedly contributed to the scale of Covid-19 fatalities\u201d in his constituency. It may also pose a risk to all our health, continues Daghlian: \u201cIf you can\u2019t feed yourself without working, you will go to work if you possibly can, even if you\u2019ve been exposed to Covid-19 or have symptoms.\u201d</p> <p>Migrants make up a disproportionate number of the workers in the frontline of the Covid crisis. <a href=\"https://www.compas.ox.ac.uk/2020/between-immobility-and-resistance-low-skilled-migrants-in-the-pandemic/\">In 2019</a>, around 20% of health workers were migrants, along with 18% of those in social care and 26% in the transport and storage sectors. They are also <a href=\"https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/migrants-in-the-uk-labour-market-an-overview/\">more likely than others to work in insecure employment</a>.</p> <p>\u201cSome migrants have worked here for years (and paid taxes) and NRPF hasn\u2019t been a problem,\u201d Daghlian continues, \u201cbut when a crisis like Covid-19 comes along and they lose their job, or worse, the family breadwinner, there\u2019s no safety net.\u201d</p> <p>Families who have lost their income may resort to using money saved for their next visa renewal, says Daghlian. Non-EU migrants (and potentially EU citizens as well after the Brexit transition period ends) must renew their visas periodically: in many cases every 2.5 years until they have been here 10 years and are able to apply for indefinite leave to remain. Each renewal can cost a family thousands of pounds, says Daghlian: \u201cThe government is profiteering. They have raised fees to extortionate levels that are causing real hardship.\u201d</p> <p>She cites the example of Praxis client Michelle (not her real name) from west Africa<strong>,</strong> who has two British children and works for the NHS in what the government would call an \u201cunskilled\u201d role. \u201cShe has been cleaning Covid-19 wards and feeding Covid patients\u201d explains Daghlian. \u201cWe clap every Thursday, but she was still expected to pay \u00a32,000 to renew her visa (which expired earlier this month) and \u00a31,000 of that was an NHS surcharge, required on top of her tax and national insurance, to allow her access to the NHS\u201d.</p> <p>Following pressure from all sides, the government last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/johnson-forced-to-drop-nhs-surcharge-for-migrant-health-workers\">dropped the NHS surcharge</a> for all those working in the health service, but it is not yet clear if this is retrospective. And while visas are being automatically renewed for many health workers and some social care staff until October, this does not apply to support staff, such as cleaners and hospital porters.</p> <p>The charity is helping Michelle apply for a fee waiver on grounds of destitution. Her case may be helped by a new court ruling that the <a href=\"https://theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/21/court-rules-home-office-setting-bar-too-high-for-visa-fee-waivers\">Home Office\u2019s definition of inability to pay is too harsh</a>. Applying for a waiver is complex, says Daghlian, and without support, some destitute migrants simply fail to renew their visas, becoming undocumented migrants with no rights at all \u2013 unable to legally work, rent a room, open a bank account or fully use the NHS.</p> <p>Some migrants are too scared to seek healthcare, says Daghlian. \u201cEveryone is meant to be entitled to GP care and A&amp;E does not turn people away, but a bill may be sent for hospital treatment. This terrifies migrants who have no money, and if the bill isn\u2019t paid in quite a short time, this is reported to the Home Office and can affect their application to remain.\u201d</p> <p>Although the government has stated that nobody will be charged for testing or treatment for Covid-19, Daghlian says not everyone knows this and \u201cI am sure there are migrants with the disease too afraid to go to the doctor.\u201d</p> <p>Particularly after Windrush, which saw thousands of legitimate UK residents treated as undocumented illegals, people are not confident of fair treatment. \u201cThe government sat on the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/windrush-lessons-learned-review\">Windrush</a> <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/windrush-lessons-learned-review\">Lessons Learned review</a> for a year,\u201d says Daghlian, \u201cthen finally published it in the midst of Covid-19. And the lessons haven\u2019t been learned.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe are now seeing a Windrush-in-the-making with EU citizens,\u201d she says, \u201cMany do not realise that even if they have been here for decades and have permanent residence cards, they have to apply under the settlement scheme or they will become undocumented.\u201d</p> <p>And one of the problems with Windrush <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/18/three-generations-of-windrush-family-struggling-to-prove-they-are-british\">(ongoing for some</a>) was that people did not have the documents to prove they were legal. Now, EU migrants are <a href=\"https://theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/20/unsettled-status-eu-citizens-want-card-to-prove-right-to-stay-in-uk\">not being given any physical document to prove their status</a>. \u201cThis is storing up trouble for the future\u201d she says.</p> <p>Daghlian\u2019s own family background \u2013 her paternal grandparents survived the Armenian genocide (1915-23) \u2013 makes her very aware of \u201cthe impact of xenophobia and nationalism\u201d and the importance of the right to refuge and migration.</p> <p>Covid-19 has exaggerated the issues Praxis addresses but, Daghlian says, \u201cthere was already a tsunami of need \u2026 deprivation, homelessness, people refused leave to remain who end up stateless, and a system so complex even the lawyers sometimes struggle to keep up.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/commentisfree/2020/may/24/despite-u-turns-migrants-to-britain-are-being-failed-miserably\">Despite U-turns, migrants are being failed miserably | Kenan Malik</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With most immigration work now ineligible for legal aid, the pressure on free services like that provided by Praxis\u2019s 20 expert advisers and solicitors, is enormous. </p> <p>Praxis is also keen to retain some of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/07/i-might-have-died-if-hadnt-rescued-me-hotels-for-homeless\">gains made for the homeless</a> through the emergency hotel accommodation scheme.

  "<p>For the past 10 years, I have chased up and down mountains in wind, rain, snow and sun. Walking, rock-climbing, swimming and camping: a trip into the hills is always intense, visceral and life-affirming. I love meeting the elements and discovering what the mountain has to offer on any given day. Nan Shepherd\u2019s seminal book on the Cairngorms, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/20/living-mountain-nan-shepherd-review\">The Living Mountain</a><em>, </em>opened my eyes to the many ways of perceiving a mountain.</p> <p>In picking these books, I\u2019ve steered away from the macho-mountain trend (not all hill-goers are male daredevils pitting themselves against nature). These stories of joy, wonder, fear and wisdom go some way towards filling the current void. Their voices lead me back into the remote high lands.<br></p> <h2>Space Below My Feet by Gwen Moffat</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"39400b27742f4d19b6704630c9edd589c7003589\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39400b27742f4d19b6704630c9edd589c7003589/0_333_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Climbers on the summit of Sgurr nan Gillean, Isle of Skye, Scotland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Climbers at the summit of Sgurr nan Gillean, Isle of Skye.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerry Neely/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Britain\u2019s first female mountain guide, Moffat discovered the \u201cfree and splendid world of mountains and mountain climbing\u201d in 1946, then deserted her post as a driver in the army and committed to a new way of life. Her spartan existence in postwar Britain included sleeping under hedges and washing in freezing tarns (activities that might now be re-branded wild camping and wild swimming). From Cornwall to north Wales, Langdale to Skye, these pages circle through landscapes that will be lovingly familiar to outdoors enthusiasts across the UK. Moffat pads barefoot up steep rock faces, teeters along icy edges, sleeps on frozen hay and picks watercress from clifftops. In crisp prose, this memoir describes many strange and delightful moments from a free-spirited lifestyle.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.waterstones.com/book/mountaineering-in-scotland-undiscovered-scotland-two-scottish-mountaineering-classics-combined-volume-1/w-h-murray/9781898573234\">Mountaineering in Scotland</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.waterstones.com/book/mountaineering-in-scotland-undiscovered-scotland-two-scottish-mountaineering-classics-combined-volume-1/w-h-murray/9781898573234\"> by WH Murray</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b33a1423ce0720d526f115ab37510ce6c47bb9f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b33a1423ce0720d526f115ab37510ce6c47bb9f6/0_0_375_500/375.jpg\" alt=\"Cover of Mountaineering in Scotland by WH Murray\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Famously written on sheets of toilet paper in prisoner of war camps across Europe, Murray had almost completed the first manuscript of Mountaineering in Scotland when the Gestapo found his precious sheets and destroyed the text. With the tenacity of a true mountaineer, Murray refused to be deterred: he rewrote the entire book; later stating that the Gestapo had done him a favour by forcing him to produce a much-improved second draft. Winter sunrise, moonlit nights and endless midsummer days \u2026 Murray captures the startling movements of light and weather in the mountains of Glen Coe, Ben Nevis and Skye. Struggling through snow and ice, delighting in the technical interest of rock climbs and looking out to dazzling views across land, sea and hills, Murray\u2019s book will appeal to anyone who loves the Highlands.</p> <h2><strong>The Snow Leopard</strong> by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/06/peter-matthiessen\">Peter Matthiessen</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"23ab15b9e015a92946387fc13010ee877c286840\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23ab15b9e015a92946387fc13010ee877c286840/0_0_4928_2958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Himalayas mountain valley view with white mountain peaks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Himalayas mountain valley view.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For mystics craving revelation, Matthiessen\u2019s quest is a gift. The Snow Leopard hails from the 1970s counter-culture era when spiritual seekers sought to dissolve the ego and achieve oneness. While many experimented with hallucinogenics, Jung and eastern philosophy, Matthiessen travelled to the Crystal mountain in the remote Dolpo region of the Nepalese Himalayas. Gentle, reflective journal entries recount his path towards enlightenment. Sights, sounds, people and nature are observed with a gentle curiosity; hopes and frustrations unfold alongside his desire to experience \u201cthe infinite in every moment\u201d. Walking with Matthiessen through Nepalese villages, high mountain passes and Buddhist monasteries is a privilege. Snow falls and prayer flags flutter as he journeys on, hoping for a glimpse of the near-mythic snow leopard.</p> <h2><strong>A Croft in the Hills</strong> by Katharine Stewart</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6fac9c88d1f043e1689686523229a468c5acd34b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fac9c88d1f043e1689686523229a468c5acd34b/0_0_1648_2560/644.jpg\" alt=\"Cover of A Croft in the Hills by Katharine Stewart\" width=\"644\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Perched atop the steep banks over Loch Ness is Abriachan, a scattered hilltop community with a rich crofting heritage. From hill fires to haymaking, calving to ceilidhs, Stewart brings this remote neighbourhood to life. Her portrait of 1960s crofting is not a romanticised image of escape and rural idyll: a precarious existence lived \u201cnear to the bones of things\u201d is described in simple, sharp prose. Among the snowdrifts, troublesome goats and interminable turnip drills, intimate relationships develop between people, animals and land.

Just three centuries ago, mountains and wild landscapes were revered but not seen as something to be conquered; now, each year, more than 350,000 people flock to the summit of Snowdon. Macfarlane\u2019s modern classic charts the cultural revolution in our attitude to high places. The route from sacred to awesome challenge is related through a colourful cast of mountaineers who have pushed into extreme terrain over the past few centuries. While the scientists, explorers, poets and climbers may set out with different goals, their mindset is broadly similar: from Coleridge to Mallory, each character is driven by a blend of curiosity, compulsion and the ability to tolerate extreme suffering. For keen hill-goers, this book is deeply reassuring. Since Macfarlane suggests that the imagination is key to being a mountaineer, then I can now count all my time indoors reading, dreaming and obsessing as legitimate mountain activity.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2006/oct/29/travelobituaries.travelbooks.escape\">A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush </a></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2006/oct/29/travelobituaries.travelbooks.escape\">by Eric Newby</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2a089892d4cba057721894c19964c97c194b8868\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a089892d4cba057721894c19964c97c194b8868/0_233_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Chiatibo glacier in the Hindu Kush mountain range.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Chiatibo glacier in the Hindu Kush mountain range.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neil Hall/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like no other mountaineering book, Newby\u2019s begins with a London fashion show. Frantically preparing the 1956 Spring Collection, Newby is struggling with an obstinate dress when he decides enough is enough and sends a fateful telegram to his friend, Hugh Carless. From here the book lurches from one misadventure to another as the hapless Englishmen travel to Nuristan, Afghanistan, to climb previously unconquered peaks. Sweating their way up steep roads and desolate gorges, past thundering torrents and mulberry trees, their story is narrated with a humour and modesty that will make you laugh aloud. However, the comedy does not disguise the fact that they were travelling through dangerous territory. One night, Newby awakes to see men in dark cloaks riding past, silently. The next day they find the body of a traveller whose skull had been smashed in with a rock. Vultures circle: Carless and Newby moved on, swiftly. Nuristan has since been the scene of intense guerrilla warfare and Taliban insurgency. This is a rare glimpse into a region that is now very much off-limits.</p> <h2><strong>The White Spider</strong> by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/jan/09/guardianobituaries.johngittings\">Heinrich Harrer</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"41156ad928745d4d02236a6592cf0972fc9c0663\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41156ad928745d4d02236a6592cf0972fc9c0663/4_6_302_468/302.jpg\" alt=\"Cover of The White Spider by Heinrich Harrer\" width=\"302\" height=\"468\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Not one for the faint-hearted. The action of this book takes place on the fearsome North Face of the Eiger. Avalanches, rockfall and brutal storms abound in Harrer\u2019s record of a significant period of mountaineering history. From 1935-1958, personal ambitions and national rivalries funnelled climbers from across Europe to take up ropes, crampons and ice axes in pursuit of a glorious new conquest: the first ascent of the North Face. Teamwork, competition, tactical retreats, heroic rescues and desperate tragedies unfold on this unforgiving, icy face. The White Spider takes readers to a place where few can follow. Harrer illuminates the profound lessons that are learned on the severe edges of our world.</p> <h2><strong>A Herd of Red Deer </strong>by Frank Fraser Darling</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"da5b87a6136fbf82e39f5eec62a39427c50f4530\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da5b87a6136fbf82e39f5eec62a39427c50f4530/0_0_5754_3452/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Red deer in the Highlands.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A red deer in the Highlands.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Wood/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Frank Fraser Darling\u2019s study transports you to the Scottish Highlands where, for two years, he followed a herd of red deer (in the remote north-west), observing how they live, eat, mate, socialise, raise young and respond to the environment. Darling is no detached observer: he seeks to build an intimacy with the deer and their habitat, spending hours in silence, emptying his mind and walking barefoot to raise the threshold of his awareness. I love the vivid descriptions of deer on the hill and the incredible insights gleaned through Darling\u2019s meticulous attention to his subject. This pioneering study was published in 1937, when studying animals in their natural environment was considered \u201cunscientific\u201d. Through Darling\u2019s words I see a little more of the \u201ctotal\u201d mountain: as a complex, social ecosystem.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/sky-burial-9780099461937.html\">Sky Burial </a></strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/sky-burial-9780099461937.html\">by Xinran</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"cb1e52127d551b3e79326df3c697d7cc16b5c657\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb1e52127d551b3e79326df3c697d7cc16b5c657/0_0_413_640/323.jpg\" alt=\"Cover of Sky Burial by Xinran\" width=\"323\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When Shu Wen\u2019s husband disappeared in Tibet, the young Chinese doctor set out on an epic journey into wild, unknown lands to find him. This extraordinary true story spans vast distances of space and time. Wen\u2019s journey begins in 1958, during the tumultuous years of the Chinese \u201cliberation\u201d of Tibet. Early in her search for answers, Wen is attacked by resistance fighters and rescued by a nomadic family. For 30 years she lives on the high plateau with Buddhist nomads. Cut off from the world, she slowly adapts to their way of life. Years pass, Wen ages, her skin darkens and her old identity fades, but still she clings to her husband\u2019s tattered photograph. Finally, Wen travels to the holy mountains, where she finds beautiful and devastating answers. War, peace, love, loss and reconciliation: this is a haunting book of immense power.</p>",
  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2><strong>Confirmed cases worldwide near 5.5m</strong></h2> <p>According to the Johns Hopkins university coronavirus tracker, infections worldwide number at least 5,495,061. The death toll stands at 346,232. True death tolls and cases are likely to be significantly higher due to differing definitions and testing rates, delays and suspected underreporting.</p> <h2><strong>WHO warns of \u2018second peak\u2019 in areas where Covid-19 is declining</strong></h2> <p>Countries where coronavirus infections are declining could still face an \u201cimmediate second peak\u201d if they let up too soon on measures to contain the outbreak, the World Health Organization said on Monday. WHO emergencies chief, Dr Mike Ryan, told an online briefing: \u201cWe cannot make assumptions that just because the disease is on the way down now it is going to keep going down and we are get a number of months to get ready for a second wave. We may get a second peak in this wave.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Mexico City records thousands more deaths than usual, amid doubt over official Covid-19 toll</strong></h2> <p>This year, Mexico City has issued <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/mexico-city-records-thousands-more-deaths-than-usual-amid-doubt-over-official-covid-19-toll\">8,072 more death certificates than the average</a> for the same period in the past four years, according to a new study that suggests the country\u2019s coronavirus death toll could be significantly higher than the official figure of nearly 7,400. The report\u2019s authors found 37% more death certificates were issued in April 2020 than that month\u2019s average during the previous four years. By the end of May they estimated the number may grow to 120%.</p> <h2><strong>White House brings forward Brazil travel restrictions by two days</strong></h2> <p>The US has amended the timing of its Brazil travel ban to come into force at 11.59pm Washington time on Tuesday. It came as Brazil recorded a daily death toll higher than the US for the first time (807 versus 620). Brazil has the world\u2019s second highest number of infections. In its original announcement, the White House said the travel restrictions would come into force on 28 May.</p> <h2><strong>Dutch PM Mark Rutte did not visit dying mother due to Covid-19 restrictions</strong></h2> <p>The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, was unable to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/dutch-pm-mark-rutte-did-not-visit-dying-mother-due-to-covid-19-restrictions\">visit his dying mother</a> in her final weeks because he obeyed coronavirus restrictions against visiting care homes, his office has said. His mother did not die of Covid-19, although there had earlier been an outbreak of the disease in the home where she was living, Dutch media reported.</p> <h2><strong>UK PM\u2019s aid refuses to apologise or resign over lockdown breach</strong></h2> <p>The British prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, has refused to apologise or resign for breaching lockdown rules. Cummings drove 264 miles from London to his parents\u2019 estate in Durham, despite suspecting that both he and his wife had coronavirus. Cummings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/dominic-cummings-refuses-to-resign-or-apologise-for-lockdown-breach\">also admitted to having taken a second trip</a>, to a beauty spot 30 miles from Durham, which he claimed was necessary to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/may/25/dominic-cummings-says-he-drove-to-barnard-castle-to-test-his-eyesight-video\">check his eyesight</a> was good enough for the longer drive back to London.</p> <h2><strong>WHO suspends hydroxychloroquine trial</strong></h2> <p>The World Health Organization has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/who-world-health-organization-hydroxychloroquine-trial-trump-coronavirus-safety-fears\">suspended testing the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine in Covid-19 patients</a> due to safety concerns. The WHO\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, cited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/22/hydroxychloroquine-trumps-covid-19-cure-increases-deaths-global-study-finds\">a paper published last week in the Lancet </a>that showed people taking hydroxychloroquine were at higher risk of death and heart problems than those who were not taking it. In light of the study, he said, the organisation would pause the hydroxychloroquine arm of its solidarity global clinical trial.</p> <h2><strong>Coronavirus measures \u2018disastrous\u2019 for children, says Dutch watchdog</strong></h2> <p>The coronavirus pandemic will have a \u201cdisastrous\u201d impact on children\u2019s rights worldwide, making them more vulnerable to forced labour and underage marriage, a rights group said on Tuesday.

  "<p>If you want to see how little the government would prefer things to change once the coronavirus pandemic has subsided, look at its immigration policy. Over the past few months the Home Office has fought hard to maintain the labyrinthine bureaucracy, exorbitant fees and harsh punishments that govern the lives of migrants from outside the European Union. Rules that ban some people from accessing NHS treatment, food banks and emergency housing have <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2020/may/the-hostile-environment-continued\">only been partially eased</a>; while detention centres have not been <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52560093\">fully evacuated</a>, and the Home Office has been accused of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/06/home-office-accused-of-pressuring-judiciary-over-immigration-decisions\">putting pressure on immigration judges</a> releasing detainees on bail. Concessions for NHS and care workers, meanwhile \u2013 on visa extensions for bereaved families, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/21/a-timeline-of-the-pms-u-turn-on-the-nhs-surcharge-a-timeline-of-pms-u-turn-nhs-surcharge-for-migrant-health-workers\">lifting the immigration health surcharge</a> \u2013 have only been made haltingly, after pressure from the public, the Labour party and even some Conservative MPs.</p> <p>The government has pushed ahead with its plans to extend much of this migration system to include EU citizens. The home secretary, Priti Patel, who has previously been criticised for <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/priti-patel-home-office-asylum-seekers-detention-coronavirus-a9480036.html\">avoiding scrutiny</a> during the crisis, began a publicity drive for the second reading of the new immigration bill. \u201cThis historic piece of legislation,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1283319/priti-patel-news-immigration-EU-free-movement-brexit\">Patel wrote</a> in the Express, \u201cends the European Union\u2019s free movement of people and lays the foundations to build a fairer, firmer, skills-led points-based immigration system.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Labour rightly pointed out the \u201chypocrisy\u201d of pushing through legislation that will prevent many health and care workers find work</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The bill, which passed its second reading in a parliamentary vote on 18 May, is being presented as the fulfilment of the central demand of Brexit voters. But it is better described as a leap in the dark. Rather than setting out what the new immigration system \u2013 due to come into force in January 2021 \u2013 will look like, it gives the government powers to amend the law as it sees fit, without bringing it back to parliament for full scrutiny. Key areas remain undetermined, such as rights to family union and permanent settlement, visas for NHS workers, and the treatment of trafficking victims and asylum seekers. The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI) <a href=\"https://www.jcwi.org.uk/immigration-bill-2020-second-reading-briefing\">describes</a> the bill as a \u201cblank cheque\u201d that will transfer EU citizens into \u201cthe same system as non-EU nationals which is dysfunctional and chaotic, with a long history of incorrect decision-making\u201d.</p> <p>To many people, the bill will seem an entirely fair proposition. It purports to offer a system based on merit \u2013 where \u201cpeople can come here based on their skills, not where they\u2019re from\u201d, as a slogan floating above the union jack, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pritipatel/status/1262430422954389504\">tweeted by Patel</a>, puts it. High earners and people with certain specialisms, such as research scientists, are in; \u201clower-skilled\u201d workers, who have jobs with salaries below \u00a325,600, are not. But this rests on a claim that has been exposed as false by the pandemic, which is that \u201clow-skilled\u201d workers are worth less to society, and easily replaced.</p> <p>Labour, which voted against the government on the second reading, rightly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/18/tories-accused-of-hypocrisy-over-key-workers-with-immigration-bill\">pointed out</a> the \u201chypocrisy\u201d of pushing through legislation that will prevent many health and care workers find work in the UK in future, and leaves a question hanging over the visas of some already here, even as these workers are publicly celebrated for their role during the pandemic.</p> <p>In truth, the contradiction was beginning to show even before Covid-19 arrived. When the immigration bill last came up for public discussion in February, a series of industry representatives warned they would face dire shortages if they were expected to replace workers from the EU by the start of next year. The public services union Unison warned of \u201cabsolute disaster\u201d in the care sector, while farmers and builders also said they would face labour shortages. At the time, Patel\u2019s response was that businesses should focus on training up the 8.5 million \u201ceconomically inactive\u201d people already resident in the UK, a figure that critics soon <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/51560120\">pointed out</a> was largely composed of people who were too old or too sick to work, or who were students or carers.</p> <p>This stance was regarded by some as a gaffe, yet it is consistent with Patel\u2019s ideology. Since becoming home secretary last year, she has openly positioned herself as an heir to Margaret Thatcher: so far the most prominent part of this has been her hardline stance on borders and crime, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/11/reckless-tory-pantomime-authoritarianism-thatcherism\">displayed</a>, for instance, at last October\u2019s Conservative party conference. But she is also an acolyte of Thatcherite economics. Patel, along with other ministers including the foreign secretary Dominic Raab, is a co-author of Britannia Unchained, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/22/britannia-unchained-rise-of-new-tory-right\">2012 book</a> by what was then a new crop of rightwing Conservative MPs who argued that the UK should strip away employment laws and other state protections to better compete with rival global economies. \u201cThe British are among the worst idlers in the world,\u201d the authors infamously declared.</p> <p>Although ending EU free movement has sometimes been dressed up as a way to protect British workers\u2019 interests, this is far from the government\u2019s primary concern. What\u2019s more likely is that it expects British residents to assume the same low-paid and precarious jobs that were previously being filled by immigrants from elsewhere in the EU. And when that proves impossible, the government will most likely look to create temporary exceptions that allow immigrants to take up jobs in sectors where there are labour shortages.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/25/nhs-surcharge-migrant-staff-government-campaign\">The NHS surcharge for migrant staff is gone.

The JCWI <a href=\"https://www.jcwi.org.uk/points-based-immigration-system-briefing-2020\">warns</a> that a temporary visa scheme for seasonal agricultural workers, which the government plans to expand to make up for the shortfall once free movement ends, is ripe for exploitation, and that workers \u201cwill have no meaningful way of challenging abusive employers\u201d.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t just an issue for the UK: countries around the world have belatedly discovered the need for people who clean, care and provide food, even though they are frequently underpaid and their jobs frequently reserved for those societies find easier to exploit: migrants from poorer countries and regions, women, and people from minority ethnic backgrounds. The pressure to keep these jobs going during a pandemic has opened up a debate in many countries about how they are valued: undocumented migrant workers in <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2020/may/invisible-in-the-fields\">southern Europe</a> and the US; Romanians flown in to pick <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/apr/16/western-europe-food-east-european-workers-coronavirus\">western European crops</a>; Ukrainians desperate to avoid travel restrictions <a href=\"https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/24830/ukrainian-workers-struggle-to-reach-the-eu-amid-coronavirus-restrictions\">to work in Poland</a>.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://spectrejournal.com/the-covid-19-crisis-and-the-end-of-the-low-skilled-worker/\">recent essay</a>, the labour researchers Sara Farris and Mark Bergfeld suggest that we stop calling the jobs that underpin the economy \u201clow-skilled\u201d and instead describe them as \u201clife-making\u201d.

We should go beyond the present situation, by preparing for post-pandemic conditions in the world.</p> \n   <p>There is an urgent need for Africa to develop new forms of resilience. In a world in which multilateralism is sorely tested, Africa must stop expecting solutions from others. Africa should no longer be satisfied with this role of never-ending reservoir for some, and dumping ground for others.</p> \n   <p>There is an urgent need for Africa to chart its own course. Its food dependency and insecurity are unacceptable and intolerable, as is the state of its road, port, health and educational infrastructure. Africa\u2019s land, forests, rich fauna, mines, energy potential, and maritime and inland waterways, hold the necessary resources to provide an adequate response to the needs of its peoples. We should, in full lucidity, boldly opt for an innovative approach that is inward-looking rather than outward-looking.
