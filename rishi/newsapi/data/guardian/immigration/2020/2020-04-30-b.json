The spike protein is the main target of leading vaccine programmes around the world, and if it changes too much those vaccines may no longer work.

The government cannot immediately ensure a return to normality ... we are still in this pandemic.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Autonomous moves by regions would be considered illegitimate, he added, opening the way for confrontations with regional chiefs set on defying the central government.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T14:01:54.973Z\">at 3.01pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eaad1b78f08a459b6585143\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T13:26:58.472Z\">2.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>It\u2019s <strong>Simon Murphy</strong> here taking over the live blog while my colleague, <strong>Alexandra Topping,</strong> takes a well-earned break.

<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not yet at the peak of the distress as a result of the lockdown. It will emerge over the coming weeks,\u201d said Sir Peter Gluckman, who was the chief science advisor to New Zealand\u2019s prime minister from 2009 until 2018.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWith that will emerge some groups of people who will do well, they will find in the change opportunity, but many people who will be very uncertain, very scared, frustrated, angry, and we know from other disasters that about 10% or more even will progress to actual depression and to suicidality.\u201d</p> \n  <p>However Gluckman also said the country possessed unique assets that could see it navigate the coronavirus crisis better than other nations would.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/emotional-fallout-of-covid-19-lockdown-yet-to-peak-says-new-zealand-scientist\">Emotional fallout of Covid-19 lockdown yet to peak, says New Zealand scientist</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eaa5da48f08745586318479\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/martinfarrer\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T05:10:32.755Z\">6.10am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In the UK, the cabinet will meet today to discuss <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/social-bubbles-of-small-groups-could-be-early-step-out-of-lockdown\">when to start easing the lockdown</a> as the government deadline for testing 100,000 people per day looks like passing without the target being reached.

Under that scheme, people are referred for help by their GPs. In some cases, volunteers have called the person \u201cin need\u201d and they have no idea why they are being contacted. Mutual aid networks, in comparison, work almost street by street, with most doors have had a flyer offering help pushed through the letterbox. These networks are also not hamstrung by concerns about data protection and privacy regulations or worries about insurance.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/sitting-at-home-seems-wrong-coronavirus-volunteers-helping-the-nhs-a-photo-essay\">'Sitting at home seems wrong': NHS coronavirus volunteers \u2013 a photo essay</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eaa57e48f0882b206dcfbe0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T04:55:09.300Z\">5.55am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Dr Deborah Birx, the White House\u2019s coronavirus taskforce coordinator is known for her reassuring appearances at Donald Trump\u2019s erratic and often astonishing White House press briefings.<br></p> \n  <p>Most recently, a video of her face <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/coronavirus-birx-trump-disinfectant-remarks\">as the US president suggested injecting disinfectant </a>into human beings might cure coronavirus went viral.

Below is a summary of the developments of the day. If you have any news tips or thoughts, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sarah_marsh_journalist/\">please do share them with me</a>.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Boris Johnson said the UK did the \u201cright thing at the right time\u201d.</strong> Johnson says people should understand that the collating of data internationally is bedevilled with difficulties. The only real comparison will be possible at the end of this, when you look at total excess deaths. He said<strong> </strong>the UK avoided an \u201cuncontrollable and catastrophic\u201d epidemic that could have caused 500,000 deaths and that we were now \u201cpast the peak\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>Following the lead of various world cities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/11/world-cities-turn-their-streets-over-to-walkers-and-cyclists\">including Bogot\u00e1 and Berlin</a>, Manchester has announced plans to close part of one of its main streets to cars</strong> and widen the pavements along others in order to help people walk and cycle safely while maintaining physical distancing \u2014 and move towards a car-free future.</li> \n   <li><strong>There have now been 26,771 coronavirus deaths in the whole of the UK in all settings, an increase of 674 on yesterday. </strong>These figures are just for people who tested positive for coronavirus. They do not include people who may have died from coronavirus who were not tested.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UK\u2019s Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has issued a stern warning that GCSE and A-level grade assessments this summer</strong> should not unfairly penalise children from minority ethnic minority backgrounds, as well as disabled pupils and those with special educational needs.</li> \n   <li><strong>More than 9,000 fines have been handed to people in England and Wales for allegedly flouting coronavirus lockdown laws, according to new figures.</strong> As PA Media reports, the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council<strong> </strong>(NPCC) said <a href=\"https://news.npcc.police.uk/releases/police-chiefs-welcome-positive-start-to-recruitment-drive\">8,877 fixed penalty notices (FPNs) had been recorded by forces in England between March 27 and April 27</a>, while 299 were issued in Wales over the same period. Some 397 were for repeat offenders, with one person fined six times.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eab03128f08fcc89d8bb448\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/andrewsparrow\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T18:01:05.979Z\">7.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Boris Johnson's press conference - Summary and analysis</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here are the main points from Boris Johnson\u2019s press conference.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Boris Johnson warned Britons that they could face an \u201ceven bigger\u201d coronavirus outbreak if the government rushed or mishandled the relaxation of the lockdown.</strong> He made the point in an opening speech which, while not giving any firm details of the government\u2019s plans, effectively paved the way for an announcement next week that seems likely to involve the lockdown being extended yet again in most significant respects. He made the point with a slightly confused Alpine metaphor. He said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have come through the peak.</p> \n   <p>Or rather we\u2019ve come under what could have been a vast peak, as though we\u2019ve been going through some huge alpine tunnel.</p> \n   <p>And we can now see the sunlight and pasture ahead of us.</p> \n   <p>And so it is vital that we do not now lose control and run slap into a second and even bigger mountain.</p> \n   <p>And so to avoid that disaster our fifth and final test is that nothing as I say we do should lift the R or the reproduction rate of that disease back above one.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Johnson then showed a video explaining the R number (the reproduction number - the rate at which a virus spreads) and why it was so important to keep this below 1.

We can\u2019t let the crisis happening now affect the future of disadvantaged pupils when so many, particularly disabled pupils and those of ethnic minority background, already face an uphill battle,\u201d Isaac said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAt this time it is critically important that public authorities meet the requirements of the public sector equality duty, and consider the needs and disadvantages facing pupils with different protected characteristics when they are deciding and implementing their response to the coronavirus emergency.\u201d</p> \n  <p>In its <a href=\"https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/our-work/news/predicted-grading-during-covid-19-could-limit-young-peoples-futures\">response to Ofqual\u2019s consultation</a>, the EHRC called for teachers to be told how to \u201cminimise the risk of conscious or unconscious bias\u201d in assessing pupils, and for pupils to have a \u201cmeaningful and timely route of appeal, including on grounds of suspected unlawful discrimination\u201d.</p> \n  <p>In March the government and Ofqual announced that formal exams for A-levels and GCSEs would be scrapped and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/03/gcse-a-level-grades-coronavirus-crisis-teacher-assessment-ofqual\">replaced by assessments</a> by schools, moderated by examination boards and Ofqual\u2019s formula to award individual grades to each pupil. Governments in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have adopted similar methods.<br></p> \n  <p>A spokesperson for Ofqual said: \u201cWe do recognise there are concerns about the potential for students to be disadvantaged by this approach and published an equality impact assessment, informed by a review of research literature on bias in teacher assessments, when our consultation was launched. We have and will be engaging further with organisations and groups that have raised concerns about this issue.<br><br>\u201cOur standardisation model will be designed to ensure, so far as is possible, that students are not advantaged or disadvantaged on the basis of their socio-economic background or because they have a particular protected characteristic.</p> \n  <p>\u201cStudents who do not feel their calculated grade reflects their performance will also have the opportunity to sit an exam in the autumn. We will shortly consult on details of the autumn exam series \u2013 we hope anyone with views about how the series might run, or its impact on particular students, will respond to our further consultation.\u201d<br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eaae7938f08fcc89d8bb28d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/andrewsparrow\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T15:20:02.552Z\">4.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">How much is coronavirus costing the government?</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here is a good question from below the line.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/140235887\"> \n   <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> \n    <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> \n     <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15629631\" title=\"View JellyBellyUK\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/15629631\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for JellyBellyUK\"> </a> \n    </div> \n    <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> \n     <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> \n      <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15629631\" title=\"View JellyBellyUK\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">JellyBellyUK</span> </a> \n     </div> \n     <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> \n      <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/140235887\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">30 April 2020 12:30pm</a> \n     </div> \n     <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\">\n      <p>@Sarah Marsh @Andrew Sparrow</p> \n      <p>How much have the government 'spent' so far on this coronavirus pandemic?

A similar proportion, 20%, said they worry a lot about losing their job or getting a new one.<br><br>Prof Karen Hughes, who coordinates the survey for Public Health Wales, added: \u201cWeek on week, we are monitoring the views and behaviours of people in Wales during the coronavirus restrictions.

Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The prime minister\u2019s spokesman again played down the prospect of any significant change to the lockdown next week, saying it would be wrong to \u201cgamble away\u201d what has already been achieved.</strong> No 10 has been transmitting this message for some days, but this seemed to be an even stronger hint that people should not expect too much from the review of the lockdown due by Thursday next week. The spokesman said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We don\u2019t want to relax the social distancing measures or do anything which could lead to the virus, which the British public have done so much to suppress, being able to spread in an exponential way again, and that will guide our approach as we move forward. People have made huge sacrifices in order to bring down the rate of infection, to protect the NHS and ultimately to save lives and we are not going to gamble those sacrifices away by taking steps that could lead to an exponential growth in the disease again.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>When asked if the lockdown could continue until June, the spokesman said people would have to wait for the government decision. But he also reminded reporters of what <strong>Prof Chris Whitty</strong>, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, has said about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/27/uk-coronavirus-live-news-boris-johnson-back-at-work-amid-talk-of-easing-lockdown?page=with:block-5ea7112c8f0821d5b0274a47#block-5ea7112c8f0821d5b0274a47\">how the virus will be around for a significant period of time.</a> The spokesman went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>As the PM himself has said, the worst thing we could do is relax the social distancing measures too soon and throw away all of the progress that has been made.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said that Sage, the scientific advisory group for emergencies, is still examining the impact that different relaxation measures might have on R, the reproduction number (the infection rate of the virus), and that it did not present any findings to cabinet today.</strong> This work will be crucial because the government will only implement measures relaxing the lockdown that, taken together, do not push R above 1.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said Boris Johnson chaired a political meeting of cabinet before the normal cabinet today.</strong> At normal cabinet ministers received updates from Whitty and <strong>Sir Patrick Vallance</strong>, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman came close to ruling out the lockdown measures being eased region by region, instead of on a UK-wide basis. </strong>Yesterday <strong>Michael Gove</strong>, the Cabinet Office minister, said that although he favoured maintaining a UK-wide approach, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/29/uk-coronavirus-live-priti-patel-questions-response-covid-19-crisis-pmqs-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ea9a2728f08745586317f39#block-5ea9a2728f08745586317f39\">there might be a case for letting island communities do their own thing.</a> But the spokesman played down the prospect of this happening. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We did consider, when we introduced the social distancing measures, bringing them in in some parts of the country ahead of others. We decided not to do that. We decided it was more effective to bring in the measures on a nationwide basis.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The spokesman indicated that this would be the approach the government would follow going ahead. He also said all four nations of the UK were keen to carry on moving ahead as one.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman refused to concede that the government was not likely to meet its target of getting coronavirus testing up to 100,000 per day by today. </strong>He pointed to the progress made in recent weeks towards hitting this target as evidence that testing had intensified.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman was unable to cite evidence defending a claim that \u201cpublic confidence in the media has collapsed during this emergency\u201d.</strong> At the end of last week another Downing Street spokesman made that claiming in a response to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/revealed-dominic-cummings-on-secret-scientific-advisory-group-for-covid-19\">the Guardian\u2019s story about Dominic Cummings taking part in Sage meetings </a>that included the line: \u201cPublic confidence in the media has collapsed during this emergency partly because of ludicrous stories such as this.\u201d Asked to defend the statement, the spokesman, who is a civil servant, said this was a matter for his party political press colleagues (who also speak on the PM\u2019s behalf). As this YouGov chart illustrates, polling suggests that the crisis has not led to a collapse in trust in the media.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/YouGov/status/1255495374984404995\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">No, trust in the media has not collapsed because of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronavirus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#coronavirus</a> - trust for journalists remains much the same as it was prior to the crisis<a href=\"https://t.co/eqeVWROBhl\">https://t.co/eqeVWROBhl</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/ymuIAwmRmR\">pic.twitter.com/ymuIAwmRmR</a></p>\u2014 YouGov (@YouGov) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YouGov/status/1255495374984404995?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 29, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said Johnson would be taking part in the Clap for Carers event tonight.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman refused to give any more information about the PM\u2019s new baby son. </strong>He would not even say whether or not Carrie Symonds and the baby remained in hospital.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11e9d2badddeda46e073a071cbb619f42d02ea99\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11e9d2badddeda46e073a071cbb619f42d02ea99/0_33_3400_2041/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prof Chris Whitty.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prof Chris Whitty.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Niklas Halle\u2019n/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T13:03:41.343Z\">at 2.03pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eaac02b8f08b27d8fdd73a1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/owenbowcott\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T12:31:22.150Z\">1.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>An attempt to overturn the judiciary\u2019s temporary freeze preventing evictions and home repossessions during the pandemic is being made in the court of appeal.<br></p> \n  <p>Lawyers for an insolvency firm have lodged an emergency application over the alleged failure to keep up payments on mortgages on two houses in Hertfordshire that were already the subject of a legal dispute.</p> \n  <p>The judicial practice direction ensuring that no one would lose their homes during the outbreak or be the subject of legal action that could result in being made homeless was authorised by the master of the rolls, Sir Terence Etherton, who is head of the civil judiciary in England and Wales.</p> \n  <p>Philip Rainey QC, acting for Mehmet Arkin, an insolvency practitioner, told the court of appeal in a hearing conducted over remote video links on Thursday, that the rules were \u201cultra vires\u201d - having not been made in accordance with the law.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s particularly important during an emergency that restrictive measures have a proper basis in law,\u201d Rainey told the court. \u201cThere are very good reasons why parliament would wish to impose restrictions on what would normally be acceptable in a democracy but there must be a proper legal basis.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The practice direction used by the judiciary, number 51.2, only refers to matters that the courts are \u201cpiloting\u201d as experiments within the court system, Rainey said. It could not legally be the basis for the suspension of repossession actions which had been imposed.</p> \n  <p>But Sir Geoffrey Vos, chancellor of the high court, suggested that the practice direction had been imposed in an emergency and that it was effectively \u201ctrialling\u201d changes to the rules. \u201cThis is to see what measures can deal with [cases] in the context of a clogging up of justice\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Lady Justice Simler said the emergency rules did not prevent access to justice but merely imposed a 90-day delay on the process of house repossessions.</p> \n  <p>Lawyers for the justice secretary, Robert Buckland QC, have intervened in the case because of its significance.</p> \n  <p>The Housing Lawyers Practitioners Committee has also been permitted to intervene. In a statement issued before the hearing, the organisation\u2019s co-chairs, Marina Sergides and Simon Mullings, said: \u201cThe issues are crucial to our members and their clients.\u201d</p> \n  <p>In their legal submissions to the court, lawyers for the HLPA said: \u201cIf the appellants succeed in persuading the court that [the practice direction] is ultra vires then [this freeze] will cease to apply to all possession claims.\u201d</p> \n  <p>That would expose many vulnerable people to losing their homes during the lockdown, they argued. \u201cA significant proportion of members\u2019 clients are also vulnerable as a result of physical and/or mental health problems, as a result of which they find it difficult properly to understand information and provide their solicitors with documents and instructions even face-to-face.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The submission added: \u201cThis is a time when litigants, particularly those of limited means, are liable to find it particularly difficult to engage with the courts and with their lawyers if they have them. Practitioners and the courts are under exceptional pressure and the resources available to them are depleted. The provisions take effect for a temporary period while court procedures in response to Covid-19 are evaluated and they are subject to review.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The hearing continues.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T12:36:19.435Z\">at 1.36pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eaac2608f0874558631881d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/rebeccasmithers\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T12:20:00.270Z\">1.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Consumers still panic-buying toilet roll have another option from today.

The Tory-run county councils\u2019 network was furious that its members, all of which provide social care services, had recevied a 29% cash reduction compared with the first bailout, and faced a collective financial shortfall of \u00a3600m.</p> \n  <p>Cllr David Williams, the county councils\u2019 network chair, said: \u201cUnless a solution is forthcoming to address these growing additional pressures as the crisis goes on, and, crucially, our lost income, it is inevitable that the resources in shire counties made available to life-critical social care services will be reduced, resulting in extremely difficult choices facing our member councils.</p> \n  <p>\u201cMost importantly, unless further support is provided to all councils, some may feel that they have no choice but to suspend all non-essential expenditure, hampering our national efforts to defeat the coronavirus and prepare for the economic recovery.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The big winners are smaller districts. Most will receive at least \u00a31m extra, the government said. They had been lobbying ministers hard for more funding, arguing that the wipeout of key income streams on which they are heavily reliant under lockdown, such as car parking and fees had left many districts close to bankruptcy.</p> \n  <p>Cllr John Fuller, chairman of the District Councils\u2019 Network, said: \u201cWe are pleased that government has listened to districts and acted on our call for vital extra funding so that we can continue to fight coronavirus, reduce homelessness, protect the vulnerable and collect waste.</p> \n  <p>English councils fear that a continuation of lockdown trends of soaring service cost and shrinking income will leave them with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/coronavirus-crisis-english-councils-funding-shortfall\">shortfall of at least \u00a35bn</a> for the year, and there are likely to be fresh calls for extra government cash.</p> \n  <p>The government said it has for the time being abandoned plans to implement a new \u201cfair funding\u201d formula to allocate annual grant funding for English councils.

No 10 was very keen to play down those suggestions, and today it is expected that his tone will be much more cautious, stressing the dangers of any significant move away from the restrictions currently in place.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8271289/Blueprint-work-PM-warns-wont-risk-second-wave-coronavirus.html?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&amp;utm_campaign=0ee8e24982-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_04_30_05_59&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_10959edeb5-0ee8e24982-189782117\">In the Daily Mail</a> <strong>Jason Groves</strong> quotes a Whitehall source using an interesting image to suggest that only modest changes are in the pipeline for next week. The source told him:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are looking at whether we can undo the top button and make things more comfortable in one or two places for the economy. But any idea of a widespread lifting is plain wrong.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/boris-has-found-a-path-out-of-lockdown-but-it-wont-be-smooth\">his column</a> in this week\u2019s Spectator, <strong>James Forsyth</strong> makes a similar prediction.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Next week\u2019s review of the lockdown will lead only to the mildest of easing. I am told that what relaxation there will be will mostly concern outdoor activities. (Though it is worth remembering that there is more flex in the current guidelines than is generally realised. Anyone can go to work, for instance, if they can\u2019t work from home.) Schools in England are likely not to return until after half-term. Next week\u2019s review will, according to one of those involved, be about a \u2018timeline for when we can do things\u2019 rather than an opportunity to do them straight away.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s interview last night (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/30/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-latest-updates?page=with:block-5eaa855b8f0882b206dcfced#block-5eaa855b8f0882b206dcfced\">9.53am)</a> may have constrained Johnson even further. Until now the four nations of the UK have (with minor exceptions) been adopting a joint approach to coronavirus, agreed at meetings of the emergency committee Cobra, at which the devolved administrations are represented. But Sturgeon has repeatedly said that Scotland would diverge from the UK approach if she thought that was justified. If she were to decide next week that any relaxation of the lockdown would be unacceptable (which is what she hinted last night), it would be risky for Johnson to set different rules for England. Perhaps he would get credit for opening up the economy, but if coronavirus infection rates were to start to soar again south of the border, he would be open to the charge of being reckless with people\u2019s lives.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T10:31:48.540Z\">at 11.31am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eaa9dc58f08b27d8fdd71be\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jamie-grierson\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T09:45:17.121Z\">10.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>More than 3,000 additional officers have joined police forces under the recruitment pledge that formed a centrepiece to Boris Johnson\u2019s election campaign, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/more-than-3000-extra-officers-join-police-in-recruitment-drive\">new figures have shown.</a></p> \n  <p>Johnson promised to recruit 20,000 officers during the summer 2019 election campaign, which many noted would in fact replace roughly the same number that had been lost under 10 years of Conservative party austerity.</p> \n  <p>The government set out its plans to recruit 20,000 additional officers by March 2023 in September and the Home Office on Thursday published the first official set of statistics on progress towards that number.</p> \n  <p>They show 3,005 recruits joined the police specifically as part of the uplift programme.

(Although today is the last day of April, the government has said we might have to wait until Saturday until we officially know whether or not the target has been hit, because it takes time to find out what has happened with home-testing kits.)</p> \n  <p>Here are some of the other lines from his interviews.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Buckland said that Nicola Sturgeon was right to warn that it might not be possible to lift any lockdown measures next week.</strong> The government has to review the lockdown measures by next Thursday, three weeks after the original measures were extended. In an interview on ITV\u2019s Peston programme last night Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, said that it might be impossible to relax any of the measures currently in place. She said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>People talk about lifting the lockdown - that is not going to be a flick of the switch moment, we\u2019re going to have to be very careful, very slow, very gradual. I\u2019m far from convinced at this stage that when we get to the next review point on the 7 May we\u2019ll be in a position to lift any of these measures right now, because the margins of manoeuvre that we\u2019re operating in right now are very, very, very tight and narrow.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked about her comment, Buckland said Sturgeon was \u201cright to be cautious\u201d. He went on:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think the common thread between the governments is one of extreme caution following the evidence of the Sage [Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies] committee, making sure that we don\u2019t do anything in a premature way that could risk a second spike. That would be a disaster.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He also said that, although a lot of work was going on in government on what might happen in the next phase, that did not mean there would be a sudden move towards relaxing the rules. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>That\u2019s, of course, not saying that we\u2019re suddenly going to move into a new phase - we need to be absolutely sure that the five tests that were set out some weeks ago are going to be met, and in particular the need to avoid that second or even third spike in the disease is clear to me both in terms of health and the well-being of the economy as well.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that he was considering legislating to reduce the number of jurors needed for trials.</strong> (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/30/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-latest-updates?page=with:block-5eaa86b18f0882b206dcfcf4#block-5eaa86b18f0882b206dcfcf4\">9.14am.)</a> But he also said that that would \u201ctake time\u201d and that he was looking at other measures that could be introduced to allow jurors to return to courts as early as next month.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said getting information about the number of coronavirus deaths in care homes was not straightforward, which was \u201cfrustrating\u201d for government.</strong> He explained:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s a lot more localised and it works through the local registration process, and that\u2019s frankly been frustrating because obviously we want that information as early as possible.</p> \n   <p>The fact is that the care sector is huge, many tens of thousands of different settings for people and the picture isn\u2019t going to emerge as quickly as it would do, say, in the hospital network in the UK.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a51f6fb651fb0f8558f07098b061b2bf7b0680d4\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a51f6fb651fb0f8558f07098b061b2bf7b0680d4/0_96_4029_2417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Buckland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Buckland.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Barcroft Media/Barcroft Media via Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T09:02:36.999Z\">at 10.02am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eaa8aaa8f0882b206dcfd18\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T08:24:19.301Z\">9.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Capt Tom Moore</strong>, who is celebrating his 100th birthday today (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/30/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-latest-updates?page=with:block-5eaa7da88f0874558631852b#block-5eaa7da88f0874558631852b\">8.32am)</a>, has now raised more than \u00a330m for NHS charities, according to<a href=\"https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/tomswalkforthenhs\"> the latest updates on his JustGiving page.</a></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eaa86b18f0882b206dcfcf4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/owenbowcott\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T08:14:26.857Z\">9.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Number of jurors hearing trials could be cut, lord chief justice suggests</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The number of jurors in trials could be reduced to enable courts to restart soon while observing social distancing, the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales has suggested.</p> \n  <p><strong>Lord Burnett of Maldon </strong>said the judiciary was also looking at whether larger venues, such as university lecture theatres, could be used to ensure jurors keep sufficiently apart from one another during the coronavirus outbreak.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI would support a move to reduce the number of jurors.

  "<p>Libya\u2019s internationally recognised government has said its forces will keep fighting, after a unilateral ceasefire declaration by its eastern-based opponents in the country\u2019s brutal civil war.</p> <p>The Government of National Accord (GNA), based in Tripoli, said it did not trust the Libyan National Army (LNA) of renegade general Khalifa Haftar.</p> <p>Late on Wednesday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/eastern-libyan-forces-have-agreed-a-ceasefire-during-ramadan\">a spokesman for Haftar said the LNA was adopting a ceasefire</a> for Islam\u2019s holy month of Ramadan in response to requests by the international community and \u201cfriendly countries\u201d.</p> <p>Libya has been split since 2014 between rival administrations in Tripoli and Benghazi. Haftar launched a war to capture Tripoli a year ago, advancing into the southern suburbs before his offensive stalled. His forces, backed by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia, have continually bombarded the capital.</p> <p>In recent weeks Haftar\u2019s forces have suffered a series of battlefield reverses during a surge in violence that has included indiscriminate shelling of clearly marked hospitals.</p> <p>On Monday he abruptly declared a popular mandate to take control of the whole country. The ceasefire offer suggests that he was told by his backers that he had overstepped the mark and needed to bow to international pressure for a lull in fighting if he was to recover lost diplomatic ground. He may also have reasoned that a ceasefire would give him time to reorganise his battered supply lines.</p> <p>Monday\u2019s political declaration was denounced by the US embassy in Libya and by the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, as well as indirectly criticised by France, one of Haftar\u2019s strongest covert backers.</p> <p>The declaration also implied that Haftar no longer recognised the authority of the elected house of representatives (HoR) in the eastern city of Tobruk, which he had been broadly allied with for many years.</p> <p>The head of the HoR, Ageela Saleh, had just put forward an eight-point political plan to try to reconcile the east of the country with the GNA.</p> <p>Haftar has presented himself to his overseas backers as the man to bring security to Libya and crush the Muslim Brotherhood. He has been either tolerated or supported by some countries as the legitimate representative of political forces in the east, but his apparent clash with Saleh, a leading political force in the east, made that claim less tenable.</p> <p>During the recent escalation in violence and attendant rise in civilian casualties, the LNA shelled a civilian hospital in Tareeq al-Shouq, destroying an intensive care unit. The hospital had been earmarked to take a leading role in the event of a coronavirus outbreak in Libya.</p> <p>The Dutch embassy in Libya said there had been 12 attacks on medical facilities since the beginning of the year and that the bulk had occurred in GNA-held areas \u2013 a diplomatic way of blaming the LNA.</p> <p>Some of the most intense recent fighting has been around Tarhuna, a town 40 miles south-east of Tripoli used as a platform for the LNA to supply its forces attacking the capital. Electricity has been cut off to Tarhuna for weeks, in retaliation for Hafta\u2019s forces temporarily stopping the gas supply to the Khoms power station (which also supplies Tarhuna). The World Health Organization in Libya had warned the fighting was impeding its work to prepare for a coronavirus outbreak</p> <p>The GNA, increasingly supported by Turkish drone strikes on LNA supply lines, has also widened its military counteroffensive, including by shelling the LNA\u2019s al-Watyia airbase, the main source of the air threat to civilians in Tripoli. Haftar had previously suffered reverses in a string of coastal towns close to the Tunisian border.</p> <p>He retains control of the main oilfields and his supporters have closed oil terminals, forcing a two-month shutdown of Libyan production, the country\u2019s economic lifeblood. </p> <p>Haftar had envisaged his Tripoli offensive as a lightning strike, but he quickly became bogged down south of the city.</p> <p>On Monday he dismissed the UN-brokered Skhirat <a href=\"https://unsmil.unmissions.org/sites/default/files/Libyan%20Political%20Agreement%20-%20ENG%20.pdf\">political agreement (pdf)</a>, laboriously negotiated in 2015, rejecting all the political institutions set up under it and in effect wiping the constitutional slate clean.</p> <p>The agreement, he said, had \u201cdestroyed\u201d the country, and the Libyan people had tasked the LNA general command with a \u201chistoric\u201d duty in such extraordinary times.</p> <p>Some analysts believe Haftar\u2019s rejection of all previous political agreements was in part a reaction to his recent military reverses. Tarek Megerisi, a Libya specialist at the European Council on Foreign Relations thinktank, said: \u201cThis move suggests an acknowledgement by Haftar that his attack on Tripoli is unsalvageable, so he is trying to consolidate his case before the ramifications of that failure lead to unmanageable unrest or attempts at an internal coup.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Many years before his death, I remember the writer John Bayley saying that while grieving the loss of his wife, Iris Murdoch, he spent a lot of time, in his head, in his childhood. It was clearly a pain reflex, a way of escaping the present into his most vivid memories and a sense of making time elastic. Trapped inside, going nuts, there aren\u2019t too many ways to get away at present, but revisiting long-distant comforts is one.</p> <p>The quickest way to do this is through food. Incidental data in the United States suggests that for the past two months, among the overall boom in grocery sales has been a spike in the consumption of comfort food. Sales of chocolate, ice-cream and popcorn are up, as well as expensive processed foods that, before the lockdown, might have been considered an unhealthy extravagance.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In recent weeks, TGI Friday's jalapeno poppers have become a staple in the weekly shop</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That\u2019s certainly the case in our house.

They work out, incredibly, at about 50 cents a mouthful \u2013 but in recent weeks, and in the absence of any other source of drive-by comfort, they\u2019ve become a staple in the weekly shop.</p> <p>My kids and I make endless bowls of strawberry jelly. We buy ice-cream cones and assemble teetering sundaes. It doesn\u2019t always work out. I got halfway through a plate of highly anticipated frozen buffalo wings, then had a mental flash of the chicken processing plant and couldn\u2019t finish them.</p> <p>On the other hand, I have never eaten more baked beans in my life \u2013 on potatoes, with eggs, even thrown into bolognese sauce, and always chased with a massive block of cheddar, a regression to the ultimate Beano version of kids\u2019 comfort.</p> <p>After dinner, at the end of another hard day of playing garbage games on their iPads, my kids are made to engage with one other major source of nostalgic comfort. If they come out of this period with one new skill, it won\u2019t be yoga (bitter laugh), chess or the rudiments of coding, but the words and music to the American musical songbook.</p> <p>On Monday night, we did My Fair Lady (the soundtrack to the original Broadway production, not the movie, obviously). \u201cSix feet distance!\u201d they screamed, before skipping around the living room to I Could Have Danced All Night and falling about laughing.

We are ready, at the level of the federation, to support them.\u201d<strong><br></strong><br>Another player, one of Haiti\u2019s rising stars who plays professionally, has claimed that a friend of Dadou tried to rape her when she was living at the centre, in a suburb of the country\u2019s capital, Port-au-Prince.</p> <p>\u201cShe managed to get away from him and her parents know the situation,\u201d said another source who is close to the player\u2019s family.<strong> </strong>\u201cBut Dadou has tried everything to keep it quiet.\u201d</p> <p>Another alleged victim said: \u201cI\u2019m so afraid. Dadou Jean-Bart is a very dangerous person. There are a lot of people who want to talk but they\u2019re so afraid, especially for the parents who are still in Haiti.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"27a27420477179a3ac16c539fb141b475205eb31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27a27420477179a3ac16c539fb141b475205eb31/0_198_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The national training centre at Croix-des-Bouquets, in a suburb of Haiti\u2019s capital, Port-au-Prince.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The national training centre at Croix-des-Bouquets, in a suburb of Haiti\u2019s capital, Port-au-Prince.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @cxdesbouquets/Twitter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In reply, Jean-Bart said: \u201cTo date, in women\u2019s football in Haiti, where there are generations of players who are now 50 or 60 years old, there has never been, to my knowledge, even suspicions of this kind. Personally I am and I have been a non-violent man. I don\u2019t understand how someone can make me look like an executioner to the point where families would feel intimidated by me.\u201d</p> <p>The FHF said that it took<strong> \u201c</strong>such serious allegations very seriously. To date, we have never received any complaints to this effect.\u201d</p> <p>It added: \u201cOur project is first of all a human project which aims to change the future of young people, to roll back the exclusion through play even if we know that in this country and even in the world some spirits are always at war against the beautiful and the good.\u201d</p> <p>Players usually move to the centre when they are teenagers, often rescued from a life on the streets. Funded by Fifa\u2019s \u201cGoal\u201d programme to support football development, the centre was described as an opportunity to \u201clevel the international playing field\u201d by the former Fifa vice-president Jack Warner when established in 2001. Haiti\u2019s men\u2019s team confounded expectations by reaching the semi-finals of last year\u2019s Concacaf Gold Cup, but several witnesses have alleged to the Guardian the facility is in a dilapidated state after years of neglect despite having received up to $6m from Fifa\u2019s \u201cForward\u201d programme since 2016.</p> <p>\u201cThe last time I set foot there, I wanted to vomit,\u201d said a coach who used to work there regularly. \u201cIt is despicable. Ten kids sleep in every room, there are no sheets, no clean toilets. It\u2019s unimaginable. Where did the money go? The federation received millions, and they didn\u2019t even buy sheets.\u201d<br><br>The coach added: \u201cThis centre is a nightmare. Fifa\u2019s inspectors came, we thought they were going to say something, but it didn\u2019t happen. It\u2019s impossible. How can they say nothing? The young people have no medical monitoring, they eat the same thing every day \u2013 rice, pasta, bananas, chicken \u2013 drink water that you wouldn\u2019t ever drink and in the meantime the FA officials have their own doctor and organise banquets. It is obscene.\u201d</p> <p>In response to the allegations of neglect, the FHF\u2019s statement provided a list of new facilities that have been built at the centre, including an air-conditioned apartment block for senior players.</p> <p>\u201cThese are modern and more than decent facilities and all our foreign visitors come out amazed by the beauty of the place and the efforts made by our young people and our managers to keep it very correct,\u201d it said. \u201cWe are making a lot of effort to increase the self-esteem of our young people and their supervisors, otherwise they would not have been able to achieve such beautiful feats in the face of the countries of America and the Caribbean, clothing and other needs all year round.\u201d<strong><br></strong><br>A Fifa spokesman said the FHF was asked about allegations of sexual abuse at the centre following questions by the Guardian. The Fifa spokesman said the questions were raised by a member of staff from the office of V\u00e9ron Mosengo-Omba, Fifa\u2019s chief member associations officer.</p> <p>\u201cFifa was in contact recently with the Haiti Football Association as part of a general round of contacts with Fifa\u2019s 211 member associations in relation to the current coronavirus pandemic,\u201d said the Fifa spokesman. \u201cThe purpose of the call was to inquire about the situation of Haitian football as a consequence of the pandemic. During the conversation, the Fifa representative raised concern about alleged sexual abuses in Haiti and pointed to the dedicated programme and toolkit for member associations \u2013 Fifa Guardians \u2013 designed to enhance child safeguarding standards within football.\u201d<br><br>Jean-Bart received a message of congratulations from Fifa\u2019s president, Gianni Infantino, when re-elected as president of the FHF for the sixth time in February.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fifa told the Guardian the FHF had yet to fall in line with its statutes which recommend federation presidents serve a maximum of three terms. \u201cAs is currently the case with member associations in other regions around the world, Fifa is in contact with the FHF with a view to review their statutes and incorporating inter-alia good governance standards, including term-limits.\u201d<br><br>In response to the allegations of neglect and misuse of funds at the centre, Fifa told the Guardian it is \u201cin discussion with the FHF about the improvements being made at the technical centre. In particular, we have noted that overall conditions and facilities at the centre have improved as a result of funding provided through the Fifa Forward programme and will continue to work with the FHF to ensure the right conditions and football infrastructure are provided for players at the centre.</p> <p>\u201cFifa has put in place several measures to monitor and oversee the proper use of funds by confederations and member associations.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>There was a<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mettefrederiksen.dk/videos/2629150217332069/?v=2629150217332069\"> nice Facebook post</a> in early April by the Danish prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/11/denmark-election-matte-frederiksen-leftwing-immigration\">Mette Frede</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/11/denmark-election-matte-frederiksen-leftwing-immigration\">riksen</a>. In it, she is doing the washing up while singing along to a hit by the 80s Danish popsters Dodo and the Dodos during her country\u2019s weekly TV lockdown singalong.</p> <p>Frederiksen is having a good crisis \u2013 not just the kitchen karaoke, but in acting quickly and clearly to shut down the country, limiting deaths, at the time of writing, to 443. Compare that with neighbouring Sweden, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/dont-judge-swedens-light-touch-on-covid-19-yet-says-minister\">which has taken a </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/dont-judge-swedens-light-touch-on-covid-19-yet-says-minister\">less stringent approach</a> and where there have been 2,462 deaths. There are obviously loads of factors involved, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/why-do-female-leaders-seem-to-be-more-successful-at-managing-the-coronavirus-crisis\">could it have something to do with the fact that Frede</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/why-do-female-leaders-seem-to-be-more-successful-at-managing-the-coronavirus-crisis\">riksen is a woman</a>?</p> <p>Denmark does a good female prime minister \u2013 or <em>statsminister</em>, as you will know if you have watched Borgen. Birgitte Nyborg, the character at the centre of the political drama, is said to be influenced not by Frederiksen, but by the only other woman to lead the country, Helle Thorning-Schmidt. Still, that Facebook post was very Borgen. (Borgen, which means castle, is what the Danes call their parliament.)</p> <p>The news that Netflix has bought the rights to the series \u2013 and will reunite the cast and crew, along with Adam Price, the show\u2019s creator, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/29/borgen-to-return-with-new-series-on-netflix\">to make a </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/29/borgen-to-return-with-new-series-on-netflix\">fourth season</a> \u2013 should provide some much-needed cheer. You could argue it was an unlikely hit. When it came to Britain in 2012, we already knew, thanks to Forbrydelsen (The Killing), that DR, the Danish national broadcaster, did gripping character-based drama. But that show had mysterious murder at its heart, plus an enigmatic and undeniably hot cop <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2012/sep/17/sarah-lund-jumper-final-killing\">who wore appealing knitwear</a>. Political nitty-gritty, though, in a little country more famous for pastries and Lego? It is hard enough to get excited about our own politics, never mind others\u2019 that require subtitles.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/29/borgen-to-return-with-new-series-on-netflix\">Borgen to return with new series on Netflix</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Borgen is more than intricate political drama, though: it is intimate drama, politics made human. It is about democracy and people: relationships between people, the relationship between work and home (especially interesting at the moment). It is about journalism, women, values, having children, not having children. It is about you and me.</p> <p>Nyborg (played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/feb/01/sidse-babett-knudsen-borgens-appeal\">Sidse Babett Knudsen</a>) is a fabulous character: strong, ambitious, confident, but also genuine and honest. She has a three-dimensional home life, a hot husband and she rides a bicycle \u2013 of course.</p> <p>A lot of real people could learn a lesson from Nyborg and Borgen. Politicians \u2013 I am looking at you, the cabinet \u2013 could learn that ambition and power don\u2019t preclude honesty and ideology. Spin doctors (<em>spindoktorer</em>), press officers, political editors and journalists might learn something about how to get more people to engage with and trust in politics. When Borgen aired in the UK, the Tory/Lib Dem coalition was in power; I remember caring more for and about Nyborg \u2013 and Katrine the TV news reporter and Kasper the spin doctor \u2013 than I did for David Cameron, Nick bloody Clegg and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/21/how-steve-hilton-turned-on-his-friend-and-ex-boss-david-cameron\">Steve frigging Hilton</a>.</p> <p>The new series won\u2019t be around until 2022 (boo), but Netflix is going to put up the existing episodes some time this year. Soon, let\u2019s hope \u2013 it is ideal lockdown fare. If you haven\u2019t seen it, you need to get involved; if you have, you will almost certainly want to again. You will find the cast infinitely more palatable than Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, Priti Patel, Matt Hancock and Dominics Raab and Cummings. You would definitely want Nyborg at the helm right now. Or Frederiksen, or Thorning-Schmidt (who is married to Stephen Kinnock, of course, although that is by the by). I would take any Danish woman, frankly.</p> <p>Denmark is clearly a better place to be: because you are less likely to die there at the moment; because singing 80s pop songs together sounds like (even) more fun than collectively clapping and banging saucepans; because Borgen.</p>",
  "<h2>20. Beauty and the Beast (2017)</h2> <p>Stanley Tucci plays Maestro Cadenza in this recent version of Beauty and the Beast, a florid and neurotic musical star who, at the beginning of the film, is transformed into a harpsichord, while his wife, played by Audra McDonald, is mortifyingly turned into a wardrobe. A cartoony cameo-sketch playing on Tucci\u2019s gift for uptight, diva-ish roles.</p> <h2>19. The Road to Perdition (2002)</h2> <p>A classic, and perhaps rather basic supporting character turn for Tucci, the sort of unpromising role that he invests with authority. In Sam Mendes\u2019s 30s mob drama, he plays Frank Nitti, the Chicago wiseguy who has to reject an overture from Mafia footsoldier Mike Sullivan, played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/26/tom-hanks-25-best-performances-ranked\">Tom Hanks</a>. A solid, but unremarkable Tucci turn.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/23/stanley-tucci-negroni-video\">Why is Stanley Tucci making a negroni so hot? I decided to investigate</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>18. A Modern Affair (1995)</h2> <p>A very rare example of Tucci getting an alpha-romantic lead role, in which his iconic baldness signifies old-school virility. He plays the philandering photographer who has donated sperm to a fertility lab, and then finds himself being (illegally) tracked down by the woman (Lisa Eichhorn) who has got pregnant by his seed and now wants to have a real relationship with the father of her child \u2013 to his bemused dismay.</p> <h2>17. Swing Vote (2008)</h2> <p>Here is Tucci in pure comic cynical-bad-guy role, the sort of thing that has been his bread and butter during his career, although he can do so much more. He plays the ruthless campaign manager of a US presidential candidate, played by Kelsey Grammer, who is horrified to learn that the poll is so close that it hinges on just one guy: an amiably clueless good ol\u2019 boy, played by Kevin Costner, who isn\u2019t sure how he\u2019s going to vote. And so Costner\u2019s innocence comes up against Tucci\u2019s reptilian corruption. Some nice lines for Stanley.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"96b908c548625fafdb89f2ff17ff640b5eae29f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96b908c548625fafdb89f2ff17ff640b5eae29f8/0_2_2892_1735/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stanley Tucci as the Duc d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans in A Little Chaos\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Period piece: as the Duc d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans in A Little Chaos.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/BBC Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>16. A Little Chaos (2014)</h2> <p>Tucci roles divide into wig and non-wig and this, with Alan Rickman directing, is very much the first category. He is Philippe, Duc d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans, the roguish brother of Louis XIV (played by Rickman himself), who wears a long flowing tonsorial creation under a similarly lavish hat. He also has a playful quasi-Brit accent to emphasise how louche and racy he is supposed to be, exchanging waspish badinage with everyone at court.</p> <h2>15. The Hunger Games (2012)</h2> <p>There have been some jaw-dropping wig roles for Tucci in his career, and this has to be the most outrageous, which also foregrounds his gift for the menacing and sinister. In The Hunger Games, he plays Caesar Flickerman, the smoothie blue-haired TV celebrity whose job is to interview the gladiatorial contestants (such as Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s Katniss Everdeen) before they go out to face certain death. His creepy blue wig is complemented by fake teeth.</p> <h2>14. Julie &amp; Julia (2009)</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jun/27/nora-ephron\">Nora Ephron</a>\u2019s film is the second (and less successful) pairing of Tucci with Meryl Streep. Here he plays Paul Child, a smart, discreet and very masculine character who is a US diplomat in Paris in the 1950s, married to the eccentric and forceful Julia Child, played, of course, by Streep. He is gently tolerant and affectionate about her search for a real pastime. When she becomes a star of cooking, he must take a back seat that\u2019s even further back. Tucci handles this supporting role with gallantry and aplomb.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"74ffafbf6e283445e22b16dcb4ec67939ec171d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74ffafbf6e283445e22b16dcb4ec67939ec171d9/0_137_1600_1990/804.jpg\" alt=\"Stanley Tucci with Meryl Streep in Julie & Julia\" width=\"804\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As Paul Child with Meryl Streep as Julia in Julie &amp; Julia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Columbia Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>13. Monkey Shines (1988)</h2> <p>George A Romero\u2019s horror classic gives Tucci a juicy but small villainous role. He plays Dr John Wiseman, the obnoxious, incompetent and philandering surgeon whose mistakes cause a law student to become paralysed. And when this man gets a trained monkey to help him with his daily tasks, he finds that this monkey can carry out acts of revenge, which is bad news for Dr Wiseman.</p> <h2>12. Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)</h2> <p>So many actors find that superhero roles are a career must, and perhaps Tucci will one day play a great supervillain. However, he had another potent supporting role in this MCU adventure, laying out the origin of Steve Rogers\u2019s Captain America. He is Dr Abraham Erskine, a mysterious German scientist at a military recruiting station \u2013 and a refugee from the Nazis \u2013 who spots Steve and sees the potential in him.</p> <h2>11. Submission (2017)</h2> <p>Here is another of the louche, sexually calculating and slightly smug roles that Tucci knows so well how to play, bringing something unexpectedly sympathetic to the table \u2013 and it\u2019s one of his rare lead roles. Tucci is the creative writing professor and failed novelist who is appallingly and humiliatingly attracted to a student, who submits to him \u2013 and there, incidentally, is the title pun \u2013 the first chapter of a novel she is writing. The chaotic sex scene is rich in disaster for this conceited middle-aged male.</p> <h2>10. Deconstructing Harry (1997)</h2> <p>Perhaps it was always Tucci\u2019s destiny to play the quasi-Woody Allen character in a Woody Allen film, but he does it without an out-and-out impersonation, probably because Allen himself is in the picture. Tucci plays the writer Paul Epstein, who is, in fact, a character who has sprung from the mind of writer Harry Block (played by Allen) and clearly a cipher for Harry. Tucci has some nice scenes opposite Demi Moore, who plays his former therapist, now wife, who becomes an increasingly devout in her Judaism \u2013 although, again, Tucci is a little upstaged.</p> <h2>9. Spotlight (2015)</h2> <p>Here is another type of role that Tucci was born to play \u2013 the tough, overworked, slightly eccentric lawyer who takes on pro bono work to fight for the underdog; his hairpiece here has something frizzy, wiry and greying. Tucci plays the real-life attorney Mitchell Garabedian, who represented people who were abused as children by Catholic priests in Boston but then found powerful vested interests associated with the church were closing ranks against him. The press, in the form of Mark Ruffalo, ride to his assistance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8ce094c1600f3e214393e425e67bd07e1458703e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ce094c1600f3e214393e425e67bd07e1458703e/2_0_1690_1014/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stanley Tucci stars alongside Emma Thompson in The Children Act\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A smart pairing: Tucci stars alongside Emma Thompson in The Children Act.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/BBC Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>8. The Children Act (2017)</h2> <p>Tucci and Emma Thompson is a smart pairing, so much so that it is a surprise that they haven\u2019t worked together more often. Here, he plays Jack, an academic, who is discontented with his marriage to Fiona, a workaholic high court judge, played by Thompson. Depressed by the declining intimacy in their marriage, but declaring his intention to be honest, he tells her he is thinking of having an affair \u2013 if that\u2019s all right with her. It\u2019s a strange, complex role: sympathetic in a way, but asking your wife\u2019s permission for an affair is curious. Tucci carries the contradictions well.</p> <h2>7. Easy A (2010)</h2> <p>Here is the kind of seductive, persuasive, humorous supporting performance that is a keynote of Tucci\u2019s career. In this comedy inspired by Nathaniel Hawthorne\u2019s novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/06/scarlet-letter-nathaniel-hawthorne-100-best-novels\">The Scarlet Letter</a>, Tucci plays Dill, the liberal, understanding father of a high-school student, Olive (played by Emma Stone), and married to Rosemary (played by Patricia Clarkson). As the parents, the two have a lovely chemistry. It is when Olive becomes the centre of gossip at her school that her parents (chiefly her mum) have to take an interest. Tucci and Clarkson have great family scenes in the kitchen and it\u2019s entirely plausible that smart, funny Tucci is Emma Stone\u2019s dad.</p> <h2>6. Margin Call (2011)</h2> <p>This JC Chandor drama about the 2008 financial crash features Tucci as Eric Dale, the head of risk analysis at an investment bank who is laid off at the very beginning of the film. The humiliation of a proud, difficult man is well conveyed by Tucci. But his character is in possession of a terrible secret that had been revealed by the research he had been doing: the bank is horribly overextended in its investment positions and could collapse at any moment. Eric is now caught between still wanting to warn people inside the firm, and being quite content to let the whole thing go.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"942f6eac797d368c43d2dc5bf882d7752ae22616\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/942f6eac797d368c43d2dc5bf882d7752ae22616/0_51_2465_1479/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stanley Tucci as Puck with Rupert Everett as Oberon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mischievous: Tucci as Puck with Rupert Everett as Oberon in A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>5. A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream (1999)</h2> <p>Tucci fans are crying out for the great man to be given a big Shakespearian role on screen: something like Claudius in Hamlet or maybe Brutus or Coriolanus from the Roman plays. Puck in A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream is a nice role for Tucci nevertheless. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,85170,00.html\">At the time</a>, I thought Michael Hofmann\u2019s version of the play, starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Rupert Everett as Titania and Oberon with Kevin Kline as Bottom, was a bit chocolate boxy, but it has a charm that I perhaps overlooked. Puck is a relatively innocuous figure in the film, and Tucci plays him as something like a Martian, but with tiny horns. Of course, Tucci has always been a Puckish figure in films generally, someone with a propensity for mischief.</p> <h2>4. Shall We Dance (2004)</h2> <p>Here is one of the outrageous Tucci comedy extravaganzas, one of the few films that really taps into his gift for broad humour, his physicality, and indeed makes a comic point about his legendary baldness. Tucci plays Link, the office colleague and pal of Bobby, played by Richard Gere. When Bobby signs up for ballroom dance lessons because he is in love with a woman there (Jennifer Lopez), he discovers to his astonishment that Link is a secret ballroom enthusiast and there is an amazing dance-contest scene in which Link throws away an absurd wig and, reinvigorated by his public baldness, dances a spectacular cha-cha-cha and pasodoble. The scene is cleverly shot to flatter Tucci\u2019s dancing skills and his lean frame looks good in his figure-hugging catsuit with flame motif.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"05b7fd135c5f2eeac1de8175c124d11995b7ea3a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05b7fd135c5f2eeac1de8175c124d11995b7ea3a/110_0_1928_1157/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stanley Tucci as the serial killer George Harvey in The Lovely Bones\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Creepy: Tucci as the serial killer George Harvey in The Lovely Bones.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Dreamworks SKG</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>3. The Lovely Bones (2009)</h2> <p>Throughout his film career, Tucci has kept really villainous typecasting at a careful arm\u2019s length, although on TV he notably played the creepy and possibly murderous philanthropist Richard Cross in Steven Bochco\u2019s pioneering long-form TV drama Murder One and got a Golden Globe for playing the Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in the TV movie <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/recommends/watch/conspiracy-a-withering-study-of-nazis-in-a-room\">Conspiracy</a>. In Peter Jackson\u2019s movie version of Alice Sebold\u2019s novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/aug/11/fiction.features2\">The Lovely Bones</a> he plays a serial killer \u2013 the murderer responsible for the death of Saoirse Ronan\u2019s character, with whom he has an excruciating, all-but-unwatchable scene as he lures the innocent young girl into his lair. This is the performance that got Tucci his Academy Award nomination and perhaps it is precisely because Tucci always manages to get humanity and charm into his \u201cbad guy\u201d performances that he is a good fit with this role. His murderer is not just a cartoon sweaty creep but someone who could, however briefly and unconvincingly, convey something sufficiently amiable or avuncular to get away with his monstrous murders.</p> <h2>2. The Devil Wears Prada (2006)</h2> <p>For many, this will always be the classic Tucci performance: at the age of 46, he nailed a glorious comic role that won the hearts of audiences young and old, male and female. He plays Nigel Kipling, the fastidious, quick-tempered, but warm-hearted art director who works at the super-prestigious Manhattan fashion bible Runway, effectively a lieutenant to Runway\u2019s terrifying editor Miranda Priestly, played by Meryl Streep. (The story was based on Anna Wintour at Vogue.) It is Nigel who has to explain the workings of the magazine to the wide-eyed newbie played by Anne Hathaway, and he appears to be the only person who is not totally terrified of Miranda. With marvellous brio and technique, Tucci shows us who Nigel is \u2013 the smalltown boy who idolised fashion at a young age and, for all his airy sophistication, is still thrilled, every day, to be working at Runway. But he is also the vulnerable, lonely man who is deeply hurt when Miranda appears to be grooming him for a top job only to take it away from him at the last moment for her own machiavellian reasons. A Tuccissimo film.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f50af4d34309b5844e3781a21834fa9e628688b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f50af4d34309b5844e3781a21834fa9e628688b7/0_36_1746_1048/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stanley Tucci with Tony Shalhoub in Big Night\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Primo e Secondo: Tucci (right) with Tony Shalhoub in the foodie magnum opus Big Night.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Samuel Goldwyn Company</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>1. Big Night (1996)</h2> <p>The whole online world is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/23/stanley-tucci-negroni-video\">thrilling to Stanley Tucci\u2019s lockdown videos showing how to make perfect cocktails</a> \u2013 but he has always had a certain theatrical savoir faire around a kitchen. And this foodie film has to be his magnum opus, the passion project he co-wrote and also co-directed with Campbell Scott, a longtime friend and colleague. Tucci himself starred with Tony Shalhoub (another close friend) playing two Italian immigrant brothers, called respectively Secondo and Primo, in New Jersey in the 1950s, who jointly run a restaurant called Paradise. Primo is the head chef and Secondo is the manager, and it is Secondo\u2019s unhappy responsibility to deal with the clientele who are a little baffled and intimidated by Primo\u2019s fiercely purist attitude to the authentic Italian dishes he is serving. Secondo figures they should be serving safer and more Americanised dishes as their competition do, and when a rival restaurateur kindly offers to set up a special promotional \u201cbig night\u201d at Paradise featuring a visiting celebrity singer, Secondo jumps at the chance, little guessing that this man might have his own ulterior motive. It\u2019s a big, generous, passionate role for Tucci, who sparks off Shalhoub well. He has a part hairpiece, indicating receding rather than a vanishing hairline, and we are allowed to see Tucci as a younger man: more idealistic, more vulnerable and even more boyish.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 7 May 2020 to correct the spelling of George A Romero.</p>",
  "<p>Border Force officials carrying out passport and customs checks are being prevented from wearing face masks at work, staff claim, leaving them fearful that they must choose between their health or being disciplined.</p> <p>An order prohibiting officials from routinely wearing masks is said to have been given on 20 April. Some local managers had until then allowed staff to bring in and use their own protection.</p> <p>Two Border Force officials have died after contracting coronavirus in recent weeks.</p> <p>Only staff dealing with people who show symptoms of the virus or searching those clandestinely entering the country are provided with face masks.</p> <p>Managers have been told to ask staff to remove their masks in any other work situation, the Guardian understands. The Home Office did not deny the claim when it was put to a spokesman.</p> <p>The Immigration Services Union, representing officials working in the UK, Paris, Brussels, Lille, Calais, Dunkirk, Coquelles and Amsterdam, has advised its members to defy the Home Office, to which the Border Force answers. The force operates at air and sea ports and Eurotunnel and Eurostar junctions.</p> <p>In a circular sent to members on 25 April, the union writes: \u201cWe know many of you feel strongly that you should be able to wear face masks routinely at work in order to protect yourself and others from Covid-19 infections. We are therefore very worried that Border Force are preventing you from wearing your own face masks at work and in places threatening you with disciplinary action if you do try to wear a mask.</p> <p>\u201cTo say the least, this seems to us an aggressive and unreasonable attitude to take towards staff with genuine welfare concerns.\u201d</p> <p>The union says it will support members who face issues with managers for wearing masks and \u201cwill not hesitate to bring employment tribunal actions\u201d.</p> <p>It adds: \u201cWe do think it would be better for the Home Office to make standard provision for all, of course. However, they show no signs of doing this and we cannot ask members who are now anxious to wait for government procurement. If members have masks and wish to wear them, then they should. People should not be prevented from protecting themselves and others.\u201d</p> <p>The union says the Employments Rights Act gives officials the right to protect themselves at work. \u201cTherefore if you are persuaded on the balance of the scientific/public health evidence that you should bring a face mask to work and wear it, then you should do just that. We wish we could reassure that you will not face resistance from senior Border Force leaders. But we cannot.\u201d</p> <p>UK government sources said staff bringing in masks to work would not face disciplinary action but managers would explain the current scientific advice to those concerned by the policy. Public Health England (PHE) currently recommends face masks for the NHS and in social care settings but does not advise healthy people to wear them outside.</p> <p>This week, Scotland\u2019s first minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nicola-sturgeon\">Nicola Sturgeon</a>, announced new guidance recommending that the Scottish public should wear face masks in enclosed spaces where physical distancing was difficult to achieve, for example while shopping or using public transport.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus-key-workers\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus-key-workers&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus-key-workers&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The British Medical Association has called on ministers to make wearing masks in public compulsory. Critics have accused the government of being slow to roll out the general use of masks for fear of exacerbating a shortage in the healthcare system.</p> <p>The union has raised the issue of a lack of protective equipment for Border Force staff with the home affairs select committee, which is preparing to hold a short inquiry into the government\u2019s pandemic preparedness.</p> <p>A Home Office spokesman said: \u201cThe safety of the public and our staff is of the utmost importance. All guidance to staff on the use of personal protective equipment is based upon Public Health England\u2019s guidance. All Border Force staff have all the necessary protective clothing and equipment available as per the PHE guidance for when they are in close contact with anyone displaying symptoms.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>A woman in Texas was isolating with her family.

As Covid-19 spread ferociously in the US in March and April, federal court rulings restored, then abolished, abortion access multiple times, sometimes just hours apart.</p> <p>On 23 March, the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, issued an <a href=\"https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/health-care-professionals-and-facilities-including-abortion-providers-must-immediately-stop-all\">executive order</a> halting all elective surgical procedures, specifically calling out abortion. Abortion providers sued on 25 March, a federal court agreed with them and blocked the state\u2019s order on 30 March.</p> <p>But the reprieve lasted only 21 hours. The fifth circuit court of appeals in New Orleans, Louisiana, reinstated Texas\u2019s executive order on 31 March. The court\u2019s bench is arguably the most conservative in the nation, and is outwardly hostile to abortion rights.</p> <p>\u201cThey were open one day, and they were closed the next day, and they were allowed to do medication abortions one day, and not the next day,\u201d said Nikiya Natale, statewide manager of the Texas Equal Access Fund, which helps women pay for abortions.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had to cancel hundreds of appointments \u2026 and numerous times,\u201d said Amy Hagstrom Miller, founder and CEO of Whole Woman\u2019s Health, which operates clinics in Texas and four other states.

She was in disbelief when both failed. \u201cI feel science failed me,\u201d she told the court.</p> <p>When she tried to obtain an abortion, arguments were already under way in court.

Instead, Trump\u2019s Osha has merely issued a \u201cguidance\u201d, which is essentially a will-you-pretty-please-do-this request that meatpacking plants take sundry steps to improve safety. Considering that more than 700 workers at the Smithfield pork processing plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, have contracted Covid-19, it\u2019s hard to have confidence that meatpacking companies \u2013 which have already done such a poor job protecting their workers from the virus and which traditionally put huge emphasis on line speed and productivity \u2013 will rush to take the voluntary steps recommended to assure worker safety, steps that would cost money and slow down the plants\u2019 all-important line speed.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a guideline. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/business/economy/trump-meat-food-supply.html?action=click&amp;module=Spotlight&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">It\u2019s not a regulation.

Twenty-two meat and poultry plants have been shut at some point in recent weeks after clusters of employees tested positive.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The workers are forgotten, invisible cogs in Trump\u2019s political machinations</p> </blockquote> </aside> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/29/trump-coronavirus-america-richard-wolffe\">Trump the commander-in-bleach has been stripped of all feeling | Richard Wolffe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The language of Trump\u2019s executive order is startling \u2013 it treats workers and worker health as an afterthought. It\u2019s all about production; the workers are forgotten, invisible cogs in Trump\u2019s political machinations. In his executive order he declares: \u201cIt is important that processors of beef, pork, and poultry in the food supply chain continue operating and fulfilling orders to ensure a continued supply of protein for Americans.\u201d</p> <p>It would have been nice if Trump had flown out to Iowa, Nebraska or South Dakota to meet with workers and explained the situation before making an announcement that could ultimately threaten the lives of thousands of meatpacking workers. That\u2019s what a president who truly cared about workers would have done. But that\u2019s not how Trump rolls.</p> <p>And even less would Trump would have wanted to be seen standing alongside meatpacking workers since such a high percentage of them are immigrants, often brown people from south of the border or black people from east Africa \u2013 people whom Trump has made his whipping boy. Trump doesn\u2019t mind using these workers as production fodder so long as it keeps meat on America\u2019s table. A shortage of meat \u2013 an all-American symbol and a macho symbol \u2013 could make Trump look bumbling and incompetent and serve as yet another reason for Americans to vote against him in November.</p> <p>Who ever imagined that putting sirloin and filet mignon on your table would be a national defense issue? Trump evidently did, because he invoked the Defense Production Act to order meat plants reopened. When past presidents invoked the Defense Production Act, it was usually to order corporations to do what they don\u2019t want to do \u2013 to rush to produce this item or that one. But here Trump has invoked the act to do what many corporations want \u2013 to have their plants reopened despite the safety worries of all those irritating governors and mayors and labor unions and workers.</p> <p>Perversely, the Trump White House is pushing hard to give meatpacking companies, and all of corporate America, a disincentive to act quickly and properly to protect their workers against the pandemic. Trump\u2019s administration is pressing Congress to enact an extraordinary liability shield that would insulate corporations from lawsuits their workers bring asserting that their employers were negligent in doing too little to protect them against Covid-19.</p> <p>If you\u2019re going to force plants to reopen and in effect force wary employees back to work \u2013 they\u2019ll lose their unemployment benefits if they don\u2019t go back to work at their reopened plants \u2013 shouldn\u2019t you have some weapon, whether an emergency Osha regulation or the threat of a lawsuit to ensure that corporations step up and do what they should do on safety during the worst pandemic in a century?</p> <p>It\u2019s also rather shocking that Trump, in this executive order, does this big favor for American consumers, farmers and corporations and does nothing to thank the workers whose lives would be put on the line. At a minimum, Trump should demand that the meatpacking companies or Congress ensure that these workers receive substantial hazard pay for work he has deemed essential to the national defense. (<a href=\"https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/04/sherrod-brown-wants-essential-workers-to-get-up-to-25000-in-hazard-pay-during-coronavirus-pandemic.html\">Sherrod Brown has proposed a hazard pay premium</a> of $13 an hour for essential workers.)</p> <p>Chalk this up as yet another Trump administration win for corporate America and yet another loss for America\u2019s workers.</p>",

restaurants closed.</p> \n  <p>Myer had a 170.9 per cent year-on-year rise in entertainment sales driven by cooking appliances, with some of the best performing products being coffee machines and mixers.</p> \n  <p>Coles has seen a rise in purchases of vegetable, such potatoes, onions and carrots, while larger volumes of broccoli, lettuce and cabbage are being grown.</p> \n  <p>Woolworths said after disinfectants, bread mix was the second most popular purchase, with demand growing by 88 per cent between March 18 and April 14.</p> \n  <p>The supermarket chain also saw sales of dried herbs and spices rise by more than 70 per cent, dried soup mixes more than doubling.</p> \n  <p>And Woolworths recorded a 1,000 per cent rise in demand for hand sanitiser compared with this time last

I hope, however, that this will also be an opportunity to bring to the forefront the extreme issues that are confronting us through the combination of the catastrophic bushfires and now the COVID-19 situation. In this way I hope Eden Monaro will get the extra attention it needs and deserves right now. <br></p> \n  <p>The electorate office staff will remain in place to support all those who need help, through to the declaration of the by-election poll.<br></p> \n  <p>I want to take this opportunity to thank the people of Eden-Monaro for allowing me to serve them throughout my time as Member.

They played <strong>I Follow Rivers</strong> by Lykke Li (Magician Remix) regularly, and something about the hedonistic, urgent nature of it seemed to sit perfectly with the utter freedom and joy I felt during this time.

Wandering the cobbled, dusty streets soaking up the atmosphere, making sure every evening to sing and dance up at the fortress for the incredible sunsets, even getting the locals involved.

There was a record player and one record \u2013 Michel Delpech\u2019s <strong>Pour Un Flirt</strong> from 1971. Candles and lanterns, swimwear, flip flops, wine and baguettes.

Every time someone connected to the aux, they would cue up Girls\u2019 2010 release, Album. <strong>Lust for Life</strong> was the first track, and we never got any further. Christopher Owen\u2019s lyrics of bonfires, pizzas, and bottles of wine practically dictated our every move. It allowed us to get that cinematic young California summer, a last teenage hurrah for the ages.</p> <h2>A revolutionary interlude, Tuscany</h2> <p>Sorry, no beaches or bikinis in this memory. Castelnuovo di Garfagnana is in the rarely visited far north of Tuscany, on the edges of the Apennines. This is not Chiantishire; it\u2019s a working-class, staunchly socialist, agricultural region. As I stood in the doorway of the <a href=\"vecchiomulino.info\">Osteria Vecchio Mulino</a>, where you order platters of superb salumi or cheeses accompanied by Tuscan wines at off-licence prices, an old man in a black beret played some opening notes on his guitar.

It\u2019s theme is the spring kite festival called Basant, which is celebrated across the northern subcontinent. The music video \u2013 shot in my hometown Lahore, Pakistan \u2013 is quaint, nostalgic and wholesome, a reminder of bygone Basants spent on the rooftops of the old walled city, flying kites to this song. Basant and kite-flying in general were banned in Lahore in 2005 as a precautionary measure to prevent injuries/deaths related to the kite string, which is often covered in chemicals. Every spring brings fruitless talks of regulating manufacturers or easing restrictions, so this song and its memories stand in place.<br><strong>Mahnoor Bari</strong></p> <h2>To north Wales and back with a supergroup</h2> <p>The album of 1989 was <strong>The Travelling Wilburys Vol 1</strong>. We played it on a cassette player all the way from London to North Wales, on every journey we made and all the way home. By the end of the week we knew all of the lyrics and belted them out, often out of key but always joyously. It was my first holiday with my partner and his three children so it was a potentially fraught with problems but we searched rock pools, built sand castles and lost our kite and had a wonderful time. Three decades on we are a close and loving blended family and the album\u2019s penultimate song Tweeter and the Monkeyman still reminds me of the week we began to become that family. <br><strong>Elle</strong></p> <h2>Glory and trumpets, Vend\u00e9e</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78f62b4a22d94d8090064e6deb047c400fcfb436\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78f62b4a22d94d8090064e6deb047c400fcfb436/0_60_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"William Christie and musicians in his garden at Thir\u00e9 in the Vend\u00e9e.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">William Christie and musicians in his garden at Thir\u00e9 in the Vend\u00e9e.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julien Gazeau</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tenors Reinoud Van Mechelen and Paul Agnew sang Purcell\u2019s <strong>Sound the Trumpet</strong> in William Christie\u2019s extensive garden in the Vend\u00e9e, north of La Rochelle, on a glorious late-summer day.

Hopeman is a small fishing village on the Moray Firth coast in the north-east of Scotland with two beaches, east and west. Our favourite was the silvery east beach with the distinctive Daisy Rock, where the midsummer sun was said to set between it and her sister rock.

It was a staple of our strategy,\u201d said Mac Stipanovich, a retired Florida Republican political operative, said of past campaigns. \u201cRepublicans probably ought not to be complaining about it.\u201d</p> <p>Even as Republican operatives are seeking <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/28/2020-vote-by-mail-battle-heats-up-213920\">to scale up</a> their vote-by-mail operations, congressional Republicans have staunchly opposed efforts in coronavirus stimulus bills that would make it easier to vote.

So far, the parties have agreed on allocating <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/us/coronavirus-voting-stimulus.html\">$400m</a> to states to help them prepare for elections, a fraction of the minimum $4bn <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/estimated-costs-covid-19-election-resiliency-measures\">experts say</a> is needed.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really disappointing that our political leaders aren\u2019t all working to ensure that every eligible American is able to cast a ballot that will count,\u201d said Myrna P\u00e9rez, director of the voting rights and elections program at the Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cThere used to be a point in time where having free and fair access to the ballot was a bipartisan issue.\u201d</p> <p>Currently, <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/all-mail-elections.aspx\">five US states</a> conduct their elections entirely by mail, while access to mail-in balloting varies widely in others. To run an election that relies heavily on vote by mail would require investing millions of dollars in ballots, staffing, new technology and messaging,<a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/estimated-costs-covid-19-election-resiliency-measures\"> according to</a> the Brennan Center.</p> <p>In Orange county, California, switching to vote by mail took three or four years of planning and cost at least $3m, said Neal Kelley, the county\u2019s registrar of voters. In Washington state, it took five years to transition to an all vote-by-mail system. Most US election offices \u2013 some with just one or two full-time employees \u2013 do not have the resources to make this transition in time for November without support.</p> <p>\u201cThe clock is ticking,\u201d said Amber McReynolds, the chief executive of the National Vote at Home Institute and Coalition, which advocates for vote by mail.</p> <p>In recent weeks, Democrats and voting groups have filed a slew of lawsuits \u2013 taking aim at restrictive state laws that require voters to give an excuse to vote by mail or have an in-person witness for their ballots. Advocates also want states to pick up the cost of postage on mail-in ballots and registration forms, calling it an unconstitutional poll tax.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There used to be a point in time where having free and fair access to the ballot was a bipartisan issue</p> <footer> <cite>Myrna P\u00e9rez</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But Republicans in Texas, Wisconsin, New Mexico and Nevada have opposed these lawsuits. The office of Texas\u2019s attorney general, Ken Paxton, even went so far as to say that anyone who advised a voter they could cast a mail-in ballot because of Covid-19 could be subject to <a href=\"https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/images/admin/2020/Press/4.14.20%20Letter%20to%20Rep.%20Klick.pdf\">\u201ccriminal sanctions\u201d</a>.</p> <p>The Republican National Committee and Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, meanwhile, had already planned to spend <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/20/michigan-voting-lawsuits-rnc-trump-116142\">$10m</a><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/20/michigan-voting-lawsuits-rnc-trump-116142\"> </a>to fight Democratic voting lawsuits.

Election offices were overwhelmed with absentee ballot requests, and some voters never received ballots at all. Turnout didn\u2019t drop as severely as many projected, but voters in Milwaukee were forced to wait hours in line to vote. At least 52 people<a href=\"https://apnews.com/b1503b5591c682530d1005e58ec8c267\"> have since tested positive for Covid-19.</a></p> <p>Without action, there could be similar consequences in November. There might be a delay in issuing ballots, and voters might get their ballots too late to vote, said Michael McDonald, a University of Florida political science professor. A nefarious actor could intentionally slow down the election process by making multiple ballot requests, forcing the election official to investigate (<a href=\"https://www.wbay.com/content/news/Green-Bay-City-Clerk-responds-to-spring-election-concerns--569845391.html\">one clerk</a> in Wisconsin reported a voter requested a ballot 11 times).</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re already seeing failure in a low-turnout election. It\u2019s not gonna get any better in a high-turnout election,\u201d McDonald said.</p> <p>More voting by mail will also slow down reporting of election results, since election officials would have to count ballots coming in after election night. This could leave room for a candidate to question the legitimacy of the results.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m concerned not only that a delay in reporting results will leave room for people to claim fraud, but also potentially for a candidate who\u2019s ahead in an early count to claim victory while the votes may shift as additional votes are counted,\u201d Hasen said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/23/coronavirus-fight-to-vote-us-voters\">'We can\u2019t afford to wait': coronavirus could shut out droves of new US voters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Breaking from Trump, some Republican officials have embraced vote by mail, though modestly.

Such a move could force Republican counterparts to follow suit.</p> <p>\u201cThe intransigence of the Republicans to think that anything that might increase turnout might help the Democrats is very shortsighted,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cI think Republicans are making a huge strategic error here if they don\u2019t want to provide resources.\u201d</p>",

In <a href=\"https://www.pfaw.org/blog-posts/trump-judge-claims-states-cant-be-sued-for-voting-rights-act-violations-confirmed-judges-confirmed-fears/\">February</a>, the circuit rejected Alabama\u2019s argument that people and organizations could not file suit against the state for violating the federal Voting Rights Act (VRA).

Before Branch\u2019s federal appellate confirmation, she was a judge on Georgia\u2019s court of appeals, her 11th circuit biography <a href=\"http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/judges/hon-elizabeth-l-branch\">says.</a></p> <h2><strong>John K Bush</strong></h2> <h2><strong>Sixth </strong><strong>circuit </strong><strong>court of </strong><strong>appeals</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>Eastern and </strong><strong>western </strong><strong>districts of Kentucky; </strong><strong>eastern and </strong><strong>western </strong><strong>districts of Michigan; </strong><strong>northern and </strong><strong>southern </strong><strong>districts of Ohio; </strong><strong>eastern, </strong><strong>middle</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>western </strong><strong>districts of Tennessee.</strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Since ascending to the appellate bench, Bush\u2019s decisions have indicated a pattern with the potential to undermine oversight and civil rights, progressive court-watchers contend. Bush, 55, and Judge Joan Larsen, who is also a Trump appointee, upheld the dismissal of a lawsuit that involved an airline employee who was terminated after complaining to company higher-ups about safety concerns involving her supervisor.</p> <p>The former employee, a technical writer whose work involved operations and maintenance manuals for pilots, claimed that she was protected from the firing despite being an \u201cat will\u201d worker. She cited an Ohio law that prohibits firing people if doing so is in violation of public policy. She contended that she was protected under this law, arguing that public safety was public policy, says PFAW.</p> <p>In his January opinion, Bush wrote that she \u201cfailed to provide clear notice \u2026 that she was invoking a governmental policy in her complaints\u201d, meaning her \u201cdismissal did not jeopardize any public policy, and the facts of her case do not trigger Ohio\u2019s public-policy exception to the at-will employment doctrine\u201d.</p> <p>In July, Bush voted to affirm the dismissal without trial of a free speech case. In that lawsuit, protesters had claimed that they were wrongfully arrested while trying to protest against the Kentucky Farm Bureau for alleged discriminatory policies.</p> <p>\u201cBush is one of the earliest judges that was put on the court by Trump and therefore he has one of the longest records \u2013 and his record is broad and deep and bad in a wide variety of cases,\u201d Mincberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find a single area where Bush hasn\u2019t written a decision, or dissent, that would take the law backwards.\u201d</p> <p>Before Bush\u2019s confirmation, Buzzfeed <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/zoetillman/one-of-trumps-judicial-nominees-blogged-under-a-pen-name#.yf0mEWZK5\">reported</a> that he had likened abortion to slavery in a pseudonymous blogpost, writing that they were the \u201ctwo greatest tragedies in our country\u201d.

  "<p>When Joana Opoku-Darko\u2019s daughter Anna was 18 months old, she came down with malaria, a disease common in Ghana and especially deadly for children.</p> <p>She bought medication from a pharmacy in Ghana\u2019s capital, Accra; when Anna\u2019s fever didn\u2019t subside she took her to a hospital, where they ran some tests.</p> <p>\u201cI was anxious, as a first-time mother.

Had she not gone to the hospital, Anna could have become another sorry statistic in a country flooded with substandard medicines.</p> <p>The experience has Opoku-Darko worried about the pandemic, especially as experts warn issues of falsified drugs, already very deadly in Africa, will become even greater under Covid-19.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The current focus on curbing Covid-19 spread means there is less focus on routine market surveillance</p> <footer> <cite>Delese Mimi Darko, chief executive of Ghana\u2019s Food and Drug Authority</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/28-11-2017-1-in-10-medical-products-in-developing-countries-is-substandard-or-falsified\">World Health Organi</a><a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/28-11-2017-1-in-10-medical-products-in-developing-countries-is-substandard-or-falsified\">zation</a> (WHO) estimates that one in 10 medical products circulating in low- and middle-income countries are either substandard or fake, which is both dangerous and a waste of precious family money. Various academic studies have put the prevalence at between 11% and 48%.</p> <p>Of 1,500 reports of such products, most came from Africa (42%), with south-east Asia also a major hotspot for fake medications.</p> <p>It is impossible to know precisely how many such medicines are in the system. Delese Mimi Darko, chief executive of Ghana\u2019s Food and Drug Authority (FDA), says this is an ongoing problem, especially as people smuggle drugs across the country\u2019s borders. She too worries that Ghana, with more than 1,500 reported Covid-19 cases, will see an increase in falsified and substandard medicines due to the pandemic. Already the FDA has seized substandard hand-sanitisers.</p> <p>\u201cThe current focus on curbing Covid-19 spread means there is less focus on routine market surveillance,\u201d says Darko. \u201cThis means there could be an influx across porous borders of substandard medical products \u2013 including those for Covid-19.\u201d</p> <p>Measures like social distancing and lockdowns limit the work the regulators could do, she added.</p> <p>The FDA is also keeping an eye on social media posts offering unsubstantiated cures. Ghana\u2019s police service has cautioned people to beware online offers of vaccines for Covid-19.

So, if a new medication comes up which manages the condition, that makes it very attractive for people to want to latch on to it, so we all have to be vigilant.\u201d</p> <p>Chloroquine is no longer used in Ghana to treat malaria, but rumours suggest substandard chloroquine has been in circulation. \u201cIf we find any chloroquine on the market now, there is likely to be issues with it,\u201d says Boateng.</p> <p>In March, an Interpol operation <a href=\"https://www.interpol.int/en/News-and-Events/News/2020/Global-operation-sees-a-rise-in-fake-medical-products-related-to-COVID-19\">reported an increase</a> of more than 100% in seizures of unauthorised chloroquine, compared with the previous year.

  "<p>You\u2019ve heard of preppers, right? Survivalists? If you\u2019ve watched TV shows like <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com.au/tv/doomsday-preppers/\">Doomsday Preppers</a>, you know about their strange, apocalyptic beliefs: that a disaster could strike at any time, overwhelming first responders and the social safety net; that this crisis could disrupt supply chains, causing scarcity and panic and social breakdown; that authorities might invoke emergency powers and impose police curfews. Crazy theories like that.</p> <p>In fact, many perfectly reputable organizations \u2013 including the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/foodwater/prepare.html\">US</a> <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/f&amp;web.pdf\">federal</a> <a href=\"https://www.ready.gov/food\">government</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.redcross.org/get-help/how-to-prepare-for-emergencies/survival-kit-supplies.html\">Red Cross</a> \u2013 recommend Americans maintain extra food and emergency supplies. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) advises keeping a two-week supply of food, as well as water, batteries, medical masks, first-aid supplies and a battery- or hand-powered radio, among other things.</p> <p>In mainstream society, however, interest in prepping usually invites ridicule about bunkers and tin-foil hats. Preppers have spent years as the <a href=\"https://reason.com/2013/02/20/stop-demonizing-preppers-2/\">objects of our collective derision</a>.</p> <p>Until now. Today, we\u2019re all preppers \u2013 or rather, wish we had been.<strong> </strong>Non-preppers have been caught in a rain shower without an umbrella. I don\u2019t know if preppers are laughing right now, but perhaps they\u2019re entitled to <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2020-03-15/not-exactly-gloating-stockpiling-preppers-have-a-moment\">some vindication</a>.</p> <p>Now, I\u2019m not a prepper. I am an effete quasi-intellectual with no practical skills of any kind. My current \u201cemergency supplies\u201d are some Hungry-Man Dinners and a liter of bourbon. If things get really bad I will finish the bourbon, lie down and wait to be eaten by stray cats.</p> <p>But I\u2019ve come to respect the preppers\u2019 ethos of survival and preparedness. One of my friends is one, or at least on the spectrum. When coronavirus hit, he wasn\u2019t one of the millions of people scrambling for surgical masks; he already had them in his survival kit. He kept a few and gave the rest to elderly people.</p> <p>It has become fashionable to <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/03/trump-socialism-and-coronavirus-epidemic/607681/\">argue</a> \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/28/coronavirus-regulations-slow-hiring-of-doctors-and-nurses-staffing-firms-say.html\">not</a> <a href=\"https://www.wpr.org/physician-assistants-want-step-fight-coronavirus-state-regulations-may-be-getting-way\">entirely</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/upshot/hospital-rules-relaxed-coronavirus-fight.html\">accurately</a> \u2013 that there are \u201cno libertarians in a pandemic\u201d. Certainly, this crisis has been a stark reminder of the importance of collective action. We\u2019re all on this ship together; Covid-19 has laid bare the pathetic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/16/profit-over-people-cost-over-care-americas-broken-healthcare-exposed-by-virus\">inadequacy</a> of the US social safety net, our lack of investment in the common good, and our government\u2019s short attention span for preparing for crises that don\u2019t involve terrorism or war.</p> <p>But collective action also requires some level of individual responsibility and preparedness, too, at least for those with the ability and the means. You can\u2019t aid your elderly, immunocompromised or poorer neighbors if you haven\u2019t taken the bare minimum of preparations. There\u2019s a reason that airplane safety demonstrations warn passengers to put on their own air-masks before assisting others.</p> <p>We\u2019re right to be angry at the people stripping supermarkets bare and hoarding desperately needed supplies. Those people aren\u2019t preppers, however. Preppers don\u2019t engage in panic-buying. That\u2019s the whole point. That\u2019s why it is called prepping.</p> <p>\u201cPrepping is a choice that occurs before a panic, not during,\u201d a prepper recently <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/fj07cf/time_for_a_little_gatekeeping/\">complained</a> on Reddit. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t stock up over time, you are a hoarder or, perhaps worse, an opportunist. In times like these we need to come together and support one another. That doesn\u2019t mean giving away your supplies, but it does mean living in a society.\u201d</p> <p>Another added, \u201cWe aren\u2019t the reason that elderly or immunocompromised people can\u2019t find hand sanitizer, masks or toilet paper. We bought things in small increments when it made zero impact on the supply.\u201d</p> <p>Yes, some preppers are individualistic to the point of being antisocial. Rightwing survivalists, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/world/la-xpm-2012-feb-08-la-na-american-redoubt-20120209-story.html?mod=article_inline\">in particular</a>, are often motivated by paranoid, apocalyptic, and racist or conspiratorial beliefs. A massive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/10/preppers-survivalists-survivalcon-expo-nuclear-bomb-republicans-mormons\">doomsday industry</a> caters to their fantasies with expensive survival supplies of questionable utility.</p> <p>The preppers we encounter in popular culture are invariably the worst examples - religious or political zealots, eccentrics, middle-aged men suffering crises of masculinity, and, in the case of shows such as Doomsday Preppers, caricatures selected for entertainment value.</p> <p>But not all are gun and gear fetishists with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/02/preppers-survivalist-summit-constitution-americas-midlife-crisis\">delusions of grandeur</a>; many are apolitical or even <a href=\"https://theend.substack.com/\">left</a><a href=\"https://theend.substack.com/\">wing</a>. Global warming, environmental degradation and anxiety about the Trump administration have <a href=\"https://qz.com/973095/the-new-doomsayers-taking-up-arms-and-preparing-for-catastrophe-american-liberals/\">spurred</a> liberals and leftists into the fold. Websites such as <a href=\"https://theprepared.com/\">ThePrepared</a> offer useful, non-alarmist advice on disaster preparedness.</p> <p>The more sophisticated practitioners have always understood that prepping is a matter of both individual and collective wellbeing. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, better known as the Mormon church, operates a massive network of grain silos and food depots. People undergoing hardship receive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/jul/02/salt-lake-city-socialism-mormon-style-utah\">food and household goods</a>, for free or in exchange for volunteer service, at the church\u2019s Costco-style warehouses. The system is vertically integrated, with food supplied by <a href=\"https://www.mormonwiki.com/Bishop%27s_Storehouses\">church-owned farms</a>. All Mormons are also <a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/emergency-preparedness?lang=eng\">encouraged</a> to maintain emergency stockpiles in their home \u2013 not only for their own sake, but to assist neighbors when a hurricane or flood strikes.</p> <p><em>When</em> disaster strikes, not if. The problem is that disasters always look like remote possibilities before they occur, and historical abstractions afterward. Even the coronavirus, as insurmountable as it seems, will eventually pass; we will return to normalcy, and then complacency, and maybe even go back to ridiculing preppers.</p> <p>Yet global warming probably means more and more of these kinds of crises \u2013 natural disasters, but also economic instability and possibly more pandemics, as thawing ice <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/24/climate-change-thawing-deadly-diseases-anthrax\">releases long-dormant pathogens</a>.</p> <p>I suspect the real reason many people instinctively recoil from prepping is psychological. Prepping comes across as pessimistic or even cynical. But perhaps it is better to think of it as pragmatism. We should prepare for disasters for the same reason we buy life insurance or back up computer files: hope for the best, plan for the worst.</p> <p>Recently, while doing some quarantine cleaning, I found several books I acquired during younger \u2013 less lazy, and more idealistic \u2013 days: The Boy Scout Fieldbook; The US Army Survival Manual; Living Off the Country. It seems unlikely they\u2019ll prove too relevant here in Brooklyn, New York, but I\u2019ve decided to brush up anyway.

  "<p>Set against the 1984 miners\u2019 strike, James Clarke\u2019s first novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/22/litten-path-by-james-clarke-review\">The Litten Path</a></em> won the 2019 Betty Trask prize and made itself at home with poverty, localism and landscape. <em>Hollow in the Land</em> explores similar territory, but shifts the action from a Yorkshire pit village to a valley in Lancashire, somewhere among the clusters of towns and islands of moorland. Thirteen fragmentary glimpses of valley life follow the contours if not the map: the novel emerges from these stories, as an oblique but steadily focusing picture of the way things are.</p> <p>Moody eccentricity prevails, often at the edge of violence. Contrasts between fantasy and realism flicker like the light on the abandoned quarries, the ailing sawmill, the dingy pubs. In the chapter called \u201cField Mouse\u201d, Jim and Lenny, a boy of 11 and a girl a little older, befriend the drunk former sailor from next door. His house is smelly, full of poorly stuffed animals. He shows off his \u201cstaff\u201d with its hare\u2019s-skull handle; his wrist, tattooed with a set of numbers beneath a complicated compass design \u2013 the key, perhaps, to some underland from the imagination of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/alangarner\">Alan Garner</a>. In a children\u2019s book he would be their guide to an occult layer of the world. What he\u2019s a guide to here is quite different.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The hollow is a zone of wrong decisions and deaths by misadventure, binding generations together as it pulls them apart</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If \u201cField Mouse\u201d is a fantasy story with the fantasy scraped out, \u201cThis Strange Light\u201d is a policier with the crime ground down to a mark on the surface. Annie, a London cop, tired and disillusioned, returns to the valley for her Aunt Rosie\u2019s funeral. We suspect from the start that something is not right: the story seems reluctant to tell us what, though it\u2019s willing to admit to a mysterious stain on Rosie\u2019s bedroom wall; and Annie\u2019s sister, who inherited the house, is full of an inexplicably restless energy. Meanwhile, in \u201cBlack Ice\u201d, Benj, a man who recently finished a prison sentence for causing death by dangerous driving, pursues Dani the optician, whose husband has died in an industrial accident. Benj and Dani are full of mourning wonder and repressed rage at how their lives ended up. Grief in the time of alcohol and MDMA pivots slowly and then suddenly from self-examination into repetition-compulsion.</p> <p>Everyone in this novel is having an affair or suffering from something \u2013 skin diseases, allergies, brain damage from a fall off a quarry truck; perhaps just a simple puzzlement. They have been drunk since they were kids. They live between work, or the lack of it, by day; and, by night, at Brooklyn\u2019s Wine Lodge, where on a Friday the bouncer is a member of \u201cthe valley family you wanted to mess with least\u201d. They are all suffering static flight reflex, but it has given them a sense of humour, a distanced recognition and tolerance of other people\u2019s flaws \u2013 an outlook that flip-flops from kindness to violence and back again across a round of drinks.</p> <p>Where <em>The Litten Path</em> focused on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/guardianwitness-blog/2015/mar/05/miners-strike-30-years-on-i-fought-not-just-for-my-pit-but-for-the-community\">miners\u2019 </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/guardianwitness-blog/2015/mar/05/miners-strike-30-years-on-i-fought-not-just-for-my-pit-but-for-the-community\">strike</a> and its immediate effects on a community, <em>Hollow in the Land</em> occupies itself with the deindustrialisation and impoverishment that washed across the north afterwards. Though the authorial voice is as forthright as the characters\u2019 own, implication outweighs directness. The structure of each episode finds a means to look slightly away from its own denouement \u2013 sometimes the reader is left wondering what they have missed. At first the prose seems a little uneven from section to section, but as you read, your appreciation of Clarke\u2019s grip on method and material increases. His images are startling and often startlingly apt: a solicitor suffers a heart attack, \u201csliding off the bench in the garden like scrambled eggs from a plate\u201d; roses are \u201cshrivelled into little clumps of burnt cellophane by the winter\u201d.</p> <p>This is a novel about belonging. The pressure to leave the valley, to find something \u2013 anything \u2013 somewhere else, is held in tension with the urge to return to its struggling hair salons and gloomy rains, its hillside ruins that resemble \u201cthe beginnings of a misspelled word\u201d, where you face the inevitable penalties for your disloyalty. The hollow in the land is a zone of wrong decisions and deaths by misadventure. It\u2019s only 10 miles long but it stretches to fit your life, binding the generations together even as it pulls them apart. You must take these characters as you find them. Without pulling punches or closing his eyes to anything, Clarke makes it possible to do that, in a novel full of insight, empathy and wry laughter.</p> <ul> <li><p>Hollow in the Land by James Clarke (Profile Books Ltd, \u00a312.99).

  "<p>Photographing a funeral is never easy, no matter how professional the photographer, and even more so amid a pandemic. But for <a href=\"http://www.nicolanfranchi.com/\">Nicol\u00f3 Lanfranchi</a>, capturing the burial of Covid-19 victim Elizabeth Baez, 82, which took place this month at the S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Batista cemetery in Rio de Janeiro, was especially difficult.</p> <p>As he photographed the gravediggers in protective clothing with Elizabeth\u2019s son Henrique, 49, the only mourner allowed, watching on from behind a mask, Lanfranchi thought of his own father, Piero.

  "<p>My darling mother died early this month. Her death was peaceful and painless \u2013 and it was not due to the coronavirus.<strong> </strong>Yet it was shaped by the pandemic, as is its aftermath. The register office, the undertakers, the crematorium: the usual institutions of death are now inundated. The administrative and social rituals that busy your mind have practically disappeared. The friends dropping by, the swell of a funeral, the hugs: all are statutorily absent.</p> <p>It began with a urinary tract infection, of all things: a bothersome visitor but hardly unknown to my mother. If her body could not fight it off, then ordinarily an ambulance would whisk her off to hospital for stronger drugs and a bag of fluids. Not this time. The hospitals were almost overwhelmed, I was told, and parts are rife with contagion. And already she was so weak. On my mother\u2019s last afternoon, I sat by her bedside, on the phone to the community matron, who told me that another nursing home had that day sent a resident to A&amp;E \u2013 just for the medics to call and say they were returning her to the home to die.</p> <p>As her only child, I took what I hope was the best decision. Whether it really was is still a question that wakes me up in the dark.</p> <p>Another question ought to be asked, this one in public. Amid the focus on pulling the NHS through this plague, how many people have had their lives cut short because they couldn\u2019t get hospital treatment for illnesses other than coronavirus? The leading statistician David Spiegelhalter, at Cambridge University, told me he sees a \u201clarge transfer\u201d in the number of non-Covid-19 deaths from hospitals to homes and care homes. Some have been mis-recorded, while others have died in their bed rather than under the stark lights of a strange ward. But, as he observes, \u201cmany could have had their lives extended had they gone to hospital\u201d. The Office for National Statistics says it is now examining that gulf, but there is a high chance that those people are the collateral damage of a health system that has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/22/giving-nhs-charity-fundraising-coronavirus-state-taxes\">starved of cash for years</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c1f373465736569ff98fb9c6468dea27053dd73e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1f373465736569ff98fb9c6468dea27053dd73e/0_0_1024_1536/667.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Stay sharp, mischievous and free\u2019: Arati Chakrabortty and her son Aditya on his wedding day, 2017.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Stay sharp, mischievous and free\u2019: Arati Chakrabortty and her son Aditya on his wedding day, 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexander Leaman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the undertakers came to take my mother\u2019s body, three of the staff at the nursing home where she spent her last few weeks ushered me away. All were black, and on my reckoning, first-generation immigrants: from Cameroon, Ghana, and the West Indies. I would also guess that at least one earns less than the<strong> </strong>\u00a330,000 a year the government proposed as the baseline for immigrants to get work visas. But for now they are carers to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/apr/09/boris-johnson-moved-from-intensive-care-but-stays-in-hospital\">applauded on Downing Street</a>.</p> <p>A primary school teacher in Hackney for decades, Arati Chakrabortty would today be termed a \u201ckey worker\u201d. And as I looked at the carers in their protective gear, too flimsy to deter any virus, I knew my mother would have recognised something of their world. <br><br>In the 1980s her staffroom was a whistlestop tour of the British empire: Nigeria, Trinidad, Ireland, India, Pakistan. All women, quick on their feet and with their wits, and on pay far below their qualifications. Every day Mother went in wearing a sari far too lovely for the litter-strewn streets of 80s Hackney. During my school holidays she would drag me along to help: as we trundled down the road in our rickety hatchback, van drivers would cut her up and shout that she was a \u201cpaki\u201d who should fuck off back home.</p> <p>She was more than they could ever know. In the 1940s, when she was little, her family fled the Japanese bombing of Burma on the last ship out of Rangoon. All except her father, who along with other Indian men was stripped of his ticket by the British and had to walk through the mountains to get to India. The trek broke his health and he died not long after, leaving my mother and her brother and sister to be raised by a young widow \u2013 in a place and time where jobs and money were men\u2019s business. They were plunged close to poverty, then saw their family land in East Bengal disappear after partition. Even now, as our world is turned upside down, it is worth remembering that some among us have lived through far worse.</p> <p>Yet she had a will of iron. When the then prestigious Benares Hindu University made her sit an undergraduate exam in Sanskrit, a subject she hated, she retaliated by dipping her fountain pen in the inkwell and flicking it across the paper, leaving the blots and dots to be marked by some poor soul. When she arrived in London in the late 60s to do postgraduate study, she hunted for a bedsit among signs reading \u201cNo Irish, no Blacks, no Dogs\u201d. But she hardly dwelled on bad memories, preferring to talk about how Sarat Chandra Chatterjee\u2019s novels of Bengali peasant life reminded her of Thomas Hardy, and her soft spot for Maxim Gorky, his hard upbringing and good politics.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>She was the teacher every parent wanted for their kid, the smiling sari-clad lady who could turn around the toughest nut</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This was the era of Margaret Thatcher and her \u201calien hordes\u201d. The right viewed my mother then as it now sees Polish builders and Somali carers: as outsiders here to take from Britain. The left retorted, as it still does, by counting how much they give Britain. Even today, neither side sees them as people with their own memories, dreams, worlds. Who might have something to teach Britain.</p> <p>My mother\u2019s love of Shakespeare and Hazlitt was not an attempt to fit in. She claimed them as she claimed all of world culture. Nothing was off-limits.</p> <p>That liberty was what she wanted for everybody \u00ad\u2013 especially for the generations of children who passed through her class. She was the teacher every parent wanted for their kids, the smiling sari-clad lady who could turn round the toughest nuts.</p> <p>After retirement, she volunteered to teach Turkish and Kurdish migrant families who were moving into the streets where I\u2019d been brought up \u2013 and when poor health meant she couldn\u2019t manage the bus, she got my father to drive her. When he died, she asked me to lobby the school opposite her house for a classroom in the evenings so she could carry on.</p> <p>One other episode keeps coming to mind. Towards the end, my mother\u2019s faculties were corroded by dementia. I wheeled her up to the hospital for a memory test. The questions were childishly simple \u00ad\u2013 what is the date, who is the prime minister \u00ad\u2013 but my mother\u2019s responses were faltering, which exasperated her. It was not pleasant to see. Then, right at the end, the doctor asked her to write her name. For the briefest moment, a look I knew well passed over my mother\u2019s face. Carefully she wielded the pen. The doctor looked down, then in confusion showed me the pad. <br><br>She had written her name, all right \u00ad\u2013 in Bengali, so he had no way of knowing whether she had done it right or wrong. Although silent, her message was clear: she would not fit someone else\u2019s categories.</p> <p>Now she has left me, us. She will not see our toddler grow up, or meet her second granddaughter, who arrives next month. But if both girls learn not to be defined by others, to stay instead sharp and mischievous and free, then Mrs Chakrabortty will have delivered a most valuable lesson.</p> <p>\u2022 Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist</p>",

  "<h2>Top story: UK hospital chiefs accuse ministers of tests \u2018red herring\u2019</h2> \n<p>Morning everyone. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories this Thursday.</p> \n<p>Donald Trump has accused the Chinese government of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/trump-claims-china-will-do-anything-to-stop-his-re-election-as-coronavirus-row-escalates\">doing \u201canything they can\u201d to see him lose the presidential election </a>this year, in what marks a serious escalation of the war of words between the two superpowers over the coronavirus pandemic. In an Oval Office interview with Reuters, the US president said he was looking into different options for the consequences China might face for its handling of the pandemic. \u201cI can do a lot,\u201d he said, before adding that Beijing\u2019s actions had \u201cupset very badly\u201d the much-vaunted trade deal between the countries. Trump also said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/29/trump-government-wont-extend-coronavirus-distancing-guidelines\">he would not extend federal social distancing guidelines</a> when they expire today, despite US deaths from Covid-19 passing 60,000.

Despite a record 52,000 tests being carried out on Wednesday, 19,000 were re-tests and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/hospital-chiefs-increasingly-frustrated-with-uk-testing-failures\">hospital leaders criticised ministers</a> for \u201ca series of frequent tactical announcements\u201d about testing targets. They said it was a \u201cred herring\u201d that had distracted from wider policy failures. Just days after Matt Hancock pledged to meet the 100,000 target by the end of April, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/uk-turned-down-offer-of-10000-coronavirus-tests-a-day-four-weeks-ago\">the government turned down an offer of 10,000 testing kits a day</a> from a US company.

It comes as deaths in care homes and the wider community were added to the UK total, bringing the number of fatalities to 26,097 and leaving the country\u2019s toll behind only those of the US and Italy. South Korea today recorded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/south-korea-records-no-new-domestic-cases-of-covid-19-for-first-time-since-february\">no new cases for the first time since February</a>.

  "<p>Hop into something comfy and let\u2019s get started!\u201d This is how Adriene Mishler, YouTube\u2019s biggest yoga guru, begins many of her videos. For those of us who are not spending our quarantine days writing an update of King Lear or attempting to follow along with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/apr/01/shape-of-the-future-how-barrys-bootcamp-changed-the-way-we-work-out\" title=\"\">Barry\u2019s Bootcamp</a> on Instagram, Mishler\u2019s just-show-up approach to yoga is a comfort and a welcome distraction. In recent months, she has been described as \u201cthe patron saint of quarantine\u201d (Paper magazine), \u201cthe most influential yoga teacher on the planet\u201d (Refinery29), and \u201cOur saviour\u201d (a fan on Twitter).</p> <p>Mishler was already huge before the pandemic \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene\" title=\"\">her channel</a>, which has more than 7 million subscribers, is the first to pop up when you search for \u201cyoga\u201d on YouTube \u2013 but the lockdown has catapulted her to a new level of fame. Fans on social media recommend their favourite videos, post charcoal drawings of her and express their undying devotion to her for keeping them sane. One devotee even built <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benagain/status/1250357935601004550\" title=\"\">a digital replica</a> of her home studio in the video game Animal Crossing. There are countless memes about her, as well as ones about her dog, a blue heeler, or Australian cattle dog, named Benji, who frequently makes cameo appearances lounging beside the mat, or wandering into shot.</p> <p>Working out at home in the time of coronavirus is fraught. Most of us don\u2019t have much space to spare, let alone weights or props to replicate the gym (or a steam room or a woman arguing on her phone while jogging on a treadmill next to you). But even for those of us committed to being deeply unambitious during this period, exercise does eventually seem like a good idea, if not just to make up for all the pasta dinners and handfuls of milk chocolate \u2013 also to alleviate boredom, or sore backs from sitting cross-legged on the couch all day, or to introduce some movement beyond padding in slippers a few feet from the bedroom to a makeshift standing desk (a laptop propped up on a cupboard), or to give the illusion of some form of routine.</p> <p>Even though every form of exercise, from pilates to ecstatic dance, is being offered in online workouts, and in many cases for free, yoga seems to have risen to the top. It doesn\u2019t require any fancy accessories \u2013 you don\u2019t even need a mat \u2013 and there\u2019s a meditative aspect that helps with all of our extremely warranted anxiety.</p> <p>Mishler has pitched herself as the perfect first step for yoga novices. Whatever ails you, Mishler seems to have a class for it. She has videos for back pain, vulnerability (an entirely seated practice with a lot of lying in the foetal position), anger (a lot of breathing exercises and child\u2019s pose to calm down) and self-care (literally hugging yourself). There is yoga for runners (a seven-minute full body stretch for before or after a jog) and for those in the service industry (relief from being on one\u2019s feet all day), and even yoga for writers (\u201cfocus the brain and body inward so you can perform, create and be your best\u201d). Some of the classes can be done in bed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5604b49f436bc792b2d0cb346dee06de2a366282\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5604b49f436bc792b2d0cb346dee06de2a366282/0_0_2483_1928/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two women practising yoga while on lockdown at home in Santiago, Chile.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"776\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two women practising yoga while on lockdown at home in Santiago, Chile.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Bernetti/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Maybe what attracts so many people to Mishler is what she\u2019s not: she isn\u2019t threatening, has none of the holier-than-thou quality of someone who just came back from rigorous spiritual training, and nor is she stone-faced or humourless. On screen, Mishler, who is 35, comes across as sweet and wholesome, like the one popular girl in school who was actually kind. Her classes tend to be slow-placed, with clear instructions for absolute beginners and insight for more experienced students. She\u2019s good at telling you how to avoid injury, which is important when there\u2019s no teacher in the room to correct or guide you deeper into a pose. She can occasionally seem a little homespun \u2013 with her Texan \u201chowdy\u201d \u2013 or get a little spiritual and write on her website that \u201cYoga is really the art of waking up\u201d.</p> <p>Right now, while we are stuck \u2013 in our cramped apartments, our crowded living rooms, our sunless basement flats, our solitary terraces \u2013 yoga offers us a solution, an escape, a way to unwind. It doesn\u2019t come larded with the kind of ambition that drives people to train for marathons or visit the gym several times a week to lose weight. Yoga is only interested in the present, an apt philosophy at a moment when the future is so uncertain. As a teacher, Mishler is not doing anything revolutionary, but she has struck a chord in these anxious times. By not doing too much, and not asking us to do too much, she\u2019s become the woman of the hour.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>These days Mishler receives so many requests that her press office sends automated emails apologising in advance if it takes a while to respond. But after I got through to her voicemail \u2013 which features her singing a song about leaving a message to the tune of the Chili\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ypx4dy/the-inventor-of-the-chilis-baby-back-ribs-song-has-never-eaten-their-ribs\" title=\"\">\u201cbaby back ribs\u201d jingle</a> \u2013 Mishler called me back about a minute later, apologising for missing the call.</p> <p>On the phone from her home in Austin, Texas, Mishler sounded exactly like she does in her videos: extremely friendly, sincere and polite. She thanked me for asking how her quarantine is going. \u201cIt\u2019s best-case scenario,\u201d she said. \u201cMy boyfriend lives eight minutes away. He\u2019s the only person that I see, and he can work at his home and I can work here. A lot of people assume I must be golden \u2026 Oh come on, buddy!\u201d \u2013 she broke off to yell at Benji the dog, who was barking in the background. Others are having a much harder time of it, she said, such as her friends who have kids, but she admitted to having occasional wobbles. \u201cYou have your own discombobulated moment each day where you feel like you\u2019re in the Groundhog Day movie.\u201d</p> <p>Mishler grew up in an arty family in Austin. As a teenager, she took acting classes, in which she learned about mind-body practices such as yoga. Later, while trying to make it as a professional actor \u2013 among her early roles was a cameo as \u201ccute female student\u201d in an episode of the TV show Friday Night Lights \u2013 she qualified as a yoga teacher and taught some classes. Her main frame of reference for exercising at home was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/apr/13/fitness-retro-workouts\" title=\"\">Jane Fonda\u2019s</a> classic 1980s do-it-for-the-burn aerobics videos, along with Rodney Yee\u2019s yoga DVDs, which featured a lot of instruction but not much fun.</p> <p>The origins of Yoga With Adriene go back to the set of a horror movie, where she met an independent film-maker called Christopher Sharpe, who had helped create a popular YouTube channel starring his wife, the chef Hilah Johnson. Afterwards, Sharpe and Mishler stayed in touch, and in 2012, when Sharpe was looking for new YouTube projects, he asked Mishler if she wanted to start a yoga channel. In September that year, they began uploading videos.</p> <p>\u201cI had this inkling, if we all had an at-home yoga practice, it would change everything \u2013 it could become like a normal hygiene practice, or saying a prayer if you\u2019re a spiritual person,\u201d Mishler told me. \u201cA daily practice that can be medicinal \u2013 you could roll out the mat if you\u2019re stressed. That was a huge stretch in 2012, but I was so broke that I thought it was worth a try.\u201d</p> <p>Yoga studios and, really, gyms in general, can be intimidating places. There\u2019s the fear of looking as if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. It\u2019s easy to stand out by being the largest person in the room, or the only man in the yoga class, or the only woman lifting free weights, or the only person of colour, full stop. Plus, they\u2019re expensive and they require commitment.</p> <p>Mishler\u2019s channel aimed to remove these stresses. One thing that made her videos appealing was that they weren\u2019t filmed in a professional studio or in a fancy home, settings that were popular in older workout videos. By filming in a private space \u2013 Mishler did her workout in a living room \u2013 the videos felt more intimate and personal, tapping into the same qualities that were becoming popular in other YouTube genres, from singing covers of a song in a bedroom to cooking in regular home kitchens.</p> <p>While the setting was clean and bright, it wasn\u2019t aspirational, unlike the Rodney Yee videos, filmed on beaches with spectacular views or at the foot of snow-capped mountains. Mishler was just a nice-looking woman in a nice-enough room wearing a tank top and leggings that didn\u2019t even match. It suited her, but it was also a deliberate decision \u2013 a strategy, even though she hates that word \u2013 to make her the yoga girl next door.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8ba20dfbbb188994dff84e8fcbd3ac716d1c557c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ba20dfbbb188994dff84e8fcbd3ac716d1c557c/0_157_816_367/500.jpg\" alt=\"yoga with adriene - posing with benji the dog - from official website\" width=\"500\" height=\"225\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yoga teacher Adriene Mishler with her dog, Benji.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yoga With Adriene/Find What Feels Good</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In this, Benji is a useful ally. He serves not just as a beloved pet, but as a muse and a beacon of calm as he sleeps on the sidelines. \u201cHe is a great tool for the storytelling. His presence just lends itself so well to not feeling like it\u2019s a super-produced video,\u201d she said, and as if he knew he was being referenced, Benji barked several times in the background. \u201cBenji is a way to tear down the fourth wall without being pretentious. Maybe that\u2019s too heavy of a word. We\u2019re here together and he helps set the tone.\u201d</p> <p>As Mishler was crafting the channel\u2019s tone, Sharpe was carefully studying how YouTube users search for yoga and other workouts, compiling lists of key terms and optimising the titles of the videos. Instead of just creating classes that might suit potential needs, they looked at Sharpe\u2019s studies and tailored classes according to what people were searching for. This is why Mishler\u2019s classes include Yoga for Back Pain, Yoga for Lower Back Pain, Yoga for Upper Back Pain, as well as Upper Back Love, and, of course, Lower Back Love.</p> <p>The YouTube channel wasn\u2019t an overnight hit. It took about two years of posting a new video each week to reach 200,000 subscribers, and that was the point at which it started to become commercially successful. Mishler\u2019s videos aren\u2019t heavily branded, but the website Social Blade, which tracks growth on YouTube, estimates that the channel could make as much as $188,500 per month on advertising revenue alone.</p> <p>For hardcore fans looking to venture further into the Mishler universe, there is also a subscription service ($9.99 per month) called Find What Feels Good, in which the best-friend vibe is amped up even more, via exclusive classes, vlogs, meditations and blog posts. She also leads retreats, and holds large events for International Yoga Day each June. But this year, a retreat in Mexico City combining Spanish lessons and yoga \u2013 Mishler\u2019s mother is Mexican \u2013 scheduled for May had to be cancelled, as did an upcoming event at the United Nations.</p> <p>On 12 April, Mishler began her email newsletter with the following: \u201cI am sending you some loving energy from my humble abode. It is Sunday. Just in case you need a reminder.\u201d And then she included a poem, which, depending on your perspective, will be either painfully twee or gently comforting:</p> <p><em>Today is another day in which we are blessed with the opportunity to rise,</em><br><em>To continue, and awaken.</em><br><em>To slowly nod with forgiveness,</em><br><em>Squint the eyes \u2013</em><br><em>Just a bit,</em><br><em>And whisper,</em><br><em>I got this.</em></p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>I attended a Californian high school that offered yoga as part of its physical education programme. At 16 I signed up for it \u2013 along with all the other misfits who weren\u2019t enrolled in typical private-school sports such as lacrosse or field hockey \u2013 and learned crow pose and breathing techniques from a long-haired ageing hippie with a gentle demeanour. I liked it enough, but didn\u2019t take yoga classes again until after university, when I found myself living down the street from a yoga studio.</p> <p>In 2015, after I joined a studio in Manhattan, I would go to a yoga class every couple of days. This year I took the plunge, going from being a yoga student who attended class a few times a week to teaching a restorative yoga class once a week at a downtown studio called Sky Ting. I have never thought of myself as a natural teacher, but I loved it. Teaching was, frankly, kind of a power trip. I like being in charge, putting together a playlist, watching students tumble out of class in a relaxed afterglow. My classes were in the late afternoon on Thursdays. Friends came by, but so did people I didn\u2019t know, and they started to come every week, which was thrilling: I knew what I was doing enough that people wanted more. I started in the second week of January, but was only able to teach for two months before business was suspended.</p> <p>On a recent Sunday evening, I taught one class via Instagram from my sitting room. My yoga studio provided its teachers with notes on setting up, from how to best position our phones to tips on creating as inviting a space as possible in a tiny New York apartment (plants and natural light are good, dirty floors and clutter are best avoided). I tend not to speak a lot during my classes. It\u2019s a conscious choice based on years of wishing that I could zone out and not have to hear a teacher chattering along. But a lot of silence while demonstrating poses alone in front of a screen just translates to dead air, which feels awkward, so I found myself making commentary to fill up the silence. My class, like Mishler\u2019s, was treated to a spontaneous appearance by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/12/doctors-note-dog-on-plane-emotional-support-animals\" title=\"\">my bulldog, Joan</a>, when she wandered over to investigate what I was doing. I missed touching my students, running a hand down their spine to encourage deeper relaxation or massaging their foreheads to relieve tension. But I also loved that anyone could join, and students could say hello or send a comment through the app. (That said, I could have done without the person who kept messaging me to say I should change my music.)</p> <p>Because so many studios have taken their classes online, I\u2019ve also got to tune into some of my favourite far-flung teachers and friends, from Portugal to Los Angeles. When I spoke to one of these teachers, Kyle Miller, about her experience of teaching on Zoom, she was near-rapturous. \u201cGetting to see everyone, talk and hang out in the moments before and after class, getting to watch the students as they practise and teach right to them, it\u2019s been incredible and unexpected,\u201d she said. \u201cIt honestly feels like I\u2019ve socialised. I ride a high after my streams!\u201d Yoga teachers, it seems, are perhaps the world\u2019s most gifted people when it comes to putting a positive spin on things.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Mishler is not really a superstar teacher like the types who headline Wanderlust \u2013 the global travelling yoga festival that is sort of like Coachella for the spiritually inclined, at which fans shell out around $200 to take massive yoga classes led by teachers talking rapturously about the need to be humble. Nor is Mishler <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/apr/05/its-genuine-you-know-why-the-online-influencer-industry-is-going-authentic\" title=\"\">an influencer</a> in the current sense, posing for highly branded and sponsored photos with perfect hair. Her own Instagram is simple and relatively unflashy, featuring photos of the sky, grocery store flowers and, of course, Benji. She is careful not to sound too out-there or new age, and will often poke fun at something she says by using an exaggeratedly calm, smug-yoga-lady voice. Her online persona recalls a time when normal people could become famous on the internet for being good at being themselves \u2013 Justin Bieber before he became Justin Bieber.</p> <p>Mishler acknowledges that she has made compromises to broaden her reach. She understands that she grew her audience based on a canny understanding of how to target her videos, but there is an awkward disconnect between the kind of yoga she wants to teach and what is most sought after on YouTube. Her most popular videos are, she said, \u201ca tight race between anything that has \u2018anxiety\u2019 in the title and also the yoga for weight loss\u201d. She feels weird about that, she says. \u201cI do not teach yoga for weight loss, that\u2019s not my end goal, but, you know, when that is in the title in the SEO, it attracts a lot more people than it would have otherwise,\u201d she said, sounding a little defensive. \u201cI know there is integrity in the content,\u201d she said.</p> <p>While the coronavirus pandemic has brought legions of new fans, it might also mean that, for the first time, Yoga With Adriene could have some real competition. Every yoga brand is trying to ride out this wave of isolation and come out with more followers at the other end. Local studios from all over the world are live-streaming from home so students can take classes with their favourite teachers, not just what\u2019s free on YouTube. Big brands are also pushing their online classes, including Nike, Alo, Gaia, Sweaty Betty, CorePower, Lululemon and Yoga Journal. Meanwhile, on YouTube, there are now numerous videos that seem to borrow heavily from Yoga With Adriene\u2019s formula: accessible classes performed in homey environments. New competitors include Yoga By Candace and Yoga With Tim. They both include their dogs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/what-coronavirus-can-teach-us-about-hope-rebecca-solnit\">'The impossible has already happened': what coronavirus can teach us about hope</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Whenever we are let out of our homes, my guess would be that yoga studios will have waiting lists. They\u2019ll likely be different from before, operating at no more than a quarter of their usual capacity allowing students (who\u2019ll bring their own mats) to keep two metres apart. But even with those compromises, it will probably feel better than practising one more day in front of a screen.</p> <p>What seemed reassuring in quarantine might feel claustrophobic when we\u2019re let out, and for Mishler, it\u2019s possible that there might be a downside to being so closely associated with a strange and miserable time. While we all troop gratefully back to class, Mishler will still be taping herself at home, doing yoga to a camera in her sitting room, Benji by her side. But worrying too much about the future is not quite in the spirit of Yoga With Adriene, which is all about the here and now. As she writes on her website: \u201cThe process is the candy.

The group wants to force the state to immediately remove voters it suspects have moved from the voter rolls.

But now that the election had passed, Kelly said he saw no ethical obstacle preventing him from hearing the case. \u201cIn light of the fact that this case cannot now affect any election in which I would be a candidate while the case is being decided, there is no ethical bar to my participation in the consideration of the petition for review or the merits of the case if the petition for review is granted,\u201d Kelly wrote in a Wednesday order. Karofsky\u2019s 10-year term begins on 1 August, and she will narrow the conservative majority on the court from 5-2 to 4-3.</p> \n  <p>Stephen Gillers, a law professor at NYU and an expert on judicial ethics, said he did not see anything improper in Kelly\u2019s decision. \u201cIt is rare but not unheard of for a judge who recuses to unrecuse,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cJudge Kelly is still a judge and the matter is before his court.

Before it was blocked by a lower court in 2016, it prevented around 30,000 people from registering to vote. </p> \n  <p><strong>Kris Kobach</strong>, the former Kansas secretary of state nationally known for his anti-immigrant views and support of voting restrictions, championed the measure, saying it was necessary to prevent non-citizens from registering to vote in his state.

The court noted that \u201cat most\u201d 39 non-citizens had registered to vote in Kansas over the last 19 years. Many of those cases, the court be explained by administrative error, and did not justify the burden placed on 30,000 voters. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/rickhasen/status/1255520426798862339\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Whoa!
