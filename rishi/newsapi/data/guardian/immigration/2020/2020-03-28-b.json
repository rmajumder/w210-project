  "<p>Sir Denis Follows, 71, short and bald, started every day\u2019s work by opening his post. It was a habit he\u2019d had as secretary of the Football Association, and a habit he kept as chairman of the British Olympic Association. In between the two jobs, he\u2019d been knighted. Which was some going, for the son of a stationmaster, but it hadn\u2019t changed him much. He still wore a pair of thick horn rims, still worried about putting on weight, was still the same avuncular, pragmatic man who had kept the Jules Rimet trophy under his bed and carried it out to Mexico 70 in his briefcase. And he still had the same set of principles.</p> <p>First among them his idea that sport was above politics. Follows was so \u00adadamant about this that his own daughter still isn\u2019t sure which way he voted, and that adamancy made him one of the key figures in what the Labour parliamentarian Denis Howell described as \u201cthe most epic political battle in which I have ever been engaged\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/24/olympic-postponement-inevitable-but-finding-right-way-to-do-it-caused-delay\">How Tokyo's 2020 hopes turned to ashes \u2013 but can rise again in 2021 | Sean Ingle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Tuesday 22 January 1980, Follows\u2019s morning mail included a \u00adletter from the prime \u00administer, Margaret Thatcher. A month \u00adearlier, the Soviet Union had invaded Afghanistan; six months later, the Soviet Union was due to host the Olympics. Thatcher and the US \u00adpresident, Jimmy Carter, had already decided on a boycott. Thatcher\u2019s foreign secretary, Lord Carrington, pointed out that there was just one problem: \u201cparticipation is not a \u00admatter for governments\u201d, but the national Olympic associations. All the government could do was advise on a course of action.</p> <p>Still, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/feb/24/past.Olympics2012\">the prime minister willed it</a>, when the president of the US wanted it, how much of a \u00adproblem could it really be? Looking back on the Moscow boycott 40 years later, with the benefit of all Thatcher\u2019s declassified papers, briefings and correspondence, the most striking thing about it is how this one man, Sir Denis Follows, an elderly bureaucrat, squared up to the two most \u00adpowerful leaders in the western world and stared them down.</p> <p>\u201cIn an ideal world, I would share entirely the philosophy of the Olympic movement that sport should be divorced from politics, sadly, however, this is no longer a realistic view,\u201d Thatcher wrote. To go to Moscow \u201cwould be to give the \u00adappearance of condoning\u201d the \u00adinvasion. It didn\u2019t occur to her that Follows might \u00addisagree. She pressed ahead with asking him to \u201capproach the International Olympic Committee urgently and propose that the Summer Games be moved from the Soviet Union\u201d. She was convinced the Games should be relocated and suggested Britain could co-host them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e387ea2771c8071f5d616d49c63ae025863b0e64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e387ea2771c8071f5d616d49c63ae025863b0e64/0_329_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former British Olympic Association chairman Sir Denis Follows (centre) insisted sporting boycotts \u2018never do anyone any good\u2019, much to the chagrin of Margaret Thatcher.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former British Olympic Association chairman Sir Denis Follows (centre) insisted sporting boycotts \u2018never do anyone any good\u2019, much to the chagrin of Margaret Thatcher.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thatcher had made a mistake here, as the West German chancellor, Helmut Schmidt, took great pleasure in explaining to Carrington. Her idea to move the Games at six months\u2019 notice was \u201ca still-born child\u201d, Schmidt said. \u201cThose who proposed it had no concept of the organisation of international sport.\u201d But she stuck with it and had a working party run up a list of available venues, even after Follows had told her that the IOC\u2019s response to her idea was \u201cnot \u00addifficult to imagine\u201d.</p> <p>So Thatcher ramped up her \u00adrhetoric. \u201cThe Soviet government hope as another government did in 1936 that the Games will give an immense boost to the state\u2019s prestige internationally,\u201d she told parliament. \u201cThe solution is to move the Games to a place where politics do not predominate.\u201d (The Labour MP Eric Heffer called out: \u201cWhere\u2019s that? The moon?\u201d)</p> <p>Carter, who was facing an election in the autumn, was so glad for her support that he wrote her a \u201cDear Margaret\u201d to express his \u201cdeep personal appreciation\u201d for her speech and applaud her \u201cleadership in launching the Olympic boycott\u201d. In private, her press secretary, Bernard Ingham, was briefing that Thatcher had won over \u201cthe US, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Iran, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain\u201d to the boycott. Or so they thought.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/jun/15/50-olympic-stunning-moments-allan-wells\">50 stunning Olympic moments No39: Allan Wells wins 100m gold in Moscow | Rob Bagchi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then, on 1 February, Follows sent his full reply. There was \u201clittle or no support for the suggestion the Games be moved\u201d he said. As for the \u00adboycott, it wasn\u2019t just his decision, but had to be made by a committee of the heads of each of the individual sports \u00adfederations. They were due to vote on 4 March but had postponed until 25 March, because they had \u201cno desire to embarrass the government\u201d. Follows told Thatcher to \u201crest assured your views will be considered\u201d.</p> <p>Thatcher didn\u2019t \u201crest assured\u201d. Three days later, the cabinet started discussing the possibility of withdrawing all their funding to the Sports Council, who funnelled public money to the BOA. It decided not to. But there were other levers to pull. The government talked to the BBC about cancelling coverage, British Airways about cancelling charter flights to Moscow and the BOA\u2019s corporate partners about cancelling sponsorship. Bupa did and the BOA were left scrabbling to scrape together funds in a public fundraising drive, boosted by support from the unions and several Labour councils.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the Commons, Cranley Onslow MP blamed Follows\u2019 'thick skull' for causing 'a national disgrace'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Thatcher wrote again to Follows: \u201cFor British athletes to go would be for them to seem to condone an international crime.\u201d She decided to deny leave to all civil service, military and police personnel who were due to compete. That, Follows said, \u201crather stiffened\u201d his resolve. When he was called in to face the foreign affairs select committee, he fired back. \u201cBoycotts never do anyone any good,\u201d he said. \u201cSport helps to bridge the gulf between nations, it is the most unifying thing in the world today.\u201d Follows did promise the BOA would \u201cnot ignore\u201d a vote in the Commons on the boycott. But he didn\u2019t promise they would obey it.</p> <p>The MPs voted for the boycott by 315 to 147. Thatcher, who had said she was astonished by Follows\u2019s stance at the select committee, wrote to him again. She was more placatory this time. \u201cWe have the highest admiration for the Olympic ideals. It is not we who are perverting that ideal; rather, it is the Soviet Union.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d60609d4db2dc4da174057f6d1aea16a69321361\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d60609d4db2dc4da174057f6d1aea16a69321361/0_137_3602_2162/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The opening ceremony of the Moscow Olympics in 1980.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The opening ceremony of the Moscow Olympics in 1980.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Duffy/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By now, Carter\u2019s special counsel, Lloyd Cutler, had flown to Europe to meet Follows. Cutler was clear the success of the boycott turned on how Thatcher handled the BOA. \u201cThe prospects for the political success of the boycott remain good provided the impending British defection can be deferred or contained,\u201d Cutler said. The problem was Follows. \u201cSir Denis is a living Colonel Blimp,\u201d he told Carter. \u201cHe is a pure Olympian who puts aside all responsibilities as a \u00adcitizen of the west in favour of sports as the last hope of world peace. His views of Mrs Thatcher and the president are visibly apoplectic.\u201d The feeling was mutual.</p> <p>Follows told Cutler he was \u00ad\u201cperfectly willing to have the British team be the only western European team in Moscow because this would show the BOA followed Olympic principles while the others bowed to their governments\u201d even though \u201che knows the effect on the British government\u2019s prestige at home and abroad will be disastrous\u201d.</p> <p>On 25 March, the BOA voted to go to the Moscow Games. \u201cServes her right,\u201d said Schmidt. Thatcher warned that it was \u201cnot the end of the matter\u201d. In the Commons, the Conservative Cranley Onslow blamed Follows\u2019 \u201cthick skull\u201d for causing \u201ca national disgrace\u201d, and his colleague Keith Best asked Thatcher to \u201cwrite a charming letter to Sir Denis Follows not necessarily describing any part of his anatomy\u201d.</p> <p>But Thatcher was wrong. It was the end of the matter. The British team travelled and won 21 medals, five of them gold, for Duncan Goodhew, Daley Thompson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2006/mar/05/features.sport9\">Allan Wells</a>, Steve Ovett and Seb Coe, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/apr/18/50-olympic-moments-coe-ovett-moscow-1980\">fought their famous duels over 800m and 1500m</a>.</p> <p>Thatcher conspicuously did not invite them, or anyone else, to Downing Street to celebrate. By the time the team were home, Carter\u2019s boycott was already seen as a public relations disaster. His policy foundered on the rock of Follows\u2019s principles. History isn\u2019t always the work of great men, but sometimes modest, unassuming ones too.</p>",

  "<p>With the result of the Labour party leadership contest imminent, I thought I\u2019d be so happy to see the back of Jeremy Corbyn. Now I\u2019m wondering if we ever will.</p> <p>While I would never trivialise coronavirus, at least we\u2019ve been spared mass gatherings of people in \u201cJust say Jez\u201d T-shirts sobbing mawkish goodbyes to the man who \u201cwon the argument\u201d, while tanking two general elections (including the worst Labour result for 85 years). He also presided over a culture of (cough) \u201calleged\u201d antisemitism now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/28/equality-body-launches-investigation-of-labour-antisemitism-claims\">under investigation </a>by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, and facilitated Brexit.</p> <p>Despite all this, not so long ago Corbyn was angling for a shadow cabinet position. One wonders which element of his failure, incompetence and disgrace he thinks could prove useful? Such puffs of hubris indicate that he is having a hard time relinquishing the power he claims to have so little interest in. Corbyn has no intention of going quietly, or indeed at all.</p> <p>None of this has been helped by the protracted leadership contest, though thank Christ they didn\u2019t shorten it, or we\u2019d never have heard the end of it (\u201cIt was rigged!\u201d). Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband left quietly. As did Tony Blair \u2013 and <em>he</em> actually won elections. Compare and contrast with Corbyn and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/john-mcdonnell\">John McDonnell</a>, and their relentless self-eulogising blather.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The blood turned to ice as Corbyn said: 'My voice will not be stilled. I\u2019ll be around\u2026 I\u2019ll be arguing.'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52048213\">recent interview</a>, Corbyn asserted that the government\u2019s response to coronavirus proved him \u201cabsolutely right\u201d about public spending. (I\u2019m no Tory, but since when did acute emergency measures prove anybody\u2019s point?) He also complained yet again about media abuse. Dude, seriously, it\u2019s part of the job! The way Corbyn goes on, you\u2019d think all previous opposition leaders were transported into election campaigns reclining upon velvet cushions, fanned with ostrich feathers by an adoring, indulgent media.</p> <p>At Corbyn\u2019s final PMQs, Boris Johnson paid tribute to his \u201csincerity\u201d. Corbyn bristled, and quite right too: Johnson should have thanked him properly for enabling the huge Tory majority. However, the blood turned to ice as Corbyn said: \u201cMy voice will not be stilled. I\u2019ll be around\u2026 I\u2019ll be arguing.\u201d Yes, Jeremy, but arguing with whom? The Tories, or the next leader of the Labour party?</p> <p>So people like me might as well pack away the bunting \u2013 whisper it with dread: <em>Corbyn isn\u2019t going anywhere</em>. It\u2019s bad enough that we\u2019re going to have to keep putting up with his unique brand of peevish moral superiority \u2013 far worse is the now turbo-boosted entitlement he clearly feels to make the next Labour leader\u2019s life a living hell. Where\u2019s the justification? Corbyn had his chances \u2013 losing two elections. He should have the grace to pipe down. That the chances of him doing so are vanishingly small says it all about this self-styled humble servant of the people. Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely\u2026 and losing power can turn you into a sour, embittered Yesterday\u2019s Man.</p> <h2><strong>Kim, you\u2019re just what we need: a laugh in the time of corona</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51920088ac7b44a4885ca9f2bd1c74d9e7ca46bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51920088ac7b44a4885ca9f2bd1c74d9e7ca46bb/0_61_1593_955/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kim Kardashian West with her hair in many long plaits\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kim Kardashian West at Paris Fashion Week 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Fisher/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Joan Crawford died, her rival Bette Davis intoned: \u201cYou should never say bad things about the dead, only good\u2026 Joan Crawford is dead. Good.\u201d Is this the lifelong <em>froideur</em> we have to look forward to with Kim Kardashian and Taylor Swift, now that their ancient ding-dong has been reprised?</p> <p>Recap: in 2016, Kardashian\u2019s husband, Kanye West, released the song Famous, containing the lyric \u201cI feel like me and Taylor might still have sex. Why? I made that bitch famous\u201d, referring to his on-stage interruption of Swift at the 2009 MTV awards. When Swift objected to \u201cbitch\u201d, he said she\u2019d given him permission over the phone, leading Kardashian to release a recording of Swift apparently doing just that.</p> <p>Now it emerges that Kardashian trimmed the recording and permission wasn\u2019t given. Swift acknowledged this development, but urged her fans to focus on a hunger relief charity. Kardashian wasn\u2019t quite so full of grace, spraying around tweets calling Swift a liar, then announcing: \u201cThis will be the last time I speak on this because, honestly, nobody cares.\u201d</p> <p>Not so fast, Kim. Right now, under lockdown, like many others running out of amusing cat photos to post online, I\u2019m prepared to \u201ccare\u201d about all kinds of doo-dah. Indeed, however this spat ends, I\u2019d like to thank Ms Kardashian for her lack of self-awareness. It\u2019s impressive that her levels of self-absorption can\u2019t even be halted by a pandemic.</p> <p>Right now, in the \u201ccovidiot\u201d era, questions are being asked about what we really want from celebrities. Sometimes, the honest answer is <em>this</em>: monstrous out-of-control egos making fools of themselves.

Ha ha ha! Amateurs!</p> <p>People across the land seem to be finding out that working from home isn\u2019t the cushy number it\u2019s made out to be. It\u2019s not just about typing in your pyjamas (though obviously that\u2019s a major perk). As all we seasoned home-workers know, the needs of the house, and its occupants, tend to seep osmosis-style into your personal workspace. Show me the child who cares one jot about your deadlines.

  "<p>More than 35,000 badgers were killed during last year\u2019s cull, according to long overdue figures slipped out by the government on Friday at the height of the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>The total has dismayed animal rights campaigners, who claim that for the first time <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/11/badger-cull-england-extended\">since the cull was introduced in 2013</a>, more badgers were shot last year than cattle were slaughtered because they have bovine-TB.</p> <p>Dominic Dyer, the chief executive of the Badger Trust, said: \u201cThe government licensed the killing of 35,034 badgers in 2019 in 40 culling zones stretching from Cornwall to Cumbria in the largest destruction of a protected species in living memory.\u201d</p> <p>More than 70% of the badgers (24,645) were killed as a result of controlled shooting.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/30/covert-footage-reveals-cruelty-of-badger-culls\">method of killing</a> which is condemned by the British Veterinary Association as inhumane as it can result in badgers taking more than five minutes to die from multiple bullet wounds, blood loss and organ failure,\u201d Dyer said.</p> <p>Only 149 (0.6%) of the total 35,034 badgers killed were monitored to establish that they were dispatched humanely.</p> <p>The total number of badgers killed since the cull policy started now stands at 102,349. It has been estimated that the cull has cost the taxpayer more than \u00a360m.</p> <p>The figures were supposed to have been published months ago but were delayed as the efficacy of the government\u2019s policy came in for criticism.</p> <p>\u201cBadgers are now being slaughtered at such a rate across England that they could face local extinction in areas of the country which they have inhabited since the Ice Age,\u201d Dyer said.</p> <p>\u201cDespite this mass destruction of a protected species, the government has failed to produce any reliable evidence to prove that the culling of badgers is making any significant impact on lowering bovine-TB in cattle in or around the cull zones.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/05/badger-cull-phased-out-replaced-vaccinations-bovine-tb-england\">'Seismic shift\u2019: ministers signal end of badger cull</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In response to an independent review into its TB policy, the government recently acknowledged that the mass slaughter of badgers was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/05/badger-cull-phased-out-replaced-vaccinations-bovine-tb-england\">not a long-term solution</a> to reducing bovine-TB. Instead there is to be a new emphasis on vaccinating cattle against the disease.</p> <p>But farmers insist a cull is necessary. The <a href=\"https://www.nfuonline.com/sectors/animal-health/animal-health-rh-panel/bovine-tb/\">National Farmers Union</a> has expressed frustration that culling and badger vaccination are being given a \u201cfalse equivalence\u201d. The NFU said vaccination had never been demonstrated to reduce bovine-TB with the same efficacy as culling.</p> <p>Following the change in government policy, the NFU deputy president, Stuart Roberts, said: \u201cIn areas where TB in badgers is endemic, we must retain culling as a vital tool enabling industry to get on top of the disease quickly and reduce further transmission.\u201d</p> <p>A Defra spokesperson said: \u201cBovine TB leads to the slaughter of over 30,000 cattle every year and considerable trauma for farmers as they suffer the loss of highly prized animals and valued herds. As independent research has shown, the badger cull has led to a significant reduction in the disease but no one wants to continue the cull of this protected species forever. We recently set out the next phase of our strategy to combat bTB, which includes field trials of a cattle vaccine, plans to vaccinate more badgers against the disease and improved testing to intercept bTB earlier.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 30 March 2020 to include a comment from Defra.</p>",

  "<p>The global impact of the coronavirus pandemic poses a fundamental question: is this one of those historic moments when the world changes permanently, when the balance of political and economic power shifts decisively, and when, for most people, in most countries, life is never quite the same again?</p> <p>Put more simply, is this the end of the world as we know it? And, equally, could the crisis mark a new beginning?</p> <p>Genuinely pivotal global moments, watersheds or turning points (pick your own terminology) are actually quite rare. Yet if the premise is correct \u2013 that there can be no return to the pre-Covid-19 era \u2013 then it poses many unsettling questions about the nature of the change, and whether it will be for better or worse.</p> <p>For countless individuals and families, normal life has already been upended in previously unimaginable ways. But how will the pandemic influence the future behaviour of nation states, governments and leaders \u2013 and their often dysfunctional relationships? Will they work together more closely, or will this shared trauma further divide them?</p> <p>Some analysts see grounds for optimism, for example in beneficial environmental effects in northern Italy and China. Countries hitherto at odds, such as Iran and the UAE, are cooperating, at least temporarily. In the Philippines, the crisis prompted a ceasefire with Communist rebels. Global interdependence and the importance of collective, multilateral approaches have been vividly underscored.</p> <p>But there is also a more pessimistic view, typified by Stephen Walt, professor of international relations at Harvard University. \u201cThe pandemic will strengthen the state and reinforce nationalism. Governments of all types will adopt emergency measures to manage the crisis, and many will be loath to relinquish these new powers when the crisis is over,\u201d he wrote in <em><a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/20/world-order-after-coroanvirus-pandemic/\">Foreign Policy</a></em><a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/20/world-order-after-coroanvirus-pandemic/\"> </a>magazine.</p> <p>Walt continued: \u201cCovid-19 will also accelerate the shift in power and influence from west to east. The response in Europe and America has been slow and haphazard by comparison [with China, South Korea and Singapore], further tarnishing the aura of the western \u2018brand\u2019\u2026 We will see a further retreat from hyper-globalisation, as citizens look to national governments to protect them and as states and firms seek to reduce future vulnerabilities.</p> <p>\u201cIn short, Covid-19 will create a world that is less open, less prosperous and less free.\u201d</p> <p>Is Walt right? The cop-out answer is only time will tell. Yet the outcome is not preordained. The responses of everybody, from presidents and prime ministers to ordinary citizens, to the myriad challenges and upheavals arising from the pandemic will help determine what happens next.</p> <p>It\u2019s a chance to reset both global and personal landscapes. Notwithstanding present feelings of powerlessness, there are choices to be made about what kind of future awaits. After Covid-19, everything could be up for grabs.</p> <h2>Balance of power</h2> <p>After early blunders, China\u2019s government is working hard to turn Covid-19, first detected in Wuhan in November, into a national success story. It claims draconian measures to suppress the disease have largely worked. Now, by offering assistance to Italy and other badly affected countries, China is reinforcing its credentials as a global leader. The virus has become a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/china-prepares-to-seal-itself-off-from-the-world-to-stem-imported-coronavirus-cases\">soft power tool</a> to overtake its superpower rival, the US.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If the US remains absent without leave, China may take the crisis as an opportunity to start setting new rules</p> <footer> <cite>Mira Rapp-Hooper, US Council on Foreign Relations</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cA critical part of this narrative is Beijing\u2019s supposed success in battling the virus. A steady stream of propaganda articles, tweets and public messaging, in a wide variety of languages, touts China\u2019s achievements and highlights the effectiveness of its model of domestic governance,\u201d wrote commentators Kurt Campbell and Rush Doshi in <em><a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2020-03-18/coronavirus-could-reshape-global-order\">Foreign Affairs</a></em> magazine.</p> <p>In contrast, Donald Trump is struggling to dispel a widespread perception of gross incompetence. \u201cThe US government\u2019s pandemic leadership has been its own special brand of catastrophe\u2026. [It] has placed its own citizens in unnecessary peril, while sidelining itself from acting as a global crisis leader,\u201d wrote Mira Rapp-Hooper of the US Council on Foreign Relations.</p> <p>\u201cThis domestic and international governance crisis could change the nature of the international order in several ways \u2026. If the US remains absent without leave, China may take the crisis as an opportunity to start setting new rules according to its own global governance vision,\u201d she continued.</p> <h2>Authoritarianism and democracy</h2> <p>China\u2019s challenge to US hegemony was already strengthening on many fronts before the Covid-19 crisis erupted. The pandemic may accelerate this shift. For US-allied democracies that value open governance, civil rights and free speech, this is a worrying prospect.</p> <p>The trend towards centralised, authoritarian rule evident in countries such as India, Brazil and Turkey, and typified by China and Russia, has coincided with the rise of rightwing nationalist-populist governments and parties in Europe. Some are now following China\u2019s lead in attempting to weaponise the virus for political ends.</p> <p>\u201cThe pandemic unquestionably presents an era-defining challenge to public health and the global economy [but] its political consequences are less well-understood,\u201d the independent monitor, International Crisis Group, warned last week. \u201cUnscrupulous leaders may exploit the pandemic to advance their objectives in ways that exacerbate domestic or international crises \u2013 cracking down on dissent at home or escalating conflicts with rival states \u2013 on the assumption that they will get away with it while the world is otherwise occupied,\u201d the ICG said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f677aaf7e4b2682a6d53d427c63656cd83d2c64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f677aaf7e4b2682a6d53d427c63656cd83d2c64/0_316_4928_2958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, may be tempted to use the pandemic to keep his country in a state of emergency.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Isopix/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One example cited by the report was Vladimir Putin\u2019s recent attempt to indefinitely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/18/putin-criminal-incompetent-president-enemy-of-his-own-people-russia\">extend his presidency</a> in Russia (although the virus has since forced him to postpone a vote that could have allowed him to stay in power until 2036). Another was a bid by Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Hungary\u2019s nationalist leader, to renew a state of emergency \u201cthat prescribes five-year prison sentences for those disseminating false information or obstructing the state\u2019s crisis response.\u201d </p> <p>Governments such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/egypt-forces-guardian-journalist-leave-coronavirus-story-ruth-michaelson\">Egypt</a>\u2019s have followed China\u2019s example in expelling foreign journalists, restricting media access and curtailing public discussion. Like Boris Johnson and many European leaders, Trump has also assumed emergency powers. From Bolivia, India, Sri Lanka and Iraq to the US, UK and France, elections have been postponed, parliaments suspended, and lockdowns and curfews imposed.</p> <p>Most people may support such measures in the short term. But what if the crisis is protracted, with a \u201csecond wave\u201d running into next year? And what if the new controls are not relaxed or withdrawn after it ends? This is what Harvard\u2019s Stephen Walt meant about the danger of \u201cless free\u201d post-pandemic societies.</p> <h2>Globalisation and multilateralism</h2> <p>Unprecedented government aid packages for businesses and workers, intended to mitigate the disease\u2019s economic and financial impact, have led some analysts to suggest \u201cthe state is back\u201d \u2013 and that the limits of the postwar neoliberal, free market model have finally been reached.</p> <p>What the crisis has shown, it is argued, is that when the challenge is truly existential, only the state can offer holistic and equitable solutions. A natural corollary is that the high-water mark of globalisation has arrived. These are radical paradigm shifts. Will they endure?</p> <p>\u201cThe pandemic could be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back of economic globalisation,\u201d wrote Robin Niblett, director of the Chatham House thinktank. The architecture of global economic governance established in the 20th century was at risk, he warned, raising the prospect that political leaders may \u201cretreat into overt geopolitical competition\u201d.</p> <p>For Robert Kaplan of the Eurasia Group, \u201ccoronavirus is the historical marker between the first phase of globalisation and the second \u2026. Globalisation 2.0 is about separating the globe into great-power blocs with their own burgeoning militaries and separate supply chains, about the rise of autocracies, and about social and class divides that have engendered nativism and populism \u2026. In sum, it is a story about <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-20/coronavirus-ushers-in-the-globalization-we-were-afraid-of?srnd=opinion\">new and re-emerging global divisions</a>.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The pandemic is a powerful reminder of two things: the shared challenges of our global village, and the deep inequalities we must grapple with to fight them</p> <footer> <cite>David Miliband, International Rescue Committee</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If that\u2019s true, few will mourn the passing of the globalisation era. And support for Kaplan\u2019s theory may be found in increased post-pandemic protectionism if, as some predict, countries attempt to limit future exposure to global threats. The UN warned last week of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-measures-could-cause-global-food-shortage-un-warns\">worldwide food shortages</a> caused by lack of workers, tougher immigration controls, sanctions and tariffs \u2013 and called for a new, more open approach.</p> <p>The weakening of multilateral forums and institutions, evident before the crisis, is another sign of a shrinking world. Trying to revive their collective clout, the wealthy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/g20-hold-emergency-video-summit-discuss-coronavirus\">G20 countries belatedly pledged</a> last week to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to fight the virus. But it remains largely unclear what that entails in practice, and who will take the lead.</p> <h2>Fragile world</h2> <p>The pandemic and its aftermath could be a game-changer for poorer countries with limited resources and means of recovery, and for refugees and people in conflict zones \u2013 but probably not in a good way.</p> <p>The ICG report is blunt: \u201cThe global outbreak has the potential to wreak havoc in fragile states [and] trigger widespread unrest \u2026. If the disease spreads in densely packed urban centres, it may be virtually impossible to control.\u201d This is precisely the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/coronavirus-cases-africa-pass-amid-fears-health-services-south-who\">fear stalking South Africa\u2019s townships</a> right now.</p> <p>The report said the dramatic global economic slowdown would disrupt trade flows and create unemployment in commodity-exporting poorer countries. \u201cIts implications are especially serious for those caught in the midst of conflict if, as seems likely, the disease disrupts humanitarian aid flows, limits peace operations, and postpones diplomacy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0190375cc052fc870ba3abadb496e02bb8a77caa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0190375cc052fc870ba3abadb496e02bb8a77caa/0_212_3200_1921/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Displaced Syrians wait for hot meal in Idlib, Syria, last month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Displaced Syrians wait for hot meal in Idlib, Syria, last month. The pandemic and global economic slowdown will make life in conflict zones even harder.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Burak Kara/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>War-afflicted Syrians, Afghans, Somalis, South Sudanese and Yemenis could be especially badly affected. That\u2019s why the UN last week launched an appeal for $2bn in humanitarian aid. Its secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, wants trillions more in global financial stimulus to prevent \u201cmillions\u201d of deaths. \u201cCovid-19 is threatening the whole of humanity and the whole of humanity must fight back,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe pandemic is a powerful reminder of two things: the shared challenges of our global village, and the deep inequalities we must grapple with to fight them,\u201d said David Miliband, who heads the International Rescue Committee. \u201cCoronavirus is not just a problem for rich countries. We are only as strong as our weakest health system.\u201d</p> <p>Whether the international community heeds this and similar calls will be a key test.</p> <h2>Resilience and paranoia</h2> <p>The crisis has exposed an endemic lack of resilience, symbolised by chronically under-resourced healthcare systems in even better-off countries. The decision of many governments to call in the armed forces to help with logistics and manpower partly reflects fears that weakening social cohesion may lead to disorder on the streets.</p> <p>\u201cIf governments have to resort to using paramilitary or military forces to quell, for example, riots or attacks on property, societies could begin to disintegrate. Thus the main, perhaps even the sole objective of economic policy today [rather than supporting financial markets] should be to prevent social breakdown,\u201d wrote Branko Milanovi\u0107, a professor at the London School of Economics.</p> <p>Yet, looked at differently, this kind of national mobilisation can be seen as a positive development rather than a threat to civil liberties \u2013 and as a more beneficial use of military power. In Britain as elsewhere, the call to arms has created new legions of NHS volunteers. This renewed sense of national sharing and identity is a much-needed antidote to the regressive nationalism of recent years.</p> <p>\u201cLooking ahead, governments will have to decide whether to support more cooperative approaches to handling the crisis, not only in global public health terms but also as a political and security challenge,\u201d the ICG said. \u201cAll leaders face pressure to focus on domestic priorities, and in particular to ignore conflict risks in weak states \u2026. But there will be a day after.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It's possible that, over the longer term, democracies will come out of their shells to find a new type of pragmatic internationalism</p> <footer> <cite>John Ikenberry, Princeton University</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While there is concern the pandemic could deepen divisions between countries and, for example, exacerbate anti-migrant sentiment, there is a fighting chance it will boost international cooperation, support for the UN, and a willingness to pursue dialogue rather than military and economic confrontation. The future need not be a globally debilitating US-China fight for supremacy.</p> <p>Elisabeth Braw of the Royal United Services Institute warns of a moment of extreme geopolitical vulnerability. \u201cThe coronavirus is a perfect opportunity for the west\u2019s adversaries to watch how countries cope \u2013 or don\u2019t cope \u2013 with a major crisis,\u201d she wrote. But John Ikenberry, professor of international affairs at Princeton University, is less fearful, pointing to the US-led recovery after the 1930s Depression.</p> <p>Intensifying great power rivalry in a fractured, damaged, poorer world might indeed be the future that awaits, Ikenberry suggested. But it was equally possible that, \u201cover the longer term, the democracies will come out of their shells to find a new type of pragmatic and protective internationalism\u201d.</p> <p>In other words, after the nightmare, a fresh start.</p> <h2>Five events that changed the modern world</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9dd28d22659352ae446b264ee8bef0556f913bbf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9dd28d22659352ae446b264ee8bef0556f913bbf/0_129_4065_2440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The installation of ceramic poppies at the Tower of London in 2014 that marked the centenary of the outbreak of the first world war.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Never again: Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red, the ceramic poppies at the Tower of London that marked the centenary of the outbreak of the first world war.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The Versailles peace conference<br></strong>The 1919-20 conference that followed the first world war was a historic turning point. It marked the formal demise of the German, Russian and Austro-Hungarian empires, the advance of democratic, representative governance in Europe, and the start of what came to be known as the American or transatlantic century.</p> <p><strong>The Great Depression<br></strong>The Great Depression, the biggest worldwide economic calamity of the 20th century, began in the US in 1929 after the Wall Street crash. In the ensuing three years, global GDP fell by about 15% (compared with under 1% in the 2008-09 Great Recession). Things did not really pick up again until the second world war \u2013 a drastic remedy.</p> <p><strong>The battle of Stalingrad<br></strong>Fought on the banks of the Volga in southern Russia in 1942-43, the close to seven-month battle, the biggest in history, proved to be a pivotal moment in the second world war in Europe. For the first time, Hitler\u2019s armies were halted and beaten, and the myth of German invincibility destroyed. About 2 million combatants died.</p> <p><strong>The fall of the Berlin Wall<br></strong>The peaceful fall in 1989 of the Berlin Wall, the actual and symbolic dividing line between the Soviet bloc and the west, in effect ended the 44-year-long cold war. The ensuing implosion of the Soviet Union triggered the collapse of Russian-backed regimes around the world, leading the US to proclaim itself the sole global superpower.</p> <p><strong>The 9/11 attacks<br></strong>The attacks launched by al-Qaida on New York and Washington DC in September 2001 punctured American illusions of invulnerability and prompted George W Bush to declare a \u201cglobal war on terror\u201d.

  "<p> \u201cIt was about the beginning of September, 1664, that I, among the rest of my neighbours, heard in ordinary discourse, that the plague was returned again in Holland... \u201d So begins <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/aug/01/plague-fiction-writers-infectious-disease\">Daniel Defoe\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/aug/01/plague-fiction-writers-infectious-disease\">A Journal of the Plague Year</a></em>.</p> <p>It was about the beginning of 2020 that I heard a new plague was heading this way from China. On the morning of 27 February I sat with my wife Jenny in a cafe in La Caleta, a pretty fishing village in Tenerife, which we were leaving to go home to London later that day. But for the <em>calima</em>, when wild winds lifted the Sahara and deposited it on our living-room floor, we\u2019d been enjoying glorious weather. This morning was cruelly beautiful. We didn\u2019t want to leave. But while there had been only one reported case of coronavirus on the island, we weren\u2019t entirely convinced the authorities were on top of it; we weren\u2019t sure how well-equipped for dealing with a severe outbreak they were; and we thought that if it did come to hospitalisation, at least in London we spoke the language. We no sooner took that decision than we regretted it. A sadness settled on us \u2013 a calima of the spirits \u2013 that hasn\u2019t lifted.</p> <p>A plane is not a comfortable place to be when the proximity of other people makes you anxious. This was early in the scare and no one was talking yet of social distancing let alone isolation, but I am a social distancer by instinct. The immigration hall at Gatwick was deserted. Once clear of customs, I bought the first English paper I\u2019d read in days. \u201cUK warns against mass panic as race to halt outbreak intensifies,\u201d the Guardian proclaimed. So that was what we\u2019d left the silvery-sweet air of La Caleta for: mass panic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2abe7fc0863bb46462a21eafc4c8f9ce410ad658\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2abe7fc0863bb46462a21eafc4c8f9ce410ad658/0_1068_4328_2597/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Howard Jacobson, photographed at his home in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Howard Jacobson, photographed at his home in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The next day we meet friends down from Manchester for lunch.

At the next table people in their 20s are hugging and kissing.</p> <p>Jenny shops for sanitising gels and wipes only to discover when she gets them home that they are the wrong gels and wipes. We aren\u2019t killing bacteria, we are killing a virus. I don\u2019t want to admit I don\u2019t know the difference. Something\u2019s got it in for us. Who cares what it\u2019s called. But details matter. To be effective against the virus, sanitisers have to be 60% alcohol. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I just breathe on every surface,\u201d I joke.

However little she knows, I know still less.</p> <p>But it increases my sadness to be given this reminder of the ingenuity of human playfulness and desire, and to think how our incorrigible variety is being brought low, robbed of its virtuosity and joy, reduced to a single pitch of panic, by a virus. It is absurd to anthropomorphise Covid-19, but like all pestilence it is puritanical in intent. Its purpose is to flatten us out.</p> <p>The infected rate continues to rise. We have to be told, but I\u2019d still prefer not to know. Let the dead number the dead. I ring my sister in Manchester to see how she and my 97-year-old mother are getting on. Fine. Fine? Yes, fine. \u201cWhat will be will be,\u201d my sister says. We grew up in the same house: where the hell did she learn that philosophy?</p> <p>I have taken to wearing gloves when I venture out but get confused as to whether I need to keep them on or take them off to touch my face. If I\u2019ve sanitised my hands before putting on gloves, does that mean the gloves are sanitised from the inside? Or will they have contaminated my hands? I drop my bottle of gel and don\u2019t know whether to pick it up gloved or ungloved. I look around to see who\u2019s witnessing this sad fiasco. No one is. The streets are empty.</p>",

And this question that keeps coming to us from various places: is Australia ready? Is the healthcare system ready? </p> \n   <p>Well, I can really assure people that the healthcare system in Australia is very adaptable. And it is absolutely ready for this matter. In terms of intensive care, we have doubled the capacity ... and there are beds available right now with the ventilators right now to deal with people if they require it. [Intensive care] is a very small component of those now 3,400 cases in Australia, as I mentioned. Only 30 in total. And less than that currently. </p> \n   <p>We will not be seeing a peak on the 10 April, as has been reported in some places. That is not the case. The other matter I would refer to, just in terms of cruise ships, there is an emerging issue off the coast of Western Australia at the moment in relation to several cruise ships, two in particular.<br></p> \n   <p>One is a local ship, the Vasco Da Gama. The other is the Artania, which mainly has people from Germany. There are people with Covid-19 on that ship and we are working as a federal government with the WA government very closely, as well as with the German government, to repatriate anyone who is fit to fly back to Germany and other places in Europe tomorrow.

Now we\u2019ve come up with the strategy of making sure those targeted businesses \u2013 all whom can apply from Monday this week for these grants \u2013 the aim will be to ensure that the first part of that $500m package of support for smaller payroll businesses will apply.<br></p> \n   <p>These grants are for small business only.

  "<h2>Island of Ponza, Italy</h2> <p>As fate would have it, I arrived back in my tiny Venice apartment on 8 March, the day the city was locked down. Since then, restrictions have become increasingly \u2013 and rightly \u2013 more stringent, so today I can only go 200 metres outside, apart from a trip to the shops. Luckily I have a great view over the city from my rooftop terrace. From there, I can sit and dream of places I\u2019ll revisit when I have the chance. Top of the list is the tiny island of Ponza, 20 miles off the west coast between Rome and Naples in the turquoise Tyrrhenian Sea. Getting there is no easy task, but with minimum carbon footprint, I enjoyed a memorable journey: a scenic train ride across Italy from my home in Venice down to Formia, boarding an antiquated ferry, then slowly chugging into Ponza\u2019s harbour, a mass of bobbing boats surrounded by rising tiers of pastel-coloured houses, as the setting sun lit up the sky in a blaze of colours.</p> <p>Everyone in the main town seems to offer genuine family B&amp;B accommodation, and our host, Gino Pesce, also had the perfect name for his fish restaurant, <a href=\"https://www.acquapazza.com/\">Acqua Pazza</a> (crazy water). Sitting down for dinner, a fisherman walked in carrying a crate of wriggling giant red prawns, the speciality of these waters. Simply cooked by Gino\u2019s mamma in a rich tomato and olive sauce, they were served on a bed of homemade tagliatelle, and I have honestly never tasted anything so fresh, so succulent.</p> <p>Each day is a different adventure on this wild volcanic island that is five miles long and never more than a mile and a half wide. There is hardly a car to be seen, and while hiring a bike is fun, the roads are hilly and very windy, so mostly we set off on the excellent local bus and then hiked through the mountainous countryside, where steep paths along brilliant white, jagged cliffs lead down to idyllic narrow inlets and hidden bays. The best experience was going out for the day with a fisherman, mooring in a deserted creek with not another soul in sight, then plunging into the crystal clear water surrounded by shoals of multicoloured fish.</p> <p>Ponza is invaded in July and August, so I dream of going back there when flowers are budding in springtime or when the vineyards are ready for harvest in autumn.<br><strong>John Brunton, Venice</strong></p> <h2><br>Els Ports de Beseit, Aragon, Spain</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"56643f573fa285e0281844ec79199eec59b3b8a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56643f573fa285e0281844ec79199eec59b3b8a6/0_0_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matarranya Apicture taken 12 years ago that shows writer Stephen Burgen\u2019s son Louis jumping into the pool.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stephen Burgen\u2019s son leaps into a natural pool in the Els Ports in a picture taken 12 years ago.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Burgen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I mostly work from home, so in many ways the lockdown has affected me less than others but, like most homeworkers, I need to get out for some exercise. Mostly I walk, and that\u2019s what I crave right now, a long walk in wild countryside. And if I could choose one place, it would be Els Ports de Beseit.</p> <p>Els Ports is a range of limestone hills and canyons that straddles the border between Aragon and Catalonia. My favourite walk is El Parrizal de Beseit, a 20km round trip up the gorge carved out by the Matarranya River.</p> <p>There is a harsh, almost forbidding beauty about the place, like much of Aragon, a part of Spain I\u2019ve always been a bit in love with, where delightful villages appear in the midst of inhospitable landscape or on inaccessible mountain tops.</p> <p>The walk begins at the village of Beseit and follows the course of the Matarranya. It starts out flat but gradually you are funnelled upwards into the narrowing gorge, the river rushing and gurgling alongside the whole way. The sense of scale is so vast it feels like Colorado or Arizona.</p> <p>Wooden bridges cross the river, and in places there are walkways fixed to the side of the gorge. It\u2019s not a tough walk \u2013 I\u2019ve done it with children \u2013 but this is real wilderness; wander off and you might never find your way back. And it\u2019s tough enough to feel you deserve a plunge into the deep, green pool that awaits near the end of the journey.</p> <p>The water is always shockingly cold, even in August, but right now, mothballed at home and restless as a rattlesnake, I can think of nothing more satisfying than throwing myself into the cold, dark waters of the Matarranya.<br><strong>Stephen Burgen, Barcelona </strong><br></p> <h2><strong>Gori\u0161ka Brda, Slovenia</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"78ca25d4060ec767b6640cd156522e3d75424968\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78ca25d4060ec767b6640cd156522e3d75424968/0_3_5006_3003/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Slovenia, Goriska Brda\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">ia, Goriska Brda, views from near Medana</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dorling Kindersley/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a sun-soaked corner in the far west of Slovenia, where Hemingway set A Farewell to Arms<em> </em>and where the border was drawn with Italy after the first world war. Gori\u0161ka Brda is Slovenia\u2019s cradle of wine. It is actually a cluster of many tiny villages embowered by the Alps to the north and the Adriatic to the south, each photogenically situated upon soft-rolled hilltops and flysch soil, with a unique terroir that has been named one of the best in the world for white wine.</p> <p>I was there last summer to participate in a professional wine tasting. The <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/KruhInVino/posts/552145958539646\">Rebula Masterclass</a> is an annual event held at the elegant palace of Vila Vipol\u017ee, an elegant palace, that brings together nearly 100 of the world\u2019s leading wine professionals to sample an indigenous wine varietal of international renown. Rebula grapes (called ribolla gialla a few paces away in Italy) produce an umami, mineral white that has the complexity of a red.</p> <p>Or so I was told. I didn\u2019t really know what I was doing. I was the only novice at the masterclass, seated between the editor of a wine magazine and the oenologist of a Chilean winery. I wasn\u2019t even sure what the ominous-looking black buckets were for (spittoons). But the wines were wonderful. All 15 of them. Before lunch. My favourite was Rebula Journey from the <a href=\"https://www.medot-wines.com/\">Medot vineyard</a>, which is the family estate of Zvonimir Sim\u010di\u010d, a local and wine world legend.</p> <p>Sim\u010di\u010d set up <a href=\"https://klet-brda.si/en/\">Klet Brda</a> here, the largest winery in former Yugoslavia, which still produces millions of bottles a year. It is thanks to him that Gori\u0161ka Brda rose from an idyllic but impoverished region to international prominence for wine of the highest quality. It is where in-the-know locals and tourists come for lavish but low-key wine tastings, an ideal wine trail off the beaten track. In these quarantine days, I fondly remember that masterclass, the sun pouring through those buttery rebulas, and I look forward to revisiting Slovenia\u2019s land of the golden wine when circumstances allow.

It\u2019s a place this 21st-century British resident of Belgium would like to revisit.</p> <p>Belgium closed its schools, bars and restaurants on 16 March. This was followed two days later with a decision to close all stores other than chemists and food shops. We were told to stay at home as much as possible and to limit our use of public transport. All of which means that the 80 miles separating Brussels from Spa, in the French-speaking east of the country, now feels a very long way. Prosecco and strawberries at the <a href=\"https://www.thermesdespa.com/home/\">hilltop thermal baths</a>, always beautiful, now seems as distant a prospect as lobster in Manhattan\u2019s Grand Central Oyster Bar. The Belgian town\u2019s eccentric museum of laundry (<a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/museedelalessive/\">Mus\u00e9e de la lessive</a>) almost acquires the remote glamour of The Met.</p> <p>Spa is easy to love. The mineral water baths are surrounded by spectacular countryside walks. <a href=\"http://www.latonnellerie.be/en/le_restaurant.htm\">La Tonnellerie</a>, right next to the funicular up the steep central hill, will give you a cosy room and excellent food. It\u2019s a sleepy provincial spot, with few if any big-name chain shops, where many restaurants close early in the evening. I\u2019ve made the easy train trip from Brussels with my husband many times, when we needed a physical or psychological pick-me-up. Next time we\u2019ll take our toddler daughter, Marianne, to try the open-air pools and woodland.</p> <p>The Belgian town of Spa gave its name to all subsequent spa resorts.

Since then I\u2019ve mostly stayed home, missing the mountains where I\u2019ve had so many adventures in the seven years I\u2019ve lived here.</p> <p>Back in 2013, I\u2019d only recently moved to Switzerland and was desperate to explore. It was a beautiful August weekend, and a savvy Swiss friend had recommended a hike to a remote cabin in the Valais. Which is how my boyfriend and I came to be on a post bus winding its way up a narrow mountain road from Sion, blasting its tuneful horn \u2013 as singsong as the Swiss-German accent \u2013 while passing through tunnels carved out of the rock, a sheer drop-off to our left.</p> <p>The destination was well worth my nail biting: <a href=\"http://www.derborence.ch/\">Derborence lake</a>, a pristine pocket of still water reflecting lush woodland and high peaks. This was the starting point for a challenging hike of five hours \u2013 more, for us, due to my less than Swiss fitness level \u2013 through meadows strewn with wildflowers, a vast glacial valley, a boulder field and large patches of snow as we trekked ever higher. This being my first visit to a <a href=\"https://www.sac-cas.ch/en/\">Swiss Alpine Club</a> hut, I didn\u2019t know that reaching them usually means tackling a final, punishingly steep ascent just when you think the end\u2019s in sight. So it was with <a href=\"https://www.sac-cas.ch/en/huts-and-tours/sac-route-portal/2147000215/mountain_hiking/\">Cabane Rambert</a>, our home for the night, strategically placed at 2,580 metres for the best view of the Valais Alps, Mont Blanc and beyond.</p> <p>As though we\u2019d stumbled into a village restaurant, rather than a high-alpine cabin hours from civilisation, the place was packed. We chatted with other hikers over a three-course dinner, diced with death to use the toilet \u2013 a wooden shack positioned over a long drop \u2013 and endured the sub-zero night air to spot shooting stars from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2018/aug/14/the-perseid-meteor-shower-in-pictures\">Perseid</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2018/aug/14/the-perseid-meteor-shower-in-pictures\"> meteor shower</a>.</p> <p>When morning came, we lingered in bright sunshine above the clouds, watching ibex grazing nearby. I captured that moment on camera and in my mind \u2013 the perfect memory of what was the best introduction to the country that is now my home.<br><strong>Caroline Bishop, Zinal</strong></p> <h2><strong>Skyros</strong><strong>, Greece</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"98f0fe4efa77d63b3c89b3e6507ba3c1081d79c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98f0fe4efa77d63b3c89b3e6507ba3c1081d79c2/0_215_4920_2952/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chora, the main settlement and capital of the island of Skyros, in Sporades complex, central Aegean sea, Greece\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Schools in Athens closed on 11 March. Over the past two weeks, life has ground to a halt. Since Monday 23 March, we are on full lockdown.</p> <p>In a world that is irrevocably changed, we all long for the unchanged. The comfort of a familiar place steeped in memories. For me, that place is Skyros \u2014 an out-of-the-way Greek island where I have spent every long, hot summer since the age of five, when my parents bought a tiny stable in the hilltop village.</p> <p>From the vine-shaded hammock on our terrace, you can see a tumble of roofs and a haze of receding hills, a solitary chapel or cypress tree. Every so often, a jangling trail of sheep plods across the horizon. Stray cats curl up under the jasmine or stretch out on the low, whitewashed wall where we drink coffee, write postcards, sketch, or toast the sunset with Camparis.</p> <p>At night, we throw rag rugs over that wall and our friends perch with plates of baked chickpeas, garlicky red peppers, and crisp triangles of cheesy filo on their laps. Friends who come from Athens, Berkeley, Copenhagen, Basel, London, New York, Lugano, Toronto, and Paris to relive the same simple rituals year after year. A far-flung community that has grown up and grown old together. Every summer, there might be a new baby, grandchild, or boyfriend; a divorce; a death. But the presence of those who are gone is all around, etched into our collective memory like the whitewash that outlines the paving stones in the village lanes. And the delicate caper blossoms that emerge miraculously from dry stone walls remind us that life goes on.</p> <p>My apartment in Athens is not much bigger than our one-room home on Skyros. Our balcony barely has enough space for two folding chairs, and our limited view is of the interior lives of our neighbours. Like moths drawn to light, they too flit aimlessly on their ledges, staring at empty streets at once familiar and foreign. Trapped inside with a young child, I dream of a different view \u2013 of sunlight dancing on vines and a distant speck of sea.<br><strong>Rachel Howard, Athens</strong></p> <h2>Colorado Proven\u00e7al, Rustrel, France</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c9e505bb72f65a64777e9db8ce13e5ffb7f8307b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9e505bb72f65a64777e9db8ce13e5ffb7f8307b/0_170_5100_3061/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Colorado Provencal, rocks of ochre under a blue sky\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Since France went into lockdown at midday on 17 March, everyone in my family has been fighting to walk Rio. The latest restriction is that we can only go outside if walking a dog or for urgent supplies, so we are longing to run free in the countryside again.</p> <p>Ten kilometres north-east of Apt, surrounded by lavender fields and fruit orchards, is the <a href=\"https://www.avignon-et-provence.com/en/natural-sites/colorado-provencal\">Colorado Proven\u00e7al</a>, a dramatic landscape of ochre quarries where I\u2019d like to be right now. More than 20 different shades of ochre were extracted at the site from the 17th century until the early 1990s, leaving a 30-hectare park of spectacular geometric and wind-eroded outcrops and canyons.</p> <p>The last time we went was in summer. We followed the Sahara pathway past soaring orange pinnacles, red pools beneath ruby and green cliff faces and <em>chemin\u00e9es des </em><em>f\u00e9es</em> (fairy chimneys, which are also known as hoodoos). It began raining, and all the different pigments ran down the earth, flooding into amber-coloured pools. The place is deceptively perilous; you have to stick to the paths or could easily plunge down a vermillion precipice or skid across an ivory and peach slope into a wilderness of broom bushes and pine trees.</p> <p>The surrounding villages have their food specialities: Banon has goat\u2019s milk cheese wrapped in chestnut leaves and spindly cured sausages called <em>brindilles</em>, which they sell in metre-long poster tubes; Saint-Saturnin-l\u00e8s-Apt is famous for its black cherries; Simiane-la-Rotonde for lavender cordial and chunky, mint-flavoured meringues. Apt is the world capital of crystallised fruit. The selection makes for a quirky picnic, but then Rustrel is the closest you can get to lunch on Mars.</p> <p>When the rain stopped, the turmeric-coloured powder turned to gold on my children\u2019s hands, and what had appeared brick-red from the roadside, left my cream chinos with a tie-dye of copper and bronze. Meanwhile, our white dog, Rio, who has spent most of his life being told to get off sofas, down from beds and out from behind cushions, leapt unscolded on to the back seat of the car shaking out his new coat of russet and purple and pink.<br><strong>Jon Bryant, Nice</strong></p> <h2>Serra da Estrela, Portugal</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9bed3cb5a863cd4a3d9126b62aed4fae81cedb35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bed3cb5a863cd4a3d9126b62aed4fae81cedb35/0_289_3662_2198/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A runner in the Serra da Estrela, Portugal\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It has been nearly two weeks since we closed the door on the outside world and hunkered down at home. As a keen runner, the fact that Portugal\u2019s emergency measures permit \u2013 for now \u2013 a brief daily run is helping keep my spirits up. I\u2019ve been going out alone, running along the empty streets in our downtown neighbourhood in Porto.</p> <p>Grateful as I am, pad-padding along the tarmac is still not a patch on trail running. Boy, how I miss the feel of earth underfoot and big skies above. If I could transport myself anywhere right now, I\u2019d flee the city and make a beeline for the isolated delights of Serra da Estrela.</p> <p>Located bang in the centre of Portugal, this sprawling, mountainous natural park is home to frothing rivers and majestic waterfalls, berry-fattened boars and all-seeing eagles. I went for a two-day bimble this time last year with my friend Patrick. A local contact cobbled together a zigzagging 90km route for us, from Seia on the park\u2019s western edge to Covilh\u00e3 on the east.</p> <p>For 36 sweaty, muscle-aching, blissful hours, we barely saw a soul. Fifteen minutes out of Seia and we were deep in classic mountain country; narrow dirt tracks, perfume-packed pine woods, the rustling of animals in the undergrowth. The ever-shifting, always-sloping landscape kept our legs in motion and our mouths agape. From arboreal foothills, we climbed up to bare, boulder-strewn plateaux, before plunging back down to shaded valleys below.</p> <p>The highlight came on the morning of the second day, as we wove our way slowly up the glacial Z\u00eazere valley, before eventually joining a hairpin road for a final, lung-bursting assault on Torre, the highest point in mainland Portugal. The ache in my legs, the wind on my face, the world at our feet: would that I were there right now.<br><strong>Oliver Balch, Porto</strong></p> <h2>Nationalpark S\u00e4chsische Schweiz, Germany</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1a989b6158c442115e6a0748c8093cee5403f176\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a989b6158c442115e6a0748c8093cee5403f176/0_444_7360_4415/1000.jpg\" alt=\"View to the Bastei rock formation at sunrise.

Although we don\u2019t have a complete lockdown like those in Spain and Italy, it\u2019s difficult not to start dreaming about an escape.</p> <p>Germany offers plenty of possibilities for a daunting dash. From the Black Forest in the south to the Baltic Sea a couple of hours north of Berlin, there are a wealth of <em>\u201csch\u00f6ne ecken\u201d</em> (beautiful corners or spots), some obvious, some hidden. But if I had to choose right now, it would be a personal favourite: the <a href=\"https://www.saechsische-schweiz.de/en/region/national-park.html\">Nationalpark S\u00e4chsische Schweiz</a> (Saxon Switzerland national park), which is as famous for needing a few schnapps to pronounce it, as it is for its natural beauty.</p> <p>The park is located east of Dresden, right on the Czech border, and is contiguous with the <a href=\"https://www.czechtourism.com/c/bohemian-switzerland-national-park/\">Bohemian Switzerland </a><a href=\"https://www.czechtourism.com/c/bohemian-switzerland-national-park/\">national </a><a href=\"https://www.czechtourism.com/c/bohemian-switzerland-national-park/\">park</a> on the other side. Getting there by train, car or bike from Berlin \u2013 I\u2019ve done all three \u2013 involves meeting and following the Elbe to one of the entry points; the pretty towns of Pirna or Bad Schandau, for example. Watching the river calmly wind its way north always makes me slowly exhale.</p> <p>I usually walk a section or two of the park\u2019s Malerweg or \u201cpainter\u2019s trail\u201d, named after its origins as a destination for the many romantic artists \u2013 Caspar David Friedrich included \u2013 who sought inspiration here. It\u2019s easy to see why they did so. An amalgam of undulating sandstone peaks, lush forests and moss-covered ravines, parts of it are utterly spectacular, not least the famous Bastei Bridge, which looks out across the wide, dreamy expanses of the Elbe valley.</p> <p>It\u2019s usually packed with tourists here as it\u2019s accessible by bus, but the rest of the trail is usually not heavily trafficked at all, especially the further you push into the park. The eight Malerweg trail stages are 10-15km long, some pretty easy-going, others quite challenging, and all weaving between quaint villages that offer overnight stays and restaurants with traditional fare like schnitzel and <em>sp\u00e4tzle</em>. They all have something of interest, from Richard Wagner memorials, old castles and medieval fortifications, to caves, grottos and even health spas. It\u2019s really like entering another world.<br><em>\u2022 </em><em><a href=\"https://www.saechsische-schweiz.de/en/region/national-park.html\">saechsische-schweiz.de</a></em><br><strong>Paul Sullivan, Berlin</strong></p> <h2>N\u00e4set beach, Sweden</h2> <p>Sweden has taken a different tack from the rest of Europe, preferring to keep primary schools open and not declare a lockdown.

The bill that was worked on in the Senate late last week was much better before Speaker Pelosi showed up to destroy it and add days and days to the process.</p> \n   <p>This bill should have been voted on much sooner in both the Senate and House and it shouldn\u2019t be stuffed full of Nancy Pelosi\u2019s pork \u2013 including $25 million for the Kennedy Center, grants for the National Endowment for the Humanities and Arts, and millions more other measures that have no direct relation to the Coronavirus Pandemic. </p> \n   <p>That $25 million, for example, should go directly to purchasing test kits. The number one priority of this bill should have been to expand testing availability and creation of tests so that every American, not just the wealthy and privileged, have access to testing. We have shut down the world\u2019s economy without adequate data. Everyone, even those with no symptoms, needs immediate access to a test. This bill creates even more secrecy around a Federal Reserve that still refuses to be audited. It allows the Federal Reserve to make decisions about who gets what, how much money we\u2019ll print. With no transparency.</p> \n   <p>If getting us into $6 trillion more debt doesn\u2019t matter, then why are we not getting $350 trillion more in debt so that we can give a check of $1 million to every person in the country?</p> \n   <p>This stimulus should go straight to the people rather than being funneled through banks and corporations like this bill is doing. 2 trillion divided by 150 million workers is about $13,333.00 per person. That\u2019s much more than the $1,200 per person check authorized by this bill.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-27T16:09:23.450Z\">at 4.09pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7e212b8f081e5eda23815f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-27T15:52:50.041Z\">3.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Trump invokes Defense Production Act in urging GM to manufacture ventilators</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Donald Trump has invoked the Defense Production Act in a series of tweets urging General Motors to take the lead in manufacturing ventilators. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1243559373395410957\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">General Motors MUST immediately open their stupidly abandoned Lordstown plant in Ohio, or some other plant, and START MAKING VENTILATORS, NOW!!!!!!

But the idea of a vaccine \u2013 the quintessential silver bullet \u2013 has come to bear an almost unreasonable allure. The coronavirus arrived at a ripe moment in genetic technology, when the advances of the past half-decade have made it possible for vaccine projects to explode off the blocks as soon as a virus is sequenced. These cutting-edge vaccines don\u2019t use weakened forms of the germ to build our immunity, as all vaccines once did; rather, they contain short copies of parts of the germ\u2019s genetic code \u2013 its DNA or RNA \u2013 which can produce fragments of the germ within our bodies.</p> \n  <p>Thus, for the first time ever, scientists have been able to muster up vaccine prospects mere weeks into a new, fast-spreading disease. Right now, there are at least 43 Covid-19 vaccines <a href=\"https://milkeninstitute.org/sites/default/files/2020-03/Covid19%20Tracker%20032020v3-posting.pdf\">in development</a> around the world \u2013 in Brisbane and Hong Kong, in the US and the UK, in the labs of universities and companies. Most of these are DNA or RNA vaccines. One vaccine, made in 63 days by an American biotech firm named Moderna, <a href=\"https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/nih-clinical-trial-investigational-vaccine-covid-19-begins\">moved into</a> human trials on 16 March, entering the bloodstream of the first of 45 healthy adult volunteers in Seattle. It was a \u201cworld indoor record\u201d, said Anthony Fauci, the doctor who heads the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. \u201cNothing has ever gone that fast.\u201d</p> \n

The idea is simple: there are businesses which will have to close their doors. They will have to keep them closed either because we have made it necessary for them to do so, or simply because there is just not the business to keep their doors open. We want those businesses to start again. And we do not want over the course of the next six months or as long as it takes, for those businesses to be so saddled by debt, so saddled by rental payments, so saddled by other liabilities that they will not be able to start again on the other side.

If you see news you think our readers should know, or something that might lower our collective stress levels for a moment, let me know on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan\">@helenrsullivan</a>. </p> \n  <p>A lot has happened in the last few hours. Here are the main developments: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The US now has the highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the world.</strong> Johns Hopkins University suggests the US now has more suspected and confirmed cases of Covid-19 than China with 82,404 reported in the US and 81,782 in China. Italy is third with 80,589.</li> \n   <li><strong>The global number of confirmed cases of coronavirus has passed the half a million mark,</strong> according to the latest figures on the Johns Hopkins University global dashboard. The latest number of confirmed cases worldwide is 529,093.</li> \n   <li><strong>Leaders of the G20 industrialised nations committed to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to minimise the social and economic damage of the world-wide pandemic.</strong> But a largely unspecific and uncontroversial joint communique set no specific commitments such as deferring debt repayment to the world\u2019s poorest countries, as sought by the World Bank and the IMF.</li> \n   <li><strong>China has announced it will close its borders to foreign nationals from this weekend</strong>. Other measures include restricting foreign airlines to a single route, with no more than one weekly flight. Each Chinese airline is permitted one route to any specific country with no more than one flight a week.</li> \n   <li><strong>South Africa came under a nationwide military-patrolled lockdown on Friday, </strong>joining other African countries imposing strict curfews and shutdowns in an attempt to halt the spread of the coronavirus across the continent.Some 57 million people are to be restricted to their homes during South Africa\u2019s three-week total lockdown which began at midnight.</li> \n   <li><strong>Brita</strong><strong>in\u2019s prime minister, Boris Johnson, called on governments around the world to work together to create a vaccine</strong> as quickly as possible and make it available to anyone who needs it.</li> \n   <li><strong>The International Monetary Fund on Thursday asked G20 leaders to back a doubling of its emergency financing capacity</strong> to strengthen its response to the rapidly spreading coronavirus pandemic that is set to cause a global recession in 2020.</li> \n   <li><strong>France </strong><strong>began evacuating coronavirus patients from Alsace using a special high-speed train.</strong> About 20 patients were taken from Strasbourg to hospitals in the Pays-de-la-Loire and other regions. The move is aimed at relieving pressure on hospitals overwhelmed in Alsace.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>The WHO said it sees \u2018encouraging signs\u2019 in Europe. </strong>The World Health Organiszation says it is encouraged by the lower rate of new infection in Italy. </li> \n   <li><strong>A slower rise in deaths was reported in Spain. </strong>Spain has announced anothera further 655 coronavirus fatalities, taking the country\u2019s total to more than 4,000. As the increase is below the daily rise recorded on Wednesday it offers support to government claims that the rise is deaths in Spain is stabilising.</li> \n   <li><strong>India announced a stimulus package. </strong>India has announced a 1.7tn-rupee (\u00a318.9bn) economic stimulus plan to millions of people, affected by a nationwide lockdown. </li> \n   <li><strong>Iran posted a record rise in cases. </strong>The health ministry confirmed another 157 deaths from the virus in the last 24 hours, taking Iran\u2019s total to 2,234 fatalities. A record 2,389 new cases had been recorded over the same period. Five days ago, the numbers being infected daily was below 900.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UK recorded its biggest daily rise in deaths.</strong> The number of people who have died from coronavirus in UK hospitals has risen by 115 in a single day to 578, as of 5pm on Thursday. It is the biggest daily rise in deaths across the country since the outbreak began.</li> \n   <li><strong>Moscow shut down as Russia banned flights. </strong>Moscow announced it would close restaurants, bars, parks, and shops other than grocery stores and pharmacies. It came as Russia posted record growth for confirmed coronavirus cases for the second day in a row.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-27T00:13:49.778Z\">at 12.13am GMT</time></p> \n</div>"
