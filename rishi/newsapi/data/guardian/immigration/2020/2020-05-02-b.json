The Randox instructions that come with the kits state: \u201cTest kits are only valid for 48 hours after use.\u201d The 29-year-old told the Guardian:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> This means there could be hundreds of useless kits sent out to workers like myself.<br></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>After calling the help centre, she was told there had been an influx of the same complaint and the advice was to order another one.</p> \n  <p>Similarly, Lou, a 31-year-old PR manager from London, was sent a kit without a return postage label enclosed. As a label couldn\u2019t be sent to her in time, Lou had a void sample and had to order a second kit to repeat the process. </p> \n  <p>Both women expressed concern over the delay in getting tested and also over whether the first testing kits they were sent would still count towards the government\u2019s daily testing figures.</p> \n  <p>The government was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/ministers-accused-of-changing-covid-19-test-tally-to-hit-100000-goal\">accused on Friday of bending the truth about how it passed its target of 100,000 tests a day</a>, amid reports that tests were being counted on dispatch rather than upon return to the lab.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/ministers-accused-of-changing-covid-19-test-tally-to-hit-100000-goal\">Hancock says UK hit 100,000 tests amid claims tally is artificially boosted</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>Jade also expressed concern that people would have trouble following the instructions to self-swab because, as she put it, testing for Covid-19 is \u201cquite invasive and very unpleasant for patients and the nurses doing it\u201d. This, she said, led her to fear many tests being sent out won\u2019t be utilised properly. </p> \n  <p>Lou said she had found the instructions \u201cexceedingly confusing\u201d and hard to follow. She said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I mainly worry for those with severe symptoms, this delay could be really damaging and also the confusing nature of the instructions make it

\u201ca significant portion of [home tests] will be useless\u201d</a> because many people will struggle to perform the test on themselves. </p> \n  <p>Dr Gary Marlowe, the London chair of the <strong>British Medical Association</strong>, said that to collect a sample of the virus, patients need to scrape a long swab against their tonsils and push it into their nose until it meets resistance, which is \u201creally uncomfortable and difficult\u201d to do.</p> \n  <p>He said the difficulties with self-swabbing \u201cmeans that there will be a significant amount of people in whom the test comes back as negative when they\u2019re actually carrying the virus\u201d.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T15:00:06.505Z\">at 4.00pm

<li>75 occurred on 1 May</li> \n   <li>149 occurred on 30 April </li> \n   <li>52 occurred on 29 April</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>The figures also show 85 of the new deaths took place between 1 and 28 April while the remaining nine deaths occurred in March, with the earliest new death taking place on 13 March.<br></p> \n  <p>NHS England releases updated figures each day showing the dates of every coronavirus-related death in hospitals in England, often including previously uncounted deaths that took place several days or even weeks ago. This is because of the time it takes for those who have died to be confirmed as testing positive for Covid-19, for postmortem examinations to be processed and for data from the tests to be validated.</p> \n  <p>The figures published today by NHS England show 8 April continues to have the highest number for the most hospital deaths occurring on a single day, with a current total of 864.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T13:58:49.428Z\">at 2.58pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ead6a8a8f087d47c778810d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T12:42:00.863Z\">1.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b717b3a661e01f436be6220e13bc494ff67082a\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b717b3a661e01f436be6220e13bc494ff67082a/0_148_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A statue by artist Ross Wilson entitled Mother Daughter Sister in Belfast is adorned with a mask and disposable gloves\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A statue by artist Ross Wilson entitled Mother Daughter Sister, celebrating female identity and culture, in Sandy Row, Belfast is adorned with a mask and disposable gloves as the UK heads towards a seventh week in lockdown.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Niall Carson/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T12:47:40.399Z\">at 1.47pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ead69f98f082b32fdd6c061\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T12:40:35.418Z\">1.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds name baby son Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Boris Johnson and his fiancee Carrie Symonds have named their baby boy Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson, after their grandfathers and the doctors who helped save the prime minister\u2019s life.</p> \n  <p>Symonds announced on Instagram:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Introducing Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson born on 29.04.20 at 9am.</p> \n   <p>Wilfred after Boris\u2019 grandfather, Lawrie after my grandfather, Nicholas after Dr Nick Price and Dr Nick Hart \u2013 the two doctors that saved Boris\u2019 life last month.</p> \n   <p>Thank you so, so much to the incredible NHS maternity team at UCLH that looked after us so well.

It found that changing the length of a lockdown \u2013 from eight to 12 or 16 weeks \u2013 would have an impact on the date at which any second wave might arrive, but only a marginal effect on the number of cases or deaths.</p> \n  <p>Another finding in the report claimed that the later a second period of lockdown was introduced \u2013 one that lasted for eight weeks \u2013 the bigger the reduction in any cases would be, compared to taking no lockdown action at all.</p> \n  <p>Communities with a younger average age of population would also extract greater benefit from a longer period of lockdown than one with an older population, according to the study. It found that any lockdown would save more lives amongst a younger community than an older one.</p> \n  <p>Dr Konstantin Blyuss, Reader in Mathematics at the University of Sussex, said: <br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Although in each case we explored, there will be a second epidemic peak after the quarantine is lifted, interestingly and quite counterintuitively, the later quarantine is introduced, the smaller this second peak will be. This reduction becomes quite substantial for quarantines introduced at a later stage.</p> \n   <p>Introducing an eight-week quarantine 10 weeks after the start of an outbreak reduces the magnitude of the peak in infected individuals by between 45% and 59% compared to no quarantine, and this reduces to only 8.5%-23.5% for a quarantine of the same duration introduced after six weeks.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Dr Yuliya Kyrychko, a reader in mathematics at the University of Sussex and one of the authors of the report, said the expanded effects of lockdown on young people could be explained by the likelihood of their being more socially mobile. She said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A bigger impact of quarantine on reducing deaths in regions with younger populations can be attributed to a number of factors, such as the fact that younger people have more contacts and thus are making a bigger contribution to disease transmission, so quarantining them makes a bigger impact on reducing the overall disease burden.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T11:55:58.255Z\">at 12.55pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ead568e8f082b32fdd6bfc1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T11:16:51.070Z\">12.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e92e93d92f2969669fa66982b2d0553ae1873e4\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e92e93d92f2969669fa66982b2d0553ae1873e4/32_114_3077_1847/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mural in tribute to the NHS painted by artist Rachel List in Pontefract.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mural in tribute to the NHS painted by artist Rachel List in Pontefract.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lee Smith/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ead55ba8f082b32fdd6bfba\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/davidbatty\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T11:14:13.904Z\">12.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jeremy-deller\">artist Jeremy Deller</a> has called on middle-aged ravers to buy a poster he has produced in recognition of the plight of victims of domestic violence and care home residents during the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"http://www.pleasedonotbend.co.uk/work/bless-this-acid-house\">Sales of the print</a>, which says Bless this Acid House, will support Refuge, a charity for survivors of domestic abuse, and Pilgrims\u2019 Friend Society, which runs care homes across the UK.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B_ra0jOlDZu/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Although a firm may be open for business, this does not mean it is business as usual.</p> \n   <p>Residential property transactions have ground to a halt. Reduction in court hearings has massively impacted on the amount of work available - while social distancing and the lack of face-to-face meetings is causing difficulty delivering in other areas, such as the execution of wills.</p> \n   <p>Elsewhere, small firms have suffered from the decline in overall activity - particularly from service industries such as retail, leisure and hospitality.</p> \n   <p>The fate of the high-street firm is thus intrinsically bound to that of other small businesses.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He said firms are struggling because although the government provides some relief, they are specifically excluded from support for small businesses, and are expected to continue paying business rates while their buildings are empty. There is therefore a growing fear that \u201cmany businesses will fall through the crack\u201d, he added.</p> \n  <p>Davis also said individual solicitors are also at risk, because some are not eligible for support for the self-employed, and those who are paid via dividends are in need of a support package.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T10:21:43.194Z\">at 11.21am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ead43238f087d47c7787fd7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/libbybrooks\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T09:56:13.263Z\">10.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>New polling shows extraordinarily high support for the SNP government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. </p> \n  <p>According to a YouGov survey for the Times Scotland, <strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong> has the confidence of 71% of Scots when it comes to her ability to make the correct decisions in dealing with the virus, with 23% saying they do not have faith in her judgments.

Holden drops a shoulder and sits down the Blackpool left-back Garrett in a style Matthews himself will surely have admired. Holden sends the ball across the face of the box. Moir swipes and misses. Hassall, on the left-hand edge of the D, takes up possession instead and thinks about shooting. But with plenty of tangerine up in his grille, he rolls the ball back across the face of the box for Holden, who tees up Lofthouse for a speculative shot. Lofthouse smears a first-time diagonal effort towards the bottom left. Farm should parry, but the ball bounces just before it reaches his hands, hops gently over them, and in! That was a fine sweeping move by Bolton, but it should never have resulted in a goal. A miserable mistake by Farm, and Bolton lead after 75 seconds. Lofthouse has now scored in every round of the cup this season!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f03455c015bcfe468e080f3763b55a4ecfca9d89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f03455c015bcfe468e080f3763b55a4ecfca9d89/0_0_2800_2093/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Farm, Blackpool\u2019s goalkeeper, looks dismayed as the Lofthouse\u2019s shot hops over him and into the net!\" width=\"1000\" height=\"748\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Farm, Blackpool\u2019s goalkeeper, looks dismayed as the Lofthouse\u2019s shot hops over him and into the net!</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T14:04:22.479Z\">at 3.04pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ead7d0c8f087d47c7788190\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T14:01:12.183Z\">3.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>1 min: </strong>Matthews takes the corner himself but it\u2019s a poor one and headed clear by Hassall.

Lofthouse scored twice in the first half from \u201cdramatic breakaways\u201d, adding to goals from Doug Holden and Willie Moir as Bolton romped into a 4-0 half-time lead. As if that wasn\u2019t bad enough for Everton, their pain was compounded as striker Dave Hickson was forced to leave the pitch concussed for 15 minutes, and Tommy Clinton skewed a penalty wide just before the break.</p> <p><strong>But the Second Division strugglers - Everton are at a low ebb right now - came roaring back at Bolton in the second period. </strong>John Willie Parker pulled one back immediately, and though Lofthouse then hit a post, Everton went on to unleash an \u201conslaught\u201d: Peter Farrell slapped home a free kick and Parker added his second and Everton\u2019s third. But luck wasn\u2019t with the Merseysiders as they tried to reach Wembley for the first time in 20 years, and Bolton held on as \u201cthe game passed beyond the frontier of the normal into the realm of pure delirium\u201d. Worth the few shillings admission, huh? Final score: Bolton Wanderers 4-3 Everton.</p> <p><strong>Meanwhile at Villa Park, Blackpool and Tottenham were playing out a mini classic of their own. </strong>Stanley Matthews set up Bill Perry for the opening goal after seven minutes. Blackpool began to dominate, Matthews totally bossing Charlie Withers, but soon enough Spurs, champions of England just two years ago, began to get a grip. Their attacks \u201cswept and flowed\u201d, according to this very paper. \u201cOne glorious move went the length of the field with the ball on the ground and not a Blackpool player touching it.\u201d Eddie Baily headed against the bar, then Len Duquemin equalised at the start of a second half that would be all Tottenham.</p> <p><strong>But George Farm was inspired in the Blackpool goal, and the score remained 1-1 until the final minute ... </strong>at which point Spurs full back Alf Ramsey attempted to calmly poke a backpass into the hands of keeper Ted Ditchburn. The attempt ended in sad farce, Ramsey allowing the ball to clank off his thigh. Jackie Mudie nipped in to score an unanswerable winner. Ramsey walked off distraught. It was the sort of mistake that could destroy a man. That\u2019ll weigh heavy on him for a long time. You wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you never hear anything of him again.

Back in the day, he used to bang them in for ... of course he did ... Bolton Wanderers. Relentlessly so: he\u2019s their all-time leading scorer with 277 goals. As club captain, he lifted the FA Cup for the Trotters after the famous White Horse Final of 1923, and again three years later. Now having moved to the coast to manage Blackpool, he\u2019s hoping to make it third time lucky with the Seasiders, having lost the finals of 1948 and 1951. If his team prevail this afternoon, against his old club, it\u2019d surely be a story for the ages!</p> <p><strong>Having said all that, quite a lot of attention is being focused on Blackpool winger Stanley Matthews. Quite. A. <em>Lot</em>. </strong>The biggest star English football has produced to date is, at the age of 38, running out of time to win the FA Cup medal that\u2019s eluded him all these years. Blackpool twice let the lead slip against Manchester United in the 1948 final, they were undone by Newcastle cup specialist Jackie Milburn three years later, and many felt that was the old boy\u2019s last chance of a medal. Unexpectedly, here comes another. He really is boozing in the last-chance saloon this time. Is the idol of English football destined to end his career with nothing tangible to show for all his talent? It\u2019s unthinkable, but this is where we are.</p> <p><strong>Problem for Matthews, Smith and Blackpool is, Bolton are currently three for three in FA Cup finals at Wembley.</strong> Admittedly all of these triumphs came in the 1920s - in addition to the aforementioned finals starring Smith, they also won in 1929 - but footballers can be a superstitious lot, and every little helps. They\u2019ve also got a player of their own to rival the star power of Matthews: Nat Lofthouse, England\u2019s <em>Lion of Vienna</em>. Lofthouse is the newly crowned Football Writers\u2019 Player of the Year. And what a year! He scored 22 goals in the First Division, six in a challenge match between the Football League and the League of Ireland, and has found the net in every round of the cup so far. He\u2019s knocking them in at a prodigious rate for both club and country. Who knows, he may one day threaten Joe Smith\u2019s club record. Good luck stopping him today.</p> <p><strong>But y\u2019know, good luck stopping both of these attacks.</strong> Matthews and Lofthouse are flanked by a top-class supporting cast: Bolton forwards Willie Moir, Harold Hassall and Bobby Langton are all internationals, while Blackpool striker Stan Mortensen has been matching Lofthouse goal for goal in an England shirt. Throw in the results of the two league encounters this season - a 3-0 win for Blackpool and a 4-0 win for Bolton - and this has the promise to be a lot of fun. Can Blackpool win their first cup, and with it that precious medal for Matthews? Or will Bolton Wanderers lift the famous pot for the fourth time and break the old boy\u2019s heart?

  "<p><strong>True Spies</strong> (podcast) | <a href=\"https://spyscape.com/podcast/true-spies\">Spyscape</a><br><strong>Floodlines </strong>(podcast) | <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/floodlines/\">The Atlantic</a> </p> <p>My listening habits have changed since the lockdown; my listening tastes, too. I find myself turning to podcasts in the evening, while the other members of my family get into other media: watching telly, making TikToks, building <em>Minecraft</em> mansions, virtually murdering friends and virtually dancing to celebrate. Still, we\u2019re all usually in the same room, so it\u2019s a kind of bonding. We\u2019re physically close, though miles apart in our minds.</p> <p>Anyhow. The podcasts I\u2019ve searched out this week have been complicated and action-packed. Tales of danger and derring-do in an old world, where people saved each other\u2019s lives through more dramatic means than texting funny memes or playing board games via Zoom. (Yes, I know these things can be vital at the moment. I just crave more\u2026 excitement.) The BBC is usually good at this type of show, but I\u2019ve binged most of its podcasts, so I was happy to hear about a new series from <a href=\"https://www.cupandnuzzle.com/\">Cup and Nuzzle</a> called <strong><a href=\"https://spyscape.com/podcast/true-spies\">True Spies</a></strong>.</p> <p>The show has been made for New York spy museum <a href=\"https://spyscape.com/\">Spyscape </a>\u2013 \u201cthe headquarters of all things spy\u201d \u2013 and the series producer is Gemma Newby, whose credits include <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000cn22\">The Ratline</a></em> for the BBC. <em>True Spies</em> has actual spies telling us about what they actually do, concentrating on a different incident each episode. Future programmes will feature undercover CIA officers, KGB double agents and Cambridge Analytica whistleblower <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/29/mindfck-christopher-wylie-targeted-brittany-kaiser-cambridge-analytica-review\">Brittany Kaiser</a>, whom regular <em>Observer</em> readers may recall. The opening show, which came out last week, was about Gad Shimron, an ex-Mossad operative (apparently, they\u2019re not called \u201cagents\u201d \u2013 \u201cit sounds like you work in insurance\u201d sniffed Shimron), and a mad 1970s tale of the rescue of Ethiopian Jewish refugees from Sudan.</p> <p>There was a lot to explain but the podcast, ably narrated by Hayley Atwell, set things up well. After Haile Selassie\u2019s Ethiopian government was overthrown in 1974, the country\u2019s Jewish citizens, known as the Beta Israel, joined the resistance against the military regime. But it eventually became too dangerous for them to remain, so they fled to refugee camps in Sudan. Some Mossad operatives agreed to rescue them. The Mossad boys set up a real diving retreat for real-life tourists (it was very successful, apparently) as a cover, and then smuggled out the refugees, initially by boat and then by plane.</p> <p>This was a gripping adventure, with jeopardy and weirdness and heart-in-the-mouth upsets. However, when a show is anchored by a single interview with a single interviewee, the pace has to be perfect, and just occasionally, Shimron\u2019s story is too complicated and the pace a teensy bit too slow. But the truthful detail is great and <em>True Spies</em> is set to be an exciting series, not least because, at certain points during the show, Atwell asks the listeners: \u201cWhat would you do?\u201d This is encouragement for the listener to check out the <a href=\"https://spyscape.com/\">Spyscape website</a>, where there are various games to assess whether or not you\u2019d make a good spy. Yes, I\u2019ve tried some of them. Apparently I\u2019m too risk-averse. The lockdown has killed my sense of adventure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"616421fc0190a2a57eadad8110f3cb61b73e904d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/616421fc0190a2a57eadad8110f3cb61b73e904d/200_735_3544_3905/908.jpg\" alt=\"Vann R Newkirk II, host of Floodlines.\" width=\"908\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vann R Newkirk II, host of Floodlines.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emily Jan for the Atlantic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another big, scary, real-life show I\u2019ve been enjoying is <strong><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/floodlines/\">Floodlines</a></strong>, from the <em>Atlantic</em>. Although \u201cenjoying\u201d isn\u2019t quite the right word. <em>Floodlines </em>tells the full story of Hurricane Katrina and New Orleans and, God, what a tragedy that story is. From the end of the first episode, one full of dread and tension, we understand that Katrina wasn\u2019t as bad as everyone feared. Although it was severe (as it approached, residents noticed that the animals fled: \u201cNo parrots, no dogs, no cats, no birds,\u201d said one), Katrina was a Category 3 hurricane, not a 5, and its worst force landed east of New Orleans, not directly on the city. But the levees still broke, the water still rose, and the people still died. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/21/us/hurricane-katrina-new-orleans-danziger-bridge-shootings.html\">Some were shot by police</a>.</p> <p>Presented by <em>Atlantic s</em>taff writer Vann R Newkirk II, <em>Floodlines</em> is impeccable, using direct testimony and archive to build to a final, devastating episode, where Newkirk talks to Michael Brown, who was a director of the Bush government\u2019s response to Katrina. Brown\u2019s inability to properly engage and question himself means he is also unable to apologise. True empathy and responsibility prove an adventure too far. He\u2019s physically close, but miles apart in his mind.</p> <h2>Three alternative radio recommendations</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.resonancefm.com/\">Resonance FM\u2019s 18th birthday</a> </strong><em><strong><br></strong></em>Resonance FM, the most determinedly alternative and creative community radio station of them all, has made it to adulthood \u2013 possibly a shock to both itself and its parent, founder Ed Baxter. On Friday, it celebrated its 18th birthday with 48 specially commissioned shows from its impressive list of contributors (including our own Stewart Lee), plus archive sessions from Sleaford Mods and Kate Tempest, and a special gig from the unlikely combo of Led Zep\u2019s John Paul Jones, Rip Rig + Panic\u2019s Steve Noble and Sonic Youth\u2019s Thurston Moore. More power to its weirdness.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://play.acast.com/s/latenightswithiainlee\">The Late Night Alternative With Iain Lee</a> </strong><em><br></em>One of the few truly original call-in shows out there, Lee\u2019s award-winning talkRadio show, which he hosts on weekdays, 10pm-1am, with producer Katherine Boyle, never fails to surprise. It\u2019s rare that it doesn\u2019t make me laugh out loud \u2013 Barry from Watford leading a communal meditation had me howling on Monday \u2013 but it\u2019s also very touching, providing a genuine service for lonely people in lockdown. I have banged on about this show before, but I will continue to do so as long as it remains one of the few places where humour and humanity coexist. Tune in: you never know what will happen.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p07s2912\">Slow Radio</a><br></strong>Eleanor McDowall\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://fieldrecordings.xyz/\">Field Recordings</a></em>, which I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/22/girl-taken-immaculate-deception-review\">reviewed a couple of weeks ago</a>, are the most pure and up-to-date slow radio recordings. But BBC Sounds has a nice back catalogue of slow episodes, made by a producer putting a microphone in a particular place, shutting up and pressing record. This being the BBC, the producers can\u2019t resist a commentary, which can be irritating. But when that stops, you get some lovely, ear-filling almost-silence. The immersive sound of a still place, or \u2013 at least \u2013 a place where humans don\u2019t feel the need to fill the airwaves with talk. As a chatterbox, I love it.</p>",
  "<p>There is a famous scene in the first episode of <em>Friends</em> in which Ross says: \u201cI just want to be married again\u201d and Rachel runs into Central Perk, right at that moment, wearing a wedding dress. \u201cAnd I just want a million dollars,\u201d Chandler quips, holding out his hands.</p> <p>A few weeks ago, before the lockdown, I wrote about how I had tried to revive the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/feb/09/the-lost-art-of-having-a-chat\">old-fashioned phone call</a>, wondering if ringing people for a chat might make a comeback. I missed the human connection of talking and when texting became our primary mode of communication, I felt the absence of a simple natter keenly.</p> <p>And I just want a million dollars. Six weeks in and here we are. We phone, we FaceTime, we Zoom, we Houseparty. I even did a Skype. In the absence of face-to-face human connection, the videocall is king. In her cover interview with <em>The Cut</em> last week, Chlo\u00eb Sevigny admitted that she had not previously been a fan of videocalling. \u201cIt\u2019s always so terribly unflattering,\u201d she said. Still, needs must and Sevigny admitted that under lockdown she now FaceTimes her friends.</p> <p>The necessary shift from the total remove of texting to seeing people during almost every communication is like popping out for one quiet drink and returning home several nights later with a buttock tattoo and a new nickname that ends in \u201cdawg\u201d. It is a sensory overload, a 0-60mph in 2.4 seconds. Before social distancing, I tended to FaceTime only children, because it is hard to pull faces at kids using just audio. Now, almost everyone expects a videocall, no matter how old. (The face pulling is less in demand.)</p> <p>It requires some adjustment, not so much because it\u2019s unflattering, but because the usual rules of communication no longer apply. How does a conversation between more than two people suddenly seem like a finals-week-of-<em>Strictly</em> manoeuvre? In real life, it just sort of flows. On screen, it\u2019s a \u201cno, after you\u201d comedy of manners. Where does one angle the camera? Up, it seems: recently, a judge in Florida had to remind lawyers to dress appropriately during virtual hearings; one man appeared topless, a woman while still in bed, under the sheets.</p> <p>More importantly, how does anyone manage to end a videocall without seeming rude? Ordinarily, I\u2019d go for a \u201csorry, reception\u2019s bad\u201d, but that\u2019s impossible to pull off when your bad acting is right there on display. Even Sevigny knows where to draw the line. \u201cI\u2019m not doing any Zoom parties,\u201d she said.</p> <h2>Race Across the World: travel show was life-affirming, not torture</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b51955c4a7e4c94cf7ae0e3de9a23b40490fd96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b51955c4a7e4c94cf7ae0e3de9a23b40490fd96/413_613_3357_2014/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emon and Jamiul Choudhury\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Winners with heart: Emon and Jamiul Choudhury.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Wiseman/BBC/Studio Lambert</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over the last few weeks, watching a series all about travelling prodigious distances and exploring the wonders of this planet should have seemed as appealing as squeezing lemon juice into a paper cut, but <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2020/apr/27/no-fly-zone-will-race-across-the-world-be-the-last-travel-tv-of-its-kind\">Race Across the World</a></em> has been one of the loveliest television shows in ages.</p> <p>During the first of the BBC Two series, five teams had to make their way from London to Singapore by land, without smartphones, using only the cash equivalent of the airfare. This time, the teams had to travel the length of South America, from Mexico City to Ushuaia at the tail end of Argentina.</p> <p>The finale was astoundingly tense, but when uncle and nephew team Emon and Jamiul Choudhury <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8262751/BBC-Race-World-winners-Emon-Jamiul-Choudhury-discuss-nail-biting-finale.html\">signed their names</a> in the book first \u2013 20 seconds ahead of the runners-up \u2013 it was hard to deny they deserved the win. They pulled it off by bartering MP3 players and ditching their bags before running up the final hill. But what made it the most life-affirming show I\u2019ve seen all year was that the winners were so affected by seeing children sleeping rough in the streets in Brazil\u2019s S\u00e3o Paulo that they donated half of their \u00a320,000 prize fund to charity. They have since <a href=\"https://www.examinerlive.co.uk/news/local-news/inspiring-plans-bradford-winners-race-18157727\">pledged another \u00a35,000</a> to an orphanage in Bangladesh. I already thought it was <em>Hunted</em> for nice people and then they hit us with that.</p> <p>In the chaos of our present lives, watching people become more self-sufficient than they thought possible was almost as joyful as watching how much strangers can be willing to support each other when they really need to. As a series, this was a convincing advert for fundamental human decency. I thought <em>University Challenge</em> ending would be the biggest blow but now that <em>Race Across the World</em> is gone, too, I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll manage.</p> <h2>Christine Baranski: vamping it up at virtual cocktail party</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b0ac6136ce37eabcc53c8718aa4e036e21355eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b0ac6136ce37eabcc53c8718aa4e036e21355eb/5_189_1099_659/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christine Baranski and a large glass of red\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christine Baranski and a large glass of red during The Ladies Who Lunch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: YouTube</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I imagine that one day there will be a corner of the internet that caters to everyone\u2019s wildest dreams, no matter how niche.

  "<p>Malaysian authorities have rounded up and detained hundreds of undocumented migrants, including Rohingya refugees, as part of efforts to contain coronavirus, officials said.</p> <p>Authorities said 586 undocumented migrants were arrested in a raid in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, on Friday. Armed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/APRRN_/status/1256140805921619969\">police walked people through the city</a> in a single file to a detention building, according to activists. The UN said the move could push vulnerable groups into hiding and prevent them from seeking treatment.</p> <p>Those detained included young children and ethnic Rohingya refugees from Myanmar. Social media posts, including some by Malaysian politicians, have recently blamed Rohingya of committing crimes and accused them of dominating areas of the capital.</p> <p>The xenophobic campaigns have included activists having their names and photos circulated alongside inflammatory accusations, and have injected further fear into a community struggling for food and shelter through the pandemic lockdown.</p> <p>Police said the operation was aimed at preventing undocumented migrants from travelling to other areas amid movement curbs imposed to contain the spread of the virus outbreak, the state news agency Bernama reported.</p> <p>The UN urged Malaysia to avoid detaining migrants and release all children, warning that overcrowded detention centres carried a high risk of increasing the virus\u2019s spread.</p> <p>\u201cThe fear of arrest and detention may push these vulnerable population groups further into hiding and prevent them from seeking treatment, with negative consequences for their own health and creating further risks to the spreading of Covid-19 to others,\u201d the UN said in a statement.</p> <p>A statement from the home minister, Hamzah Zainuddin, <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2020/04/30/rohingya-refugees-have-no-right-or-basis-to-make-demands-says-home-minister\">reiterated</a> that the Rohingya were considered \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d in Malaysia, which does not recognise refugees, and \u201chave no status, right and basis to present any demands to the government\u201d.</p> <p>Rohingya activists have denied accusations they were demanding Malaysian citizenship, which have been spread as part of a wave of abuse targeted at the community since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/bangladesh-rescues-hundreds-of-rohingya-drifting-at-sea-for-nearly-two-months\">Malaysia was criticised</a> for refusing to allow boats of refugees to land, citing Covid-19 as a reason.</p> <p>Malaysian activist Tengku Emma Zuriana Tengku Azmi, an ambassador for the European Rohingya Council, said she had been shocked by Malaysian attitudes towards the Rohingya.</p> <p>\u201cIn Malaysia right now everybody is scared, anxious and worried about their situation because they can\u2019t work, they don\u2019t earn enough and some of the aid hasn\u2019t reached the poor,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThey hear Rohingya boats are coming and perhaps they fear these people will steal their resources.\u201d</p> <p>Phil Robertson, Human Rights Watch\u2019s deputy Asia director, said of the detentions: \u201cThis is perhaps the most mindless and inane thing PM Muhyiddin [Yassin] and his ministry of home affairs could have done, but they appear committed to promoting a policy of fear and xenophobia that transfers the anger of the Malaysian public on to foreigners who cannot defend themselves.\u201d</p> <p>Nay San Lwin, the co-founder of the Free Rohingya Coalition group, said the home ministry\u2019s statement \u201cmade us like we are less than human\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI have never expected Malaysia will treat us like [it is] now but sadly it is happening,\u201d he said. \u201cI have only one message for Malaysians \u2013 restore your humanity.\u201d</p> <p>John Quinley, of Fortify Rights, said: \u201cDuring the Covid-19 pandemic there has been a growing anti-Rohingya campaign in Malaysia. Both citizens and politicians have been pushing a narrative implausibly linking the spread of the virus to Rohingya communities.<br><br>\u201cNow authorities in Malaysia are conducting immigration raids in the capital instilling fear in refugee and migrant communities.

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Global number of infections passes 3.3m</h2> <p>At least 3,357,450<strong> </strong>people have been infected and at least 238,787 have died around the world since the pandemic began, according to researchers from Johns Hopkins University.</p> <p>The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the scale of the outbreak, due to suspected underreporting, as well as differing testing and statistical regimes.</p> <h2>Malaysia rounds up undocumented migrants</h2> <p>Malaysian authorities are rounding up undocumented migrants as part of efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus, the country\u2019s police chief said late on Friday, after hundreds of migrants and refugees were detained in the capital, Kuala Lumpur. More than 700 migrants were taken into custody, including young children and ethnic Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, during Friday\u2019s raid in a downtown area where thousands of migrants and asylum seekers live, rights groups said.</p> <h2>Russia reports 9,623 new cases, a record daily rise</h2> <p>Russia has had another record daily increase, with 9,623 new cases of coronavirus on Saturday, bringing the total to 124,054.</p> <p>Reuters reported the nationwide death toll rose to 1,222 after 57 people died in the previous 24 hours, according to Russia\u2019s coronavirus crisis response centre. Russia has been in partial lockdown since the end of March.</p> <p>The mayor of Moscow said about 2% of the city\u2019s population, more than 250,000 people, had the virus.</p> <h2>US regulators approve use of experimental drug remdesivir</h2> <p>Officials have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/remdesivir-emergency-use-fda-us-coronavirus\">allowed the emergency use of the experimental drug remdesivir</a>, which appears to help some coronavirus patients recover faster. It is the first drug shown to help fight Covid-19.</p> <p>Donald Trump announced the news on Friday at the White House alongside Stephen Hahn, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commissioner, who said the drug would be available for patients admitted to hospital with Covid-19.</p> <h2>Ninety-eight people die in New York nursing home</h2> <p>A nursing home in New York has<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/02/new-york-nursing-home-reports-98-coronavirus-deaths-in-horrifying-outbreak\"> reported a \u201chorrifying\u201d death toll of 98 people</a> from Covid-19 as residential facilities continue to emerge as a deadly source of outbreaks around the world.</p> <p>The death toll at the Isabella Geriatric Center in Manhattan is one of the worst such outbreaks in the US and caused a shock even in hard-hit New York, where the official state tally of nursing home deaths listed only 13 at that particular home as of Friday.</p> <p>Officials at the 705-bed centre later confirmed that up to 46 residents who tested positive for Covid-19 had died, as well as an additional 52 people suspected to have had the virus, Associated Press reported. Some died at the nursing home and others in hospitals.</p> <h2>UK minister accused of artificially boosting test numbers</h2> <p>The UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/ministers-accused-of-changing-covid-19-test-tally-to-hit-100000-goal\">has been accused of changing the criteria for counting</a> Covid-19 tests after he claimed victory in reaching the target of 100,000 a day. Critics said that a large proportion of the 122,000 tests counted on Friday were tests that had been mailed to addresses but not yet carried out.</p>",

With tens of thousands of Americans dying and millions losing their jobs, how sad it would be if we learned nothing from all that we have done wrong.</p> <p>Do we really want to continue the current expensive and cruel system that ties healthcare to our jobs?

Or do we want a system that negotiates drug prices like every other country on Earth?</p> <p>Do we really want to continue the complicated, wasteful and bureaucratic system in which virtually every visit to a doctor or hospital requires the filling out of endless forms in order to determine how much of our deductible we have paid, what percentage of our procedure is covered, and whether we got sick in the appropriate \u201cnetwork\u201d?

  "<p>In the winter of 2002, nine months before Hanif Qadir unpacked his bag at a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan, a group of men walked into the London MOT testing centre he owned with his brothers. They were collecting money for civilians caught up in the US invasion of Afghanistan; hundreds of children had been orphaned by indiscriminate bombing, the men claimed. Could he help? The appeal resonated with Qadir, who had lost his father when he was seven. He made a donation.</p> <p>The men returned regularly. Each time, they asked for more money, before gradually changing the subject to Qadir\u2019s faith. Eventually they invited him to a meeting at a local house to discuss the war in Afghanistan more freely. \u201cI felt they were sincere and genuine,\u201d Qadir recalls. At the meeting, the men encouraged Qadir to visit websites that claimed to show photographic evidence of violence against Afghan civilians by western troops.</p> <p>Qadir browsed hundreds of distressing images, among them scores of orphans, each accompanied by extended captions that described the way in which the child\u2019s family had been killed. One girl\u2019s story has remained with him. The website claimed she had lost 21 members of her family to a \u201cstray\u201d US missile. The caption explained it had taken locals three days to scrape their remains from the walls of the girl\u2019s home. The more he saw, the closer Qadir became to the men who were, unbeknown to him, recruiters for al-Qaida.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If someone calls for genocide against Muslims, \u2018they\u2019ve essentially tattooed a swastika to their forehead online\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Qadir grew up in Thornaby-on-Tees, a small town in North Yorkshire. After his father died, he had disengaged from school, leaving at 14 and moving to London. After a few odd jobs, he founded a business with his brothers, buying, repairing and selling cars. By the early 2000s, the business was profitable enough that he was able to donate generously to charitable community causes, a reputation that, he believes, led the recruiters to his door.</p> <p>The suggestion that Qadir travel to Afghanistan was seeded gently. \u201cWhen a person is radicalised they become suggestible,\u201d he tells me. \u201cWe discussed that, in order to prevent more loss of life, we needed to be prepared to fight.\u201d On 2 December 2002, he flew to Islamabad in Pakistan. A few days later, he crossed the border into Afghanistan.</p> <p>Soon after he arrived at a training camp, Qadir saw a man measuring up children who lived there. \u201cI thought they were being tailored for new clothes,\u201d he recalls. Then he heard one of the leaders telling the children they would soon be reunited with their dead parents. They were being fitted for suicide vests. \u201cI felt sick and angry,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to walk away.\u201d</p> <p>But in the middle of a desert compound patrolled by armed guards, any attempt to defect could be fatal. Qadir was trapped. \u201cI knew that if I asked to leave things would end badly.\u201d He had to think carefully.</p> <p>***</p> <p>In 2002, when Qadir was being radicalised, the internet was not yet ubiquitous. There was no Twitter, no Facebook; websites looking to groom people into supporting extremist causes were obscure. Two decades later, the digital landscape has been transformed. As the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Hate Crime <a href=\"http://www.appghatecrime.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/APPG%20on%20Hate%20Crime%20Report%20Hate%20Crime%20and%20Community%20Cohesion.pdf\" title=\"\">wrote last year</a>, the internet has become a \u201ckey breeding ground\u201d for extremism and hate speech \u2013 emboldened by the increasing ease of dissemination, anonymity and, thanks to outdated legislation, a lack of meaningful consequences.</p> <p>Perpetrators of terrorist attacks now routinely leave online statements or manifestos to justify their actions, hoping their words might encourage others. The 28-year-old gunman who killed 51 mosque-goers in Christchurch, New Zealand, last year posted a 73-page white nationalist rant to the fringe web forum 8chan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/21/facebook-could-have-moved-faster-on-christchurch-video-if-it-were-suicide\" title=\"\">and livestreamed the attack on Facebook</a>.</p> <p>But now, just as Facebook and Twitter have become the prodigious muck-spreaders of our age, a handful of clandestine startups are using technology to stem the flow. <a href=\"http://moonshotcve.com\" title=\"\">Moonshot,</a> whose office is at a secret location in London, is, at five years old, a veteran in this emerging industry. Its premises have the feel of a typical Silicon Valley operation: distressed floorboards, glass-fronted offices, beanbags by an open fireplace, exposed brickwork, a snug for breathers. There are a few clues that the company\u2019s business \u2013 using technology to disrupt violent extremism \u2013 is different from that of the fitness app developers, social media influencers and virtual reality speculators with whom it shares an aesthetic. The posters are not vintage prints but disquieting infographics revealing, for example, that after 22 people were shot dead in an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/el-paso-shooting\" title=\"\">El Paso Walmart</a> last August, there was an 82% rise in the Google search term \u201chow to murder Mexicans\u201d. There is also a bomb-proof door.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8a7a77d5f7955afd69ac78049dccfbaa56fae22e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a7a77d5f7955afd69ac78049dccfbaa56fae22e/161_0_1688_1012/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vidhya Ramalingam and Ross Frenett\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vidhya Ramalingam and Ross Frenett founded Moonshot, a company that uses technology to disrupt violent extremism.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rino Pucci</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cofounder Vidhya Ramalingam set up the EU\u2019s first intergovernmental research initiative to investigate far-right terrorism in the aftermath of the 2011 murder of 77 people by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/anders-behring-breivik\" title=\"\">Anders Breivik</a> in Norway. She describes Moonshot\u2019s work as \u201cexperimental programming\u201d. The company employs 50 people, and uses a mixture of software and human judgment to identify individuals on the internet who, like Qadir, appear interested in extremist propaganda. They then attempt to serve them counter-messaging.</p> <p>The technology uses a \u201cdatabase of indicators of risk\u201d. An individual is awarded \u201crisk points\u201d according to their online behaviour. You score one point for showing curiosity about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2017/jun/04/neo-nazi-gathering-kentucky-kkk-traditionalist-worker-party\" title=\"\">Ku Klux Klan or National</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2017/jun/04/neo-nazi-gathering-kentucky-kkk-traditionalist-worker-party\" title=\"\"> Socialist Movement</a>. Activity that indicates sympathy with a violent movement or ideology (eg Googling \u201cwhite pride worldwide\u201d) earns three points, while showing a desire to join, send money to, or commit acts on behalf of a violent extremist group or individual earns six.</p> <p>Home Office initiatives such as <a href=\"https://www.ltai.info/what-is-prevent/\" title=\"\">Prevent</a> have traditionally focused on training teachers and other leaders to identify people likely to be drawn to violent extremism within their communities \u2013 but these methods risk introducing discriminatory practices. \u201cIn France, for example, there were posters telling people their sons might be at risk of violent extremism if they grow a beard, start speaking Arabic or stop eating baguettes,\u201d explains Ross Frenett, Moonshot\u2019s cofounder. \u201cThat is obvious bullshit.\u201d</p> <p>By contrast, Frenett says, if someone makes a post glorifying Hitler, or calls for genocide against Muslims, there is a high degree of certainty that they fall into a high-risk category. \u201cThey\u2019ve essentially tattooed a swastika to their forehead in the online space,\u201d he says. \u201cSo our level of confidence when identifying individuals who are vulnerable to radicalisation is way higher online than it could ever be offline. And it sidesteps some of the discriminatory, stigmatising practices we\u2019ve seen in an offline setting.\u201d</p> <p>Moonshot, founded in September 2015, is a for-profit company that earns its income from government contracts in the UK, US, Canada, Australia and across western Europe. It does not limit its work to any particular strain of radicalism; in addition to the far-right and jihadism, Moonshot\u2019s work covers everything from Buddhist extremism in south Asia, to Hindu nationalism and \u201cincel\u201d terrorism in Canada.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The skill is in finding out what raised a person\u2019s interest in extremist ideology. You can\u2019t redirect them until you do</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the broadest level, Moonshot runs what it refers to as \u201credirection material\u201d \u2013 advertising that is designed to \u201cget in front of\u201d extremist material in Google\u2019s search results. Google has granted Moonshot dispensation to advertise against banned search terms such as \u201cjoin Isis\u201d. If a user clicks on one of Moonshot\u2019s camouflaged results, they are taken to, for example, a mental health website with relevant downloadable guides and a chat option. (These sites are run by partnered mental health organisations and groups that have experience dealing with gang violence. As Frenett puts it, they have \u201cappropriate risk protocols, and connections with law enforcement, should they be required\u201d.) So long as the search terms are carefully calibrated (advertising against \u201cwhite power\u201d is useless, Frenett explains, as you end up competing with power-tool companies) this can be an effective first contact.</p> <p>Success is measured in much the same way as any company seeking to advertise on Google, via click conversions. (\u201cWe pay for advertising just like any commercial advertiser does,\u201d Ramalingam says. \u201cWe don\u2019t get special rates. I wish we had a better story on that front.\u201d) A key metric is \u201csearch impression share\u201d, which records the amount of time your at-risk audience saw the ad. \u201cWe\u2019ve had campaigns that have run with only 50%, and that\u2019s not good enough,\u201d Ramalingam says. \u201cSo we work hard to get that up to 98% where possible.\u201d For this reason, as well as mental health practitioners and ex-police officers, Moonshot also employs marketers. \u201cMost of our work is analytics, marketing and social work,\u201d Frenett says. \u201cIt just happens to be marketing, analytics and social work related to terrorism.\u201d</p> <p>Occasionally the company will identify an individual who is too high risk for their interventions. \u201cThat\u2019s where, depending on the country we\u2019re working in, we refer a user to the police,\u201d Frenett says. In Australia, for example, Moonshot identified someone at the top of a network of around 200 at-risk individuals considered \u201cso risky we couldn\u2019t intervene\u201d. A few days later, the local police arrested the man, who was subsequently convicted on terror charges.</p> <p>There are deeper kinds of intervention. One of Moonshot\u2019s advertisements for, say, \u201cbomb manuals\u201d will take the searcher to a WhatsApp chat manned by a specialist trained in deradicalisation techniques. The company may also identify someone on a particular social media platform openly espousing pro-extremist or pro-terrorist views. Then a trained social worker, typically from a charitable partner organisation, contacts that individual via Twitter direct message or Facebook Messenger. Choosing the right person to make this kind of contact, which may be perceived as invasive, is essential. In many cases, the right person is a former extremist \u2013 someone like Hanif Qadir.</p> <p>***</p> <p>When Qadir realised the children in the Afghan training camp were being measured for suicide vests, his first instinct was to exact revenge on the people who had manipulated him. \u201cBut I only had a knife, no gun,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I knew that I couldn\u2019t tell anyone I wanted out.\u201d</p> <p>He stepped outside the gate of the camp to consider his options. There he spotted the driver of a pick-up truck with whom he had talked a few times. The men did not share a first language, but Qadir gambled. He pulled out \u00a350 and waved it at the man, asking if he could hitch a ride to Turkham, on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. The driver nodded. Qadir climbed into the passenger seat. \u201cI didn\u2019t even collect my bag,\u201d he recalls.</p> <p>Qadir says he cried during the flight to London. \u201cI kept asking myself: \u2018What the hell have I done?\u2019\u201d When he arrived home, he and his brothers attempted to find his recruiters, but they had disappeared; the word was that they had moved to Manchester. Qadir decided he no longer wanted to run the car business and convinced his brothers to sell up. \u201cI just wanted to stay at home with my children.\u201d</p> <p>After a period of recuperation, he and his brothers opened a gym in a disused nightclub, which became a place where local youths, many of them young Muslims, would congregate. \u201cWe\u2019d talk,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d ask them questions about Afghanistan. I saw a lot of anger and questioning. It was clear to me that all it would take is for one person to manipulate them emotionally and they would get straight on a plane to fight. Or maybe they would do something here.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92014a2374e6f83a792163e3a6aa1095258a1586\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92014a2374e6f83a792163e3a6aa1095258a1586/410_555_4164_2496/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hanif Qadir standing in a room with a pool table and graffiti-style art on the wall\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hanif Qadir went to a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan, but now works with young people at risk of radicalisation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eager to communicate this to someone in a position of power, Qadir started attending local council meetings. A police inspector, Ian Larnder, took him for a coffee, hoping to better understand why this former mechanic seemed so passionate about the subject. \u201cUntil then, I had told nobody about what had happened,\u201d Qadir recalls. \u201cIan was the first person I opened up to.\u201d A week later, Larnder was appointed to the police\u2019s national community tension team. He took Qadir with him to speak to forces around the country about his experiences.</p> <p>Today, with a number of other former extremists, Qadir works with Moonshot, where he provides training for online interventions. \u201cThe skill is in finding out what has raised a person\u2019s interest in extremist ideology,\u201d he explains. \u201cYou can\u2019t redirect a person until you understand this. It\u2019s no good asking something so broad as: \u2018What do you think about what is happening in India?\u2019 It has to be specific and personable. So instead you might say: \u2018Is it permissible to seek revenge for the loss of a loved one?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>This sort of broad line of questioning \u2013 and the fact that an anonymous dialogue might tail off, without scope for any follow-up \u2013 can seem frustratingly opaque for anyone trying to measure Moonshot\u2019s success. It\u2019s a criticism the company is used to fielding. \u201cThe struggle with preventive work is that, very often, it\u2019s unscientific and we have to ask people to take it on trust,\u201d Frenett says. \u201cIt\u2019s easy for a military contractor to come in and say, \u2018I installed a big, high fence and a man with a gun and that reduced terrorism.\u2019 Likewise, the army can come along and state: \u2018We killed 200 Taliban this week.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s much harder to say, \u2018OK. We invested $1m here and we prevented this much terrorism.\u2019 Our long-term aim is to start to change that calculation. Then we\u2019ll be able to say: \u2018If one dollar in every 100 spent on military hardware went towards targeted, community-focused preventive work it would be better value \u2013 and probably better for the world.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>In the corner of a chilly room at the end of a corridor in Cardiff University\u2019s Glamorgan Building, a flood of racial slurs, misogyny, antisemitism and far-right slogans flows across a PC screen. \u201cImagine you had a crystal ball in which you could watch someone perpetrating every hate crime as it occurred somewhere out there, on the streets,\u201d explains Matthew Williams, director of HateLab. \u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re looking at here, except the hate is happening online.\u201d</p> <p>While Moonshot and Qadir intervene with individuals who are vulnerable to extremism, HateLab\u2019s aim is to provide a more accurate picture of hate speech across the internet. It is, Williams says, the first platform to use AI to detect online hate speech in real time and at scale.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Moonshot\u2019s ads for, say, \u2018bomb manuals\u2019 take the searcher to a WhatsApp chat manned by a deradicalisation specialist</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Online hatred is so commonplace that the majority of incidents go unreported. According to British government data, <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/748598/hate-crime-1718-hosb2018.pdf\" title=\"\">1,605 hate crimes occurred online between 2017 and 2018</a>, a 40% increase on the previous year. But the Home Office admits this figure is probably a gross underestimate. </p> <p>\u201cUnlike the police, we don\u2019t have to wait for a victim to file a report,\u201d Williams says. \u201cThe program reflects a true indication of the prevalence of online hatred.\u201d</p> <p>It offers a granular indication, too. Williams specifies a date range, then picks from a filter of potential target groups: Jews, homosexuals, women, and so on (misogyny is by far the most prevalent form of hate speech on Twitter, he says). He selects \u201canti-Muslim\u201d and a heat map of the UK lights up in red blotches showing geographical hotspots. Elsewhere, it reports the average number of hateful posts per minute and the peak times of day (hate speech, the group has found, is most prevalent during the daily commute, when people read and react to the day\u2019s news).</p> <p>A word cloud indicates the most-used anti-Muslim slurs, while a spiderweb visualises a network of perpetrators, identifying the \u201cthought leaders\u201d who are generating the most retweets, and how they are linked, via online accounts. \u201cHateLab gives situational awareness to hate speech on Twitter at any given time,\u201d Williams says. </p> <p>Early last month, HateLab identified three forms of coronavirus-related hate speech: anti-Chinese or Asian; antisemitic, focused on conspiracy theories; and Islamophobic, focused on accusations of profiteering. \u201cWhat we are seeing is a threat to health being weaponised to justify targeting minority groups, no matter how illogical the connections may seem,\u201d Williams explains.</p> <p>(Moonshot has monitored similar rises in hate speech targeting Chinese nationals. The hashtag #ChinaLiedPeopleDied was tweeted 65,895 times in March, while #coronavirustruth, implying that the pandemic is a hoax, was used 77,548 times. The company also picked up tweets showing old videos of Muslim men leaving mosques accompanied by text claiming the footage was filmed during quarantine, a <a href=\"https://tellmamauk.org/no-the-muslims-praying-in-this-video-arent-ignoring-the-coronavirus-lockdown-its-far-right-fake-news/\" title=\"\">seemingly deliberate attempt to create anti-Muslim sentiment</a>.)</p> <p>Williams, author of a forthcoming book titled The Science Of Hate, is a professor of criminology at Cardiff, but his interest in the field is not purely academic. In 1998, he travelled to London with friends to celebrate a birthday. At some point during the evening, he stepped out of the gay bar in which the group was drinking. Three young men approached. One asked if Williams had a light. As he handed over his Zippo, the man punched him in the face. Williams returned to his friends but said nothing, fearing that they would want to retaliate. Eventually, one of them noticed blood on his teeth and urged him to report the attack. \u201cI said no,\u201d Williams recalls. \u201cAt that time my parents didn\u2019t know I was gay. My siblings didn\u2019t know, and neither did most people from my town. I didn\u2019t want to come out to the police.\u201d</p> <p>But Williams returned to Wales a changed person. \u201cAny attack on your identity has a profoundly destabilising effect,\u201d he says. \u201cI became angry and depressed. I modified my behaviour. I stopped holding my boyfriend\u2019s hand. I still won\u2019t show affection in public.\u201d He was not alone in failing to report his attackers; based on the combined 2015/16 to 2017/18 Crime Survey for England and Wales, only 53% of <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/748598/hate-crime-1718-hosb2018.pdf\" title=\"\">hate crime incidents came to the attention of the police</a>. \u201cPeople are fearful of secondary victimisation,\u201d Williams says. </p> <p>As domestic internet use became more commonplace, Williams noticed the hate speech he encountered on the streets reflected online. The difference was that it was there for everyone to witness. Fellow academics were initially sceptical of his preoccupation with online behaviour, but by 2011 \u201ceveryone knew hate speech was the key problem of the internet\u201d. That year, Williams received a lottery grant of more than half a million pounds to accelerate his research.</p> <p>Every social media platform represents a torrent of information too deep and wide to sift by hand. Williams and his team began by taking a random sample of 4,000 tweets from a dataset of 200,000. The trove was then handed to four police officers, trained to recognise racial tensions, who each evaluated whether every tweet was discriminatory. If three of the four officers concurred, the tweet was classified as hate speech. Over a four-week period, the officers identified around 600 tweets they deemed discriminatory, data that formed the gold standard by which the AI would test if a message was \u201cmalignant\u201d or \u201cbenign\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You have to engage and create conversations, but direct them positively \u2013 allow for grievances to be heard and discussed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On the afternoon of 22 May 2013, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/dec/19/lee-rigby-murder-michael-adebolajo-adebowale-guilty\" title=\"\">fusilier Lee Rigby was killed</a> by two Islamist converts in Woolwich, London, the software had its first live test. Within 60 minutes of the attack, Williams and his team began harvesting tweets that used the keyword \u201cWoolwich\u201d. As the software sifted the data, the team was able to examine the drivers and inhibitors of hate speech, and identify accounts spreading anti-Muslim rhetoric. The team found that hate speech peaked for 24-48 hours, and then rapidly fell, while the baseline of online hate remained elevated for several months. Astonishingly, this was one of the first times a link between terror attacks and online hate speech had been demonstrated. And importantly, an increase in localised hate speech both anticipated the attack and, in the aftermath, shadowed it, showing that it might be possible to predict real world attacks.</p> <p>The data fascinated social scientists, but Williams believed it was more than interesting: it could have a practical application in helping counter these narratives. In 2017, he began a pilot scheme with the national online hate crime hub, which was set up to coordinate reporting into this area. It now uses the HateLab dashboard to gauge ebbs and flows in the targeting of particular groups, as well as nuances in local tensions. This information can then inform operational decisions, helping direct frontline police work.</p> <p>There are obvious privacy concerns, and HateLab must comply with data protection regulations. The platform depends on the willingness of Twitter to make its data available to third-party applications. (Facebook closed down open access in 2018, so independent organisations cannot screen its posts.) Twitter shares data on the proviso that HateLab does not identify individual accounts via its dashboard. \u201cIn that sense, we can only provide the 10,000ft view,\u201d Williams says. The dashboard can highlight patterns, target groups and geographical hotspots \u2013 but connecting with individuals is outside its remit.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Qadir and the other former extremists working alongside Moonshot recognise the power that hate speech can have, and know firsthand that a conversation can steer someone down a more positive path. \u201cYou can only change people if you can reach them via conversation,\u201d he tells me. \u201cViolent extremists do this very cleverly, and evidence shows that it works for them, so I based all my programmes on this concept. You have to engage and create conversations, but direct them positively \u2013 allow for grievances to be heard and discussed.\u201d</p> <p>Since Moonshot was founded, there has been a radical shift in the perception of technology\u2019s role when it comes to extremist terrorism. \u201cFive years ago, there were still people inside the government who thought tech was for the kids,\u201d Frenett says. \u201cThere was a sense that it was almost amusing that terrorists were on the internet. You don\u2019t get that any more. Likewise, five years ago there were some great organisations doing great work on the violent far-right, but again it was almost seen as niche. That\u2019s no longer the case.\u201d</p>",

Hang on, she says, looking away from her computer screen to the window with an alarmed expression. \u201cI\u2019m just going to go check that out. Stand by!\u201d</p> <p>If this were a horror movie, then the stylish woman disappearing into the distance would never come back. But it isn\u2019t a horror movie, it\u2019s a Zoom interview, and Ross, a Golden Globe-winning actor best known for her role in the US sitcom <a href=\"https://abc.com/shows/blackish\" title=\"\">Black-ish</a>, is talking to me from the sunny living room of her home. Or at least she was; right now, I\u2019m staring at a fiddle-leaf fig tree and a comfortable-looking couch.</p> <p>In a youth-obsessed Hollywood, many women find their careers decline with age, but at 47, Ross appears to be just hitting her stride. The actor, activist and entrepreneur has been in the public eye since her 20s, but started getting serious attention only in her early 40s, with Black-ish. Now on its sixth season, the show centres on an upper-middle-class African American family, living in a largely white LA neighbourhood, and stars Ross as the matriarch, anaesthetist Rainbow \u201cBow\u201d Johnson. Its unapologetic handling of race-related issues has turned the comedy into something of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/feb/25/series-creator-kenya-barris-on-abc-sitcom-black-ish\" title=\"\">cultural phenomenon</a>. Barack and Michelle Obama are fans; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/517293224831234048?s=20\" title=\"\">Donald Trump, who tweeted that the show was racism at the highest level, is not</a>.</p> <p>A few minutes after vanishing, Ross slides back in front of her computer and gives the all clear. There is no emergency except, you know, the one we\u2019re all living through. At the time of speaking, LA has been under lockdown for almost a month and, like the rest of us, Ross is still struggling to get to grips with it. \u201cI think we\u2019re all dealing with these waves of emotion where everything seems fine. And then it hits you. It\u2019s like the fear is just waiting right there.\u201d She gestures towards the window.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ff6de3ecc67a7d8a403fe5d1b029d7fa0695b59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ff6de3ecc67a7d8a403fe5d1b029d7fa0695b59/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tracee Ellis Ross in ABC\u2019s Black-ish Season Six, 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Black-ish season six this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Raymond Liu/ABC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The fear has not infiltrated her wardrobe. Ross\u2019s hair is styled into two Princess Leia-like space buns and she\u2019s wearing a floral, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jun/30/tate-modernist-how-georgia-okeeffe-shaped-feminist-style\" title=\"\">Georgia O\u2019Keeffe</a>-esque top. Even through the awkward interface of a Zoom call, her signature mix of goofiness and glamour comes through \u2013 a willingness to poke fun at herself that is a large part of her on-screen appeal. As Black-ish creator Kenya Barris once <a href=\"https://www.backstage.com/magazine/article/tracee-ellis-ross-loves-auditioning-8802/\" title=\"\">put it</a>, Ross \u201ccan do expressions and physical movement that take a joke from a five to a 10\u201d.</p> <p>But if Ross seems down to earth, her childhood was anything but. Her mother is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/diana-ross\" title=\"\">Diana Ross</a>, and her father, Robert Ellis Silberstein, is a successful music executive, who managed the likes of Ronnie Wood and Meat Loaf. As a child, she attended an elite school in Manhattan, and did a stint at the type of Swiss boarding school where a typical gym class means a skiing lesson. She did a photoshoot with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/andywarhol\" title=\"\">Andy Warhol</a> when she was 11, and modelled in her teens. How, I ask, did she avoid turning into a brat?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been taught that you work for the things you want,\u201d Ross says. \u201cMy mom always joked: \u2018I\u2019m not leaving you guys any of this money. I made this money for me! I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s a roof over your head. You can have health insurance and food. But other than that\u2026\u2019 I mean, I had a job in high school. I worked as a salesperson at Ralph Lauren. My mom was like, \u2018If you want to keep buying those clothes, you\u2019re going to have to figure out how to pay for them.\u2019 There was a commitment on her part to a normalcy that I have taken into my adult life.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d2246e50007eeddf3fec712ede1722db2f5afa6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d2246e50007eeddf3fec712ede1722db2f5afa6/0_875_2263_1711/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Diana Ross with her daughters backstage at the Palace Theater in New York June 14 1976.

Her parents split when she was five but remained on good terms, and the childhood she shared with her siblings (four of whom were Diana Ross\u2019s children, and three of whom were step-siblings from Ross\u2019s second marriage) sounds happy and wholesome.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Being the child of somebody famous might unlock the door, but the people on the other side have their arms crossed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cMy mom always put us in bed, then she\u2019d go to the recording studio while we were sleeping. She\u2019d sit with us for dinner and she never left for more than a week.\u201d Ross remembers her mother getting the kids to help her make the beds, and she remains a pro at hospital corners. Actually, she says, she still has some of those sheets. \u201cI nicked them out of the closet at home and Mom doesn\u2019t know I have them. They remind me of my childhood.\u201d</p> <p>But being her mother\u2019s daughter didn\u2019t necessarily help when it came to work. \u201cWhen I was starting in my career, being the child of somebody famous was not what it is today,\u201d Ross says. \u201cIt might unlock the door, but the people sitting on the other side have their arms crossed and are asking: \u2018OK, is she as good as her mom?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>She got her first big break as a comic on MTV\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0239178/\" title=\"\">The Lyricist Lounge Show</a> in 2000. The same year, she landed a lead role on the sitcom <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0247102/\" title=\"\">Girlfriends</a>, which ran for eight seasons, making it the longest-running live-action network sitcom at the time; but its predominantly black cast meant it was always pigeonholed as a \u201cblack show\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"806cf3aa15fc5a6f16ecd39a39e62037eb15785a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/806cf3aa15fc5a6f16ecd39a39e62037eb15785a/0_505_2250_2096/1000.jpg\" alt=\"JILL MARIE JONES, TRACEE ELLIS ROSS, PERSIA WHITE, GOLDEN BROOKS AND REGINALD C HAYES, IN GIRLFRIENDS, SEASON 3, 2002\" width=\"1000\" height=\"932\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Girlfriends in 2002.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AF archive/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe landscape of television was not the same as it is now,\u201d Ross says. \u201cIt was still very segregated. We go through waves in this country, around celebrating black narratives: the early 2000s were not that time.\u201d Despite the size of Girlfriends\u2019 audience, she didn\u2019t get invited on to the late-night TV shows, or the award shows, or the high-profile industry events. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a matter of how many eyeballs were watching the show,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a matter of <em>which</em> eyeballs were watching.\u201d</p> <p>Then, in 2014, Black-ish came along and \u201ceverything started to happen\u201d. In 2017 she won a Golden Globe for her role, making her the first black woman to pick up the award since 1983 (when <a href=\"https://www.goldenglobes.com/person/debbie-allen\" title=\"\">Debbie Allen won for Fame</a>). Her proud family had already taken out a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TraceeEllisRoss/status/765708111327866880/photo/1\" title=\"\">full-page ad</a> in the Hollywood Reporter to congratulate her on the nomination.</p> <p>Ross says one of the things that drew her to Black-ish was the way it disrupted conventional narratives. There is a warmth and respect between Bow and her on-screen husband, Andre \u201cDre\u201d Johnson, that isn\u2019t always evident in sitcoms. \u201cOften the comedy of married couples on television is about how they roll their eyes at each other, how they frustrate each other,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve never enjoyed that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d3764fa9e8a9afdf1543e663a42bbd5a3eb4c140\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3764fa9e8a9afdf1543e663a42bbd5a3eb4c140/60_27_2543_3973/640.jpg\" alt=\"Tracee Ellis Ross, winner of Outstanding Actress in a Comedy Series, attends the 50th NAACP Image Awards at Dolby Theatre on March 30, 2019 in Hollywood, California\" width=\"640\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With her NAACP award for Black-ish last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot that poked holes in the status quo, particularly as a woman of colour,\u201d she continues. \u201cWhile the story is told through the eyes of the man, I\u2019m not just the wife. I\u2019m not just a doctor. I\u2019m not just a mom. I\u2019m all of those things. And my point of view is not seen in relation to Dre\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s based in my experience and my life.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes, Ross says, Bow\u2019s autonomy was \u201cnaturally written into the script\u201d and sometimes she pushed for it. \u201cI\u2019m very conscious about not perpetuating stereotypes,\u201d she explains. \u201cIn a scene, if they have written that I\u2019m doing \u2018lady-chores\u2019 such as the cooking, I\u2019m like: why? It\u2019s not pivotal to the story. Let Dre do the chopping and I\u2019ll stand here at my computer, or drink a glass of wine, or hold a book. I speak up and I drive them crazy sometimes. But in the context of being a black woman on television, I am very aware of what that imagery says and the stereotypes it perpetuates. My interest is in offering other expressions, other examples, other imagery.\u201d</p> <p>Some of that \u201cother imagery\u201d is the experience of being mixed race, which we don\u2019t always see on mainstream TV. \u201cI had never, ever played that in my career,\u201d Ross says. \u201cEven though [being half black and half Jewish], that\u2019s what I live.\u201d While her character is clearly mixed race, Black-ish didn\u2019t meaningfully explore that facet of Bow\u2019s identity. \u201cIt ended up being relegated to this space of jokes,\u201d Ross says. \u201cAs a mixed person, you\u2019re constantly being bombarded by questions such as, \u2018Are you this, or are you that?\u2019 which is the least interesting part of being mixed\u2026\u201d She trails off for a second, losing her thread. \u201cYou know when you haven\u2019t been talking a lot?\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s like you lose access to words.\u201d</p> <p>She makes a wide-mouthed, silly face and recovers from Quarantine Voice\u2122 enough to explain how this particular frustration led her to co-create <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/tv/reviews/mixedish-review-blackish-spinoff-abc-1203347524/\" title=\"\">Mixed-ish</a>, a prequel to Black-ish that debuted on ABC last year. While Bow\u2019s heritage was a comic sidenote in Black-ish, Mixed-ish centres it: Ross narrates the story of Bow\u2019s childhood, as the daughter of a black mother and white father growing up in 80s America. But there were mixed reviews, with some critics deeming the show\u2019s politics too <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/10/mixed-ish-thomas-chatterton-williams-race/600679/\" title=\"\">simplistic</a>, and it\u2019s not clear whether it will be back for a second season.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0362fe141a595da4018776a7af5fa57e407d6ff8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0362fe141a595da4018776a7af5fa57e407d6ff8/0_30_2889_2106/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Actor Tracee Ellis Ross, December 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"729\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018As a mixed person, you\u2019re constantly being bombarded by questions: are you this, or are you that?\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amar Daved/Art Partner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, there is one thing Ross has not yet turned her hand to in a long and varied career. She has modelled, given a <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/tracee_ellis_ross_a_woman_s_fury_holds_lifetimes_of_wisdom/transcript?language=en\" title=\"\">TED talk</a> (on the power of women\u2019s fury) and signed up as an ambassador for <a href=\"https://timesupnow.org/\" title=\"\">Time\u2019s Up</a>.

She runs her own company, <a href=\"https://patternbeauty.com/\" title=\"\">Pattern</a>, a successful haircare line for people with naturally curly hair. But there is one thing she has spent her entire life petrified of doing: becoming a singer. \u201cI have wanted to sing since I was a kid,\u201d she tells me. \u201cBut it was something I buried, because it was too scary a dream.\u201d There was, after all, a lot to live up to.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At 47, to go into a studio and discover I had a voice: that was life-changing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A year ago she landed a lead role in a movie. Directed by <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0304091/\" title=\"\">Nisha Ganatra</a> (who worked on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/transparent\" title=\"\">Amazon\u2019s Transparent</a>), <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9308382/\" title=\"\">The High Note</a> sees Ross play a superstar singer, Grace Davis, whose career has peaked. Afraid of creating fresh material, Davis keeps trotting out old hits until her assistant (played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/dakota-johnson\" title=\"\">Dakota Johnson</a>) convinces her to record new work. Ross sings six original songs in the film, a dream come true for her. Then, all of a sudden, it was a dream deferred. The High Note was due to premiere in May; in an alternative, coronavirus-free universe, Ross would be crisscrossing the country on a busy promotion schedule. Now, she says, she\u2019s not sure if a premiere will ever happen. The film will be released, but nobody is quite sure when.</p> <p>A lot of people are dealing with much worse than cancelled movie premieres, she says. \u201cThis is a very small disappointment.\u201d But still, it stings. \u201cAt 47 years old, to go into the studio and start singing, and discover that I actually had a voice that could work\u2026 it was life-changing for me.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8de43decbd005a92ed30ae8100aba7da3cb1c1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8de43decbd005a92ed30ae8100aba7da3cb1c1b/0_0_2717_1811/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tracee Ellis Ross (in yellow dress) with (from left) Dakota Johnson, Ricky Martin and Ice Cube in the film The High Note , 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In The High Note, with Dakota Johnson, Ricky Martin and Ice Cube.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Planet Photos/Focus Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Did she really wait until 47 to start? \u201cPretty much. In high school, I took choir \u2013 it was one of the required courses \u2013 and we had to perform The Pirates Of Penzance. I was furious. I was so scared of singing in front of people that I marched myself to the headmaster\u2019s office: \u2018Mrs Regalman, I do not think that it\u2019s fair to force somebody who doesn\u2019t want to sing and who doesn\u2019t want to be on a stage to be on a stage.\u2019 And she told me I had to do it. So I did the play but I just mouthed the words.\u201d</p> <p>Ross sang in public a couple of times after that, but says she would always add \u201ca flare of comedy or hide behind a character\u201d. So it wasn\u2019t until very recently that she decided \u201cto face one of my biggest childhood fears. And, typical me, I didn\u2019t do it small \u2013 I decided to do it as the lead in a movie playing a musical diva.\u201d</p> <p>A couple of months ago, Ross unveiled a clip of her singing <a href=\"https://www.oprahmag.com/entertainment/a30950759/tracee-ellis-ross-oprah-2020-vision-tour/\" title=\"\">in the film, during an on-stage interview with Oprah Winfrey</a>. Curled up in her chair in an electric-blue suit, she looked on the verge of tears as the song, called Love Myself, played to a live audience. \u201cI had no memory of getting myself curled up in that chair until I looked over and saw the screen,\u201d she says. She wasn\u2019t the only emotional one: Oprah cried, too, and the audience applauded; Ross has a beautiful voice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d61d071899e70811541a631e0555acd5df31f6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d61d071899e70811541a631e0555acd5df31f6e/54_237_3767_2261/1000.jpg\" alt=\"(L-R) Rhonda Ross Kendrick, Callaway Lane, Chudney Ross, Evan Ross, Jagger Snow Ross, Diana Ross, host Tracee Ellis Ross, Raif-Henok Emmanuel Kendrick, Indigo Naess, Ross Naess, and Bronx Wentz pose in the press room during the 2017 American Music Awards at Microsoft Theater on November 19, 2017 in Los Angeles, California\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With her family, hosting the 2017 American music awards.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Granitz/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On-screen and off, she has spent much of her career challenging established narratives. She is often asked about her unmarried status, and has become a sort of accidental spokeswoman for the joy of being a single, childfree woman. The idea that being a woman means having a husband and kids is so deeply ingrained, she says, that most people don\u2019t even know how inappropriate they\u2019re being when they ask why she\u2019s not married. Strangers poking around in her uterus used to irritate her, but she doesn\u2019t \u201cmind any more. It no longer stings. It\u2019s just an opportunity for me to expand somebody\u2019s idea of the world and add something different. Women, particularly black and brown women, are told we should occupy a smaller area of real estate.

The Covid-19 outbreak has opened another chapter.</p> <p>After seven weeks in the slaughterhouses of Chicago, the journalist Upton Sinclair wrote The Jungle, a 1906 novel which described the grim conditions inside. \u201cThere were things that went into the sausage in comparison with which a poisoned rat was a tidbit,\u201d Sinclair wrote.</p> <p>The novel created a media frenzy and prompted the US government to investigate the industry. A wave of consumer protection laws followed.</p> <p>But these improvements masked the intent of Sinclair\u2019s novel: to highlight the exploitation of immigrant labor and unchecked greed. Sinclair famously declared: \u201cI aimed for the public\u2019s heart and by accident hit it in the stomach.\u201d</p> <p>Advanced industrialization and globalization after the second world war exacerbated the exploitation of workers. Instead of the Eastern European immigrants who staffed slaughterhouses at the turn of the century, by the 1970s these factories were filled with workers escaping conflict in South America and Asia. Production grew exponentially and labor unions lost power. Advances in worker safety could not keep up and today, working in a processing plant remains <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/05/amputations-serious-injuries-us-meat-industry-plant\">one of the most dangerous jobs in the country</a>.</p> <p>The plight of Central American migrants in the meat industry was drawn into sharp focus last year when the Trump administration\u2019s immigration enforcement agency (Ice) carried out its largest raid in years on four poultry facilities in Mississippi. They arrested <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/08/us/mississippi-immigration-raids-children/index.html\">680 undocumented workers</a> but none of the companies, which included the multibillion dollar Koch Foods, faced any charges over employment practices.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"224a626b5acd7fb0fb47e6856869b8b7ba3062cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/224a626b5acd7fb0fb47e6856869b8b7ba3062cf/0_276_3550_2129/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Poultry workers inside a Fieldale Farms chicken processing plant in Gainesville, Georgia, USA, 27 April 2020.

  "<p>The outset of the coronavirus pandemic in Northern Ireland was beset with political disputes. First Minister Arlene Foster, of the DUP, and Deputy First Minister Michelle O\u2019Neill, of Sinn F\u00e9in, held opposing views about the closure of schools, universities and childcare facilities. In the Republic, schools were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/ireland-school-closures-reveal-stark-contrast-to-uk-covid-19-response\">closed by 13 March</a>, but the UK planned to close schools a week later, on 20 March. As often happens, the situation in the North evoked the Irish saying <em>idir dh\u00e1 st\u00f3l</em>, a shorthand for falling between two stools, neither here nor there.</p> <p>While the Irish government offered grave clarity, the North remained caught up in the UK government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/19/six-points-of-criticism-uk-governments-flailing-coronavirus-response\">widely criticised</a> tactics. These divergent responses to coronavirus established an accidental case study of two separate but overlapping approaches to the pandemic taking place on the same island \u2013 something researchers will no doubt pore over in the future.</p> <p>The Irish caretaker taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, had spoken to Boris Johnson about the island of Ireland being one epidemiological unit, but the political divisions north of the border did not allow for that. Instead, different approaches were taken at the crucial first stage of the pandemic. While the British government leapfrogged over the containment phase, largely abandoning the WHO\u2019s mantra of \u201ctest, test, test\u201d, the Irish government scrambled to keep a lid on things, gradually introducing early lockdown measures, which benefitted from huge public cooperation. One of the most frequent refrains here in the patter of Covid smalltalk among friends and neighbours is \u201cat least we\u2019re not in England or America\u201d. But of course, part of the island <em>is</em> in the UK.</p> <p>Border counties are experiencing a different pattern of cases compared with much of the rest of the Republic. The border county of Cavan now has the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.ie/news/5365481/coronavirus-in-ireland-cavan-highest-number-per-100000/\">highest number of cases</a> relative to its population, even though it is only the 25th largest county by population in Ireland. Early on during the pandemic, it was reported that up to <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/coronavirus-in-ireland-cavan-general-calls-in-reinforcements-as-at-least-70-staff-go-off-sick-cr2grxdnm\">70 healthcare workers</a> in Cavan general hospital had contracted Covid-19, and there are also clusters of cases in residential-care settings in the region. While Dublin and its surrounding counties have been the worst affected, the border counties of Louth, Donegal and Monaghan have a higher rate of infection than those further south.</p> <p>The tendency to jump to a conclusion that the number of cases in border counties is related to the porous nature of the border itself, and so is a consequence of travel between north and south, may be misleading. We just don\u2019t know yet. Ireland\u2019s chief medical officer, Tony Holohan, who has cut a stoic figure throughout the crisis, has said it is unlikely that the high rate of infection in border counties is due to a \u201cspillover\u201d from the North.</p> <p>The public health doctor Gabriel Scally, president of the epidemiology and public health section of the Royal Society of Medicine, has said such hotspots require investigation. Scally lambasted the Department of Health in Northern Ireland on Twitter, saying the department \u201cis in deep and very hot water over their provision of statistics about Covid-19. I\u2019ve been very critical of their dreadful performance, and now the UK Statistics Authority have quite correctly, reprimanded them.\u201d He referenced a letter from Ed Humpherson, the director general for regulation at the statistics authority to Richard Pengelly, the permanent secretary of the Northern Ireland Department of Health, indicating that speculation about border cases is just one element of a wider issue about statistics related to the pandemic in the North.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GabrielScally/status/1255904747883769856\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Dept of Health in N Ireland is in deep and very hot water over their provision of statistics about <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19</a>.

The pandemic is many things, but it is political, and so too will be its consequences. The DUP showed that it was content to sacrifice the economic stability of Northern Ireland in pursuit of the empty, jingoistic rhetoric of Brexit, and at the outset of this pandemic, it did seem that public health was playing second fiddle to the party\u2019s lemming-like tendency to follow Westminster\u2019s instruction.</p> <p>Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il\u2019s recent (and vague) framework document for government formation, drafted as bait for the smaller parties they need to form their \u201cgrand coalition\u201d, having frozen Sinn F\u00e9in out of the process, tried on some of its policies, which essentially represent the mandate for \u201cchange\u201d voted for in the recent general election. One of the document\u2019s proposals is to establish a unit in the taoiseach\u2019s department \u201cto work towards a consensus on a united island\u201d, signifying a growing political case for a united Ireland, as well as something of an appeal to Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s massively increased voter base.</p> <p>Unexpected events often act as a catalyst for finding new pathways towards a goal. Nobody could have conceived that the case for a united Ireland would dovetail with the now urgent practicalities of a united approach to a public health crisis. But the big ideas we have about society often don\u2019t pan out how we anticipate. Eradicating the border\u2019s segmentation of two jurisdictions has been a peacetime issue, a Brexit issue and is now a public health issue.</p> <p>\u201cDisease knows no border. We have to work on all-island collective basis in what is an emerging crisis,\u201d O\u2019Neill said early on, a narrative that has continued through the course of the pandemic. \u201cIt\u2019s pure common sense that we need an all-island and a unified approach in dealing with this pandemic,\u201d Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s leader, <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/mary-lou-mcdonald-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-after-two-week-wait-1.4228544\">Mary Lou McDonald</a>, said on an RT\u00c9 radio programme, after she was praised for the low-key manner with which she dealt with a nasty bout of Covid-19, removing herself from the spotlight and only emerging when she recovered. And it\u2019s not just politicians proposing a unified Ireland in this context. The University of Limerick\u2019s professor of general practice, Liam Glynn, told the Irish Times, \u201cAnything other than an all-Ireland approach is bananas. We are an island.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Una Mullally is a columnist for the Irish Times</p>",

  "<p>Alistair and Jonny Brownlee always seem to match each other, whether it\u2019s winning medals in the triathlon at the past two Olympic Games or having birthdays in lockdown. Jonny won bronze in 2012 and silver in 2016 with Alistair the Olympic champion in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/aug/07/london-2012-alistair-brownlee-triathlon\">London</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/18/alistair-brownlee-jonny-triathlon-ollympics-rio-2016-gold-silver\">Rio</a>.

It\u2019s just weird in lockdown.

But, like everyone else, their lives have been turned inside out by the Covid-19 crisis which resulted in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/24/olympic-postponement-inevitable-but-finding-right-way-to-do-it-caused-delay\">postponement of the Olympics</a>.</p> <p>They can no longer train together and, illustrating their enforced separation, I talk to Alistair on his own before switching to Jonny. It\u2019s not quite the same as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/dec/05/brownlee-alistair-jonny-triathlon-olympics\">past interviews I\u2019ve done</a> with both of them wisecracking alongside each other \u2013 but it\u2019s still fascinating to hear how their competitive instincts remain undented by the pandemic.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m a lifelong athlete.

I go on this indoor platform which you link up with your turbo, and that\u2019s pretty cool. I\u2019ve enjoyed racing other people around the world on it because it\u2019s important to stay competitive. And I have the pool.\u201d</p> <p>The Olympic champion is not joking. He is still managing to swim every morning in his garage. \u201cA company called Endless Pool make them and I\u2019ve had it for a while. I\u2019ve mostly run in it because it\u2019s got a treadmill at the bottom, and that means you can run against the swimming current. It\u2019s fantastic. I can walk out my front door and do a swim session in the garage.\u201d</p> <p>A current of great velocity is generated so Alistair is effectively swimming on the spot. \u201cYou can swim really hard. The difficulty is motivation. I\u2019m used to swimming in a squad with Jonny. Being competitive is really important and I\u2019m missing that. But I set myself strict sessions. Get in and go as hard as I can. It\u2019s a treadmill for swimming. You stay still and the water moves around you. It\u2019s about the size of a car so I can\u2019t get the Volvo in the garage.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b38f05f1269620923643ce5b8c6affecee445f68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b38f05f1269620923643ce5b8c6affecee445f68/120_437_5352_3211/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alistair (right, with his gold medal) and Jonny Brownlee (with silver) after their Olympic triathlon triumph for Team GB at Rio 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alistair (right, with his gold medal) and Jonny Brownlee (with silver) after their Olympic triathlon triumph for Team GB at Rio 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is Alistair at his smoothest for it is a reminder that he and Jonny are now <a href=\"https://www.volvocars.com/uk/about/humanmade/discover-volvo/brownlee-brothers\">ambassadors for Volvo Car UK</a> and they will work with the company on numerous safety and sustainability related projects. But there is so much grit in Alistair as he has shown when winning two world championships, to match his Olympic pair, and in his recent switch to Ironman competition.</p> <p>Last October he attempted his first full Ironman (swimming 2.4 miles, cycling 112 miles and running a 26.2 mile marathon) at the world championships in Kona, Hawaii. Olympic triathlon distances cover a 0.93-mile swim, 24.8-mile bike ride and a 6.2-mile run. He was in third place early on in the Ironman marathon before Kona shredded him. <a href=\"http://www.220triathlon.com/news/ironman/jan-frodeno-wins-the-2019-ironman-world-champs/13074.html\">Brownlee finished 21st</a> and, woundingly for a serial winner, he was nearly 34 minutes behind the champion Jan Frodeno. The German\u2019s extensive Ironman experience exposed Brownlee as a novice.</p> <p>\u201cKona has got a hell of a reputation,\u201d Alistair says. \u201cBut I was optimistic I could nail it first time. I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Can he describe his ordeal over the last 20 miles? \u201cI\u2019ll need some expletives. I\u2019ve known about Kona for over 20 years, being a triathlete, so there was no way I was not finishing. But imagine being so tired, hot, thirsty, and your muscles cramping that you don\u2019t think you could run five more steps. But you have 20 miles to go.\u201d</p> <p>Alistair completed a second full Ironman in Western Australia six weeks later, on 1 December, and <a href=\"https://www.tri247.com/triathlon-news/elite/ironman-western-australia-2019-report\">won by more than 10 minutes</a> as he smashed the course record. \u201cI\u2019m proud I turned it around pretty quick because Western Australia is a hard Ironman in the heat. My attention then switched to the Olympics. I was training as hard as I could for the short distances. Six weeks ago I was thinking: \u2018I\u2019m going well here. The Olympics could be on.\u2019 And then the lockdown came.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/27/psg-nadia-nadim-football-refugee-reconstructive-surgeon-taliban-denmark\">PSG's Nadia Nadim: 'I know the value of helping a person when they have no hope'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite the continuing uncertainty, Alistair\u2019s ambition to win a third Olympic triathlon pulses stronger than ever. \u201cThat\u2019s obviously the dream, but there\u2019re a lot of challenges ahead.\u201d</p> <p>Jonny faces his own challenges.

Definitely. My winter training was based around getting the gold medal. I was very focused as I knew it was probably my last Olympics. But there\u2019s a chance to get two Olympics medals with the mixed team relay as well. I was really excited and now everything\u2019s changed.\u201d</p> <p>How has Jonny found the lockdown? \u201cWeird. Strange. Different. It\u2019s becoming a bit more normal now but I don\u2019t get to see any of my training partners and I\u2019m used to seeing them day in and day out. I\u2019ve been missing Alistair. I\u2019m used to training with him every day and I\u2019m a very routine person. I know exactly what I\u2019m doing every Tuesday morning. I\u2019ve been doing that for 15 years. So I\u2019ve had to find a new routine and I\u2019m enjoying training without any pressure of racing.\u201d</p> <p>Jonny, unlike his brother, is not swimming. Is there any chance he could hold an isolated session in Alistair\u2019s garage? \u201cNot at the moment but I\u2019ve swum every day since I was eight so I have that massive memory bank. Normally, I\u2019m up at 6:15 [to swim]. But these days I\u2019m getting up at 7:30.\u201d</p> <p>He might be enjoying his lockdown lie-ins but Jonny struggled at the start of this crisis. \u201cI came home [from training in New Mexico] feeling a bit low. I had gone from being in an Olympic-style camp to a \u2018what now?\u2019 feeling. What have I trained for? At first, I was a bit scared as well. It\u2019s all over the news, isn\u2019t it? So I definitely was a little low. But I take the positives now. I\u2019m still healthy and that\u2019s the most important thing.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Having Alistair to train with is so important. Not having him there meant I burnt out</p> <footer> <cite>Jonny Brownlee</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Jonny endured an earlier crisis of confidence. \u201cThe hardest time was 2018 around the Commonwealth Games. I picked up an injury in January and I rushed to get back. I had pain that whole year, but it was terrible at the Commonwealths. We were on the start line but Alistair had an injured calf and hamstring. Our bodies were broken.\u201d</p> <p>He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/05/jonny-alistair-brownlee-brothers-injury-commonwealth-games-triathlon\">finished seventh and Alistair was 10th</a> in a worrying confirmation of their troubles. Alistair switched to Ironman and Jonny\u2019s form slumped. He feels now that he overtrained but were there psychological overtones? Jonny had been staggeringly consistent for years. From June 2010 to May 2014 he had finished on the podium in 42 successive triathlons. He was world champion in 2012 and so did Alistair\u2019s absence intensify the pressure and lead to his poor results in 2018 and 2019?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"95c5d1a3ba6f604d9693f0c80ddcc737d0b9cd88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95c5d1a3ba6f604d9693f0c80ddcc737d0b9cd88/0_0_2000_1333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alistair and Jonny Brownlee.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alistair and Jonny Brownlee.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Carnegie Photography/PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jonny admits. \u201cIt was my time to shine. I felt I was the golden son and that had me invigorated. But having Alistair to train with is massively important. He pushes me in some ways, and we both hold back in other ways. That holding me back is quite important, because Alistair\u2019s so experienced. Whereas if Alistair\u2019s not there, your default position is always to push more. Not having Alistair there meant I didn\u2019t have a yardstick and I burnt out.\u201d</p> <p>Last July, Jonny came back and won his first World Triathlon Series race for two years in Edmonton. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/triathlon/49061838\">That was a big moment</a> for me. It was one of my proudest races because I doubted myself. Can I actually compete at the top any more? Edmonton told me I could and I was quite emotional.\u201d</p> <p>Does Jonny believe he will race another triathlon in 2020? \u201cMy gut feel is the World Series has been affected too much now. But I could do a Super League race at the end of the year. That\u2019s a really short, fast triathlon and they\u2019re more flexible with venues and dates. I\u2019m prepared for everything.\u201d</p> <p>I ask both brothers if they would give up an Olympic medal next year if it would mean that they can compete deep into their forties in Ironman or similar competitions. They both choose the long-haul option. \u201cI\u2019m a lifelong athlete.\u201d Alistair says. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine a day where I don\u2019t go running, cycling and swimming.\u201d</p> <p>Jonny agrees. \u201cIf you asked me this before London I would have said an Olympic medal. Now I have two Olympic medals but I love competing even more. The lockdown has taught me how much I appreciate sport. I definitely want to be doing this every day for a very long time.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for the Recap.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up for the Recap.</figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Volvo Car UK is the official vehicle partner of British Triathlon.</em></p>",
  "<p>\u201cI have gone from five years of continuous injuries to five years with almost nothing,\u201d says Katie Rood. The change? In 2015 the New Zealand international and Lewes forward switched to a vegan diet. \u201cThe longest injury I\u2019ve had since then was three weeks out with a hamstring earlier this season,\u201d she remarks.</p> <p>\u201cIt blew me away. I thought I was going to feel depleted and sick. I used to finish a game on a Sunday and have a heat pack on my shoulder, ice packs on my ankles, I\u2019d wake up on Monday feeling like a zombie. Getting out of bed was a struggle. Fast forward to two weeks after giving up meat, dairy, eggs and I was leaping out of bed. I felt two inches taller. I realised how inflamed I was everywhere, and that inflammation was gone.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/20/fifa-says-1bn-investment-in-womens-football-will-not-be-cut\">Fifa says planned \u00a3800m investment in women's football will not be cut</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The effect on her ability to recover fast had an effect on the pitch. \u201cBecause I could recover quicker I could train harder. So I started hitting the gym really hard and got so much stronger, which made me faster, which made me make better decisions on the pitch because I was fitter. It helped everything.\u201d</p> <p>It is fitting that when we first talk, pre-isolation, and discuss the merits of veganism we do so in a vegetarian and vegan restaurant where the food is so inventive that you can wholeheartedly buy into the absence of meat. The menu contrasts starkly with Rood\u2019s experience growing up, when she felt, as an aspiring athlete, trapped by a belief that meat and dairy were vital to a healthy diet.</p> <p>\u201cWe grew up surrounded by animals, and I loved every single one of them,\u201d she says. \u201cI never wanted to eat them. My mum used to cut up my meat and hide it under my vegetables and stuff. It didn\u2019t occur to them that it was healthy for me not to be [eating meat] because I wanted to be an athlete as well. It just got reiterated from such a young age that if you want to be an athlete you need to eat these animals, drink your milk, get your calcium and things like that. I struggled with it a lot.\u201d</p> <p>The film Earthlings, which explores the use of animals as pets, for science, for clothing and for food and is narrated by Joaquin Phoenix, triggered change quite brutally. \u201cIt ripped me apart to realise that I had been contributing to that. It destroyed me. From then I was like: \u2018OK, no more eating animals; it\u2019s cool, I can do that.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c94c4f2718d3ce002ea1038d1887601eb9eb6883\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c94c4f2718d3ce002ea1038d1887601eb9eb6883/0_111_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Katie Rood in action for Lewes against Arsenal in February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Katie Rood in action for Lewes against Arsenal in February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gavin Ellis/TGS Photo/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As well as benefiting physically, Rood found the psychological effect was massive. It made her question and reassess the world, society and its constructs. \u201cIf I\u2019ve been told that I need meat and milk to be a healthy athlete and I\u2019ve found the complete opposite to be true then what else have I been lied to about? And why don\u2019t we know this?\u201d</p> <p>Rood has embraced the example she can set as one of an increasing number of vegan athletes. She determined not to be preachy but says: \u201cThat\u2019s been a journey in and of itself, learning how to communicate with people on it, because it\u2019s a sensitive subject.\u201d</p> <p>When the subject is raised of how she, as an environmentalist, justifies flying around the world for her club football or for the New Zealand national team, a slightly pained expression tells of the battle that rages within her. \u201cI try use my platform as much as possible to bring awareness and help people realise and change positively for the environment.\u201d She knows she is justifying it and she does make sacrifices \u2013 she remained in England over Christmas \u2013 but tries to think bigger picture with football. \u201cObviously the better I do with the national team the better the profile I have. It\u2019s a constant battle though. I always thought football would be a vehicle to see the world and now it\u2019s my vehicle to try and save the world.\u201d</p> <p>Constantly grappling for solutions, she wonders whether clubs could commit to creating a \u201cfootball forest\u201d by planting trees to offset their flight emissions.</p> <p>A desire to be an active participant in changing things drew her towards the Extinction Rebellion protests. \u201cIt turned out to be a life-changing experience,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was one of the most beautiful things I\u2019ve ever participated in. Within minutes they had set up whole communities in the streets in London.\u201d</p> <p>She is proud of what it has achieved, the way it has changed the narrative around climate change. \u201cIt was full-on. It made a difference right? We weren\u2019t really talking about climate change beforehand.

Stuck in England, Rood has constructed a makeshift gym and garden pitch to try to maintain some level of training.</p> <p>The harder part, she says, with Covid-19 and Sars apparently having some connection to markets where live and dead animals are sold, is that such pandemics may have stemmed from human exploitation of animals.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to bring that up as a discussion point in a way that\u2019s really sensitive and understanding of the grief and trauma and stress that people are under. So mostly I\u2019ve kept quiet about that, it\u2019s not really the time or place, but I don\u2019t know when we\u2019re ever going to find a better one. It would maybe be too much of a stretch to say it doesn\u2019t happen in a world where we don\u2019t eat animals but I think the key is that this crisis was predicted and more are predicted if we continue to eat and treat animals the way that we do.</p> <p>\u201cWe create the perfect environment for diseases in the way we treat animals. It\u2019s a hard one to discuss with people but hopefully I\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is has also made her reflect on possible changes to the relationship between society and nature. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be quite profound in that a lot of people are connecting with nature for the first time, or the first time in a while, and in a way in which they haven\u2019t before and that\u2019s exciting and powerful,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cYou see the images of people in India seeing the Himalayas for the first time from their cities because the smog has pretty much lifted.

I don\u2019t think you can deny things like that. This is happening all across the globe where we\u2019re seeing air pollution disperse.

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Global number of infections passes 3.3m</h2> <p>At least 3,334,406<strong> </strong>people have been infected and at least 238,787 have died around the world since the pandemic began, according to researchers from Johns Hopkins University.</p> <p>The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the scale of the outbreak due to suspected underreporting, as well as differing testing and statistical regimes.</p> <h2>UK minister accused of artificially boosting test numbers</h2> <p>UK health secretary Matt Hancock <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/ministers-accused-of-changing-covid-19-test-tally-to-hit-100000-goal\">has been accused of changing the criteria for counting</a> Covid-19 tests after he claimed victory in reaching the target of 100,00 per day. But critics said that a large proportion of the 122,000 tests counted on Friday were tests that had been mailed to addresses and had not been carried out.</p> <h2>White House blocks Anthony Fauci from testifying</h2> <p>Top US health official Anthony Fauci will not testify next week to a congressional committee examining the Trump administration\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic, the White House said on Friday, calling it \u201ccounterproductive\u201d to have individuals involved in the response testify. Also in the US, a New York nursing home has reported 98 residents <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/02/new-york-nursing-home-reports-98-coronavirus-deaths-in-horrifying-outbreak\">have died from the disease</a>.</p> <h2>Somali medics report rapid rise in deaths</h2> <p>Medics, funeral workers and gravediggers in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/somalia\">Somalia</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/02/somali-medics-report-rapid-rise-in-deaths-as-covid-19-fears-grow\">have reported an unprecedented surge of deaths </a>in recent days amid growing fears that official counts of Covid-19 deaths reflect only a fraction of the virus\u2019s toll in Africa .</p> <h2>Singapore to ease restrictions as cases subside again</h2> <p>Singapore\u2019s health minister says the city-state will relax some anti-coronavirus measures after a fall in the number of cases in the broader community. Some businesses will be allowed to open again after 12 May while some schools will reopen from 19 May. Singapore saw cases flare up recently in a second wave as infections spiked<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/singapore-coronavirus-outbreak-surges-with-3000-new-cases-in-three-days\"> in its crowded migrant worker dormitories</a>.</p> <h2>US congress investigating Carnival Cruise Line</h2> <p>The US congress has launched an investigation into the conduct of Carnival Cruise Line over its response to the coronavirus pandemic, questioning why the company did not act sooner to protect passengers and staff. Dozens of people have died and more than 1,500 confirmed Covid-19 infections have been recorded in connection with Carnival\u2019s ships, which saw major outbreaks at least nine ships including the Diamond Princess, the Zaandam and the Ruby Princess. Many cruise ship crew <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/01/no-one-comes-the-cruise-ship-crews-cast-adrift-by-coronavirus\">remain trapped</a> on board cruise ships around the world.</p> <h2>Malaysia rounds up undocumented migrants</h2> <p>Malaysian authorities are rounding up undocumented migrants as part of efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus, the country\u2019s police chief said late on Friday, after hundreds of migrants and refugees were detained in the capital Kuala Lumpur. Over 700 migrants were taken into custody, including young children and ethnic Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, during Friday\u2019s raid in a downtown area where thousands of migrants and asylum-seekers live, rights groups had said.</p>",
  "<p>Up to 2% of Moscow\u2019s population may be infected with coronavirus, the city\u2019s mayor warned on Saturday, as hospitals in the Russian capital were overwhelmed and another top government official tested positive.</p> <p>Covid-19 took hold relatively late in Russia, but is now growing fast, with the country showing the second-highest spread of the disease in the world. A record 9,623 new cases on Saturday indicated infections have not yet reached a plateau.</p> <p>If Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin\u2019s estimate is correct, that would mean more than 240,000 people may have the virus, four times official figures for the city. Hospitals in the capital are already at capacity, with television footage showing ambulances forced to wait for hours to deliver the infected.</p> <p>On Friday authorities announced the housing minister was the latest top official to test positive. Vladimir Putin has not been pictured in public for nearly a month and is working from his residence outside Moscow.</p> <p>There are fears outbreaks may have festered undetected in other areas that initially appeared to have escaped the worst ravages of the disease.</p> <p>In Somalia, medics, funeral workers and gravediggers have reported an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/02/somali-medics-report-rapid-rise-in-deaths-as-covid-19-fears-grow\">unprecedented surge of deaths</a> in recent days in the capital Mogadishu, suggesting official counts of Covid-19 deaths -- currently just 601 confirmed cases and 28 deaths -- reflect only a fraction of the virus\u2019s toll.</p> <p>Mohamed Osman Warsame, an ambulance driver, said he had transported between 15 and 18 corpses to cemeteries in the capital every day for the last two weeks, many times above the usual daily figure of between two and four. \u201cThere are a lot of deaths. It is like we are in a deadly war. People are dying so fast,\u201d Warsame said.</p> <p>On the island of Bali, an entire hamlet has been locked down after rapid testing showed hundreds of residents were probably infected, <a href=\"https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/05/01/bali-hamlet-put-under-lockdown-after-tests-indicate-over-400-people-reactive-to-virus.html\">the Jakarta Post</a> reported. Out of 1,200 initial tests, 400 returned a reactive result; authorities will follow up with swab tests to confirm infection rates.</p> <p>Increasingly intense efforts to stop the spread of the disease have raised concerns about human rights and civil liberties. Malaysia has been criticised by the UN after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/02/malaysia-cites-covid-19-for-rounding-up-hundreds-of-migrants\">detaining hundreds of undocumented migrants</a>, including young children and Rohingya refugees, as part of its efforts to contain coronavirus.</p> <p>The UN said the arrests could push vulnerable groups into hiding and prevent them from seeking treatment, and warned that overcrowded detention centres carried a high risk of increasing the virus\u2019s spread.</p> <p>Privacy advocates in India have also attacked a government order that all public and private sector employees should use a government-backed Bluetooth tracing app, as New Delhi begins easing some of its lockdown measures in lower-risk areas.</p> <p>Critics warn that it is unclear how the data will be used. They stress India lacks privacy laws to govern the app. New Delhi has said the app will not infringe on privacy as all data is collected anonymously.</p> <p>Worldwide there are now 3.4 million cases of coronavirus and more than 238,000 deaths, although many countries that have passed the peak of their infections are now working on relaxing their lockdown restrictions.</p> <p>Singapore\u2019s health minister said on Saturday that it will start easing some curbs after a second wave of the coronavirus concentrated in the state\u2019s crowded migrant worker dormitories appeared to subside, with some students allowed back to school later this month.</p> <p>In Spain on Saturday adults were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/02/fear-tempers-relief-in-madrid-as-spain-begins-to-ease-coronavirus-lockdown\">allowed out to exercise</a> for the first time since March; as the country goes back to work, the government has made facemasks compulsory on buses, tubes and trains. Nearly 15 million will be handed out by authorities and charities.</p> <p>All governments, however, are moving cautiously, for fear of a second wave. In China the northeastern city of Harbin shut-dine in services at restaurants and cafes as the rest of the country was easing restrictions for the May Day holiday.</p> <p>Mainland China reported only one new case on Saturday, but Heilongjiang province is currently dealing with the country\u2019s biggest remaining coronavirus cluster, with half of 140 recent local transmissions, according to a Reuters tally.</p> <p>In the US, Australia and the UK, there has been a focus on how and why residential facilities have become deadly incubators for the disease.</p> <p>A nursing home in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york\">New York</a> has reported a \u201chorrifying\u201d death toll of 98 people from the coronavirus, one of the worst outbreaks in the country and a shock even in hard-hit New York. An official state tally of nursing home deaths had previously listed only 13 as of Friday.</p> <p>In the UK, the coronavirus death toll increased sharply this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/uk-records-4343-care-home-coronavirus-deaths-in-a-fortnight\">after officials began counting fatalities from the country\u2019s nursing homes</a> alongside deaths in hospitals.

  "<p>For fans of televised sport, there will always be that golden Sunday, in July last year, when the broadcast of a topsy-turvy Wimbledon final overlapped with a British Grand Prix <em>and</em> England\u2019s blockbuster victory in the Cricket World Cup. Oh my Djokovic: an unimprovable time to be an armchair spectator, an afternoon of channel-hopping and ad-dodging, hurrying wees and tea brews, juggling screens and streams and replays till we sweated like athletes ourselves.</p> <p>Unthinkable, then, that 10 months on, the sport schedules would be empty. Wimbledon 2020 is off. The cricket season has been picked apart. Everything from motorsport to football to darts has been put on hold while the world deals with coronavirus.</p> <p>What are we left with? How are fans, broadcasters and sportspeople themselves coping with the dearth of live competition on TV? On a recent Sunday evening, the hero of last summer\u2019s Cricket World Cup, Ben Stokes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/02/england-cricketer-ben-stokes-signs-up-to-race-in-virtual-f1-grand-prix\" title=\"\">agreed to take part in a virtual </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/02/england-cricketer-ben-stokes-signs-up-to-race-in-virtual-f1-grand-prix\" title=\"\">grand </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/02/england-cricketer-ben-stokes-signs-up-to-race-in-virtual-f1-grand-prix\" title=\"\">prix</a> that was broadcast at primetime on Sky. It was a kind of high-end Mario Kart that, with some squinting, looked almost as good as the real thing. But it was fatally devoid of risk. The seriousness of the contest never fully recovered after a restless Stokes started speeding backwards around the track, colliding with drivers coming the other way. One of the cars was piloted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/02/liam-payne-on-life-after-one-direction-it-was-touch-and-go-i-was-slowly-losing-the-plot\">Liam Payne</a>. I decided then that virtual sports were not going to cut it for me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"21e33be58446138d07dbc1a081817de76cf75497\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21e33be58446138d07dbc1a081817de76cf75497/37_0_1258_728/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Screen shot of cricketer Ben Stokes taking part in a virtual grand prix on Sky in April\" width=\"1000\" height=\"579\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Stokes taking part in a virtual grand prix in April. Will he catch Jenson Button?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: F1 Esports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For a while I managed my cravings for sports programming \u2013 15 hours a week, pre-pandemic \u2013 by taking in a diet of football documentaries, season-in-review DVDs and YouTube clips of outrageous or obscure goals from years gone by. A striker for Brighton, I remembered, vaguely, had scored a last-minute <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/8370901/glenn-murrays-nods-in-winner-with-his-crotch-as-brighton-see-off-west-brom-in-fa-cup-replay/\">goal with his penis</a> in 2019. I watched the clip several times.</p> <p>The documentaries were more nourishing, especially the multi-hour Netflix series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/27/sunderlands-til-i-die-second-series-fans-stress-spanners-dismay\">Sunderland \u2019Til I Die</a> that charted, in immaculate turn-by-turn detail, the fortunes of the north-east club as it moved between the lower leagues. Viewers were introduced to fans for whom watching footie was more than just a diversion, it was a crutch. I was especially taken by a diehard called Michelle Barraclough who hadn\u2019t missed a Sunderland game in years.</p> <p>I called up Barraclough, one afternoon, to ask how she was coping. She\u2019d watched something like 20 hours of live sport a week, before the lockdown, and had now gone a fortnight without. The country\u2019s response to the coronavirus, she told me, had made her question her hero-worship of footballers in the past. \u201cFootball feels very small in the grand scheme of things,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople can\u2019t see their families. I haven\u2019t seen my five-year-old granddaughter since the lockdown started. If I told anyone, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m missing the football,\u2019 they\u2019d probably give me a slap.\u201d</p> <p>There was a pause. But are you missing the football, I asked? \u201cOh <em>God,</em> yeah,\u201d she said. \u201cMassively. Massively.\u201d</p> <p>I was, too. I\u2019d heard there were armchair fans out there who were looking east for their fix. Leagues had been suspended in England, Scotland, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. But not in Belarus, where the Premier League season kicked off in late March. A team from the outskirts of Minsk called Energetik (they\u2019d been rechristened to honour the Belarusian state energy company) won the opening game of the season 3-1. Energetik then went on to beat the incumbent league champions and had a chance to go top of the league, if they could beat their local rivals, Minsk.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b8549ba9cac95bd03328d1930326093a763b800b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8549ba9cac95bd03328d1930326093a763b800b/0_783_2362_1447/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of a table tennis bat with  a ball shaped like a cornovarius\" width=\"1000\" height=\"613\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018An afternoon of Ukrainian table tennis was like watching events from space.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Gym Class/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I watched the derby live. Energetik scored in the first half. They had a player sent off in the second. They won the game in injury time, their goalie running the length of the pitch to celebrate with his teammates while, at my end, in my bedroom in London, I gave my laptop a celebratory waggle and clicked to close the small pop-up window I\u2019d been watching in. One of the gambling websites, Bet365, held streaming rights to the Belarusian league and this was the only way to watch along: a square of video the size of a couple of postage stamps, surrounded by flashing sports odds and gaudy ads for an Irish-themed casino game called Spin O\u2019Reely.</p> <p>Production-wise, it wasn\u2019t quite what I was used to: there was no commentary, only the sound of huffing players and (crystal clear) the Energetik coach screaming angry criticism at his players and the ref. Even so, I found myself looking forward to the next round of fixtures, in a week\u2019s time.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re watching football from Belarus? Getting your hit wherever you can find it, eh? You\u2019re like someone who\u2019s run out of single malt whiskey and has started drinking hand sanitiser.\u201d This was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/09/james-o-brien-interview-lbc\">James O\u2019Brien, the LBC radio presenter</a>, who I\u2019d called up at home. O\u2019Brien, who used to watch about eight hours of live sport a week, was one of the first to wonder aloud what its absence would be doing to the nation\u2019s mental health, and I was curious to know how he was managing. \u201cI\u2019m not watching Belarusian football, no,\u201d said O\u2019Brien, \u201cbut there is a massive gap that\u2019s been left and nothing is quite filling it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c783825a8551aa6753602c83f015f7b679fa5c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c783825a8551aa6753602c83f015f7b679fa5c1/0_25_4336_2921/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In this photo taken on Thursday, March 19, 2020, players are in action during the Belarus Championship soccer match between Energetik-BGU and Bate in Minsk, Belarus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"674\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Energetik take on Minsk in the Belarus Premier League in March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sergei Grits/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On his radio show, he said, he was hearing from dozens of people every day as they described their lives in this strange and unsettling period. \u201cAnd this has really come across to me, speaking to people, how hard it has been to find moments of mental space. I see now that sport was one of those doorways to a clear mind. I realise what value it had, emotionally. Because there was the distraction of the sport itself \u2013 but, almost as important, there was the comfort and reassurance that the sport was <em>there</em>.\u201d He said he still found himself flicking to \u201cthe 400s\u201d \u2013 the sports channels on Sky \u2013 just in case.</p> <p>What else was still showing live on TV and online? There was Australian horse racing, but it didn\u2019t start till the middle of the night. Malaysian volleyball? Russian ice hockey? I settled, in the end, for an afternoon of Ukrainian table tennis, following the progress of a pale and furious young player called Vadim Smetenko, who happened to be on a winning streak that day. The physically distanced players squeaked around a leisure centre, footage of the matches shot using a fixed camera above the table, the sound coming in and out, and the feed occasionally rippling with distortion. It was all a little like watching events from space.</p> <p>Soon it was time to watch Energetik play their next fixture. It was a bleak affair, and not only because they were beaten 2-0 by a team called Torpedo. \u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d O\u2019Brien had said, \u201cthat Belarusian football is a market you want to be supporting at the moment. What, have they discovered something about coronavirus the rest of us haven\u2019t?\u201d He was right. Belarus was currently the only country in Europe with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/29/belarus-football-continues-coronavirus-premier-league\" title=\"\">an active football competition</a>. The country did not seem to have any special handle on the problem of coronavirus; its sports administrators had just decided to carry on regardless. The country\u2019s president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/alexander-lukashenko\">Alexander Lukashenko</a>, made the questionable claim that sport should not only be allowed to continue but that<strong> </strong>it \u201cis the best <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2020/mar/29/there-are-no-viruses-here-belarus-president-plays-ice-hockey-amid-covid-19-pandemic-video\">anti-virus remedy</a>\u201d. The chief of Fifpro, the world footballers\u2019 union, had described the situation as \u201cnot comprehendible\u201d. Wishing Energetik well, I decided to let the Belarusian Premier League carry on without me.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Watching sport, you can be irrational, or elated, or fuming angry, or goosebumpy.

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ufc\">Ultimate Fighting Championship</a>, a mixed martial arts competition based in the US, was preparing to build a ring on a remote private island, in order to avoid stay-at-home orders and continue staging bouts. The pro-wrestling federation, <a href=\"https://www.wwe.com/\">WWE</a>, had somehow secured \u201cessential\u201d business status from a sympathetic governor in Florida and would thus be able to continue some degree of live broadcasting. Other sports sought to push through the lockdown in a milder way, embracing the challenges posed by the moment and tweaking their rules and settings to become isolation-friendly.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCygUhvsu653-ldNvT4Wr_pw\" title=\"\">They were putting on internet darts</a>, for instance. A group of top players had agreed to play from their homes, with a webcam pointed at their dartboards, earpieces telling them when to throw, a tablet showing the scores, and two referees watching along on Zoom. The results were broadcast in split-screen on YouTube.</p> <p>And I tried to love it. I so admired internet darts, for the effort involved, and the example being set. But all I was really watching was a pair of physically distanced dartboards and the jerky appearance of arrows that had been thrown by an invisible hand.</p> <p>Meanwhile I\u2019d been learning a lot about the anatomy of a sports obsession. To be properly compelling, I knew now, sport had to be live. It had to have consequences. And it had to be human. I wanted to watch human achievement, but more than that I wanted to watch humans achieving.</p> <p>Perhaps I would find what I was missing in the world of basketball. The sport\u2019s governing body, <a href=\"https://www.nba.com/\">the NBA</a>, had organised a stay-at-home free-throw competition, with male and female pros competing against each other from their gardens and driveways while a studio host kept score. They leapt about. They chuntered and teased each other, completing nifty, unlikely throws from all angles until one of them triumphed. I didn\u2019t have the right subscription channel to see the action as it happened, so I found the replays online and followed along as if they were live \u2013 squinting where necessary to avoid accidentally discovering the results in the page furniture, and eventually leaning a book against the bottom of my screen to hide the absolute spoiler pit that was the comments section.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0a3acb7287970f7e4df7ce0965f6dd23a65aba2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a3acb7287970f7e4df7ce0965f6dd23a65aba2f/0_100_2362_2133/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of  hand with finger up, balancing a baseball shaped like a cornovarius\" width=\"1000\" height=\"903\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Perhaps I would find what I was missing in the world of basketball.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Gym Class/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Epiphany! If I could enjoy a backyard basketball competition (watched on delay, cowering from spoilers, simulating live conditions), why not a historical sporting contest with some more meat on the bone? I messaged friends whose knowledge of American sports went anorak-deep. What had I missed in recent seasons? What was out there, online, that I was ignorant of and could watch as if it were live? We put together a bill of fare, plucking the better games from three major American sports. A starter of ice hockey (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x18EQERgJQ\">Maple Leafs v</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x18EQERgJQ\"> Flyers</a>), a main of basketball (<a href=\"https://www.nba.com/playoffs/2019/finals#/\">Raptors v</a><a href=\"https://www.nba.com/playoffs/2019/finals#/\"> Warriors</a>), baseball for pudding (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/oct/30/world-series-game-7-washington-nationals-v-houston-astros-live\">Nationals v</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/oct/30/world-series-game-7-washington-nationals-v-houston-astros-live\"> Astros</a>). It took hours to consume all this hand-picked good stuff. There was an epic penalty shootout. Two celebratory confetti showers! But something was off.</p> <p>When I knew to expect grand drama, I was impatient for it, and I started fast-forwarding for the sexy bits. Any thrills did not feel earned, and it occurred to me for the first time that one of the perverse appeals of live sport might be the obligatory waiting \u2013 all that hanging around for a result to land, worrying it might wind up being a hideous waste of time.</p> <p>\u201cSport speaks to the drama of the unknown,\u201d the president of Eurosport, Andrew Georgiou, told me. \u201cWe hope for something. But we don\u2019t know we\u2019re going to get it.\u201d At the outbreak of the crisis, as sport wound down and stopped, Eurosport lost something like 2,500 hours of planned-for live footage for the spring. Georgiou and his team had to hustle to fill the gaps with archive material and virtual sports. \u201cI\u2019m looking at my calendar for the week,\u201d he said, \u201cand everything\u2019s planned. I know exactly what I\u2019m doing every minute of the week. Live sport allows you to escape from the predictability of [that] and get into untold drama\u2026 The very reason I watch sport is because of that massive unpredictability.\u201d</p> <p>I agreed, and I found myself drifting back to the Ukrainian table tennis. Smetenko had won three thrillers in a row. There was something about knowing he was out there, swearing, squeaking in his trainers, that made him a more compelling watch than all the confetti-showered basketballers and baseballers put together.</p> <p>Taiwanese baseball. Tajik football. The search continued. I had to ask myself the serious question: if the UFC was successful in staging a brutal ultimate fight on a private island, would I be desperate enough to pay to watch? Katherine Brunt, a World Cup-winning England cricketer and former devourer of TV sport (12 hours a week), told me she had been wondering the same thing. She had always been a fan of mixed martial arts in her former, sport-watching life. The prospect of a fresh, live bout would be hard to resist.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7bc2b0f8809156e60b0d7b8a2623da3a3474a2f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7bc2b0f8809156e60b0d7b8a2623da3a3474a2f1/0_153_4300_2579/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Katherine Brunt (c) and Anya Shrubsole (r) of England Women celebrate England men winning the Final of the ICC Cricket World Cup against New Zealand during Day Three of the International Friendly match between England Women and Australia A Women at Millfield School on July 14, 2019 in Glastonbury, England.

I heartily agreed. Like gourmands reminiscing over some old, closed-down restaurant, we traded memories about that golden Sunday of TV sport last summer. While Stokes led the England men\u2019s team to glory, Brunt said, she had been watching on a TV with her teammates, after a match of their own. \u201cWe\u2019d just played Australia. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/jul/31/womens-ashes-england-v-australia-third-final-t20-live-cricket\">Absolutely spanked them</a>.\u201d But do you know what, Brunt added? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/england-win-cricket-world-cup-and-for-once-the-nation-really-was-watching\">Watching the men\u2019s team win</a> on TV was almost better.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re playing, you can\u2019t let your emotions get the best of you. You have to almost turn your real feelings down a bit. When you\u2019re watching sport, though, you can let it <em>all</em> out.\u201d There happened to be a photographer on site that day, and he captured Brunt, in a moment of spectator-sport bliss, overturning the nearest chair. \u201cWatching sport, you can be irrational, or elated, or fuming angry, or goosebumpy,\u201d she told me. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why we need it.\u201d</p> <p>She said goodbye. Off, maybe, to watch some fight clips on YouTube. I had a choice to make myself, between Swedish horse racing and the next round of internet darts.

Trump\u2019s \u201cnavigable waters protection rule\u201d, which was published in January, narrows the definition of waterways to exclude ephemeral streams, wetlands, creeks and other headwaters which do not have visible water 365 days a year because they run intermittently or temporarily underground. For example, 90% of streams that connect to the Colorado river, which supplies water to seven western US states and two in northern Mexico, run only after rainfall or snowmelt.</p> <p>The rule, which has attracted widespread criticism from scientists, environmentalists, and the tourism sector, replaces an Obama era regulation that strengthened protection for about 60% of the nation\u2019s interconnected waterways. But it goes much further than just repealing Obama\u2019s 2015 rule, by allowing landowners and developers to dump directly into hundreds of thousands of waterways, and to destroy or fill in wetlands for construction projects.</p> <p>\u201cAccess to clean water is a fundamental right for all Americans.

This never happened.'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Joe Biden has emphatically denied a sexual assault allegation against him, breaking weeks of silence to address the accusation that has roiled his campaign. </p> <p>\u201c<strong>They aren\u2019t true. This never happened</strong>,\u201d he said in a statement, released moments before his Friday appearance on Morning Joe. </p> <p>Tara Reade accused Biden of sexually assaulting her in the basement of an office building on Capitol Hill in 1993, when she was an aide in his Senate office. His campaign refuted the allegation in a statement, but this is Biden\u2019s first public comment on the accusation.</p> <p>He also calls on the National Archives to release any record of a complaint Reade said she filed. </p> <p>Here is the statement in its entirety: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>April was Sexual Assault Awareness Month. Every year, at this time, we talk about awareness, prevention, and the importance of women feeling they can step forward, say something, and be heard. That belief \u2013 that women should be heard \u2013 was the underpinning of a law I wrote over 25 years ago. To this day, I am most proud of the Violence Against Women Act. So, each April we are reminded not only of how far we have come in dealing with sexual assault in this country \u2013 but how far we still have to go.</p> <p>When I wrote the bill, few wanted to talk about the issue. It was considered a private matter, a personal matter, a family matter. I didn\u2019t see it that way. To me, freedom from fear, harm, and violence for women was a legal right, a civil right, and a human right. And I knew we had to change not only the law, but the culture. <br><br>So, we held hours of hearings and heard from the most incredibly brave women \u2013 and we opened the eyes of the Senate and the nation \u2013 and passed the law.<br><br>In the years that followed, I fought to continually strengthen the law. So, when we took office and President Obama asked me what I wanted, I told him I wanted oversight of the critical appointments in the Office on Violence Against Women at the Department of Justice and I wanted a senior White House Advisor appointing directly to me on the issue. Both of those things happened.<br><br>As Vice President, we started the \u201cIt\u2019s on Us\u201d campaign on college campuses to send the message loud and clear that dating violence is violence \u2013 and against the law. <br><br>We had to get men involved. They had to be part of the solution. That\u2019s why I made a point of telling young men this was their problem too \u2013 they couldn\u2019t turn a blind eye to what was happening around them \u2013 they had a responsibility to speak out. Silence is complicity. <br><br>In the 26 years since the law passed, the culture and perceptions have changed but we\u2019re not done yet.<br><br>It\u2019s on us, and it\u2019s on me as someone who wants to lead this country. I recognize my responsibility to be a voice, an advocate, and a leader for the change in culture that has begun but is nowhere near finished. So I want to address allegations by a former staffer that I engaged in misconduct 27 years ago.<br><br>They aren\u2019t true. This never happened.</p> <p>While the details of these allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault are complicated, two things are not complicated. One is that women deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and when they step forward they should be heard, not silenced. The second is that their stories should be subject to appropriate inquiry and scrutiny. <br><br>Responsible news organizations should examine and evaluate the full and growing record of inconsistencies in her story, which has changed repeatedly in both small and big ways. <br><br>But this much bears emphasizing.<br><br>She has said she raised some of these issues with her supervisor and senior staffers from my office at the time. They \u2013 both men and a woman \u2013 have said, unequivocally, that she never came to them and complained or raised issues. News organizations that have talked with literally dozens of former staffers have not found one \u2013 not one \u2013 who corroborated her allegations in any way. Indeed, many of them spoke to the culture of an office that would not have tolerated harassment in any way \u2013 as indeed I would not have.<br><br>There is a clear, critical part of this story that can be verified. The former staffer has said she filed a complaint back in 1993. But she does not have a record of this alleged complaint. The papers from my Senate years that I donated to the University of Delaware do not contain personnel files. It is the practice of Senators to establish a library of personal papers that document their public record: speeches, policy proposals, positions taken, and the writing of bills. <br><br>There is only one place a complaint of this kind could be \u2013 the National Archives. The National Archives is where the records are kept at what was then called the Office of Fair Employment Practices. I am requesting that the Secretary of the Senate ask the Archives to identify any record of the complaint she alleges she filed and make available to the press any such document. If there was ever any such complaint, the record will be there.<br><br>As a Presidential candidate, I\u2019m accountable to the American people. We have lived long enough with a President who doesn\u2019t think he is accountable to anyone, and takes responsibility for nothing. That\u2019s not me. I believe being accountable means having the difficult conversations, even when they are uncomfortable. People need to hear the truth.<br><br>I have spent my career learning from women the ways in which we as individuals and as policy makers need to step up to make their hard jobs easier, with equal pay, equal opportunity, and workplaces and homes free from violence and harassment. I know how critical women\u2019s health issues and basic women\u2019s rights are. That has been a constant through my career, and as President, that work will continue. And I will continue to learn from women, to listen to women, to support women, and yes, to make sure women\u2019s voices are heard.<br><br>We have a lot of work to do. From confronting online harassment, abuse, and stalking, to ending the rape kit backlog, to addressing the deadly combination of guns and domestic violence. <br><br>We need to protect and empower the most marginalized communities, including immigrant and indigenous women, trans women, and women of color. <br><br>We need to make putting an end to gender-based violence in both the United States and around the world a top priority. <br><br>I started my work over 25 years ago with the passage of the Violence Against Women Act. As president, I\u2019m committed to finishing the job.</p> </blockquote> <p>Read it <a href=\"https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-7a9593bd3012\">here</a>: </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-01T12:03:29.178Z\">at 1.03pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5eac004f8f08f76ffc19f64a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-01T11:59:37.376Z\">12.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Good morning \u2026</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>\u2026and welcome to another day of coverage of the coronavirus outbreak \u2013 and politics, both concerning the pandemic and tilted towards the election in November \u2013 in the US.</p> <p>The main news of the morning is that <strong>Joe Biden</strong>, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, will appear on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe to answer questions for the first time about <strong>an allegation of sexual assault against him</strong>. </p> <p>In advance of the interview, Biden issued a statement:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I recognize my responsibility to be a voice, an advocate, and a leader for the change in culture that has begun but is nowhere near finished.
