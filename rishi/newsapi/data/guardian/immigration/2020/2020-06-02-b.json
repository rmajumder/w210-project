At the end of March, the National Statistics Institute (INE), which calculates figures in a different way, gave Spain\u2019s jobless figure as 3.31 million. </p> \n  <p>These figures do not count those who have been furloughed. Between mid-March and the end of May, a total of 3.7 million people were furloughed under a plan rolled out by the labour ministry. But when the furlough scheme draws to a close as planned at the end of June, unemployment figures could rise again.</p> \n  <p>The government has urged employers not to cut jobs in the six months following the furlough period but layoffs are expected.</p> \n  <p>In May, as the lockdown was eased, the number of new jobseekers in the construction sector fell by almost 7% compared with April. In industry and agriculture, the figure remained stable but it grew by 1.5% in the service sector which has borne the brunt of the crisis, particularly due to the loss of significant numbers of temporary jobs in tourism.</p> \n  <p>In the first quarter, Spain\u2019s unemployment rate jumped to 14.4%, INE figures showed. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates unemployment in Spain could soar to 20.8% in 2020, while the government expects a figure of 19%.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed620748f084df971c8e11c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T09:51:50.518Z\">10.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Concerts have been allowed to restart in <strong>Portugal</strong>, with the country\u2019s prime minister, Antonio Costa, attending a show performed by Bruno Nogueira and Manuela Azevedo in Lisbon last night: </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2792c9abee454b49850e79e941da3a2c687fbb83\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2792c9abee454b49850e79e941da3a2c687fbb83/0_124_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Portuguese entertainer Bruno Nogueira\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Portuguese entertainer Bruno Nogueira performs during his show Deixem o Pimba em Paz at Campo Pequeno Arena in Lisbon on Monday.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patr\u00edcia de Melo Moreira/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c035f3b1055a602ea5f3571de64a4bb67138067\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c035f3b1055a602ea5f3571de64a4bb67138067/0_320_4804_2883/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa, center, and his wife Fernanda Tadeu applaud as the lights dim for the start of a concert by Portuguese artists Bruno Nogueira and Manuela Azevedo at the Campo Pequeno bullring in Lisbon on Monday.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Armando Franca/AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4fce9a63ca35328c39b8a4bc0a91eed408cf96a7\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fce9a63ca35328c39b8a4bc0a91eed408cf96a7/0_0_5000_3333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People wearing face masks attend a concert in Lisbon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People wearing face masks attend the performing show Deixem o Pimba em Paz by Portuguese entertainer Bruno Nogueira at Campo Pequeno Arena in Lisbon on Monday.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patr\u00edcia de Melo Moreira/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed61f598f087122eca53e97\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T09:46:02.315Z\">10.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Statistics watchdog criticises government's testing data</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Britain\u2019s statistics watchdog has again warned the health secretary, Matt Hancock, that figures on coronavirus tests remain \u201cfar from complete and comprehensible\u201d.</p> \n  <p>In a strongly-worded letter, Sir David Norgrove, chairman of the UK Statistics Authority, said the way the Government presented the figures appeared to be aimed at showing \u201cthe largest possible number of tests, even at the expense of understanding\u201d.

He is the sixth doctor from Wuhan Central Hospital to have died from the virus, which emerged in the central Chinese city late last year.</p> \n  <p>Cases have dwindled dramatically from the peak in mid-February as the country appears to have brought the outbreak largely under control. The official death toll in the country of 1.4 billion people stands at 4,634, well below the number of fatalities in less populous nations.</p> \n  <p>Wuhan Central Hospital has yet to give a formal statement on Hu\u2019s death. In early February it said some 68 staff members had contracted coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>Hu\u2019s condition became a national concern after Chinese media showed images of him with his skin turned black due to liver damage. Fellow doctor Yi Fan showed similar symptoms, but recovered and has since been discharged from hospital.</p> \n  <p>The death of their colleague Li Wenliang in February triggered a national outpouring of grief and rage against the government as he documented his final days on social media. The 34-year-old ophthalmologist was reprimanded by authorities after he warned colleagues about the virus in late December. Beijing has since named him a national martyr, but suppressed much of the dissent and criticism sparked by his death.</p> \n  <p>Other medical whistleblowers at Wuhan Central Hospital - including emergency unit director Ai Fen - have told Chinese media they were punished by authorities for speaking out.</p> \n  <p>China has not released a complete figure of the number of medical worker deaths from Covid-19, but at least 34 medics have been awarded posthumous honours by health authorities.

after multiple government labs had fully decoded it, not sharing details key to designing tests, drugs and vaccines.</p> \n  <p>AP reports that strict controls on information and competition within the Chinese public health system were largely to blame. The news agency says its report is based on internal documents, emails and dozens of interviews. </p> \n  <p>The AP report reads: </p> \n  <p><em>Health officials only released the genome after a Chinese lab published it ahead of authorities on a virology website on 11 January. Even then, China stalled for at least two weeks more on giving WHO the details it needed, according to recordings of multiple internal meetings held by the UN health agency in January all at a time when the outbreak arguably might have been dramatically slowed.</em></p> \n  <p><em>Although the World Health Organization continued to publicly commend China, the recordings obtained by the AP show they were concerned China was not sharing enough information to assess the risk posed by the new virus, costing the world valuable time. </em></p> \n  <p><em>\u201cWe\u2019re currently at the stage where yes, they\u2019re giving it to us 15 minutes before it appears on CCTV,\u201d said WHOs top official in China, Dr Gauden Galea, referring to the state-owned China Central Television, in one meeting.</em></p> \n  <p><em>The story behind the early response to the pandemic comes at a time when the UN health agency is under siege. President Trump cut ties with WHO on Friday, after blasting the agency for allegedly colluding with China to hide the extent of the epidemic. Chinese President Xi Jinping said China has always provided information to WHO and the world in a most timely fashion.</em></p> \n  <p><em>The new information does not support the narrative of either the US or China, but portrays an agency now stuck in the middle that was urgently trying to solicit more data. Although international law obliges countries to report information to WHO that could have an impact on public health, the UN agency has no enforcement powers.

The British Grand Prix will be held on 2 August and Silverstone\u2019s second race, designated the 70th Anniversary GP, will be on 9 August. The race is named to mark the first round of the opening championship held in 1950 at Silverstone.</p> <p>Barcelona will then stage the Spanish Grand Prix on 16 August.

  "<p>Carl Worswick\u2019s article provides some interesting new angles on this complicated story (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/28/bobby-moore-and-the-mystery-of-the-missing-bogota-bracelet\" title=\"\">Bobby Moore and the mystery of the missing Bogot\u00e1 bracelet</a>, 28 May). As I was charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires in Bogot\u00e1 on 18 May 1970 when the incident took place \u2013 the new ambassador, Tom Rogers, arrived on 22 May \u2013 I\u2019d like to clarify a few things.</p> <p>The questioning of Bobby Moore before the team\u2019s departure for Quito on 21 May was not part of the investigation by the National Police, but was done by a detective from DAS, a rival police force, at my suggestion. It aimed to show the complete confidence of the England party in his innocence.</p> <p>The return of the team to Bogot\u00e1 on 25 May was more dramatic than described. At the airport, our information officer, Julio Tobon, was tipped off that National Police detectives were there to arrest Moore. This would have meant humiliation for Moore and the risk of unhelpful headlines. I managed to persuade the detectives not to arrest him on the understanding that I would take him to make a voluntary statement to the magistrate. We were joined by Vicente Laverde, an excellent lawyer who defended Moore throughout for free.</p> <p>The hearing did not last until late at night as Worswick describes. The magistrate decided that Moore should be detained, but then agreed that he could be held at the house of Alfonso Senior, president of the Colombian FA. He stipulated two policemen to guard him but could not, as the article implies, provide them. That fell to me. I turned to the DAS again.

  "<p>Britain has vowed to build an international alliance of democracies going beyond \u201cthe usual suspects\u201d to force China to step back from the brink over its plans for a new national security law in Hong Kong.</p> <p>In a statement to MPs, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said that by threatening Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy, China \u201cwas inexplicably putting at risk what has long been regarded as one of [its] economic jewels\u201d.</p> <p>He also accused Beijing of intimidation in building a pro-China global alliance, saying Britain was trying to build its own counter-alliance of democracies to defend Hong Kong freedoms. He said the alliance needed to stretch beyond \u2018the usual suspects\u201d in Europe and the Five Eyes alliance to include countries in Africa and Latin America so drawing together countries with \u201ca likeminded attachment to the rule of law\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2020/jun/02/hong-kong-the-end-of-one-country-two-systems\">Hong Kong: the end of one country, two systems?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>&nbsp;Raab also clarified his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/29/three-million-hong-kong-residents-eligible-for-uk-citizenship\">offer last week of a path to citizenship</a> through an extendable right to stay for periods of 12 months was applicable at this stage only to the existing 300,000 Hong Kong British Nationals Overseas (BNO) passport holders. The offer, including a right to work and study, will extend the right to stay from six months to an extendable 12 months. He said the offer would be formally made only if China wentahead with its as-yet-unpublished security laws.</p> <p>He told MPs the UK offer was confined to the existing 300,000 BNO passport holders and their dependents in Hong Kong, and not to those eligible for a BNO passport but who do not currently hold one. He said the UK government had to be realistic about the numbers Britain could credibly and responsibly absorb.</p> <p>If the offer was extended to all those eligible for the BNO passport, as many as 2.5 million people would be entitled to come to the UK. On Friday, there had been suggestions that the offer would definitely to be extended to all those eligible to apply for a BNO.</p> <p>Raab also ruled out calls from some MPs to offer a UK visa to those not eligible to apply for the BNO. Many of the younger Hong Kong citizens at the centre of the protests against Chinese rule have never been eligible for BNO status as it is only available to those born before 1997.</p> <p>Revealing he had been looking at the BNO issue with the Home Office since September, he said the UK\u2019s offer met UK\u2019s moral responsibilities as a former colonial power. \u201cWe, as the UK, have historic responsibilities, a duty I would say, to the people of Hong Kong,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will stand by them, we will live up to our responsibilities,\u201d and added: \u201dWe have a proud tradition for standing up as a haven for those fleeing persecution\u201d,</p> <p>Raab told MPs: \u201cThere is time for China to reconsider. There is a moment for China to step back from the brink and respect Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy and respect China\u2019s own international obligations.</p> <p>\u201cIf China continues down this current path, if it enacts this national security law, we will consider what further response we make, working with those international partners and others,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can cross the Rubicon and violate the rights of the people of Hong Kong, or it can step back and understand the widespread concern of the international community\u201d.</p> <p>He insisted the proposed new law breached Beijing\u2019s international commitments to the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d principle in the former colony.</p> <p>A number of Conservative MPs demanded that the UK reset its relations with China, but Raab said he wanted to continue to cooperate with China on issues such as trade and climate change. </p> <p>Labour\u2019s shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, called for the UK government to \u201cstep up\u201d its response. She told MPs: \u201cIt is time for an international democratic alliance to come together and speak with one voice.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Interest rates have never been lower and lenders have slashed the cost of overdrafts. Normally that would be the signal for UK consumers to flash the plastic and take on more debt.</p> <p>Not this time. According to the Bank of England, households reduced their credit card bills and paid off their non-mortgage loans at a record rate in April. Consumers tend to get warier about borrowing when times are tough: they behaved similarly during the financial crisis of the late 2000s. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/jun/02/uk-consumers-repay-record-74bn-of-debt-amid-covid-19-lockdown\">a monthly debt repayment of \u00a37.4bn</a> is in a different league from anything seen before.</p> <p>Seen from one perspective, the repayment of debt is nothing to worry about. Consumers spent April confined to their homes and had little opportunity to blow the money provided either by their employer or by the government\u2019s wage subsidy scheme.</p> <p>Spending options were severely curtailed. Go out for a meal? Not possible because of the risk of catching the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19 </a>virus. Take out a loan to buy a new car? Not feasible with all the showrooms shut. Book a cruise and put it on the credit card? Summer \u2013 as confirmed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/jun/02/stocks-shrug-off-us-unrest-china-tensions-amid-easing-of-covid-19-lockdown-pound-oil-business-live\">P&amp;O\u2019s decision to suspend sailings until mid-October </a>\u2013 has been cancelled this year.</p> <p>As a result, households saved more and spent less. They used the period of lockdown to pay off debt and put their finances in order. As the lockdown restrictions are gradually eased, consumers will be in a stronger position and will make up for lost time with a surge of spending. The debt repayments of March and April will prove to be exceptional, as will the 80% drop in mortgage approvals and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/02/uk-house-prices-fall-coronavirus-nationwide\">fall in house prices </a>reported by the Nationwide building society.</p> <p>This all looks a tad panglossian. The reason consumers tend to save more of their disposable income during difficult times is that they feel the need to build up a financial buffer in case they lose their jobs, have their hours cut or find that their wages are not keeping pace with prices. With more than 8 million workers furloughed, that\u2019s true in spades this time.</p> <p>So, not all of the reduction in borrowing has been caused by a lack of spending opportunities. Some of it is due to consumers \u2013 quite rationally \u2013 being worried about what the future may bring. Those anxiety levels will remain high for some time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden\u00a0email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>How to help make the G20 function</h2> <p>It\u2019s easy to understand the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/02/gordon-brown-urges-g20-countries-to-back-25tn-coronavirus-plan\">frustration of the 225 members of the global great and good </a>who have written to the leaders of the G20 demanding a stronger international response to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19 </a>pandemic.</p> <p>The G20 \u2013 a gathering of the world\u2019s key developed, emerging market and developing nations \u2013 had its moment of glory during the financial crisis of the late 2000s. Now it is effectively moribund.</p> <p>The G20 showed in 2008-09 that it is capable of acting in a coordinated manner. During the financial crisis there was a collective stimulus, funding for the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and a commitment to avoid protectionism.</p> <p>Today the world faces an even bigger crisis and there is plenty that the G20 could be doing.</p> <p>It could be helping to make the health systems of poor countries more resilient. It could be co-ordinating efforts to finding a vaccine for the virus. It could be developing an action plan to rebuild the global economy with a green new deal. It could be ensuring there are the funds available to help the more than 100 countries that have applied to the IMF for help, and to prevent extreme poverty from rising. It could come up with a comprehensive debt relief plan.</p> <p>The G20 could be doing all these things and more but it has gone missing in action. While individual countries have responded quickly and decisively to the twin health and economic emergencies, the international response has been feeble.</p> <p>To turn the G20 into an effective body three things need to happen. Firstly, someone needs to provide the leadership that Gordon Brown showed in 2008-09. Secondly, relations need to be improved between the world\u2019s two biggest economies \u2013 the US and China. In the early years of the 21st century, Washington wanted Beijing to have a seat at the table when the big global issues were being discussed. Now, relations between the two countries are poisonous.</p> <p>Finally, there needs to be a recognition that collective action now is the best way to minimise the risk of a second wave of Covid-19 later this year. Otherwise, the G20 is a pointless relic.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cThe most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes,\u201d is how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/boris-johnson-cooperation-coronavirus-vaccine-bid#maincontent\">Boris Johnson described</a> the search for a coronavirus vaccine just a month ago. At the time, the prime minister urged countries to pull together and share their expertise. Yet if his government\u2019s actions are anything to go by, it seems more interested in siding with big pharmaceutical corporations than turning vaccine research into a genuinely collective endeavour.</p> <p>The last straw came on Friday, when the government refused to support <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/covid-19-technology-access-pool/solidarity-call-to-action/\">a World Health Organi</a><a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/covid-19-technology-access-pool/solidarity-call-to-action/\">zation initiative</a> to encourage countries to share research on coronavirus treatments and produce any final medicines patent-free. This would mean they could be distributed fairly according to need.&nbsp;The proposal, a voluntary scheme that would pool knowledge, intellectual property and data about coronavirus health technologies, is not particularly radical \u2013 but you wouldn\u2019t guess that from the recent protestations of pharmaceutical corporations.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b964cfb2-5f2e-4cb7-b9ad-535481495eaa\">Pfizer called the proposal \u201cnonsense\u201d</a>, while the big British companies working on coronavirus treatments, AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKlein, refused to participate. When asked whether he would attend the launch of the WHO proposal, Thomas B Cueni, the director of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wMMwDshed0&amp;t=64m23s\">International Federation of Phamaceutical Manufacturers and Associations,</a> a lobbying group, said he was \u201ctoo busy\u201d.</p> <p>The reaction from this industry shouldn\u2019t surprise us. Over the past three decades, big pharma has used its unparalleled lobbying muscle to secure market monopolies that vastly increase the power it holds over governments. Thanks to trade rules known as Trips (trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights) that were developed in the 90s to enforce minimum patent standards around the world,<strong> </strong>these corporations enjoy monopoly protection for new medicines they manufacture, allowing them to charge any price the market will endure.</p> <p>These rules provide little incentive to produce the medicines desperately needed to treat illnesses common in low-income countries, such as sleeping sickness and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/01/cholera-and-coronavirus-why-we-must-not-repeat-the-same-mistakes\">cholera</a>, but rather promote a narrow focus on drugs that mitigate chronic conditions common in the west, such as statins to treat high cholesterol. With chronic conditions, big pharmaceutical companies can sell the same medicines to the same patients for years, or even decades. Vaccines \u2013 designed to prevent diseases&nbsp;\u2013 are often used only once, and therefore don\u2019t tend to be as profitable.</p> <p>Governments have poured phenomenal sums of money into drug development to stimulate essential medical research that patents have failed to incentivise. But this money \u2013 like the UK government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-announces-record-funding-to-find-a-coronavirus-vaccine\">\u00a3500m</a><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-announces-record-funding-to-find-a-coronavirus-vaccine\"> of coronavirus research funding</a> \u2013 rarely comes with any strings attached, allowing pharmaceutical companies to monopolise the resulting medicines. A recent study estimated that one contender for a coronavirus treatment, a hepatitis C medication produced by the pharma giant Gilead, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e72d0ed3-11c7-43f6-a5e4-53e446f1e5a2\">costs $5 per course to produce</a>. The academics who authored the study said the drug is currently on sale in the US for more than $18,000 per treatment course.</p> <p>Despite the fact coronavirus medicines will be discovered using vast sums of public money, the NHS may still have to pay through the nose for any final product, while poorer countries could be unable to access the drug. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time this has happened. In the 90s<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/dec/19/theobserver.uknews6\">, millions died unnecessarily in the A</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/dec/19/theobserver.uknews6\">ids crisis in sub-Saharan Africa</a>, because the medicines to treat HIV were out of reach of most people.&nbsp;</p> <p>The WHO\u2019s initiative launched on Friday is intended to avert a repeat of this. Many countries, rich and poor, support it \u2013 including Argentina, Mexico, South Africa, Norway, Portugal and Belgium. But for the British government, the patent system is sacrosanct. The UK seems desperate not to upset its own pharmaceutical corporations or the financial sector that makes substantial returns from these companies, which spend <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/14/business/big-pharma-spends-on-share-buybacks-but-rd-not-so-much.html\">more money on share buybacks</a> than on researching drugs.</p> <p>Two weeks ago, British <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/17/us-and-uk-lead-push-against-global-patent-pool-for-covid-19-drugs\">officials attempted to</a> water down a resolution at the World Health Assembly to create a global \u201cpatent pool\u201d, which would have encouraged the production of patent-free coronavirus drugs. Then, on Friday, they declined to support the new WHO initiative for pooling research. Given the base of big pharma in the US and the UK, the withholding of support by industry and governments in these countries could easily scupper the WHO\u2019s plans.&nbsp;</p> <p>At that point it will be up to individual governments to use their power to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/15/coronavirus-treatment-drug-companies\">override corporate patents</a>. Nations including Germany, Canada, Chile, Israel and Ecuador have expressed their willingness to do so. This is perfectly legal, although big pharmaceutical companies might hope to convince us otherwise.&nbsp;</p> <p>There\u2019s reason to believe that the British government has misjudged the public mood significantly. Recent polling in Britain and the US shows public support for making <a href=\"https://wellcome.ac.uk/reports/what-people-think-about-global-access-covid-19-treatments-and-vaccines\">coronavirus medicines available internationally based on need</a>, rather than ability to pay. And pharmaceutical companies have been careful to appear sympathetic to the need for \u201cfair and equal access\u201d to coronavirus treatments. Some, like <a href=\"https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2020/astrazeneca-advances-response-to-global-covid-19-challenge-as-it-receives-first-commitments-for-oxfords-potential-new-vaccine.html\">AstraZeneca</a>, have even pledged to supply vaccines at \u201ccost price\u201d during the pandemic. But with big pharma, each word needs to be carefully interrogated. As these companies have admitted, such pledges will have <a href=\"https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2020/astrazeneca-advances-response-to-global-covid-19-challenge-as-it-receives-first-commitments-for-oxfords-potential-new-vaccine.html\">limited impact on the corporation\u2019s profits</a> because of vast public coronavirus subsidies.&nbsp;</p> <p>When it comes to the crunch, pharmaceutical companies treat healthcare as a commodity, not a right. If anything good comes of coronavirus, we may hope that&nbsp;it deepens the public understanding of the system\u2019s failures, allowing us to build a genuinely public system of medical research and development. The WHO initiative could be the first step in that direction.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>\u2022 </strong>Nick Dearden is director of Global Justice Now (formerly World Development Movement)</p>",

Cities still have a future, but the specific kind of&nbsp;city&nbsp;that has become globally dominant today shouldn\u2019t have a place in it.</p> <p>In&nbsp;places&nbsp;like London and New York, the development model over the past few decades has catered to the needs of elite individuals, powerful corporations and wealthy investors.

Governments have pursued private sector profitability and deferred to middle-class tastes, and have been lauded by urbanists for doing so \u2013 all while allowing the deterioration of social services and public institutions&nbsp;and the intensification of inequality.</p> <p>Even before the pandemic, this paradigm was a disaster. A set of intersecting crises has made urban life increasingly difficult for all but the wealthy. Housing has become unaffordable and insecure. Work has become casualised and wages have stagnated, leaving many workers unable to sustain an adequate standard of living. Despite pretensions towards multiculturalism, a white power structure has maintained <a href=\"https://www.runnymedetrust.org/projects-and-publications/equality-and-integration/london-ethnic-inequalities.html\">racialised inequalities</a> in nearly all aspects of economic and political life, including <a href=\"http://www.irr.org.uk/news/the-london-clearances-a-background-paper-on-race-housing-and-policing/\">housing</a>, <a href=\"https://europepmc.org/article/med/26665383\">health</a> and <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/met-police-cressida-dick-no-longer-institutionally-racist-racism-black-officer-a9001176.html\">policing</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s this&nbsp;urban model&nbsp;that has&nbsp;proved&nbsp;highly vulnerable to the Covid-19 pandemic.

The reaction to the pandemic shows that the structures sustaining the unequal city are movable \u2013 and can be altered faster than had been assumed.</p> <p>As cities begin to change in response to the pandemic, it\u2019s crucial that they don\u2019t return to their previous trajectory. The real threat is not that urban life will disappear, but that the inequality and injustice of&nbsp;the&nbsp;urban status quo&nbsp;will persist.</p> <ul> <li><p>David Madden is a sociologist and co-director of the Cities Programme at the London School of Economics</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Key developments in the global&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a>&nbsp;today include:</p> <h2><strong>Wuhan doctor dies after four-month illness</strong></h2> <p>A Wuhan doctor who worked with the coronavirus whistleblower Li Wenliang&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/02/coronavirus-live-news-dr-fauci-says-he-hasnt-spoken-to-trump-in-two-weeks-as-pakistanis-told-to-live-with-virus?page=with:block-5ed618ca8f084df971c8e0c9#block-5ed618ca8f084df971c8e0c9\">died of the virus last week</a>, state media reported, becoming China\u2019s first Covid-19 fatality in weeks. Hu Weifeng, a urologist at Wuhan central hospital, died on Friday after being treated for Covid-19 and related issues for more than four months, state broadcaster CCTV said. Meanwhile city-wide testing of 9.9 million people between 14 May and 1 June found no new cases of Covid-19, and&nbsp;300 asymptomatic cases. China does not count asymptomatic cases, meaning people who are infected with the virus but do not exhibit symptoms of the disease, as confirmed cases.</p> <h2>Chinese officials delayed releasing virus genome for over a week</h2> <p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/02/coronavirus-live-news-dr-fauci-says-he-hasnt-spoken-to-trump-in-two-weeks-as-pakistanis-told-to-live-with-virus?page=with:block-5ed5e52e8f08f5e373012cfb#block-5ed5e52e8f08f5e373012cfb\">Associated Press&nbsp;is carrying a report</a> that says Chinese officials sat on releasing the genetic map, or genome, of the coronavirus for over a week after multiple government labs had fully decoded it, not sharing details key to designing tests, drugs and vaccines. AP reports that health officials only released the genome after a Chinese lab published it on a virology website on 11 January. Even then, China stalled for at least two weeks more on giving the World Health Organization the details it needed, according to recordings of multiple internal meetings held by the UN health agency in January.</p> <h2><strong>Unemployment rise slows in Spain as lockdown lifts</strong></h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/02/coronavirus-live-news-dr-fauci-says-he-hasnt-spoken-to-trump-in-two-weeks-as-pakistanis-told-to-live-with-virus?page=with:block-5ed6250c8f084df971c8e17e#block-5ed6250c8f084df971c8e17e\">number of new jobseekers in&nbsp;Spain</a>&nbsp;was close to 27,000 in May, about 10 times lower than in March and April during the coronavirus lockdown, the labour ministry said. Spain imposed a nationwide lockdown on 14 March to slow the spread of the virus, and that month it counted more than 302,000 new jobseekers, followed by another 280,000 in April. But in May, as the lockdown was gradually eased, the government counted a total of 26,573 new jobseekers in the eurozone\u2019s fourth-largest economy, where the total number of unemployed stands at 3.8 million.&nbsp;The International Monetary Fund estimates unemployment in Spain could rise to 20.8% in 2020, while the government expects a figure of 19%.</p> <h2><strong>UK statistics watchdog criticises government\u2019s testing data</strong></h2> <p>Britain\u2019s statistics watchdog has again warned the health secretary, Matt Hancock, that figures on coronavirus tests remain \u201cfar from complete and comprehensible\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/02/coronavirus-live-news-dr-fauci-says-he-hasnt-spoken-to-trump-in-two-weeks-as-pakistanis-told-to-live-with-virus?page=with:block-5ed61f598f087122eca53e97#block-5ed61f598f087122eca53e97\">In a strongly-worded letter</a>, Sir David Norgrove, chairman of the UK Statistics Authority, said the way the government presented the figures appeared to be aimed at showing \u201cthe largest possible number of tests, even at the expense of understanding\u201d.</p> <h2>First Rohingya refugee in Bangladesh dies of Covid-19</h2> <p>A 71-year-old man has become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/02/coronavirus-live-news-dr-fauci-says-he-hasnt-spoken-to-trump-in-two-weeks-as-pakistanis-told-to-live-with-virus?page=with:block-5ed601768f084df971c8e031#block-5ed601768f084df971c8e031\">the first of the Rohingya refugees</a> living in vast camps in&nbsp;Bangladesh&nbsp;to die from coronavirus, an official said. Health experts have long warned that the deadly virus could race through the vast network of settlements housing almost a million refugees in the country\u2019s south-east. The fatality was in Kutupalong, the largest of the camps, which is home to roughly 600,000 people. The man was among at least 29 Rohingya to have tested positive for the virus in the camps. The official said the victim died in an isolation centre run by the medical charity Doctors Without Borders and was buried in the camp the same day.</p> <h2>Indonesia cancels hajj pilgrimage</h2> <p>Indonesia&nbsp;has cancelled the hajj pilgrimage this year for people in the world\u2019s largest Muslim-majority nation because of concerns over the coronavirus, the religious affairs minister said on Tuesday. Each year, hundreds of thousands of Indonesians go on the hajj to Saudi Arabia, with places allocated according to a quota system. The quota for this year was 221,000, with more than 90% of places already allocated. The average wait for a place on the pilgrimage is 20 years.</p> <h2><strong>People in Pakistan told to \u2018live with the virus\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan,&nbsp;has defended his decision to lift almost all lockdown measures because of economic losses, despite rising numbers of cases. In a televised address, Khan said his government could not afford to continue giving cash handouts to the poor on such a large scale. He urged people to act responsibly but said more infections and deaths were inevitable. \u201cThis virus will spread more. I have to say it with regret that there will be more deaths,\u201d Khan warned. \u201cIf people do take care they can live with the virus.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>New Zealand brings forward decision on easing restrictions</strong></h2> <p>The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has said&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/ardern-says-new-zealand-on-track-to-eliminate-coronavirus-ahead-of-schedule\">restrictions may be eased again sooner than planned&nbsp;</a>as the country was \u201cahead of schedule\u201d in tackling Covid-19. Cabinet will decide next Monday whether to move to level-1 restrictions \u2013 the most lenient \u2013 two weeks ahead of when the government had planned to make that decision.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/newzealand\">New Zealand</a>&nbsp;has had no Covid-19 cases for 11 consecutive days. Level-1 is thought to only involve border restrictions.</p> <h2><strong>Central and </strong><strong>South America \u2018intense zones for transmission\u2019</strong></h2> <p>The WHO sounded the warning as it said the epidemic in the regions had not reached its peak. On Monday deaths in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/mexico\">Mexico</a>&nbsp;passed 10,000, while Brazil registered 11,598 additional cases of coronavirus&nbsp;and 623 new deaths.

  "<p>When Mexican news anchor Carmen Aristegui was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/20/mexican-journalist-carmen-aristegui-mvs-radio-president-enrique-pena-nieto\">fired from a popular radio show </a>after revealing a presidential scandal on air, it sparked an outpouring of anger and protests.</p> <p>For millions of listeners Aristegui is a trusted voice cutting through government spin and corruption, and her absence left a void.</p> <p>Now a <a href=\"https://ff.hrw.org/film/radio-silence?city=London\">new documentary</a> charts the journey she made to overcome censorship and form a <a href=\"https://aristeguinoticias.com/\">new independent news platform</a> with a group of colleagues.</p> <p>In Radio Silence, filmmaker Juliana Fanjul follows Aristegui over the 22 months it took her to get back on air while continuing her investigative work amid a slew of lawsuits, death threats and the murder of another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/16/crusading-mexican-journalist-javier-valdez-shot-dead-in-sinaloa\">prominent journalist</a>.</p> <p>Aristegui\u2019s sacking in 2015 occurred against a backdrop of violence gripping Mexico and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/20/mexico-43-killed-students-\">disappearance of 43 students from the state of Guerrero</a>, explains Fanjul.</p> <p>\u201cWe were really concerned as a society to try and understand what was going on and her voice was very important. She was the first one to bring the families of those students on to the air and give them a voice.\u201d</p> <p>Aristegui was fired by her employer, the privately owned MVS Radio, over her demands that the company reinstate two colleagues who had been independently reporting on a scandal involving the then president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/enrique-pena-nieto\">Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto</a>, and his wife, and an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/10/mexico-president-enrique-pena-nieto-mansion-explain\">opulent villa to be built by a Mexican consortium</a> in exchange for a railway contract.</p> <p>The project involved Chinese capital and, in the face of what was called the Casa Blanca or White House scandal, Pe\u00f1a Nieto was forced to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/18/mexico-president-apologizes-luxury-home-contractor\">cancel the contract and apologise to the Chinese government</a>. When Aristegui was sacked, thousands of people gathered outside the radio station to protest.</p> <p>Fanjul used to listen to Aristegui\u2019s programme to keep abreast of developments in her native Mexico from her home in Switzerland. \u201cWhen the mic was cut I was filled with rage,\u201d she says. \u201cJournalists were being killed and I thought if they are doing this to Carmen who is so well-known, things are really bad.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought instead of being anguished I should make a film and I went to Mexico to find her.\u201d</p> <p>Fanjul spent four years filming Aristegui, providing a rare insight into the woman whose name has become synonymous with press freedom in Mexico.</p> <p>Her news programme had been a ratings hit. Yet no radio station offered her a job following her dismissal, such was the extent of government censorship. Instead, she set up on her own, and with the help of social media, continued to expose corruption.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8fba32fb56d0f1a77ed5c48457fce3a000b74db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8fba32fb56d0f1a77ed5c48457fce3a000b74db/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carmen Aristegui is shown in a still from Radio Silence, which is airing at the Human Rights Film Festival.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carmen Aristegui is shown in a still from Radio Silence, which is airing at the Human Rights Film Festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philippe Coeytaux/Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her investigations continued to make headlines around the world including her report headlined \u201cFrom Plagiarist to President\u201d, which alleged that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/mexico-president-enrique-pena-nieto-plagiarized-thesis-law-degree\">Pe\u00f1a Nieto had plagiarised almost a third of his law degree thesis</a>. Only one Mexican newspaper ran the story.</p> <p>It led to an increasingly hostile climate for Aristegui and her colleagues. One explains: \u201cWorking with Carmen Aristegui entails being constantly under surveillance \u2026 under fire \u2026 by journalists who are pro-government or close to power.\u201d Another reveals: \u201cI imagined they were going to make me disappear.\u201d</p> <p>Through behind-the-scenes footage at her office, Aristegui is portrayed as a passionate workaholic, fiercely determined, but with a warmth and generosity towards her colleagues. She has an impressive 8.6 million Twitter followers but Fanjul says her private life is strictly guarded.</p> <p>\u201cBecause of who she is, it is hard for her to trust people,\u201d explains Fanjul. \u201cIt took a long time for her to let me in.\u201d</p> <p>When the filmmaker got rare access to her home, Aristegui described how her teenage son had become a target of government surveillance.</p> <p>\u201cThe repression and scheming that took place to kick us off air, and later the constant legal attacks, led me to believe that it was much better for Emilio to leave Mexico, in a context in which his mum was publicly exposed to a scandal, where you never really know how it\u2019s going to end.\u201d</p> <p>She says they were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/19/mexico-cellphone-software-spying-journalists-activists\">targeted by Pegasus spyware</a>. \u201cWhoever was behind the Pegasus attacks on a young teen\u2019s iPhone, who was studying in the United States, displays a great degree of perversity,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause it was clearly his mum they wanted to hurt.\u201d</p> <p>After a break-in at her office, chilling CCTV footage shows men opening drawers and stealing a computer. It contained sensitive information about a powerful politician that Aristegui had previously implicated in a prostitution ring.</p> <p>\u201cAfter the office was broken into, more than one journalist resigned. Paradoxically, each obstacle that appeared in Carmen\u2019s way only strengthened her determination,\u201d says Fanjul.</p> <p>By 16 January 2017, Aristegui was back on air \u2013 on the internet from a sound-proofed booth in her small office.</p> <p>The 2018 election saw the formation of a new government, and Aristegui received an offer from media company Grupo Radio Centro.</p> <p>\u201cIt confirms the pressure was coming from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/mexico-president-enrique-pena-nieto-plagiarized-thesis-law-degree\">Pe\u00f1a </a>administration to keep her off air,\u201d says Fanjul.</p> <p>Her newscast is now broadcast across several radio stations but she retains editorial autonomy. Her investigations continue to make waves, including allegations of corruption in the government\u2019s national news agency.</p> <p>\u201cWe wished things would change with the new government but now it is attacking her and there are smear campaigns,\u201d Fanjul tells the Guardian. \u201cOnce more she has become the enemy.\u201d</p> <p><em>Radio Silence is streaming as part of the digital edition of the <a href=\"https://ff.hrw.org/london-digital-edition\">Human Rights Watch Film Festival</a>, and is <a href=\"https://ff.hrw.org/film/radio-silence?city=London%20Digital%20Edition\">available to watch</a> in the UK and Ireland until 5 June.</em></p>",

The call was about an invitation to attend the G7, but the PM later contacted the <strong>Australian embassy in Washington </strong>to ask how the country should lodge concern about a <strong>Channel 7 </strong>reporter and a cameraman who were attacked by police during protests in the US capital. </li> \n   <li> The<strong> NSW government </strong>will further ease lockdown restrictions to allow gyms to reopen from<strong> 13 June</strong>. Fitness centres, dance studios, indoor swimming and barre will also be allowed.</li> \n   <li>Hundreds of people have marched through Sydney in a <strong>Black Lives Matter</strong> protest against Indigenous deaths in custody in Australia and against the killing of George Floyd in the US.

Senate select committee on Covid-19 to quiz department secretary <strong>Kathryn Campbel</strong>l over the handling of the announcement, which the opposition argues was timed late on Friday to avoid

the media at 3.45pm on Friday to announce the refunds would be received by 373,000 people, cost a total $721m and include recovery fee charges.</p> \n  <p>Watt asked Campbell whether in her current or former role she had advised ministers of concerns about the legality of the robodebt scheme prior to this calendar year. </p> \n  <p>She said that question went to the legal advice around which the currently outstanding case revolves and it would be inappropriate to discuss while before the courts.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\"

In April, total hours worked declined by an unprecedented 9% and more than 600,000 people lost their jobs, with many more people working zero hours. Household spending weakened very considerably and investment plans are being deferred or cancelled.</p> \n   <p>Notwithstanding these developments, it is possible that the depth of the downturn will be less than earlier expected. The rate of new infections has declined significantly and some restrictions have been eased earlier than was previously thought likely. And there are signs that hours worked stabilised in early May, after the earlier very sharp decline. There has also been a pick-up in some forms of consumer spending.</p> \n   <p>However, the outlook, including the nature and speed of the expected recovery, remains highly uncertain and the pandemic is likely to have long-lasting effects on the economy. In the period immediately ahead, much will depend on the confidence that people and businesses have about the health situation and their own finances.</p> \n   <p>The substantial, coordinated and unprecedented easing of fiscal and monetary policy in Australia is helping the economy through this difficult period.

Cutting the number of seats in a restaurant is devastating, and this is why restaurants are pivoting almost instantaneously to see if they can go to a delivery model and pick-up model to create another revenue stream.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Max Hardy:</strong> I\u2019m just always about what\u2019s beneficial for your bottom line. Mannequins don\u2019t really help the bottom line.&nbsp;[Instead] we\u2019ll rely heavily on reservations, so every two hours I\u2019m hitting that minimum capacity, that capacity to make it beneficial, and I know that I won\u2019t be over-prepping.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>What will the restaurant experience be like as restrictions are eased?</strong></p> <p><strong>Kristel Arabian:</strong>&nbsp;What I\u2019ve been hearing is patrons will wear masks until they need to take them off to eat. Some of the more thoughtful operators are thinking of providing paper envelopes to keep them safe, because they don\u2019t want the mask touching the table. We will no longer be handing things to people, we will be putting things down on the table. The host is not going to be a host any more. There\u2019s going to be more of a \u201csafety captain\u201d position instead, someone who greets you at the door. There aren\u2019t going to be any walk-ins. You can\u2019t just show up. Some restaurants are even talking about locking the doors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Could outdoor dining spaces be beneficial, especially with growing evidence that it is safer to not be in enclosed spaces?</strong>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Arabian: </strong>We\u2019re hearing that natural airflow really helps. Everyone is wanting to limit their time indoors in public places. Los Angeles is working on expanding outdoor eating on sidewalks. Other cities,&nbsp;like Washington DC, have shut down really popular streets, they\u2019ve turned them into a promenade, so that people can have distanced eating.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>What are some of the changes in procedures being implemented for restaurant staff?</strong>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Rose: </strong>Masks, mandatory hand-washing. We\u2019re seeing that in certain establishments&nbsp;every employee has their temperature taken and basically needs a daily health waiver thing, that basically states \u201cI have not traveled to any coronavirus hotspots in the last 14 days, I haven\u2019t been sick, nobody in my family is sick.\u201d You will also see the restaurant and food business start to talk about marketing their safety programs just as much as they market where their chicken comes from. There will also be new positions created, like the \u201chead of sanitation\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Hardy: </strong>Before I open I want to get all my staff tested to make sure they\u2019re good. We\u2019ve ordered sanitizer kits for every customer that comes in. I\u2019m turning my [point of sale] system to a handheld system, the customer gets handed the handheld system, they can do their own thing, versus the cashier touching it. We\u2019ve got masks, we\u2019re changing our aprons every 15 to 20 minutes, changing our gloves with every order.</p> <p><strong>Are you concerned that diners won\u2019t be ready to dine out even if restaurants are ready to open?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rose: </strong>You\u2019re going to see a lot of people that will want to gently tiptoe back into it, and you\u2019re going to see people who are dying to get out there and sit down at a bar. They\u2019re going to need to wear masks in the restaurants, take it off when their food and drink shows up, and then put the masks back on.&nbsp;If<strong> </strong>it<strong> </strong>allows us to slowly reintroduce one of the most enjoyable things in our lives, and that is dining at a restaurant, a little discomfort isn\u2019t too much to ask for.</p> <p>I hope society sees this and steps up and understands the pressure. When we do reopen at limited capacity with lots of new rules in place, people need to understand why they need to follow the rules. I hope that people do.&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Max Hardy is a chef based in Detroit and founder of </em><em>the River Bistro and Coop</em><em> Detroit, a fast casual Caribbean fusion restaurant.

  "<p>It is a strange feeling to be sick in a pandemic. I don\u2019t just mean for the ones who fall ill from the virus. I mean the rest of us. Those who were ill long before \u201ccoronavirus\u201d entered the vocabulary, who got sick and stir-crazy when it wasn\u2019t headline news. Suddenly, everyone is experiencing what those of us with chronic illness have long been familiar with: the urge to break out after being trapped inside for months \u2013 and the quiet nerves about doing it.</p> <p>Chronically ill people are the experts in this strange new world. We are well aware the human body is not an impenetrable beast, that immune systems are fragile, that nerve endings can sting,&nbsp;that lungs can struggle to gasp for air.&nbsp;We are also used to isolation: the mind-numbing boredom of the 26th Friday without going to the pub, and the unrivalled joy of the first overpriced gin afterwards.</p> <p>I have not left the house for nine months, and it is more than two years since I became largely housebound.&nbsp;I hate that word. \u201cHousebound\u201d. As if you were an inanimate object, tied to the back gate. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/28/uk-doctors-braced-for-winter-flu-outbreak\">The&nbsp;bad winter flu of 2017</a>&nbsp;combined with what I\u2019ll call some D-grade genetics and I developed a kind of post-viral fatigue.&nbsp;I\u2019d like to downplay it for laughs, but ventilators are hard to make jokes about.&nbsp;I couldn\u2019t breathe, could barely move; every muscle hurt.&nbsp;It would have been easier to have been hit by a truck, rather than just feel like it. At least I would have had a good story. But as the world is learning, viruses can be \u2013 what\u2019s the medical term? \u2013 total bastards. I became housebound. The word doesn\u2019t matter. The result is the same.&nbsp;</p> <p>As lockdown slowly eases, I have found myself thinking about what it is to leave the house after a long spell inside. The rest of the public will, in time, find themselves in a bizarre wonderland: visiting a friend\u2019s house again, getting on a train, sitting in a bar.&nbsp;These are the firsts that are not actually firsts, the new experiences you have had a thousand times before. It would be natural if you were feeling anxious. Isolation is hard going, but then so is escaping it.&nbsp;</p> <p>I\u2019ve been through that particular looking glass myself.&nbsp;When I fell ill, life in every normal way stopped. There was no going out. No inviting people in. Just bed, and my thoughts. Luckily I am fascinating, but there are limits to even my internal chat. Months pass, the pain and exhaustion hum, and&nbsp;life as you know it has fallen in on itself.&nbsp;Eventually, it is a&nbsp;Thursday night, though you have lost all knowledge of what day it is, and&nbsp;you find yourself working out how many tiny cracks there are on the walls. It is&nbsp;3am;&nbsp;you think of the last time you sat in a restaurant and wonder if you ever will again.&nbsp;</p> <p>I don\u2019t know if it was growing up with a disability, but I was always the sort of person to appreciate the everyday moments. I looked at the water as the Thames rippled in the evening light. I paused to laugh as a mate danced drunk in the road (do not try this). Stuck at home, I became grateful for that, as if each frame was safely banked and the memories could be replayed on a loop.&nbsp;</p> <p>When you are a child, they say television restricts your mind. But when you are ill, it opens it. Watching hours of&nbsp;the Tour de France inside four walls, I was out of bed and soaring over the sky-blue Alps. Dozing through the London marathon, I was back at work wading through the noise of the city. With Springwatch, I was in the park listening to the birds sing.&nbsp;</p> <p>Still, I ached for the world. I missed people: the arms of those I knew and crowds of those I didn\u2019t. I missed nights out: eating food someone else had cooked, the smell of cigarettes as we huddled next to a garden heater.&nbsp;I missed getting ready to go out as much as being out: putting on an uncomfortable bra and the way mascara smells when it sets.&nbsp;I even missed trains: the freedom of the tracks, the possibility of a departure board.&nbsp;</p> <p>A few months in, I&nbsp;began to collect photos. Photos of people I loved.&nbsp;The places I used to go; the carefree smiles and the towering buildings. Instagram squares printed and hung on a grid.&nbsp;It was my own&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/monica-lewinsky-among-thousands-to-share-last-normal-photo\">#lastnormalphoto</a>&nbsp;hashtag, except for my eyes only. When I had started to recover enough to go outside a little, I would take a photo of myself each time. At work. At the park. To prove to myself I had been there. I had done that. The trees were not a figment of my imagination. My lungs had breathed the air. I had been myself, at least for a while. I call this the narcissistic phase.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7d3aa016a7fa7c24f5b0a571c423f1b9c274dc32\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d3aa016a7fa7c24f5b0a571c423f1b9c274dc32/0_0_6165_5669/1000.jpg\" alt=\"illustration - final approved g2 for 200602 Frances Ryan lockdown\" width=\"1000\" height=\"920\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Fien Jorissen at Heartagency.com/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first time I saw outside again was to go to the hairdresser, which in retrospect seems apt for where we are now. It had been five months since I had fallen ill and my hair had carried on, even when I had stopped. It hadn\u2019t occurred to me to try a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/apr/17/show-us-cut-hair-haircut-lockdown-coronavirus\">lockdown-style home cut</a> and I resembled a pasty Rapunzel.&nbsp;</p> <p>When your body has denied you the chance to take the mundane excursions most people do every day, having that opportunity again feels electrifying.&nbsp;In the spring air, the blossom unfurled and lined the streets with pink.&nbsp;Chunks of blond hair dropped to the floor, the smell of perming solution in the air.&nbsp;Manoeuvring through the streets to go back home, I fixed on the surroundings. The paths lined with blooming trees, the strangers carrying the weekly shop.&nbsp;It felt like a scene from <a href=\"https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0104187/\">that&nbsp;</a><a href=\"https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0104187/\">90s&nbsp;Brendan Fraser film</a> where the time-travelling caveman&nbsp;sees cars for the first time. Wonder mixed with terror.&nbsp;</p> <p>There is a feeling, somewhere between walking through your front door and reaching Superdrug, when your brain wants to protect you from the outside world. You tell yourself you are going to die, possibly next to the tampons. You are not, of course, and you breathe slowly, reminding yourself that you used to do this all the time. That you are fine. That you are actually great.</p> <p>I remember the panic attack I had the third time I went outside again, but I remember the happiness, too. The 99 I slowly licked in the park and the towering Flake, like I was&nbsp;eight years old again, triumphant by the ice-cream van at the school gates. I remember the utter joy of holding people I loved for the first time in a year: the smell of familiar perfume and the feel of stubble on my cheek. I remember the other&nbsp;feeling wavering in my stomach: relief.&nbsp;I had found something that I had lost, if only for a little while.&nbsp;</p> <p>I won\u2019t pretend chronic illness is the same as lockdown. One occurs because sickness has already come, the other is an attempt to avoid it. One is usually permanent, the other is temporary \u2013 even if doesn\u2019t feel like it.&nbsp;But the lines between healthy and sick seem more blurred than they used to. Or, to put it another way, we are all a little housebound now.&nbsp;</p> <p>Established wisdom says not to take advice from someone in their pyjamas, but if I could offer any, it would be this.&nbsp;The thing that tends to keep you awake at night during these times is not what you miss, but the fear that you will never get it back.&nbsp;You almost certainly will. You will in time regain the precious things: hug your mum, sit in a theatre, gorge on a McDonald\u2019s at the end of a night out.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People talk about a grand return to normal after lockdown but the truth is, \u201cnormal\u201d is hard to refind</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is such happiness in that \u2013 in rediscovering the people and places we love. But it is not ungrateful if you&nbsp;feel less than joy, if you feel some pressure or panic lurking at the thought of going back outside. It is kind to give yourself time to readjust. To go just half a&nbsp;mile from home at first. To start small.&nbsp;Savour the little details; ground yourself in the sights and sounds. The unfurling of the lilac. Your best friend\u2019s laugh.&nbsp;</p> <p>If you still find yourself struggling, that\u2019s OK too. Don\u2019t pathologise normal human responses. If you have not seen your sister in months, it is perfectly natural to be sad. If you haven\u2019t been in a crowd since March, it is easy to be anxious \u2013<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/31/sheilding-people-voice-fears-over-lockdown-easing-in-england\"> even more so if you\u2019re shielding</a> and are now going out for the very first time.&nbsp;Similarly, if you find those feelings dominating your mind and restricting your ability to get on, professional help is there. It is well known that mental health support is not always available on the NHS, but GPs are still the best start. Many therapists are now online, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-online-therapy-service-to-offer-free-sessions-across-uk-self-isolating\">some are even free</a>.</p> <p>People talk about a grand return to normal after lockdown but the truth is, \u201cnormal\u201d is hard to refind. Nothing is waiting for you exactly as you left it; events inevitably alter our viewpoint, each of us rarely leaves a rough period unmarked. And that is OK.&nbsp;Things change. Nothing is guaranteed. You adapt, perhaps even finding something better than before.&nbsp;We are taught to always be moving. That a night in front of Netflix is wasted. That Fomo is the modern way.</p> <p>If being unable to leave home does anything, it helps you re-evaluate those particular untruths. \u201cHome\u201d&nbsp;is just a different way of living, no less because it is smaller. It is a thing to be valued, to perhaps see more kindly than before. But if \u2013 when \u2013 you do get back out in the world, it will be all the more beautiful from your time away. Lick an ice-cream on a bench, as the summer sun warms your skin.&nbsp;Memories go round on a loop, inviting us out once again.</p>",
  "<p>Last week, President Donald Trump announced measures that could rewrite Hong Kong\u2019s relationship with the US. The territory now appears to be on the cusp of having its status in the world change more fundamentally than it did with the handover from Britain in 1997.</p> <p>Two weeks ago, Beijing announced it would legislate a new national security law and impose it on Hong Kong by decree, bypassing the city\u2019s duly elected legislature in flagrant disregard of the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement under which Hong Kong has been governed.</p> <p>In response, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, reported to Congress under the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act that Hong Kong no longer warranted treatment different from the rest of China, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/hong-kong-china-autonomous-us-pompeo-security-law\">stating</a>: \u201cNo reasonable person can assert today that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy from China.\u201d</p> <p>Finally, last Friday, as a consequence of Pompeo\u2019s certification, Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/trump-who-china-white-house-us\">announced</a> that he would be directing his administration \u201cto begin the process of eliminating policy exemptions that give Hong Kong different and special treatment\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/30/hong-kong-officials-lash-out-at-trump-plan-to-strip-city-of-special-status\">Hong Kong officials lash out at Trump plan to strip city of special status</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As dramatic as the announcement was, Trump did not set out any specific measures: nothing has yet changed in the US-Hong Kong relationship. As such, there is still room for compromise, from both Beijing and Washington. However, the current environment does not suggest that compromise is in the air, and Trump\u2019s statement laid the groundwork and foreshadowed the White House\u2019s probable next steps.</p> <p>Many observers have wondered if the US might not end up hurting the very people they were supposedly trying to help: the people of Hong Kong.</p> <p>Some of the potential US measures will not affect ordinary Hong Kong people or businesses. Certain bilateral agreements \u2013 such as those on extradition and mutual legal assistance \u2013 between Hong Kong and the US are likely to be the first casualties. This would end formal cooperation between Hong Kong and US authorities in criminal investigation and law enforcement, as well as remove the mechanism enabling the extradition of fugitives between the US and Hong Kong. Bringing Hong Kong within the scope of existing restrictions on exports of dual-use technologies is also a logical step, given Hong Kong\u2019s proximity, geographically and politically, to China. Hong Kong has allegedly been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/07/meng-wanzhou-huawei-cfo-court-bail-fraud-sanctions-breach-canada\">used to evade US sanctions</a> in the past.</p> <p>Sanctions are also on the cards for those Hong Kong and Beijing officials \u201cdirectly or indirectly involved in eroding Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy\u201d. This may include travel bans, or even extend to Treasury department sanctions over financial transactions and assets, and would cause pain for chief executive Carrie Lam and her ministers, but this would not affect ordinary Hong Kongers.</p> <p>However, the real challenge comes with Trump\u2019s threat to revoke Hong Kong\u2019s status as a separate customs and travel territory. This would mean the same tariffs, customs controls, quarantine and inspection standards, and visa rules would apply to Hong Kong as the rest of China, and would have serious adverse consequences for Hong Kong people and businesses. Many in Hong Kong are hoping that the US does not go that far. Pro-democracy media mogul Jimmy Lai <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/opinion/hong-kong-china-national-security-law.html\">argued in the New York Times</a> that \u201cremoving those privileges would only make Hong Kong more dependent on China\u201d.</p> <p>Perhaps the most profound impact of the US action may be that Hong Kong, in the very near term, would become globally regarded to be part-and-parcel of China, and to carry with it China\u2019s reputation, for better or worse. In the past, Hong Kong has enjoyed its own, separate, global reputation. Hong Kong government leaders and trade delegations travelled the world meeting with foreign governments and advocating for Hong Kong in international business circles under the aegis of the \u201ctwo systems\u201d side of \u201cone country, two systems\u201d. No matter what was happening in the rest of China, Hong Kong stood apart.</p> <p>Well, Hong Kong will stand apart no longer.</p> <p>It may be natural to blame the US for this, and some have already argued that the US measures are pushing Hong Kong closer to Beijing. Indeed, the changes in US policy towards Hong Kong are being driven by the bigger issue of a hardening US approach towards China, one of the&nbsp;few truly&nbsp;bipartisan issues remaining in US politics. In this sense, Hong Kong finds itself in the unfortunate position of&nbsp;being a pawn in an emerging cold war between the two superpowers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/30/beijing-hong-kong-beijing-china-uk-response\">Beijing has undermined the image of a stable Hong Kong | Isabel Hilton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, the sad reality is that Hong Kong government leaders have already been doing this themselves, all too willingly stepping into their role as proxies for Beijing, rather than standing up for the people of the city they are supposed to represent. This could not have been more evident than in the last week as Lam and many of her principal officials lined up to praise the new national security law, reciting from near-identical scripts that could have been drafted by the party central propaganda department.</p> <p>This is only the most recent example in a long-developing trend in which Hong Kong\u2019s leaders have gradually ceded its autonomy to Beijing. So, should there be any surprise when the Hong Kong they lead is finally treated accordingly?</p> <p>The reality is that Hong Kong\u2019s leaders have sacrificed the city\u2019s political neutrality: that special place Hong Kong held as a part of, yet at the same time apart from, the rest of China. The US measures are just the first international recognition of this process, and although they will also hasten its completion, it is hard not to conclude the process would have occurred in any event.</p> <p>The only hope for Hong Kong is that, with the advent of more enlightened leadership in Hong Kong or Beijing in the future, it might at some point be undone.</p> <p>\u2022 Antony Dapiran is the author of City on Fire: The Fight for Hong Kong</p> <p><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em></p>",

  "<p>In Adania Shibli\u2019s third novel, a young Arab woman is raped and murdered by Israeli troops in 1949. The difficulty of portraying the atrocity lies at the heart of a highly sophisticated narrative that pitilessly explores the limits of empathy and the desire to right (or write) historical wrongs by giving voice to the voiceless.<br><br>Shibli, a Palestinian writer based in Berlin, starts with an account of an Israeli platoon setting up camp at the desert border with Egypt. Long, uneventful days are broken when a patrol unit stumbles upon a group of nomads and instantly shoots them dead. \u201cThe soldiers moved through the spot of green surrounded by endless, barren sand dunes, combing the area for weapons... They found no weapons.\u201d<br><br>While the impassivity of the language generates a measure of dark humour, it\u2019s mainly a source of between-the-lines horror. Focusing on action, with no room for thoughts or feelings, or even names, the novel\u2019s third-person narration sticks to the viewpoint of the officer in charge, with barely any speech, and none that isn\u2019t his. The language, as light on judgment as a stage direction, is highly disconcerting.&nbsp;In Elisabeth Jaquette\u2019s translation from the original Arabic, events are recorded minutely but without emotion, not least when the officer seizes the only survivor, a young woman, and takes her back to the camp: \u201cHe brought his left hand back and held her by the throat, closed his right hand into a fist, and flung it at her face. After that the girl did not move... Then he lifted her shirt above the chest and lay his body on top of hers.\u201d<br><br>Halfway through, the novel loosens up to give us the first-person testimony of a nervy insomniac (also unnamed) in present-day Ramallah. Haunted by a newspaper report on the crimes we\u2019ve just read about, she\u2019s unable to shake off the idea of somehow telling the story from the victim\u2019s point of view \u2013 a project that leads her to embark on a risky road trip south, through long-razed villages, towards a site well beyond the zone permitted by her ID card.<br><br>While this more conversational segment generates suspense about the novel\u2019s wider purpose, interest also lies in its portrait of everyday life under occupation: what it\u2019s like, say, when soldiers blow up the building next to your office to get at targets hiding inside, and you find yourself bothered most of all by the dust blowing on to your desk.<br><br>Ultimately, the attempt to restore agency to someone we\u2019ve seen previously described as a \u201cstill-moaning black mass\u201d, heard only screaming in a language unknown to her persecutors, proves a dead end. The road trip meanders from detour to false trail before juddering to a shockingly abrupt halt; with a key role played by a pack of chewing gum, the title takes on the air of a cruel joke, in a climax that only underlines further how swiftly and cheaply life can be taken in the name of self-defence.<br><br>From one point of view, you might see the narrator\u2019s fate as a lesson in how trying to tell stories of suffering boils down to privilege she doesn\u2019t have. But the novel casts doubt on the enterprise in any case, which even seems quixotic or, at times, plain whimsical. In the end, the only view we have of the story comes from the perspective of the perpetrator, chillingly unmoved, depending on whether or not you\u2019re prepared to get symbolic about the poker-faced descriptions of his ablutions that occupy much of the novel\u2019s first half.<br><br>At one point, the narrator tries to talk herself out of her search, thinking there\u2019s \u201cno point in me feeling responsible for [the victim], like she\u2019s a nobody, and will forever remain a nobody whose voice nobody will hear\u201d.

  "<p>Concerns about Asian Australians\u2019 \u201ctakeover\u201d of selective schools, and the use of private tutoring, loom large in the Australian media and debates about parenting and schooling.</p> <p>Tutoring is often framed as tantamount to cheating, or \u201cgaming the system\u201d, while critics argue that children\u2019s wellbeing is harmed by punishing study regimes. While some praise migrant families for their commitment to education, others argue that migrant parents are \u201cpushing too hard\u201d, raising the competitive stakes for everyone. Growing competition for places in high performing schools and classes fosters and feeds racism against Asian migrants in particular, who are seen by some as too successful.</p> <p>What is often missing in these debates is an understanding of what drives Asian migrants\u2019 approaches to education. Researching my new book, Aspiration and Anxiety: Asian Migrants and Australian Schooling, I gained an insight into their anxieties about being newcomers in an unequal society, and one with an increasingly segregated and competitive education system.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/24/if-australias-resources-were-taxed-the-way-norways-are-we-could-secure-the-future-of-our-schools\">If Australia's resources were taxed the way Norway's are, we could fully fund our schools | Emma Dawson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The stereotype around Asians and education is, of course, highly simplistic. Asian Australians are a diverse group with a long history in this country. And there are plenty of students from Asian backgrounds in disadvantaged schools and many struggle to keep up. But among children of more recently arrived skilled migrants, particularly those from east and south Asia, many are remarkably successful in school. They are overrepresented in selective schools and classes, and are conspicuous in prestigious university courses.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/31/how-much-would-it-cost-to-make-free-childcare-permanent-and-would-it-be-a-good-idea\">How much would it cost to make free childcare permanent, and would it be a good idea?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Based on interviews with Asian Australian students and parents in selective schools and classes in Sydney, my research shows how the combination of aspiration and anxiety lead to the intense focus on academic success that is sometimes labelled \u201ctiger parenting\u201d.</p> <p>Asian migrants\u2019 aspirations focus on their children\u2019s education because in Australia and elsewhere, Asian migrants are typically highly educated themselves, and their qualifications have enabled them to migrate. This is a product of Australia\u2019s selective migration policy that prioritises skilled migration.</p> <p>Many Asian migrants worked hard to succeed in the infamously competitive education systems of their home countries and understand schooling as a crucial stepping stone to career success. Naturally, they want their children to enjoy the same opportunities that education afforded them. \u201cWe just want our children to understand the importance of education,\u201d as one parent told me.</p> <p>However, migrants\u2019 aspirations coincide with deep anxiety about their children\u2019s future in a society where they are members of ethnic minorities. First generation Asian migrants often confront barriers to their own advancement, symbolised in the notion of the \u201cbamboo ceiling\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve been locked out of the system because we\u2019re minorities,\u201d said one of my interviewees.</p> <p>Fearful of racial discrimination, and lacking the local knowledge and networks of locals, many Asian migrants push their children to work hard as an insurance policy in a white-dominated society. As one mother expressed it, Asian migrants don\u2019t have the \u201cluxury\u201d to just \u201clet their kids play after school\u201d.</p> <p>In many ways, these parents are well-equipped to navigate the Australian education system. As Australian schooling has become more competitive and hierarchical, many Asian migrants\u2019 experience with their own cut-throat education systems becomes an asset here. They are used to thinking about education as \u201clike warfare\u201d, as one parent from Hong Kong said. In cities like Hong Kong, toddlers attend tutoring to get into the best kindergartens.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/19/home-schooling-everyones-finding-their-feet-and-we-need-to-be-gentle-with-each-other\">Home schooling: 'Everyone's finding their feet and we need to be gentle with each other'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Strategic decisions about school choice and residential choice, creating optimal home learning environments, cultivating the \u201cright\u201d peer group, and private tutoring \u2013 all of these strategies, familiar from migrants\u2019 own schooling days, bear fruit in Australia.</p> <p>After all, Australian families from a range of backgrounds are increasingly taking a more strategic approach to the education system, which has become more competitive and hierarchical in recent decades. While in the 1970s, selective schools were seen as elitist and outdated, since the 1980s, their number has surged. NSW now has almost 50 fully and partially selective schools. Meanwhile the number of private schools has also grown, along with federal funding for these schools. These changes have created an expanded culture of competition and anxiety in our education system.&nbsp;</p> <p>The current cohort of Asian migrants may well be a living embodiment of Australian neoliberal policy. As migrants, they have been hand-picked by Australian governments selecting newcomers based on their human capital credentials. As parents, educated in some of the toughest schooling systems in the world, they are uniquely placed to navigate an increasingly competitive education system in Australia.</p> <p>Taking into perspective the wider social context for \u201ctiger parenting\u201d may enable some of the heat to be taken out of current debates.</p> <p>Understanding the wider context also allows us to see some of the human consequences of neoliberal policy. Asian migrants were admitted into this country because of their skills and enterprise. As residents, they may unwittingly further Australian governments\u2019 neoliberal policies in education.</p> <p>But it is Australian governments that set policy directions. And if we are worried about growing hierarchies and inequalities in our education system, and escalating pressures on kids, it is we as a community that can demand change to those policies.</p> <ul> <li><p>Christina Ho is an associate professor of social and political sciences at the University of Technology Sydney, and the author of Aspiration and Anxiety: Asian Migrants and Australian Schooling.</p></li> </ul>",

The nightmare which has unfolded over the past 11 years has forced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/13/central-america-violence-refugee-crisis-gangs-murder\">hundreds of thousands of men, women and children to flee</a> a toxic mix of poverty, dire public services, corruption, gang- and state-sponsored violence.</p> <p>They risk <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/feb/21/mexico-kidnappings-refugees-central-america-immigration\">kidnap, extortion, rape and even death</a> at the hands of criminal gangs and corrupt state forces as they travel 1,500 or so miles overland through Mexico in hopes of reaching the United States.

The one thing the US does not seem willing to do is withdraw economic and political support from the post-coup ruling political party in Honduras.

At least&nbsp;25&nbsp;land and environmental defenders have been murdered in Honduras since&nbsp;2&nbsp;March 2016. Latin America remains the most dangerous region in the world to defend land and rivers from megaprojects like mines, dams, fracking, logging and biofuel cash crops, which are almost always licensed without proper consultation or compensation. Between March 2016 and November 2019, 340 defenders were killed in the Americas, according to Global Witness,&nbsp;a not-for-profit group.

  "<p> </p> <p>The final few months of Berta Ca\u0301ceres\u2019s life were filled with ominous signs. Just before Christmas 2015, she confided in her sister Agustina that her life was in danger. \u201cThe messages never stop, the harassment never stops, they have me under surveillance. They don\u2019t care that I have children. Those sons of bitches are going to kill me.\u201d</p> <p>Berta was involved in numerous land and water struggles alongside indigenous Lenca communities across western Honduras. But the battle to stop construction of a hydroelectric dam on the Gualcarque river, in the community of Ri\u0301o Blanco, had her more worried than usual. Berta told her children she was scared, and that they should take the threats seriously. \u201cMum said there was a group of dangerous <em>sicarios </em>[hitmen] attacking the Ri\u0301o Blanco community and asking about us, her daughters,\u201d said Laura, 23, the youngest, home from midwifery college for the Christmas break. \u201cI knew the threats were serious because she wouldn\u2019t leave me alone in the house, not even for a night.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/02/berta-caceres-was-exceptional-her-was-all-too-commonplace\">Berta C\u00e1ceres was exceptional. Her murder was all too commonplace</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Berta had reasons to suspect the hitmen were hired by Desa, the dam construction company. Desa\u2019s trumped-up criminal charges against her and other leaders of the Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (Copinh) had failed to silence them. Was it now it pursuing other means to stop the opposition?</p> <p>Her sense of unease intensified on 12 February 2016. Douglas Bustillo, a thuggish former army lieutenant and Desa\u2019s ex-security chief, messaged her Copinh deputy, Toma\u0301s Go\u0301mez, out of the blue, accusing Berta of cashing in on the Ri\u0301o Blanco struggle to win the prestigious Goldman environmental prize.</p> <p>Four days later, driving out of Ri\u0301o Blanco, Berta\u2019s car was shadowed by two SUVs carrying armed locals she knew were linked to Desa.</p> <p>On 20 February, Berta led a convoy to the Gualcarque, a river considered sacred by the Lenca people, to make a stand against the company\u2019s attempt to circumvent indigenous land rights by moving the dam across the shore. Desa was warned about the demonstration via its network of paid informants, and summoned its political and security allies to wreck the event. First, Copinh\u2019s buses and cars were detained at a checkpoint where everyone was forced out, registered and photographed by police and military officers. Then, a small crowd threw stones and insults. \u201cYou old witch, you\u2019ll never come back here!\u201d screamed the pro-dam deputy mayor at Berta.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5f7b2024115045043ebe379e2cea7581ef46683b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f7b2024115045043ebe379e2cea7581ef46683b/0_0_800_1208/662.jpg\" alt=\"Who Killed Berta C\u00e1ceres?

Waiting along the gruelling unshaded track were hired thugs and armed security guards and police officers, including some Tigres \u2013 an elite US-backed special weapons and tactics (Swat) team trained for urban combat.</p> <p>A drone buzzed overhead taking photographs as Copinh protesters threw rocks at the company machinery. Desa\u2019s security chief, former police major Jorge A\u0301vila, appeared with a grisly warning: \u201cIn a few days, you\u2019ll be eating someone\u2019s liver,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Still undeterred, Berta continued with the exhausted group to the river, where they sat on the shady bank to rest and connect with the Gualcarque\u2019s sacred spirit. When they finally left it was dark, and Berta\u2019s car was pelted with beer bottles and rocks, smashing the rear window.</p> <p>Less than a week later, around midday on 26 February, a double-cabin pickup truck with polarized windows drove up the narrow dead-end street leading to the Copinh head office in the city of La Esperanza. A tall man with a military-style haircut got out and asked for Berta, while the driver kept the engine running. When asked to identify himself, he jumped into the car and sped off.</p> <p>These incidents made Berta even more nervous, and she arranged to stay at Utopi\u0301a, Copinh\u2019s bustling training centre in La Esperanza, so as not to be at home alone when Laura returned to university in Buenos Aires.</p> <p>She also contacted her friend Brigitte Gynther, a researcher at the School of Americas Watch (SOAW), who catalogued threats against Copinh. \u201cI need to talk to you,\u201d she wrote in a text message on 29 February. \u201cI have news.\u201d Brigitte was working in Colombia, but they agreed to speak later.</p> <p>On the morning of 1 March, Berta drove Laura to Tonconti\u0301n airport on the outskirts of the capital, Tegucigalpa. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you,\u201d she said. \u201cEnjoy life, make the most of it, but remember this is where you belong, in Honduras, fighting to make this a better place.\u201d</p> <p>Just before Laura went through security Berta hugged her youngest child one more time. \u201cThis country is fucked, but if anything happens to me, don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d</p> <p>Laura assumed she was worried about being arrested again. \u201cMy mum was so well known that I really doubted anything serious would happen to her. I thought meeting the pope and winning the Goldman prize would protect her.\u201d</p> <p>At 2.08pm, Sergio Rodri\u0301guez sent a WhatsApp message to Desa shareholders and senior managers, among them company president David Castillo, a US-trained former military intelligence officer, confirming that Berta would be in La Esperanza the following day.</p> <p>Laura\u2019s plane took off just as Berta\u2019s old friend Gustavo Castro, a politically astute Mexican environmentalist, was landing at San Pedro Sula international airport on the other side of the country. Berta had invited Gustavo to give a workshop on alternative energy for Copinh members. The pair hadn\u2019t seen each other in several years and spent the evening catching up at Berta\u2019s new house in Colonia Li\u0301bano, a gated community on the southern edge of La Esperanza.</p> <p>Berta told him about the turmoil generated by the campaign to stop the dam, a construction project backed by members of one of the country\u2019s most powerful clans, the Atala Zablah family, as well as international banks. \u201cI had no idea how much pressure she was under,\u201d Gustavo would recall.</p> <p>They were both tired, so Berta suggested calling it a night and offered to take Gustavo to his lodgings, but he was worried about her safety. \u201cIt\u2019s so dark and isolated here, will you be alright driving back alone so late?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. But why don\u2019t you come and stay here with me from tomorrow night?\u201d</p> <p>The next day, Tuesday 2 March, Berta opened the workshop in Utopi\u0301a before heading to the outdoor kitchen area, carrying her three constantly chiming mobile phones and customary notebook and pen. She messaged Laura, telling her not to worry as Gustavo would be staying at the house. She also called her close colleague Sotero Chavarri\u0301a, who was in Tegucigalpa for medical treatment. \u201c<em>Hermano</em>, I need you back here, come soon, I have to tell you something, it\u2019s important,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Shortly after, Sotero received another call: security chief A\u0301vila and a dozen Ri\u0301o Blanco locals aligned with Desa were approaching La Esperanza in a Toyota pickup truck.</p> <p>What business did they have that day, were they coming to keep tabs on Berta? On his way back to La Esperanza, Sotero noticed the police checkpoint at the city entrance was unmanned. This was so unusual that he mentioned it to colleagues.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"86406eb1167f84b0515f3cc653bbab12418e3774\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86406eb1167f84b0515f3cc653bbab12418e3774/0_0_5591_3354/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman places flowers on an altar set up in honor of Berta C\u00e1ceres during a demonstration outside Honduras\u2019 embassy in Mexico City on 15 June 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman places flowers on an altar set up in honor of Berta C\u00e1ceres during a demonstration outside Honduras\u2019s embassy in Mexico City on 15 June 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eduardo Verdugo/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Later that morning, Lilian Esperanza, the Copinh finance coordinator, arrived at Utopi\u0301a with a handful of cheques and a donor letter that needed Berta\u2019s signature. \u201cWe need to change the signature,\u201d Berta said. \u201cWhat if something happens to me? I could be jailed or killed. If you have problems accessing money, then what would happen to Copinh? I keep on reporting the threats, but no one takes any notice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly. Nothing\u2019s going to happen to you,\u201d Lilian insisted.</p> <p>Why was Berta acting as if time was running out?</p> <p>It was late morning when she left the workshop with Gaspar Sa\u0301nchez, Copinh\u2019s young sexual diversity coordinator, heading for the central market where Berta was helping vendors oppose the mayor\u2019s plan to replace it with a shopping mall. Later, in the car on their way back to the workshop, Gaspar interviewed Berta for Copinh\u2019s community radio station. \u201cEnergy is not just a technical issue, it\u2019s a political issue to do with life, territories, sovereignty and the right to community self-determination. We believe this is the moment to profoundly debate capitalism and how energy is part of the domination of indigenous communities and violation of their rights \u2026 That\u2019s what Lenca communities like Ri\u0301o Blanco are living through right now.\u201d</p> <p>It would be her last interview.</p> <p>Berta then called her friend Ismael Moreno, a Jesuit priest known as Padre Melo. \u201cShe was scared, but it was Camilito she was most worried about,\u201d Melo said: Berta had recently received an anonymous message threatening to chop her only grandchild into pieces.</p> <p>Back at the workshop, Berta messaged SOAW\u2019s Brigitte Gynther at 4.44pm, asking when she\u2019d be back from Colombia. \u201cI never found out what she wanted to tell me,\u201d said Brigitte. \u201cBut she only contacted me when something was seriously wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Berta and Gustavo then left Utopi\u0301a, popping in to visit her mother before heading to her favourite downtown eatery, El Fogo\u0301n, for dinner and a beer. Just before 9.30pm, a black double-cabin Toyota Hilux with polarized windows and no number plates was seen by a neighbour outside her mother\u2019s house. Soon after, Berta and Gustavo arrived back at her place.</p> <p>Berta\u2019s green and gold bungalow stands amid a scattering of garishly painted houses enclosed by a mishmash of wire and white wooden fencing, with views of a lake and distant pine-forested hills. The bungalow is on a dirt road about 150 metres from the security gate, which is operated by two guards working in 12-hour shifts.</p> <p>The layout is unusual, with the front door leading into the open-plan lounge and a flimsy wooden back door leading into the kitchen. She and Gustavo sat on the front patio talking for half an hour or so, enjoying the breeze. Then he smoked a cigarette, while Berta finished working on a document.</p> <p>Gustavo retired to the guest bedroom nearest the lounge. Berta\u2019s room was at the other end of the narrow hallway. After changing into an olive-green T-shirt and black shorts, she sat on her bed and kept working. At 11.25 she sent a message to Juan Carlos Jua\u0301rez, a police liaison officer charged with overseeing her protection. \u201cWherever you are, I wish you well. Please be careful. <em>Besos </em>[kisses].\u201d</p> <p>At around 11.35, Gustavo heard a noise. Tap! Tap! Tap! He thought it was Berta cleaning or fetching something from the kitchen, and barely looked up from his laptop. A minute or less later there was a louder, duller sound. Thud! Gustavo assumed Berta had dropped something in the kitchen. Then he heard her call out: \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was then I realized that someone was in the house and something bad was going to happen,\u201d Gustavo recalled. Seconds later, a tall, dark-skinned youth with cropped hair, wearing a black top and white scarf, kicked open the bedroom door and aimed a gun at his head from about two metres away. He heard the fuzzy sound of a walkie-talkie. Seated on the bed, Gustavo was looking straight at the gunman, when he heard Berta\u2019s bedroom door being forced open. It sounded as if she was struggling to push someone away. Then he heard three shots. Bang! Bang! Bang! Berta\u2019s legs gave way and she fell backwards. She tried to defend herself and scratched at the gunman as he bent over her. But she was weak, and the killer stamped on her bleeding body until she could no longer resist.</p> <p>Gustavo jumped up off the bed and in a split second lifted his left hand to protect his face as the gunman fired a single shot. Bang! The bullet grazed the back of his left hand and the top of his left ear. Gustavo lay completely still on the floor as blood oozed from the wounds. The gunman was convinced and left, but still Gustavo dared not move. Moments later he heard Berta\u2019s voice. \u201cGustavo! Gustavo!\u201d</p> <p>He ran to her and saw his friend sprawled on her back between the bedroom door and the wooden closet, struggling to breathe. Her curly black hair was sticky with the blood from three bullet wounds, spreading across her shorts and T-shirt.</p> <p>Gustavo squeezed through the small gap between the door and her shivering body. He knelt down and wrapped his arms around her, trying to keep her warm and alive. \u201cDon\u2019t go, Berta! Don\u2019t die! Stay with me,\u201d he begged. But Berta Ca\u0301ceres was bleeding to death.</p> <p>\u201cGet my phone,\u201d she murmured. \u201cOn the table.\u201d At around a quarter to midnight Berta uttered her last words. \u201cCall Salvador! Call Salvador!\u201d</p> <p>Then she was gone.</p> <p>Berta Ca\u0301ceres had been murdered. Killed in her bedroom less than a year after winning the foremost prize for environmental defenders.</p> <p>Gustavo survived. But would his eyewitness evidence be enough to identify the gunmen? And who was behind this bold execution? Could there ever be justice for someone like Berta in a country like Honduras, where impunity reigns supreme?</p> <p>Would we ever know who killed Berta Ca\u0301ceres?</p> <ul> <li><p>&nbsp;This is an extract from Who Killed Berta C\u00e1ceres?

Nature has clearly benefited from several months of dramatically reduced economic activity. From a climate crisis perspective, this drop in emissions is astonishingly close to the 7.6% yearly reduction in emissions that scientists have advised will be necessary during the next decade. And yet none of this is cause for celebration.</p> <p>The resilience of nature is temporary, and will last only as long as the lockdown is enforced. More importantly, the reduction in greenhouse gases is not the result of decarbonising the economy, but the unintended consequence of economic paralysis that has come with painful human consequences and huge costs to lives and livelihoods. This is not what addressing the climate crisis looks like. The thoughtful reduction of greenhouse gases has to be intentional not circumstantial, sustained not temporary. Above all, it must lead to improved human wellbeing, not to human or economic suffering. </p> </blockquote> <p>More here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/01/covid-low-carbon-future-lockdown-pandemic-green-economy\">Covid-19 has given us the chance to build a low-carbon future | Christiana Figueres</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ed4be468f084df971c8d581\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T08:45:59.424Z\">9.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Other things reopening today include: cinemas in Thailand:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e80698f6ef448de86c3e44a47a701819819eebb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e80698f6ef448de86c3e44a47a701819819eebb/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Customers at a cinema in Bangkok, Thailand\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People wear face mask to help curb the spread of the coronavirus during a movie at the Paragon Cineplex cinema in Bangkok, Thailand.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sakchai Lalit/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ikea stores in Britain:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de2811bd75e3f3b290db39236d1a8a853f306d30\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de2811bd75e3f3b290db39236d1a8a853f306d30/0_250_4929_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Customers queue outside an Ikea store in Nottingham\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Customers queue outside an Ikea store in Nottingham before it reopens, after the British government relaxed lockdown measures.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73254ec01e55b0086c1700fef496e9d91e5f6b79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73254ec01e55b0086c1700fef496e9d91e5f6b79/0_233_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Customers queue at Ikea in Warrington\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Customers queue at Ikea in Warrington as it re-opens following the lifting of lockdown restrictions in the United Kingdom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And amusement parks in Japan:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a27cb0486663e99e289ebb74ad3ad12f791fa177\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a27cb0486663e99e289ebb74ad3ad12f791fa177/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A dolphin performs at Hakkeijima Sea Paradise near Tokyo, Japan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People wearing face masks enjoy a dolphin performance as the Hakkeijima Sea Paradise amusement park opens after a two-month closure due to the preventative measures to help curb the spread of the coronavirus in Yokohama near Tokyo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Koji Sasahara/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ed4bced8f08f5e3730122e2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T08:34:57.780Z\">9.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Trains are running today in Manila for the first time in two months, as the lockdown is eased in the <strong>Philippines</strong>.

Thank you for following along. My colleague Simon Burnton will be taking on the blog now to continue our round-the-clock coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. </p> <p>A reminder that we have a blog dedicated to the George Floyd protests <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/may/31/george-floyd-protests-latest-news-riots-us-cities-donald-trump-police-brutality-live\">here</a>. </p> <p>Below are the latest developments from the last few hours: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Manila eases lockdown. </strong>Traffic jams and crowds of commuters returned to the Philippine capital on Monday, as Manilla relaxed antivirus measures in a high-stakes gamble to slowly reopen the economy while fighting the coronavirus outbreak. Public transport was still limited and many commuters waited for hours to get a ride despite the government deploying special buses. School classes remain suspended for the next two weeks. Barber shops and beauty salons can open next week at a third of their capacity. The Philippines remains a south-east Asian hotspot for Covid-19, with more than 18,000 infections and 957 deaths.</li> <li><strong>Japan may open doors to travellers from selected countries. </strong>Japan is considering reopening its borders to travellers from selected countries that have low levels of coronavirus infections, as it begins to ease restrictions put in place earlier this year to control the outbreak. As schools, cinemas, sports clubs and department stores reopened in Tokyo on Monday, media have reported that the government is also planning to allow travellers in from Thailand, Vietnam, Australia and New Zealand in the coming months. There was no immediate comment from the foreign ministry.</li> <li><strong>Hong Kong reports first locally transmitted case in two weeks. </strong>Hong Kong has confirmed its first locally transmitted coronavirus cases in more than two weeks, fuelling concerns over its spread as restrictions on movement are relaxed, Reuters reports. The Centre for Health Protection said on Sunday it was investigating two confirmed cases of coronavirus, taking the number of cases so far to 1,085. Four people have died of the disease in Hong Kong.</li> <li><strong>Wuhan reports zero new asymptomatic cases. </strong>Wuhan, the Chinese city of around 11 million people where the Covid-19 pandemic began, reported no new asymptomatic cases on Sunday, according to Chinese health officials. State media, Xinhua, said on Monday more than 60,000 nucleic acid tests were conducted on Sunday, finding no asymptomatic cases. Mainland China reported 16 new cases overall on Sunday, the highest daily number in three weeks. All were reported as imported cases \u2013 11 in Sichuan province, three in Inner Mongolia, and two in Guangdong. </li> <li><strong>Brazil passes 500,000 Covid-19 cases. </strong>Brazil has reported 16,409 new cases, taking the total of infected cases to 514,849. It keeps the country in second place in terms of infections, behind the US on 1.78 million cases. Brazil has moved into fourth in terms of deaths, with 29,314 fatalities, according to the health ministry. President Jair Bolsonaro has repeatedly dismissed the severity of the virus and continued to flout social distancing measures. On Sunday, he rode a horse to a rally calling for the supreme court to be shut down for investigating him. </li> <li><strong>Moscow eases lockdown despite high virus caseload. </strong>Shopping malls and parks are set to reopen in Moscow on Monday as the Russian capital eases coronavirus restrictions despite having the world\u2019s third-largest caseload, with 405,843 infections. The relaxation of the confinement orders in Moscow, the centre of Russia\u2019s outbreak with a population of more than 12 million, comes after President Vladimir Putin announced the epidemic had passed its peak in the country. </li> <li><strong>North Korea to reopen schools. </strong>North Korea will reopen schools this month after shuttering them over the coronavirus pandemic, reports said on Monday. Pyongyang has not confirmed a single infection but has imposed strict rules, including closing its borders and putting thousands of its people into isolation.
