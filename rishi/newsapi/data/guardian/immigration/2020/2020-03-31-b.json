These travellers are being quarantined in hotels and motels, though there have been some reports of those quarantined being allowed out to buy their own groceries -- which is not allowed.</li> \n   <li>Far more testing. Skegg said loosening of rules around testing -- which no longer require patients to have traveled overseas or have come into contact with a confirmed case -- haven\u2019t got through to doctors in the field. </li> \n   <li>The capacity for rapid case contract tracing must be greatly expanded as a matter of urgency, Skegg said.</li> \n  </ol> \n  <p>The epidemic committee was held by video call, with a live stream broadcast publicly and available to watch on social media and many news outlets. As with any group of people holding a Zoom meeting, there was the occasional person speaking with bizarre echoing feedback, although only one lawmaker asking a question had to be reminded to un-mute his microphone.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e82a8d58f0866297e9f3f3e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/mario-koran\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-31T02:21:08.774Z\">3.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <h2>Anger as Las Vegas turns parking lot into sleeping area for homeless</h2> \n  <p>Images of homeless people sleeping in a converted parking lot in Las Vegas have sparked criticism, even as the city officials describe an \u201cemergency situation\u201d and say the solution was the best option after another shelter was forced to close amid the coronavirus crisis. <br><br>Over the weekend, authorities in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/las-vegas\">Las Vegas</a> needed to find additional sleeping space for the city\u2019s sizable homeless population when a 500-bed overnight shelter closed after a client tested positive for the new coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>Officials turned a parking lot into a makeshift shelter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ClarkCountyNV/status/1244029870461472768\">saying</a> spaces for sleeping were drawn 6ft apart in observance of federal social distancing guidelines.</p> \n  <p>Many white boxes were covered up with blue mats that could be more easily cleaned.

That meant a mentally-ill patient could end up in a care home without their or their guardian\u2019s consent, to free up hospital beds for other patients.</p> \n  <p>In a policy memorandum published alongside the bill, the Scottish government said it was justified because elderly patients were the most vulnerable to the coronavirus, while the crisis meant extra beds were desperately needed.</p> \n  <p>The government said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Hospitals are looking to increase dramatically the number of beds available to deal with the expected large influx of patients affected by coronavirus and requiring hospital treatment. Adults lacking capacity are often elderly patients with dementia who are at high risk from coronavirus and it is a high priority to move them to somewhere safer and more suitable for their care and treatment.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Dr Arun Chopra, the commission\u2019s medical director, said it was very concerned about the rights of those patients. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We understand the need for this emergency legislation to become available during these exceptional times, but we would want to see the reduction in safeguards to only be used if absolutely necessary, and for as short a time as is possible.</p> \n   <p>We believe it is vital that effective mechanisms are in place to scrutinise how and when these powers are used.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The commission said it would adapt its monitoring systems to cope with the emergency powers published in the new coronavirus (Scotland) bill, and the impact the pandemic had on services. But it said ministers needed to amend the bill to require councils to notify a statutory body every time these orders were used.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8379668f087564da1e33b9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/rebeccasmithers\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-31T17:10:57.507Z\">6.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Swedish furniture giant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ikea\">Ikea </a>has today reopened the doors of its <strong>Croydon</strong> store \u2013 but only for vulnerable customers and key workers who can shop for essentials at its Swedish food market.</p> \n  <p>The rest of the store will remain closed but the Swedish food market is opening to key workers at different times, including NHS workers and police, the elderly, most vulnerable and their carers and Ikea co-workers.</p> \n  <p>Its normal range has been bolstered with staple items including bread, milk, butter and canned tomatoes.

The communities secretary, <strong>Robert Jenrick</strong>, appeared on television news over the weekend helping deliver food boxes to houses with vulnerable people. </p> \n  <p>Rochdale council\u2019s Labour leader, Allen Brett, called on the government yesterday to improve the quality of its parcels: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Everyone appreciates that this is an unprecedented situation but the parcels that have been provided were not of the quality we were expecting. Thankfully our council officers are able to source food locally and add them to the packs to ensure that those receiving them have a better choice of items.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He told the Guardian that after he went public with his concerns he received a call late last night from the secretary of state\u2019s office accusing him of putting out false information. </p> \n  <p>A council spokesman said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We do not recognise the secretary of state\u2019s description of these packages being additional supplies to kick-start wider efforts as they were linked directly to our shielded residents. While we are pleased to hear reports that packages sent directly to homes were of a higher standard, we also note that other councils have expressed concerns about the quality of the initial packages they received from government.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Referring food items sent out in Rochdale, a government spokesperson said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This picture is misleading, it is not one of the food boxes we are delivering directly to the homes of extremely medically vulnerable people.</p> \n   <p>Our food boxes are of a standard that is consistent and include cereal, fruit and vegetables and pasta. As much as possible, this is a package that is universally suitable, and will provide enough food for one person for one week.</p> \n   <p>Councils have been issued with some additional supplies to help kickstart their wider efforts \u2013 but these should not be confused for a food box.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-31T16:07:19.715Z\">at 5.07pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e835a978f08af215f6feeb3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/iansample\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-31T14:59:28.832Z\">3.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Two behavioural scientists have written to <strong>Chris Whitty</strong>, the chief medical officer for England, to warn about the potential unintended consequences of mass public testing for coronavirus infection.</p> \n  <p>Prof Madelynne Arden at Sheffield Hallam University and Prof Christopher Armitage at the University of Manchester have told Whitty they felt compelled to share their concerns about the likely impact of mass testing on the public\u2019s adherence to the lockdown and social distancing measures.</p> \n  <p>The scientists believe that people who have had the virus will return to normal life, since they will are likely to have some immunity, but warn this could encourage everyone else to follow suit.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use.

Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Isabella Mulholland, a domestic violence caseworker at the Public Interest Law Centre, said: \u201cWe are concerned about the disproportionate impact that lockdown measures are having on survivors of domestic violence. It is unacceptable for the government to simply point to a general fund which has been allocated to all those in need. Instead, it must secure specific funding for survivors to ensure they are able to access specialist services and safe and suitable accommodation.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe reality is that local authorities are unable \u2013 and in many cases unwilling \u2013 to support and protect women effectively unless the government provides adequate resources, guidance and training.

Others said nurseries had closed quickly after the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, outlined furloughing arrangements for paying staff 80% of their salary.</p> <p>Many NHS staff said they had been told they should not drop children at nursery the morning after a nightshift, as they would be at home and should be able to care for them themselves. This meant they were unable to sleep between shifts.</p> <p>A number of health workers said they had had to reduce their hours or cancel shifts as a result of these problems. \u201cI really want to help at this difficult time, but its seems like childcare is failing us.

There are no official figures for closures because providers are not currently required to report closures due to coronavirus to Ofsted.</p> <p>Nursery staff said their position was very difficult. Purnima Tanuku, the chief executive of the National Day Nurseries Association, said: \u201cThese dedicated practitioners are going to work every day knowing that very young children are unable to understand social distancing. They have little or no protective equipment and many are paid minimum wages or just above.</p> <p>\u201cMany nurseries are managing to stay open despite all the challenges of having very little income and juggling staffing rotas. We have members who are running at losses of almost \u00a31,000 a week to provide care for the small number of children they have. They deserve credit as their staff are risking their own health going to work so that doctors, nurses and other key workers can do their crucial jobs.\u201d</p> <p>Natalie Huntingdon, who runs a nursery in Yorkshire, said: \u201cWe are expecting staff to work in high risk situations, caring for the children of frontline workers. If a one-year-old whose parents are doctors and working with Covid-19 parents needs a cuddle, we cannot social distance. The chances of illness are huge.\u201d</p> <p>Cheryl Hadland, who owns 30 nurseries on the south coast, six of them near hospitals, said: \u201cThe majority of my staff want to do their bit to help the NHS, but there is a lot of fear. They are being asked to put themselves on the frontline, working with children of NHS workers, with no masks and no protective equipment, paid at least half what a nurse is paid, let alone a doctor. You can understand why fear might make people want to stay at home and protect their own families.\u201d</p> <p>Several doctors across the UK, who originally outlined their problems on a doctors\u2019 parenting Facebook group, said they were being asked to pay full fees, even after the nursery had closed, so that it could continue as a business once the crisis is over.</p> <p>One doctor said she and her husband, who both work in an NHS hospital in acute and emergency roles, have had to hire a nanny because their nursery could not guarantee it would remain open. \u201cNow we have to pay the additional massive cost of a nanny to cover childcare,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Doctors said these difficulties were having an impact on staffing at hospitals and GP practices. \u201cPeople have had nurseries close at lunchtime and had to cancel a shift the next day as they hadn\u2019t had any notice,\u201d one said</p> <p>The abruptness of the closures has made things particularly difficult for medical staff, who are already under pressure at work. \u201cOur nursery is next to the hospital and told us last week that they wouldn\u2019t close as 80% of children attending have parents that are key workers. They closed at the end of last week,\u201d one GP said, adding that she was obliged to continue paying half-fees to retain a place for the future, and was simultaneously paying for alternative emergency childcare.</p> <p>Sarah Jeffery, another frontline doctor was told on Friday that her nursery would remain open for key workers. \u201cThen on Monday afternoon they emailed that they were closing. They offered no real explanation, no apology and no alternative options,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Neil Leitch, the chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, said: \u201cWe know that for key workers reliant on childcare to be able to continue to work, the temporary closure of their nursery, pre-school or childminder is deeply concerning.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately, more and more childcare providers are having to take the extremely difficult decision to close, either because a loss of staff through self-isolation or sickness has made staying open impossible, or increasingly, because a sharp fall in the number of children attending has made doing so completely unviable.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>As the US continues its scrambling response to the coronavirus outbreak, it has closed borders, quarantined some neighborhoods, and shut down businesses in a number of the most populous states.</p> <p>Behind the scenes, federal and state governments have also been pushing for a series of draconian measures to respond to the virus, which would disproportionately affect asylum seekers, people embroiled in the justice system and even those seeking an abortion.</p> <p>The efforts have already had a striking impact on civil liberties, and bear hints of a 2020 version of the US government response to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/september11\">9/11 attacks</a> in 2001, which ultimately led to the Patriot Act, a sweeping piece of legislation that allowed, among other things, the government to collect citizens\u2019 phone data, in an unprecedented encroachment on personal rights.</p> <p>Amid the indisputable need to contain the coronavirus outbreak, many of the measures have civil rights advocates concerned. With the Trump administration\u2019s poor record on openness and on freedom \u2013 seen especially in its treatment of undocumented workers \u2013 there is a real risk of Covid-19 having a permanent impact on society.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/i-have-a-broken-heart-trump-policy-has-immigrants-backing-away-from-healthcare-amid-crisis\">'I have a broken heart': Trump policy has immigrants backing away from healthcare amid crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of the most troubling efforts is a government proposal that would allow it to detain people indefinitely without trial during national emergencies. The justice department sent a request for the move to Congress around 20 March, in response to the coronavirus outbreak.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/doj-coronavirus-emergency-powers-140023\">Politico viewed </a><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/doj-coronavirus-emergency-powers-140023\">justice </a><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/doj-coronavirus-emergency-powers-140023\">department documents</a> sent to Congress detailing the measure which would allow the justice department to ask federal chief judges to detain citizens without trial. One document would mean the attorney general \u2013 currently the controversial Trump-supporting Bill Barr \u2013 could ask judges in a district court to pause court proceedings \u201cwhenever the district court is fully or partially closed by virtue of any natural disaster, civil disobedience, or other emergency situation\u201d.</p> <p>Norman L Reimer, executive director of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, told Politico that the proposal would affect \u201cpre-arrest\u201d cases.</p> <p>\u201cSo that means you could be arrested and never brought before a judge until they decide that the emergency or the civil disobedience is over,\u201d Reimer said. \u201cI find it absolutely terrifying. Especially in a time of emergency, we should be very careful about granting new powers to the government.\u201d</p> <p>The request is even more troubling given Trump\u2019s willingness to use national emergencies for political motives. In February 2019 Trump declared a national emergency in an attempt to force through money to construct his border wall. </p> <p>With the House currently dominated by Democrats, the measure is unlikely to be approved, although the election in November could change the dynamic, especially as Trump has risen in popularity in recent polls.</p> <p>Other proposals hit asylum seekers and undocumented immigrants hardest. The justice department recommended Congress enact measures which would mean people with confirmed cases of Covid-19 not be allowed to apply for asylum, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/coronavirus-crippling-courts-raising-concerns-civil-liberties-advocates/story?id=69757862\">ABC News reported</a>. The department is also seeking to deport undocumented immigrants who are confirmed to have the virus. The department\u2019s proposal would send those immigrants back to their home countries, regardless of whether they are unsafe.</p> <p>While those rules depend on congressional support, other measures are already being enacted which impede individual rights.</p> <p>Dozens of courts across the US have already been closed due to the coronavirus, and the inherent difficulty of selecting a jury at a time when many Americans are being told to social-distance means further delays are inevitable.</p> <p>Elsewhere, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/ohio-texas-abortion-us-coronavirus-outbreak\">Texas and Ohio have banned almost all abortions</a> in response to the coronavirus, a move it claimed followed federal guidance, but one which fits neatly with their previous efforts to restrict access to abortion. Under the Texas order any medical worker providing an abortion can be fined $1,000, claiming abortions fit within federal government guidelines which prohibit non-essential surgery.</p> <p>In response to the order, Planned Parenthood and others filed an emergency lawsuit on Wednesday, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/emaoconnor/planned-parenthood-lawsuit-texas-abortion-ban-coronavirus\">Buzzfeed reported</a>, stating the move is unconstitutional. Nancy Northup, head of the Center for Reproductive Rights, accused Texas\u2019s attorney general, Ken Paxton, of \u201cexploiting this pandemic to end abortion in the state\u201d.</p> <p>Some of the most vulnerable are those detained by US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. As cities have released some low-level offenders from jail, Ice has remained resolute in refusing to release undocumented people from its detention centers. With social distancing almost impossible in detention centers, lawyers and advocates fear the consequences could be severe.</p> <p>Last Wednesday Ice confirmed it had pepper-sprayed detainees during a briefing on the coronavirus at a center in Louisiana, alleging they had become confrontational. Ice told CBS News pepper spray had also been used on detainees at two other centers, following protests where undocumented people asked to be released.</p>",

  "<p>Like millions of others whose regular job is deemed less than essential to the survival of others, I have wanted to find, in these strangest of times, a way to make myself useful.</p> <p>A throat infection forced me into self-isolation as, outside, the crisis deepened. But on the first day I\u2019m allowed to go out, there\u2019s a call for NHS volunteers. I sign up together <a href=\"https://www.goodsamapp.org/NHSvolunteerresponders\">749,000 others</a>, and I also enrol with the Red Cross reserves and <a href=\"https://covidmutualaid.org/\">Covid-19 Mutual Aid UK</a>, which supports local community groups. My first call to action comes from the <a href=\"https://peoplesarmy.coronacorps.com/\">People\u2019s Army</a>, a rapidly growing collection of<strong> </strong>my fellow residents of Islington, north London, most of whom have never met, liaising via WhatsApp to support those in need \u2013 be they vulnerable because of age or underlying health conditions, or left stranded by the recent closure of food banks due to the crisis.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I collect the package, marked with my name and left by an unseen hand by the pillar</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The army, or at least my battalion of it, is commanded by Hazel Jhugroo, a 29-year-old stay-at-home mum, who lives with her six-year-old son. She WhatsApps me a shopping list and instructs me to deliver the goods to an address off Essex Road. When I get there, I\u2019m to message her and she will tell me where to leave it. I stand in the spaced queue outside Budgens. No one looks at each other. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve noticed with the distancing rules: people avoiding eye contact, as though a stray glance could contaminate.</p> <p>Once inside, I swerve up and down the aisles, grabbing items for my list, while maintaining a two-metre distance from fellow shoppers. It\u2019s not until I am standing in the spaced checkout queue that a glance to double-check the list on my phone reveals my battery is on 14%. This might not seem critical, but I have noticed of later that my phone has a tendency to run down from 10% to zero in as many seconds. My basket is full of frozen goods: ice-cream, frozen peas and fish. I am a fool. A green recruit. I jog/walk all the way to Essex Road, sprint for the door (there are several flats), text Hazel, and my phone goes dead. I leave the bag on the step, stand back two metres, three for good measure, and wait. At last, the door opens, a face peers out. I wave, and a hand takes the bag. First mission accomplished.</p> <p>At home, I pick up a power pack, plug in my phone and immediately receive my next instructions. A package has been left for me to collect behind a pillar on Upper Street. When I was maybe nine, I founded a spying society. I was Agent X, I remember, and persuaded two friends to be Agents Y and Z. We\u2019d comb the recreation ground looking for clues, attempt to decode a shopping list dropped on the muddy path beside the allotments. Adult life has proved less thrilling, until now, until this. I collect the package, marked with my name and left by an unseen hand behind the pillar.</p> <p>Next up, another shopping list, for Charles, who lives off City Road. Charles\u2019s list is very specific. This particular bread from the Polish deli, this yoghurt from the Turkish shop. I like this. I like Charles, though I\u2019ve never met him. I like the fact he trusts me with such detail, trusts me to understand that details are important, that our lives are stitched together with small preferences. I determine that in his isolation Charles will have as many of his preferences as possible, and deliver his shopping with a feeling of satisfaction.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/29/our-basic-decency-is-clear-but-good-society-needs-more-than-decency\">Our basic decency is clear. But a good society needs more than decency</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The rest of the day is spent collecting care packages \u2013 vegetables, milk, bread, polenta cake \u2013 donated by various shops and cafes, and delivering them to those in need. My trail crisscrosses Islington like tangled string in the paws of a playful kitten. Heads poke out of upper-floor windows, entryphones issue disembodied thanks, two children wave down from a balcony near Old Street roundabout.</p> <p>Next morning, out early with my dog, I meet a young woman in jogging pants and we briefly chat from a distance. How are you finding it? I ask. Not good. She doesn\u2019t want to stay in. They should just let us get it, she says to me, survival of the fittest. I stare at her but she doesn\u2019t appear to be joking. Nor to appreciate the irony that she is talking to someone pushing an ageing three-legged dog in a buggy.</p> <p>I think of Charles and his particular list, of the millions like him and not at all like him, the face at the window, the hand round the door, each life inestimably precious. I think of the thousands striving to help them, and in doing so, helping ourselves. For there is no \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d in this, I think. Just \u201cus\u201d.

In his down time, he is taking up a DIY challenge to make a patchwork quilt based on a dress he made during the filming of Next in Fashion, using other designers\u2019 leftover scraps. The design \u2013 inspired by concerns over the melting polar ice caps \u2013 is an arctic landscape. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a19337d0a374a63543ad9d29aebc0e437c8695e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a19337d0a374a63543ad9d29aebc0e437c8695e3/0_0_3024_4032/750.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel W.Fletcher making a patchwork quilt\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daniel Fletcher making his patchwork quilt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abbi Fletcher</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cEver since the show, I\u2019ve been inundated with requests to make similar quilted items, so I thought this was a good opportunity to show people how they can do so themselves.</p> <p>\u201cYou can make it from any leftover fabrics you have. This time, I used some leftover damaged denim from my studio as the quilt base. I don\u2019t imagine everyone has that lying around so use what you have.</p> <p>\u201cHeavier is better for the base so it can hold the appliqu\u00e9 \u2013 maybe some old curtains or an existing blanket that needs some love. If you don\u2019t have enough to do a blanket, you could use the same technique to make a cushion. For the appliqu\u00e9, it could be old clothes, tablecloths, tea towels \u2013 anything you can get your hands on.</p> <p>\u201cI went quite abstract with my pattern, but you could come up with a more elaborate design.</p> <p>\u201cMine took me five hours on a sewing machine. You could hand sew it instead. It\u2019s going to be a much longer process but could be very therapeutic, which is something we could all do with right now.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0dd16f8404f1824f923dd364630fb1647674df36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0dd16f8404f1824f923dd364630fb1647674df36/0_0_3024_3780/800.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel W Fletcher with his finished patchwork quilt\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daniel W Fletcher with his finished patchwork quilt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abbi Fletcher</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Difficulty level:</strong> intermediate<br><strong>Equipment needed:</strong> an old blanket (or similar), scraps of fabrics, thread, sewing machine needle</p> <p><strong>How to:</strong></p> <p>\u201cFor the nitty-gritty, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/danielwfletcher/?hl=en\">head over to my Instagram</a> \u2013 my wonderful sister captured the whole process.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/B-P9CcHJbql/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Thankfully @abbifletcher was there to document it \ud83e\udd74 I\u2019m always looking for ways to reduce my waste and make use of fabric scraps from the studio. So inspired by my @nextinfashion denim challenge I created this arctic landscape throw. You can use anything for this, old clothes, tea towels, your own waste from sewing projects, basically this should be about using up what you have not buying new. You\u2019ll need a base, this could be an old bed sheet, curtains, an existing blanket that needs updating; any size will do but mine was 140cm x 140cm made from some damaged denim from the studio. Cut it into a square then start laying out your scraps to create your landscape scene. Start from the back and work your way to the bottom of the square. Cut the scraps into rough points, there are no real rules to this, it can be as neat or as messy as you like. Pin everything down then start to sew. Don\u2019t worry about it being too neat here either, just sew along the edge of each piece until they are all attached. You can also do a few extra stitch lines so they look like mountain trails and to make sure all the fabric is secure.  To finish it off I added a bias binding around the edge but you could also fold it over twice and stitch down if you don\u2019t have any binding. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve missed some things out but let me know your question in the comments and I\u2019ll try and answer as many as I can! Can\u2019t wait to see all of your creations! Stay safe and stay home xx</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/danielwfletcher/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> DANIEL w.

At Liam Hodges, we&#39;ve been learning to crochet sporadically over the last months, making it up as we go and along and watching youtube tutorials for some help when needed. This week at home, Liam designed an \u2018ISOL8\u2019 rug for everyone staying in. The rug can be made from old clothes / fabric that you would throw away, or normal yarn.  Materials used: A mixture of old t-shirts (4 beige / green and 2 tie dye) along with @woolandthegang\u2019s jersey be good black yarn made from industrial waste from the manufacturing of garments.  Send us or tag us in your attempts or anything else you\u2019ve been learning and making during this time at home. #STAYATHOME</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/liam__hodges/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> LIAM HODGES</a> (@liam__hodges) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2020-03-27T11:56:54+00:00\">Mar 27, 2020 at 4:56am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> </figure>  <h2>Sew a shark mascot with designer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/jan/05/christopher-raeburn-sustainable-design-london-fashion-week-mens\">Christopher Raeburn</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8bbcf4f6c6e2ca02f998a81612d118cdcdf46c79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8bbcf4f6c6e2ca02f998a81612d118cdcdf46c79/0_0_2250_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Christopher Raeburn shark mascot\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Christopher Raeburn shark mascot</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Broomfield/benbroomfield.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Designer Christopher Raeburn\u2019s team are adapting to the current situation by releasing weekly creative tasks via their <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Raeburn_Design\">#RaeburnAtHome</a> initiative.</p> <p>\u201cThis project is to make one of our shark mascots. We have always featured animals in our collections, initially as a way to highlight and support endangered species through our WWF UK partner. The Shark is one of our most popular animals; we keep it in our collections each season, but it always evolves.</p> <p>\u201cYou need no more than one square metre of fabric \u2013 even less if you are conscious of pattern placement for waste reduction. Using a variety of smaller cuts of fabric is encouraged though as this adds pops of colour and texture to the final shark.</p> <p>\u201cNot only is reusing and repurposing old fabric a more interesting way of working, but extending the lifetime of garments is instrumental in reducing planetary impact. When people are spending more time at home than ever before, now is the chance to pull out those bits that we no longer use and give them new life.</p> <p>\u201cUnless you are an absolute master, it should keep you busy for about 10 hours. We only recommend a sewing machine for ease and speed \u2013 top marks for effort go to anyone tackles it by hand.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Difficulty level:</strong> advanced<br><strong>Equipment needed:</strong> a sewing machine, fabric, scissors, thread and paper.</p> <p><strong>How to:</strong></p> <p>For the <a href=\"https://www.raeburndesign.co.uk/explore/journal/post/id/diy-shark-mascot-raeburn-at-home\">full instructions click here</a>; you can <a href=\"https://www.raeburndesign.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Raeburn-Shark-Mascot-A4-Print.pdf\">download the shark pattern here</a>.

His first was to cut a pattern for and sew a one-piece kimono-inspired garment. Next up is making miniature sculptures of the kings and queens of England using modelling clay.</p> <p>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Make-Your-Own-Japanese-Clothes/dp/1568364938\">How to make Japanese clothes</a> by John Marshall is a book I have on my shelf that I thought it would be great to lose myself in during isolation.</p> <p>\u201cI love traditional Japanese clothing and now is the perfect time to study. What I love about kimonos is that they are traditionally dictated by the fabric \u2013 they are the width they are because that is how wide the looms could weave. For a fabric geek like me, that\u2019s a dream.</p> <p>\u201cA traditional kimono pattern looks like some different-length rectangles put together, but nothing is ever that simple and it takes a lot of skill to construct a traditional kimono properly. The one I made is much, much easier.</p> <p>\u201cI used three metres of fabric left over from the last collection, but you could make it with two metres if it\u2019s 150cm wide, or you can easily add seams to the patterns or patchwork fabrics together. Repurposing old curtains or a bed sheet would be perfect.</p> <p>\u201cIt took me around four hours to complete \u2013 there are only three seams and three hems. I tried to make it as simple as possible.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Difficulty level:</strong> advanced<br><strong>Equipment needed:</strong> a sewing machine, two to three metres of fabric, thread, scissors, paper and dressmaking pins.</p> <p><strong>How to:</strong></p> <p>\u201cThe pattern I made is available to <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/u477xf47t0mj0im/AAAZK_dmuqJij-P-Aw93H3I5a/ONE%20PIECE%20ROBE?dl=0&amp;subfolder_nav_tracking=1\">download for free here</a>.

This so-called shrinky necklace is something we did as kids. We first made one as Tatty Devine in 2001. It was very early days, when we made jewellery from whatever we could get our hands on. We enjoyed <em>having</em> to eat crisps.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Difficulty level:</strong> beginner<br><strong>Equipment needed:</strong> old crisp packets (not foiled or metallic, such as Chipsticks or many supermarket own brands); a chain necklace (whether new or something you already own); greaseproof paper, a baking tray, a damp tea towel (for safety reasons), an old tea towel, a hole punch, a regular <a href=\"https://www.the-beadshop.co.uk/beads-and-beading-supplies-c491/jewellery-findings-c7/jump-rings-c12/silver-plated-jump-rings-c14\">jump ring</a> and two pairs of flat-nose pliers.</p> <p><strong>How to:</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Set your grill to medium.</p></li> <li><p>While the grill is warming, fold the greaseproof paper to make it into rough envelope shapes and pop your empty food packets inside \u2013 one wrapper per envelope.</p></li> <li><p>Put the envelopes on a baking tray under the grill. The packet will start to shrink and curl up. You don\u2019t want them to burn or blister so watch closely.</p></li> <li><p>As soon as they are shrunken enough, remove the baking tray, quickly place a folded tea towel on top of the envelope and slam your hand down to flatten your \u201cshrinky\u201d.</p></li> <li><p>Use a hole punch to make a hole somewhere on the packet.</p></li> <li><p>Open a <a href=\"https://beadclublounge.com/what-are-jump-rings/\">regular jump ring</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOkBbCx7MP4\">with the pliers</a> and thread the packet on to the jump ring, then put the jump ring on to the necklace and close it.</p></li> </ul> <p>You can stop with one pendant or layer up for a charm effect.</p> <h2>Knit a scarf with dancer Meshach Henry</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5f646d1bea95fa174c71e2d72eb22a4c6ae90ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5f646d1bea95fa174c71e2d72eb22a4c6ae90ed/0_0_828_1327/624.jpg\" alt=\"Novice knitter Meshach Henry\" width=\"624\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Novice knitter Meshach Henry</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Grimshaw/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite having no previous knitting experience, dancer Meshach Henry has made three scarves in as many days, documented on Instagram by his partner, the Radio 1 DJ Nick Grimshaw.</p> <p>\u201cI always said I would learn a new skill like plumbing or plastering if I ever had a lot of time on my hands. But they aren\u2019t ideal skills to practice in this current situation. So, having seen knitting supplies in a craftshop window recently, I thought, \u2018Here\u2019s my new hobby.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cI <a href=\"ttps://www.theknittingnetwork.co.uk/hayfield-bonus-super-chunky-berry-652?gclid=CjwKCAjwvOHzBRBoEiwA48i6Agw3S5RtfL5d5H6CnxtG3WWSPo5wA7_GTJeV9sZt29WqomOAWQAimBoCQwcQAvD_BwE\">purchased a thick wool</a> because it looked easier to use and less fiddly. I bought 10mm knitting needles, which I thought were an average size but later found out are strangely big \u2013 but I\u2019m really happy with the chunky effect they produce.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I like about knitting is that you can see your physical product. As a dancer, I rarely get to see my own work, so to be able to see and hold this tangible thing is a whole new world for me.</p> <p>\u201cMy intention is to move on to knitting jumpers.

  "<p>A prominent Pakistani journalist who fled the country after receiving death threats has gone missing in Sweden where he had been granted political asylum.</p> <p>Sajid Hussain, 39, went into self-imposed exile in 2012 after his reporting on forced disappearances and human rights abuses in the turbulent region of Balochistan had led to death threats. He had continued to run an online newspaper, the <a href=\"https://balochistantimes.com/\">Balochistan Times</a>, from abroad covering the same topics.</p> <p>Hussain was last seen at around 11am on 2 March in the Swedish city of Uppsala where he was living. A day after he stopped answering calls, a friend told the police about his disappearance and he was officially registered as a missing person on 5 March.</p> <p>Daniel Bastard, the Asia Pacific head of Reporters Without Borders, said: \u201cHussain could be a victim of enforced disappearance, given the circumstances of his case and testimony by his family and colleagues. Now, when you think about who could find interest in suppressing a dissident journalist, the first hypothesis leads to Pakistan\u2019s security agencies.\u201d</p> <p>Hussain\u2019s family have not accused anyone of involvement in his disappearance and are simply urging the Swedish police to give them an answer.</p> <p>Hussain\u2019s wife, Shahnaz Baloch, is still in Pakistan with their two children, aged five and nine, but was due to join her husband in Sweden this year. She wasone of the last people to speak to him on the morning he went missing. She said he had been in good spirits and they had spoken about his plans to move apartments before he started a master\u2019s degree at Uppsala University.</p> <p>\u201cSajid never went anywhere without informing me and his close friends,\u201d Baloch said. \u201cThis is very unusual and disturbing. Swedish police have been slow in working on the case as they believe people go in isolation in Sweden.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cHe was a voice for thousands of people living inside and outside of Balochistan. I believe an outside force is involved in his disappearance because Sajid would not disappear without informing anyone. He was an influential journalist and writer and had faced threats before.\u201d</p> <p>Hussain is from a well-known political family in Balochistan, which has long been a battleground between armed insurgents and security forces. His uncle Ghulam Mohammad Baloch was killed in 2011 while heading a nationalist movement.</p> <p>Hussain had worked for numerous news outlets in Pakistan, reporting on abuses in Balochistan around drugs, human rights and enforced disappearances, but fled the country in 2012 when police raided his house, taking his laptop and interrogating his family, and intelligence services visited his associates. Hussain had continued his journalism as he moved from the United Arab Emirates, Oman and then Uganda before settling in Sweden in 2018, and was given political asylum in 2019.</p> <p>Talat Aslam, the editor of News International, one of Pakistan\u2019s largest English-language newspapers, who worked with Hussain for five years, said: \u201cThe case is so baffling and I am so worried for him. His asylum case had been accepted and everything was going well. He had told me that he even planned to take his family out there as the authorities in Sweden had interviewed them.</p> <p>\u201cThis is very mysterious and very depressing. I have tried to write to police in Sweden and contacted other concerned authorities about the case, but they are very evasive.\u201d</p> <p>Pakistan is one of the most dangerous countries to be a journalist and there have been increased reports recently of exiled reporters and bloggers based in Europe facing threats. In February, Ahmad Waqass Goraya, a Pakistani blogger living in Rotterdam, was attacked and threatened outside his home by two figures allegedly from the Pakistan intelligence agency.</p>",

This is especially so given the misinformation and fake news permeating the narrative surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic.\u2019</p> \n   <p>The archives continues to fulfil this role despite closing its public spaces across the country, and cancelling all events and programs until further notice. </p> \n   <p>\u2018Our vast online catalogue, RecordSearch, contains millions of pages of digitised content from the national archival collection \u2013 this is available free of charge to all. Members of the public can request analogue records be digitised and added to RecordSearch.</p> \n   <p>\u2018We are also available online to support the public with their research queries. Crucially the national archives is ready to help any Australian who needs certified copies of documents from the collection related to them, to support a claim for government payments or other assistance.\u2019</p> \n   <p>To keep Australians remaining at home connected to each other, and to their documentary heritage, the archives has developed the #ArchivesAtHome Toolkit. This online toolkit comprises collection highlights shared daily on its social media channels, virtual exhibitions, kids\u2019 activities, tips for amateur genealogists and information on how to safely preserve precious family documents, photos and videos.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-31T03:52:15.526Z\">at 4.52am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e82b9538f08af215f6fe8e6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-31T03:31:34.536Z\">4.31am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A navy hospital ship with 1,000 beds has reached New York, which is struggling under the weight of critical Covid-19 cases.</p> \n  <p><strong>Hugh Jackman </strong>was among those waving it in.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/oyecomovapart2/status/1244643914423943168\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/USComfort?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#USComfort</a> \ud83d\udea2 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Hospital?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Hospital</a> with 1000K beds arrive to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NewYork?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#NewYork</a> \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/science?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#science</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/supplies?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#supplies</a> \ud83d\ude37\ud83d\ude37 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ventilators?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ventilators</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/3Dprinters?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#3Dprinters</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/technology?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#technology</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/USA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#USA</a> \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronavirus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#coronavirus</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pandemia?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Pandemia</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BreakingNews?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BreakingNews</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID2019?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID2019</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronavirusupdate?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#coronavirusupdate</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/worldnews?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#worldnews</a><br> \ud83d\udcfd : <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RealHughJackman?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@RealHughJackman</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/2TAmcFNofV\">pic.twitter.com/2TAmcFNofV</a></p>\u2014 oyecomovapart2 (@oyecomovapart2) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/oyecomovapart2/status/1244643914423943168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 30, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-31T03:33:54.880Z\">at 4.33am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e82b8738f08af215f6fe8df\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-31T03:28:12.907Z\">4.28am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/explainer-what-is-the-national-cabinet-and-is-it-democratic-135036\">The Conversation has published a piece on the national cabinet</a> (which is just the council of Australian governments with a fancy war-timey name) by Griffith University\u2019s <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/profiles/jennifer-menzies-8509\">Jennifer Menzies</a>.</p> \n  <p>It appears to have been written for <strong>Naomi Wolf</strong>, but you may find some answers in there too. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-31T03:28:52.369Z\">at 4.28am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e82b7f48f0866297e9f3f92\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/calla-wahlquist\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-31T03:24:54.134Z\">4.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Victoria adds 96 cases, bringing total to 917</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Victoria has recorded <strong>another 96 cases of Covid-19, bringing the total to 917.</strong></p> \n  <p>The new cases include four children under five, bringing the number of pre-school-aged children to have tested positive in Victoria to five. </p> \n  <p>Nationally 14 children under five have tested positive to Covid-19.

An additional 20,000 are in California on H2A visas, a visa category that has seen some processing delays amid coronavirus shutdown orders.</p> <p>In March, as the coronavirus spread across the US and California ordered residents to stay at home, the United Farm Workers of America sent <a href=\"https://ufw.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COVID-19-2020-Open-Letter-from-UFW-FINAL.pdf\">an open letter</a> to agricultural employers calling for more sick pay, protections and information for workers in the fields.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we noted immediately was that workers were not being provided protections or information. [Growers are] not even trying. And that\u2019s gotten workers very scared,\u201d said Armando Elenes, secretary-treasurer of the United Farm Workers of America. \u201cThe last hands that touched that produce before the consumer puts it in their mouth is a farm worker\u2019s hands, so we better care about what happens to these workers.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed at the notion of growers voluntarily offering hazard pay to compensate for their new risks, as some frontline workers in other sectors have demanded. \u201cThe \u2018essential\u2019 part doesn\u2019t show up on their paycheck. They\u2019re lucky to get minimum wage,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re getting paid the same, yet they\u2019re exposing themselves to more dangers,\u201d said Irene de Barraicua, spokesperson for L\u00edderes Campesinas,<strong> </strong>an advocacy organization of and for California female farm workers.<strong> </strong>\u201cThere is no standard for safety orientation. Sometimes we\u2019re hearing they just get a five-minute talk \u2013 stay six feet apart, don\u2019t do this, don\u2019t do that \u2013 but they\u2019re working in big crowds. It feels like it\u2019s not being taken seriously because the money is more important.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"37813604ca93f96c04ccdf57706029ae366394a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37813604ca93f96c04ccdf57706029ae366394a5/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Workers harvest celery in Oxnard, California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Workers harvest celery in Oxnard, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brent Stirton/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>L\u00edderes Campesinas is working to arrange for health professionals to train farm workers on keeping themselves safe, a program they hope would be made mandatory in agricultural counties. For now, growers and farm labor contractors are doing it themselves.</p> <p>\u201cWe think that if you do what all the health experts have explained \u2013 if you can keep your social distance, if you can keep things sanitized, if you can keep sick people at home \u2013 we believe that people can work safely,\u201d said Lupe Sandoval, managing director of the California Farm Labor Contractor Association.</p> <p>The association is advising farm labor contractors on best practices to prevent viral spread. Sandoval said some of the contractors who serve as middlemen between farm workers and growers<em> </em>are spacing workers out in the fields and stepping up the sanitization of toilets, water jugs and rest break tables, while some are even considering \u201cbusting out the forehead thermometers\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere are a lot of employers jumping through a lot of hoops right now trying to figure out how to make this happen properly,\u201d he said.</p> <p>With the more farming-intensive spring season about to set in, and a surge in Covid-19 cases expected statewide, there\u2019s a small and rapidly closing window to establish meaningful safety measures in the fields. An outbreak in the farm worker community would wreak havoc on an already strained food system. But there are currently no known coronavirus infections in California\u2019s agricultural community, said Sandoval, \u201cand we want to keep it that way\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6b74ce63700845a262d5371e433b7aa804b0c793\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b74ce63700845a262d5371e433b7aa804b0c793/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amparo Sanchez, a 73-year-old from Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico, picks organic strawberries in Valley Center, California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amparo Sanchez, a 73-year-old from Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico, picks organic strawberries in Valley Center, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ariana Drehsler/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Sick workers</strong></h2> <p>Farm workers are an ageing labor force facing higher rates of respiratory disease and hypertension: all factors that would put them at greater risk for more deadly Covid-19 complications. And the masks that shield them from dust and pesticides, and that would also protect against the virus, are now in short supply for frontline workers across the world.</p> <p>If they are unfortunate enough to fall ill with Covid-19, farm workers would qualify for the additional sick leave provided through the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, the national legislation that expanded paid leave amid the Covid-19 crisis, but most would probably struggle to pay the resulting healthcare costs. Many farm workers have no health insurance.</p> <p>While Sandoval worries about workers who would abuse new, more abundant paid leave, Elenes of the United Farm Workers of America remains skeptical that workers will be able to utilize it at all.</p> <p>\u201cIn our experience, workers are ridiculed for even trying to use sick pay. They\u2019re asked if they have a doctor\u2019s note, but they don\u2019t even have healthcare. Or sometimes they just flat out deny them,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The disease and California\u2019s response to it have also added pressure to the social services farm workers rely on for routine care and support.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to fill the voids we\u2019re seeing on the ground for the individuals that are most at risk, which are farmworkers \u2013 individuals with chronic diseases, respiratory health illnesses,\u201d said Hernan Hernandez, executive director of the California Farmworkers Foundation. \u201cA lot of organizations have been pulling out of communities for the safety of their own staff. I want to make sure my staff are safe and secure, too. But this is not the time to hide behind your desk or at home, you\u2019ve got to be at the forefront. The situation is critical.\u201d</p> <p>The California Farmworker Foundation operates primarily in the state\u2019s Central Valley, an agricultural stronghold home to the nation\u2019s most productive farming counties and many thousands of vulnerable, low-wage farm workers. In response to Covid-19, the organization is launching a pop-up telemedicine clinic, increasing food distributions to farm worker communities, and partnering with growers to provide education on the virus at work sites.</p> <p>Hernandez is concerned that the loss of vital services could be just as dangerous to farm worker communities as the virus itself, especially if necessary routine medical care is reduced.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3e9b86a476d7bd1886c23a01d96d00dc1bc8e779\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e9b86a476d7bd1886c23a01d96d00dc1bc8e779/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Agriculture workers in Oxnard wear face masks as they pack celery for shipping.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Agriculture workers in Oxnard wear face masks as they pack celery for shipping.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brent Stirton/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Trickling </strong><strong>down</strong></h2> <p>Even as grocery stores struggle to keep shelves stocked, farm workers and their advocates worry their essential work could nonetheless dry up.</p> <p>\u201cEverything\u2019s slowing down, and it\u2019s going to trickle down in the next couple of weeks,\u201d said Hernandez. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see less work for farm workers. So everybody\u2019s fearful right now.\u201d</p> <p>That scenario is already playing out in some sectors of California agriculture.</p> <p>\u201cMany workers are having their hours cut. Business is low so they don\u2019t have work for people. And they don\u2019t really give them any notice,\u201d said De Barraicua.</p> <p>Growers maintain that overall, the food system is healthy,<strong> </strong>but the near total closure of food service in restaurants, event centers, office parks and college campuses has decimated business for some farms.</p> <p>\u201cThe foodservice sector represents roughly half of all fresh produce sales,\u201d said Cory Lunde, a spokesman for<strong> </strong>the Western Growers Association. \u201cWith the near-complete evaporation of this outlet for fresh produce, many growers in Arizona and California have seen their orders cancelled, or requests for delays in payment from their buyers.\u201d</p> <p>Farming logistics and existing supply chains leave many of these farmers with inventory rotting in cold storage or still stuck in the dirt.</p> <p>\u201cWe are concerned that while the larger operations may be better equipped to survive this market disruption, many of the smaller farms may be unable to absorb the financial shock,\u201d said Lunde.</p> <p>That shock is passed down to farm workers who are even less capable of absorbing it. In the case that they lose work, the undocumented majority of farm workers would not be eligible for expanded unemployment benefits or the one-time $1,200 payment from the federal government.</p> <p>Strawberry picker Amadeo Sumano lives with seven other people in an apartment, stoking his concerns about exposure to coronavirus.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bfa6efe32ba30aeaae35be1f9ab3bbc756e022ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfa6efe32ba30aeaae35be1f9ab3bbc756e022ec/0_0_3170_2550/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Strawberries are ripe for picking.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"804\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Strawberries ripe for picking.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris O\u2019Meara/Associated Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI have lived and worked in this country for many years and paid taxes, but cannot access benefits,\u201d said Sumano. \u201cIf either working hours are cut or we contract the virus, we are likely to not be able to pay rent and would become homeless.\u201d</p> <p>While the coronavirus stimulus package contains billions to support agriculture businesses hit by Covid-19 shutdowns, there will be no bailout for the essential workers who still pick the nation\u2019s strawberries with their bare hands.</p>",

His policy further requires tenants declare in writing that they can\u2019t pay due to Covid-19, and that they have documentation, which could be a hurdle for undocumented workers, people with non-traditional employment and those dealing with medical crises.</p> <p>It also does not stop landlords from moving forward with evictions for reasons other than non-payment, such as remodeling or taking a rental off the market.</p> <p>\u201cIt includes a lot of ways for tenants to trip up,\u201d said Michael Trujillo, staff attorney at the Law Foundation of Silicon Valley\u2019s housing program, adding, \u201cThe governor has the power right now to just prohibit all evictions.\u201d</p> <p>In a state where many workers have to divert a significant portion of their paychecks to rent, activists have called for a complete moratorium on evictions and foreclosures and a statewide suspension of rent, meaning a rent freeze or forgiveness so that tenants do not wind up with insurmountable debts.</p> <p>\u201cFor some, the decision is pay rent and starve, or don\u2019t pay rent and pay for food,\u201d said Chris Estrada, an organizer with the Los Angeles Center for Community Law and Action, which has fielded calls from dozens of tenants who don\u2019t have the cash to pay this week. For many others, he said, the reality is, \u201c\u2018If we pay April, will I starve in May?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In a city such as San Francisco, where the median rent for a one-bedroom is $3,479, paying retroactively will be impossible for many. \u201cIf six months later, I had a $20,000 debt waiting for me that I was expected to pay off right away, that would not be possible, especially after months of not having a stable paycheck,\u201d said Lupe Arreola, executive director of Tenants Together.</p> <p>The city of Oakland has passed what advocates said was the strongest protection in the state, with a <a href=\"https://www.berkeleyside.com/2020/03/27/oakland-passes-2-month-freeze-on-evictions-for-renters-and-small-business-owners\">moratorium</a> that prohibits all evictions and prevents late fees and rent hikes in the next two months.

To some, the beautiful game is a thrilling weekly clash of the titans; to others, an endless parade of stats, inexplicable fortunes and stultifying punditry. <a href=\"https://athleticomince.com/category/podcasts/\">Athletico Mince</a> is the hen\u2019s teeth of football podcasts, in that it has managed to cross that picket line: its listenership comprises equal numbers of football fans and non-fans alike. The reasons for this are simple: no other football podcast is co-hosted by comedy legend and near-as-damn-it national treasure Bob Mortimer, and Athletico Mince is the only football podcast that isn\u2019t actually about football at all.</p> <p>\u201cI was looking at the logo for the podcast and I realised it\u2019s still got two fucking footballs on it,\u201d says its co-creator and co-host Andy Dawson. \u201cWhy have we not had them removed? Because it is not a football thing!\u201d He\u2019s right: it wouldn\u2019t be unfair to say that no one has ever listened to Athletico Mince to learn anything about football. There is no analysis, or debate about a team\u2019s form or a player\u2019s performance. \u201cI can remember giving an opinion on the first or second podcast about [former Manchester City midfielder] Yaya Tour\u00e9,\u201d says Mortimer. \u201cAnd I heard myself doing it, and I thought: \u2018You <em>wanker\u2019.</em> And from then it changed pretty quickly.\u201d \u201cBy episode five, it had become what it is now,\u201d adds Dawson. \u201cIt\u2019s got people from the world of football in it, but they don\u2019t do \u2018football stuff\u2019.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dacb4b806d19589bd8e01cb71222676cc6d8df21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dacb4b806d19589bd8e01cb71222676cc6d8df21/0_0_1400_1400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Athletico Mince logo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Athletico Mince logo</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR HANDOUT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What Mince became is a freewheeling barrage of made-up stories, songs and idle, occasionally football-related blather. You don\u2019t need a dullard\u2019s knowledge of the Premier League to appreciate Mortimer\u2019s alternate reality in which a dimbulb <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/harry-kane\">Harry Kane</a> is the leader of a secret boys\u2019 gang called the White Hearts (group mantra: \u201cFEEL THE FEROCIOUS HEAT!\u201d), or Dawson\u2019s depiction of the former England manager <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/roy-hodgson\">Roy Hodgson</a> as a vaguely terrifying Warhammer obsessive. Another ex-England boss, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/steve-mcclaren\">Steve McClaren</a>, is besotted with his pet snake Caspar and what he calls his \u201chair island\u201d. Mortimer\u2019s lovable Peter Beardsley rambles in tragicomic monologues about his wife, who\u2019s only with him because of his willingness to cook her a litany of egg-based repasts. Then you have a belligerently competitive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn\">Jeremy Corbyn</a>, ambushing Dawson as he goes about his business, or Mortimer\u2019s unlikely encounters with the amorous alderman of Stockton-on-Tees. Neither of those last two, or much of Mince for that matter, have anything to do with football. Football is little more than the broadest possible peg on which to hang a load of glorious nonsense.</p> <p>Today, the pair are speaking from backstage at a sold-out live show in Liverpool, shortly after the podcast\u2019s dual milestones of its 100th episode and fourth birthday (Covid-19 forced them to postpone further dates in London and Cardiff). In terms of popularity \u2013 some 30 million listeners since 2016 \u2013 and longevity, it is evident that they hit upon something. \u201cThe best feedback we get, for me, is when people say: \u2018I don\u2019t really follow football,\u2019 or: \u2018I hate football but I really love this podcast, even though I don\u2019t understand who the characters are,\u2019\u201d says Dawson.</p> <p>Football fans are also hardly starved of alternative, blokes-yelling-at-blokes football-opinion pods, although there was little danger of Mince ever ending up as one of those. \u201cThe thing I despise most,\u201d says Mortimer, not quite as seriously as it may appear in print, \u201cis fucking opinions. Honestly, man, it\u2019s such a waste of a person\u2019s time. There\u2019s opinions frickin\u2019 everywhere today, isn\u2019t there? And people seem to think that it\u2019s something you\u2019d be interested in. \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve got an opinion, people might be interested in that.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It was, however, Dawson\u2019s judicious deployment of such opinions that led to the two of them crossing paths in the first place. \u201cBob just started following me on Twitter,\u201d says Dawson, whose strident tweets as @ProfanitySwan had garnered him a sizable following. \u201cThere was a conversation about a portable plastic greenhouse that I\u2019d bought, that I was really proud of. And Bob just appeared in my mentions telling me it was a load of shit, and that it would blow down in the first slight breeze that came along, and that I was an idiot.\u201d On the surface, Dawson and Mortimer do seem to come at Twitter from irreconcilably different directions: Dawson the keyboard warrior, Mortimer more inclined to offer whimsical cat names for sale, such as \u201cFloating Tiger Hidden Moorhen\u201d, or \u201cButtery Paul\u201d. But the two became regular features in each other\u2019s timelines. \u201cAndy can be funny on Twitter,\u201d says Mortimer. \u201cBut, sadly, he likes getting into barneys. But it\u2019s Andy\u2019s Twitter, innit? He can do what he wants!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60c29298200f9952f8ae3e0ad9611805d9a37e21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60c29298200f9952f8ae3e0ad9611805d9a37e21/0_0_4282_2858/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mortimer and Whitehouse: Gone Fishing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mortimer and Whitehouse: Gone Fishing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Parisa Taghizadeh/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It didn\u2019t take long for the idea of doing a podcast to arise. \u201cThe first night we met up and went for a few drinks, I think I just suggested it,\u201d says Dawson. \u201cAnd then Bob had his heart operation.\u201d Dawson is referring to the triple heart bypass Mortimer underwent in 2015 that led to Mortimer saying \u201cyes\u201d to things he might previously have considered putting off, such as appearing on Would I Lie to You?, going fishing with Paul Whitehouse, or doing a football podcast with a mate he met arguing about greenhouses on Twitter. \u201cIt seemed like a good idea to do it after he was recovering from that, because it was simple,\u201d says Dawson. \u201cI\u2019d never worked with anyone of Bob\u2019s stature before. We ended up kind of just winging it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBest way to do it, innit,\u201d says Mortimer. \u201cPeople tend to think too much about comedy.\u201d</p> <p>It also gave Mortimer a much-needed outlet. \u201cMy long-term comedy partner Jim [Moir, AKA Vic Reeves] has no interest in football whatsoever,\u201d he says, \u201cso it never creeps into any of our shows or anything. And I\u2019d always wanted to do something with football. Jim\u2019s always had a lot of interests, and I think he got a bit guilty because he\u2019s always done historical documentaries, or he does an awful lot with his painting, Coronation Street, the lot. And I never really bothered, to be honest. I just liked working with Jim. I don\u2019t really like working on my own. I like that this is football, because it doesn\u2019t feel rude to Jim. \u201d</p> <p>Both Mortimer and Dawson have plenty going on outside of Mince. Mortimer has enjoyed viral fame with his yuppyish Train Guy, a character strikingly similar to the podcast\u2019s own Barry Homeowner (\u201cI <em>think</em> they\u2019re different, but they\u2019re probably the same, aren\u2019t they?\u201d), while Dawson co-presents another football podcast, Top Flight Time Machine, with Sam Delaney. Even so, the curious, cultish, oddball world of Athletico Mince is something that only Bob and Andy, together, can create.</p> <p>\u201cPeople say they\u2019ll work with someone and they\u2019ll find out the person they work with is a Mince fan, and then they feel as though that\u2019s a little thing that they\u2019ve got,\u201d says Dawson. \u201cIt\u2019s getting bigger and bigger, but it\u2019s still got that niche outsider thing about it.\u201d Although anyone wishing to hop aboard the good train Mince at this point is advised to go back and get stuck in early. There are a lot of in-jokes to catch up on.</p> <p>Or, says Mortimer, putting it succinctly: \u201cIf you came to see it live and you\u2019ve never heard Athletico Mince before, it would be deeply shit.\u201d</p> <h2>Five football podcasts to listen to in the absence of any actual football</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84afcbd3373895262aa0a895f6c3a04e2cfab9db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84afcbd3373895262aa0a895f6c3a04e2cfab9db/0_0_1400_1053/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Searching for Salah podcast\" width=\"1000\" height=\"752\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Searching for Salah podcast.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/series/footballweekly\">Football Weekly</a><br></strong>The Guardian\u2019s own footie round-up has, like Dennis Bergkamp on ice skates, pivoted effortlessly into nostalgia about soccer of the past, kicking off with England v Argentina in 1986 \u2013 a game that had a lot more to it than merely a handball and the best goal of all time.

  "<p>The call came as she sat in her hotel room. \u201cThey gave us 10 minutes to pack up and leave,\u201d Dr Safaa Kumari was told down a crackling phone line. Armed fighters had just seized her house in Aleppo and her family were on the run.</p> <p>Kumari was in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, preparing to present a conference. She immediately began organising a sprint back to Syria. Hidden in her sister\u2019s house was a small but very valuable bundle that she was prepared to risk her life to recover.</p> <p>Kumari is a plant virologist. Her work focuses on a quiet yet devastating development crisis.

Known as \u201cpoor man\u2019s meat\u201d, these pulses are vital for both income generation and food security in many parts of the world.</p> <p>Finding a cure was urgent, Kumari explains. Hopeless farmers were seeing increasing levels of infected crops turning yellow and black. The cause? \u201cClimate change provides aphids with the right temperatures to breed exponentially and spread the epidemics,\u201d she says.</p> <p>For 10 years, Kumari worked to find a solution. Finally, she discovered a bean variety naturally resistant to one of the viruses: the fava bean necrotic yellow virus (FBNYV). \u201cWhen I found those resistant seeds, I felt there was something important in them,\u201d says Kumari from her lab in Lebanon where she now works. Only the fighting in Syria had moved. \u201cI had left them at my sister\u2019s in central Aleppo to protect them from the fighting,\u201d she says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They wanted to buy our product and then sell it to the farmers, but we refused</p> <footer> <cite>Dr Safaa Kumari, plant virologist</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Determined not to let a war get in the way of her work \u201cfor the world\u2019s poor\u201d, Kumari felt it her duty to rescue the seeds in Aleppo. \u201cI was thinking: how am I going to get those seeds out of Syria?</p> <p>\u201cI had to go through Damascus, and then drive all the way to Aleppo.

Zoom Video Communication\u2019s share price has soared from under $70 a share in January, before the coronavirus struck western countries, to $150 on Monday. That gives the company a market value of $42bn \u2013 more than eight times the market capitalisation of British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines Group, for example.</p> <p>Some investors got so excited, they accidentally invested in the wrong Zoom. Shares in Zoom Technologies soared by more than 1,500% as investors rushed to buy shares in what they thought was the video app company \u2013 but was actually a defunct Chinese wireless communications company.</p> <p>The US Securities and Exchange regulator intervened to suspend trading in Zoom Technologies. Investors may have been confused by Zoom Technologies\u2019 use of the stock market ticker ZOOM, while Zoom Video Communication has the ticker ZM.</p> <p>The boom in Zoom Video Communication\u2019s share price has turned its founder and chief executive Eric Yuan into one of the world\u2019s richest people. Yuan, who owns 20% of the company\u2019s shares, has seen his estimated net worth increase by more than $4bn since the Covid-19 crisis started, to $7.9bn.</p> <p>According to the Bloomberg billionaires index, he is currently the 182nd richest person on earth, ahead of legendary investor George Soros, Star Wars creator George Lucas, and Virgin Group founder Sir Richard Branson.</p> <p>Despite the huge increase in his paper fortune Yuan, who created Zoom with the aim of \u201cmaking everyone happy\u201d, said he is trying not to get distracted by checking the stock market.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that I am 50 now. If you had asked me this question when I was 25, I would tell you, \u2018yes, we are very excited about the stock price\u2019,\u201d he said<a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/meet-eric-yuan-man-made-zoom-meetings-69859905\"> in an interview with The Associated Press, conducted over Zoom</a>.</p> <p>\u201cBut, now, seriously, I can tell you the truth, it don\u2019t matter. So the stock is up, it\u2019s good for our investors. If it\u2019s down, we keep working hard. I really do not focus on the stock price.\u201d</p> <p>Yuan first came up with his idea for video-conferencing while at university in China in the 1990s, when he would travel by train for 10 hours to see his then-girlfriend, now his wife. \u201cI detested those rides,\u201d he told <a href=\"https://medium.com/thrive-global/the-inspiring-backstory-of-eric-s-yuan-founder-and-ceo-of-zoom-98b7fab8cacc\">Thrive Global</a>, \u201cI used to imagine other ways I could visit my girlfriend without travelling \u2014 those daydreams eventually became the basis for Zoom.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yuan set his heart on moving to the US after watching a video of a Bill Gates speech about the transformational power of the internet. He said he knew the internet would be \u201cthe wave of the future\u201d and he wanted to be in the \u201cred hot\u201d centre of it in Silicon Valley.</p> <p>Initially his visa application was rejected, but \u201cI continued to apply again and again over the course of two years and finally received my visa on the ninth try\u201d, he said.</p> <p>After more than a decade working on video-conferencing technology at Cisco Webex, Yuan became frustrated and decided to strike out on his own. \u201cI firmly believed I could develop a platform that would make customers happy,\u201d he said. \u201cSo in June of 2011, I decided it was time to make the video communications solution I imagined during my college train trips a reality.\u201d More than 40 Cisco engineers followed him to Zoom.</p> <p>Yuan said Zoom was not designed with home schooling or kids\u2019 birthday parties in mind, but is delighted that his app can bring young people some joy in the lockdown. \u201cKids are pretty smart, they always figure out new use cases,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are some very cool consumer use cases.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>While the Covid-19 pandemic has made him and his investors very rich, like everyone else, Yuan cannot wait for the crisis to be over. But he hopes that bosses will learn that employees can work just as well from home as they can in the office.</p> <p>\u201cI hope this crisis can be over very, very soon, but one thing I know for sure is that companies will learn this is the way to work,\u201d he said. \u201cI am pretty sure almost every company will be thinking about it and [will] say, \u2018hey, maybe working from home makes sense\u2019, and maybe let every employee work from home, maybe once a week.

We refresh the news not because of a civic sense that following the news is important, but because so much may have happened since the last refresh. These developments are coming so fast that it\u2019s hard to remember just how radical they are.</p> \n<p>Cast your mind back a few weeks and imagine someone telling you the following: within a month, schools will be closed. Almost all public gatherings will be cancelled. Hundreds of millions of people around the world will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/26/us-unemployment-rate-coronavirus-business\" title=\"\">out of work</a>. Governments will be throwing together some of the largest economic stimulus packages in history. In certain places, landlords will not be collecting rent, or banks collecting mortgage payments, and the homeless will be allowed to stay <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/21/uk-hotels-homeless-shelters-coronavirus\" title=\"\">in hotels</a> free of charge. Experiments will be underway in the direct government provision of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/universal-basic-income\" title=\"\">basic income</a>. Large swathes of the world will be collaborating \u2013 with various degrees of coercion and nudging \u2013 on a shared project of keeping at least two metres between each other whenever possible. Would you have believed what you were hearing?</p> \n<p>It\u2019s not just the size and speed of what is happening that\u2019s dizzying. It\u2019s the fact that we have grown accustomed to hearing that democracies are incapable of making big moves like this quickly, or at all. But here we are. Any glance at history reveals that crises and disasters have continually set the stage for change, often for the better. The global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/06/worst-case-thinking-prevent-pandemics-coronavirus-existential-risk\" title=\"\">flu epidemic of 1918</a> helped create national health services in many European countries. The twinned crises of the Great Depression and the second world war set the stage for the modern welfare state.</p> \n<p>But crises can also send societies down darker paths. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, government surveillance of citizens exploded, while George W Bush launched new wars that stretched into indefinite occupations. (As I write this, the US military\u2019s current attempt at reducing its troop presence in Afghanistan, 19 years after the invasion, is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/world/asia/coronavirus-withdrawal-afghanistan.html\" title=\"\">being slowed</a> by coronavirus-related complications.) Another recent crisis, the 2008 financial crash, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/24/coronavirus-crisis-change-world-financial-global-capitalism\" title=\"\">resolved</a> in a way that meant banks and financial institutions were restored to pre-crash normality, at great public cost, while government spending on public services across the world was slashed.</p> \n<p>Because crises shape history, there are hundreds of thinkers who have devoted their lives to studying how they unfold. This work \u2013 what we might call the field of \u201ccrisis studies\u201d \u2013 charts how, whenever crisis visits a given community, the fundamental reality of that community is laid bare. Who has more and who has less. Where the power lies. What people treasure and what they fear.</p> \n<p>In such moments, whatever is broken in society gets revealed for just how broken it is, often in the form of haunting little images or stories. In recent weeks, the news has furnished us with countless examples. Airlines are flying large numbers of empty or near-<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/10/eu-airlines-ghost-flights-coronavirus-fightback-airport-landing-rules-empty-planes\" title=\"\">empty flights</a> for the sole purpose of protecting their slots on prime sky routes. There have been <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20200321-french-police-accused-of-fining-homeless-people-amid-virus-lockdown\" title=\"\">reports</a> of French police fining homeless people for being outside during the lockdown. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/09/new-york-is-making-hand-sanitizer-with-prison-labor.html\" title=\"\">Prisoners</a> in New York state are getting paid less than a dollar per hour to bottle hand sanitiser that they themselves are not allowed to use (because it contains alcohol), in a prison where they are not given free soap, but must buy it in an on-site shop.</p> \n<p>But disasters and emergencies do not just throw light on the world as it is. They also rip open the fabric of normality. Through the hole that opens up, we glimpse possibilities of other worlds. Some thinkers who study disasters focus more on all that might go wrong. Others are more optimistic, framing crises not just in terms of what is lost but also what might be gained. Every disaster is different, of course, and it\u2019s never just one or the other: loss and gain always coexist. Only in hindsight will the contours of the new world we\u2019re entering become clear. </p> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<p>The pessimistic view is that a crisis makes bad things worse. People who study disasters \u2013 and especially pandemics \u2013 know all too well their tendency to inflame xenophobia and racial scapegoating. When the Black Death came to Europe in the 14th century, cities and towns shut themselves to outsiders \u2013 and assaulted, banished and killed \u201cundesirable\u201d community members, most often Jews. In 1858, a mob in New York City broke into a quarantine hospital for immigrants on Staten Island, demanded that everyone leave and then burned the hospital down, fearful that it was putting people outside at risk of yellow fever. Wikipedia now has a page collating examples from more than 35 countries of \u201cxenophobia and racism related to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic\u201d: they range from taunts to outright assault.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn a totally rational world, you might assume that an international pandemic would lead to greater internationalism,\u201d says the historian Mike Davis, a renowned American chronicler of the disasters incubated by globalisation. For Davis, who wrote <a href=\"https://thenewpress.com/books/monster-our-door\" title=\"\">a book</a> about the threat of avian flu in 2005, pandemics are a perfect example of the kind of crises to which global capitalism (with its constant movement of people and goods) is particularly vulnerable, but that the capitalist mindset (with its inability to think in terms beyond profit) cannot address. \u201cIn a rational world, we would be ramping up production of basic essential supplies \u2013 test kits, masks, respirators \u2013 not only for our own use, but for poorer countries, too. Because it\u2019s all one battle. But it\u2019s not necessarily a rational world. So there could be a lot of demonisation and calls for isolation. Which will mean more deaths and more suffering worldwide.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the US, President Trump has tried hard <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/trump-calls-covid-19-the-chinese-virus-as-rift-with-coronavirus-beijing-escalates\" title=\"\">to brand</a> the new coronavirus as inherently \u201cChinese\u201d, and to use the pandemic as a pretext for tightening borders and accepting fewer asylum seekers. Republican officials, thinktanks and media outlets have <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/republican-xenophobia-coronavirus-pandemic/\" title=\"\">claimed or implied</a> that Covid-19 is a man-made Chinese bioweapon. Some Chinese officials, in turn, have pushed the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/world/asia/coronavirus-china-conspiracy-theory.html\" title=\"\">conspiracy theory</a> that the outbreak came to China by way of American soldiers. In Europe, the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, recently announced: \u201cWe are fighting a two-front war: one front is called migration, and the other one belongs to the coronavirus. There is a logical connection between the two, as both spread with movement.\u201d</p> \n<p>When you\u2019re fighting a war, you want to know as much about the enemy as possible. But it\u2019s easy, in the rush of crisis, to put in place surveillance tools without thinking about the long-term harm they might do. The scholar Shoshana Zuboff, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/02/age-of-surveillance-capitalism-shoshana-zuboff-review\" title=\"\">author of</a> The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, reminded me that, prior to 9/11, the US government had been in the process of developing serious regulations designed to give web users real choice about how their personal information was and wasn\u2019t used. \u201cIn the course of a few days,\u201d Zuboff says, \u201cthe concern shifted from \u2018How do we regulate these companies that are violating privacy norms and rights\u2019 to \u2018How do we nurture and protect these companies so they can collect data for us?\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>For governments looking to monitor their citizens even more closely, and companies looking to get rich by doing the same, it would be hard to imagine a more perfect crisis than a global pandemic. In China today, drones search for people without facemasks; when they are found, the drones\u2019 built-in speakers <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/01/coronavirus-watch-drones-scold-maskless-civilians-in-china.html\" title=\"\">broadcast scoldings</a> from police.

South Korea <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/06/more-scary-than-coronavirus-south-koreas-health-alerts-expose-private-lives\" title=\"\">sends texts</a> to the public identifying potentially infected individuals and sharing information about where they\u2019ve been.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"27c023bee9485657cde9d35b2dd69e5fe4e098d0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27c023bee9485657cde9d35b2dd69e5fe4e098d0/0_0_3664_2608/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nathalie Lees\" width=\"1000\" height=\"712\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>Not all surveillance is inherently malign, and new tech tools very well might end up playing a role in fighting the virus, but Zuboff worries that these emergency measures will become permanent, so enmeshed in daily life that we forget their original purpose. Lockdowns have made many of us, sitting at home glued to our computers and phones, more dependent than ever on big tech companies. Many of these same companies are actively pitching themselves to government as a vital part of the solution. It is worth asking what they stand to gain. \u201cPeople have a hard time remembering privacy rights when they\u2019re trying to deal with something like a pandemic,\u201d says Vasuki Shastry, a Chatham House fellow who studies the interplay of technology and democracy. \u201cOnce a system gets scaled up, it can be very difficult to scale it back down. And then maybe it takes on other uses.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the space of a few weeks, the prime ministers of both Israel and Hungary have effectively been given the power to rule by decree, without interference from courts or legislature. Meanwhile, the UK\u2019s recently rolled-out coronavirus bill <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/coronavirus-suspects-may-be-detained-under-uk-emergency-powers\" title=\"\">gives police</a> and immigration officers the authority \u2013 in place for the next two years \u2013 to arrest and detain people suspected of carrying the virus, so that they can be tested. The US Department of Justice has, since the outbreak began, filed <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/doj-suspend-constitutional-rights-coronavirus-970935/\" title=\"\">a request</a> with Congress for a new rule that would allow judges to suspend courtroom proceedings in emergencies, creating the possibility of people being jailed without ever being able to formally object. \u201cThose of us who follow the police know how this goes,\u201d said Kevin Blowe of Netpol, a UK group focused on protest rights. \u201cThese powers get put in place, and it sounds reasonable enough at the time \u2013 and then very quickly they\u2019re applied for other purposes that have nothing to do with democracy and nothing to do with public safety.\u201d</p> \n<p>In a 2008 <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/report/pandemic-preparedness-need-public-health-not-law-enforcementnational-security-approach?redirect=cpredirect/33642\" title=\"\">report</a> on the legal aspects of pandemic response, prompted by the increase in pandemic flu outbreaks, a team of historians and medical ethicists assembled by the American Civil Liberties Union bemoaned a common tendency \u2013 resurgent, in their view, since 9/11 \u2013 for government to address public health problems using mindsets more appropriate to tracking down criminals. This suspicious mindset, they argued, ended up most affecting racial minorities and the poor. Tactics like these can make fighting the disease harder, by driving a hard wedge of distrust between government and citizens. As the report put it: \u201cPeople, rather than the disease, become the enemy.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"4af07576-d7aa-4d4c-98dc-13da3ec13aef\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RnTfvrhJs88?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<p>There\u2019s another school of thought that looks at crisis and sees glimmers of possibility. For thinkers in this camp, the example of the 2008 financial crash looms large. But where, from their view, 2008 led to defeat \u2013 with the broad public giving up a great deal while a small few profited \u2013 Covid-19 might open the door to political progress<strong>.</strong></p> \n<p>\u201cI think we\u2019re just so different to how we were before we saw the aftermath of the 2008 crash,\u201d said the American writer Rebecca Solnit, one of today\u2019s most eloquent investigators of crises and their implications. \u201cIdeas that used to be seen as leftwing seem more reasonable to more people. There\u2019s room for change that there wasn\u2019t beforehand. It\u2019s an opening.\u201d</p> \n<p>The argument, in its simplest form, is this: Covid-19 has revealed the political status quo to be broken. Long before anyone had heard of the new coronavirus, people died of diseases we knew how to prevent and treat. People lived precarious lives in societies awash with wealth. Experts told us about catastrophic threats on the horizon, including pandemics, and we did next to nothing to prepare for them. At the same time, the drastic measures governments have taken in recent weeks testify to just how much power the state <em>does</em> have \u2013 the extent of what government can accomplish (and quickly!) when it realises it must act boldly or risk being seen as fundamentally illegitimate. As Pankaj Mishra <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-17/coronavirus-will-revive-an-all-powerful-state\" title=\"\">recently wrote</a>: \u201cIt has taken a disaster for the state to assume its original responsibility to protect citizens.\u201d</p> \n<p>For years, in mainstream politics the conventional line \u2013 on everything from healthcare to basic living expenses such as housing \u2013 has been that even if the world has its problems, expansive government intervention is not a feasible solution. Instead, we have been told that what works best are \u201cmarketplace\u201d solutions, which give large roles to corporations motivated not by outdated notions like \u201cthe public good\u201d but by a desire to make a profit. But then the virus started spreading, governments spent trillions in days \u2013 even going so far as to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/coronavirus-us-bailout-what-you-need-to-know\" title=\"\">write cheques</a> directly to citizens \u2013 and suddenly the question of what was feasible felt different.</p> \n<p>From this perspective, the task today is not to fight the virus in order to return to business as usual, because business as usual was already a disaster. The goal, instead, is to fight the virus \u2013 and in doing so transform business as usual into something more humane and secure.</p> \n<p>In her 2009 book, A Paradise Built in Hell<em>,</em> Solnit used case studies of disasters \u2013 including the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, the 2001 terror attacks and Hurricane Katrina \u2013 to argue that emergencies aren\u2019t just moments when bad things get worse, or when people inevitably become more scared, suspicious and self-centred. Instead she foregrounded the ways in which disasters opened up human reserves of improvisation, solidarity and resolve, pockets of purpose and joy, even in the midst of loss and pain. The book was not a call to celebrate disaster \u2013 but to pay attention to the possibilities it might contain, and how it might shake us loose from old ways. In Solnit\u2019s telling, \u201cofficial\u201d disaster responses had a tendency to muck things up by treating people as part of the problem to be managed, not an invaluable part of the solution.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\" no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Sometimes this mismanagement is a result of mere incompetence \u2013 other times it is more sinister. In her 2007 book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/sep/15/politics\" title=\"\">The Shock Doctrine</a>, the Canadian writer Naomi Klein laid out a dark account of crisis politics. In Klein\u2019s view, there is always Disaster 1 \u2013 the earthquake, the storm, the military conflict, the economic slump \u2013 and Disaster 2 \u2013 the bad things that people with power subsequently get up to, such as ramming through extreme economic reforms or gobbling up post-crisis opportunities for self-enrichment, while the rest of us are too dazed to notice. (In fact, Klein argued, these people sometimes engineer Disaster 1 to get the process started.)</p> \n<p>Unlike Solnit\u2019s book, The Shock Doctrine doesn\u2019t have much to say about the resilience of everyday people when everything goes horribly wrong. (Indeed, Solnit directly criticised Klein for this omission.) But the two books fit together like puzzle pieces. Both address crisis not in terms of what inevitably \u2013 or \u201cnaturally\u201d \u2013 happens as they unfold, but in terms of choices that people make along the way. And both were well-timed to contribute to the political conversations taking shape in the rubble of the financial crash.</p> \n<p>In 2008, days after Barack Obama\u2019s election, his chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, famously said: \u201cYou never want a serious crisis to go to waste.\u201d Today\u2019s leftists, for whom Obama mostly represents disappointment, are prone to agree. They feel that, in the wake of recent crises, they lost, and now is the time to make amends. If, facing a pandemic, we can change this much in a few weeks, then how much might we change in a year?</p> \n<p>For anyone making this argument, the contrast between 2008 and the present crisis is striking. Compared to the opaque financial crisis, with its credit default swaps and collateralised debt obligations, the coronavirus is relatively easy to understand. It is a dozen crises tangled into one, and they\u2019re all unfolding immediately, in ways that cannot be missed. Politicians are getting infected. Wealthy celebrities are getting infected. Your friends and relatives are getting infected. We may not quite all be \u201cin it together\u201d \u2013 as always, the poor are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/14/coronavirus-outbreak-inequality-austerity-pandemic\" title=\"\">hit worse</a> \u2013 but there is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/29/coronavirus-means-we-really-are-finally-all-in-this-together\" title=\"\">more truth</a> to the idea than there ever was in the wake of 2008.</p> \n<p>In this, the optimists believe, there is hope that we might begin to see the world differently. Maybe we can view our problems as shared, and society as more than just a mass of individuals competing against each other for wealth and standing. Maybe, in short, we can understand that the logic of the market should not dominate as many spheres of human existence as we currently allow it to.</p> \n<p>\u201cMore people are in a position to connect the dots,\u201d Klein said. \u201cIt has to do with people\u2019s experiences; for people of a certain age, their only experience of capitalism has been one of crisis. And they want things to be different.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<p>That screaming buzzsaw noise in the background of this conversation is the sound of the climate crisis. If 2008 is the disaster that Klein and like-minded thinkers want to avoid repeating, climate change is the much bigger disaster they see coming \u2013 that they know is already here \u2013 and that they want to fight off. Indeed, in the years since publishing The Shock Doctrine, Klein has made climate change her central focus, framing it as the paradigmatic emergency that must be wrenched from the clutches of fossil-fuel profiteers and their enablers in government.</p> \n<p>Although Covid-19 is likely the biggest global crisis since the second world war, it is still dwarfed in the long term by climate change. Yet the two problems have suggestive similarities. Both will require unusual levels of global cooperation. Both demand changes in behaviour today in the name of reducing suffering tomorrow. Both problems were long predicted with great certainty by scientists, and have been neglected by governments unable to see beyond the next fiscal quarter\u2019s growth statistics. Accordingly, both will require governments to take drastic action and banish the logic of the marketplace from certain realms of human activity, while simultaneously embracing public investment. In other words, to think of this new level of state intervention as a temporary requirement is to ensure that we continue barrelling down the path to climate disaster.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying for years to get people out of normal mode and into emergency mode,\u201d said Margaret Klein Salamon, a former psychologist who now heads the advocacy group The Climate Mobilization. \u201cWhat is possible politically is fundamentally different when lots of people get into emergency mode \u2013 when they fundamentally accept that there\u2019s danger, and that if we want to be safe we need to do everything we can. And it\u2019s been interesting to see that theory validated by the response to the coronavirus. Now the challenge is to keep emergency mode activated about climate, where the dangers are orders of magnitude greater. We can\u2019t think we\u2019re going to go \u2018back to normal\u2019, because things weren\u2019t normal.\u201d</p> \n<p>The analogy between the two crises only goes so far. There is no getting around the fact that the impacts of climate change are more gradual than those of Covid-19. Most people do not feel they or their loved ones could die from the climate crisis this month, and so emergency mode is harder to activate and sustain. As Salamon pointed out to me, if we truly accepted we were in a climate emergency, then every day the news would lead with updates about which countries were reducing their emissions the fastest, and people would be clamouring to make sure their leaders were adopting the policies that worked.</p> \n<p>But it is not unimaginable that the experience of Covid-19 could help us understand climate change differently. As the virus has reduced industrial activity and road traffic, air pollution has plummeted. In early March, the Stanford University scientist Marshall Burke <a href=\"http://www.g-feed.com/2020/03/covid-19-reduces-economic-activity.html\" title=\"\">used pollution data</a> from four Chinese cities to measure changes in the level of PM2.5, a particularly harmful pollutant that attacks the heart and lungs. He estimated that, in China alone, emission reductions since the start of the pandemic had in effect saved the lives of at least 1,400 children under five and 51,700 adults over 70. Meanwhile, people around the world have been sharing their own anecdotal findings online \u2013 stories of sweet-smelling breezes, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/philipoltermann/status/1244189207867854848\" title=\"\">expanded</a> bike lanes and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/29/uk-wildlife-enjoys-humans-lockdown-but-concerns-raised-over-conservation\" title=\"\">birdsong returning</a> to neighbourhoods \u2013 in a way that almost resembles a digitally distributed Rebecca Solnit project: people catching glimpses, in the midst of a disaster, of a future they know they want and need.</p> \n<p>Alongside these hopeful signs, a far less heartening story is unfolding, which fits Klein\u2019s \u201cshock doctrine\u201d framework. Disaster 1: Covid-19. Disaster 2: the dismantling of even the meagre existing rules designed to protect the environment. On 26 March, following lobbying from the energy industry, the US Environmental Protection Agency <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/27/trump-pollution-laws-epa-allows-companies-pollute-without-penalty-during-coronavirus\" title=\"\">announced that</a>, in recognition of the pandemic\u2019s effects on the workforce, it will not punish violations of pollution regulations so long as companies can link those violations to the pandemic. China\u2019s environmental ministry has started <a href=\"https://news.bloombergenvironment.com/environment-and-energy/china-relaxes-environmental-rules-to-curb-viruss-economic-hit\" title=\"\">waiving inspections</a> that assess the environmental impact of industrial facilities. And advocacy groups funded by the plastics industry have launched a <a href=\"https://heated.world/p/the-right-is-using-covid-19-to-wage?fbclid=IwAR3v3a7oV_CSeQE448S_fMVv-CpVBTst75tAiHD7HDKUIOSi_ugkikxR6nQ\" title=\"\">public relations blitz</a> on behalf of single-use plastic bags, spreading the unproven claim that the virus is less likely to stick to plastic than to the cloth fabric of reusable bags. Looking back at the crisis of 2008, we can see that emissions dropped then, too \u2013 only to rebound drastically in 2010 and 2011.</p> \n<p>Salamon believes that one lesson of the coronavirus crisis is the power of shared emotion, which has helped make possible radical action to slow the pandemic. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about people giving each other medical expertise. I\u2019m talking about people calling each other up and saying: \u2018How are you doing? Are you scared? I\u2019m scared. I want you to be OK, I want us to be OK.\u2019 And that\u2019s what we want for climate, too. We need to learn to be scared together, to agree on what we\u2019re terrified about.\u201d Only then, she said, would governments be forced to act. \u201cIt\u2019s good that we\u2019re entering emergency mode about the pandemic,\u201d she said. \u201cBut unless we also do it for climate \u2026 \u201d She didn\u2019t finish the sentence.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>What kind of actions would it take for the optimists\u2019 vision to materialise? The historian Philip Mirowski, author of <a href=\"https://www.versobooks.com/books/1613-never-let-a-serious-crisis-go-to-waste\" title=\"\">Never Let a Serious Crisis Go to Waste</a>: How Neoliberalism Survived the Financial Meltdown, warns against complacency. \u201cThe left thought it was so obvious to everyone that the crisis revealed the utter bankruptcy of a certain way of looking at the economy,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t obvious to everyone, and the left lost.\u201d How do we prevent the world from going back to a version of the way it was before Covid-19, with the virus vanquished but all of the old ongoing disasters still unfolding?</p> \n<p>\u201cThe political outcome of the epidemic,\u201d said Mike Davis, \u201cwill, like all political outcomes, be decided by struggle, by battles over interpretation, by pointing out what causes problems and what solves them. And we need to get that analysis out in the world any way we can.\u201d One major obstacle, of course, is social distancing, which certainly hinders many time-tested methods of waging such struggles, such as political canvassing and street protest. \u201cThe biggest risk for all of us,\u201d said Klein, \u201cis going to be frittering away this time sitting at home on our social media feeds, living the extremely limited forms of politics that get enabled there.\u201d</p> \n<p>Davis hoped protesters would find their way into the streets sooner rather than later, and speculated that a street action with all the sign-holding participants spaced 10 or 15 feet apart would make a dramatic media image. He lives in San Diego, and as our conversation wrapped up, he mentioned that he was planning to spend part of the afternoon doing his part by standing by himself on a street corner, holding a sign. He hadn\u2019t decided what to write on it yet, but was thinking about \u201cSUPPORT THE NURSES\u2019 UNION\u201d or \u201cDEMAND PAID SICK LEAVE\u201d.</p> \n<p>Solnit told me she was taking heart from all the new ways people were finding to connect and help each other around the world, ranging from the neighbourhood delivery networks that had sprung up to bring groceries to people who couldn\u2019t get out, to more symbolic interventions, such as kids playing music on an older neighbour\u2019s porch. The Italian political scientist Alessandro Delfanti said he was finding hope from a post-outbreak <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/staten-island-amazon-warehouse-workers-strike-coronavirus-2020-3?r=US&amp;IR=T\" title=\"\">wave of strikes</a> roiling Amazon warehouses in the US and Europe, and also the steps that workers across different sectors of the Italian economy were taking to help each other secure equipment they needed to stay safe.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/inside-the-race-to-develop-a-coronavirus-vaccine-covid-19\">'It\u2019s a razor\u2019s edge we\u2019re walking': inside the race to develop a coronavirus vaccine</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>What happens next might depend on the optimists\u2019 ability to transport such moments of solidarity into the broader political sphere, arguing that it makes no sense to address Covid-19 without at least trying to fix everything else, too, creating a world where our shared resources do more for more people. \u201cWe don\u2019t even have a language for this emotion, in which the wonderful comes wrapped in the terrible, joy in sorrow, courage in fear,\u201d wrote Solnit in A Paradise Built in Hell. \u201cWe cannot welcome disaster, but we can value the responses, both practical and psychological.\u201d </p> \n<p>The world feels awfully strange right now, but not because \u2013 or not <em>just</em> because \u2013 it is changing so fast and any one of us could fall ill at any time, or could already be carrying the virus and not know it.

People used wine or champagne bottles as weights and tagged Dooley in their videos. There\u2019s an optional donation via PayPal, and the most generous donor wins some kind of 80s-style merch chucked in by a small business that in turn gets a plug.</p> \n<p>In a way, being forced online \u2013 using Instagram Live \u2013 was fortuitous. \u201cPeople have been begging for Retrosweat to be online and I\u2019d already been writing the pilot and trying to get funding,\u201d Dooley says. \u201cI wanted to create something quite cinematic and beautiful, like a variety show.
