How much worse the situation is compared with the usual numbers of people who die in normal circumstances has been a subject of some debate in some sections of the media, and particularly on social media. </p> \n  <p>A blogpost by David Shaw, a senior research fellow at the Institute for Biomedical Ethics, University of Basel, posted on the British Medical Journal provides some much-needed context. Shaw identifies four important contextual factors that should be borne in mind to understand reports of death tolls that make headlines in the daily press. For example, he writes: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>[I]n all the millions of words written about how many people have died in each country each day, no coverage appears to have given the baseline daily death rate before the outbreak began. Take Scotland: here, the death rate had averaged between 6 and 8 people per day before increasing to 16 on the 1<sup>st</sup> of April. But the <a href=\"https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files/statistics/vital-events-ref-tables/2018/vital-events-ref-tables-18-publication.pdf\">typical death rate in Scotland</a> is 160 people per day, with about a quarter of them dying of cancer. This means that the virus is currently increasing the daily rate by 10% (and before that around 5%) \u2013 a substantial increase, but not as massive as many members of the public are probably assuming, given the press coverage. Reporting the increasing number of deaths in isolation without this context is likely to increase people\u2019s stress about the virus, because people are unaware of how many people normally die each day. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><a href=\"https://blogs.bmj.com/medical-ethics/2020/04/02/the-vital-contexts-of-coronavirus/\">Read more on the BMJ website: The vital contexts of coronavirus.</a></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-07T15:45:04.925Z\">at 4.45pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8c99548f08ec70cecec420\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-07T15:18:59.356Z\">4.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>More people have now died from the coronavirus in New York City than perished in the September 11 attack on the World Trade Center, the <strong>Associated Press</strong> reports.<br></p> \n  <p> At least 3,202 people in the city have been killed by the virus, according to the latest figures released on Tuesday.

(See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/07/uk-coronavirus-live-news-boris-johnson-spends-night-in-intensive-care?page=with:block-5e8ca47b8f085d226cfd49e2#block-5e8ca47b8f085d226cfd49e2\"> 5.05pm.)</a> It is always advisable to show strong support for the boss, even if you don\u2019t particularly mean it, but in this case it seemed very obvious that Raab did. Johnson\u2019s illness has clearly shocked his colleagues, and their concern for him is genuine.</p> \n  <p>Beyond that, what was probably most interesting was what Raab had to say about the prospect of the lockdown measures being relaxed. When Johnson announced the lockdown 15 days ago, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I can assure you that we will keep these restrictions under constant review. We will look again <a>in three weeks</a>, and relax them if the evidence shows we are able to. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The three-week deadline comes up on Monday. But when Raab was asked about the prospect of the restrictions being lifted in any way next week, he very much played down the idea. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In terms of the review, we are not at that stage yet. We will take any decision when the time is right, based on the facts and the scientific and medical advice.</p> \n   <p>Our number one and overriding focus right now is on conveying the key message, which is that everyone needs to keep adhering to this guidance.</p> \n   <p>There is a long Easter bank holiday weekend coming up, warm weather and we understand people are making big sacrifices to follow this guidance. It is helping, it is contributing to our ability to tackle the coronavirus.</p> \n   <p>The worst thing now would be to take our foot off the pedal, to ease up on that and risk losing the gains that have been made.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And in another answer, Raab said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The critical thing is to take evidence-based decisions and so we\u2019ve said that we will take any review once we\u2019ve got the evidence that the measures are working and having the kind of impact taking us past the peak which means that they can be responsibly done. We\u2019re not at that stage yet.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Prof Chris Whitty</strong> was a bit more explicit. Talking about when some of the restrictions might be relaxed, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s really important that we get to the point that we\u2019re all confident that we\u2019re beyond the peak and then at that point start making it clear what combination of things, and over what period of time, seems a sensible combination to take us through.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1b91f03f-b7ca-4277-9fc2-f065733bcca9\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LmHGQxTqETE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-07T19:12:54.095Z\">at 8.12pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8caa198f08ec70cecec52c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-07T16:33:30.032Z\">5.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Q: A letter from GPs to Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer for England, suggests some people who should be shielded are not being shielded.

Large numbers of patients could be denied care, with those facing a poor prognosis losing the potentially life-saving equipment even if their condition is improving.</p> \n  <p>A strong-worded statement issued by Dr Jackie Applebee, chair of Doctor in Unite, challenged such guidance.</p> \n  <p>It said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We believe that all people are of equal value. </p> \n   <p>Intensive care will not work for some patients. Ventilator support will sometimes not succeed. Doctors must judge who is most likely to improve with these measures, and who is not.</p> \n   <p>These decisions have previously always been made on a case-by-case basis, where the risks and benefits to an individual patient are carefully considered. The arbitrary condemnation of one group or another is inexcusable. Being old, living in a care home, or having a pre-existing disability should not lead to an automatic exclusion from possible treatment. Blanket categorisation of large groups of people in such a way is prejudice. There is no place for it in the NHS.</p> \n   <p>There may come a time where our healthcare system is overwhelmed.

He was moved as a precaution so he could be close to a ventilator, but there has been no indication so far that he has been put on a ventilator \u2013 a process that would require hime being sedated. </p> \n  <p>The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, is currently standing in for Johnson and has vowed to follow set by the prime minister. </p> \n  <p>Johnson was understood to be conscious when he was moved to intensive care at about 7pm.</p> \n  <p>Derek Hill, professor of medical imaging at University College London , said the PM could be given a breathing aid known as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) which bridges the gap between an oxygen mask and full ventilation.</p> \n  <p>CPAP uses pressure to send a blend of air and oxygen into the mouth at a steady rate, thereby boosting the amount of oxygen that enters the lungs.</p> \n  <p>But Prof Hill said many Covid-19 patients eventually \u201cprogress to invasive ventilation\u201d. This is for people whose illness is so severe they are struggling or unable to breathe for themselves.</p> \n  <p>A mechanical ventilator either does all the breathing for the patient, or assists the patient\u2019s own breathing. The patient is heavily sedated while a device called an endotracheal tube is guided through the mouth into the windpipe.</p> \n  <p>The death rate of those admitted to intensive care in the UK with Covid-19 has topped 50%, according to the latest figures.</p> \n  <p>The figure comes from data compiled by the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre based on a sample of 2,249 coronavirus patients.</p> \n  <p>The data showed of the 690 patients in the sample whose care outcomes were known, 346 - 50.1% - had died, while 344 had been discharged.</p> \n  <p>The remaining patients, 1,559, were reported still to be in critical care.<br>The data shows that of 2,248 patients, 73% were men and 27% were women.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-07T07:11:42.796Z\">at 8.11am BST</time></p> \n</div>",

  "<p>It was as a direct result of a newspaper article by the former Labour MP Joe Ashton, who has died aged 86, that a compulsory register of MPs\u2019 financial interests outside Westminster was first established by the House of Commons in 1974. Ashton had called for the creation of such a register in a column he wrote for the party newspaper, Labour Weekly, under the heading MPs for Hire, and two weeks after its publication the newly elected Labour government took the first steps to seek to control political corruption.</p> <p>The February 1974 general election had been held in the middle of a scandal involving the builder John Poulson, a man with many political contacts who had been imprisoned for using bribery to win lucrative public sector contracts. Labour had campaigned on a manifesto promising a compulsory register that might prevent a repeat, and Ashton had been prompted to write his article in April 1974 by a report in the Guardian suggesting that the new prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1995/may/25/obituaries\">Harold Wilson</a>, was preparing to resile from that commitment in favour of a regime of voluntary declarations of interest.</p> <p>Ashton was subsequently found (by a formal inquiry of the Commons\u2019 Committee of Privileges) to have committed a serious contempt of parliament for suggesting, in his article, that MPs were available for hire. He was obliged to apologise for being what he himself called \u201ca brave, mad whistleblower\u201d, yet it was because of the political uproar his column caused that Wilson was obliged to act so swiftly after his general election win.</p> <p>Ashton was a Yorkshireman who had a background of poverty and an instinctive populist sense of what mattered to his working-class constituents and to the Labour electorate. He was blessed with articulacy, had the ability to turn a colourful phrase and possessed a common touch \u2013 all attributes that took him into parliament and made him a punchy, popular newspaper columnist. He was an immensely active constituency MP for 33 years, but failed to progress at Westminster because of a lack of judgment that sometimes antagonised his parliamentary colleagues. He was also part of the unlucky generation of Labour MPs whose prime years at Westminster coincided with 18 years of uninterrupted Conservative government.</p> <p>Born in the slums of Attercliffe in Sheffield to teenage parents, Arthur (known as Ike) Ashton and Nellie (nee Maloney), Joe was named after an uncle who had been killed at the age of four by a runaway steamroller. His father was intermittently unemployed, although he did stand-in shifts at the local Nunnery pit and later found work in the city\u2019s steel industry. His mother was a \u201cbuffer girl\u201d, polishing nickel-plated silver cutlery. Joe passed the 11-plus to attend High Storrs grammar school, but never wore the uniform his family could not afford, something his parents were successfully advised to blame on the lack of clothing coupons under wartime rationing. At 16 he became an engineering apprentice at Rotherham Technical College and joined the Labour party.</p> <p>In 1954 he did two years\u2019 national service in the RAF, taking part in the ill-fated Suez invasion before returning to a white-collar job as a design engineer, a post he held until narrowly winning a difficult byelection in Bassetlaw in 1968. The constituency, situated in the Nottinghamshire coalfield, was at the time facing pit closures imposed by an unpopular Labour government, and Ashton\u2019s majority was reduced to 1.72%. A traditionally safe Labour \u201cred wall\u201d seat until lost to the Conservatives in December 2019, it was held by Ashton with a 36.4% majority at his last election in 1997.</p> <p>He learned politics as a shop steward and as a member of Sheffield city council from 1962 until 1969. When first elected, he was the youngest member of the council, succeeding Roy Hattersley in that distinction. Hattersley would later write, in an affectionate and forthright foreword to Ashton\u2019s first book of memoirs, Red Rose Blues (2000), that what he most admired about the author was his \u201cabsolute lack of discretion\u201d and his inability ever to moderate his support or antagonism for any cause.</p> <p>Such full-hearted enthusiasm was immediately evident at Westminster, where Ashton busily embarked on various backbench campaigns and established a high public profile as a national newspaper columnist, including briefly for the Guardian. He was parliamentary private secretary (PPS) to the sports minister Denis Howell (1969-70) and after Labour\u2019s return to government did the same job for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/14/tony-benn-obituary\">Tony Benn</a> as secretary of state for industry and then energy. He was a strong leftwing supporter of Benn, encouraging him to fight Wilson as prime minister \u2013 \u201cget into the ring like Cassius Clay and knock him out,\u201d he advised Benn in 1975 \u2013 and although he was sacked as PPS for rebelling against the government in early 1976 he continued to do the job informally. He ran Benn\u2019s campaign for the Labour leadership when Wilson unexpectedly resigned in the spring of 1976, and was surprised to be appointed as an assistant whip by the new prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/mar/28/guardianobituaries.politics\">James Callaghan</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ab705d4697e4d4f9812da0d2c081582104bf2f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ab705d4697e4d4f9812da0d2c081582104bf2f9/31_61_4594_2757/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Ashton with the cast of his play A Majority of One, 1981.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Ashton with the cast of his play A Majority of One, 1981.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pete Lomas/ANL/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He lasted only a year in the whips\u2019 office, but it was sufficient to provide material for a stage play based on the knife-edge existence of the Callaghan government. The play, A Majority of One, was well received after performances in Oldham and Nottingham in 1981; Ashton was fond of claiming that it was the inspiration for James Graham\u2019s This House at the National Theatre 30 years later. During this period he published a political novel, Grass Roots (1977), which also garnered good reviews.</p> <p>He fell out with Benn over the latter\u2019s campaigns to introduce internal constitutional reforms within the Labour party, and thereafter became increasingly antagonistic both towards Benn and the party\u2019s leftwing. He told a fellow Labour whip that he had explained to Benn: \u201cThe trouble with you, Tony, is you think the working class are noble savages when in fact there are just as many shits among the working class as anywhere else.\u201d He criticised plans for mandatory reselection of MPs at successive party conferences and was slow-handclapped in 1980 when he warned that reselection could hasten defections to a breakaway party, as indeed happened when the SDP was launched the following year.</p> <p>Ashton spent two years on the opposition frontbench as an energy spokesman from 1979. Thereafter he returned to the backbenches and sat on various select committees: trade and industry (1987-92), home affairs (1989-92), national heritage (1992-97) and on the select committee charged with modernising the House of Commons (1997-98). He chaired the all-party football committee from 1992 until he retired at the 2001 election, and was a passionate supporter of Sheffield Wednesday football club, of which he was a director from 1990 to 1999.</p> <p>In 1998 Ashton was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/mar/16/michaelwhite\">on the premises of a Thai massage parlour</a> in Northampton during a police raid for suspected immigration offences. The following year it was disclosed that he had been questioned by police, although he had committed no offence. He wrote later in his memoirs that he had acted on a \u201ccrazy impulse\u201d. The chapter was entitled All Political Careers End in Tears. In retirement he founded the Association for Former Members of Parliament in 2001. He also published a second book of Sheffield memoirs, Joe Blow \u2013 his childhood nickname \u2013 in 2014, and donated the proceeds to the Salvation Army. He was appointed OBE in 2007.</p> <p>He married Margaret (Maggie) Lee, a former secretary at the Sheffield Brightside and Carbrook Co-operative Society coal depot, in 1957. She died in 2014 and he is survived by their daughter, Lucy.</p> <p>\u2022 Joseph William Ashton, politician, born 9 October 1933; died 30 March 2020</p>",

  "<h2>Stephen Colbert</h2> <p>It\u2019s week four of the pandemic shutdown in the US, said Stephen Colbert on Monday night\u2019s \u201cA Late Show\u201d from his home in New Jersey, and \u201cgovernment officials and health experts are warning that this is going to be the toughest week yet of the coronavirus. A lot of Americans are going to get this, and some of them are going to die. And I hope you know that you and your families are in our thoughts, and if you want them, you\u2019re in my prayers,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cBut I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s not why you tuned in tonight \u2013 you\u2019re here for the jokes.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAW3qHG4_ZY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LAW3qHG4_ZY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cSo, here we go,\u201d he said, diving into a monologue on Trump\u2019s delusional optimism, though Colbert was slightly less rosy on how America is doing; after months of advising Americans not to wear masks, the CDC announced this weekend that all Americans should wear cloth or fabric face coverings when they go out in public. \u201cWe were supposed to be covering our faces this whole time? Oh my God, Billy Porter tried to warn us!\u201d Colbert said, referencing Porter\u2019s infamous retractable face shield at the 2020 Grammys.</p> <p>\u201cGiven the sudden reversal, this new guidance is a little confusing, but on Friday, the president used his daily briefing to make it even more confusing,\u201d Colbert continued. At a press briefing, Trump called the CDC recommendation \u201cvoluntary\u201d and said that he wouldn\u2019t follow it because he didn\u2019t want to wear a mask. \u201cWell of course Trump is the guy who says he doesn\u2019t want to wear protection,\u201d said Colbert, imitating Trump: \u201cMasks are just the condom of the face \u2013 it kills all the feeling. I mean, there\u2019s a reason I don\u2019t wear a raincoat in the shower or a condom during sex.\u201d</p> <h2>Seth Meyers</h2> <p>On Late Night, Seth Meyers turned his Closer Look segment on Trump\u2019s erroneous and irresponsible claims over the past month that the coronavirus would just disappear with warmer weather in April. Asked about this baseless talking point this weekend, in April, Trump dialed down, telling reporters: \u201cI didn\u2019t say a date, I said it\u2019s going away, and it is going away.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TX4fW1dD4E\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2TX4fW1dD4E?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cAh, very clever,\u201d Meyers responded. \u201cAfter all, April has 24 days left, and it\u2019s down to, what, I don\u2019t know, 337,000 cases?\u201d Meyers said. (That number has, of course, gone up.) \u201cAnd you did \u2013 you literally said \u2018it goes away in April.\u2019 That\u2019s as close to specific as Trump ever gets. Usually, when you ask him a question, he waves it away like a dad promising his kids a trip to Disneyland while watching football.\u201d</p> <p>Meyers also criticized Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, for his mishandling of the federal stockpile of ventilators. Meyers described Kushner as \u201ceverybody\u2019s favorite botoxed nine-year-old\u201d, and \u201cthe real-life Jack Skellington, the fellow who\u2019s always lurking in the background of every White House photo like a stalker who suddenly appears in the mirror when you close your medicine cabinet.

It\u2019s not supposed to be states\u2019 stockpiles that they then use.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat makes sense,\u201d Meyers deadpanned of Kushner\u2019s argument. \u201cIt\u2019s like my doorman told me: \u2018The front door belongs to the building. If you wanna go to work so bad, climb down the fire escape.\u2019 Seriously, it\u2019s <em>your</em> stockpile? Are you writing your name on them like you\u2019re leaving your lunch in the office fridge?</p> <p>\u201cThis sniveling weasel thinks everything belongs to him because he was born into a rich family, just like his father-in-law,\u201d Meyer continued. \u201cI\u2019m shocked we haven\u2019t seen something called a Kushni-lator pop up on Craigslist.\u201d</p> <p>It all leads to one conclusion, according to Meyers: \u201cOne lesson we\u2019re all learning from this is that, generally speaking, it\u2019s better to not be governed by sociopaths.\u201d</p> <h2>Trevor Noah</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1247345214978772996\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Would Trump be more open to wearing a mask if we told him it\u2019s a border wall for your face? <a href=\"https://t.co/DymBKHyhf7\">pic.twitter.com/DymBKHyhf7</a></p>&mdash; The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1247345214978772996?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 7, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>On the Daily Social Distancing Show, Trevor Noah addressed Trump\u2019s unproven and dangerous claim that hydroxychloroquine could treat coronavirus. \u201cHere\u2019s what I don\u2019t get: Trump is acknowledging he\u2019s not a doctor, while legitimate doctors who could answer these questions are standing right there next to him,\u201d Noah said. \u201cWhy are we getting his opinion at all?

Originally conceived in 1993 with artists Christian Boltanski and Bertrand Lavier, it allowed schools and artist-run spaces to stage museum-quality group shows, with each organisation making exhibits under instruction.</p> <p>Now Do It (Home Version) takes the work straight to the people: Ulrike Grossath commands us to \u201clean, shove under, force in, tilt, pile up, make fit\u201d our household furniture into a pile; Mona Hatoum lays out how to make a lamp from a colander; Shimabuku encourages us to make art that will be appreciated by our pets; Paul McCarthy suggests \u201cuse your penis as a paint brush\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"40ff4315aaba7d3fcc41db64c9fb145dcb838405\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40ff4315aaba7d3fcc41db64c9fb145dcb838405/0_0_3196_4660/686..jpg\" alt=\"Fresh moves \u2026 Yvonne Rainer with Trio A; her new work is called Passing and Jostling While Being Confined to a Small Apartment.\" width=\"686\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fresh moves \u2026 Yvonne Rainer with Trio A; her new work is called Passing and Jostling While Being Confined to a Small Apartment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Obrist says: \u201cIt\u2019s an outlet for experimentation, to bring art where it would not normally be. A few weeks ago, I suddenly heard about people in Italy revisiting Do It during the lockdown. The project changes as the world changes. Many of the original instructions incorporated activism \u2013 Eileen Myles produced a guide of how to run for president \u2013 or had a practical purpose. So now I\u2019ve started asking artists to make new instructions for how we can help each other in this moment.\u201d The curator says he will post these on Instagram over the next few weeks, for his 300,000 followers to undertake.</p> <p>US choreographer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/dec/24/step-by-step-yvonne-rainer\">Yvonne Rainer</a> was another artist interested in radically rethinking authorship. In 1966, she relinquished control of Trio A which features a series of easy movements without music to be performed solo, including standing on one leg, walking and toe-tapping. Rainer allowed it to be taught by anyone who had danced the work, a high-brow precursor to TikTok memes. It was in homage to that work that last week Rainer released instructions for a new performance, called <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/arts/dance/yvonne-rainer-do-it-yourself-coronavirus.html\">Passing and Jostling While Being Confined to a Small Apartment</a>.</p> <p>If Rainer\u2019s intention was to stave off the claustrophobia of self-isolation, then Bruce Nauman\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artwork/bruce-nauman-body-pressure\">Body Pressure</a> \u2013 a set of typed instructions originally produced in 1974 \u2013 only compounds it. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/bruce-nauman\">Nauman</a> encourages us to press the front of our body against a wall, as hard as possible, all the time imagining that, on the other side of the bricks, we ourselves are pushing the other way with the back of the body. This, he warns, may \u201cbecome a very erotic exercise\u201d.

  "<p>An eerie mechanical hum has joined the usual backdrop of tweeting birds and the roar of the North Circular at Wanstead Flats in London. The sound is coming from behind a large wooden fence, recently erected on wide open fields by Epping Forest, where a group of long, white marquees poke up above the tree line.

There was no plan for such a crisis, so each region is responding according to what facilities and spaces are available. In Devon, refrigerated lorries have been <a href=\"https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/temporary-morgue-set-up-south-4009525\">set up on an empty lot close to Torbay </a><a href=\"https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/temporary-morgue-set-up-south-4009525\">hospital</a>.

It is an Olympian effort of scaffolding, marquees, inflatable tents and portable cabins, as existing buildings have been repurposed in a matter of days. With construction having to begin before plans were finalised in many cases, architects, engineers and fabricators are responding at a speed that leaves time for no more than basic essentials. This is emergency architecture at its most elemental.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"24c5c3e9a8fd2cd56b2a1abf9703c144d235f733\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24c5c3e9a8fd2cd56b2a1abf9703c144d235f733/97_213_3280_1969/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Workers outside a hangar at Birmingham airport, which is being converted into a large morgue.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Workers outside a hangar at Birmingham airport, which is being converted into a large morgue.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacob King/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Portakabin, the York-based firm that has been synonymous with prefab buildings for 60 years, has been at the frontline since mid-February, delivering many of the emergency structures. They began by erecting assessment pods and isolation units in hospital car parks, and they are now working on the government\u2019s national programme of mortuaries.</p> <p>\u201cWe were contacted by the commercial directorate of the Cabinet Office asking what could we do around \u2018storage buildings\u2019,\u201d says company director Robert Snook. \u201cIt soon became clear what that meant.\u201d Portakabin has form in refrigerated storage, with previous prefab modules being erected to store everything from exotic orchid bulbs to fine wines. The morgues\u2019 racking and shelving systems, however, were a new challenge. The bulk of the firm\u2019s work to date has been in delivering large amounts of overspill space for hospitals, so wards with lower-risk patients could be relocated to free up more space for those with Covid-19 in the main hospital buildings. Snook says this is all business as usual for a company that is used to rapid response, having delivered an emergency hospital to the Falkland Islands during the war in the 1980s, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/06/fastest-school-ever-built-opens-for-pupils-displaced-by-grenfell-tower-fire\">built an entire secondary school in </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/06/fastest-school-ever-built-opens-for-pupils-displaced-by-grenfell-tower-fire\">nine weeks</a> following the Grenfell Tower fire. \u201cThis is all standard stuff for us,\u201d says Snook. \u201cThe main challenge has actually been getting our hands on enough <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/01/nhs-staff-making-masks-from-snorkels-amid-ppe-shortages\">FFP3 face masks</a> for our workers to wear in the factory.\u201d</p> <p>While companies such as Portakabin have been supplying standard modular shells as usual, with the factories working full pelt, some situations have required more bespoke solutions. One of the most technically demanding of the temporary structures so far has been the transformation of the ExCel convention centre at the Docklands area in east London into an emergency field hospital, NHS Nightingale, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/nightingale-hospital-in-london-to-treat-less-critical-covid-19-cases\">ultimately capable of holding 4,000 patients</a>. The gargantuan exhibition halls have hosted a diverse range of functions in the past, from the Crufts dog show to <a href=\"https://www.stopthearmsfair.org.uk/about/dsei/\">international arms fairs</a>, but this incarnation has stretched the building\u2019s flexible nature to the limit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"175a77007948b7204254bf21740dfc5cb2e11c12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/175a77007948b7204254bf21740dfc5cb2e11c12/44_0_4624_2775/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A queue at a drive-through testing station for NHS staff at the Wembley Ikea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A queue at a drive-through testing station for NHS staff at the Wembley Ikea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Completed in nine days, it has \u2013 like every other part of the national response to Covid-19 \u2013 been worked out on the fly. The location was settled on in mid-March, after other large sports halls and warehouses were considered. The ventilation system is equipped to handle large numbers of people, the floors are riddled with mechanical service boxes and there is a readily available supply of modular partitions and teams of technicians used to mounting exhibitions overnight.</p> <p>\u201cThe strategy was all about using as much of the existing infrastructure as possible,\u201d says James Hepburn of BDP architects, who led on the design team for the project. \u201cIt was clear on day one how difficult procurement was going to be, as a lot of factories were shutting down. We used the exhibition partitions with a bit of extra stiffening to create the bedheads, then ran the power, water, drainage and medical gas in a long service run behind, mirroring the bed bays on either side.\u201d Visibility between the bays was key, given that the doctors will each be charged with many more patients than usual.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"000cb86231f07d889d520df4a1f91a51677d2bac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/000cb86231f07d889d520df4a1f91a51677d2bac/0_116_5055_3033/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Contractors transform the ExCel centre in east London into the NHS Nightingale hospital in late March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Contractors transform the ExCel centre in east London into the NHS Nightingale hospital in late March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The site became a 24-hour production line, coordinated by army personnel, seeing vinyl floor laid, partitions erected and teams of electricians assembling prefabricated dado trunking to be screwed to the bedheads as soon as they were up. The central boulevard between the conference halls, usually home to networking delegates, has been transformed into a controlled zone where medics don and doff protective clothing, while the waterfront cafes have become their much-needed rest areas. Of course, there is a mortuary, too. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that when the army sets up a camp with a field hospital, one of first things they do is build the mortuary,\u201d says Hepburn. \u201cThere\u2019s a psychological element to it \u2013 if you\u2019re in a war situation, knowing that that side of it is dealt with is actually quite reassuring.\u201d</p> <p>Learning from their experiences, BDP has produced<a href=\"https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/nhs-nightingale-bdp-on-the-first-nine-days-converting-the-excel-centre/10046749.article\"> a</a><a href=\"https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/nhs-nightingale-bdp-on-the-first-nine-days-converting-the-excel-centre/10046749.article\"> \u201chow to\u201d guide</a>, drawn in the clear diagrammatic style of an Ikea furniture-building manual, to help other projects.

Despite the rushed intensity of the process, might the whole experience offer some lessons for the future?<br><br>\u201cIf someone asked you to design a hospital like this, you would normally say you need six months and an enormous team of carefully selected individuals, not a group of people thrown together over a weekend,\u201d says Hepburn. \u201cHere, there wasn\u2019t the usual \u2018design responsibility matrix\u2019 or any of the admin that bogs everyone down. It was a very liberating, free-form collaborative approach, and it shows what\u2019s possible when everyone really pulls together with a common goal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf we ever get back to normal,\u201d he adds, \u201cprojects are going to become very frustrating when someone says no.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>When Michelle Paver won the Guardian children\u2019s fiction prize in 2010 for the final book in her bestselling Chronicles of Ancient Darkness series, she was done with the stone age adventures of the boy Torak, his wolf companion, and the girl Renn. \u201cAs soon as you write that last line and finish the book they are gone,\u201d she told the Guardian at the time, \u201cand they don\u2019t come back.\u201d</p> <p>Ten years later, Torak, Renn and Wolf are, in fact, back, <a href=\"https://www.thebookseller.com/news/michelle-pavers-legendary-wolf-brother-be-adapted-tv-1198319\">both in an upcoming TV adaptation of the first six books</a> and in Paver\u2019s latest novel, Viper\u2019s Daughter. Now Torak is on the trail of Renn, who has disappeared without a word. \u201cTracking was what Torak did best, and even by starlight he found Renn\u2019s three-day-old trail. To his alarm, it didn\u2019t lead towards the valley where the clan was camped, but down to the River Blackthorn where he and Renn kept their canoe. The canoe was gone,\u201d Paver writes, before sending her stone age boy and his wolf on a quest to the far north, where they\u2019ll be hunted by ice bears, and face their most evil enemy yet. It\u2019s wonderful \u2013 sheer escapism, for children and adults alike.</p> <p>\u201cI missed them acutely when I finished Ghost Hunter,\u201d says Paver now, who has spent the interim years publishing a handful of critically acclaimed novels for adults, from the terrifying ghost story Dark Matter and Thin Air, where five Englishmen set out to climb Kangchenjunga and which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/20/thin-air-michelle-paver-review\">was described as a \u201ca heart-freezing masterpiece\u201d by the Observer</a>. \u201cIt was immersive and great fun to be writing an adult gothic, or a ghost story, but even when I was writing them, Torak and Renn and Wolf didn\u2019t go away. They\u2019d pop into my head at odd moments, and that is very different to other books.\u201d</p> <p>On a trip to the Malangen fjord in northern Norway, she went out into the snow one night and the northern lights appeared: \u201cNot the massively lurid ones you see in documentaries, but it was like a twisted arrow or arch pointing north, and it gave me an idea. What if one of the trio leaves? And that\u2019s when the ideas started fizzing.\u201d</p> <p>Paver was in the middle of research for another adult novel \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/dec/07/wakenhyrst-by-michelle-paver-review\">Wakenhyrst</a>, about a lonely child growing up in the middle of the marshes in Edwardian Suffolk \u2013 so she had to put the germ of an idea for what would become Viper\u2019s Daughter aside. But she\u2019s no stranger to letting ideas percolate until they find their time: while studying biochemistry at Oxford in the late 70s, she found herself getting increasingly interested in writing and attempted a Mills &amp; Boon. \u201cIt was absolute rubbish. I was so arrogant. I had complete contempt for Mills &amp; Boon and thought it must be easy, so wrote it in three weeks and sent it in. Of course it got rejected.\u201d</p> <p>The next thing she wrote was set in Viking-age Norway about a boy, a wolf and a large bear. That got rejected, too \u2013 but 23 years later, while looking through her old manuscripts she realised there was something there. She shifted the story to the stone age and wrote Wolf Brother, the first book in the Chronicles of Ancient Darkness, which opens as Torak and his father are attacked by a demon bear.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"06412b4be71e0f143daedf46ff3796eec8151f98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06412b4be71e0f143daedf46ff3796eec8151f98/0_273_2884_1732/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Paver with a wolf in 2004.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paver with a wolf in 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Upton/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the interim, she \u201ctook a bit of a wrong turn\u201d, becoming a biotechnological patents lawyer for 13 years. \u201cI thought, \u2018I\u2019m quite good at exams, why don\u2019t I do law for a couple of years and maybe I\u2019ll be published by then?\u2019\u201d After years of trying to write in the evenings and at weekends, and not really wanting to be a lawyer at all, she \u201chad to jump off the treadmill\u201d. She resigned without a book deal. During her six months\u2019 notice period, she landed one. \u201cMy earnings fell off a cliff. I went from six figures to earning less than a student teacher. But it was unbelievable how much it felt like the right thing. I didn\u2019t have to dress up in Armani trouser suits, I could just wear jeans.\u201d</p> <p>She was writing historical novels when her agent told her to consider other genres. That\u2019s when she came across her old manuscript. She wrote her agent a page-and-a-half, and he rang the next day to say \u201cdrop everything\u201d. She did, and worked solidly on the story for six weeks: Wolf Brother sold in a \u00a32m book deal.</p> <p>Paver takes her research seriously, getting to know the wolves at the UK Wolf Conservation Trust, swimming with orcas, eating raw seal liver and whale blubber to better imagine how her characters would have experienced life. Torak\u2019s world is a long way from her home on Wimbledon Common, where she\u2019s currently writing the next two books in what will be a trilogy. She still starts out in longhand, before typing up her books on her 21-year-old computer, backing up on floppy disk and steering well clear of the internet and email.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost a religion with me not to do email. I love the fact my computer is not accessible,\u201d she says. \u201cI know for lots of people that would be impossible for their work but at a time like this, I\u2019d be the same as everyone else, going on to 24-hour news and seeing what the latest on the coronavirus is.\u201d</p> <p>For Viper\u2019s Daughter, she went to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/aug/26/haida-gwaii-people-islands-archipelago-british-columbia-canada-kayaking\">Haida Gwaii</a>, an archipelago off the coast of British Columbia, crawling into an ice cave under a glacier as she researched the climax of the novel, and to Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean, the last home of the woolly mammoth, flying to the far side of Siberia and taking an icebreaker to get there. (She\u2019s since curtailed travel, wanting to reduce her carbon footprint.)

  "<p>Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has declared a month-long state of emergency in response to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus pandemic</a>, and unveiled a record stimulus package aimed at steering the world\u2019s third-largest economy through its biggest crisis since the war.</p> <p>Abe told a televised news conference a recent sharp rise in Covid-19 cases in Tokyo and other urban areas had forced him to rethink Japan\u2019s approach towards stemming the outbreak.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not at a stage where rapid nationwide spread is being observed, but some areas are under pressure, so we don\u2019t have the luxury of time,\u201d he said, adding that the rise in infections was straining the country\u2019s health service.</p> <p>\u201cTo relieve that pressure there will have to be a transformation in people\u2019s behaviour,\u201d he said. \u201cPreventing an explosion in cases, saving people in serious conditions and protecting you and your loved ones depends on how we change our behaviour.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/europe-looks-past-lockdowns-as-us-and-japan-brace-for-coronavirus-trauma\">Europe looks past lockdowns as US and Japan brace for coronavirus trauma</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Abe asked people to reduce their contact with others by 70-80%, saying successful social distancing could see infections peak in two weeks. He called on non-essential workers to work from home and for companies to stagger shifts for employees who cannot remotely.</p> <p>Invoking the community spirit that emerged in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster on Japan\u2019s north-east coast nine years ago, Abe said: \u201cThat was a very difficult time, but the bonds that formed between people gave us hope. We are again facing a crisis, but if we work together, we will rise to the challenge and defeat this virus.\u201d</p> <p>The state of emergency will last until 6 May and initially apply to Tokyo and six other prefectures: Chiba, Kanagawa and Saitama prefectures, which border the capital, Osaka and neighbouring Hyogo in the west, and Fukuoka in the south-west.</p> <p>Japan has avoided the large number of Covid-19 cases and deaths that have prompted lockdowns in other countries, but there is growing alarm over the rise in infections in the capital, particularly among young people.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Japan\" data-alt=\"Japan graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Japan\">Japan graphic</a> </figure>  <p>By Monday there were 1,116 confirmed infections in the metropolitan region of 14 million people. Nationwide, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan\">Japan</a> has 3,906 confirmed cases, as well as a 712 from a cruise ship quarantined at Yokohama port near Tokyo, with 91 deaths.</p> <p>While the figures are low compared to the US, China and parts of Europe, officials are concerned that Tokyo\u2019s hospitals would be unable to cope with a surge in infections.</p> <p>The declaration will give prefectural governors the authority to call on people to stay at home and for non-essential businesses to close, but will stop some way short of the stricter lockdowns in the US and parts of Europe.</p> <p>Japan\u2019s government does not have the legal authority to enforce a France-style lockdown with fines and other penalties. Instead, officials are hoping that <em>jishuku</em> \u2013 or self-restraint \u2013 and threats to name and shame businesses that refuse to close will ensure compliance. A poll conducted over the weekend by the TV network TBS found that 80% of respondents supported the move.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not a lockdown of the kind that have happened overseas,\u201d Abe said. \u201cPublic transport will run as usual, and no roads will be closed. There is no need for that. That is the view of the experts.\u201d</p> <p>Local authorities will, though, be able to force companies to sell their supplies of medicine and food, and to expropriate land and buildings for medical facilities.</p> <p>Tokyo\u2019s governor, Yuriko Koike, said the city would start transferring patients with no mild or no symptoms from hospitals to hotels and other accommodations to make room for an influx of more severe cases.</p> <p>Abe\u2019s apparent reluctance to implement tougher measures earlier in the crisis had drawn criticism from the Japan Medical Association and several local leaders.</p> <p>Koike urged Tokyoites to cooperate with requests to keep their trips outside to a minimum. \u201cIt will cause inconvenience in daily life, but I call on everyone to cooperate, because lives are at stake,\u201d she told reporters.</p> <p>The majority of cases confirmed in the capital over the weekend involved people aged below 50, with many in their 20s and 30s, prompting speculation that bars, restaurants and clubs have become significant sources of infection.</p> <p>Given their focus on highly populated urban centres, the measures are expected to hit consumption and production, raising fears that the crisis could send the world\u2019s third-biggest economy into recession.</p> <p>In response, the cabinet on Tuesday passed a record stimulus package in an attempt to contain the economic fallout from the outbreak. The measures, worth 108tn yen (\u00a3800bn) \u2013 or 20% of gross domestic product \u2013 include 39tn yen in direct spending.</p> <p>Japan\u2019s reluctance to introduce a more draconian lockdown stems in part from bitter memories of civil rights abuses during the days of militarism and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/14/like-entering-a-prison-japans-leprosy-sufferers-sue-government-for-decades-of-pain\">forced isolation of leprosy patients</a>.</p> <p>Hours before the state of emergency was made official, the hashtag \u201cescape from Tokyo\u201d began trending on social media, triggering calls for residents to stay put.</p> <p>While there were no signs of an exodus, officials were concerned that some people would head for several prefectures that have not recorded a single case of Covid-19, including rural areas with large numbers of older people.</p> <p>\u201cPlease do not go to rural areas, where there are large elderly populations who would be put at risk,\u201d Abe said.</p>",

  "<p>While you have been stuck at home staring at the four walls and everything inside them, you may have noticed that some of what you see is broken. Small problems that may not have bothered you when you spent all day at work \u2013 a wonky curtain, a creaky door \u2013 suddenly demand your attention. But how do you fix things without professional help, armed only with limited tools and even more limited competence? We asked the experts for advice on the 10 simplest DIY tasks you can tackle right now.</p> <h2><strong>Basic sewing</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/sianberry\">Si\u00e2n Berry</a> is the co-leader of the Green party, a member of the London Assembly and a candidate in the now-postponed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/local-london-mayoral-elections-postponed-year-coronavirus-uk\">London mayoral election</a>, but she is also the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mend-Sian-Berry/dp/1856268810\">Mend It! 400 Easy Repairs for Everyday Items</a>. She thinks the humble sewing needle might be the most important DIY tool you already own.</p> <p>\u201cI totally recommend sewing,\u201d she says. \u201cReplace those buttons, get those hems exactly the right length.\u201d But what if you can\u2019t sew? \u201cHemming is surprisingly easy,\u201d she insists. \u201cThere\u2019s a special stitch for hemming where you\u2019re basically hanging the fabric off very tiny stitches which don\u2019t go through to the outside. It\u2019s a really good skill because you can get all your clothes to fit you perfectly.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Hanging pictures</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29630b335a71ceba2c8e4cf7a229bc0c07316c1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29630b335a71ceba2c8e4cf7a229bc0c07316c1e/0_0_5304_3182/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Couple hanging a picture together\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">All you need for smaller, lighter pictures is a hammer and a nail.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hinterhaus Productions/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is a basic skill, requiring only the most basic tools. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a hammer and a nail, it will be enough,\u201d says Jay Blades, a furniture restorer and the presenter of the hit BBC series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/26/the-repair-shop-we-can-fix-anything-but-a-broken-heart-and-brexit\">The Repair Shop</a>. \u201cHammer a nail into the wall, being mindful that there are no wires around. And you should only be going through the plaster. You don\u2019t need to hammer the nail all the way through to your next-door neighbour.\u201d This should be sufficient for smaller pictures, he says, \u201cas long as it\u2019s not a Picasso that weighs quite a lot\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Affixing other things</strong></h2> <p>If you want to stick anything heavier to the wall \u2013 a shelf, a towel rail, a Picasso \u2013 you will need a drill, screws and some kind of fixing plug. Jo Behari, one of the authors of Beginner\u2019s Guide to DIY &amp; Home Repair, says you first need to determine what kind of wall you are dealing with \u2013 a stud wall or a solid wall.</p> <p>\u201cStud walls are just partition walls that cut off rooms,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you knock on them they\u2019re really hollow sounding \u2013 they\u2019re made of wood and plasterboard. You don\u2019t want to hang anything really heavy on those.\u201d To put up a flat-screen TV or a big mirror, you need a solid wall made of brick, plus a masonry drill bit.</p> <p>\u201cA masonry bit has a wide spiral and a little arrow at the tip, which is made of tungsten carbide,\u201d she says. A wood bit, preferable for stud walls, has a sharply pointed tip. Once you\u2019ve drilled your hole, tap in a suitable plug with a hammer. Stud walls require butterfly fixings that \u201cpoke through the hole and grab at the back of the wall\u201d. Brick walls take a more bullet-shaped plug.</p> <h2><strong>Resealing your bath</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bea6a335aa617b170c7883c897a19e83c88e2569\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bea6a335aa617b170c7883c897a19e83c88e2569/0_0_3872_2592/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Resealing a bath\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Resealing your bath is easier than it sounds \u2013 but be sure to practise using the cartridge gun on a piece of card.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MyrKu/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Behari makes this sound easy. \u201cTo remove the old sealant you just need a Stanley knife,\u201d she says. Slice through the top and bottom edges of the seal at one end. \u201cThen you dig a little bit out and just start to pull, and it will all come out quite nicely.\u201d Remove any extra old sealant with a scraper and clean down with white spirit.</p> <p>\u201cBefore resealing, fill your bath up with water, because then it\u2019s at its heaviest point.\u201d That way the gap between tub and tile is at its widest. If you have never applied sealant with a cartridge gun, Behari recommends practising on a bit of cardboard, until you get the hang of it.</p> <p>\u201cTry to keep a consistent run all round the bathtub. To smooth it off, you can use a bit of washing-up liquid on your finger or water and a teaspoon. It will dry within 24 hours. You can\u2019t wash for that period of time, but, you know, who\u2019s washing these days?\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Bookshelves</strong></h2> <p>Makeshift shelves can be produced with no tools, from scrap wood. \u201cYou can probably still find random bits of wood on your state-sanctioned walk,\u201d says Berry. \u201cBits of wood and bricks make a lovely, sort-of-temporary bookshelf. At a pinch, you could use books for the uprights.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>A dripping tap</strong></h2> <p>First: shut off the water. If you do nothing else during lockdown, Behari strongly recommends you locate your stopcock and make sure it is operable. \u201cIt\u2019s normally under the kitchen sink, or in the hallway, or in a cellar.\u201d</p> <p>Another vital tip: put the plug in the sink or the bath before you start, so that if you drop anything small it doesn\u2019t disappear down the drain.</p> <p>A dripping tap probably needs a new rubber washer. More modern taps have ceramic washers, which don\u2019t tend to fail. \u201cTo work out if it is the washer,\u201d says Blades, \u201ctake apart another tap that\u2019s not dripping and swap the washers over.\u201d</p> <p>How do you get at the washer in the first place? \u201cThere will be a way to access the screw that allows you to take apart the tap,\u201d says Behari. \u201cIt might be under the little caps that say hot and cold, they might lever off, or there might be a tiny little hex screw at the back of the tap which you can undo.\u201d Seek out a YouTube demonstration of the repair for your specific type of tap.</p> <p>No matter what, you will need to secure a new washer, but this is not impossible. \u201cYou can actually still get stuff delivered.\u201d says Behari. A pack of washers of mixed sizes can be had for as little as a quid online.</p> <h2><strong>Cracks or holes in walls or furniture</strong></h2> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s best to fill cracks that are going to move \u2013 doorways, windows, those kind of areas \u2013 with something called caulk,\u201d says Behari. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit more flexible.\u201d Otherwise, ordinary filler \u2013 powdered or pre-mixed \u2013 will do, but if it is a deep crack you need to apply the filler in thin layers, so the stuff at the back gets a chance to dry.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For a really big hole, scrunch up bits of newspaper and fill it, so the filler has something to grab on to</p> <footer> <cite>Jo Behari</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For a really big hole in a wall, there is another solution. \u201cThis sounds like a massive bodge, but it\u2019s not,\u201d says Behari. \u201cScrunch up bits of newspaper and fill the hole, so the filler has something to grab on to. And always fill your hole slightly proud of the surface so you can sand away the excess.\u201d</p> <p>If you have got a crack in a wooden surface and nothing to hand, you can make your own filler. \u201cIf you saw a piece of wood, you then create some sawdust,\u201d says Blades. \u201cYou can put that sawdust into the crack, mix it up with some glue on top, and then that will create your kind of wood filler. You can sand it back, you can even stain it, because it\u2019s basically wood shavings with glue.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>A blocked drain</strong></h2> <p>\u201cReally simple \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t even need any tools,\u201d says Behari. \u201cIt\u2019s just a case of putting bicarbonate of soda down the drain, flushing it through with vinegar. That really clears all the blockages out of your kitchen sink. That\u2019s a really simple thing that people should be doing on a regular basis, but probably aren\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>If your shower drain is blocked, however, it\u2019s probably hair, according to Blades. \u201cWhat I do is take the drain cover off and pull out whatever\u2019s in there with a metal hanger \u2013 unravel it obviously. Hair being hair, if you twist it around it will latch on to it normally \u2013 nine times out of 10.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>A stuck door</strong></h2> <p>A door that catches in its frame could have loose hinges, so check that. If the screws are loose and refuse to tighten, Behari and Blades offer the same solution: plugging the screw hole with matchsticks. \u201cStuff as many as you possible can in there,\u201d says Blades, \u201cthen cut them off so the hole is flush, and when you screw your screw back in that will be unbelievably tight.\u201d</p> <p>If the door is still catching against the frame or the carpet below, then you\u2019ve got to check where it makes contact, and mark it with chalk. After that, there is only one solution: \u201c This is good exercise for your triceps,\u201d says Blades. \u201cIt\u2019s rubbing down with coarse sandpaper.\u201d And don\u2019t stop when your sandpaper becomes clogged with dust and you haven\u2019t got any more. \u201cI hoover my sandpaper,\u201d says Blades. \u201cThen it becomes new sandpaper again. I haven\u2019t bought sandpaper in years.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Tackling draughts</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ea10b4766bc19e2df43017f8b4b22a98b5cf2cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ea10b4766bc19e2df43017f8b4b22a98b5cf2cc/0_0_2681_2825/949..jpg\" alt=\"Sian Berry\u2019s sausage dog draught excluder\" width=\"949\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Si\u00e2n Berry\u2019s sausage dog draught excluder.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Si\u00e2n Berry</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Repairing or rehanging a draughty door may be beyond the skills of a DIY initiate, but making a patchwork draught excluder isn\u2019t, according to Berry. She favours a dog design (hers is pictured). \u201cYou can do a snake,\u201d she says. \u201cSnakes are easier. But the dog\u2019s face is just one of the nicest things; you just start filling it with old socks or tights, or whatever you\u2019re using, and it gains a personality immediately.\u201d</p> <p>To make the snake excluder, you will need a piece of fabric 40cm wide and 5cm longer than the width of your door. \u201cFold the material over inside-out, sew the long edge together into a tube and close off one end of the tube,\u201d says Berry. \u201cThen turn it inside-out again so the hem is inside and the best side of the fabric is facing out.</p> <p>\u201cUse the leg of an old pair of tights as the inner lining and fill with stuffing. You can use rice, lentils, sand or similar \u2013 just make sure you sew it up tightly, so no bits can escape. Then drop the stuffed tights into your material tube.\u201d After that, you can sew up the mouth end, including a red ribbon for a tongue, and add buttons for eyes.</p>",
  "<p> Joe Biden was not their <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/entrance-and-exit-polls/california/democratic\">first choice.</a> In some cases, he wasn\u2019t even their <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/state/nevada\">second</a> or <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/state/iowa\">third</a>. Now, as the all-but-certain nominee, Biden is aggressively courting a critical constituency of younger and leftwing Democrats who have so far rejected his presidential bid.</p> <p>Last month, Biden stitched together a wide range of support from African Americans, suburbanites and working-class white voters to rack up wins across the country and amass an almost indomitable lead over his rival, democratic socialist senator Bernie Sanders. Yet missing from that coalition is the young and more liberal voters who overwhelmingly prefer Sanders\u2019 call for political revolution to Biden\u2019s promise of a return to \u201cnormalcy\u201d.</p> <p>Determined not to repeat the mistakes of 2016, when the party struggled to unify after a divisive primary battle that stretched into the summer convention, Biden is now amplifying his appeals to the party\u2019s left.</p> <p>According to campaign officials, his team has for weeks quietly engaged top progressive organizations and movement leaders representing a range of Democratic causes from climate change to racial justice. The effort, spearheaded by senior Biden advisers, includes outreach to legacy organizations such as Planned Parenthood as well as newer, youth-led groups like the Sunrise Movement.</p> <p>Biden has also made overt gestures. He recently adopted a plan by his former rival, Elizabeth Warren, to overhaul the consumer bankruptcy system and embraced elements of Sanders\u2019 tuition-free college proposal.</p> <p>\u201cLet me say, especially to the young voters who have been inspired by senator Sanders: I hear you,\u201d Biden said after sweeping three major primary contests last month. \u201cI know what is at stake. And I know what we have to do.\u201d</p> <p>There is a delicacy around the engagement, especially with Sanders still claiming his campaign has a \u201cnarrow path\u201d to the nomination despite calls to bow out of the race. The left came tantalizing close to nominating a presidential candidate they hold up as a progressive champion only to watch in dismay as Biden, who is unquestionably more moderate, all-but vanquished those hopes, and with startling speed.</p> <p>There is a mutual understanding that the party must unify to defeat Donald Trump in November. But progressives also believe they have built sufficient leverage to press for sweeping policy concessions from Biden, particularly given the potentially worrisome <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-consolidates-support-trails-badly-enthusiasm-poll/story?id=69812092\">lack of enthusiasm</a> for his candidacy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ddfa99eed81e26204158c3c340e4fa2f16f1c60a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ddfa99eed81e26204158c3c340e4fa2f16f1c60a/0_36_2918_1751/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Democratic US presidential candidates Senator Bernie Sanders and former vice-president Joe Biden at the 11th Democratic candidates debate in Washington on 15 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Democratic US presidential candidates Senator Bernie Sanders and former vice-president Joe Biden at the 11th Democratic candidates debate in Washington on 15 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cJoe Biden, as the moderate frontrunner, has to convince progressives to support him,\u201d said Julian Brave NoiseCat, who directs Green New Deal strategy at the progressive think tank Data for Progress. \u201cHe needs more enthusiasm behind his campaign, and it\u2019s been a bruising campaign cycle.\u201d</p> <p>In interviews with progressive organizers, climate change has emerged as a key area where activists believe they can \u201cpush\u201d the former vice-president, in part because combatting global warming draws broad support from every corner of the party. Several <a href=\"https://www.people-press.org/2020/02/13/as-economic-concerns-recede-environmental-protection-rises-on-the-publics-policy-agenda/\">polls</a> this cycle have found that Democratic voters rank climate change among their top three issues, often second only to healthcare.</p> <p>Data for Progress, along with climate staff from Washington governor Jay Inslee\u2019s former presidential campaign, are among those urging the Biden team to prioritize climate change.</p> <p>In a recent six-page memo, the group laid out five policy areas where he could issue new proposals or emphasize existing ones. They are: stronger clean energy standards with clearer targets, investments in green infrastructure, a dedicated 40% of climate money going to disadvantaged communities, restrictions on Wall Street financing of fossil fuels and a commitment to high-quality union jobs. NoiseCat said the Biden campaign is engaging the authors at a high level.</p> <p>Some progressives believe Biden, who spent decades in the Senate before serving as vice president, would have a better shot at moving climate legislation through Congress because of his longstanding relationships and pragmatic approach. Biden also has strong ties to labor unions that are <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/5/22/18628299/green-new-deal-labor-union-2020-democrats\">skeptical</a> of ambitious proposals to tackle climate change.</p> <p>Already Biden has suggested Democrats should push for \u201cGreen Deal\u201d spending in the next aid package responding to the economic downturn spurred by the coronavirus pandemic. Though he is unlikely to endorse policies to significantly curb drilling for oil and natural gas \u2013 like a fracking ban \u2013 which could alienate supporters in swing states like Pennsylvania.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot more that can be done to have the full-scale mobilization of the federal government that is needed to defeat climate change,\u201d said Jamal Raad, former aide to Inslee\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign. \u201cThat\u2019s the task at hand here for the next president.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b079b23e74cfb602451d78bb9601d9ebba060775\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b079b23e74cfb602451d78bb9601d9ebba060775/0_0_4392_2928/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Biden speaks during a campaign rally at Renaissance High School in Detroit.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Biden speaks during a campaign rally at Renaissance High School in Detroit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Progressive activists say their overriding priority in 2020 is to defeat Trump. But they warn that antipathy for the president is not enough to win in November. And how Biden engages the left and what concessions he is willing to make could determine the nature of their electoral efforts on his behalf.</p> <p>\u201cWill enough people be willing to volunteer for the nominee? Or send text messages for the nominee? Or overcome the barriers of voter suppression that we know are coming to vote for the nominee,\u201d said Jennifer Epps-Addison, the network director at the Center for Popular Democracy, which endorsed Sanders. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s at stake.\u201d</p> <p>Epps-Addison echoed many Democratic activists in urging Biden to put a progressive standard-bearer on the ticket with him. Biden has said he would choose a woman as his running mate, an overture to Democrats deeply disappointed that two white men in their 70s emerged from a historically diverse and female presidential field.</p> <p>Both Democratic contenders have vowed to actively support whoever becomes the party\u2019s nominee.</p> <p>Yet Biden, confined to his home in Delaware amid the coronavirus outbreak, has so far struggled to re-create the grassroots excitement that has powered Sanders\u2019 presidential bid, with packed rallies and an endless stream of small-dollar donations. Meanwhile, Sanders has continued to criticize his opponent\u2019s record.</p> <p>Asked during the last Democratic debate how he might appeal to Sanders\u2019 supporters if he became the nominee, Biden quipped: \u201cHe\u2019s making it hard for me right now.\u201d</p> <p>Though Sanders\u2019 chances of clinching the nomination have faded, the progressive proposals he championed on healthcare, climate change and student debt remain widely popular among Democratic voters \u2013 a point the senator has made explicitly as he defends his continued presence in the primary race. His ideas, the senator has asserted, are winning the \u201cideological\u201d and \u201cgenerational\u201d debate\u201d \u2013 even if he is not.</p> <p>Biden may be the eventual nominee, said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which endorsed Warren, but \u201ctens of millions of people who supported Warren and Sanders nonetheless wanted a president who advocated for bold, progressive policy ideas.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b2f597d7003396166e97b1512b3bf3da1527dbbb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2f597d7003396166e97b1512b3bf3da1527dbbb/0_0_6192_4128/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Joe Biden addresses the media and a small group of supporters with his wife Dr Jill Biden during a primary night event on 10 March in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Biden addresses the media and a small group of supporters with his wife Dr Jill Biden during a primary night event on 10 March in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Makela/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alexis Confer, executive director of March For Our Lives, which was founded by survivors of the Parkland high school shooting in Florida, said the best way for Biden to reach young voters is to address their priorities with a shared sense of urgency.</p> <p>\u201cWe see our daily work as fighting the largest epidemic in our country,\u201d Confer said, referring to the scourge of gun violence that <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/08/16/what-the-data-says-about-gun-deaths-in-the-u-s/\">claims</a> more than 36,000 American lives each year. But they also view their activism as part of a wider movement for social, racial and economic justice, she added, emphasizing that \u201cpeople don\u2019t live single-issue lives.\u201d</p> <p>In discussions with Biden\u2019s team, March for Our Lives is advocating for a 10-day waiting period on all firearm purchases, a federal gun licensing program and the creation of an administration role dedicated to combating gun violence.</p> <p>Pro-choice organizations are also eager to see Biden elevate his support for reproductive rights, especially in light of <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-04-02/red-states-block-abortion-coronavirus-outbreak\">efforts</a> in conservative states to restrict abortions during the pandemic.<br><br>Early in the primary season, Biden <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/06/abortion-joe-biden-hyde-amendment\">abandoned</a> his support for the Hyde Amendment, which bans the use of federal funds for abortion with some exceptions. But he has a shifting voting record on the issue and some advocates have called on him to release a standalone plan outlining his commitment to defending reproductive rights.<br><br>\u201cVoters need to know that addressing this crisis is top of mind for our next president and that our nominee understands that reproductive freedom is fundamental to achieving meaningful equity in society,\u201d NARAL President Ilyse Hogue said in a statement.</p> <p>Immigration is a particularly thorny issue for Biden. Throughout the primary season, he has faced fierce criticism from immigration activists over the Obama administration\u2019s deportation policy, which resulted in the removal of roughly three million people. At campaign events and even during Democratic debates, Biden was met with protests and interruptions from activists shouting: \u201cNot one more deportation.\u201d</p> <p>Cristina Jim\u00e9nez, executive director of United We Dream Action, a youth-led immigrant rights network, said Biden has work to do to \u201cbridge the trust gap\u201d with Latino voters, a powerful Democratic constituency that tends to be younger. In the primary, many of these voters flocked to Sanders, who proposed a sweeping overhaul of the nation\u2019s immigration system.</p> <p>Her group, which jointly endorsed Sanders and Warren, expects to meet with Biden\u2019s team in the coming weeks. In those discussions, they intend to press him to commit to using executive authority to expand programs like Daca, which shields certain immigrants from deportation and to repeal a 1996 law that increased penalties for crossing the border illegally.</p> <p>Biden has acknowledged the \u201cincredible pain\u201d caused by deportation and recently pledged to halt nearly all removals in the first 100 days of his administration, a move activists believes is a testament to their advocacy.</p> <p>Still, many progressives remain skeptical.</p> <p>\u201cRight now it still feels like more of the same,\u201d said Erika Andiola, chief advocacy officer at the immigration services organization Raices Action and a former staffer on Sanders\u2019 2016 campaign. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have to keep pushing him.\u201d</p> <p>In a virtual fundraiser on Friday, Biden was optimistic that he could find common ground with the Democrats most leery of his campaign in time to bring the party together in November.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of good ideas they have \u2013 I disagree with many of them,\u201d Biden said. But he continued: \u201cThere\u2019s lot of significant change that can take place \u2013 both structurally and practically \u2013 that can bring everybody along.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>\u2018How was <em>your</em> last couple of years? Anybody else get in global amounts of trouble?\u201d It was only a matter of time before Louis CK, disgraced in 2017 when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/10/louis-ck-statement-sexual-misconduct-allegations-these-stories-are-true\">admitted to masturbating in front of several female comedians,</a> confirmed his comeback with a special. Sure enough last weekend, mid-lockdown and out of the blue, Sincerely Louis CK \u2013 recorded in Washington DC last year \u2013 was made available on his website. </p> <p>Like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/apr/04/aziz-ansari-road-to-nowhere-review-hammersmith-apollo-london\">Aziz Ansari\u2019s corresponding show</a> a year ago, this set is hard to watch through any lens other than that of CK\u2019s behaviour. And, of course, he addresses them, in a manner you may find less pious than Ansari\u2019s, or less penitent, depending on how reprehensible you considered CK (or how much you loved his work) in the first place. Judging by this set, CK doesn\u2019t think he did anything uniquely bad. Everyone has their sexual quirks, he argues, and now, he reports shamefaced, \u201ceveryone knows mine\u201d \u2013 from Barack Obama to the Italian kid pointing at him recently in an airport.</p> <p>Towards the end, he fronts up to the issue of consent, reminding his audience that he sought consent from the women involved, but acknowledging (indirectly, via jokes about a similarity between the sounds of female sexual pleasure and slaves singing \u201cNegro spirituals\u201d in the fields) that that may not have been enough. This not-quite apology \u2013 heavier on self-pity than concern for the women involved \u2013 won\u2019t be enough for those outraged by CK\u2019s behaviour. But it\u2019s all we\u2019re getting, and at least it\u2019s consistent with CK\u2019s unsentimental worldview, which sees us all as amoral screw-ups struggling to get from cradle to grave with some shreds of dignity intact.</p> <p>That is the keynote in a show with a handful of jokes to recall CK\u2019s once permanent residency on all those \u201cworld\u2019s best\u201d lists, and more that recall <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/12/louis-ck-review-edinburgh-playhouse-standup-comedy\">his too cynical 2016 Edinburgh festival show</a>. You can\u2019t say he\u2019s not hunting big game, comedically speaking. He opens with a section on God that includes an unsparing riff on his mother\u2019s recent death and cremation. God is summoned to Earth to clear things up with a five-minute press conference \u2013 which, coincidentally, gives sexual deviants a free pass but comes down hard on carnivores. (\u201cHow could you eat a perfectly fuckable pig?\u201d)</p> <p>That\u2019s far from the only routine in whose margins CK\u2019s harassment scandal lurks, just out of vision. Elsewhere, there\u2019s some straightforward baiting of liberal pieties, as with a routine about \u201cretarded people\u201d that feigns to strike a blow for social justice while savouring the phrase \u201cretarded people\u201d a little too much; a riff on whether CK wants to \u201cfuck kids\u201d or not; and another about a Japanese waitress with a funny accent. Sometimes, it\u2019s all a bit of a strain: \u201cI used to date a woman who was vegan. So I had to fuck her with my dick substitute.\u201d Oh dear.</p> <p>Perhaps, now the veil has slipped, CK can no longer be bothered pretending to the loftier ideals that used to offset his more cynical material.

Last year the New York Times published an exhaustive investigation, notably including recordings of Russian pilots, that directly incriminated Russia in attacks on hospitals in rebel areas.</p> <p>HRW\u2019s director, Kenneth Roth, wrote on Twitter: \u201cUN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres gave an excessively narrow mandate to a board of inquiry into attacks on hospitals in Syria, and the inquiry now produces a mealy-mouthed report, all to avoid offending Russia, the prime offender along with Syria.\u201d</p> <p>In July last year the security council issued a rare formal diplomatic petition demanding Guterres open an investigation into airstrikes on medical facilities.</p> <p>The move infuriated Moscow, which has repeatedly used international forums \u2013 such as its veto as a permanent member of the UN security council \u2013 to shield Assad from international action. Since intervening in the Syrian war on the regime\u2019s behalf in 2015, Russia has repeatedly denied that its own aircraft target civilian sites.</p> <p>Guterres attributed the small number of incidents examined in the new report to the absence of UN personnel on the ground and refusal of permission to visit the sites.</p> <p>The commission looked at bombings carried out between April and July 2019 in Idlib and the surrounding countryside. One hospital was deselected for not meeting the investigation\u2019s criteria, and a raid on a refugee camp was likely to have been carried out by an Islamist group, the report said.</p> <p>The board of inquiry was established in September and its report was supposed to have been submitted by the end of 2019 but was delayed until March.</p> <p>Western countries have been demanding for months that a summary of the report be published. Media <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/world/middleeast/russia-syria-hospital-bombing.html\">reports</a> suggest Russian diplomats pressured Guterres\u2019s office not to release it.</p> <p>The Syrian and Russian delegations to the UN did not immediately comment on the findings.</p>",

The former lawyer was born in 1974, and is the son of a Czech refugee who fled the Nazis in 1938. He studied at both Oxford and Cambridge, and when working for the Foreign Office his job was to lead a team attempting to bring suspected war criminals to justice at The Hague.</p> \n<p>A vocal supporter of Britain\u2019s move to leave the EU, Raab was briefly the Brexit secretary under Johnson\u2019s predecessor Theresa May, but resigned after saying he could not agree to the withdrawal deal that had been struck between her government and the EU.</p> \n<p>The 46-year-old returned to government in July 2019, when Johnson became prime minister.

Since the UK is a parliamentary democracy, there is no need for an election to take place for him to assume the role of de facto prime minister.</p> \n<p>Like many of the Johnson government\u2019s key decision-makers, he was a prominent figure in the 2016 Vote Leave campaign, sent out to tour TV studios and staff up the spin rooms for debates.</p> \n<p>Unlike Michael Gove, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/30/michael-gove-boris-johnson-tory-leadership-downing-street\">dramatic intervention</a> in 2016\u2019s Conservative party leadership contest has been forgiven but not forgotten, Raab is implicitly trusted by Johnson and his team.

  "<p>Dismantling mass incarceration in the United States is not a question of possibility or costs, but a matter of imagination and will. Take the relationship between the criminal legal system and the Covid-19 outbreak. Families and activists have demanded the release of people currently detained in jails, prisons and immigrant detention facilities, and in some cases, they have won. New York has released 300 elders from Rikers Island \u2013 not enough, but a start. Massachusetts courts, under pressure from activists, are considering whether to release anyone. When California released an additional 3,100 people from prison, a media outlet was sure to note that Governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s order included sentence commutations for \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/california-gov-newsom-commutes-sentences-21-including-killers-n1170976\">killers</a>\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/united-states-numbers-dead-unemployed-trump-smaller\">As the numbers of dead and unemployed grow, Trump looks and sounds smaller | Richard Wolffe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What changed? The easy answer is that Covid-19 became a pandemic. Globally, more than 1.2m people have contracted the virus and upwards of 70,000 have succumbed. In the United States, the figures are over 336,000 and 10,000, respectively. Suddenly, student loan deferments, suspended mortgages, calls against evictions, direct cash payments to families and releasing portions of the incarcerated population have all become not only politically possible, but desirable.</p> <p>But these political gains have already faced serious setbacks.</p> <p>First: despite the urgent need for cities and states to decrease their prison populations to protect inmates and staff from Covid-19, and despite the general inability of carceral facilities to offer adequate treatment and protection, the political winds have already shifted in a more regressive direction. Federal prisons are now requiring a <a href=\"https://www.wvnstv.com/top-stories/federal-prisons-to-require-inmates-to-quarantine-in-cells-for-2-weeks/\">two-week quarantine</a> instead of release.</p> <p>Second: the public battle against Covid-19 has had the effect of empowering another pillar of the prison industrial complex \u2013 policing. Thirty states have issued stay-at-home orders enforceable by law enforcement and stacked with fines, citations and even jail time. We cannot let the confusion of the crisis further entrench mass incarceration.</p> <p>Through the Arab spring, Occupy Wall Street, and the Ferguson uprising, a full generation of activists have used street protests and social media to resist state repression, violence and policing. Those options are now limited. Notwithstanding the pandemic, American police have still killed at least 57 people since 1 March. Last year, the police killed 253 during the first quarter; this year, it is 227, a difference of 26 people.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What would have happened if a Chicago officer had shot Laquan McDonald in the back, 16 times, while we were all under quarantine?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But so much is lost in the numbers. Television coverage is almost exclusively on the rapidly spreading Covid-19. Public approval of the police is increasing because the police are considered first responders to the pandemic. Police victims are most likely poor, people of color, or First Nations. Taken together, reporting on police violence, and the lives of their victims, would be unpopular. What would have happened if a Chicago officer had shot Laquan McDonald in the back, 16 times, while we were all under quarantine?</p> <p>We are at risk of police violence generally, and now specifically through this pandemic. In Los Angeles, police are reportedly stopping drivers to inquire about their destinations and issuing <a href=\"https://apnews.com/afs:Content:8700400221\">$400 citations</a>. Rhode Island\u2019s governor ordered state troopers to profile and stop cars <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-29/rhode-island-ends-policy-of-stopping-cars-with-new-york-plates\">with out-of-state license</a> plates. Maryland and Washington DC have issued enforcement orders that are punishable by arrest, a fine up to $1,000 and six months in jail. Even Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officers are still conducting raids to destroy lives, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/31/ice-raids-coronavirus-n95-masks\">wearing N95 masks</a> that could be used to save lives.</p> <p>All these additional surveillance tools are added on top of broken windows policing, racial profiling and stop-and-frisks. If this path continues, people newly freed from jails could find themselves returning to the increasingly occupied communities from where they were arrested, only to be replaced by new waves of arrestees vulnerable to contracting Covid-19 in jail.</p> <p>State divestment from poor neighborhoods, black communities and immigrant circles inevitably means that these groups will be policed the most aggressively and suffer the worst burden of enforcement. \u201cStaying home\u201d \u2013 in overcrowded and sometimes dilapidated housing \u2013 is much easier <a href=\"https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/chicago-politics/lightfoot-shares-hilarious-psa-urging-people-to-stay-home-save-lives/2247859/\">s</a><a href=\"https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/chicago-politics/lightfoot-shares-hilarious-psa-urging-people-to-stay-home-save-lives/2247859/\">ung</a> in a PSA than practiced. Some states permit families to hike together for fresh air yet still outlaw families standing together outside as \u201cloitering\u201d. Near my neighborhood, the police monitor a group of black teenagers who stand at the traffic light with squeegees and window spray. I\u2019m used to chatting with the kids on weekends. Now, t-shirts and hoodies hug their faces. They nod and smile with their eyes for any pocket change to clean cars before the signal switches. I fear for their safety from the coronavirus. And also from the police.</p> <p>As I watch, I think: <em>this is dangerous. They should be inside. They should be learning. Where are their parents?</em> Then, I remember: the teenagers who have adequate safe space and food and activities and quality educational options would probably not be standing outside during a global pandemic for hours for one dollar in the first place.</p> <p>What should we do? How will we enforce social distancing without police? As activists, lawyers, organizers and artists build resources to show us the way, one important step is recognizing what police cannot do. Law enforcement cannot stop the coronavirus. They cannot even stop it among their own ranks. And because politicians refuse free and widely accessible testing and treatment, they risk the lives of police officers, their families and the rest of us by putting sick officers on the street. More than <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/01/more-than-1000-new-york-city-police-officers-are-infected-with-coronavirus.html\">1,000 officers</a> in the New York police department reportedly have coronavirus, as well as <a href=\"https://time.com/5812113/new-jersey-police-coronavirus/\">160 New Jersey</a> officers, and at least<a href=\"https://www.fox2detroit.com/news/almost-500-detroit-police-officers-quarantined-for-possible-coronavirus\"> 500 Detroit officers</a> have been quarantined for possible sickness and exposure.</p> <p>Another important step is to learn what communities are doing right now. Activist organizations are urging police to give warnings to people who violate coronavirus curfews, rather than coming into contact for arrests and citations. This effort would limit contact and decrease transmission between police and residents. Many people are joining or building <a href=\"https://itsgoingdown.org/c19-mutual-aid/\">mutual aid groups</a> to share resources so that people can limit their exposure to Covid-19.</p> <p>In all of this we must continue to fight for a more egalitarian society in the future. In a country with universal healthcare, perhaps people with regular access to quality care would have stronger immune systems to fight the virus. Workers would own the factories that produce our goods and would have better working conditions because they are vested in their own health. Artists would have a basic income and would not worry how to pay for rent or bills. Hotels would not sit empty while homeless people<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/las-vegas-parking-lot-homeless-shelter\"> sleep in concrete squares on parking lots</a> \u2013 we would have universal housing. Addictions, relapses and overdoses would subside because people are not stressed from economic and climate catastrophe. Property would be communal so that anyone, regardless of neighborhood, could have fresh air and sunlight. People would not be forced to stay in domestic violence relationships because their partner is the breadwinner or has health insurance. Families could rotate neighborhood garden visits for fresh food instead of hoarding groceries and tissue from their neighbors.</p> <p>Through strengthened social relationships, people would have less incentive to leave their homes, and we could solve problems without cages and guns.</p> <ul> <li><p>Derecka Purnell is a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul>",

Corona-related demand has even enabled some fashion labels to reopen their factories,<strong> </strong>providing desperately needed supplies and, for some, self-expression amid chaos.</p> <p>Concern over the spread of coronavirus for months hasn\u2019t stopped Marie Lodi and her husband from exercising their love of kitsch.</p> <p>\u201cOur masks are really flamboyant and have hot pink tie-dye and Guy Fieri flames on them,\u201d says Lodi, a fashion writer and host of Fishnet Flix, a podcast about costume design. \u201cBecause we said if we are living in a pandemic and have to wear masks, then we might as well have some fun.\u201d</p> <p>Rather than ape the sterility of increasingly unavailable standard masks, which before the crisis might have retailed for as little as <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190610012647/https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/walgreens-earloop-style-face-mask/ID=prod6272763-product\">$0.44</a> per single-use item, the ones sold by indie designers and larger brands have playful styles fit for a public health crisis and springtime looks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f4ed2a6910a81ad4f750bb4e57434e14c120f54e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4ed2a6910a81ad4f750bb4e57434e14c120f54e/0_0_2016_1512/1000..jpg\" alt=\"The mask with Guy Fieri flames.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The mask with Guy Fieri flames.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marie Lodi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://matrushka.com/product/cotton-face-mask/\">Matrushka</a>\u2019s $10 cotton masks, constructed out of fabric scraps from its couture studio, are colorful creations with aliens and cartoon cats front and center. \u201cIf having a cool non-medical grade mask with cats or unicorns or sharks on it makes things less scary [for all of us], I\u2019m happy,\u201d says Laura Howe, the brand\u2019s owner and designer. \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of us all looking the same: sad, scared, behind the same kind of mask.\u201d</p> <p>Men\u2019s sporting gear retailer Ball and Buck is selling a <a href=\"https://ballandbuck.com/products/ball-and-buck-original-camo-mask?variant=32183015145565\">camo print face mask</a>. Maison Modulare has sold out of their <a href=\"https://modulare.us/products/ivory-lace-mask\">French lace mask</a>, a more expensive item priced at $60. Los Angeles Apparel, the successor to American Apparel, is offering FACEMASK3, a three-pack of masks made of French Terry fabric, available in nine colors.</p> <p>\u201cI felt like this is what I\u2019d been training for,\u201d says Grisel Lopez, a <a href=\"https://www.papermag.com/possessed-covid-masks-2645574726.html\">designer for Possessed</a>, fetishwear line which produces neon-colored PVC masks that can be sanitized.</p> <p>\u201cThe government is not stepping up,\u201d adds MI Leggett, founder of Official Rebrand, which uses upcycled materials. \u201cMaking masks is something I had to do.\u201d</p> <p>Major brands such as <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-and-off-the-avenue/how-christian-siriano-turned-his-fashion-house-into-a-mask-factory\">Christian Siriano</a>, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2020-03-24/fashion-brands-face-masks-medical-surgical-gowns-coronavirus\">Zara, H&amp;M and Prada</a> are using their factories to produce necessities solely for medical staff. Some smaller companies have one-for-one initiatives: for each mask sold, they donate another to essential workers. After the CDC released its new guidelines, Naomi Mishkin, owner of Naomi Nomi, says she has received 5,000 orders for her cotton masks, meaning the same number will go to first responders. Like many indie designers, she has been able to re-open her factory and get her team back to work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"da38513f100aefb33a4340e1d964b0fd801bb62d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da38513f100aefb33a4340e1d964b0fd801bb62d/0_415_1529_1495/1000..jpg\" alt=\"One of the Maison Modulare masks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"978\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the Maison Modulare masks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maison Modulare</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cFashion brands who have been able to pivot to making masks right now are crucial,\u201d says Marie Lodi. \u201cEveryone benefits: the brands who are losing money, the healthcare workers, and the civilians who are in need of masks.\u201d</p> <p>Yet, as is the case when any moral effort is commodified, some who are familiar with the fashion industry have concerns.</p> <p>\u201cAs the pandemic continues to spread, I anticipate that some high-end brands might charge higher prices [for masks] and capitalize on the fact that people are scared,\u201d says Gianluca Russo, a style reporter for Teen Vogue.</p> <p>There are also sustainability issues plaguing fast fashion manufacturers, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/18/fast-fashion-environmental-audit-committee-polluting-industry\">environmental harm</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/jun/05/female-garment-workers-gap-hm-south-asia\">labor abuses</a>.

  "<p>Good evening, and welcome to our daily roundup of the latest developments in the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Ben Doherty bringing you the main stories on Tuesday 7 April.</p> <h2>Australia\u2019s death toll reaches 48</h2> <p>Australia\u2019s Covid-19 death toll has reached 48, following two deaths in Western Australia and one in Tasmania.</p> <p>A woman in her 70s, who recently returned from overseas and was staying in a Perth hotel as a part of mandatory quarantine, died at the Royal Perth hospital. A man in his 70s, who was a passenger on the Artania cruise ship, died at Joondalup health campus.</p> <p>In Tasmania, a man in his 80s, yet another passenger on the ill-fated Ruby Princess cruise ship, died. That ship is now the original source of more than 660 infections, and at least 13 deaths. A criminal investigation is under way by New South Wales police into how it was allowed to dock at Circular Quay and its passengers disembark when there were signs of Covid-19 onboard.</p> <p>Also on Tuesday, the government released modelling on the potential curve of Australia\u2019s Covid-19 spread.</p> <p>The prime minister, Scott Morrison, stressed the modelling was theoretical and was not based on case data. It does not predict what will happen in Australia in terms of how many people will contract the virus or will die from the virus, or how long it will last in Australia.</p> <p>The modelling, he said, drew on a broader international dataset, and bolstered\u200b the rationale behind \u2018flattening the curve\u2019: which is what Australia is seeing now as a result of its interventions (particularly border closures) with a steady reduction in the number of new infections each day.</p> <p>The interventions were \u201ccontrolling the spread, boosting the capacity of our health system, and buying time, giving us the opportunity for more choices\u201d, Morrison said.</p> <p>The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, reported there were 5,844 confirmed cases of Covid-19, fewer than 100 people in ICUs and fewer than 40 people on ventilators.</p> <p>The major concern for state and federal health bodies was 500 community transmissions where authorities do not know the source of the infection.</p> <p>\u201cThat is why we cannot relax what we have been doing,\u201d Murphy said.</p> <h2>Crisis takes staggering toll on Australian business</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/07/coronavirus-crisis-has-had-staggering-impact-on-australian-businesses-data-reveals\">The Covid-19 pandemic has forced a staggering 70% of businesses in the hospitality sector to reduce the hours of their staff</a> and 43% to either sack workers or place them on unpaid leave, new data shows.</p> <p>The Australian Bureau of Statistics has <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/5676.0.55.003Main%20Features1Week%20Commencing%2030%20March%202020?opendocument&amp;tabname=Summary&amp;prodno=5676.0.55.003&amp;issue=Week%20Commencing%2030%20March%202020&amp;num=&amp;view=\">released new data</a> showing the pandemic\u2019s impact on business, based on a survey of 3,000 companies in the days after the government\u2019s tough <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/07/social-distancing-rules-australia-coronavirus-strict-new-laws-legal-illegal-state-physical-restrictions-guidelines-explained-nsw-victoria-qld-queensland-act-sa-wa-two-person-rule\">social distancing restrictions</a> were announced on 29 March.</p> <p>Two-thirds of businesses across all sectors reported taking a hit to revenue or cash flow due to Covid-19.</p> <p>Roughly the same number reported they had suffered decreased demand.</p> <p>Two in five businesses said they had changed how they delivered goods or services, one-third said they had renegotiated their leases, and one in four had deferred loan repayments.</p> <p>About one in 10 said they had paused trading altogether.

Detection of the disease in camps in Malakasa and Ritsona \u2013 among 30 refugee facilities on the mainland \u2013 has put them in uncharted territory. Malakasa was placed in quarantine on Sunday, hours after an Afghan refugee began displaying symptoms of the virus; Ritsona, 75km north-east of the capital, was sealed off after 23 African asylum seekers tested positive on Thursday.</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian after ordering the first lockdown, Manos Logothetis, the migration ministry\u2019s general secretary in charge of asylum seekers\u2019 reception, said: \u201cIt\u2019s the first case of coronavirus in a reception centre and, yes, we are testing our responses. We\u2019ve quarantined the entire area and taken steps to isolate those with the virus. It\u2019s not been easy, there\u2019ve been protests.</p> <p>\u201cFood has been brought by the International Organization for Migration, which is running the site, along with translators and cultural mediators. Testing will continue.\u201d</p> <p>The outbreak was traced to a 19-year-old Cameroonian woman found to be infected after giving birth in an Athens hospital.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b9d3897f71e6bfc39efb033709d4b901010fc80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b9d3897f71e6bfc39efb033709d4b901010fc80/0_0_3543_2362/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Members of the IOM and refugees unload boxes with food and medical supplies at the camp in Ritsona.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ritsona is relying on food handouts from the International Organization for Migration.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yannis Kolesidis/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAll the rest who have tested positive are asymptomatic,\u201d said Logothetis, a doctor himself. \u201cI found that surprising, but as in all the camps Ritsona\u2019s population is young. Most are under the age of 40 which is why we believe they\u2019ll be able to ride this out.\u201d</p> <p>However, many disagree. A surge in migrants from Turkey, even before the epidemic arrived in Europe, had increased concerns over the cramped and unsanitary conditions of reception centres in Greece.</p> <p>Increasingly, NGOs have voiced fears over lack of access to testing, medical facilities and basic services, including water stations and taps. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/eu-urged-to-evacuate-asylum-seekers-from-cramped-greek-island-camps-coronavirus\">Calls for the evacuation</a> of refugees to other EU countries have also soared amid evidence of the devastating effect coronavirus is likely to have on an already vulnerable population.</p> <p>Holding facilities on the mainland are generally managed better; refugees are accommodated in containers and pre-fab houses, in stark contrast to the tent cities on the Aegean isles that have long borne the brunt of the migrant and refugee crisis.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not a matter of \u2018if\u2019 but \u2018when\u2019 coronavirus strikes the camps,\u201d said Sanne van der Kooij, a Dutch gynaecologist who has similarly volunteered in Moria multiple times. \u201cI do not have a good feeling. I was last in Lesbos in February and worked at the local hospital where pregnant refugee women are moved to give birth. There were only six ICU beds and the care was very poor. The bed linens were filthy and the Greek doctors and nurses were clearly overwhelmed by the extra work.\u201d</p> <p>Although so far confirmed coronavirus cases have been reported only among local people on Lesbos, refugees requiring emergency medical help run the risk of contracting the virus, she said. \u201cIn the hospital for example. That\u2019s where so many will be at threat of coronavirus infection. And then the spread inside [the facility] will be very difficult to stop.\u201d</p> <p>Most asylum seekers in the island camps are from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and Africa. Unable to leave because of a <a href=\"https://www.msf.org/eu-turkey-deal-continues-cycle-containment-and-despair-greece-refugees\">containment policy </a>determined by the EU, they have found themselves in limbo, trapped on the outposts opposite the Turkish coast until their asylum requests are processed.</p> <p>Almost 35,000 European health workers and other citizens have also backed the doctors\u2019 petition calling on EU governments to comply with an accord struck with Turkey in 2016 under which each member state agreed to take in a fixed number of refugees. Although it is central to a pact aimed at curbing migratory flows, the resettlement pledge was never fulfilled.</p> <p>Greece has, so far, had relative success in keeping transmission of the disease under control, announcing fewer than 2,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and a death toll of 76.</p> <p>But health officials warn that the coming weeks are critical.</p> <p>\u201cThe EU will have blood on its hands if it continues to look away,\u201d warned De Vijver, speaking from Amsterdam where most of his patients in the city\u2019s main hospital are now suffering from coronavirus.</p> <p>\u201cThere are 22,000 people in Moria: men, women and children all packed into an area that is a fraction of the size of Hyde Park. Scabies, pneumonia, diarrhoea are rife,\u201d he said, adding that conditions had deteriorated markedly since NGOs and volunteer medics had left the island following violent attacks by far-right vigilantes last month.</p> <p>\u201cI was astounded to see that this terrible situation had caused 80% of the complaints we were dealing with. Politicians in the EU have a moral obligation to take these people in,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Greece\u2019s centre-right government has described the camps as \u201cticking health bombs\u201d.</p> <p>So far this year about 10,000 asylum seekers have been moved from the islands to the mainland \u2013 including 1,785 to closed, pre-deportation centres \u2013 according to the UN refugee agency. Plans are afoot to transfer another 600 people \u2013 300 elderly refugees and their dependents \u2013 to hotels in Athens. </p> <p>Reflecting restrictive measures enforced across Greece to combat Covid-19, authorities have allowed ATMs to be installed in the island facilities, as part of a wider lockdown on the camps.</p> <p>But Logothetis accepts that in the event of a \u201cmass coronavirus outbreak\u201d, health officials on Lesbos would be hard pushed to cope. \u201cIn an ideal world we would rent a big venue, keep it warm and kit it out with beds. That I hope will be the next phase of our emergency operational plan because with so few ICUs on the island we don\u2019t have the capacity to withstand the pressure if a lot of people were to get sick at the same time.\u201d</p> <p>The pandemic has effectively stopped any prospect of voluntary returns of migrants under a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/eu-to-offer-2000-to-migrants-willing-to-go-home-from-greek-islands\">EU-funded scheme </a>announced last month. Citing coronavirus concerns, the asylum service is also sputtering. Though operational again following Athens\u2019 suspension of applications in response to Turkey\u2019s abrupt decision to relax border controls and allow refugees to head to Europe, the service is not receiving new requests.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf6542e2b976148209439af962c2e67d6f913056\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf6542e2b976148209439af962c2e67d6f913056/0_0_4928_3280/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Migrants and refugees queue in a makeshift camp next to the Moria camp on the Greek island of Lesbos on 2 April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Doctors have warned about the consequences of a widespread outbreak in the island camps.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manolis Lagoutaris/AFP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hopes of resettling around 1,600 unaccompanied children to other parts of Europe have also dwindled. Officials say member states now want additional health checks, \u201cwhich will take time\u201d.</p> <p>With the spectre of gridlock, Athens has come under increased pressure from the EU to relocate asylum seekers to the mainland. But that, says Greece\u2019s migration minister Notis Mitarachi, is practically impossible without adequate accommodation.</p> <p>Addressing the EU parliament\u2019s home affairs committee as police moved to lock down Ritsona, he reiterated what prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has said repeatedly: Europe should do more to help because Greece \u201ccannot resolve this crisis instantly and alone\u201d.</p> <p>It is a refrain echoed by Logothetis. \u201cWe need support and we need to share the burden,\u201d he said. \u201cIf each of the other 26 EU member states agreed to take in 2,000 people, our problem would be more than settled.

  "<p>Disasters begin suddenly and never really end. The future will not, in crucial ways, be anything like the past, even the very recent past of a month or two ago. Our economy, our priorities, our perceptions will not be what they were at the outset of this year. The particulars are startling: companies such as GE and Ford retooling to make ventilators, the scramble for protective gear, once-bustling city streets becoming quiet and empty, the economy in freefall. Things that were supposed to be unstoppable stopped, and things that were supposed to be impossible \u2013 extending workers\u2019 rights and benefits, freeing prisoners, moving a few trillion dollars around in the US \u2013 have already happened.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/apr/27/rebecca-solnit-impossible-has-already-happened-coronavirus-hope-podcast\">'The impossible has already happened': what coronavirus can teach us about hope' \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The word \u201ccrisis\u201d means, in medical terms, the crossroads a patient reaches, the point at which she will either take the road to recovery or to death. The word \u201cemergency\u201d comes from \u201cemergence\u201d or \u201cemerge\u201d, as if you were ejected from the familiar and urgently need to reorient. The word \u201ccatastrophe\u201d comes from a root meaning a sudden overturning.</p> <p>We have reached a crossroads, we have emerged from what we assumed was normality, things have suddenly overturned. One of our main tasks now \u2013 especially those of us who are not sick, are not frontline workers, and are not dealing with other economic or housing difficulties \u2013 is to understand this moment, what it might require of us, and what it might make possible.</p> <p>A disaster (which originally meant \u201cill-starred\u201d, or \u201cunder a bad star\u201d) changes the world and our view of it. Our focus shifts, and what matters shifts. What is weak breaks under new pressure, what is strong holds, and what was hidden emerges. Change is not only possible, we are swept away by it. We ourselves change as our priorities shift, as intensified awareness of mortality makes us wake up to our own lives and the preciousness of life. Even our definition of \u201cwe\u201d might change as we are separated from schoolmates or co-workers, sharing this new reality with strangers. Our sense of self generally comes from the world around us, and right now, we are finding another version of who we are.</p> <p>As the pandemic upended our lives, people around me worried that they were having trouble focusing and being productive. It was, I suspected, because we were all doing other, more important work. When you\u2019re recovering from an illness, pregnant or young and undergoing a growth spurt, you\u2019re working all the time, especially when it appears you\u2019re doing nothing. Your body is growing, healing, making, transforming and labouring below the threshold of consciousness. As we struggled to learn the science and statistics of this terrible scourge, our psyches were doing something equivalent. We were adjusting to the profound social and economic changes, studying the lessons disasters teach, equipping ourselves for an unanticipated world.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The first lesson a disaster teaches is that everything is connected. In fact, disasters, I found while living through a medium-sized one (the 1989 earthquake in the San Francisco Bay Area) and later writing about major ones (including 9/11, Hurricane Katrina and the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/24/the-school-beneath-the-wave-the-unimaginable-tragedy-of-japans-tsunami\" title=\"\">Fukushima nuclear catastrophe</a> in Japan), are crash courses in those connections. At moments of immense change, we see with new clarity the systems \u2013 political, economic, social, ecological \u2013 in which we are immersed as they change around us. We see what\u2019s strong, what\u2019s weak, what\u2019s corrupt, what matters and what doesn\u2019t.</p> <p>I often think of these times as akin to a spring thaw: it\u2019s as if the pack ice has broken up, the water starts flowing again and boats can move through places they could not during winter. The ice was the arrangement of power relations that we call the status quo \u2013 it seems to be stable, and those who benefit from it often insist that it\u2019s unchangeable. Then it changes fast and dramatically, and that can be exhilarating, terrifying, or both.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"da770de80664c79144b58547c01984bf1a40bb45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da770de80664c79144b58547c01984bf1a40bb45/0_34_2000_1200/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Flooding in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina in September 2005.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flooding in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina in September 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Those who benefit most from the shattered status quo are often more focused on preserving or reestablishing it than protecting human life \u2013 as we saw when a chorus of US conservatives and corporate top dogs insisted that, for the sake of the stock market, everyone had to go back to work, and that the resultant deaths would be an acceptable price to pay. In a crisis, the powerful often try to seize more power \u2013 as they have in this round, with the Trump Department of Justice looking at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/donald-trump-coronavirus-emergency-powers-abuse\" title=\"\">suspending</a> constitutional rights \u2013 and the rich seek more riches: two Republican <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/20/republican-senators-sold-stocks-before-markets-plunged-on-coronavirus-fears-reports\" title=\"\">senators</a> are under fire for allegedly using inside information about the coming pandemic to make a profit in the stock market (although both have denied wrongdoing).</p> <p>Disaster scholars use the term \u201celite panic\u201d to describe the ways that elites react when they assume that ordinary people will behave badly. When elites describe \u201cpanic\u201d and \u201clooting\u201d in the streets, these are usually misnomers for ordinary people doing what they need to do to survive or care for others. Sometimes it\u2019s wise to move rapidly from danger; sometimes it\u2019s altruistic to gather supplies to share.</p> <p>Such elites often prioritise profit and property over human life and community. In the days after a huge earthquake struck San Francisco on 18 April 1906, the US military swarmed over the city, convinced that ordinary people were a threat and a source of disorder. The mayor issued a \u201cshoot to kill\u201d <a href=\"http://www.sfmuseum.org/1906.2/killproc.html\" title=\"\">proclamation</a> against looters, and the soldiers believed they were restoring order. What they were actually doing was setting inexpert firebreaks that helped fire spread through the city, and shooting or beating citizens who disobeyed orders (sometimes those orders were to let the fires burn down their own homes and neighbourhoods). Ninety-nine years later, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans\u2019s police and white vigilantes did the same thing: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/19/new-orleans-reaches-settlements-for-police-shootings-after-hurricane-katrina\" title=\"\">shooting black people</a> in the name of defending property and their own authority. The local, state and federal government insisted on treating a stranded, mostly poor, mostly black population as dangerous enemies to be contained and controlled, rather than victims of a catastrophe to be aided.</p> <p>The mainstream media colluded in obsessing about looting in the aftermath of Katrina. The stock of mass-manufactured goods in large corporate chain stores seemed to matter more than people needing food and clean water, or grandmothers left clinging to roofs. Nearly 1,500 people died of a disaster that had more to do with bad government than with bad weather. The US Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 levees <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/24/us/decade-after-katrina-pointing-finger-more-firmly-at-army-corps.html\" title=\"\">had failed</a>; the city had no evacuation plans for the poor, and President George W Bush\u2019s administration failed to deliver prompt and effective relief. The same calculus is happening now. A member of the Brazilian opposition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/tp-captain-corona\" title=\"\">said</a> of Brazil\u2019s rightwing president Jair Bolsonaro: \u201cHe represents the most perverse economic interests that couldn\u2019t care less about people\u2019s lives. They\u2019re worried about maintaining their profitability.\u201d (Bolsonaro claims he is trying to protect workers and the economy.)</p> <p>The billionaire evangelist who owns the arts and crafts chain Hobby Lobby claimed <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/hobby-lobby-reportedly-leaving-stores-open-message-from-god-2020-3\" title=\"\">divine guidance</a> in keeping his workers at their jobs when businesses were ordered to close. (The company has now <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Health/hobby-lobby-closes-stores-defying-coronavirus-stay-home/story?id=69975963\" title=\"\">closed</a> all its stores.) At Uline Corporation, owned by billionaire Trump backers Richard and Liz Uihlein, a <a href=\"about:blank\" title=\"\">memo</a> sent to Wisconsin workers said: \u201cplease do NOT tell your peers about the symptoms &amp; your assumptions. By doing so, you are causing unnecessary panic in the office.\u201d The billionaire founder and chairman of payroll processing corporation Paychex, Tom Golisano, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/29/bankers-trump-economy-coronavirus-deaths\" title=\"\">said</a>: \u201cThe damages of keeping the economy closed as it is could be worse than losing a few more people.\u201d (Golisano has since said his comments were misrepresented, and has apologised.)</p> <p>Historically, there have always been titans of industry who prized the lifeless thing that is profit over living beings, who paid bribes in order to operate unhindered, worked children to death or put labourers in mortal danger in sweatshops and coal mines. There were also those who pressed on with fossil fuel extraction and burning despite what they knew, or refused to know, about climate change. One of the primary uses of wealth has always been to buy your way out of the common fate, or, at least, it has come with a belief that you can disassociate from society at large. And while the rich are often conservative, conservatives more often align with the rich, whatever their economic status.</p> <p>The idea that everything is connected is an affront to conservatives who cherish a macho every-man-for-himself frontier fantasy. Climate change has been a huge insult to them \u2013 this science that says what comes out of our cars and chimneys shapes the fate of the world in the long run and affects crops, sea level, forest fires and so much more. If everything is connected, then the consequences of every choice and act and word have to be examined, which we see as love in action and they see as impingement upon absolute freedom, freedom being another word for absolutely no limits on the pursuit of self-interest. Ultimately, a significant portion of conservatives and corporate leaders regard science as an annoyance that they can refuse to recognise. Some insist they can choose whatever rules and facts they want, as though these too are just free-market commodities to pick and choose from or remake according to one\u2019s whims. \u201cThis denial of science and critical thinking among religious ultraconservatives now haunts the American response to the coronavirus crisis,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/opinion/coronavirus-trump-evangelicals.html?fbclid=IwAR1ChJXKIYTvBcrDKcjwU3UJJ6Dj1SeAbA82KPoTvRlYR2IphLKj8qZ_dzQ\" title=\"\">wrote</a> the journalist Katherine Stewart in the New York Times.</p> <p>Our rulers showed little willingness to recognise the ominous possibilities of the pandemic in the US, the UK, Brazil and many other countries. They failed in their most important job, and denying that failure will be a major focus for them. And while it may be inevitable that the pandemic will result in an economic crash, it is also turning into an opportunity for authoritarian power grabs in the Philippines, Hungary, Israel and the US \u2013 a reminder that the largest problems are still political, and so are their solutions.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>When a storm subsides, the air is washed clean of whatever particulate matter has been obscuring the view, and you can often see farther and more sharply than at any other time. When this storm clears, we may, as do people who have survived a serious illness or accident, see where we were and where we should go in a new light. We may feel free to pursue change in ways that seemed impossible while the ice of the status quo was locked up. We may have a profoundly different sense of ourselves, our communities, our systems of production and our future.</p> <p>For many of us in the developed world, what has changed most immediately is spatial. We have stayed home, those of us who have homes, and away from contact with others. We have withdrawn from schools, workplaces, conferences, vacations, gyms, errands, parties, bars, clubs, churches, mosques, synagogues, from the busyness and bustle of everyday life. The philosopher-mystic Simone Weil once wrote to a faraway friend: \u201cLet us love this distance, which is thoroughly woven with friendship, since those who do not love each other are not separated.\u201d We have withdrawn from each other to protect each other. And people have found ways to help the vulnerable, despite the need to remain physically distant.</p> <p>My friend Renato Redentor Constantino, a climate campaigner, wrote to me from the Philippines, and said: \u201cWe are witness today to daily displays of love that remind us of the many reasons why humans have survived this long. We encounter epic acts of courage and citizenship each day in our neighbourhoods and in other cities and countries, instances that whisper to us that the depredations of a few will eventually be overcome by legions of stubborn people who refuse the counsel of despair, violence, indifference and arrogance that so-called leaders appear so eager nowadays to trigger.\u201d</p> <p>When we are no longer trying to unlink ourselves from the chain of a spreading disease, I wonder if we will rethink how we were linked, how we moved about and how the goods we rely on moved about. Perhaps we will appreciate the value of direct face-to-face contact more. Perhaps the Europeans who have sung together from their balconies or applauded together for their medical workers, and the Americans who came out to sing or dance on their suburban blocks, will have a different sense of belonging. Perhaps we will find a new respect for the workers who produce our food and those who bring it to our tables.</p> <p>Although staying put is hard, maybe we will be reluctant to resume our rushing about, and something of the stillness now upon us will stay with us. We may rethink the wisdom of having much of our most vital stuff \u2013 medicine, medical equipment \u2013 made on other continents. We may also rethink the precarious just-in-time supply chains. I have often thought that the wave of privatisation that has characterised our neoliberal age began with the privatisation of the human heart, the withdrawal from a sense of a shared fate and social bonds. It is to be hoped that this shared experience of catastrophe will reverse the process. A new awareness of how each of us belongs to the whole and depends on it may strengthen the case for meaningful climate action, as we learn that sudden and profound change is possible after all.</p> <p>\u201cGetting and spending, we lay waste our powers,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45564/the-world-is-too-much-with-us\" title=\"\">Wordsworth wrote</a>, a little more than 200 years ago. Perhaps this will be the moment that we recognise that there is enough food, clothing, shelter, healthcare and education for all \u2013 and that access to these things should not depend on what job you do and whether you earn enough money. Perhaps the pandemic is also making the case, for those who were not already convinced, for universal healthcare and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/17/universal-basic-income-ideas-are-part-of-emergency-coronavirus-plan.html\" title=\"\">basic income</a>. In the aftermath of disaster, a change of consciousness and priorities are powerful forces.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8514068dadbb43f4e9b13f9cff3179e85b827f2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8514068dadbb43f4e9b13f9cff3179e85b827f2e/0_83_3202_2538/1000..jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It helped bring on the revolution\u2019 \u2026 damage from the earthquake that struck Managua in Nicaragua in 1972.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"793\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It helped bring on the revolution\u2019 \u2026 damage from the earthquake that struck Managua in Nicaragua in 1972.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A dozen years ago I interviewed the Nicaraguan poet and Sandinista revolutionary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/giocondabelli\" title=\"\">Gioconda Belli</a> for my book on disaster, A Paradise Built in Hell. What she told me about the aftermath of the 1972 earthquake in Managua \u2013 that, despite the dictatorship\u2019s crackdown, it helped bring on the revolution \u2013 was unforgettable. She said: \u201cYou had a sense of what was important. And people realised that what was important was freedom and being able to decide your life and agency. Two days later you had this tyrant imposing a curfew, imposing martial law. The sense of oppression on top of the catastrophe was really unbearable. And once you had realised that your life can be decided by one night of the Earth deciding to shake, [you thought]: \u2018So what? I want to live a good life and I want to risk my life, because I can also lose my life in one night.\u2019 You realise that life has to be lived well or is not worth living. It\u2019s a very profound transformation that takes place during catastrophes.\u201d</p> <p>I have found over and over that the proximity of death in shared calamity makes many people more urgently alive, less attached to the small things in life and more committed to the big ones, often including civil society or the common good.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>I have mostly written about 20th-century disasters, but one analogy a bit further back comes to mind: the Black Death, which wiped out a third of Europe\u2019s population, and, in England, later led to peasant revolts against war taxes and wage caps that were officially quashed, but nevertheless led to more rights and freedoms for peasants and labourers. In the emergency legislation passed in the US in March, many workers gained new sick-leave rights. Lots of things we were assured were impossible \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/coronavirus/oakland-hotels-housing-the-homeless-during-coronavirus-pandemic/2264355/\" title=\"\">housing the homeless</a>, for example \u2013 have come to pass in some places.</p> <p>Ireland nationalised its hospitals, something \u201cwe were told would never happen and could never happen,\u201d an Irish journalist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/newschambers/status/1242518486150197248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1242518486150197248&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.commondreams.org%2Fnews%2F2020%2F03%2F26%2Fireland-nationalizes-hospitals-duration-coronavirus\" title=\"\">commented</a>. Canada came up with <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-52022506\" title=\"\">four months of basic income</a> for those who lost their jobs. Germany did <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/europe/coronavirus-Berlin-self-employed.html\" title=\"\">more than that</a>. Portugal decided to treat immigrants and asylum seekers <a href=\"https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/news/portugal-grants-migrants-and-asylum-seekers-full-citizenship-rights-during-covid-19/\" title=\"\">as full citizens</a> during the pandemic. In the US, we have seen powerful labour agitation, and results. Workers at Whole Foods, Instacart and Amazon have protested at being forced to work in unsafe conditions during the pandemic. (Whole Foods has since offered workers who test positive two weeks off on full pay; Instacart says it has made changes to safeguard workers and shoppers, while Amazon said it is \u201cfollowing guidelines\u201d on safety.) Some workers have gained new rights and raises, including almost <a href=\"https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/coronavirus/kroger-grocery-worker-in-texas-receive-pay-raises-new-benefits-during-coronavirus-outbreak/2343540/\" title=\"\">half a million Kroger</a> grocery store workers, while 15 state attorneys-general <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/state-ags-tell-amazon-to-boost-paid-sick-leave-during-coronavirus-crisis/\" title=\"\">told Amazon</a> to expand its paid sick leave. These specifics make clear how possible it is to change the financial arrangements of all our societies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5079c808a2d8d1bc1ce0ce4a81c128ca4a575d93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5079c808a2d8d1bc1ce0ce4a81c128ca4a575d93/0_0_2455_2391/1000..jpg\" alt=\"The English peasants\u2019 revolt of 1381.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"974\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The English peasants\u2019 revolt of 1381.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But often the most significant consequences of disasters are not immediate or direct. The 2008 financial collapse led to 2011\u2019s Occupy Wall Street uprising, which prompted a new reckoning with economic inequality and a new scrutiny of the human impact of exploitative mortgages, student loans, for profit-colleges, health-insurance systems and more, and that in turn amplified the profiles of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, whose ideas have helped pull the Democratic party to the left, towards policies that will make the US fairer and more equal. The conversations stirred by Occupy and its sister movements across the globe incited more critical scrutiny of ruling powers, and more demands for economic justice. Changes in the public sphere originate within the individual, but also, changes in the world at large affect our sense of self, our priorities and our sense of the possible.</p> <p>We are only in the early stages of this disaster, and we are also in a strange stillness. It is like the Christmas truce of 1914, when German and English soldiers stopped fighting for a day, the guns fell silent and soldiers mingled freely. War itself paused. There\u2019s a way that our getting and spending has been a kind of war against the Earth. Since the outbreak of Covid-19, carbon emissions have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/23/coronavirus-pandemic-leading-to-huge-drop-in-air-pollution\" title=\"\">plummeted</a>. Reports say the air above Los Angeles, Beijing and New Delhi is miraculously clean. Parks all over the US are shut to visitors, which may have a beneficial effect on wildlife. In the last government shutdown of 2018-2019, elephant seals at Point Reyes National Seashore just north of San Francisco <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-elephant-seals-point-reyes-20190523-story.html\" title=\"\">took over a new beach</a>, and now own it for the duration of their season of mating and birthing on land.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>There\u2019s another analogy that comes to mind. When a caterpillar enters its chrysalis, it dissolves itself, quite literally, into liquid. In this state, what was a caterpillar and will be a butterfly is neither one nor the other, it\u2019s a sort of living soup. Within this living soup are the imaginal cells that will catalyse its transformation into winged maturity. May the best among us, the most visionary, the most inclusive, be the imaginal cells \u2013 for now we are in the soup. The outcome of disasters is not foreordained. It\u2019s a conflict, one that takes place while things that were frozen, solid and locked up have become open and fluid \u2013 full of both the best and worst possibilities. We are both becalmed and in a state of profound change.</p> <p>But this is also a time of depth for those spending more time at home and more time alone, looking outward at this unanticipated world. We often divide emotions into good and bad, happy and sad, but I think they can equally be divided into shallow and deep, and the pursuit of what is supposed to be happiness is often a flight from depth, from one\u2019s own interior life and the suffering around us \u2013 and not being happy is often framed as a failure. But there is meaning as well as pain in sadness, mourning and grief, the emotions born of empathy and solidarity. If you are sad and frightened, it is a sign that you care, that you are connected in spirit. If you are overwhelmed \u2013 well, it is overwhelming, and it will take decades of study, analysis, discussion and contemplation to understand how and why 2020 suddenly took us all into marshy new territory.</p> <p>Seven years ago, Patrisse Cullors wrote a sort of mission statement for Black Lives Matter: \u201cProvide hope and inspiration for collective action to build collective power to achieve collective transformation. Rooted in grief and rage but pointed towards vision and dreams.\u201d It is beautiful not only because it is hopeful, not only because then Black Lives Matter set out and did transformative work, but because it acknowledges that hope can coexist with difficulty and suffering. The sadness in the depths and the fury that burns above are not incompatible with hope, because we are complex creatures, because hope is not optimism that everything will be fine regardless.</p> <p>Hope offers us clarity that, amid the uncertainty ahead, there will be conflicts worth joining and the possibility of winning some of them. And one of the things most dangerous to this hope is the lapse into believing that everything was fine before disaster struck, and that all we need to do is return to things as they were. Ordinary life before the pandemic was already a catastrophe of desperation and exclusion for too many human beings, an environmental and climate catastrophe, an obscenity of inequality. It is too soon to know what will emerge from this emergency, but not too soon to start looking for chances to help decide it. It is, I believe, what many of us are preparing to do.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",

It was a nice conversation. We talked about pretty much this [coronavirus].</p> \n  <p>\u201cHe gave me his point of view, and I fully understood that, and we just had a very friendly conversation. It lasted probably 15 minutes and it was really good, really nice. So I appreciated his calling.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Trump was asked by Jon Karl of ABC News if Biden offered any specific advice on handling the crisis. \u201cWe agreed that we weren\u2019t going to talk about what we said,\u201d he said. \u201cHe had suggestions. It doesn\u2019t mean that I agree with those suggestions.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The soft tone was all the more striking because Trump was on irascible form with reporters. At one point he lambasted Karl, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/04/front-row-at-the-trump-show-jonathan-karl-book\">whom he has known for 26 years</a>, \u201cYou\u2019re a third rate reporter \u2026 You will never make it!\u201d</p> \n  <p>The president was asked if he would now make contact with predecessors Barack Obama or George W Bush to seek their advice. He will not.</p> \n  <p>And the d\u00e9tente did not last. Later in the briefing, Trump made spurious claims about the Obama-Biden\u2019s handling of swine flu and failure to stockpile equipment. Biden, meanwhile,<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1247296778095005696?s=20\"> tweeted:</a> \u201cFor months, I called on President Trump to step up and take the action necessary to combat COVID-19.

The deadline for election officials to receive the ballot is 13 April. The decision, which came shortly after the <a href=\"https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2020%2Fapr%2F06%2Fwisconsin-primary-election-in-person-voting-coronavirus\">state supreme court</a> ordered the election to move forward on Tuesday, ends days of legal fighting over the deadline for receiving absentee ballots in the state. </p> \n  <p>State law requires them to be received at election offices by 8pm on election night in order to count, but a federal judge extended that deadline to 13 April amid an unprecedented surge in requests for mail-in balloting. There was such a surge in requests that state Democrats argued thousands would be disenfranchised because they wouldn\u2019t even get their ballot until after election day. As of Monday morning, a little over 11,000 voters who had requested a ballot in the state had yet to be issued one. In an unsigned opinion, the five conservative justices on the court said it was ruling on a \u201cnarrow, technical question\u201d, and that the lower court\u2019s decision to extend the ballot deadline without requiring a postmark went beyond what plaintiffs had asked for.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe court\u2019s decision on the narrow question before the court should not be viewed as expressing an opinion on the broader question of whether to hold the election, or whether other reforms or modifications in election procedures in light of Covid\u201319 are appropriate,\u201d the majority wrote.
