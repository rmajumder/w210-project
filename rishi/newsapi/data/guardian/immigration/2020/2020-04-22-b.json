  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Global death toll exceeds 180,000</h2> <p>More than 2.6 million people have been infected and at least 182,992 have died since the outbreak began, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University.</p> <p>The figures, which are based on official releases and media reports, are likely to represent a significant underestimate due to suspected underreporting by national governments and differing testing regimes.</p> <h2>Ethnic minorities overrepresented in death toll, analysis shows</h2> <p>The UK government is being urged to recognise that race and racial inequalities are risk factors for Covid-19, as Guardian research reveals that people from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/racial-inequality-in-britain-found-a-risk-factor-for-covid-19\">ethnic minorities in England are dying in disproportionately high numbers</a> compared with white people.</p> <h2>Italy\u2019s death rate decelerates</h2> <p>The country <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/22/coronavirus-live-news-un-warns-of-biblical-famine-as-white-house-prepares-immigration-halt?page=with:block-5ea06ed08f084784dca580b6#block-5ea06ed08f084784dca580b6\">reports that 437 more people died on Tuesday</a>; 97 fewer than on Monday.

  "<p>David Moyes was wandering around his local food shop when he spotted a chance to help people affected by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/22/coronavirus-live-news-un-warns-of-biblical-famine-as-white-house-prepares-immigration-halt\" title=\"\">the coronavirus pandemic</a>. \u201cThere was a thing up in the window that said drivers needed,\u201d West Ham\u2019s manager says. \u201cI volunteered to do it as my wife was away at the time and I was on my own. So I became a fruit and veg driver.\u201d</p> <p>Moyes, who left London for his family home in Lancashire a few weeks ago, makes sure to point out he respected the physical distancing rules during his four days behind the wheel. There were no autographs or conversations on the doorstep. One couple recognised the famous football manager delivering their shopping \u2013 \u201cYou could hear them say \u2018David Moyes?!\u2019\u201d \u2013 but the Scot was not doing it for acclaim. It was just his way of helping out while he is staying in Lytham and, anyway, he quite enjoyed his temporary career change.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/22/premier-league-clubs-discussing-early-end-to-season-amid-growing-concerns-health-safety-covid-19\">Premier League clubs discussing early end to season amid growing concerns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt was beautiful big boxes of fruit and veg, really colourful. I was enjoying it, going back to the shop to get another lot and then filling the car up. Two of my pals who I go out for drinks with now and again were giving me dog\u2019s abuse and WhatsApping me saying: \u2018Have you delivered your fruit and veg yet?\u2019 I ended up having to deliver two big boxes to my pals.\u201d</p> <p>There were perks to the jobs as well. One ride even made Moyes some money on the side. \u201cI think it was \u00a316.80, one box of fruit and veg. She gave me a \u00a320 note and said: \u2018Here son, just keep the change.\u2019 It was an older lady. The tip!\u201d</p> <p>Moyes is in good spirits, even though he is missing football. The suspension of the season means he has more free time than usual.</p> <p>\u201cMy wife was away so it was me who had to do the cooking. If the wife had been here, she would have told me I was doing it wrong. Trial and error.</p> <p>\u201cMy wife is in the background now, giving me all sorts of signs. Overall, my cooking is just about average at best. I\u2019ve been putting salmon in the oven and been cooking haddock and monkfish and all sorts of different things. I\u2019ve been at the fish shop quite a bit. I wouldn\u2019t say I was a dab hand. But it\u2019s edible.\u201d</p> <p>Moyes, who has taken a 30% pay cut on his \u00a32m-a-year salary, knows there are more important things than football. Conscious of the need to help vulnerable people, he recently cheered up an 85-year-old woman who has recovered from coronavirus by giving her a call.</p> <p>\u201cIris was an older lady who lives on her own. She was great. She has one or two other problems to deal with regarding her other medications but she was really good, telling me about the support she has been getting from other people at West Ham. They have been phoning her, sending her letters. We have said that when the football starts up again we\u2019ll pick her up in a taxi, bring her to a game and take her back as well.\u201d</p> <p>Moyes is in touch with reality. He has been preparing for football\u2019s eventual return by analysing old games and watching clips of transfer targets, but he is worried about the fate of Football League clubs and the game\u2019s parlous financial state. \u201cWe hope football will have a little reset. I hope we\u2019ll all look back and think: \u2018Maybe we were indulging too much.\u2019 The people who run football clubs have got to say: \u2018Have we always been doing the right things? If anything like this happened again in the future, would we be able to get through it?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cMaybe we have to look at the prices paid for players. We might need to look at the wages. We might need to look at what\u2019s been paid to agents. We might need to look at all different aspects of the industry. We\u2019ve still got a long way to go to make sure we get out of this situation we\u2019re in. How we come out of it, I\u2019m not sure. We have to make sure that all football clubs are saved.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The dew point is the temperature at which a certain area of air must be cooled to for dew to form. It is also commonly interpreted as a measure of the air\u2019s moisture content. As air cools, the amount of the gaseous form of water it is capable of holding decreases, and as such, cooling will eventually result in it reaching saturation point, beyond which condensation into liquid water droplets occurs. This is the main process behind cloud formation in the atmosphere.</p> <p>Of course, dew can also form on surfaces on earth. When the surface (for example grass or cars) cools below the dew point temperature of the air adjacent, condensation droplets from the air deposit onto that surface. If surface temperatures fall below 0C and below the dew point temperature, instead of water vapour gas condensing to water droplets, it transitions directly to crystals of ice, in the form of frost.</p> <p>While frost formation in winter months is rather common, surface temperatures in autumn or in spring are less likely to fall down to the air\u2019s dew point, aided by the shorter overnight cooling periods. Hence, dew and frost do not form as readily, especially on objects which can have larger stores of heat in them, such as roads.</p>",
  "<p>Earth Day demonstrations scrapped due to the coronavirus pandemic are being replaced with digital activism via the online gaming community to exploit an as yet untapped audience for action against climate change.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.earthday.org/earth-day-2020/\">Earth Day, 22 April 2020</a>, had been years in the planning but the large global demonstrations to mark the event\u2019s 50th anniversary were brought to a halt by Covid-19. In a swift pivot from the physical action which was to have been spearheaded by half a million people gathering in Washington DC, organisers sent their movement into the digital sphere.</p> <p>In an attempt to capture huge audiences they have collaborated with the online gaming community, sending messages about the need to tackle climate change.</p> <p>This week, the two million people who play the digital card game Solitaire Grand Harvest were greeted with climate messages and additional games designed to spur players into thinking about ways they could help the environment. The game already has a \u201cgreen\u201d tinge: players grow virtual plants and harvest crops on a \u201cfarm\u201d in its challenges.</p> <p>Jillian Semaan, food and environment director at the Earth Day network, said: \u201cWe had to completely change what we were doing to mark the day, and this seemed like a natural fit with Solitaire Grand Harvest and something we were really excited about.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9d2215a908b9ace4295ff8046f98d694331267b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9d2215a908b9ace4295ff8046f98d694331267b/311_662_5215_3131/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Covid-19 masks at an Earth Day event in Seoul, South Korea, linking ecosystem destruction to the root causes of the coronavirus pandemic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Covid-19 masks at an Earth Day event in Seoul, South Korea, linking ecosystem destruction to the root causes of the coronavirus pandemic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jung Yeon-Je/AF/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis is the first time we have reached out through the gaming world.

It would therefore be \u201cwholly unrealistic\u201d to think that restrictions would be relaxed any time soon and some \u201cvery socially disruptive\u201d measures would almost certainly have to remain in force for the rest of the year, he said. Whitty added that coronavirus was not going to be eradicated, so we must accept we will be working with it globally for the foreseeable future.</li> \n   <li><strong>We are at the peak of the outbreak, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, told the Commons. </strong>But this was put into further perspective by Chris Whitty at the press briefing, who highlighted that the peak was an \u201cartificial peak\u201d as it was the result of the lockdown. The first secretary of state, Dominic Raab, also reiterated that the biggest risk was a second spike. This all reinforces that an \u201cexit strategy\u201d from physical distancing measures is proving more and more difficult to devise.</li> \n   <li><strong>A contact-tracing system will be in place \u201cin a matter of weeks\u201d, Hancock also said.</strong> He said the effectiveness of \u201ctest, track and trace\u201d every new case as a method rested on the incidence of transmission in the community.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UK\u2019s hospital death toll surpassed 18,000, as a further 759 deaths took the total to 18,100.</strong> The ONS said there had also been 1,043 coronavirus-related deaths in care homes in England and Wales by 10 April. In a joint statement with the CQC, the government conceded that the true number \u201ccould be double\u201d. Chris Whitty also said he thought the ONS figures were \u201can underestimate\u201d. And analysis from the Financial Times suggested the real UK death toll could be as high as 41,000.</li> \n   <li><strong>The EU denied the UK government\u2019s claim that a mix-up was to blame for its non-involvement in its coronavirus procurement scheme.</strong> The European commission said the UK was well aware of the initiative when it decided not to participate, contradicting the government\u2019s claim that it didn\u2019t get involved because of a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d about eligibility. Facing questions from the Commons foreign affairs committee, Sir Simon McDonald, the head of the Foreign Office, said it was a \u201cpolitical decision\u201d, though he later issued a retraction and said non-involvement had been due to a \u201ccommunication problem\u201d. </li> \n   <li><strong>The Welsh government is to fund free \u201cschool meals\u201d for disadvantaged children during the summer holidays.</strong> It is the first UK nation to make such a pledge.</li> \n   <li><strong>And the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, urged the government to ban evictions over rent arrears built up as a result of the coronavirus crisis.</strong> He also called for an increase in housing benefits and that the government should cover, for the duration of the crisis, any shortfall in payments by private renters.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Thank you so much to everyone who got in touch throughout the day with news tips, suggestions, comments and advice.</p> \n  <p>That\u2019s it from us on the UK side, we\u2019ll be back tomorrow to bring you all the latest updates on the pandemic.

He went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>But there is a long path between having a vaccine that\u2019s proof of concept, and until we have either a vaccine or a drug ... what we will have available to us are social measures.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the government could not allow the R number, the reproduction number (the rate at which the virus spreads), to get above 1 for any extended period of time.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We cannot allow R, the force of transmission, to go above one for any extended period at any point because, if it does, exponential growth of this will continue, it\u2019ll resume and we will get back to a situation where the NHS could have its emergency services overwhelmed. It does not take very long from where you get from bad numbers to really bad numbers ...</p> \n   <p>What we are trying to work out is what are the things that add up to an R of less than one.

What we need to look at, in these data and other data, if we want to get a true picture, is - and I\u2019ve said this right from the beginning - is the all-cause, seasonally adjusted mortality over time. </p> \n   <p>And that is because, as I\u2019ve said here before, deaths from Covid will be a combination of direct deaths from the virus, and also indirect deaths, if for example people are nervous about going into hospital. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said coronavirus was peaking, but that it was an \u201cartificial peak\u201d, because it was the product of the lockdown.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that the public should not expect the number of Covid-19 deaths to \u201cfall away\u201d suddenly.</strong> As he presented a new graph (see below) he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is important for people to fully understand that ... even in those countries which started their epidemic curve earlier than in the UK, and which are still ahead, the downward slope from the point which we change is a relatively slow one.</p> \n   <p>We should anticipate the same situation in the UK.

But the government did not implement that for another three and a half weeks, he said. He said that showed the government was not following scientific advice - a claim <strong>Dominic Raab,</strong> the foreign secretary and first secretary of state rejected.</p> \n  <p>Gardiner was referring to <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/873723/03-potential-effect-of-non-pharmaceutical-interventions-npis-on-a-Covid-19-epidemic-in-the-UK.pdf\">this paper (pdf)</a>, one of several Sage papers published <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/scientific-advisory-group-for-emergencies-sage-coronavirus-covid-19-response\">in a batch</a> when the government was under pressure to reveal the scientific advice it was getting.</p> \n  <p>The document does indeed show that the government has failed to follow the scientific advice (or at least the advice set out by Sage in that 26 February). However, it shows the scientists arguing <em>against</em> the hard lockdown measures subsequently announced by Boris Johnson on 23 March.</p> \n  <p>Here is the key extract. (I\u2019ve added the bold type, to highlight the key passage.)</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In the event of a pandemic, without action, the NHS will be unable to meet all demands placed on it. Demand on beds is likely to overtake supply well before the peak is reached. Any interventions that could delay the peak, and/or reduce the size of the peak, whilst increasing the duration of the pandemic, are likely to be helpful, provided the pandemic is not extended into the late autumn/winter.</p> \n   <p>Any of the measures listed below could potentially flatten the peak of the epidemic and extend it to some extent. A combination of measures would be expected to have a greater impact, but the impacts are not strictly additive. SPI-M-O [the scientific pandemic influenza group on modelling] believes that combining all four measures, as a long-term policy, might have a similar impact to that seen in Hong Kong or mainland China - reducing the reproduction number to around 1. <strong>However, this would result in a large second epidemic once measures were lifted. Implementing a subset of measures (eg, the first three) would be expected to have a more moderate impact - still substantially reducing peak incidence, while making a second wave of infection in autumn less likely. This might be the preferred outcome for the NHS.</strong></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The four interventions were, in order: school closures; home isolation for people with symptoms; voluntary household quarantine when someone in a family has symptoms, and \u201csocial distancing\u201d (described as people reducing contacts outside the home and workplace by 75%).</p> \n  <p>The document does not call for any of these measures to be introduced immediately. And it stresses that ultimately what should happen is a \u201cpolitical decision\u201d, although the paragraph quoted above clearly implies that at that point the Sage scientists favoured measures 1 to 3, but not 4 (social distancing).</p> \n  <p>In the same document they argue that there might be advantages to allowing \u201cthe majority of the population ... [to] develop immunity, hopefully preventing any second wave, while reducing pressure on the NHS\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Johnson did reject this proposal. He abandoned \u201cherd immunity\u201d (the concept endorsed here) and opted for a hard lockdown that went much further than the \u201csocial distancing\u201d plan outlined in this document.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea067a78f08a1178d5afce0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/carolinedavies\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T15:52:49.244Z\">4.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Buckingham Palace</strong> has announced the postponement of investitures due to be held in June and that the annual Garter Day service at Windsor Castle has been cancelled.</p> \n  <p>In a statement, the palace said this was \u201cfor practical reasons in the current circumstances\u201d.

that means two-metre social distancing must be maintained at all times.</p> \n   <p>Contractors and clients also have a moral duty of care for workers from when they leave their home to when they return.</p> \n   <p>Construction workers should not be forced to use overcrowded public transport, potentially endangering their health and that of our key workers.</p> \n   <p>If our members believe

Snap verdict</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>That was Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s first outing as Labour leader at PMQs, but just as importantly this marked the debut for a whole new way of running this question session: a \u201chybrid\u201d system, with most MPs participating by Zoom. Both probably amount to a distinct improvement on what came before.</p> \n  <p>First, the process. On a technical level it mostly worked well. One MP did not manage to dial in in time, and another got cut off early. But overall it went smoothly.</p> \n  <p>More importantly, PMQs without 400-odd MPs in the chamber makes everything quieter, calmer, more intelligible and more grown-up. For once the proceedings sounded like the question time sessions that take place in the Scottish parliament and the Welsh assembly. Without the jeering and the aggro, it lacked gladiatorial edge, and frankly it was probably a bit more boring than the old PMQs. But boring is a much underrated virtue in governance. It will be be very interesting to see whether the Commons ever reverts to how it operated before when (or more probably if) this is all over.</p> \n  <p>In the old PMQs, MPs worked on the assumption that there was always a \u201cwinner\u201d. (Journalists like me wrote it up in those terms too, because that was how the participants viewed the proceedings.) Under Zoom PMQs it is much harder to imagine anyone \u201cwinning\u201d old-style, but if Labour had to choose someone well-suited to parliament in serious/boring mode, it is hard to imagine anyone better than Starmer, and he will chalk today\u2019s outing up, not as a triumph, but certainly as a success. His questions were clear, forensic and focused, he avoided bland or trite sloganising and he adopted a measured tone consistent with responsible, constructive opposition. Quite what the public will make of this when the alternative is Boris Johnson remains to be seen, but high-grade seriousness is what Starmer offered in the Labour leadership contest and it is what he delivered today.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T13:11:18.364Z\">at 2.11pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea02e288f0898fe360d5f5e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T11:46:25.468Z\">12.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Deaths in Scotland rise by 77 to 1,062</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A total of 1,062 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for Covid-19, up by 77 from 985 on Tuesday, the first minister, <strong>Nicola Sturgeon,</strong> said.</p> \n  <p>The figures are lower than the 1,616 deaths given earlier by the National Records of Scotland <em>(see 12.22pm)</em> as they do not include suspected and probable coronavirus infections.</p> \n  <p>Sturgeon said 9,038 people had now tested positive for the virus in Scotland, up by 366 from 8,672 the day before.</p> \n  <p>There were 155 people in intensive care with coronavirus or coronavirus symptoms, a decrease of 11 from Tuesday, she added.</p> \n  <p>There were 1,776 people in hospital with confirmed or suspected Covid-19, down from 1,866 yesterday.</p> \n  <p>And since 5 March, 1,813 patients who tested positive have been discharged from hospital.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T12:06:53.856Z\">at 1.06pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea02c0d8f084784dca57d77\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T11:36:44.820Z\">12.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>James Sunderland,</strong> a Conservative, asks Raab what are the ingredients that will take the country through this.</p> \n  <p>Raab says the critical ingredient is for the country to come together.

It\u2019s confusing and frightening and raises serious concerns about how the Home Office communicates and shares vital information.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople can\u2019t stay in hotels forever.

We\u2019re also really concerned that people in hotels are not receiving cash support that\u2019s needed for phone top-ups and other essentials.\u201d</p> \n<p>The vast majority of those moved are either new arrivals, some of whom have been in the system for months awaiting decisions on their substantive asylum claim, or those who cannot return to their county of origin because of the pandemic. They were previously receiving financial support either in cash or through a payment card.</p> \n<p>A Mears spokesperson said lockdown measures had severely limited the company\u2019s capacity to utilise short-term let accommodation for new asylum applicants.</p> \n<p>They said: \u201cTherefore we had no alternative but to procure hotel space where we can safely and appropriately house and support each person with food and health services without restriction on time of residence. </p> \n<p>\u201cAll movement of the people concerned was undertaken in accordance with health authority guidance on social distancing and use of PPE. The safety and wellbeing of each person is paramount and Mears are working hard to ensure we meet all obligations at this very difficult time.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Home Office said that accommodation would be reviewed \u201cprior to the end of June\u201d. </p>",

It has consciously decided that those in Australia on temporary visas are undeserving of support.</p> \n<p>There are far stronger arguments why Australia should take a broader view of who is \u201cAustralian\u201d, who are members of this community and who should be afforded this community\u2019s protection.</p> \n<p>First is the humanitarian imperative.</p> \n<p>These are extraordinary times.

There exists an obligation to offer some measure of assistance to people in this country in a time of unprecedented crisis.</p> \n<p>The entreaties that people should \u201cmake their way home\u201d are politically alluring but simplistic and impractical. Many simply cannot: they cannot afford flights home; the borders of their country have been sealed shut \u2013 even to citizens; transit countries will not allow them to pass through; or they have come to Australia seeking protection and cannot safely go back.</p> \n<p>Others have lived in Australia for years and have built families and lives and communities here, there is no other \u201chome\u201d to go back to.</p> \n<p>Australians too, are stranded overseas.

  "<h2>Stephen Colbert</h2> <p>On Tuesday\u2019s at-home Late Show, Stephen Colbert reacted to the previous night\u2019s late news: at 10pm on Monday, Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/apr/21/trump-us-immigration-ban-pause-green-cards\">announced via tweet an executive order</a> to temporarily suspend all immigration into the United States. \u201cWhile I don\u2019t necessarily agree with it,\u201d said Colbert, \u201cit\u2019s probably the safest thing \u2013 for the immigrants. Because right now America is basically a Petri dish on the floor of a bus station men\u2019s room.\u201d</p> <p>The president later claimed the 60-day ban on green cards was meant to protect American workers, \u201cbut this ban is not going to do anything to stop the spread of the virus or put Americans back to work\u201d, Colbert explained. \u201cIt\u2019s just Trump using the virus as an excuse to do what he\u2019s always wanted to do anyway. It\u2019s like if your house catches fire and you say, \u2018Honey, it\u2019s not safe in there \u2013 I\u2019m going to go buy a set of golf clubs.\u2019\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxDK95Q5qN0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PxDK95Q5qN0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>It\u2019s worth asking, Colbert continued, \u201cexactly how xenophobic is he being here?\u201d He cited the 1918 flu pandemic, during which the United States allowed more than 110,000 immigrants to enter the country. \u201cSo, Donald Trump is more xenophobic than Woodrow Wilson.\u201d</p> <p>At this point, we\u2019re all used to the president\u2019s reliance on Twitter for what should be coordinated executive branch announcements. Still, \u201cthis shouldn\u2019t shock me, but the United States of America has a president who just ordered a sweeping change in our national immigration policy via tweet\u201d, said Colbert. \u201cThat would be like Obama announcing the death of Bin Laden on TikTok.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/21/jimmy-kimmel-donald-trump-trevor-noah-stephen-colbert\">Jimmy Kimmel on Trump's protest praise: 'Irresponsible to the most unbelievable degree'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The tweet, Colbert noted, had absolutely no detail on how this ban would work, which reportedly caught some homeland security officials off-guard \u2013 and \u201cyou don\u2019t ever want to catch homeland security off-guard\u201d, he added. \u201cThat\u2019s like your doctor holding up your chest X-ray and going, \u2018Oh, I did not see that coming.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s really only one logic that explains this late-night policy drop: \u201cTrump\u2019s tweet is less about information and more about promoting today\u2019s press briefing, reality show-style,\u201d Colbert concluded, then imitated the president: \u201cHere\u2019s a teaser of my new executive order \u2013 am I really going to ban all immigrants? Will I throw wine in Steve Mnuchin\u2019s face and call him a bitch? Gotta tune in to find out.\u201d</p> <h2>Trevor Noah</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1252786538095788032\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">While you&#39;re watching &quot;Ozark&quot; and baking bread, Trump is using coronavirus to push through his most draconian policies. <a href=\"https://t.co/FZAQaqvv8X\">pic.twitter.com/FZAQaqvv8X</a></p>&mdash; The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1252786538095788032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 22, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>On the Daily Social Distancing Show, Trevor Noah called Trump\u2019s immigration ban via tweet \u201ca big step for Trump, because remember, two-thirds of his wives have been immigrants \u2013 closing the immigration system is Trump\u2019s version of deleting Tinder\u201d.</p> <p>The ban \u201cobviously has some people alarmed, because he is the president\u201d, said Noah. And if Trump does use the virus as an excuse to freeze immigration, \u201cit will be yet another policy he\u2019s pushing through during the coronavirus pandemic\u201d, Noah continued. \u201cIn fact, his administration has already shut down visa applications, they\u2019ve paused the refugee program, they\u2019ve blocked migrants from seeking asylum, and during corona, Trump\u2019s EPA even decided to drastically cut enforcement of environmental regulations.\u201d</p> <p>Noah concluded by reminding those watching at home: \u201cWhile you\u2019re finally getting around to watching Ozark and trying to bake bread for the first time, Donald Trump is also using coronavirus as an opportunity to do all the things he always wanted to do. The only difference is: when quarantine is over, and you throw away your bowl of yeast, Trump\u2019s hobbies are going to keep going for a very long time.\u201d</p> <h2>Jimmy Kimmel</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXbAVEYI0bs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MXbAVEYI0bs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel recapped a series of lies told by the president at his press conference on Monday, such as his claim that he knew coronavirus was bad months ago and didn\u2019t hold any rallies in February and March (he held several). Trump essentially said, according to Kimmel: \u201cDid I hold a rally in an enclosed space even though I now claim to have known it was dangerous at the time? Yes! Do I have an advent calendar, counting down the days until I can hold my next one. You bet your dirty mask I do!\u201d</p> <p>Trump also claimed to be holed up in the White House for months, but he actually made four trips in March, including to his resort in Florida, Mar-a-Lago \u2013 which incidentally laid off 153 people on Tuesday, in addition to the 560 laid off at Trump\u2019s resort in Miami. \u201cMaybe this is why he\u2019s so anxious to open for business again: <em>he\u2019s </em>getting hurt,\u201d Kimmel surmised.</p> <p>\u201cThis gives you a sense of how things are going at the White House: the president\u2019s own coronavirus taskforce \u2013 members of his own team \u2013 are reportedly actively ignoring him now,\u201d Kimmel continued. \u201cThey say the vice-poodle, Mike Pence, won\u2019t even sniff his butt.\u201d It doesn\u2019t make any sense, Kimmel joked: \u201cWhy would they ignore a president who has so many great ideas? Remember when he wanted to nuke the hurricane? You probably think I\u2019m joking, but go ahead and Google that.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The spectacular eruptions of the K\u012blauea volcano in Hawaii in 2018 were triggered by extreme rainfall in the preceding months, research suggests.</p> <p>Scientists say the finding raises the possibility that climate breakdown, which is causing more extreme weather, could lead to an increase in eruptions around the world.</p> <p>The 2018 K\u012blauea eruptions were one of the most extraordinary sequences in at least 200 years, according to the scientists, with rifts opening, summit explosions and collapses, and a magnitude 6.9 earthquake. But the trigger was not known.</p> <p>However, several months of unusually high rainfall preceded the eruption, with one 24-hour period setting a record for the entire US. This flood of water would have percolated down into fissures and pores in the rocks of the volcano, as far as 1.8 miles (2.9km) below the surface.</p> <p>The scientists calculated this pushed up the pore pressure inside the rocks to the highest level in almost 50 years, weakening them and allowing magma to push up from below.</p> <p>The scientists also looked at eruptions of K\u012blauea since 1790 and found that these historical events were twice as likely to happen in the rainy season. Such a link has long been thought possible \u2013 JD Dana, one of the first geologists to visit Hawaii in the late 1800s, <a href=\"https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/1993/0445/pdf/of1993-0445.pdf\">suggested the idea</a>.</p> <p>They also ruled out magma pressure from below triggering the eruption, because the surface had barely deformed, and the gravitational pull of the sun and moon, which can trigger eruptions.</p> <p>\u201cAll the circumstantial evidence points in the same direction,\u201d said Jamie Farquharson, at the University of Miami, whose <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2172-5\">research is published in the journal Nature</a>. Rain has been linked to shallow eruptions in the past, such as at Mount St Helens in 1980, but this is the first time an impact at depth has been found.</p> <p>\u201cCritically, as our climate continues to change, the occurrence of prolonged periods of extreme rainfall is predicted to increase in many parts of the world, increasing the potential for rainfall-triggered volcanic phenomena,\u201d said Farquharson, adding that research on the phenomenon was needed on other volcanoes. <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/volcano-eruption-climate-change-mountain-landslide-glacier-global-warming-a8299821.html\">Other scientists</a> have warned that the melting of ice on volcanic peaks may also cause eruptions.</p> <p>Farquharson said rainfall could now be an additional factor taken into account when assessing the risk of a volcano erupting.</p> <p>Michael Manga, at the University of California, Berkeley, who was not part of the study, said: \u201cVolcanoes are part of a dynamic Earth system. Volcanic eruptions influence all surface environments, including climate and weather. Changes in those surface environments, such as heavy rainfall, might also influence eruptions. We are only just beginning to understand these interactions.\u201d</p>",

But both defected from the regime, and they seemed to have thought that would protect them from their past. </p> <p>On Thursday Raslan and Gharib will appear at a regional court in the south-western German town of Koblenz, the first trial for war crimes relating to state torture in Syria since the start of the conflict nine years ago.</p> <p>Raslan, 57, is charged with crimes against humanity, rape, aggravated sexual assault and 58 murders at Branch 251, an intelligence unit with its own prison in Damascus, where he allegedly oversaw the torture of at least 4,000 people as a commanding officer between 29 April 2011 and 7 September 2012.</p> <p>The indictment lists prisoners being hung from their wrists, electrocuted, beaten until unconscious and subjected to a method called <em>dulab, </em>or wheel, where victims were forced into a vehicle tyre and then hoisted up and beaten.</p> <p>Eyad al-Gharib, 42, a more lowly official allegedly tasked with rounding up protesters, is accused of assistance to torture and murder in 30 counts.</p> <p>Six Syrians who were tortured at Branch 251 have been given the right to appear at the court as co-plaintiffs, though travel restrictions introduced since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in Europe mean only three are expected to be present when the trial begins.</p> <p>The Koblenz trial taking place because in 2002 Germany enacted the legal principle of universal jurisdiction for crimes against humanity, allowing the prosecution of serious crimes in its courts even if they happened elsewhere.</p> <p>A special war crimes unit at Germany\u2019s federal criminal police was set up in 2003, initially investigating suspected genocides in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Yugoslav wars.</p> <p>As thousands of Syrian refugees applied for asylum in Germany between 2015 and 2017, the unit received more than 2,800 tipoffs about crimes allegedly committed under the regime of Bashar al-Assad.</p> <p>In the case of Raslan and Gharib, the initial tipoffs came at least partially from the men themselves. It appears that, when interviewed by German officials, they made little attempt to hide their part in the violent suppression of political dissent. </p> <p>Raslan is understood to have deserted from the regime in 2012, after forces loyal to Assad carried out a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/01/houla-massacre-reconstructing-25-may\">massacre in his home town</a>. He sought asylum in Germany in 2014.</p> <p>Living at a refugee shelter in Marienfelde, Berlin, Raslan did not change his name, and he was eventually recognised by other Syrians, including opposition supporters and a prominent human rights lawyer.</p> <p>Raslan appeared to have no fear of German authorities. According to reports in German newspapers, independently confirmed by the Guardian, Raslan entered a Berlin police station in February 2015 to request protection from Syrian and Russian intelligence operatives he believed had followed him to a recent doctor\u2019s appointment.</p> <p>\u201cHe appeared to think there was nothing to it,\u201d Christian Ritscher, an investigator for the German public prosecutor general in Karlsruhe, told the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung.</p> <p>Raslan, who was probably already on the radar of the German war crimes investigators when he sought official protection, was arrested in February 2019.</p> <p>Gharib too gave German investigators more information than they had expected. When interviewed for his asylum application in Germany in the summer of 2018, he freely said that in Damascus he had helped round up protesters and people taking pictures of the protests on their phones, who were transported to Branch 251.</p> <p>He claimed to have deserted in January 2012 because he had been asked to kill civilians, and because three of his colleagues had died in skirmishes near Damascus.</p> <p>His knowledge of the secret police\u2019s procedures led to him being taken in for further questioning, initially as a witness. But he was reclassified as a suspect after revealing extremely detailed knowledge of torture methods, including the use of kettles to burn victim\u2019s backs and the breaking of detainees\u2019 legs with iron bars to stop them taking part in future demonstrations.</p> <p>A legal complaint about the interview procedure led to Gharib briefly being released, but this was rejected by the federal high court last June. The fact he did not try to flee from German authorities in the meantime is likely to count in his favour at trial.</p> <p>Whether Raslan and Gharib will plead guilty or not guilty is unclear. The pair are being represented by separate defence lawyers, who have both declined to comment on their strategy. </p> <p>In the courtroom, the two Syrians\u2019 role in the regime\u2019s torture apparatus will be weighed against their decisions to defect. If it comes to sentencing, \u201cthe court will also have to take into account what these men did after taking part in human rights abuses\u201d, said Patrick Kroker, a Berlin-based criminal lawyer working with some of the co-plaintiffs in the case.</p> <p>The hope among the Syrian diaspora is that the trial, which could last two to three years, will not just test the guilt of two individuals but also lay bare the workings of a violent system that suppressed and murdered thousands of civilians. </p>",
  "<p>America\u2019s addiction to mass incarceration could almost double its number of deaths from coronavirus, with jails acting as incubators of the disease and spreading a further 100,000 fatalities across the US.</p> <p>The startling warning comes from groundbreaking modeling by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and academic researchers, released on Wednesday.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/covidinjails\">The analysis</a> found that unless instant action is taken to reduce jail populations, a terrible price will be paid. Jails, which house men and women not yet convicted, will act as mass vectors of the contagion.</p> <p>As many as 99,000 more people could die in the US as a result of the virus being contracted behind jail walls, the study predicts. Of those, 23,000 are projected to succumb behind bars and 76,000 in surrounding communities as a result of inmates spreading the virus upon release.</p> <p>The projection would almost double last month\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/donald-trump-coronavirus-briefing-painful-us-deaths\">White House</a> modeling of Covid-19\u2019s grim legacy in terms of lives lost.</p> <p>\u201cWhen it comes to Covid-19 deaths, mass incarceration is our achilles heel,\u201d said Udi Ofer, director of the ACLU\u2019s justice division.</p> <p>The US is truly exceptional among countries grappling with the coronavirus in that no other nation incarcerates people on such a scale, which in turn has critical implications for the threat posed by such an outbreak. The US accounts for 4% of the world\u2019s population, but 21% of its incarcerated population.</p> <p>The ACLU modeling, developed with epidemiologists from Washington state and the Universities of Tennessee and Pennsylvania, focuses on the 740,000 people held in US jails. Conditions inside such institutions are often even worse than in the notorious prison system and amount to a Covid-19 perfect storm.</p> <p>Jails are so overcrowded there is virtually no possibility to place inmates 6ft apart, and sanitation is often rudimentary.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/17/covid-19-prison-new-york-rikers-island\">I'm in prison in New York. Many are sick with Covid-19 \u2013\u00a0and I fear for our safety | James Johnson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe two things the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] recommends for Americans to fight the virus \u2013 social distancing and personal hygiene \u2013 are both impossible in jails,\u201d Ofer said.</p> <p>There is huge churn in jail populations. On average inmates spend 25 days inside and many just a day or two, creating a revolving door between institutions and surrounding communities which the virus can exploit.</p> <p>Add to that churn the bald fact that there are almost 11m admissions into US jails each year \u2013 one every three seconds \u2013 and the potential for jails to act as vectors of disease is evident.</p> <p>Inmates, who come burdened with a relatively high incidence of underlying health conditions such as diabetes and asthma, are vulnerable to contracting the virus while incarcerated and can quickly carry it back to their communities.</p> <p>The ACLU study is understood to be the first to attempt to measure the potential harm inflicted by mass incarceration in terms of Covid-19. Its calculations are based on a detailed study of one typical jail, in Allegheny county, Pennsylvania, which was used to conduct tailored modeling of individual jurisdictions across 1,242 counties that account for about 90% of the US population.</p> <p>The projection that mass incarceration could cause an extra 99,000 deaths is almost certainly an undercount, as the researchers did not take into account either prisons or immigration detention centers. Those institutions have a more sedentary population but are still highly vulnerable to contagion.</p> <p>Just how easily coronavirus can spread behind bars is illustrated in Ohio, where more than <a href=\"https://www.dispatch.com/news/20200419/coronavirus-in-ohio-more-than-1800-inmates-at-marion-correctional-test-positive\">1,800 prisoners</a> at the Marion correctional institution have tested positive \u2013 73% of the total prison number. Across the state as a whole, one in five confirmed Covid-19 cases are among incarcerated inmates.</p> <p>In Cook county jail in Chicago, almost 400 inmates have tested positive and six have died. About 225 staff have also tested positive and <a href=\"https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/cook-county-jail-guard-dies-of-coronavirus/2259091/\">one correctional officer</a> has died.</p> <p>The ACLU argues that the lesson of its research is that mass incarceration has become a major health threat to all Americans, not just those locked up. The solution, the advocacy group contends, is to reduce the jail population as quickly as possible.</p> <p>Only 5% of more than 10m arrests in the US each year are for violent offences. Most people ending up in jail are there for low-level infractions, including failure to meet bail terms.</p> <p>Some states and jails have made inroads in tackling the crisis. Colorado has reduced its jail population by 31% since the pandemic began, Los Angeles county by 25% and even Republican-leaning Kentucky by 28%.</p>",
  "<p>The amount of money migrant workers send back to their home countries is expected to decrease by almost $110bn this year as the Covid 19 pandemic increases unemployment across the world.</p> <p>Remittances to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are projected to fall by nearly 20% to $445bn (\u00a3360bn), \u201crepresenting the loss of a crucial financial lifeline for many vulnerable households\u201d, the World Bank said.</p> <p>Describing the decrease as the worst in recent history, including the 2008 financial crisis, the Washington-based development bank said migrant workers were especially vulnerable to losing their jobs during coronavirus lockdowns which are still largely in place across the developed world.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/may/11/remittances-three-times-greater-aid-sdgs\">Remittances total a</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/may/11/remittances-three-times-greater-aid-sdgs\">about three times the amount of aid</a> received by low-income countries and have become a cornerstone of living standards across the developing world.</p> <p>Migrants typically send money to their families to boost living standards in some of the poorest parts of the world, including south Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and South America. Eastern Europe is expected to be one of the worst-hit regions as migrant workers in western Europe and Russia are forced to cut back the amounts they send back to families in Romania, Bulgaria, Ukraine and other former Soviet bloc countries.</p> <p>The World Bank said studies showed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/jun/15/remittances-help-migrants-families-and-the-uk\">remittances alleviated poverty in lower- and middle-income countries</a>, improved nutrition, were linked to higher spending on education, and reduced child labour in disadvantaged households.</p> <p>\u201cA fall in remittances affect families\u2019 ability to spend on these areas as more of their finances will be directed to solve food shortages and immediate livelihoods needs,\u201d it said.</p> <p>Countries that are large recipients of remittances, such as India, have also imposed lockdowns, causing widespread unemployment and hardship, often making the situation even worse for families that suffer a decline in money being sent home.</p> <p>Oil-dependent countries, which have seen crude prices tumble from more than $60 a barrel in January to less than $20 a barrel this week, have also been hit by the economic impact of the pandemic, limiting the amount of help they can offer poor families.</p> <p>Dilip Ratha, chief economist for migration and remittances at the World Bank, said migrants often worked in insecure jobs and were among the first to be let go in a crisis.</p> <p>\u201cBut it is not just that they lose their jobs, the stores they use to send cash home have also shut down,\u201d he said. \u201cMigrants typically send small amounts of cash via stores and these have closed.\u201d</p> <p>Ratha said the developed world has come to depend on migrant workers for cheap and skilled labour, and should do more to alleviate their situation. They need access to healthcare for themselves and their families and cut-price banking facilities, which would allow them to send money home without paying high fees and commissions.</p> <p>Last year, remittances reached an all-time high of $554bn. Next year, the World Bank expects a 5.6% recovery from the $445bn predicted this year to $470bn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>It said: \u201cThe outlook for remittance remains as uncertain as the impact of Covid-19 on the outlook for global growth and on the measures to restrain the spread of the disease.</p> <p>\u201cIn the past, remittances have been countercyclical, where workers send more money home in times of crisis and hardship back home.

The league says teams will start training from 4 May. But there are lots of unanswered questions over the announcement.</p> \n  <p>In a press conference, <strong>Wayne Pearce</strong>, the Balmain legend tasked with heading up the league\u2019s grandly titled \u201cProject Apollo\u201d to get the season running again, said the NRL had achieved \u201ca lot more clarity around the medical process and what those protocols are\u201d and that \u201cgovernment authorities\u201d were \u201cvery supportive\u201d of their plans.</p> \n  <p>What he didn\u2019t say was what those protocols were, and which government authorities the league has been talking to. Basically, who in the government has given the league sign-off to begin playing again?</p> \n  <p>I\u2019ve been trying to find out this afternoon, with little joy.</p> \n  <p>We know that the NSW police commissioner, <strong>Mick Fuller</strong>, who is in charge of the state\u2019s response to Covid-19, previously wrote to the NRL chairman Peter V\u2019landys saying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/17/nrl-forge-ahead-with-resumption-plan-despite-no-approval-from-nsw-government\">there was no legal obstacle for the NRL\u2019s plans to resume playing despite strict public health orders</a>. </p> \n  <p>That\u2019s because the league was given an exemption under the original PHOs issued last month, and stopped playing matches voluntarily. </p> \n  <p>However in the letter Fuller also said the league would have to develop protocols to demonstrate it could resume safely. The premier, <strong>Gladys Berejiklian</strong>, said something similar when she was asked about it last week. </p> \n  <p>So who has signed off on the protocols? NSW Health still hasn\u2019t responded to my queries, and the NSW police seems to think there\u2019s nothing to be signed off on. </p> \n  <p>Here\u2019s what a spokeswoman told me:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>As far as we are aware, there is nothing to be \u2018signed-off\u2019. The commissioner has stated previously that the letter was advice in response to their inquiry. I don\u2019t have anything further to provide you.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Perhaps we\u2019ll hear more from the NSW government later tonight or tomorrow, but it seems odd that neither the NRL nor the state government has explained who is in charge of making this decision.</p> \n  <p>The NRL is also still awaiting clearance from the federal and New Zealand governments for the New Zealand Warriors to arrive in Australia on May 3, a day before the rest of the competition resumes training. </p> \n  <p>The Queensland premier, <strong>Annastacia Palaszczuk</strong>, has also previously said she would not look kindly on the three teams from her state travelling back and forth to NSW for matches.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T09:25:50.482Z\">at 10.25am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea005078f085a072d3bced8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T09:06:05.348Z\">10.06am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Need a distraction from Covid-19?

It\u2019s business investment that drives productivity which drives higher wages. So that\u2019s the problem, let\u2019s frame that up first. Look I think it is important for us to put it back on the table but along with other tax reform. It\u2019s not the only thing that needs to be done. It\u2019s important that we look at the state taxes, the productivity sapping stamp duty taxes, payroll tax. It is interesting how much payroll tax has been deferred. <br></p> \n   <p>The whole question of the right configuration of the state taxes. Whether or not we bring forward those other income tax cuts. So it\u2019s not just company taxes but it is important we have a competitive company tax rate. To the treasurer\u2019s point, we\u2019re not asking, in the Business Council, for us to have the lowest rate, we\u2019re simply asking for a competitive rate, so that we can be a magnet for investment in this country. <br></p> \n   <p>Because we already have so many advantages, but we have one disadvantage which is a tax rate that is so much higher than everywhere else in the world. As you and I have talked about many times, at the height of this debate, 63% of Australians supported lowering the corporate tax rate.

And who knows, there could be foreign crews flying over Australian air and sky, with foreign pay and conditions. <br></p> \n   <p>So at the end of the day, this is about keeping skilled jobs, this is about making investments where perhaps the taxpayer doesn\u2019t ultimately foot the entire bill. <br></p> \n   <p>So I think there\u2019s a deal to be done in voluntary administration, but I tell you what, for the regions, for our tourism, for low fares, and for the taxpayer not having to pay the massive costs if tens of thousands of people just lose their jobs, I think a deal should be done.

So there are exceptional circumstances where further restrictions might be placed on people living in residential aged care facilities in terms of access to visitors. <br></p> \n   <p>But those additional restrictions are the exception, they are not the rule, and we think it is a good thing for people to have those visits in accordance with those screening procedures and other things that are necessary to protect elderly residents in those situations. <br></p> \n   <p>It shouldn\u2019t be done out of the convenience of isolation in terms of how these facilities are run, it should always be done always only in the interests of the care of those who are living in those facilities. <br></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T23:50:18.282Z\">at 12.50am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9f799b8f08b5c61713e4ef\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T22:54:59.712Z\">11.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Queensland reports no new infections</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Queensland has recorded no new cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours.</p> \n  <p>Great news.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T23:59:07.627Z\">at 12.59am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9f772f8f087a826b68ac18\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T22:47:56.213Z\">11.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Australia has undertaken the suppression method in response this pandemic.

That\u2019s an honest view. If, in the process of suppressing, we get to the point of eradication, then that would be a magnificent outcome. But we must continue to build capacity and we must continue to contain the virus, and remember that we\u2019re not immune from it.

  "<p>Short stories: how not to despair with the unjust way they are treated in the world of British letters? From their frequent definition in terms of what they are not \u2013 <em>a novel \u2013</em> to the reluctance of risk-averse publishers when it comes to releasing one of these not-novels into the world. The latter tendency is falling out of fashion, thank God (thanks in large part to indie presses). But the hapless short-story book is still generally referred to as a \u201ccollection\u201d in English. Call me picky, but this has always been a problematic word for me, because it masks the fact that this kind of book \u2013 if any good \u2013 is still a coherent conceptual unit: stories don\u2019t grow spontaneously, like weed, so that writers can simply <em>collect</em> them. What\u2019s wrong with calling a book of short stories \u201ca book of short stories\u201d? </p> <p>Coming both literally and literarily from Latin America, these idiosyncrasies have always puzzled me. It is in the short story that our authors excel, and this is a hill I am willing to die on. The form is valued by readers, publishers and critics alike, cherished for its close connection to storytelling as oral tradition, and second to none in the region\u2019s canon. And if I had to choose which books to preserve on a bookshelf of posterity I would salvage this unassuming genre and toss many an oversize novel, especially those written by otherwise excellent short-story writers.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.influxpress.com/jolts\">JOLTS</a>, my latest book of short stories, is styled in the Latin American tradition but written in English, a borrowed language \u2013 in this way I have managed to straddle both and neither worlds. This is a discomfort I cherish. This feeling of sitting somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic, trying to force a dialogue between two totally different canons, and two different parts of myself, has been a constant source of inspiration. But there is always fear about what might get lost in translation. Although I have included many nods to my masters in the book, I suspect some of these could be hard to pin down for a British reader. So this is an attempt to pay explicit homage to some of the Latin American short story writers that influenced my own practice, together with others that have caught my attention in recent years. Hopefully this \u2013 incomplete \u2013 list might be a first step for any curious lover of short fiction.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8dfb8354145cbd8f85889ec060db40c8b87b8ad0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8dfb8354145cbd8f85889ec060db40c8b87b8ad0/0_272_3438_4928/698.jpg\" alt=\"Jorge Luis Borges\" width=\"698\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jorge Luis Borges at home in Buenos Aires.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Pillitz/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>1. <a href=\"http://www.digiovanni.co.uk/borges/the-garden-of-branching-paths/tlon-uqbar-orbis-tertius.htm\">Tl\u00f6n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius</a> by Jorge Luis Borges<br></strong>Few stories better capture the power of writing than this one by Argentina\u2019s most famous literary export. Imaginary lands and imaginary planets, forged volumes of the British Encyclopaedia and forged quotes \u2013 a Borgesian favourite \u2013 come together in this tale where fiction writes itself into reality; in which one can\u2019t be told from the other.</p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=113832491&amp;t=1587484537746\">The Llano in Flames</a> by Juan Rulfo<br></strong>Rulfo achieved world fame with his novel <a href=\"https://serpentstail.com/pedro-paramo-pb.html\">Pedro P\u00e1ramo</a><em> </em>but his short stories are equally worthy of attention. The Llano in Flames, from <a href=\"https://structomagazine.co.uk/structo-press/\">the homonymous book</a> perfectly embodies his style: economy of prose, sensorial images that in their attention to nature greatly capture the essence of rural Mexico, characters who seem to exist beyond life and death. Rulfo only published two books in his lifetime but his influence can still be felt.</p> <p><strong>3. <a href=\"http://necessaryfiction.com/stories/AngelicaGorodischerAbsit\">Absit</a> by Ang\u00e9lica </strong><strong>Gorodischer <br></strong>A disturbing tale of perversion and revenge in which a child narrowly escapes abuse by pushing her attacker into a construction site hole. It might sound like a spoiler but this act of karmic justice is just the beginning. That this story explores adults\u2019 capacity for wrong is clear from its opening paragraph. But are children also capable of evil? A dark but satisfying read by an Argentinian short story talent which deserves to be read more widely.</p> <p><strong>4. <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17208637-the-trail-of-your-blood-in-the-snow?rating=2\">The Trail of Your Blood in the Snow</a> by Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez<br></strong>Better known for his immortal novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/may/16/one-hundred-years-of-solitude-gabriel-garcia-marquez-magical-realism-fantasy\">One Hundred Years of Solitude</a>, the Colombian Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez was also the author of outstanding short stories. In this one, a wealthy couple on their honeymoon in Europe go through a dramatic, Kafkaesque ordeal, taking the reader on a suffocating journey. Legend has it Borges said that 50 years would have sufficed for One Hundred Years of Solitude, but not one word is a word too many in this magnificent story.</p> <p><strong>5. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpMcDzH9uk\">Perfumada Noche</a> (Scented Night) by Haroldo Conti<br></strong>A beautiful ode to life, love, and death in a small town in the Province of Buenos Aires. Unlike his novel <a href=\"https://www.andotherstories.org/southeaster/\">Southeaster</a> but along with much of his work, this story remains untranslated into English. Conti was disappeared by the Argentinian military junta in 1976. Before this tragic end he gifted us in Perfumada Noche one of the most evocative opening sentences ever written: \u201cThe life of a man is a miserable draft, a handful of sorrows that fit in just a few lines.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bb0c887ed9ad5853053f134fea7ee35ecf8b9575\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb0c887ed9ad5853053f134fea7ee35ecf8b9575/0_158_2796_4079/685.jpg\" alt=\"Clarice Lispector in Rio de Janeiro, circa 1964.\" width=\"685\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Miraculous \u2026 Clarice Lispector in Rio de Janeiro, circa 1964.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paulo Gurgel Valente</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>6. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/mar/05/clarice-lispector-short-story-survey\">The Fifth Story</a> by Clarice Lispector<br></strong>It is nothing short of miraculous that <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23365262-the-complete-stories\">all of </a><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23365262-the-complete-stories\">Lispector\u2019s short fiction</a> is available in English. Choosing a single story by one of Latin America\u2019s finest writers is a cruel exercise but a great entry point to her work is The Fifth Story, from her book The Foreign Legion. All her most interesting traits are there: a certain linguistic strangeness, the subversion of domestic space, the sadistic brutality of everyday life, and the metafictional bent that would explode in her later works.</p> <p><strong>7. <a href=\"https://www.redalyc.org/pdf/2550/255020424003.pdf\">Letter to a Young Lady in Paris by Julio Cort\u00e1zar</a><br></strong>Reading Cort\u00e1zar\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/107/1075048/bestiary/9781846559242.html\">Bestiario</a> as a teenager was my literary \u201clistening to the Sex Pistols\u201d moment. I devoured the book from cover to cover and ran to my mother\u2019s Olivetti to start churning out my own short stories. Some of these early attempts still exist in my box of memories but needless to say none of them is as good as Letter to a Young Lady in Paris, from this extraordinary book. A flat swap starts to go wrong when our hero, who writes the missive of the title, starts vomiting bunnies that proceed to destroy the flat. Sounds strange? Welcome to Cort\u00e1zar\u2019s world.</p> <p><strong>8. Las amapolas tambi\u00e9n tienen espinas (Poppies Also Have Thorns) by Pedro Lemebel<br></strong>Criminally underpublished in English, <a href=\"https://minorliteratures.com/2015/02/09/pedro-lemebel-farewell-to-a-queer-icon/\">Lemebel</a>, is one of Chile\u2019s most singular voices. Gay, mestizo, working class and communist, it would be hard to find a more unlikely survivor of the Pinochet years. His <em>cr\u00f3nicas</em> of the Santiago of the 70s, 80s, and 90s, are brutal yet endearing documents of lives lived in the margins. In this story from his <em>La esquina es mi coraz\u00f3n</em> (The Corner is My Heart) Lemebel tells a tale of desire, class and violent homophobia. And he does so endearingly, honestly, and with characteristic dark humour. Lemebel as a transvestite<em> fl\u00e2neur</em> is an exceptional guide to the Latin American city.</p> <p><strong>9. Sky and Poplars by Margarita Garc\u00eda Robayo<br></strong><a href=\"https://charcopress.com/bookstore/fish-soup\">Fish Soup</a> by the Colombian Garc\u00eda Robayo is a remarkable recent genre-bending effort, that brings together short stories and two novellas. A deadpan beat runs through the whole book \u2013 at times you find yourself giggling at things, only to question yourself a second later whether you should really be laughing about that. Sky and Poplars is in my opinion where she best displays her craft. In it, romantic and familial unspoken tragedies meet gentrification, to portray a suffocating world of angst and alienation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/11/tessa-hadley-top-10-short-stories\">Tessa Hadley's top 10 short stories</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>10.

  "<p>One wintry evening in Paris in 1965, a young woman flew in from Bulgaria to find that the friend of a friend supposed to meet her had forgotten to turn up. She was 24, with \u201cprominent cheekbones\u201d and \u201calmond-shaped eyes\u201d, and she had only $5 plus a couple of volumes of Hegel and a toothbrush. A woman from the plane took her to the Bulgarian embassy; through other contacts, she quickly got to know <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/jan/13/death-of-the-author\">Roland Barthes</a>, the poet Louis Aragon and the philsopher Lucien Goldmann. There are, Alice Jardine writes in this biography of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2006/mar/14/highereducation.research1\">Julia Kristeva</a>, \u201ca handful of personal stories\u201d that the theorist \u201chas told many times in interviews, films, essays and fiction\u201d, and of those, this one is a favourite. The cheekbones and the eyes come from Kristeva\u2019s highly autobiographical first novel, <em>The Samurai </em>(1990), which also has lots of sex in it and many mentions of the author\u2019s own self-characterised \u201csquirrel-coloured\u201d hair.<br><br>Kristeva was born in Sliven, Bulgaria in 1941, the elder daughter of a scientifically trained mother and a father who worked for the orthodox church. They moved into Sofia in 1945, and Julia was put into a French nursery and later did extra French at the Alliance Fran\u00e7aise after school. When De Gaulle offered scholarships to French-speaking east Europeans, she was a shoo-in. She had only $5 when she arrived in Paris because that was all the western currency she could get her hands on. The friend of the friend was supposed to have brought along more.<br><br>There is no doubt, as Jardine writes, that Kristeva is one of the major European writers of our time. Philosophy, psychoanalysis, anthropology, linguistics \u2013 she has left her mark on all of them, and if you try imagining an ideal type of the glamorous French feminist intellectual, it\u2019s probably Kristeva that you see. But she is also, Jardine acknowledges, much ridiculed, and the rumours that surfaced a couple of years ago about her spying for the Bulgarian secret service started in France in the mid-1960s, almost the moment her plane touched ground. (Actually, the \u201cSabina files\u201d, as the Bulgarian records of Kristeva\u2019s spying career are known, largely relate to how often Kristeva\u2019s letters home to her parents were opened and read without permission. \u201cAggravated surveillance\u201d, Kristeva has called this, and people who know much more about spying than I do, such as Neal Ascherson and Maria Dimitrova, agree.)<br><br>But the really great thing about being a Bulgarian in Paris in the 60s was that your Eastern-bloc education gave you access to ideas that the Parisians really wanted to know about: Prague School linguistics, especially the work of Roman Jakobson; Russian formalism and post-formalism. Kristeva knew all about all of it, and sometimes knew the theorists personally: no wonder the French surrealo-structuralists took her to their hearts so quickly. And for the novelist Philippe Sollers, also the editor of the avant-gardist journal Tel Quel, the attraction was also physical, a \u201ccoup de foudre\u201d. Kristeva married him in 1967, at least partly for visa reasons \u2013 Sollers was already involved with a much older Belgian writer, Dominique Rolin, and would remain so until Rolin\u2019s death \u2013 but the couple appear to have kept up a close and affectionate open relationship ever since.<br><br>Kristeva\u2019s early work culminated in the massive <em>Revolution in Poetic Language </em>(1974). She agreed with the structuralists that language, myth and ritual can all be studied systematically, as signs; except that such systems are never static. Language is spoken, by particular subjects at particular moments in time, and such \u201cspeaking subjects\u201d are themselves subject to a language and history in constant flux. The early Kristeva was known in particular for her interest in what she called \u201cthe semiotic\u201d, the pre-linguistic murmuration you can hear, when you listen for it, from infants, dreams, bodies, poetry, the avant garde.<br><br>She had barely heard of Freud before she arrived in Paris, but was much impressed by the \u201cchurch-like mood\u201d of Lacan\u2019s legendary seminars, and went into psychoanalysis herself in 1970. Such decisions were shaped, partly, by the attempts of the Tel Quel inner circle to respond to the political turmoil of France in the late 60s: the journal\u2019s line had already shifted from communism to Maoism, and Kristeva and Barthes, among others, visited China in 1974, to see \u201cthe Taoist anarchism\u201d \u2013 as Kristeva called it \u2013 for themselves. But her shift was also personal, to do with her sense of herself as a daughter, and with a longing she\u2019d started feeling to become a mother herself.<br><br>Kristeva\u2019s son, David Joyaux, was born in 1975 (Joyaux is Sollers\u2019s real surname: as well as being a Marxist avant-gardist, he\u2019s also the scion of a factory-owning family with an estate on the \u00cele de R\u00e9). David was tiny when he first became ill with \u201cneuromuscular problems \u2026 tremors \u2026 comas where the infant was literally balanced between life and death\u201d. Tests found nothing. \u201cThey called it \u2018an orphan disease\u2019 \u2013 and still do today.\u201d Now in his 40s, David is obviously much loved, and seems to enjoy life enormously. But he\u2019s often ill, and he needs support, according to Jardine, \u201c24/7\u201d. If you ever wondered why Kristeva publishes so much, and seems OK with all the silly personality-cultish media she attracts, this is probably a reason why.<br><br>It\u2019s also perhaps because of David\u2019s health that for Kristeva, it\u2019s impossible to think about maternity without thinking, too, about the awful fact of death: \u201cthe abject\u201d, she calls this \u201ctwisted braid of affects\u201d in her best-known book, <em>Powers of Horror </em>(1980). One form of this abjection is what Kristeva calls \u201cfood-loathing\u201d, which for her is exemplified by \u201cthat skin on the surface of milk \u2013 harmless, thin as a sheet of cigarette paper, pitiful as a nail-paring\u201d (interestingly, Jardine\u2019s book reports that Kristeva as a baby was not breastfed but given sheep\u2019s milk). But the big one is the repulsive, antisemitic disgust of the French novelist, C\u00e9line: she was on her analyst\u2019s couch, Kristeva remembers, talking about how much she hated him \u2013 \u201cNothing but massacres, horror, abjection!\u201d \u2013 when her analyst told her: \u201cThat\u2019s the word.\u201d<br><br>Jardine first met Kristeva in 1976, when she was 25, a graduate student in French at Columbia in New York. She was wearing a long, blue denim dress, Jardine remembers, and reading a book she held in her hand, with David on her right shoulder and a phone-receiver on her left. \u201cWhat is a coup de foudre that endures over time? I must ask myself this question \u2026\u201d Her book is \u201cnot a hagiography\u201d, she says, although it kind of is. The sources throughout are mostly from Kristeva, and whenever anybody says anything mean about our heroine \u2013 in <em>The 7th Function of Language</em>, Laurent Binet\u2019s \u201cferocious\u201d (ie, hilarious) comic <em>policier</em>, for example \u2013 Jardine takes Kristeva\u2019s part. \u201cKristeva herself has resisted the internet, only using email to communicate and even that as little as possible,\u201d Jardine writes. \u201c\u00c0 quoi bon lire en temps de tweets?\u201d I read the other day on the <a href=\"http://kristeva.fr/\">kristeva.fr</a> official website, to which I\u2019d been directed by Kristeva\u2019s official Twitter feed.<br><br>But it was thanks to Kristeva\u2019s Twitter that I found \u201cDisability Revisited\u201d, a lecture she delivered in English to the University of Oslo in 2018. In it, she explains how caring for her son has \u201ccommitted\u201d her to \u201ca gigantic task \u2026 neither more nor less than refounding humanism\u201d. To live and love in a relationship with disability in it is of course difficult, she says, but also \u201ca chance\u201d: a chance for both sides to reveal themselves to each other in their fullest singularities. It\u2019s not at all, as usually considered, a case of care-giver and care-object, but something far, far deeper and richer. \u201cHow does disability transform our idea of the human?\u201d she asks, going on to talk about mortality and vulnerability. \u201cEvery moment I measure the urgency and the utopia of this task.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>At the Risk of Thinking is published by Bloomsbury (RRP \u00a319.99).

  "<p>1970 was a simpler time. (February was a simpler time too, but for a moment let\u2019s think outside the pandemic bubble.)</p> <p>Simpler because our environmental troubles could be easily seen. The air above our cities was filthy, and the water in our lakes and streams was gross. There was nothing subtle about it. In New York City, the environmental lawyer Albert Butzel<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/28/nyregion/new-york-city-smog.html\"> described</a> a permanently yellow horizon: \u201cI not only saw the pollution, I wiped it off my windowsills.\u201d Or consider the testimony of a city medical examiner: \u201cThe person who spent his life in the Adirondacks has nice pink lungs.

And it worked. Worked politically because Congress quickly passed the <a href=\"https://archive.epa.gov/epa/aboutepa/epa-history-clean-air-act-1970.html\">Clean Air Act</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-clean-water-act\">Clean Water Act</a> and scientifically because those laws had the desired effect. In essence, they stuck enough filters on smokestacks, car exhausts and factory effluent pipes that, before long, the air and water were unmistakably cleaner. The nascent Environmental Protection Agency commissioned a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-us-cities-looked-like-before-epa-regulated-pollution-2019-8#barges-filled-with-new-yorks-waste-are-pulled-down-the-east-river-to-staten-island-landfill-in-the-1970s-new-york-produced-26000-tons-of-solid-waste-every-day-22\">series of photos</a> that showed just how filthy things were. Even for those of us who were alive then, it\u2019s hard to imagine that we tolerated this.</p> <p>But we should believe it, because now we face even greater challenges that we\u2019re doing next to nothing about. And one reason is you can\u2019t see them.</p> <p>The carbon dioxide molecule is invisible; at today\u2019s levels you can\u2019t see it or smell it, and it doesn\u2019t do anything to you. Carbon with one oxygen molecule? That\u2019s what kills you in a closed garage if you leave the car running. But two oxygen molecules? All that does is trap heat in the atmosphere. Melt ice caps. Raise seas. Change weather patterns. But slowly enough that most of the time, we don\u2019t quite see it.</p> <p>And it\u2019s a more complex moment for another reason. You can filter carbon monoxide easily. It\u2019s a trace gas, a tiny percentage of what comes from a power plant. But carbon dioxide is the exact opposite. It\u2019s most of what comes pouring out when you burn coal or gas or oil. There\u2019s no catalytic converter for CO<sub>2</sub>,<em><strong> </strong></em>which means you have to take down the fossil fuel industry.</p> <p>That in turn means you have to take on not just the oil companies but also the banks, asset managers and insurance companies that invest in them (and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-banks-energy-assets-exclusive/exclusive-us-banks-prepare-to-seize-energy-assets-as-shale-boom-goes-bust-idUSKCN21R3JI\">may even own them</a>, in the wake of the current economic crash). You have to take on, that is, the heart of global capital.</p> <p>And so we are. <a href=\"https://stopthemoneypipeline.com/\">Stop the Money Pipeline</a>, a coalition of environmental and climate justice groups running from the small and specialized to the Sierra Club and Greenpeace, formed last fall to try to tackle the biggest money on earth. Banks like Chase \u2013 the planet\u2019s largest by market capitalization \u2013 which has funneled a <a href=\"https://www.sierraclub.org/press-releases/2020/03/new-report-reveals-global-banks-funneled-27-trillion-fossil-fuels-paris\">quarter-trillion dollars</a> to the fossil fuel industry since the Paris agreement of 2015. Insurers like <a href=\"https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/environmental/liberty-mutual-facing-mounting-pressure-to-exit-fossil-fuels-219312.aspx\">Liberty Mutual</a>, still insuring tar sands projects even as pipeline builders endanger Native communities by trying to build the Keystone XL <a href=\"https://www.ecowatch.com/keystone-xl-pipeline-construction-2645607020.html?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1\">during a pandemic</a>.</p> <p>This campaign sounds quixotic, but it seemed to be getting traction until the coronavirus pandemic hit. In January, BlackRock <a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-ceo-letter\">announced</a> that it was going to put climate at the heart of its investment analyses. Liberty Mutual, under similar pressure from activists, began to <a href=\"https://www.ran.org/press-releases/liberty-mutual-adopts-coal-policy-in-response-to-public-pressure/\">edge away</a> from coal. And Chase \u2013 well, Earth Day would have seen activists engaging in civil disobedience in several thousand bank lobbies across America, sort of like the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3MKcYUUHxw\">protest in January</a> that helped launch the campaign (and sent me, among others, off in handcuffs). But we called that off; there\u2019s no way we were going to risk carrying the microbe into jails, where the people already locked inside have little chance of social distancing.</p> <p>Still, the pandemic may be causing as much trouble for the fossil fuel industry as our campaign hoped to. With the demand for oil cratering, it\u2019s clear that these companies have no future. The divestment campaign that, over a decade, has enlisted $14tn in endowments and portfolios in the climate fight has a new head of steam.</p> <p>Our job \u2013 a more complex one than faced our Earth Day predecessors 50 years ago \u2013 is to force the spring. We need to speed the transition to the solar panels and wind turbines that engineers have worked so mightily to improve and are now the cheapest way to generate power. The only thing standing in the way is the political power of the fossil fuel companies, on clear display as <a href=\"https://psmag.com/news/trump-seeks-to-speed-up-oil-and-gas-projects\">Donald Trump</a> does everything in his power to preserve their dominance. That\u2019s hard to overcome. Hard but simple. Just as in 1970, it demands unrelenting pressure from citizens. That pressure is coming. Indigenous nations, frontline communities, faith groups, climate scientists and savvy investors are joining together, and their voices are getting louder. Seven million of us were in the streets <a href=\"https://www.ecowatch.com/global-climate-strikes-week-2640790405.html?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1\">last September</a>. That\u2019s not 20 million, but it\u2019s on the way.</p> <p>We can\u2019t be on the streets right now. So we\u2019ll do what we can on the boulevards of the Internet. Join us for <a href=\"https://www.earthdaylive2020.org/\">Earth Day Live</a>, three days of digital activism beginning 22 April. We\u2019re in a race, and we\u2019re gaining fast.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Bill McKibben is an author and Schumann distinguished scholar in environmental studies at Middlebury College, Vermont.

That in effect is our work of art \u2013 a new view of the world.</p> <p>Eliasson admitted it was not an easy subject. \u201cThe wonderful idea of Earth Day allows one to take a step back, look at the planet from the outside and recognise that it is an object that is so hard and impossible to comprehend. It sort of escapes us.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a bit like the climate, it is so vast and abstract and full of numbers and crazy people \u2026 how on earth am I going to help? Or have an opinion on it?\u201d</p> <p>The work, titled Earth perspectives, is about encouraging people to reflect on the co-existence of multiple world views. The after-image is a kind of \u201cice breaker\u201d for bigger conversations, Eliasson said. There are many ways of thinking about it.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe it is not the planet which is in danger.

  "<h2>The album to start with</h2> <p><strong>Reign in Blood (1986)<br></strong>In 1986, thrash truly emerged from its classic, generally British, heavy metal influences, with the \u201cbig four\u201d \u2013 LA\u2019s Metallica, Megadeth, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/slayer\">Slayer</a> and NYC\u2019s Anthrax \u2013 all finding their sound. Metallica emphasised a paranoid grind, Anthrax a tongue-in-cheek, streetwise hardcore bounciness, and Megadeth a remnant of old-school, hard-rock boogie; Slayer, however, distilled and concentrated the essence of pure metal: the crystal meth to Iron Maiden and Judas Priest\u2019s medical Dexedrine. Every blastbeat and guitar widdle is faster, every scream higher, every grunt lower, every mood either assault or preparation for assault, and the subject matter is boiled down to Satan, slaughter and pain. All of metal\u2019s preposterous theatre and grandiosity is here, but at only 28 minutes from the first everyone-hitting-everything stab of Angel of Death to the final trickle of Raining Blood, it\u2019s perfectly nasty, brutish and short.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbyswHABG3Q\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cbyswHABG3Q?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Those two tracks are the classics that never left Slayer sets. Yes, Angel of Death is about Nazi surgeon Josef Mengele; no, Slayer are not Nazis, any more than they are Wahabbists for writing Jihad from the point of view of a 9/11 hijacker in 2006. In fact, their politics seem to lean to the oafish side of libertarianism. Like the rest of the album, Angel of Death is a schlock slasher movie, to the bone. Raining Blood, meanwhile, is utterly thrilling: even the squeamish or metal-averse can get caught up by the sharp-toothed earworm riffs. The twin-lead intro emerging from thunder and rain is probably the ultimate metal moment for main songwriters and guitarists, Kerry King and the late Jeff Hanemann.</p> <p>But there\u2019s not a weak link on the album. Necrophobic is under two minutes and rivals the UK grindcore acts emerging at the time for speed. Altar of Sacrifice is three minutes of perfect momentum, not a second to take a breath, just a constant rockfall of noise, perfectly controlled then grinding to a halt in the final seconds. It also features singer Tom Araya at his shoutiest, part of an undercurrent of hardcore and anarcho-crust-punk rage that always simmers beneath the metallic surfaces in Slayer. Epidemic is the closest to classic Brit metal, but it\u2019s done with such confidence that they\u2019re owning the sound rather than paying homage to Maiden. And on it goes. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/rick-rubin\">Rick Rubin</a>\u2019s production and the band\u2019s incredible ear for structure means that, aside from all the theatre, lyrical dumb-assery and athletic virtuosity, it can \u2013 even now \u2013 be appreciated on an immediate, unconscious level as a pure sonic rush.</p> <h2>The three to check out next</h2> <p><strong>Seasons in the Abyss (1990)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqnC54vbUbU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jqnC54vbUbU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Slayer were not the heaviest, the fastest nor the most revolting extreme metal band. They were quickly outflanked in the gruesomeness race by Death, Carcass and Cannibal Corpse, and in speed terms by Napalm Death, Electro Hippies and Extreme Noise Terror. But nobody else hit that sweet spot between metal histrionics and pure grunting bestial racket as precisely as Slayer. While they tried to diversify and even mellow on South of Heaven, Seasons in the Abyss is the sound of them realising that they\u2019re at their swaggering best going all-out. There is still some subdued grind here, but it\u2019s the proper rippers, such as War Ensemble and Hollowed Point, that make it. It\u2019s also got some of Slayer\u2019s most fun sonics: the way lead guitar notes leap out of the surge of churning riff like spurts of lava from a boiling hellscape demonstrates their key skill of making extreme musicianship come off as audacity rather than onanism.</p> <p><strong>God Hates Us All (2001)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfKUWvVCwvE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WfKUWvVCwvE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Appropriately for a band who take metal to the nth degree, Slayer\u2019s career has been turbulent \u2013 from Lombardo\u2019s multiple splits from the band to Hanneman\u2019s troubles with arthritis, necrotising fasciitis, and the alcoholism that eventually killed him. But, despite all this, their output has been remarkably consistent. Their only real fallow patch was the second half of the 90s, when they released only the decent enough punk covers album, Undisputed Attitude, and the sadly nu-metal-influenced Diabolus in Musica. But with God Hates Us All they returned to form spectacularly. Apart from religious psychosis replacing the slasher imagery, it\u2019s vintage Slayer. Lombardo\u2019s stand-in, Paul Bostaph, is especially keen to prove his worth. The sheer inhuman barrage of blastbeats on Disciple is one of the most adrenalising sounds in their catalogue, and even a slow track such as Seven Faces takes a terrifying pummelling. From here on, they kept delivering, with 2009\u2019s World Painted Blood \u2013 reconstituting the original lineup \u2013 an especially tight collection. Even their 2015 swansong, Repentless, though derided by metal critics as unadventurous at the time, still stands up as a top-drawer thrash record.</p> <p><strong>Live Undead (1984)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtIv9nz-ZjM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TtIv9nz-ZjM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>If ever there was a record that delivered the stink and bruises of the moshpit, this is it. Though the debut album Show No Mercy, and Hell Awaits which followed in 1985 both show Slayer pushing at the boundaries of what metal could achieve, it\u2019s clear that their live shows was where they truly cut loose: this is the lightning that they would finally successfully bottle on Reign in Blood. The total meshing of guitar maelstrom, Lombardo\u2019s machine-like kickdrum rolls, and Araya\u2019s Rob Halford scream at the climax of Antichrist must have been staggering to experience in the flesh, and it\u2019s no wonder the roar of the crowd, audible throughout, is so deranged.</p> <h2>One for the heads</h2> <p><strong>South of Heaven (1988)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03mS-ibqQxQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/03mS-ibqQxQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>While many bands insist that their latest album is their best, King has admitted, with an impressive lack of ego, that he was fine with the idea they might never top Reign in Blood. Nonetheless, it took them a while to get past its brilliance. With all eyes on them \u2013 thanks not only to Reign\u2019s success but to the meteoric rise of Rick Rubin and Def Jam \u2013 they chose not to replicate the previous glory but to slow things down. Oddly, it kind of sounds like Slayer making a Metallica album. It rarely takes flight like their best, but it is a fantastic record. It is more trad metal than Reign, but it still has the swaggering confidence to the playing \u2013 and it might even be a good point of introduction for the timid.</p> <h2>The primer playlist</h2> <p>For Spotify users, listen below or click on the Spotify icon in the top right of the playlist; for Apple Music users, <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/gb/playlist/listeners-digest-where-to-start-with-slayer/pl.u-WabZZGYUdlAjRqg\">click here</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/66UVLuNkhVv7DyQW2Y6rUs\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/66UVLuNkhVv7DyQW2Y6rUs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  <h2>Further reading</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/magazine/tribute-complete-untold-story-slayers-jeff-hanneman\">In Tribute: The Complete, Untold Story of Slayer\u2019s Jeff Hanneman</a>, by Jeff Kitts (2015)<br></strong>This memorial piece, published in Guitar World a year after Hanneman\u2019s death, is a perfect intro to Slayer\u2019s dysfunctional world, and to Hanneman\u2019s sweetly domesticated off stage life as well as his tragic decline.

But imagine what it must be like if you are deaf or have difficulty hearing.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.actiononhearingloss.org.uk/about-us/our-research-and-evidence/research-reports/working-for-change-report/\">Research published on Wednesday</a> by the charity Action on Hearing Loss found that three-quarters of people who live with deafness fear they will be less productive working from home. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/08/deaf-nurse-face-discrimination-nhs\">As a deaf nurse, I know what it's like to face discrimination in the NHS</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rob Geaney, head of campaigns and public affairs at Action on Hearing Loss, says: \u201cHome working is a huge challenge for people living with deafness or hearing loss. They are at greater risk of further isolation due to social-distancing measures. While many people will use phone and video calls to stay in contact with friends and families and work colleagues, people with hearing loss, especially those who lip-read or use British Sign Language, will be excluded from these interactions.\u201d</p> <p>Lip-reading requires an individual to concentrate intently on both the movement of the lips and the sound they can hear to piece together what is being said, Geaney explains. This is tiring and many people only get most of what is being said \u2013 with contextual clues being used to fill the gaps.</p> <p>\u201cIt is therefore helpful to consider using text boxes or visual presentations alongside video conferences, particularly if communicating numbers or complex jargon,\u201d he says.</p> <p>In the <a href=\"https://www.actiononhearingloss.org.uk/about-us/our-research-and-evidence/facts-and-figures/\">UK, 12 million people </a><a href=\"https://www.actiononhearingloss.org.uk/about-us/our-research-and-evidence/facts-and-figures/\">have hearing loss</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hearinglink.org/your-hearing/about-hearing/facts-about-deafness-hearing-loss/\">65% of working-age deaf people are employed</a>, compared with 79% of the general population. An estimated 24,000 people use BSL as their main language. The <a href=\"https://www.actiononhearingloss.org.uk/live-well/your-rights/the-equality-act-2010/\">Equality Act 2010</a> obliges employers to make adjustments (like a BSL interpreter or a speech to text reporter) and the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.actiononhearingloss.org.uk/live-well/benefits-and-grants/access-to-work/\">Access to Work</a> scheme provides grants for specialist equipment.</p> <p>\u201cTo make the workplace more accessible, face someone when speaking to them, speak one at a time in meetings, and don\u2019t give people a desk facing a wall but allow them to face into the office, so they can communicate,\u201d says Geaney.</p> <p>\u201cThe key thing for home working is that managers should feel able to talk to members of staff about their hearing loss and the adjustments that they need,\u201d he adds.</p> <p>But the charity\u2019s focus groups revealed a reluctance among employees to disclose hearing loss at work because of embarrassment, stress or fear that it might affect job prospects. One said: \u201cYou want to do a good job at work, you do not want anyone to see hearing loss as a weakness.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a hidden condition and many staff who have concealed their hearing loss and coped without any support might now need support to find adjustments that work for them,\u201d says Geaney. Similarly, those who had adjustments set up in their place of work might now need new adjustments put in place, such as an amplified telephone or handsets that can be linked to an individual\u2019s hearing aid. </p> <p>Behaviour changes that hearing colleagues could make include speaking one at a time, muting themselves when not speaking to reduce background noise, having a clear agenda to provide structure and contextual clues to what is being said. For video conferencing it is helpful if the camera is square-on and everyone is well lit from the front. If the source of light is behind the individual then faces might be in shadow.</p> <p>Action on Hearing Loss research suggests the biggest reason people are without support is that they feel colleagues lack the knowledge to help. Almost half of respondents surveyed said deaf awareness (\u201cinformation on educating your colleagues or managers\u201d) would help them fulfil their potential, and more than a third said support to manage the anxiety of hearing loss at work would help.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.citylit.ac.uk/\">City Lit</a> adult education college in central London holds an annual Deaf Day to raise awareness (although this year\u2019s has been postponed due to coronavirus). Founded in 1919, the college began running lip-reading classes for soldiers deafened in the first world war. Courses specifically for deaf people include BSL, English, maths and digital skills. There are 12 deaf tutors and six who are hearing (but teach in BSL) plus a network of BSL interpreters who offer support in meetings or job interviews. It also provides employment advice to its students in partnership with the <a href=\"https://royaldeaf.org.uk/rads-information-advice-guidance-service-city-lit-college-returns/\">Royal Association for Deaf people</a>. A bursary helps low-income deaf students pay course fees and travel.</p> <p>Mark Hopkinson, head of City Lit\u2019s Centre for Deaf Education, says solutions to better integrating deaf people at work rest on attitudes: \u201cSupport in the workplace depends on the organisation and ethos. Are hearing colleagues prepared to help with deaf colleagues?\u201d BSL, in particular, is vital, he says. \u201cSupposing you weren\u2019t allowed to speak for a number of years, [forced] to remain silent, how would you feel?\u201d</p> <p>English is often a second language for deaf people after sign language. But for Ilyaas Cader, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FshWxk2_43w&amp;feature=youtu.be\">a refugee from Sri Lanka</a>, his first language is Tamil Sign, his second BSL and his third English. \u201cI learned sign language first \u2013 that helped me learn the English. I had to learn English grammar, which is different from sign grammar,\u201d he tells me, using a BSL interpreter. </p> <p>Cader, 45, won a <a href=\"https://limpingchicken.com/2019/04/11/deaf-sri-lankan-refugee-honoured-at-city-lit-centenary-awards/\">City Lit centenary award</a> last year for outstanding achievement. He is a children\u2019s mental health worker in a specialist NHS unit for deaf children, and says his career is largely due to his time at City Lit. Without the specialist classes and support to get a job, he says, \u201cI definitely wouldn\u2019t be working in mental health where I\u2019m using my skills and my challenging experiences \u2013 barriers, emotional struggles, lack of access \u2013 to be a role model to children of how a deaf person can succeed.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/30/what-is-the-quality-of-mental-health-support-for-deaf-people\">What is the quality of mental health support for deaf people?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Deaf people are twice as likely to have mental health issues compared with hearing people, with communication barriers exacerbating symptoms like depression. There are also communication barriers for deaf people receiving mental health support. BSL interpreters are <a href=\"https://signhealth.org.uk/for-professionals/psychological-therapy/\">third parties in counselling sessions</a> designed to be one-to-one. This can affect treatment because the counselling can be less intimate. </p> <p>Cader believes that \u201caudism\u201d (negative attitudes towards deaf people) is deeply ingrained. More hearing professionals using sign language would help, he says.</p> <p>\u201cIf a deaf person needs to go to the doctor, they should be able to have a conversation with the doctor in their first language. And there should be more people like me out there doing the sort of work I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>As Sars-CoV-2 has spread across the world, some countries have reacted with alarm and thorough preparations, given their previous experiences with Mers or Sars. In these countries, such as South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Vietnam, containment of the novel coronavirus became the imperative, regardless of cost. However, other countries chose to treat it like a bad flu strain that would be unstoppable and spread across the population until some kind of immunity was reached.</p> \n<p>Much of the difference in countries\u2019 initial responses can be attributed to whether they \u201coverreacted\u201d, given prior experience with two other more deadly coronaviruses, or whether they perceived the novel coronavirus from the start as just posing a moderate to low risk to their populations and eventually becoming endemic.</p> \n<p>In the UK, the assumption until quite recently had seemed to be the latter. The containment phase ended on 12 March. At this point, testing ended for all those with minor symptoms (including frontline health staff), contact tracing stopped, airports remained open without checks on incoming flights or passengers, and physical distancing measures were ruled out. Large events involving tens of thousands of people went ahead a few days later, and non-essential travel continued. After considerable public pressure, lockdown measures were introduced on 23 March with the goal of keeping the coronavirus-related burden on health services within NHS capacity.</p> \n<p>Where are we now? According to official figures, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public\">16,509 people with Covid-19 have so far died</a> in British hospitals. There are no official statistics for deaths in the community, but ONS data <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52361519\">released today</a> shows that of 6,200 Covid-19-related deaths in the week to 10 April, one in six of them happened outside hospital. We are on track for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/health-52321600/coronavirus-we-could-see-40000-deaths-in-this-wave\">40,000 deaths</a> by just the end of the first wave of this outbreak, while also having to cope with the astronomical economic costs and heart-rending social implications of being in lockdown for weeks on end.</p> \n<p>In a significant number of confirmed Covid cases, the health outcomes are severe, the disease can result in multiple organ failure and long-term lung damage, and the clinical need of patients for oxygen, ICU care and ventilators is much higher. Early clinical management of symptoms, to which Boris Johnson had access, means that outcomes are generally better, but that requires testing at an early stage of the disease.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"28f9c4c8-d8b6-4f17-bdd6-1264330215a7\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/akiXEfWW-V0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>New Zealand is in the enviable position of having fewer than 20 deaths, while Australia has managed to stay under 100. With early physical distancing measures and border control, and aggressive testing, tracing and isolating procedures in place, these countries are in a better position to ease lockdown earlier and get their economy and society going again, while keeping Covid-19-related deaths low. That\u2019s as close to a win-win situation as a government can have right now.</p> \n<p>However, when these international comparisons are made, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-adrwale_c\">some in government</a> say that it is still too early to say how countries are performing, and others say that all countries will be in the same place, and any variation will depend on their healthcare capacity. It is worth thinking through the long-term scenarios for the future of Covid-19.</p> \n<p>The first scenario: if we have an effective, safe and available vaccine or antiviral in the next 18 months, the countries that minimised loss of life with the least harsh economic restrictions will be in the best position. Australia, New Zealand and numerous east Asian countries have the outbreak under control and can in the short term manage the trickle of cases while waiting for the scientific solution.</p> \n<p>The second scenario: in the absence of a vaccine or antiviral, some kind of population immunity will be built up so that the virus is not actively transmitting at a high level. This assumes that having the coronavirus leads to immunity for at least two or three years and that subsequent reinfection is mild. Even in this situation, the countries with low numbers of cases can wait for ongoing research on better identification of who is exactly \u201cvulnerable\u201d to developing severe symptoms, and shield these individuals so the burden on ICU care and loss of life are kept to a minimum. While we have some basic idea at population level about who is vulnerable, based on age and pre-existing conditions, scientists do not understand the individual genetic or immunological factors yet.</p> \n<p>The third (worst-case) scenario: research might find that there is no lasting immunity to the virus, or in fact immune enhancement, which means subsequent reinfections would be more severe (similar to dengue). This creates a real case for countries with the capacity to eliminate the virus and keep in place border controls . Obviously the fewer cases present, the easier it is to eliminate a virus, and in this situation a precautionary approach to letting it spread through the population would have been well warranted.</p> \n<p>In short, there are huge gaps in what we know about this virus, including about immunity, about the possibility and timeline for a vaccine or antiviral therapy, about who exactly is vulnerable, and about long-term health implications. For example, Italian scientists have warned that some patients are developing Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (temporary paralysis) as a side effect of Covid-19.</p> \n<p>In this uncertainty, countries that are actively working to contain this virus and keep numbers as low as possible are buying time to build a more informed policy response while also protecting their economies and societies. Others, by letting the virus spread slowly through their populations (only flattening the curve instead of completely stopping the spread), are just gambling with people\u2019s lives, and will be caught in cycles of lockdown/release that will destroy the economy and cause social unrest, as well as increased Covid-19- and non-Covid-19-related deaths.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh</p> \n<p><br><br></p>",

  "<p>Were she another kind of person, Jameela Jamil would have an easy life. Everything seemed to be going her way. First came the break that led to a job presenting Channel 4\u2019s Saturday morning hangover slot, T4, which was followed by a job on Radio 1, before a swift, and unexpected, move to become an actor on the hit US sitcom The Good Place. Yet barely a month goes by without Jamil popping up to ignite some controversy or inflame the kind of commentator incensed by any hint of perceived \u201cwokeness\u201d.</p> <p>February was a particularly difficult month. First, she came out as queer, which appeared to infuriate many people. Then she had to defend herself against accusations she had Munchausen\u2019s syndrome \u2013 a psychiatric disorder in which people feign illness \u2013 an allegation started by a writer who didn\u2019t believe her history of health problems. She ended the month embroiled in a Twitter row with Piers Morgan (public feuds being something of a natural stomping ground for both) after the death of TV presenter Caroline Flack.</p> <p>Does Jamil ever feel like living a quieter life? \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy path,\u201d she says. \u201cYou get hurled up on to a pedestal and it always feels a bit like a trap \u2013 it\u2019s very high, it\u2019s easy to slip off and it\u2019s a long way down. I\u2019m just learning, I\u2019m not the authority on anything.\u201d She has not, she says, \u201chandled myself perfectly at all times, but I am a human, prone to error\u201d.</p> <p>We talk on the phone, with Jamil calling from her home in Los Angeles, which she shares with her boyfriend, the musician James Blake and three friends. The lockdown has not been too difficult, she says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t feel more privileged right now. I\u2019m safe, I have a house. I can afford to not work for a while and I have my health,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cOn a more frivolous note, I\u2019m really happy that handshaking is kind of cancelled for ever.\u201d It has always appalled her, she says, and her explanation is something I have never considered before and will never be able to forget. \u201cThe fact you know that a hand has been on a dick at some point before touching your hand is deeply unsettling,\u201d she says with a laugh, going on to describe it as \u201ca sort of penile imprint upon your palm\u201d. She has always succumbed to polite convention when someone puts their hand out. \u201cNever again.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7ec03f542c3d66883ce75d11d372ed7641f9330\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7ec03f542c3d66883ce75d11d372ed7641f9330/0_100_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jameela Jamil with Ted Danson in The Good Place.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jameela Jamil with Ted Danson in The Good Place.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She is excited, too, about the possible return of women\u2019s body hair, saying that \u201cwe\u2019re coming out of this furrier, chubbier, spottier and hopefully alive. And that\u2019s great \u2013 we are the lucky ones.\u201d Might it mark the end of the ridiculous grooming ideals (the lip fillers, the weirdly immaculate eyebrows)? \u201cFor women who have transitioned, I think not having access to aestheticians is really difficult. But I think some women are becoming used to seeing their faces without makeup, and realising that you don\u2019t need all of the nonsense that we have flogged at us.\u201d</p> <p>Mostly she hopes that \u201cour value systems are going to shift. Celebrities have been hero-worshipped, and now it has become very obvious who the true heroes are. And I think celebrities are consistently making arses of themselves.\u201d I would be happy never to see a certain kind of influencer again, I say. \u201cWho is going to have the money for cellulite cream, fillers or detox teas? No one\u2019s going to want to see your $300 bikini any more. The way that we have looked up to money, fame and materialism \u2026\u201d She pauses. \u201cI think that\u2019s gone overnight because we don\u2019t have the luxury any more. We\u2019re talking about life or death. This is a depression. [Celebrities] need to shut up and open their purses.\u201d (Jamil is donating to refugee and domestic violence charities.)</p> <p>She has a new podcast, which started at the beginning of the month, and she will soon launch a YouTube show. (\u201cIs there anything sadder than a 34-year-old trying to start a YouTube channel?\u201d she laughs.) Both come under her I Weigh movement, a campaign that started on Instagram in 2018 to promote the idea that people, especially women, should be \u201cweighed\u201d by their achievements rather than the number on their bathroom scales \u2013 and to promote inclusivity, social justice and mental health. </p> <p>The latest episode of the podcast features Reese Witherspoon talking about postnatal depression and her experience of sexism in the entertainment industry. Future interviews will be with the writer Roxane Gay, Gloria Steinem and the founder of the #MeToo movement, Tarana Burke. It is a sign of Jamil\u2019s influence that she simply made a wishlist of people she wanted to interview, and they said yes. \u201cI got creepy in the DMs [direct messages],\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cI have absolutely no shame, and it\u2019s great that the podcast is about ridding yourself of shame. This is also a podcast that is supposed to offer hope. We\u2019re showing someone\u2019s journey from the darkness towards the light.\u201d</p> <p>If her guests seem to open up, it is probably because Jamil herself is incredibly candid. In the episode with Vivek Murthy, the former surgeon general of the US and author of Together, a book about loneliness, Jamil talks about trying to kill herself at 26. In other episodes, she talks about the eating disorder she had as a teenager. It is almost easy to see why the conspiracy theory that she has Munchausen\u2019s syndrome took off; she has been through so much, almost too much for one person.</p> <p>She attended an independent girls\u2019 school in London (on a scholarship; she and her brother were mostly brought up by their mother, a school secretary) where she says she was the victim of racist bullying that was physical and violent. She was abused as a child, and was later the victim of several sexual assaults. She has said she is a multiple rape victim. At 17, she was hit by a car, severely damaging her spine, and spent more than a year recovering. Mental illness led to the attempt to kill herself in her mid-20s, at which point she sought therapy. She also went through several painful operations as a child to deal with hearing loss, and has coeliac disease and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which affects the body\u2019s connective tissues.</p> <p>In revealing so much about herself, she \u2013 unwittingly or not \u2013 places herself at the centre of many experiences. She may say, not unreasonably, that being so open reduces stigma, but it can also look like attention-seeking and self-promotion. This appeared to be what prompted the backlash when Jamil came out as queer. She had been criticised on social media for her appointment as a judge on Legendary, a TV competition inspired by black LGBT ballroom and vogueing culture. To all appearances, Jamil was a heterosexual cis woman who had been in a relationship with a man for five years. Jamil is not interested in justifying herself or how she identifies. (\u201cStaying away from that question,\u201d she says good-naturedly when I bring it up.) But was she surprised by the reaction?<strong> </strong>\u201cNo, I understood, because of the timing. I was never trying to divert from [the criticism]. I was just trying to add to the conversation; that I\u2019m not saying this qualifies me as a part of ballroom [culture], but you don\u2019t actually know my sexuality.\u201d</p> <p>She had not come out before \u201cbecause I was worried that people would think I was jumping on a trendy bandwagon. And various other reasons. So I understand the pushback.\u201d What she didn\u2019t understand, she says, were the claims she was a liar. \u201cWhat a weird lie,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t help to identify yourself in any way in an industry that still discriminates against people. But the rest of it, I understood. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t come back complaining.\u201d</p> <p>The same criticisms around appropriation have surrounded Jamil\u2019s campaigning on body image when she herself is slim and conventionally beautiful. She has been accused of shaming other women \u2013 most damagingly black women, such as the rapper CupcakKe (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/19/eating-disorders-have-been-rebranded-as-fasting-but-they-are-as-dangerous-as-ever\">after the entertainer announced she had been on a 40-day \u201cwater fast\u201d</a>) without acknowledging that the <a href=\"https://theglowup.theroot.com/black-bodies-will-not-be-your-platform-jameela-jamil-1839940296]\">policing of black women\u2019s bodies comes with its own painful history</a>.

(In October, for instance, she explained she knew <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/10/jameela-jamil-remains-unapologetic-not-knowing-george-bushs-history-10895881/\">little about George W Bush\u2019s presidency</a> after being embroiled in another Twitter row.) Using her platform, particularly as one of the most high-profile women of south Asian heritage in the western media, puts her in a tricky position. Does she speak out about airbrushing and start feuds with the Kardashians over the diet products they promote \u2013 and risk making mistakes \u2013 or keep quiet? \u201cI\u2019ve asked repeatedly for magazines to put me on the cover with women of different body shapes, and with disabilities, and they say no. So either no one has the conversation or I do the photoshoot by myself because then at least the conversation gets had.\u201d People have been impatient, she says; her YouTube show will provide a platform for other activists. \u201cYou have to take hold of the mic first before you can pass it,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Jamil is so divisive, seemingly equally championed by those who like her openness and sense of humour (she is not an earnest sort of activist), and vilified by those who think she is endlessly virtue-signalling for her own gain. Blake sometimes steps in. (After the Munchausen\u2019s rumour went viral, he posted: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty disgusting to watch the woman I love just be dog piled on every day.\u201d) Would she rather he didn\u2019t? She laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t want it to impair his career in any way just because I\u2019m in a controversy. But it must be difficult to see people hurt someone you love. I\u2019m very lucky to have someone this diehard in my corner.\u201d</p> <p>She says she is \u201cabsolutely fine\u201d dealing with the fallout if she feels in the wrong. \u201cIt\u2019s when it\u2019s a lie, a smear campaign \u2013 that doesn\u2019t sit well with me because that\u2019s the technique of discredit. We make [women] sound crazy and unhinged, and we try to devalue their word and their work.\u201d There must be days, I say, when it gets too much. \u201cI\u2019d say the Munchausen\u2019s thing. The Caroline Flack thing really upset me because we were on good terms.\u201d</p> <p>They had not really spoken \u201cjust because of what had been going on\u201d, says Jamil (in October, Jamil had criticised a cosmetic surgery show Flack would be presenting). \u201cShe reached out to me with a message of such love, and she passed away that week.\u201d The next week, Piers Morgan posted text messages from Flack on Twitter, sent to him last year saying she was \u201cstruggling\u201d with Jamil, \u201cas if I was any contribution to her passing, when I\u2019d never instigated any kind of argument with Caroline. I don\u2019t criticise the host, I criticise the show.\u201d She says she didn\u2019t publish Flack\u2019s last message to her \u201cbecause I\u2019m not a scumbag\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m not doing this for popularity. I\u2019m doing this so that I can undo the stuff that I saw when I was younger</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ultimately, she says, she will not shut up. Outspoken women, and especially outspoken women of colour, are disproportionately attacked online. \u201cThat isn\u2019t just about the woman they are vilifying,\u201d says Jamil. \u201cIt\u2019s also a deliberate message they are sending out to all other women to not speak out, to not stand for something, to not break the rules. And that\u2019s why I can\u2019t back down now, because otherwise it would say that it wasn\u2019t worth it and that I shouldn\u2019t have stuck my neck out.\u201d</p> <p>The car accident partly explains her resilience. \u201cHaving a near-death experience gives you a strong perspective,\u201d she says. \u201cBeing dragged on Twitter or being embarrassed on television \u2013 or rejection \u2013 nothing scares me any more. So I think it made me very bold.\u201d She was also inspired by Yes Man, the memoir by Danny Wallace in which he spent a year saying \u201cyes\u201d. It partly explains her decision to move to the US and dare to audition for The Good Place, having never acted before. \u201cI am definitely more surprised [at my career] than any of you could ever be.\u201d</p> <p>But it was her breakdown in her mid-20s that became the bigger pivotal moment. \u201cAfter that, I realised it was very much do or die, and I had to investigate everything that had led me to such a low point,\u201d she says. \u201cOne of those things was shame. You place the blame upon yourself, especially when you\u2019re very young. But also just shame for being a woman. You\u2019re too skinny, you\u2019re too fat, you\u2019re not smart enough or you\u2019re too smart. I completely accept my own fuck-ups, but a lot of things that have caused a lot of trauma are not my fault.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s why she does what she does, she says \u2013 the social-media posts that sometimes strike the wrong note, the fights, the campaigns. \u201cImportant conversations feel uncomfortable. And therefore we leave young people unarmed.\u201d She would like to work on syllabuses for schools \u201cso that we don\u2019t learn more about igneous rock than we learn about consent, eating disorders and the lies of social media\u201d.</p> <p>What next for Jamil? She has built up a large social-media following and something of a power base. If it is to further her acting career, constantly criticising many aspects of the entertainment industry would be a funny way of going about it. So no nice, easy life for her. \u201cI would do certain things differently,\u201d she says. \u201cI would rather start the fights that I start and sometimes get into the trouble that I get into than sit here silently and be complicit in an industry that pumps so much toxicity into the world.\u201d She understands some people\u2019s wariness of her, she says. \u201cI look like the enemy. I\u2019m a slim, privileged person who exists within this industry; I totally get the mistrust. I will just have to do the work to prove I wasn\u2019t such a shitbag after all. I\u2019m not doing this for popularity. I\u2019m doing this so that I can undo the stuff that I saw when I was younger, that made me unwell, and try to change it.\u201d</p> <p>There is a smile in her voice as she says: \u201cAnd sometimes you have to be annoying and attention-seeking in order to instigate that change.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Jameela Jamil\u2019s I Weigh podcast is hosted at <a href=\"https://www.earwolf.com/show/i-weigh-with-jameela-jamil/\">www.earwolf.com</a></p> <p>\u2022 In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.ie\">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

We had expected the early months of parenthood to be tiring and dull and unadventurous. We had not contemplated that our boy might go months without meeting another person; that we might spend months without the support and love of our extended families.</p> <p>The boy is a first grandchild on both sides. My parents have been expectant grandparents for more than a decade. In his first few months, we had repeated visits from family members and friends from across the country. Our introduction to parenthood was a full house of people bringing freezer meals and staying for afternoon tea; an endless stream of baby gawkers and helpers to do loads of washing or give the house a vacuum.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/20/farewell-workplace-burnout-will-coronavirus-slow-the-manic-pace-of-our-modern-lives\">Farewell, workplace burnout: will coronavirus slow the manic pace of our modern lives? | Johanna Leggatt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then the visits stopped, the world folded in on itself, and we were left on our own.

It is another to be able to place your child in loving arms, or to call on someone at a pinch, if one of us is unwell or tired or just needs to put the screaming little shit down. Such a situation can snowball. You heap exhaustion upon exhaustion because you have a child now and there\u2019s no other option.</p> <p>Both his parents are proud introverts and thought isolation might not really affect our inward-looking little lives. We\u2019re more comfortable at home on a Friday night; eager to be friendly rather than close friends with most people in our orbit.</p> <p>We live in a quiet neighbourhood in north Brisbane, and we have made some friends locally.

We hope he\u2019s OK but don\u2019t know his name.</p> <p>Most introverts like us aren\u2019t bereft of the desire to be surrounded by people \u2013 it\u2019s just that we prefer the small circles of those we know and love, and who make us comfortable.</p> <p>Isolation is a saddening experience even for those of us without expansive social lives. It\u2019s odd to crave the resumption of awkward conversations at the cafe.</p> <p>In isolation, your world shrinks. We cannot take our child to the cafe for him to be admired by friends, or for us to be pitied by strangers when he takes a turn towards tantrum.</p> <p>Our boy cannot be held by our parents, or anyone really but us.

  "<p>Mosques will be deserted, daylong fasts will be broken in isolation and in some places the calls to prayer that rally believers together will end with a different exhortation: worship from where you are.</p> <p>Ordinarily during Ramadan, the holy month that commences this week, Muslim community life swells with special prayers at mosques and crowded <em>iftar </em>dinners that can stretch into the early hours.</p> <p>But that kind of socialising now risks spreading coronavirus, and bans on religious and family gatherings will persist across much of the Islamic world even as businesses and government offices start to reopen.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult and depressing,\u201d said Mohammad Faoury, who works for a refugee organisation in Amman, Jordan. \u201cSince I\u2019m single and live alone, Ramadan is the month when I can finally see my family for extended periods of time. It\u2019s a time we strengthen the bond.\u201d</p> <p>The virus has emptied Islam\u2019s holiest sites at the most sacred time of year. The Ka\u2019bah, the gold-embroidered shrine in Mecca\u2019s Grand Mosque, is closed to worshippers along with the Prophet\u2019s Mosque in Medina and Jerusalem\u2019s al-Aqsa mosque.</p> <p>\u201cOur hearts are tortured from pain in the holy month of Ramadan,\u201d said Sheikh Omar al-Kiswami, the imam and director of al-Aqsa, where only guards and mosque employees will be permitted to pray. \u201cIt is a very sad moment in the history of Islam.\u201d</p> <p>Jamia Masjid, one of the oldest and grandest mosques in the disputed south Asian territory of Kashmir, usually overflows in the evenings with people gathering for prayer and discussing religion, politics and life. This month it will sit silent for the first time in living memory.</p> <p>\u201cIn Ramadan I would pray all five times of the day at Jamia and would also do <em>iftar</em> there, but this time it is a matter of life and death,\u201d said Fatima, 74, from Srinagar. \u201cThere is danger outside and the best thing is to stay home, stay quiet.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e1a94259d25b4ae76527bdfc3f9d3bfb950e300\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e1a94259d25b4ae76527bdfc3f9d3bfb950e300/0_0_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A locked gate at Jamia Masjid in Srinagar\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A locked gate at Jamia Masjid in Srinagar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dar Yasin/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Indonesia has banned <em>mudik</em>, an annual homecoming in which tens of millions of people travel to see their families for Eid-al-Fitr, the festival that marks the end of the fasting month.</p> <p>Across Israel and Palestine, mosques \u2013 as well as churches and synagogues \u2013 have been closed. Abdullah Abu Galous, a 38-year-old hardware shop owner from the Palestinian city of Ramallah, said it felt as if Ramadan had been cancelled.</p> <p>\u201cI would never have thought that a tiny virus could stop us from celebrating the month of Ramadan. It has held more than one billion Muslims throughout the world hostage,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Authorities in Turkey have so far resisted calls for a total lockdown, insisting the wheels of the economy must keep turning. But Ramadan will be marked by a new four-day lockdown starting from Thursday night, during which families will not be able to travel to eat and celebrate together without risking fines or arrest.</p> <p>The emergency has raised unprecedented issues for many of the religion\u2019s 1.8 billion adherents as they prepare to abstain from food and water during sunlight hours.</p> <p>Several Arab newspapers have carried expert assurances that fasting has not been shown to reduce resistance to the virus. Al-Azhar, Egypt\u2019s top Sunni mosque, said last week that coronavirus could not be used as an excuse not to participate unless it was scientifically established that drinking water helps to ward off the disease.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18670e420052d0b77b0a4d45ec055b6aca24fe00\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18670e420052d0b77b0a4d45ec055b6aca24fe00/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Women shopping in Baghdad after lockdown measures were partially eased\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Women shopping in Baghdad after lockdown measures were partially eased.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Khalid al-Mousily/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lockdowns have curtailed the production schedules of some of the soap operas that are a staple of Ramadan evenings in many homes, leaving TV executives scrambling to fill airtime during their most lucrative advertising season.</p> <p>But the inability to pray and eat together may be most keenly felt. In the UK, the Muslim Council of Britain has encouraged people to hold virtual <em>iftars</em> on social media.</p> <p>More than 1,400 people have signed up for nightly <em>iftar</em> broadcast of the call to prayer, and guest speakers are being organised over Zoom by the UK-based Ramadan Tent Project, with the option for viewers to split off into smaller group discussions. \u201cJust because you\u2019re in quarantine, it doesn\u2019t mean you have to spend Ramadan alone,\u201d said Rohma Ahmed, a spokeswoman for the project.</p> <p>Abu Ibrahim, 32, said he was keeping this year\u2019s difficulties in perspective. In 2011 he observed Ramadan under airstrikes in Dara\u2019a, southern Syria. The following year he spent the first day of the month dodging Syrian army patrols to escape on foot to Jordan.</p> <p>\u201cPeople say, how are we going to get through this Ramadan when we can\u2019t see each other, when there\u2019s a health risk,\u201d he said. \u201cWe used to put food on the table and hear the sound of bombing.

If it happens in a land where you are, then do not go out of it,\u2019\u201d Thyabat said.</p> <p>\u201cSimilarly, if we know that Muslims who eat garlic and onion are advised not to go to mosques because the bad breath will hurt mosquegoers, it is easy to conclude that you cannot go to the mosque when there is the risk of spreading contagious disease.\u201d</p> <p>In a faith without formal hierarchies, not all Islamic leaders share Thyabat\u2019s interpretation. Hundreds of worshippers continue to turn out for prayers in Herat, Afghanistan, where a hardline preacher, Mujib Rahman Ansari, recently advised his followers that death from coronavirus was a form of martyrdom.</p> <p>In neighbouring Pakistan, the government has compromised with clerics by lifting a ban on group prayers during Ramadan on condition that no carpet is laid, children and older people stay away and worshippers wear masks and keep six feet apart.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f2543fc6032f78096e3cedb0eb45c87a200d3a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f2543fc6032f78096e3cedb0eb45c87a200d3a8/0_0_5487_3293/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Worshipers offer noon prayers at a mosque in Rawalpindi, Pakistan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Worshipers offer noon prayers at a mosque in Rawalpindi, Pakistan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anjum Naveed/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Maulvi Haider Zaman, a prayer leader in Islamabad, said coronavirus was \u201cnot an issue\u201d and insisted it was important people still came to offer prayers during Ramadan.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are not afraid to perform their prayers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be imposing social distancing in the mosque but I don\u2019t think it is needed as coronavirus will not affect people in mosques.

One way could be to bank the genetic lineages of species by freezing sperm and egg deposits and then later thawing and combining them in a dish to create offspring.</p> <p>Amphibians are at the forefront of an uphill battle against extinction, losing a greater proportion of species than any other vertebrate group. <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/\">The IUCN</a> estimates that at least 41% of amphibians are at imminent risk of extinction. Habitat loss, climate crisis and a fungal disease all play a role in their demise.</p> <p>But amphibians are not the only species that can benefit from new technologies.

A year ago in Puerto Rico, researchers captured six male toads, injected them with hormones and then collected the sperm they ejected when they urinated. The toads usually pee when picked up by humans, but the researchers also barked at them, Kouba explains, as toads urinate when frightened, and dogs barking are a sure-fire way to scare them. The males were then released back into the wild.</p> <p>The team of international scientists preserved the semen in liquid nitrogen and transported it to <a href=\"https://www.fortworthzoo.org/\">Fort Worth </a><a href=\"https://www.fortworthzoo.org/\">zoo</a>, where female toads were injected with hormones to release eggs. Olaf and his roommates were created in a dish, eliciting cheers from the scientists when they hatched from their eggs.</p> <p>The idea of creating a frozen zoo first emerged in the 1970s, when a medical pathologist named Kurt Benirschke started banking animal sperm and eggs at San Diego zoo in the same way that human gametes were starting to be stored: in giant vials of liquid nitrogen that dropped the temperature of the materials to -196 F. When Benisrschke started banking genetic material, no technology existed to make use of it, but he believed it was important to carry on anyway.</p> <p>Now, biobanks for animal species \u2013 from fish to reptiles to birds and even snails and molluscs \u2013 are popping up around the globe. The <a href=\"https://institute.sandiegozoo.org/resources/frozen-zoo%C2%AE\">Frozen Zoo repository</a> at San Diego zoo holds more than 10,000 cell cultures from nearly 1,000 different species.

IVF success rates for mammals are much higher than with reptiles, and with some species, it\u2019s incredibly low. Even within species, some cells are more difficult than others. When it comes to amphibians, Kouba says, their sperm is pretty simple to freeze \u2013 but eggs are not, because they are so much larger than the sperm. \u201cInside that cell, you have water content, and when you start to freeze anything with water, they form ice crystals that rupture the cell.\u201d</p> <p>Because fish such as salmon and cod are widely available commercially, they have been studied much more than amphibians, and amphibian researchers like Barber and Kouba are waiting for breakthroughs that they can adopt. \u201cThere is a huge interest in freezing sperm to move genetics around the world for commercially viable species,\u201d Kouba says. </p> <p>One reason that conservationists want to boost the numbers of amphibian populations is because diseases are devastating them in the wild. Kouba says cryopreservation has a place as a last-ditch effort to bank the remaining genetic material from a dying species, but that it is really better to take action before a species\u2019 numbers have crashed. \u201cWe can produce tens of thousands for reintroduction, which may allow a species to return to a healthy population,\u201d he says.</p> <p>That\u2019s because amphibians have a naturally high mutation rate, so sending thousands of amphibians into the wild to mate and repopulate could mean they create a disease-resistant strain on their own. \u201cYou release animals with the hope that disease resistant lines will develop, and those animals will reproduce,\u201d says Kouba.</p> <h2>Healthy herds</h2> <p>In Colorado, Jennifer Barfield is using IVF to create bison with healthy genes to introduce into existing wild herds. Left to their own devices, bison breed well but what they can\u2019t do is move around the globe \u2013 so to transport new genes to different areas requires the use of IVF.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"04c780465192cae7518559fe2a7a0484ae19169d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04c780465192cae7518559fe2a7a0484ae19169d/0_0_1920_1278/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Jennifer Barfield has helped establish the Laramie Foothills Bison Conservation Herd.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jennifer Barfield has helped establish the Laramie Foothills Bison Conservation Herd.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: William A Cotton/CSU Photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Using assisted reproductive technologies, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/profiles/jennifer-barfield-494744\">she has helped produce</a> healthy Yellowstone bison from ones that had a bacterial disease called brucellosis and established a new conservation herd in Colorado called the Laramie Foothills Bison Conservation Herd.</p> <p>There is another advantage to using IVF in bison says Barfield. \u201cBio-banking the genetic preservation is just a good idea, like a form of genetic insurance. You never know how science will advance to use that material in the future.\u201d</p> <p>She says that one of the challenges in endangered species is that often researchers don\u2019t know enough about the reproductive physiology of rare animals to apply solutions before the animals become extinct. \u201cYou can\u2019t experiment on endangered species,\u201d says Barfield.</p> <p>In some species, assisted reproduction is the last hope. There are only two remaining northern white rhinos left in the world, both female, both past reproductive age. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/11/scientists-use-ivf-procedures-to-help-save-near-extinct-rhinos\">Last year, researchers were able to harvest eggs</a> from one of the females and have created three embryos with frozen sperm from dead males. The embryos are now frozen, with the hope of implanting them into surrogate southern white rhino females later this year. The eventual goal is to create five animals that could live in the wild in Africa \u2013 a plan that could take decades to come to fruition.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f31529c23b1ab366c2bf5add47b6e86ac3206873\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f31529c23b1ab366c2bf5add47b6e86ac3206873/0_0_1600_1067/1000..jpg\" alt=\"The first calf in the world to be conceived via IVF using eggs and sperm from Yellowstone bison, in Soapstone Prairie Natural Area, Colorado.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The first calf in the world to be conceived via IVF using eggs and sperm from Yellowstone bison, in Soapstone Prairie Natural Area, Colorado.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: William A Cotton/CSU Photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Back at Fort Worth zoo, Barber carefully puts Olaf back in his cage in the isolation room. In the wild, Puerto Rican crested toads like Olaf spend 95% of their time in small holes between crushed rocks, coming out to feed at night and when it rains. In his home at the zoo, the staff have constructed small pyramids made from sections of white PVC pipes for Olaf and the other toads to hang out in. Of the toads that used to live in this room, 193 were recently shipped via FedEx back to Puerto Rico for reintroduction; now more are being raised here. Other rooms house frogs raised from other parts of North America, all in need of a population boost.</p> <p>Barber says that in the 1980s zoos thought of themselves as arks. \u201cThat was kind of the buzz word for zoos: we\u2019re becoming arks instead of just having animals for exhibit. We need to start doing more about thinking about conservation and maintaining species long term.\u201d</p> <p>But those arks are full, and more species need assistance \u2013 there\u2019s no space to keep animals just as an insurance policy. \u201cWe\u2019re not arks, we\u2019re life rafts,\u201d Barber says. \u201cAnd we have very limited seating.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f8251fb1341f0de221d86223331aaf61881e2a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f8251fb1341f0de221d86223331aaf61881e2a8/0_9_5081_3049/1000..jpg\" alt=\"The insemination of an egg from one of the last two remaining female of northern white rhinos using frozen sperm at the Avantea laboratory in Cremona, Italy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The insemination of an egg from one of the last two remaining female northern white rhinos using frozen sperm at the Avantea laboratory in Cremona, Italy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Calanni/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As she speaks about her passion for overlooked species, Barber\u2019s eyes fill with emotion. \u201cEspecially with the stuff that I work with \u2013 the creepy crawlies \u2013 most people wonder: why should we care? And it\u2019s like, well, we should care about everything because we\u2019re all connected. Sometimes it\u2019s just really hard to communicate why we should care and why it is our responsibility to try to mitigate things that we humans have caused.\u201d</p> <p>So far, IVF conservation work is only being done with about 10 species \u2013 but Kouba predicts it will become much more widespread in the next decade. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to become mainstream,\u201d he says, adding that it could become a primary resource for conservation. \u201cWe left those species in the world and we were able to collect their material, bring it back and put new founder lines back in the population, so we don\u2019t need to remove animals from the wild any more. </p> <p>\u201cThat will revolutionise how we manage wildlife.\u201d</p> <p><em>This story is a part of Covering Climate Now\u2019s week of coverage focused on climate solutions, to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.

  "<p>Donald Trump has announced a 60-day ban on immigrants seeking to live and work in America permanently, and said he could extend it depending on the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n<p>The US president framed the executive order, which he expects to sign on Wednesday, as an effort to protect American workers from foreign competition. He said it would apply only to those seeking green cards and not temporary workers, but he did not explain how those whose applications are currently being processed would be affected.</p> \n<p>\u201cBy pausing immigration, we will help put unemployed Americans first in line for jobs as America reopens \u2013 so important,\u201d Trump told reporters at Tuesday\u2019s coronavirus taskforce briefing. \u201cIt would be wrong and unjust for Americans laid off by the virus to be replaced with new immigrant labour flown in from abroad. We must first take care of the American worker.\u201d</p> \n<p>The \u201cpause\u201d would be in effect for 60 days, he added, after which the need for an extension or alternation would be reviewed \u201cbased on economic conditions at the time\u201d. Under questioning, he confirmed that he might then decide to add a further 30 days or more.</p> \n<p>Trump said: \u201cThis order will only apply to individuals seeking a permanent residency. In other words, those receiving green cards. Big factor. It will not apply to those entering on a temporary basis ... We want to protect our US workers and I think, as we move forward, we will become more and more protective of them.\u201d</p> \n<p>The president, who has long campaigned against illegal immigration and again touted his US-Mexico border wall at Tuesday\u2019s briefing, added that the move would help conserve medical resources for US citizens.</p> \n<p>About a million people were granted green cards last year. The biggest share are family-based immigration sponsorships for permanent residency of foreign nationals by their American spouses. Alexander Hunter-Mihali\u0107, a CNN producer, tweeted: \u201cMy wife\u2019s greencard renewal is being \u2013 or was being \u2013 processed. What does that mean for her?\u201d</p> \n<p>The remarks followed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/trump-says-he-will-impose-immigration-ban-in-bid-to-tackle-coronavirus\">an ambiguous tweet on Monday night</a> that caught his own officials by surprise and provoked an angry backlash from immigration rights groups and Democrats.</p> \n<p>Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee to take on Trump in November\u2019s election, said: \u201cRather than execute a swift and aggressive effort to ramp up testing, Donald Trump is tweeting incendiary rhetoric about immigrants in the hopes that he can distract everyone from the core truth: he\u2019s moved too slowly to contain this virus, and we are all paying the price for it.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"928adc644aca22aa6aba9e4cf0a370664efdc6de\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/928adc644aca22aa6aba9e4cf0a370664efdc6de/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A supermarket in Miami, Florida.

How many families would go without health care, food or otherwise if it wasn\u2019t for immigrants working alongside native-born Americans yesterday, today and tomorrow?\u201d</p> \n<p>Immigrants account for 17% of healthcare workers and 24% of direct care workers nationwide, Noorani added, while H-1B visa holders are helping to find a vaccine to Covid-19 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/us-coronavirus-outbreak-california-farm-workers\">agricultural workers continue</a> to be essential in maintaining food chains that re-supply grocery stores.</p> \n<p>Mayra Mac\u00edas, executive director of Latino Victory, said: \u201cTrump is once again using his old playbook of scapegoating immigrants to cover up his failures. But we will not be fooled \u2013 he\u2019s doing it to distract us from his disastrous response to the coronavirus pandemic.\u201d</p> \n<p>In practice, much of the US immigration system has already been paralysed by the pandemic.

Perhaps this one\u2019s not a good report but we\u2019ll be looking at it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dr Stephen Hahn, the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s commissioner, cautioned against drawing firm conclusions from the 368-patient sample. \u201cThis study is a small retrospective study at the VA [Veterans Affairs],\u201d Hahn said. \u2018This is something that a doctor would need to consider as part of a decision in writing a prescription for hydroxychloroquine.\u201d</p> \n<p>Earlier on Tuesday Trump hosted Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, at the White House, with testing top of the agenda. He said they agreed that the hospital ship USNS Comfort was no longer required by the state. \u201cI\u2019ve asked Andrew if we could bring the Comfort back to its base in Virginia so that we could have it for other locations and he said we would be able to do that.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be bringing the ship back at the earliest time and we\u2019ll get it ready for its next mission, which will I\u2019m sure be a very important one also.
