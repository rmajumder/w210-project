By throwing his weight behind Biden, Sanders, is sending a clear signal to his legions of loyal followers that they should align behind the party\u2019s nominee to defeat <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cToday, I am asking all Americans, I\u2019m asking every Democrat, I\u2019m asking every independent, I\u2019m asking a lot of Republicans, to come together in this campaign to support your candidacy, which I endorse,\u201d the senator from Vermont said, appearing via live stream on a split screen next to Biden, who was hosting the broadcast.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe need you in the White House,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make Trump a one-term president. I will do all that I can to make that happen.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sanders dropped out of the Democratic primary race last week after falling far behind Biden in the delegate count. In an effort to continue influencing the Democratic platform, he will remain on the ballot in states with remaining primaries to gain delegates.</p> \n<p>Biden, a former Delaware senator and vice-president, now the presumptive Democratic nominee for the White House, thanked Sanders for his support.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been the most powerful voice for a fair and more just America,\u201d Biden told Sanders. \u201cYou don\u2019t get enough credit, Bernie, for being the voice that forces us to take a hard look in the mirror.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cIf I am the nominee \u2013 which it looks like now you just made me \u2013 I really need you, not just to win the campaign but to govern,\u201d Biden told Sanders.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/07/joe-biden-skeptical-sanders-supporters\">\u2018I know what's at stake\u2019: can Biden win over skeptical Sanders supporters?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Biden still faces deep skepticism from young progressive voters, many of whom supported Sanders by lopsided margins. On Monday, Biden and Sanders announced that their staff had set up six taskforces to help find common ground on policy differences. Those groups will cover the economy, education, criminal justice, immigration, climate change and healthcare.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s no great secret out there, Joe, that you and I have our differences. And we\u2019re not going to paper them over, that\u2019s real,\u201d Sanders said.

In recent weeks, he has engaged top progressive organizations and movement leaders representing a range of Democratic causes from climate change to racial justice.</p> \n<p>He has also made overt gestures, adopting a plan by his former rival, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/elizabeth-warren\">Elizabeth Warren</a>, to overhaul the consumer bankruptcy system, embracing elements of Sanders\u2019 tuition-free college proposal and unveiling a plan to <a href=\"https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/joe-biden-outlines-new-steps-to-ease-economic-burden-on-working-people-e3e121037322\">lower</a> the age of eligibility for the Medicare government health insurance program for seniors from 65 to 60.</p> \n<p>Though there are indications Biden will continue to move left on issues like climate change, he is unlikely to adopt Medicare for All, Sanders\u2019 signature policy. Asked recently if the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> changed his position on universal healthcare, Biden said it hadn\u2019t and argued expanding the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/25/obama-healthcare-law-upheld-supreme-court\">Affordable Care Act</a> was still the most effective and efficient way to insure more Americans.</p> \n<p>In a sign of the work that lies ahead, the progressive New York congresswoman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alexandria-ocasio-cortez\">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a>, one of Sanders\u2019 most high-profile surrogates, called Biden\u2019s Medicare proposal \u201calmost insulting\u201d and said he would have to go much further if he expects a full-throated endorsement.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe whole process of coming together should be uncomfortable for everyone involved \u2013 that\u2019s how you know it\u2019s working,\u201d she said <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/us/politics/aoc-progressives-joe-biden.html\">in an interview with the New York Times</a>. \u201cAnd if Biden is only doing things he\u2019s comfortable with, then it\u2019s not enough.\u201d</p> \n<p>There are also limits to Sanders\u2019 ability to deliver the support of his devoted followers, particularly those attracted to his outsider status as an independent railing against the political establishment. Though Sanders has been careful not to attack Biden in personal terms, some of his most visible backers continue to assail the former vice-president, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/1249765850531405827\">raising questions </a>about his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/1242577865331412993\">mental acuity</a> and overall fitness \u2013 a line of attack that Trump has also used against his likely opponent.</p> \n<p>Despite a hard-fought primary, the former competitors and one-time Senate colleagues displayed sincere affection for one another \u2013 a warm relationship Sanders never shared with his 2016 rival, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\">Hillary Clinton</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cI appreciate your friendship, and I promise you I will not let you down,\u201d Biden told Sanders.</p> \n<p>In reply, Sanders said: \u201cI know you are the kind of guy who is going to be inclusive. You want to bring people in \u2013 even people who disagree with you.\u201d</p> \n<p>After exchanging questions on raising the minimum wage, and the US economy, they joked that they should end the live-cast by playing a game of chess.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll bore everybody for a few hours,\u201d Sanders said.</p>",

Of all the privations we are enduring as a people, the loss of county cricket should probably sit some way down the list. But there were times during the listless, gloriously sunny weekend when it was perhaps only natural to wonder, idly and hypothetically, how the opening day of the 2020 County Championship season was going.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/12/missing-live-sport-here-are-12-great-documentaries-to-watch-instead\">Missing live sport during lockdown?

Sibley v Philander at Taunton. Pujara v Maharaj at Headingley. Some 20-year-old seamer you\u2019d never heard of taking six for spit. England\u2019s top-order batting candidates falling over each other in a deluge of single-figure scores. Bumper bank holiday crowds. But perhaps what we missed above all was the promise and the hope, the sense of renewal and rebirth, the first chilly pint of the summer, the conviction that finally, this would be the year you made it to Wantage Road.</p> <p>Instead: nothing. A whispering void. The first seven rounds of the championship have already been called off. It\u2019s probably safe to say they won\u2019t be rescheduled. The talk is that with the shutdown poised to endure well into the summer, this year\u2019s competition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/apr/04/england-cricketers-willing-to-dig-deep-but-county-game-will-be-hit-hard\" title=\"\">will be scrapped entirely</a> in order to ensure the \u201cmost financially important forms of the game\u201d \u2013 essentially, England and the Twenty20 Blast \u2013 can be prioritised.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c364e0965ed3bbb8e7a7f927ef5cb4cdf14577b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c364e0965ed3bbb8e7a7f927ef5cb4cdf14577b/0_162_4928_2956/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fans watch Yorkshire play Surrey from their folding chairs at Scarborough last summer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fans watch Yorkshire play Surrey from their folding chairs at Scarborough last summer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allan McKenzie/SWpix.com/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At which point: what? The simplest answer is that, like most of the other events that have fallen to Covid\u201119, you simply skip a year and start afresh in 2021. But this would be to overlook the many aspects in which the championship is not like other events.</p> <p>In a way, it\u2019s unique. It\u2019s a competition that does not generate significant revenue, indeed it haemorrhages it in vast sums to the point where there are a number of counties who are quietly relieved not to be playing it. Unless you\u2019re watching extremely closely, it creates neither buzz nor water-cooler moments. It does not fill acres of broadcasting time. Sky are not banging down the doors of the ECB demanding it be played at all costs. It is not part of the national conversation and will not be part of our collective healing process.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/apr/04/england-cricketers-willing-to-dig-deep-but-county-game-will-be-hit-hard\">England cricketers willing to dig deep but county game will be hit hard | Vic Marks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The entire point of the County Championship, insofar as there is one, is to exist. It provides an ambient background hum to a busy season, quietly develops the next generation of international players, offers immeasurable comfort to the millions who will never set foot inside a ground and the thousands who do. In other words, it serves no wider purpose than simply to happen. And so when it doesn\u2019t happen, the effect is more seismic and disturbing than simply scratching off one Boat Race, one <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/01/wimbledon-2020-cancelled-response-coronavirus-pandemic-tennis\" title=\"\">Wimbledon</a>, one <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/01/tour-de-france-in-doubt-uci-announce-cycling-racing-suspension-until-june-coronavirus\" title=\"\">Tour de France</a>. The temptation, rather, is to wonder whether it will ever recover.</p> <p>This is after all a competition that has been tinkered to death \u2013 formats adulterated, schedules scrambled, rules tweaked, teams assembled and dissolved mid-season, whether through international availability or white\u2011ball blocks \u2013 only for that death to never materialise. This has generated an impression of timelessness and permanence, of an institution that can withstand pretty much anything you throw at it.</p> <p>But pandemic and penury have served up a starker, harsher reality. The talk coming from Lord\u2019s now is of \u201ckeeping the lights on\u201d, of redoubled priorities and focusing on what really matters. Where does a competition that stretches from April to September, takes up 14 weeks in the calendar, attracts tiny crowds and no broadcast income, fit into this new landscape? For decades the sport\u2019s administrators have treated four-day cricket like the unloved jar of piccalilli in the back of the fridge: ignored, untended, shoved to the forgotten peripheries. Now catastrophe may just embolden them to finish what they started.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>And really, this is about far more than one competition, one format, even one sport. It\u2019s about what happens when the doors are finally flung open and society clanks back into gear. What we choose to value. What it feels acceptable to fight for. Is it possible to aspire to more than simply keeping the lights on? Is it horrendously privileged to lionise the 18-county system and a proper first-class competition and sunny afternoons at Bristol and Hove when an entire sport is in crisis? Or are we doomed to a grim fight for survival, public bodies desperately trying to claw back lost income in increasingly undignified ways?</p> <p>\u201cWe must face the fact,\u201d said the secretary of Warwickshire at their annual end-of-season dinner, \u201cthat we are providing a spectacle the public does not want.\u201d That was in 1967. Then as now the championship offered the best, richest, most varied domestic red-ball cricket available anywhere on Earth. And yet decline \u2013 or at least the sensation of it \u2013 had long since taken root. Perhaps, in hindsight, the reckoning was coming all along. Perhaps one man\u2019s moment of chaos is another man\u2019s moment of clarity. Perhaps I should really have got to Wantage Road while I still had the chance.</p>",
  "<p>I am an intensive care unit doctor at Royal Preston hospital.

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Italy\u2019s death toll passes 20,000</h2> <p>The number of fatalities from coronavirus in Italy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-live-news-global-cases-italy-new-york-death-tolls-slow-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e9498a08f082dfd549d5a8e#block-5e9498a08f082dfd549d5a8e\">rose by 566 on Monday</a>, 135 more than on Sunday, bringing the total death toll to over 20,000. Almost half of the deaths (280) were registered in Lombardy, the northern region worst affected by the virus. The civil protection authority said the number of people who were currently infected had risen by 1,363 (1.3%) to 103,616, a further sign that the curve there is flattening.</p> <h2>Confirmed global death toll passes 116,000</h2> <p>At least 1.8 million people have been infected and 116,098 have died worldwide, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, who have been tracking official and media reports. The tallies are likely to be underestimates due to different testing regimes and suspected underreporting of figures.</p> <h2>UK hospital deaths top 11,000</h2> <p>A total of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-live-news-global-cases-italy-new-york-death-tolls-slow-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e946cc48f08db3109f21958#block-5e946cc48f08db3109f21958\">11,329 patients have died</a> in UK hospitals after testing positive, the UK\u2019s Department of Health said, up by 717 from 10,612 in 24 hours.</p> <h2>Belgium records 303 new deaths</h2> <p>Belgian health authorities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-live-news-global-cases-italy-new-york-death-tolls-slow-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e943efb8f082dfd549d56d7#block-5e943efb8f082dfd549d56d7\">reported 303 more deaths in 24 hours</a>, bringing the country\u2019s total death toll from the outbreak to 3,903. Its death toll is lower than those in other European countries and the US due to its smaller population, but proportionally, the outbreak is now more deadly than in Italy.</p> <h2>Singapore records biggest daily jump in infections</h2> <p>Health authorities in Singapore <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-live-news-global-cases-italy-new-york-death-tolls-slow-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e9490218f081a236f19297b#block-5e9490218f081a236f19297b\">confirmed 386 more cases</a>, the city-state\u2019s biggest daily jump since the outbreak began there. That takes its total to 2,918 cases. A large number of the new cases are linked to outbreaks in migrant workers\u2019 dormitories.</p> <h2>German experts recommend easing of restrictions</h2> <p>As time runs out on emergency measures to limit the outbreak in Germany, the country\u2019s National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-live-news-global-cases-italy-new-york-death-tolls-slow-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e947b688f081a236f192884#block-5e947b688f081a236f192884\">recommended a gradual relaxing of restrictions</a>, as long as new infections stabilise and personal hygiene measures are maintained.</p> <h2>WHO urges lockdown caution</h2> <p>The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-live-news-global-cases-italy-new-york-death-tolls-slow-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e9485b78f08db3109f21a59#block-5e9485b78f08db3109f21a59\">urged caution over moves to lift some lockdown conditions</a>.

  "<p>The cigar-shaped interstellar visitor to our solar system known as \u2018Oumuamua could be the remnants of a larger body that was torn apart by its host star, according to researchers.</p> <p>The dark, reddish object that hurtled into our solar system in 2017 and was named after the Hawaiian word for messenger or scout has long puzzled scientists.</p> <p>Among its peculiarities is the lack of an envelope of gas and dust that comets typically give off as they heat up. Further work by experts suggested the body was accelerated by the loss of water vapour and other gases \u2013 as seen with comets but not asteroids. The upshot was that \u2018Oumuamua was labelled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jun/27/scientists-solve-mystery-of-interstellar-object-oumuamua\">a \u201ccomet in disguise\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Now scientists say they have shed light on the mystery and addressed the myriad pieces of the \u2018Oumuamua puzzle.</p> <p>They say \u2018Oumuamua is an \u201cactive asteroid\u201d formed from a body that was torn apart by its parent star and then ejected into interstellar space.</p> <p>\u201cMost planetary bodies \u2026 consist of numerous pieces of rock that have coalesced under the influence of gravity. You could imagine them as sandcastles floating in space,\u201d said Dr Yun Zhang, a co-author of the new study from the Observatoire de la C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur in France.</p> <p>These bodies experience a number of forces as they pass their star.</p> <p>\u201cA tidal encounter between a planet or small body and a star is a tug-of-war game between the gravitational pull of the star and the self-gravity of the flyby body,\u201d said Zhang, noting that when the body passes too close to the star and enters the tidal disruption region, it can stretch and be torn apart giving rise to fragments.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-020-1065-8\">Writing in the journal Nature Astronomy</a>, Zhang and Prof Doug Lin of the University of California\u2019s Lick Observatory, report how they used computer models to reveal that such a process could have produced \u2018Oumuamua and explain features including its tumbling motion, colour and unusual shape.</p> <p>Zhang said near and far parts of \u2018Oumuamua\u2019s parent body would have been pulled apart from each other in the tidal disruption region, resulting in the formation of elongated fragments, such as \u2018Oumuamua, which would be glued together by surface material that melted near the star and froze as it flew on.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jun/27/scientists-solve-mystery-of-interstellar-object-oumuamua\">Scientists solve mystery of interstellar object 'Oumuamua</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Zhang said most of the volatile substances on \u2018Oumuamua\u2019s surface would have been lost from heating by the star around which it formed, but some residual water ice could have been preserved below its surface and subsequently heated by our, hotter, sun \u2013 explaining its unusual acceleration. \u201cWe may call \u2018Oumuamua an active asteroid,\u201d said Zhang.</p> <p>The team say \u2018Oumuamua could have formed from either a comet or a planet several times the size of Earth, but the former better explains \u2018Oumuamua\u2019s apparent subsurface water ice. The star around which \u2018Oumuamua formed, they add, would probably have been similar to our sun but smaller and denser \u2013 or possibly a white dwarf.</p> <p>Zhang says the findings not only scotch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/dec/14/is-oumuamua-an-alien-spacecraft-first-scans-show-no-signs-of-technology\">again</a> the much-publicised notion that \u2018Oumuamua is an alien spacecraft, but offer an efficient way in which asteroidal interstellar objects, previously thought to be rare, can be formed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/shortcuts/2018/nov/07/oumuamua-alien-spaceship-scientists-harvard-professors\">Do scientists really think \u2018Oumuamua is an alien spaceship?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What\u2019s more, she says, with objects such as \u2018Oumuamua passing through \u201chabitable zones\u201d, such as our own solar system, they may even carry seeds of life.</p> <p>Dr Alan Jackson, of Arizona State University, who was not involved in the study but has previously carried out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2018/mar/19/oumuamua-where-come-from-latest-update-two-star-system\">research into \u2018Oumuamua</a>, welcomed the work.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea of \u2018Oumuamua being a fragment of a larger body that was tidally disrupted by passing close to its parent star was suggested by Matija \u0106uk in 2018,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this is the first work that I have seen that really explores that idea in detail and shows that it might explain how \u2018Oumuamua was produced and a lot of its unusual features.\u201d</p>",

Regressive policies and enforcement procedures are being scaled back in surprising numbers. While sectors under federal control \u2013 immigration policy, higher education, healthcare, election reform \u2013 have had few Covid-related changes, those controlled by city and state governments \u2013 criminal justice, housing, transportation, utilities \u2013 have had many.</p> <p>These changes were put in place to slow viral transmission and stabilize the economy, not to benefit social welfare. But what\u2019s interesting is how much overlap there is between them. Sector by sector, the pandemic has unintentionally sparked changes pushed by reformers for decades. What couldn\u2019t be done in years has now happened in a matter of weeks. Policy changes that before Covid were dismissed as unreasonable are now seen not only as reasonable but as necessary.</p> <p>It shows us how <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/03/coronavirus-tsa-liquid-purell-paid-leave-rules.html\">absurd so many of our rules</a> were to begin with. But does it also show us how easy they\u2019ve been to change all along?</p> <p>Many of these changes still don\u2019t go far enough, come with caveats and fine print, are subject to absurd means-testing, or are only temporary. For those of us who believe that America needs serious change \u2013 and that this is the time to do it \u2013 what will it take to make many of these temporary changes permanent?

(Interestingly, America\u2019s free meal programs took off with the Black Panther party\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.eater.com/2016/2/16/11002842/free-breakfast-schools-black-panthers\">Free Breakfast for Children</a> program, which not only provided meals to students but also organized communities.)</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://theappeal.org/food-banks-surge-demand-coronavirus-covid-19/\">food banks are struggling to keep up with increased demand</a> \u2013 with cities such as Pittsburgh seeing a <a href=\"https://www.pittsburghfoodbank.org/2020/03/12/coronavirus/\">543% increase</a> \u2013 while shuttered restaurants and decreased demand for prepared food has led to food waste and <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/05/food-waste-coronavirus-pandemic-164557\">produce languishing in fields</a> against the usual backdrop of <a href=\"http://foe.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CA-Food-and-Farm-stimulus-4-sign-on-letter-final.pdf\">inadequately protected and paid</a> workers.</p> <h2><strong>Direct cash transfers</strong></h2> <p>There have also been a number of cash transfer program proposals to provide financial relief (a <a href=\"https://www.jainfamilyinstitute.org/media/research/comparing-cash-transfer-legislation/\">breakdown of the proposals is here</a>), many of which would have been unheard of just a few weeks ago.</p> <p>Unfortunately these proposals took the form of the recently passed Cares Act, which is both insufficient and means-tested. Its passage, however, further demonstrates that the \u201c<a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/03/27/coronavirus-stimulus-package-spending/\">how will you pay for it</a>\u201d question is more about stopping progressive policies than genuine concern.</p> <h2><strong>People with foreign medical degrees can provide hospital care</strong></h2> <p>As hospitals lack beds and equipment and millions of Americans lose their jobs \u2013 and thus their health insurance \u2013 the inadequacies and cruelty of the American healthcare system (if not already obvious) is now undeniable. However, to keep up with increased need, outdated restrictions have been relaxed or lifted.</p> <p>In New York, <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/gmaniatis/status/1242852834707746816\">people with foreign medical degrees are now allowed to provide hospital care</a> \u2013 foreign-trained medical workers with advanced degrees <a href=\"https://commonwealthmagazine.org/health-care/foreign-trained-medical-professionals-waiting-to-help/\">are often relegated to low-wage, precarious work, such as driving for Uber</a>, because their degrees aren\u2019t recognized in the US. <a href=\"https://www.niskanencenter.org/states-are-temporarily-letting-doctors-chase-covid-19-across-state-lines-make-it-permanent/\">Restrictions on medical workers working across state lines</a> have been relaxed as well, while <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/490824-fda-loosens-restrictions-on-gay-men-donating-blood-amid-coronavirus\">archaic restrictions on blood donation from gay men have been eased</a> (though not entirely removed).</p> <h2>Price of insulin capped</h2> <p>As the world scrambles for Covid-19 treatments, the pharmaceutical industry has tried to secure exclusive rights on anything that looks promising. Gilead, notorious among other things for its $84,000 hepatitis C treatment, applied for and received <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/03/23/gilead-sciences-coronavirus-treatment-orphan-drug-status/\">orphan drug status</a> for its possible Covid-19 treatment remdesivir, a status normally reserved for drugs that treat rare illnesses (Gilead later<a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/03/25/gilead-sciences-coronavirus-drug/\"> walked back the claim</a>).</p> <p>At the same time, Eli Lilly <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/medical-devices-and-prescription-drug-policy/491685-drugmaker-caps-insulin-costs\">capped insulin costs to $35</a> in response to the pandemic. Normally, Eli Lilly\u2019s (and other manufacturers\u2019) insulin is so unaffordable that <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/09/01/641615877/insulins-high-cost-leads-to-lethal-rationing\">people die from rationing it to save money</a>.<br></p> <h2><strong>Remote working and paid sick leave</strong></h2> <p>To maintain productivity throughout the pandemic, many employers previously resistant to remote work arrangements are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kwuchu/status/1240261206566461441\">suddenly open to them</a>. The expansion of remote work has been a long-denied <a href=\"https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/covid-19-is-proving-the-value-of-remote-work\">demand of disabled workers</a>, but only now are employers willing to consider it.</p> <p>Companies such as <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21175538/amazon-coronavirus-paid-sick-leave-all-employees-relief-fund\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/10/walmart-apple-olive-garden-are-among-major-employers-updating-sick-leave-policies-coronavirus-cases-spread/\">Walmart</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/10/21173287/instacart-coronavirus-sick-pay-workers-in-store-shoppers-covid19\">Instacart</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/07/tech/uber-coronavirus-sick-leave/index.html\">Uber</a> have revised their sick leave policies to include employees who are typically denied such benefits. But in basically all cases, this sick leave is accessible only after testing positive for Covid-19 (a difficult requirement given the scarcity of tests) and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/30/worker-strike-instacart-amazon-whole-foods/\">in the absence of other necessities like protective equipment and hazard pay</a>.</p> <p>Companies such as <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/why-uber-still-call-drivers-contractors/\">Uber persistently resist classification of their drivers as proper employees</a>, and this very limited expansion of benefits is not really a substantial change away from that policy. At the very least, however, the recently passed <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/blog/despite-some-good-provisions-the-cares-act-has-glaring-flaws-and-falls-short-of-fully-protecting-workers-during-the-coronavirus-crisis/\">C</a><a href=\"https://www.epi.org/blog/despite-some-good-provisions-the-cares-act-has-glaring-flaws-and-falls-short-of-fully-protecting-workers-during-the-coronavirus-crisis/\">ares Act expands unemployment benefits to independent contractors</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Many academic books accessible for free</strong></h2> <p>Education has been fundamentally reshaped as schools move online, with educators scrambling to adjust teaching styles and materials to remote learning. Many university presses have <a href=\"https://www.publicbooks.org/public-books-database\">made their titles accessible for free</a> in response. But most notable is the admittedly tiny \u2013 but unprecedented \u2013 shift in the system of indebtedness that American higher education system is built on.</p> <h2><strong>Debt collection suspended</strong></h2> <p>New York has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYGovCuomo/status/1239970795348094983\">suspended state debt collection</a>, including student and medical debt. At the federal level, initially a far more modest <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/487496-trump-waives-federal-student-loan-interest-in-response-to-coronavirus\">suspension of interest accrual</a> for federal loans was announced, but was <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/03/politics/student-loan-debt-suspension-economy/index.html\">updated to suspend payments and collections</a> as well.</p> <p>This still pales in comparison to measures taken by other countries, such as Venezuela, which announced <a href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/venezuela-prohibits-company-layoffs-and-suspends-credit-collections-over-coronavirus-2020\">country-wide six-month rent and credit payment freezes</a>. In the US, <a href=\"https://time.com/5814424/coronavirus-stimulus-student-loans/\">private lenders</a> are not required to take any such measures.</p> <p>Yet these moves seem to at least tacitly acknowledge the social harms of widespread debt burdens. This has not, however, stopped <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/03/27/debt-collection-industry-deems-itself-essential-to-financial-health-of-consumers-fights-covid-shutdown/\">the debt collection industry from trying to claim itself \u201cessential\u201d</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Free public transit</strong></h2> <p>City living is hugely influenced by access to reliable and affordable transit. Increased access to mobility has long been an important issue, but only now are we seeing changes.</p> <p>With pushback against fare hikes and ailing infrastructure already an issue before Covid, cities such as <a href=\"https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/transportation/article/texas-med-center-shuttle-coronavirus-houston-texas-15145695.php\">Houston</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2020/03/25/covid-19-metro-bus-fares-suspended-in-april/5077216002/\">Cincinnati</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-coronavirus-mta-nyc-buses-free-outbreak-20200320-a24jq7ksrzcpvgq7e2dyzq2uqy-story.html\">New York</a> and <a href=\"https://www.santamonica.gov/coronavirus-resources#transportation\">Santa Monica</a> have suspended bus fares, and some bike-share services are offering free rides, such as in <a href=\"https://mogodetroit.org/blog/free-monthly-pass/\">Detroit</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ExploreMemphis/status/1241130765104054275\">Memphis</a> and <a href=\"http://ridekcbike.com/2020/03/18/freerides/\">Kansas City</a>.

  "<p>Italian parliamentarians have urged the government to rescue people at sea amid fears that many migrants may have drowned over the weekend as they tried to make their way to Europe from Libya.</p> <p>EU member states have been accused of abandoning people at sea after failing to respond to information provided by NGOs that four boats, carrying 258 migrants between them, were in distress.</p> <p>Alarm Phone, a hotline service for migrants in distress at sea, lost contact with three of the boats between Friday and Sunday afternoon. About 47 people on the fourth boat were rescued on Monday morning by SMH, a Spanish NGO. In calls made to Alarm Phone from the boat, which was at sea in freezing temperatures for four nights, migrants said five people were unconscious and that a pregnant woman and her seven-year-old child were in need of urgent medical help.</p> <p>\u201cThey were really in a dire state,\u201d said Maurice Stierl, a researcher at the University of Warwick and member of Alarm Phone.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous: EU states have known about this for 58 hours and have failed to intervene. We have no idea where the other three boats are, whether the people might have been rescued or whether they drowned. </p> <p>\u201cSome sources say there may have been one shipwreck but it\u2019s difficult to match boats that have capsized as there is no evidence and they simply disappear. There is also no evidence because states refrain from sharing information, and so we have asked Italy, Malta, Libya and the EU to provide information.\u201d</p> <p>The boats are said to have been in distress in waters between Malta and Italy. On Saturday, the Maltese government banned rescue ships from bringing migrants to Malta.</p> <p>The decision came a few days after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/italy-declares-own-ports-unsafe-to-stop-migrants-disembarking\">Italian government declared its own ports \u201cunsafe\u201d</a> as the country struggles to contain the coronavirus pandemic. Libya, where thousands of migrants are kept in detention camps, also closed its ports in March.</p> <p>But migrants are still attempting journeys from Libya. On Sunday, Italy\u2019s transport ministry ordered those onboard the Alan Kurdi, a ship run by the German NGO Sea-Eye, to be moved to another vessel and tested and quarantined rather than be permitted to disembark.</p> <p>In a letter addressed to the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, on Sunday, the 23 Italian MPs and three MEPs, wrote: \u201cWe implore you to act quickly to help those who need to be rescued at sea. We hear news of a shipwreck, of boats laden with humanity, desperately trying to reach the European coast. We ask the Italian government to intervene before it is too late.\u201d</p> <p>Gregorio De Falco, one of the senators who signed the letter, said: \u201cThis is the time of year when migrant arrivals increase as the sea is usually calmer. In addition, there have been bombings in Libya very close to the coast where migrants are kept in detention centres \u2026 and so this pushes them to try and leave.\u201d</p> <p>In Italy\u2019s unprecedented decree last week, the government said it would block the arrival of migrant rescue ships until the end of the coronavirus emergency. The decree was signed by the interior minister, Luciana Lamorgese; the health minister, Roberto Speranza; the foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio; and the infrastructure minister, Paola De Micheli.</p> <p>\u201cThis decree is really ignominious,\u201d De Falco added. \u201cCoronavirus is being used as an excuse to say that Italy, and its people, would not be safe for shipwrecks or for migrants in general.\u201d</p> <p>The EU has been criticised for failing to act. The Italian unit of Sea-Watch, the German NGO, tweeted on Sunday: \u201cLeft to die alone on the day of Easter by a Europe that speaks emptily of solidarity towards people who suffer.\u201d</p>",

  "<p><em>You can take our freedom. But you can\u2019t take our grainy old football videos. In this short series I will be exploring the contents of Fifa\u2019s newly</em><em> released World Cup archive; re</em><em>visiting World Cup lore and World Cup truisms, and finding out if staring at them in peeled-eyeball detail from the confinement sofa really does reveal their deeper truths.</em></p> <h2><strong>No 1: USA </strong><strong>94 quarter-final, Dallas, 9 July 1994</strong></h2> <p>It might seem odd in the current digital age, when everyone knows everything about everyone, but as recently as the mid-1990s European football could feel like another place entirely. There was still an otherness about those diffuse sporting cultures, something seen only in glimpses and at intervals.</p> <p>The Dutch in particular were different. England had failed to make it out of the same group in qualifying for USA 94. There were elements of luck in the Netherlands\u2019 decisive victory in Rotterdam. But under Graham Taylor England had played a kind of extreme isolationist football, driven still by the island-nation game of the 1950s.</p> <p>The Dutch didn\u2019t just have better tactics or better players. There was something brittle and individualistic about their style, their way of carrying themselves. This was football of the left bank, the unfiltered cigarette, the gap-year poncho. It might not have been enough to progress regularly through the late stages of knockout tournaments. It might have been expressed just as often in a Jan Wouters as a Dennis Bergkamp. </p> <p>It helped that the Dutch had produced a tide of brilliant club footballers. The 1988 European champions showcased the star generation of Ruud Gullit and Marco van Basten. Six years on Van Basten was injured and Gullit had been dropped by Dick Advocaat just before the tournament. But the Dutch were if anything a deeper, stronger group now.</p> <p>As ever there were stutters and false starts. The Netherlands struggled through the group stage in America. Then they beat Ireland 2-0 in Orlando in the last 16. They came to Dallas to face Brazil with both teams in a position of strength. The winners of this quarter-final would face either Sweden or Romania in the semi, with the prospect of Germany, Bulgaria or a fretful-looking Italy in the final.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjV65U0zqNE\">And so we cut to Fifa\u2019s match-day film</a>, as the teams walk out in lovely soft powder blue mid-afternoon light at the Cotton Bowl. This is an odd-looking sprawl of a stadium with huge square tiers rising up from the central stands, the whole thing crammed at kick off with basking orange and yellow.</p> <p>Brazil come out holding hands in single file like a troupe of baby elephants heading off to the water hole, another indication of the strange combination of soppiness and ankle-hacking professionalism in those 1990s Brazil teams.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e56f27352078876402792ca9f718330f7547792\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e56f27352078876402792ca9f718330f7547792/0_0_4096_2731/1000..jpg\" alt=\"The Brazil and Netherlands teams take to the pitch for their quarter-final match at the  1994 World Cup at the Cotton Bowl, Dallas\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The teams take to the pitch at the Cotton Bowl.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neal Simpson/EMPICS Sport</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Netherlands are in white shirts and orange shorts, a look that has something slightly pub change-strip about it, as though they\u2019ve just turned their tops inside out. But the combination with Brazil\u2019s royal blue is still dazzling, the staging, the colours, the light entirely of their own time and place.</p> <p>The revved-up synth-pop USA 94 anthem dies away. Looking down the lines it is noticeable how clean-cut the Dutch seem. Ed de Goey is the only really grizzled face on show, but then the goalkeeper always looked as though he\u2019d just come shambling on to the pitch from his Amsterdam bordello, cigarette in mouth, cat under one arm, dressing gown flapping.</p> <p>The Dutch start quickly, weaving the ball through midfield, keeping possession. With three minutes gone Mazinho is fouled by Ronald Koeman. Branco shoots at goal from 40 yards (the Fifa commentator is amusingly unimpressed). Bergkamp is hacked down by M\u00e1rcio Santos. And from there the tone is set for a tough, impossibly tight first half.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/08/my-favourite-game-italy-v-brazil-1982-world-cup\">My favourite game: Italy v Brazil, 1982 World Cup second group stage</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Brazil had dropped their captain and most creative midfielder Rai at the start of the tournament. By the time they got to Dallas M\u00e1rio Zagallo had carved them into a brilliantly functional team, a group of mobile, tenacious footballers from mid-ranking club teams \u2013 Dunga is at Stuttgart, Mauro Silva is at Valencia \u2013 topped with the outright star wattage of Rom\u00e1rio and the guile of Bebeto.</p> <p>The Netherlands are much more fluent, keeping the ball easily in every part of the pitch, rotating positions in midfield, and moving with a kind of upright, easy arrogance. It is a familiar look. Of the 14 players Advocaat will use in these finals only De Goey and Stan Valckx are not products of the Ajax system. It felt at the time as though the Netherlands were on the right side of history with this.</p> <p>The Ajax way had been aggressively revived in European club football, sped by the change in rules to make the game more technical and less physical; by the emergence of a generation of post-Rinus Michels coaches; and by relaxed European labour laws that allowed Dutch footballers to infiltrate elite clubs in every league. From 1992 to 1996 Ajax or the Ajax-influenced Barcelona reached the European Cup and Champions League final four times. USA 94 fell right in the middle.</p> <p>In Dallas Aron Winter, Marc Overmars and Wim Jonk take turns in the playmaker role. Jan Wouters sits a little deeper, the same Wouters who broke Paul Gascoigne\u2019s cheekbone at Wembley. And this Dutch team is notably physical, pressing together in small swarms, constantly seeking collisions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5cc7387fb150bb2f55a7ddb3e17dd186afef6455\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5cc7387fb150bb2f55a7ddb3e17dd186afef6455/0_0_2047_1435/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Brazil\u2019s Bebeto is tackled by Frank Rijkaard during the first half.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"701\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brazil\u2019s Bebeto is tackled by Frank Rijkaard during the first half.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Allsport/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is the most notable element of double-take looking back. The Netherlands-Brazil 94 is a thrillingly tight, brutally disciplined version of football, a first half as aggressively compressed as the game can have ever been.</p> <p>There is a tendency to imagine only progress in modern sport, to see superior athletes and data-driven tactical nous year on year. But these two teams can cover and track and press with startling efficiency. The modern game looks defensively slapdash, even a little carefree by comparison.</p> <p>For a while the Netherlands switch possession from flank to flank, and it\u2019s like watching a Pep Guardiola team, with Marc Overmars ducking inside, Peter van Vossen staying wide, and little overloads bubbling up. Brazil are unfazed. The blue shirts run and hustle like maniacs, filling every space and covering every run.</p> <p>Van Vossen is punched and kicked to the ground by Aldair. Jorginho goes right through his ankles and you hear the scream. Wouters versus Dunga is like a middleweight title fight in central midfield. Rom\u00e1rio gets his first little wriggle into space. Towards half-time Bergkamp takes a high ball on his big toe, sways inside Mazinho, a ghost suddenly, then shoots into the side netting. \u201cIt certainly hasn\u2019t exploded into life yet,\u201d the commentator says as the whistle blows for the break. No shit. But it is still gripping, tightly knitted stuff.</p> <p>The mistake the Dutch make is to let their levels drop just a little at the start of the second half, to wait to see where the game will go. Because suddenly things start to happen.</p> <p>Bebeto is dropping deeper to turn with the ball, full-backs pushing on ahead of him. And Brazil\u2019s aggression creates the space for the opening goal as the Netherlands look to break quickly behind them, but only give the ball straight to Marcio Santos. He hits an instant long diagonal pass out to Bebeto on the right and suddenly the white shirts have vacated the centre.</p> <p>Bebeto runs on and and curls a low cross into the area. From there Rom\u00e1rio\u2019s finish is one-touch poetry. He hasn\u2019t had a shot at goal at this stage. Another player might have snatched at it, or become tense. This is Rom\u00e1rio though, who doesn\u2019t really do tense.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29ad425ea12416488b0a4f0fbf5fedcb29285512\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29ad425ea12416488b0a4f0fbf5fedcb29285512/0_0_1782_1287/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Rom\u00e1rio celebrates after opening the scoring\" width=\"1000\" height=\"722\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rom\u00e1rio celebrates after opening the scoring.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beate Mueller/Bongarts/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Instead he lets the ball run across him, then nudges it in a kind of pirouette-step off the outside of his foot and into the corner, producing in the middle of all this noise something startlingly inventive, an afterthought, a piece of fun, an improvised dance step.</p> <p>At 1-0 down the Netherlands send on Bryan Roy for Van Vossen. But they still look frantic. Frank Rijkaard takes a heavy touch, loses the ball and just sits down looking depressed. Someone has to lead here. A team response is required.</p> <p>But it is all Brazil for a while. Bebeto hits the outside of the post. De Goey runs off his line to block with his chest from Rom\u00e1rio. Brazil don\u2019t look like a great team in these moments. But they look ruthless, razor-edged and totally clear in what they\u2019re doing.</p> <p>Finally something strange happens, although just as striking now is how utterly confusing it is for the Dutch defence. The ball is headed high over the halfway line. Rom\u00e1rio simply walks back under its arc from an offside position, as players do regularly now. At which point three Dutch players stop moving, baffled by this witchcraft.</p> <p>Bebeto is away. One touch takes him around the keeper and two more put the ball in the empty net. The Brazil players go to the touchline and do the baby-rocking celebrations so many will later copy. The Fifa commentator muses ruefully on \u201cthe new offside rules \u2026 another sign of how little the players understand it\u201d. He\u2019s right. The Dutch, for all their modernity, were lost there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54e166851f4c50d799f28ee4cabaf0c529af38d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54e166851f4c50d799f28ee4cabaf0c529af38d2/0_0_4208_2841/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Mazinho (left), Bebeto (centre) and Rom\u00e1rio celebrate Bebeto\u2019s goal with their now famous baby-rocking celebration.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"675\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mazinho (left), Bebeto (centre) and Rom\u00e1rio celebrate Bebeto\u2019s goal with their now famous baby-rocking celebration.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Leech/Offside/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A minute later they\u2019re back in it. Bergkamp strolls through on the left hand side of the area, all upright, easy elegance. He opens his hips a little and side-foots the ball across Cl\u00e1udio Taffarel into the net.</p> <p>Now the Dutch click, playing better than either team at any stage, playing champion football, finding their most regal pass and move rhythms. Ronald Koeman is bossing the game, stepping out and screaming at his teammates. Bergkamp drops deep, spinning in that easy way, a kind of two-footed ice-dance turn.</p> <p>He sets up Winter for a shot, then hares off to the left and forces a corner. Overmars takes it. Winter runs across the six-yard box and heads the ball past Taffarel with thrilling power, the net billowing in cinematic fashion. It\u2019s 2-2 from 2-0 down. The Netherlands are playing through a period of grace. We\u2019ve got 14 minutes to go and this is surely heading only one way.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e3ee592bbbea55ffaafb3a10d98269303a8a8a70\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3ee592bbbea55ffaafb3a10d98269303a8a8a70/0_0_2891_1734/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Aron Winter heads home the Netherlands\u2019 equaliser.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aron Winter heads home the Netherlands\u2019 equaliser.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Action Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Except, once again, something else happens. Branco picks up the ball on the left, sees nothing ahead of him, hands off Overmars, and makes just enough ground before he\u2019s tripped by Jonk and then kicked on the ground by Koeman.</p> <p>\u201cA questionable free-kick,\u201d says the commentator but it\u2019s exactly what Branco wanted. He steps back 15 paces, like a gymnast preparing to vault the horse, runs straight at the ball and punts it with the top of his foot, sending it veering and swerving and bouncing into the corner of De Goey\u2019s net, the ball seized in that moment with a weird kind of voodoo.</p> <p>Branco just keeps on running, pointing at someone on the Brazil bench. From a position of ascent the Dutch are losing again, and they just can\u2019t gather themselves from here. All that craft, all that fine, imperious possession football \u2013 and they\u2019ve never actually been in front in the game. It suddenly feels like the acme of the Netherlands in the 1990s, ultimate expression of a certain kind of high-end brittleness.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO4bcOnnJnA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LO4bcOnnJnA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Highlights</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Branco is subbed off towards the end and actually goes around shaking hands with the opposition to waste more time. The Dutch look furious, but also lost. Five minutes of added time don\u2019t bring a single shot at goal. At the final whistle the blue-shirted bench is up leaping and dancing on the pitch, carrying out flags, the young Ronaldo there looking fresh and peppy and goofy.</p> <p>Brazil were a little lucky to win at the Cotton Bowl. At the same time they carried a cutting edge that was just too much for the Netherlands. Perhaps the Dutch would also have gone on to win this World Cup from here. It was arguably their best chance.</p> <p>The team of 1998 was even more talented, with Jaap Stam, Edgar Davids and Clarence Seedorf, as well as Patrick Kluivert up front with Bergkamp. But the rest of the field was stronger by then too. Euro 96 had taken a chunk out of the Dutch. Somehow those later teams lacked the meanness, the winning qualities of Rijkaard, Gullit and Koeman. The narrative arc seemed set, the notion of beautiful, brittle failure already written.</p> <p>Brazil would win two out of three tournaments, winning in 1994 and in 2002 and reaching the 1998 final in between, vindication of their own golden crop. A more prosaic Netherlands team would reach the final 16 years later. Louis van Gaal, the dead hand of mid-90s Ajax-ism, would take them to the semis 20 years on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"02c6ba2b2168967a54ac29ff61bea3782a37ab2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02c6ba2b2168967a54ac29ff61bea3782a37ab2c/0_0_2820_1894/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Dennis Bergkamp walks dejectedly off the pitch at the end of the match\" width=\"1000\" height=\"672\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A dejected Dennis Bergkamp trudges off the pitch after the Netherlands\u2019 defeat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bob Thomas Sports Photography via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Was all this obvious in Dallas?

Versions of how we want to see it are picked out from a row of disconnected points. A move the other way, a free-kick not given, a save not made, and the conclusions would no doubt be different. All the Fifa archive really tells us is that those endlessly revolving variables fall a certain way and we find a story to fit. One thing is certain though. It is still a very good one.</p>",

  "<p>Fears of coronavirus-induced shortages have sparked a desire to grow our own food, but getting hold of supplies isn\u2019t easy when popping to the garden centre is out of the question. Here\u2019s how to overcome some of the common obstacles to harvesting your first crop.</p> <h2><strong>You haven\u2019t got a clue</strong></h2> <p>Being on hand at home to care for your plants\u2019 needs means you will quickly learn what makes them thrive. But you must set out with the right mindset. Treat everything you grow as an experiment: if you manage a small harvest, that\u2019s a perk rather than the goal.</p> <p>Don\u2019t assume that you can plant seeds of 20 different veg now, and within a month be able to spurn supermarket produce. Although a few crops can be ready in just a few weeks, such as radishes and salad leaves, most take months to reach maturity, and even the most seasoned gardeners experience failures because of pests (slugs: I mean you), late frosts that kill fruit-tree blossom or a bad batch of seed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52ba60414cf61519dccb32094cb8204bd1e032f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52ba60414cf61519dccb32094cb8204bd1e032f9/543_1_4396_2639/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chillies need to be sown now.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chillies need to be sown now.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: dla4/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s the process of growing that is your reward: you\u2019ll soon become addicted to the thrill of spying your very first flash of green leaf against compost as your seeds sprout. If there are children in your household, get them involved. They are much more likely to eat something they helped to cultivate, and every aspect of growing involves some kind of home-schooling activity, from counting out seeds and writing labels for younger children to learning about photosynthesis and transpiration for older ones.</p> <p>Reach back in your mind to school biology lessons, and you will remember that all plants have the same basic needs: water and nutrients for the roots, and light, air and warmth for the leaves. Beyond that, every vegetable has its own ideal growing conditions. Some \u2013 such as tomatoes, chillies, courgettes and aubergines \u2013 need a long season to mature, so these need to be sown now if you want any chance of a crop. Others, such as lettuce, mature more quickly and can be sown in small amounts throughout the growing season.</p> <p>The internet is awash with advice, a great deal of it misleading \u2013 so ignore those viral videos about sowing herbs in glass jars; it won\u2019t work. However, you can\u2019t go far wrong starting with <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/,\">the Royal Horticultural Society website</a>, while the <a href=\"https://www.gardenorganic.org.uk/growing-advice\">charity Garden Organic </a>has plenty of guides to growing organically. </p> <h2><strong>You haven\u2019t got any seeds</strong></h2> <p>If the panic-buying run on vegetable seeds has left your local shops lacking, and you can\u2019t face yet another online order, have a rummage. If you locate some packets, unopened or opened, at the back of a drawer, it\u2019s worth sowing them, as many seeds remain viable long after the \u201cbest before\u201d date.</p> <p>Even if you draw a blank on that, your kitchen is full of other possibilities: there\u2019s no harm in sowing seeds plucked from the inside of a pepper or strained from the pulp of a tomato, although the results may be less predictable than those from a packet. If you have whole seeds of coriander, dill, fennel or fenugreek, you can sprout them as microgreens (see \u201cNo outdoor space\u201d, below). You can also regrow the bases of celery, onions and lettuce by placing them in a shallow dish of water. And you can raise pea shoots from dried peas. Growers are discouraged from planting sprouted spuds from the veg rack \u2013 certified disease-free seed potatoes specially produced for the grow-your-own market are safer \u2013 but many people report great harvests from discarded potatoes. For more ideas, get hold of the book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/No-Waste-Kitchen-Gardening-Regrow-Leftover/dp/0760361606\">No-Waste Kitchen Gardening by Katie Elzer-Peters</a>.</p> <p>If you have your own outside space, there may be things already thriving there that you can eat: some plants maligned as weeds are useful edibles, while there are ornamentals that are tasty, too. The young, tender leaves of the lime tree (<em>Tilia</em>) and the ice plant (<em>Hylotelephium spectabile</em>) can both be used in salads. But for safety\u2019s sake, make sure no one has been spraying weedkiller around, stick to your own space and remember many plants are highly toxic, such as giant hogweed and foxglove.</p> <p>Start with plants you can identify without a shadow of doubt, such as dandelions and nettles, and expand your knowledge using the <a href=\"https://pfaf.org/\">Plants for a Future</a> website or Adele Nozedar\u2019s book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Garden-Forager-Edible-Delights-your/dp/0224098896\">The Garden Forager</a>. Stick a bucket over a patch of dandelions and within a few days you will have blanched bitter leaves with many uses in the kitchen, from salads and sauteed greens to soups and pasta dishes. Soaking greens in a large bowl of heavily salted water then rinsing thoroughly removes dirt and unwanted hitchhikers, such as aphids.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1def6ba0f5278a278abe2be5a2f4fddc45f3d0e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1def6ba0f5278a278abe2be5a2f4fddc45f3d0e/307_578_4527_2716/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Plant up bare patches in the flowerbeds with kale.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Plant up bare patches in the flowerbeds with kale.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><br>You haven\u2019t got any soil</strong></h2> <p>Like seeds, compost is harder to source right now. Many of the DIY sheds are offering click-and-collect services for compost, however, while some garden centres will deliver to your door; Dalefoot and Fertile Fibre, two high quality peat-free compost brands, offer a mail-order service. If none of these is an option for you, all is not lost.</p> <p>If you have some lawn, cut away the turf using a spade (stack it into black plastic sacks and it will rot down into crumbly soil in about a year) and prepare a veg bed. Those with compost heaps already on the go are at an advantage, as good compost takes a few months to make: scrape off the top layer of uncomposted material, and you may find treasure below \u2013 it\u2019s ready when the worms have moved on to leave black, crumbly compost the consistency of a wrung-out sponge behind. Homemade compost isn\u2019t suitable for seed sowing, but you can add it as a layer of mulch to the top of veg beds and pots or dig it into the soil to add vital nutrients and organic matter.</p> <p>If you have flowerbeds with perennials, plant up bare patches with perennial vegetables such as welsh onions, rhubarb, perennial kale and sorrel, as well as perennial herbs, such as rosemary, chives, sage and thyme. You can also sow nasturtium seeds direct \u2013 the leaves and flowers are edible \u2013 or, beyond the end of May, when all danger of frost is past, plant out tender veg, such as tomatoes and courgettes. Just make sure you provide these hungry plants with extra nutrients through a liquid or granular feed.</p> <p>Tempting though it may be, don\u2019t fill pots with garden soil, as it\u2019s almost always too heavy to drain properly, and may well be full of eggs of slugs and other pests. Pots containing compost used for growing in previous years can be reused: tip it out and remove any weeds and any white C-shaped grubs, which are the larvae of the vine weevil. Add slow-release fertiliser such as <a href=\"https://www.organiccatalogue.com/products/seaweed-meal_mh6782\">Chase Seaweed Meal</a> and your revived compost is ready to go.</p> <p>If you have regular compost, but no seed compost, run what you have through an old sieve to remove the lumpy bits \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter for larger seeds, such as courgettes and beans.</p> <h2><strong>You haven\u2019t got a garden</strong></h2> <p>A balcony, a set of steps, a tiny patio or a couple of window boxes will still serve as growing spaces: just scale your range of crops accordingly. Watch where the sun rises to work out the aspect of your patch, as this will dictate what you can grow. South-facing sunny spots are ideal for growing most things, particularly tomatoes, herbs, chillies and french beans, while shady north-facing patches offer more limited options, including salad leaves, swiss chard, mint, sorrel and coriander. Don\u2019t forget to grow upwards: any vertical can be covered with trellis or wires to act as climbing frames for beans, peas, climbing squash or nasturtiums.

Your main limitation is lack of light: scope out your sunniest windowsill and requisition it for growing. If you are an impatient type, sprouting seeds and microgreens are your answer: you can sprout dried lentils, chickpeas and many other pulses and seeds by soaking them overnight then placing in a glass jar with a piece of fine muslin secured across the opening so that you can regularly rinse them with water as they grow, but a <a href=\"https://www.realfoods.co.uk/product/1397/bean-and-seed-sprouter\">tray sprouter will allow you to up production</a>. Microgreens take sprouting one step further, allowing seeds such as mustard, coriander and fenugreek to grow to 3-5cm tall before they are snipped. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Speedy-Vegetable-Garden-Mark-Diacono/dp/1604693266\">Speedy Vegetable Garden</a> by Mark Diacono and Lia Leendertz explains both techniques in detail.</p> <h2><strong>You haven\u2019t got any pots</strong></h2> <p>Fashion containers out of whatever you have to hand: an old kitchen bin or builder\u2019s bucket makes a great container for potatoes or a single tomato or chilli plant. You\u2019ll need to add drainage holes to the bottom of any container, so that excess water can run out \u2013 without that, plants\u2019 roots will rot. Remember that plants in containers will need regular feeding and daily watering in hot weather.</p> <p>On a smaller scale, plastic food trays for fruit and meat \u2013 and yoghurt pots of all sizes \u2013 are perfect for growing microgreens and starting off vegetable seeds. </p>",

  "<p>Over the past 27 years, my mum has been by my side through thick and thin. She is my best friend, my inspiration and my rock.</p> <p>I live with my husband, but my pre-Covid-19 days were regularly filled with quality mother-daughter time. We would travel to work together, grab a bite to eat in between meetings, and every Tuesday night, we\u2019d go ice skating together at Alexandra Palace, in north London, sharing a passion she passed down to me. But most importantly, my mum has accompanied me on my anxiety journey.</p> <p>For the past eight years, I\u2019ve suffered with general anxiety disorder, which although controllable with certain techniques, has meant panic attacks, irrational fears and a lot of crying in my mum\u2019s arms. But knowing that she has been present through my challenges and self-help discoveries has always filled me with calm.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/10/lift-lockdown-uk-east-asia-coronavirus-pandemic\">When lockdown started</a>, my heart sank: I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to see her. Suddenly, instead of our uplifting face-to-face conversations, I found myself offloading my coronavirus anxiety, intense claustrophobia and sleep deprivation on to her via FaceTime.</p> <p>Last week, having significantly more time on my hands than usual, I decided to sort out my perfume cupboard, reordering my bottles into fragrance families \u2013 the florals I would one day wear to summer events, the aquatic beach scents I would sport on future holidays and, last, my everyday picks. I enjoyed spraying these and escaping lockdown life, if only for a few hours.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f1b829e897c2111468bda19cd4c7bb5c8eb9cf5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f1b829e897c2111468bda19cd4c7bb5c8eb9cf5/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lauren and her mother\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Spraying the perfume on to my wrist, I immediately felt my mother\u2019s presence\u2019 ... Lauren and her mother</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Grace Pham/Image provided by Lauren Carbran</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite being a fragrance fanatic, I have not been spritzing my signature scents much during lockdown. Maybe because I\u2019ve not felt myself lately or perhaps it\u2019s just not felt appropriate to spray perfume each morning: it feels like the equivalent of wearing a full face of makeup to a sombre event.</p> <p>As I scanned the fragrances I once obsessed over, I felt empty and disoriented. Then, reaching for the back of the cupboard, I picked out a bottle I had never opened.</p> <p>It was my mother\u2019s perfume, L\u2019Occitane N\u00e9roli &amp; Orchid\u00e9e Eau de Toilette, in its elegant bottle complete with a pink bow. I remembered she had picked it up for me and shamefully I had never used it.</p> <p>Sitting on the floor and spraying it on to my wrist, I immediately felt my mother\u2019s presence. Memories came flooding back of baking cookies in the kitchen, walks in flower gardens and ice-skating together on a lake in Austria.</p> <p>It\u2019s known that fragrance has a unique ability to uplift and encourage happiness as our brain associates certain smells with positive associations and emotions, but I was stunned to feel the warmth and comfort of my mum\u2019s embrace after just one spritz.</p> <p>Since then, I have been wearing her fragrance every day, topping up every few hours and inhaling deeply. In lockdown, fragrance has become less of a luxury product and more of a therapeutic go-to that feeds my soul. It\u2019s an invisible connection to her in a bottle.</p> <p>Not only has this new perfume routine worked for me, but it\u2019s also put me in a more positive space to start and finish the day.

  "<p>From antibacterial brass doorknobs to broad, well-ventilated boulevards, our cities and buildings have always been shaped by disease.

After being cooped up indoors for months, might we all take a renewed interest in the value of parks and urban green space, as well as the public infrastructure of toilets, drinking fountains and, crucially, hand-washing facilities?</p> <p>Much 19th-century public health theory may have been misguided, based on the evils of imaginary fumes, but it had beneficial outcomes nonetheless. Since the times of ancient Greece, it was widely thought that disease emanated from the earth and was spread through noxious vapours, or miasmas, that came from the soil.</p> <p>\u201cMiasma theory had a huge influence on cities, specifically building materials,\u201d says Christos Lynteris, a medical anthropologist at the University of St Andrews and co-author of <a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/Plague-and-the-City-1st-Edition/Engelmann-Henderson-Lynteris/p/book/9781138326125\">Plague and the City</a>. \u201cThe craze for paving streets with flagstones was largely driven by sanitarian logic and a desire to seal in the earth\u2019s poisonous gases.\u201d</p> <p>It was thought that disease could permeate through any structure in direct contact with the earth, so walls were sealed at the surface and buildings were increasingly coated, clad, plastered and varnished, forming an impregnable shield against this invisible enemy. Cracks were great causes of alarm \u2013 not only did they suggest structural fatigue, but also the possibility that deadly fumes might be released.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34b1356bcf874a58cf2fba17dd24726aeaf6f2db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34b1356bcf874a58cf2fba17dd24726aeaf6f2db/0_129_1783_1070/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Drastic measures \u2026 the botched attempt to burn Honolulu\u2019s stricken Chinatown in 1900.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Drastic measures \u2026 the botched attempt to burn Honolulu\u2019s stricken Chinatown in 1900.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FLHC 26/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lynteris\u2019s study of the third plague pandemic \u2013 outbreaks of which recurred around the world for several decades, killing more than 12 million people in all \u2013 reveals how the disease spawned drastic urban measures. \u201cBurning down parts of the city was one of the most popular solutions,\u201d he says, citing one extreme attempt in Honolulu in 1900. The plan was to raze an infected part of the city\u2019s Chinatown (a plan imbued with racial overtones), <a href=\"https://slate.com/human-interest/2014/08/history-of-the-cordon-sanitaire-honolulu-hawaii-bubonic-plague-in-1899.html\">but the fire ended up destroying most of the city</a> when the wind changed direction.</p> <p>Other countries experimented with burning down urban blocks to create <em>cordons sanitaires</em>, but once the rat was identified as the main carrier, all attention turned to safeguarding buildings against rodents. \u201cEvery city in the world suddenly had committees of engineers trying to devise ways of rat-proofing,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a global craze, spawning thousands of patents in the 1910s and 20s, from drainpipe guards to concrete barriers.\u201d</p> <p>Lynteris is sceptical about how much coronavirus will actually change anything. \u201cEpidemics and pandemics have their own temporality,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are very condensed times, then panic dissipates very quickly and people rarely follow up.\u201d He points to the 2003 Sars outbreak, when it was discovered that one residential block in Hong Kong became a site of \u201csuper-spreading\u201d because of the way <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC539564/\">contaminated droplets from sewage pipes could enter people\u2019s bathrooms through dried-up U-bends in the drains</a>. Afterwards, there was no overhaul or mass-inspection of plumbing and ventilation systems to stop this happening again. \u201cA one-off pandemic usually has no impact at all,\u201d says Lynteris. \u201cIt has to keep coming back for us to take any notice.\u201d</p> <p>Some are using the current crisis to take a step back and reassess fundamental assumptions about how cities are structured. \u201cThis is the best time ever to think of a walkable city,\u201d says Wouter Vanstiphout, professor of design as politics at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. \u201cCould coronavirus be a catalyst for decentralisation? We have these enormous hospitals and people living on top of each other, but still having to travel long distances across the city to get to them. The pandemic suggests we should distribute smaller units such as hospitals and schools across more of the urban tissue and strengthen local centres.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f134749fa678e8b96c0d4a7c7cc1e92067e563c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f134749fa678e8b96c0d4a7c7cc1e92067e563c/0_800_4123_2474/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Personal space \u2026 open-plan offices may become a thing of the past.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Personal space \u2026 open-plan offices may become a thing of the past.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lester Lefkowitz/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With travel limited, the local high street has come into its own: corner shops and bodegas are generally proving much better stocked than supermarkets. The pandemic has also made visible other changes that have been happening under our noses. Vanstiphout says his friends who live in central Amsterdam have had a rude awakening. \u201cNow that tourism has stopped and the Airbnbs are empty,\u201d he says, \u201cthey have discovered they have no neighbours. There is no neighbourhood. There is no city. If you subtract the tourists, there is nothing.\u201d</p> <p>Coronavirus has exposed the effects of tourism and migration on cities across the world in different ways. In Delhi, the decree to stay at home has seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/india-wracked-by-greatest-exodus-since-partition-due-to-coronavirus\">thousands of migrant workers walk hundreds of miles back to their rural villages</a>, with cancelled work leaving them unable to pay rent.</p> <p>\u201cI think that \u2018global cities\u2019 boosterism will take some blows,\u201d says Vanstiphout. \u201cMuch has been made of this fluid network of metropolitan areas, but there is now more of a sense of the city as a place of safety, a place of home and continuity. This whole thing could be taken as warning against migration, but to me it\u2019s the opposite. It\u2019s a warning against tourism and the inequality that causes labour migration on a temporary basis; a warning against the gig economy and the devastation of public services. There is something really clarifying about a pandemic: you can see the absolute necessity of a public health service and a proper social welfare system. It creates a very clear picture of what is good.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Last week, I spoke to Anna Rogers, a Polish-born Londoner who lives in Brixton. She works for a charity called <a href=\"https://www.moneyaande.co.uk/\">Money A+E</a>, which operates across the south of the capital. It offers advice about debt, benefits and other financial issues to people who are often facing extreme hardship. It is a small set-up, with only four dedicated advisers. Since the coronavirus crisis began, the number of people getting in touch has tripled and is rising all the time.</p> \n<p>Rogers spoke matter-of-factly about the defining feature of many who now need her help. \u201cThey are people without any income,\u201d she said. Many are migrant workers who have been sacked by small businesses or had cash-in-hand work \u2013 in, say, the building trade \u2013 suddenly withdrawn. In desperation, some say they would like to return to their countries of origin to be with their families, but that option is cut off right now.</p> \n<p>A lot of them have no experience of the British benefits system, and few of the language skills and insider knowledge needed to navigate it. \u201cThe universal credit system never worked terribly well,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cBut now people are saying that the system crashes, or they can\u2019t upload documents.\u201d Not everyone has internet access, and the sudden closure of public libraries has meant that even fewer people can get online. Even if they manage to do so, there is now an ominous sense that with the system under such pressure, the standard <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/almost-500000-people-in-uk-apply-for-universal-credit-in-nine-days\">five-week wait</a> for universal credit is bound to increase.</p> \n<p>So, for now, Rogers and her colleagues have to introduce people to the most basic kinds of help. One fairly reliable source of food assistance, she said, was the array of new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/16/community-aid-groups-set-up-across-uk-amid-coronavirus-crisis\">mutual aid groups</a> that have sprung up at the most local level: \u201cFingers crossed, they can get people some food parcels.\u201d When she spoke about the details of her work, her words had a palpable sense not just of sadness, but of urgency and a clear sense that things were only going to get worse, and quickly.</p> \n<p>The fact that we now rarely leave our homes means few people are aware of what is actually going on all over the country. Our field of vision is replete with statistics, and broad-brush warnings about the near future: from the daily death toll to the warnings from big banks of <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-08/world-economy-faces-5-trillion-hit-that-is-like-losing-japan\">$5.5 trillion</a> in lost global output, to the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-08/world-economy-faces-5-trillion-hit-that-is-like-losing-japan\">million</a> or so people said to have newly applied for benefits in the UK. A very human crisis caused by Covid-19 is already here, beyond the illness itself, and it demands our attention.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a01c98ee-1da8-4dbb-b816-af3dabe22d9b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6j_jHXV8LMs?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>To a large extent, it is the result of what many of our politicians have been extolling for years: labour market \u201cflexibility\u201d; a benefits system designed to deter people from using it; and a public sector so underfunded that charities have had to step into the breach. Now, even last-ditch safety nets are fraying fast. The day after my conversation with Rogers, I spoke to Robin Burgess at the <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/anglia/2020-04-09/hope-is-fragile-demand-is-great-the-challenge-for-charities-during-the-pandemic/\">Northampton Hope Centre</a>, a project that runs one of the comparatively rare food banks that deals not only with \u201cambient\u201d items (cans, pasta and other dried goods) but also fresh food. We had briefly spoken a few days before, when he sent me an image of a box of doughnuts covered in mould, sent by one of the big supermarkets \u2013 a particularly vivid example, he said, of how low his organisation\u2019s supplies were running, and how useless some of the \u201chelp\u201d they received sometimes proved to be.</p> \n<p>Donations from the public, Burgess explained, had largely dried up. A lot of fresh food used to come from cafes and restaurants, but they were now shuttered up. Aside from Morrisons, the big supermarkets tended to only directly donate food that was either past or very close to its sell by date, and often of poor nutritional value. And need was inexorably increasing. \u201cWe\u2019ve got about two weeks of supplies, or more like 10 days,\u201d he said. \u201cThen we\u2019ll have nothing left.\u201d To some extent, he said, what he was facing reflected the growing crisis for charities and voluntary organisations \u2013 who, over the next 12 weeks, are reckoned to face a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/08/rishi-sunak-heeds-calls-to-help-charities-with-750m-extra-funding\">shortfall of \u00a33.7bn</a>. Last Wednesday, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, gave them only \u00a3750m. And all the time, the social wounds they somehow have to put plasters over are only increasing.</p> \n<p>When people draw cliched analogies between the Covid-19 crisis and the second world war, they seem to forget some very obvious things. That conflict was characterised by mass mobilisation. Anyone who could work simply had to: the great upsurge in production that necessarily underpins all-out war demanded it. The coronavirus crisis brings the polar opposite: a new world of confinement, silence, closures, lay-offs and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/08/fraudsters-likely-to-target-furlough-scheme-says-hmrc-chief\">furloughing</a>\u201d.</p> \n<p>If you are able to work from home, relatively free of anxiety about your job and so far untouched by either illness or death, isolation might come with compensations: you may, indeed, be living the Sunday-supplement lockdown dream of craft projects with the kids and demolishing your backlog of novels. But that is the experience of a tiny minority, even if it is informing some of the media\u2019s apparent neglect of what so-called lockdown actually means for millions of people.</p> \n<p>Not everyone who instinctively wants the lockdown to be eased as soon as possible is guilty of putting profit before life. It is surely not irresponsible to wonder whether the suspension of everyday existence is not already proving unsustainable, and whether there might come a point when the risks of the virus are outweighed by damage to people\u2019s lives that may prove irreparable. As deaths here and abroad continue to increase, any honest view of our current circumstances must surely be ambivalent \u2013 acknowledging that lockdown is necessary, and it is a miracle that the health service has not already buckled, but also that it is exacting a toll that for many people is already unbearable.</p> \n<p>That applies not just to those who are falling between the cracks, but to many others who will soon be receiving significant help from the government. Ten days ago, for example, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jStGMYRSXO0\">I spoke</a> to a single mother who works for McDonald\u2019s, is paid \u00a39.45 an hour, and has been furloughed. Even if Sunak\u2019s job retention scheme ensures that she receives 80% of her average wages over the previous year, the loss of a fifth of her money will have dire consequences.</p> \n<p>She budgets penny by penny and lives month to month. She is already faced with deciding between cooking or heating. Her 13-year-old son has asthma; if the radiators are not switched on in cold or wet weather it gets worse. She spoke with a fierce clarity, and a keen awareness of something she knew far too well: that she is one small part of a social catastrophe so far given far too little attention.</p> \n<p>\u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Before each game in Germany, Sasaki would play the grainy footage to his players; a reminder that their efforts had significance beyond the borders of the sport.</p> <p>Japan had never made it out of a group stage before and nobody expected them to do it now. They\u2019d stumbled into 2011 after a poor showing in the Asian Cup, but two wins against New Zealand and Mexico put them on course for their first quarter-final. Their luck seemed to run out when they were drawn against the hosts.</p> <p>But there was a sense of destiny, almost a cosmic apology, to that game. After a tense 90 minutes, it was Karina Maruyama \u2013 one of two players who had worked at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant before the meltdown \u2013 who scored the winner. A semi-final against 2003 runners-up Sweden was next and, again, Japan progressed thanks to a Sweden own goal and two Hedvig Lindahl errors.

She wore the armband at the age of 32, and in a foreshadowing of Megan Rapinoe in 2019, went on to win the Golden Boot and the Golden Ball. Like Rapinoe, it had as much to do with what was happening off the field as what was happening on it.</p> <p>The final in Frankfurt was where it all crystallised. The USA were powerhouses of the women\u2019s game and many thought they\u2019d sail to the title. But as goalkeeper Hope Solo said afterwards: \u201cI truly believe that something bigger was pulling for [Japan].\u201d The Americans charged out from the opening whistle: Lauren Cheney\u2019s strike was swept aside within 30 seconds. Heather O\u2019Reilly wreaked havoc down the right, Rapinoe down the left. Abby Wambach hit the crossbar. But Japan stood firm, a break-wall against those thunderous waves.</p> <p>It took a young Alex Morgan to open the scoring: a galloping counter in behind. But another moment of fortune drew Japan level, a panicked clearance finding Aya Miyama in the six-yard box instead to make it 1-1.</p> <p>Momentum was in Japan\u2019s favour as extra-time began. Just before the interval, the USA took the lead. Morgan danced to the by-line and fizzed a cross into Wambach. Header. Goal. Exhaustion. Elation. And a likely game-winner.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=Sport&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=My%20Favourite%20Game&amp;description=In%20our%20new%20series%2C%20Guardian%20writers%20recall%20the%20great%20sporting%20contests%20they%20will%20never%20forget&amp;read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsport%2Fseries%2Fmy-favourite-game&amp;links=false\" data-alt=\"My favourite game\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=Sport&opinion-tint=false&title=My%20Favourite%20Game&description=In%20our%20new%20series%2C%20Guardian%20writers%20recall%20the%20great%20sporting%20contests%20they%20will%20never%20forget&read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsport%2Fseries%2Fmy-favourite-game&links=false\">My favourite game</a> </figure>  <p>But Japan, whose resilience was forged in something greater than football, fought on. And with six minutes left, Homare Sawa scored <em>that goal</em>. Against this force of nature that was the US women\u2019s national team, the 5ft 5in midfielder struck, redirecting a corner kick with a flick of her heel. It was miraculous. It was sublime. My awe then was not like Kant\u2019s, though: it wasn\u2019t directed at the wave, but rather towards the woman who never gave up in the face of it.</p> <p>The US would lose the resulting shootout 3-1, bringing the World Cup to Asia for the first time. And Japan\u2019s women\u2019s team became to their devastated nation what Sawa became to me: a symbol of perseverance and heart \u2013 a triumph of hope against all the odds.</p>",

years sub-Saharan Africa is about to go into recession, according to World Bank estimates.</p> <p>Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s two biggest economies, South Africa and Nigeria are heading for deep recessions, it said, as demand drops from developed nations for raw materials such as oil and precious metals.</p> <p>The same goes for Angola, Africa\u2019s second biggest oil exporter.</p> <p>Oil prices have fallen to between $20 and $30 a barrel, nearing the cost of production in Nigeria.</p> <p>Following 2.4% growth last year, the estimate for sub-Saharan Africa 2020 is between -2.1 and -5.1 % as the economy contracts.</p> <p>This is in part a knock-on effect from the economic hits being taken by Africa\u2019s main trading partners: China, the EU and the United States.</p> <p>Add to that the slump in the key markets of raw materials and tourism as well as the effect of measures to confine populations at home and you have the perfect economic storm for the continent.</p> <p>The African Development Bank remains less pessimistic but still sees a fall into recession of between -0.7 and -2.8 %.</p> <p>The African Union estimates that around 20m jobs, in formal and informal sectors, are under threat.<br></p> <p>The United Nations puts the figure much higher, at up to 50m.</p> <p>High unemployment and economic slowdown are also hitting African workers abroad, and therefore their money transfers back home, which are often a vital part of the economy.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e92b7668f08db3109f20f8a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p

British aid minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan said assisting the poorest nations now would help prevent the virus returning to the United Kingdom. </p> <p>Britain has reported almost 10,000 deaths from the coronavirus so far, the fifth highest national number globally. </p> <p>\u201cWhile our brilliant doctors and nurses fight coronavirus at home, we\u2019re deploying British expertise and funding
