class=\"block-title\">Lockdowns reduced infection rate by 81%, study finds</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Lockdowns had a dramatic impact on the spread of coronavirus in Europe with strict controls on people\u2019s movements preventing an estimated 3.1m deaths by the beginning of May, with 470,000 deaths averted in the UK alone, researchers say.</p> \n  <p>Outbreak modellers at Imperial College London said that lockdown slashed the average number of people that contagious individuals infected by 81% and lowered the reproduction number, R, of the epidemic below 1 in all countries they observed.</p> \n  <p>When R is less than 1 the epidemic is in decline because on average, each infected person transmits the infection to less than one other. As countries ease out of their lockdown, scientists are watching R closely: if it rises and remains above 1, the epidemic will grow exponentially. </p> \n  <p>The Imperial team pooled data on Covid-19 deaths from 11 European countries including the UK, Italy, France, Spain and Germany, and worked backwards to calculate the extent of transmission several weeks earlier, to account for the time lag between infections and deaths. Lockdown at the end of March reduced the reproductive number of the UK epidemic from 3.8 to 0.63, they calculate.</p> \n  <p>The model shows that by 4 May between 12 million and 15 million people had become infected, but some nations were hit far harder than others. According to the model Belgium had the largest number of cases per capita with 8% of the population infected, compared with only 0.46% of Norwegians and 0.85% of Germans. Some 5.1% of the UK population was infected, according to a report <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2405-7\">published in Nature</a>. </p> \n  <p>\u201cOur model estimates that we are very far away from herd immunity,\u201d said Axel Gandy, a professor of statistics at Imperial and co-author on the study. Herd immunity is achieved when enough people are immune to a virus that outbreaks die out naturally. In the case of Covid-19, scientists believe upwards of 70% of the population would need to be resistant for herd immunity to kick in. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIt tells us we need to be very careful and not to release too much in one go because then you have no control,\u201d Prof Gandy said. \u201cWe need to tread very carefully and do things slowly, so we can backtrack should they not work.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T15:11:40.880Z\">at 4.11pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ede31e98f083999a26dc398\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T12:53:36.098Z\">1.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Authorities in <strong>Pakistan</strong> have stepped up efforts to enforce protocols after the number of coronavirus infections surpassed 100,000. </p> \n  <p>Official statistics released today showed 103,671 confirmed cases and 2,067 from Covid-19.

  "<p><strong>What&nbsp;was the situation like when the league was suspended on 13 March? </strong>James Milner\u2019s incredible goalline clearance at Anfield feels a lifetime ago but there were some green shoots despite a dispiriting defeat to Liverpool that in many ways was symptomatic of Bournemouth\u2019s season to date. Unsettled from the moment Steve Cook was forced off through injury, within 15 minutes Liverpool had turned the tables after seizing on sloppy mistakes. But Eddie Howe was understandably encouraged by the manner in which his side threatened, finding joy on the counterattack and they would have equalised through Ryan Fraser but for Milner\u2019s intervention.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/29/eddie-howe-bournemouth-manager-interview-piano\">Eddie Howe: \u2018I don\u2019t want to be told my team didn\u2019t play well by my piano teacher\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A week earlier, they had Chelsea on the ropes but failed to eke out victory. Bournemouth&nbsp;have never been so ensconced in a Premier League relegation battle with nine games to go and, as Howe knows, there is little margin for error when they return.</p> <p><strong>What about now? </strong>Finally, Bournemouth can unleash David Brooks after an injury-plagued 12 months for the winger who has twice undergone surgery because of an ankle complaint. Meanwhile Lloyd Kelly, an exciting \u00a313m arrival from Bristol City last summer, is primed for his first taste of Premier League action after being bogged down by ankle and thigh injuries. The treatment room is sparse compared to March, with Charlie Daniels, who is yet to return to training following knee surgery, set to be the only notable absentee when Crystal Palace visit next weekend. Howe feels this is the strongest squad he has assembled but, until now, there has inevitably been frustration at not being able to fully utilise it. The run-in is tricky, with trips to Wolves, Manchester City and Manchester United but Bournemouth should return with more oomph.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Fiver\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What needs to be done to have a successful end to the season? </strong>Getting a significant tune out of Ryan Fraser would be a major boon given he confessed to being sidetracked by transfer speculation for the first few months of the campaign.&nbsp;\u201cI wasn\u2019t myself, I didn\u2019t play for the team. I\u2019m honest enough to admit that,\u201d he told the BBC in January.&nbsp;No Bournemouth player has made more top-flight appearances than the winger this season but his influence has undoubtedly waned. Fraser is set to depart on a free transfer this summer, seven years on from joining as a teenager from Aberdeen for \u00a3400,000, and one last hurrah would likely ensure a happy ending for all parties. Bournemouth yielded seven points from the last available nine at home and extending that form behind closed doors would be handy.</p> <p><strong>Have players and staff behaved during lockdown? </strong>There has been one blemish \u2013 Jordon Ibe\u2019s foolish decision to breach lockdown guidelines by inviting celebrity barber Nikky Okyere to cut his hair and then publicising his flouting of the rules on Instagram. He posted a since-deleted image of him wearing a mask and a gown that carried the stylist\u2019s rather apt slogan: \u201cBreaking The Rules &amp; Changing The Game\u201d. Bournemouth launched an investigation and Ibe released a grovelling apology.&nbsp;The 24-year-old, who arrived at Bournemouth from Liverpool in 2016 for a then club-record \u00a315m, has been training with the under-21s since December.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2f7a4233b54b53c0e972ae96d983941f98e488b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f7a4233b54b53c0e972ae96d983941f98e488b8/1227_0_1794_2111/850.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Smith has enjoyed being back in training.\" width=\"850\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adam Smith has enjoyed being back at training.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFC Bournemouth/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Any unsung/community heroes? </strong>Howe became the first Premier League manager to take a voluntary pay cut amid the coronavirus crisis, while the squad donated a six-figure sum to Bournemouth Churches Housing Association, which supports victims of domestic abuse. Several players and staff contacted vulnerable and isolated supporters. Adam Smith, who was born in east London, donated 10 iPads to Princess Alexandra hospital in Harlow to enable Covid-19 patients to communicate with their families via FaceTime. The club is also considering bearing a message to key workers on their shirts for the remainder of the season after ending its sponsorship deal with betting company M88.</p> <p><strong>Key player in the run-in? </strong>Jefferson Lerma \u2013 the lungs of the team. The combative midfielder is walking a disciplinary tightrope given he is a yellow card away from a two-match suspension, but Bournemouth need him to make his presence felt. His reputation as the team\u2019s bouncer sometimes precedes him but there is more to Lerma than firefighting and putting his head in where it hurts.</p> <p><strong>End-of-season-prediction</strong>

  "<p>Well silly old me. Having listened in on more of the Downing Street daily coronavirus briefings than I care to remember, I could have sworn that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/07/what-is-coronavirus-r-number-and-is-it-rising-in-uk\"> the R value</a> \u2013 which measures how many people a Covid patient goes on to infect&nbsp;\u2013 was a vital factor in any plans for easing lockdown. I distinctly recall only last month \u2013 and the month before that \u2013 Matt Hancock, Boris Johnson and other government ministers saying that R was stuck at between 0.7 and 0.9 and was far too close to 1 to allow any relaxation of the guidelines. Other than for Dominic Cummings who was free to do exactly as he liked.</p> \n<p>How things change now that the government has eased some lockdown restrictions and is hellbent on easing a whole lot more as soon as possible, having begun to concentrate as much on the long-term economic implications of the pandemic as on the nation\u2019s health. Not that the health secretary was keen to frame the argument in those terms when Labour brought him to the Commons to answer an urgent question on R and the government\u2019s handling of the crisis. Rather he was at pains to hide behind the science that it is increasingly obvious he doesn\u2019t understand any better than most of the rest of us.</p> \n<p>As so often these days, Matt\u2019s natural enthusiasm couldn\u2019t quite paper over a general sense of fatigue and tetchiness. More and more he is reverting to type: a junior account executive at a large firm of management consultants who tries to conceal his ignorance in jargon \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve been very front foot,\u201d he said in irritation at one point \u2013 and gets easily narked when people pick holes in his ideas. Today he sounded like someone who had spent the entire weekend trying to come to grips with a stack of academic papers but had struggled to make head or tail of any of them.</p> \n<p>Matt began with his default mantra that he was proud of the government\u2019s record. A death rate of nearly 60,000, when the chief medical officer had said 20,000 would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/uk-can-keep-covid-19-deaths-below-20000-says-medical-director\">\u201ca good result</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/uk-can-keep-covid-19-deaths-below-20000-says-medical-director\">\u201d</a>, and a YouGov poll showing the UK joint bottom with Mexico in an international survey of approval ratings for its handling of the pandemic seem strange things of which to be proud, but he said the country had done the right thing at the right time. The rest of Europe must be mightily relieved that it had chosen to do the wrong thing at the wrong time instead and somehow avoided the UK\u2019s disastrous public health outcomes.</p> \n<p>Having got all that off his chest \u2013 it\u2019s become a kind of daily affirmation for him to remind himself that he could possibly have done worse \u2013 Hancock moved on to the more substantive detail. The number of new infections was going down, the coronavirus was in retreat and all that stuff he had said in the past about significantly bringing down R could now be ignored. All he had really meant was that as long as it stayed stable at just under 1, the government was free to relax its lockdown guidelines. At a stroke, R had just been reduced to near zero. At least in the level of importance to which the government attached to it.</p> \n<p>The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, was understandably sceptical. Hadn\u2019t Prof John Edmunds, one of the government\u2019s scientific advisers, only said at the weekend that the government had locked down too late and was taking a huge gamble on easing restrictions so soon? And hadn\u2019t the health secretary also once said that another key instrument in relaxing health guidelines was to get a proper track and trace system in place? Something the track and trace programme director had said wouldn\u2019t be ready for at least another three weeks.</p> \n<p>But Matt was adamant. He was being guided by the science. Because what he had learned from the whole pandemic was that if one scientist disagrees with you, it\u2019s fairly straightforward to find another who will support whatever you want to do. So even though some epidemiologists were reporting R was higher than 1 in parts of the UK, he had some others who said it wasn\u2019t. The time had come to take a punt on the nation\u2019s health and go with the most optimistic science. Something he was sure the brand new Joint Biosecurity Centre would agree on when it finally came into existence.</p> \n<p>Inevitably it wasn\u2019t long before Tory MP Harriett Baldwin brought up the Black Lives Matter protests. Shouldn\u2019t the protesters have made more effort to socially distance rather than get so up close and personal with one another? Matt nodded enthusiastically. If there was a spike in infections in two week\u2019s time then we would all know who to blame. At which point R will presumably be wheeled out of retirement and allowed to take centre stage once more.</p> \n<p>The protests were also the subject of a ministerial statement from Priti Patel. It\u2019s always a hard sell saying the government finds racism abhorrent when the prime minister once made a good living out of dashing off Daily Telegraph columns about picaninnies with watermelon smiles and women in burkas resembling letter boxes, but the home secretary did her best to gloss over the hypocrisy. She then \u2013 through gritted teeth \u2013 defended people\u2019s right to protest before condemning violence against the police and criminal damage.</p> \n<p>There were no arguments from Labour on any of these last points. Violence and tearing down statues had no place in our society. And yet you couldn\u2019t miss the faint whiff of hypocrisy on both sides of the house. Almost all those who were appalled by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/blm-protesters-topple-statue-of-bristol-slave-trader-edward-colston\">Edward Colston being dumped in the river </a>had cheered when the statue of Saddam Hussein had been torn down.</p> \n<p>Nor was anyone calling for Colston to be reinstated on its plinth. Quite the reverse in fact, as many people in Bristol and elsewhere were rethinking the importance of figures with a murky colonial past in their cities. It was almost as if the protesters had done everyone a favour. They had got rid of a statue no one wanted and allowed the politicians to sound high-minded about the way in which it had been done. In Westminster they call that a win-win.</p>",

As countries ease out of their lockdown, scientists are watching R closely: if it rises and remains above 1, the epidemic will grow exponentially. <br></p> \n  <p>The Imperial team pooled data on Covid-19 deaths from 11 European countries including the <strong>UK, Italy, France, Spain and Germany</strong>, and worked backwards to calculate the extent of transmission several weeks earlier, to account for the time lag between infections and deaths. Lockdown at the end of March reduced the reproductive number of the UK epidemic from 3.8 to 0.63, they calculate.<br></p> \n  <p>The model shows that by 4 May between 12 million and 15 million people had become infected, but some nations were hit far harder than others. According to the model Belgium had the largest number of cases per capita with 8% of the population infected, compared with only 0.46% of Norwegians and 0.85% of Germans.

  "<p>The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, sparked unease among some on the left of his party on Monday, as he condemned as \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/blm-protesters-topple-statue-of-bristol-slave-trader-edward-colston\">tearing down</a> of the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol at the weekend.</p> \n<p>Starmer and the shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said they shared the sense of injustice that had brought more than 100,000 people out on to the streets of the UK to join Black Lives Matter protests in recent days.</p> \n<p>But in a clear shift in tone from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s attitude to civil disobedience, Starmer told LBC radio: \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have been done in that way, [it was] completely wrong to pull a statue down like that.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/who-was-edward-colston-and-why-was-his-bristol-statue-toppled-slave-trader-black-lives-matter-protests\">Who was Edward Colston and why was his Bristol statue toppled?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>He added: \u201cStepping back, that statue should have been taken down a long, long time ago. We can\u2019t, in 21st century Britain, have a slaver on a statue. A statue is there to honour people.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat statue should have been brought down properly, with consent, and put, I would say, in a museum.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some leftwing Labour MPs privately expressed concern at what they felt was an unfortunate departure from Corbyn\u2019s approach.</p> \n<p>Speaking in the House of Commons later in the day, Thomas-Symonds used a similar phrase to Starmer, saying, \u201cI do not condone an act of criminal damage to remove it, but I will not miss a public statue of a slave trader.\u201d</p> \n<p>Thomas-Symonds was responding to the home secretary, Priti Patel, who insisted: \u201cBlack Lives Matter, but police brutality in the US is no excuse for the violence against our brave police officers at home. So to the quiet, law-abiding majority, who are appalled by this violence, and have continued to act within the rules, I hear you.\u201d</p> \n<p>The shadow home secretary made a series of demands of the government, including calling for Patel to act on the recommendations of the Wendy Williams review into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\">Windrush</a> scandal, and the 2017<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/08/david-lammy-review-bame-children-face-prejudice-flawed-criminal-justice-system\"> David Lammy review</a> into the experience of BAME people in the justice system.</p> \n<p>But his measured tone contrasted with passionate interventions from prominent leftwing Labour MPs, including Lloyd Russell-Moyle, Nadia Whittome and Zarah Sultana.</p> \n<p>Whittome had earlier tweeted, \u201cI celebrate these acts of resistance. We need a movement that will tear down systemic racism and the slave owner statues that symbolise it. And we need to win a government that will always be on the side of this movement.\u201d</p> \n<p>Thomas-Symonds\u2019 predecessor, Diane Abbott, also sounded a note of caution about Labour\u2019s approach. \u201cNobody supports criminal damage. But we need to be careful not to sound as if we care more about the vandalism than the horrors of the Atlantic slave trade,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe truth is that the community in Bristol tried for years to even get a plaque on the statue that mentioned slavery. They were blocked. The statue should have been taken down years ago. There is an excellent <a href=\"https://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/international-slavery-museum#section--about\">museum of </a><a href=\"https://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/international-slavery-museum#section--about\">slavery</a> in Liverpool. That would be the right place for this statue, if it is eventually fished out of the water.\u201d</p> \n<p>One Tory, representing a former \u201cred wall\u201d Labour seat said Starmer had a significant amount of work to do to eradicate the perception that Labour was soft on law and order. They said: \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing my voters can\u2019t stand, it\u2019s rioting. To them, it\u2019s an anathema to the democratic process.\u201d They said their inbox was full of messages, including from ex-Labour voters, on the protests over the weekend. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want soft-touch policing.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ben Bradley, the MP for Mansfield, which turned Tory after 100 years in 2017, said: \u201c99% of my feedback from constituents is horror at the lack of law and order and at the lack of care for others by those breaking lockdown. Many have said they were sympathetic but not now, following the violence.\u201d</p> \n<p>A group of seven \u201cblue collar\u201d Tory MPs also posed for pictures as they offered help to clean up the statue in Parliament Square of Winston Churchill, which had \u201cis a racist\u201d spray painted on it during the protest.</p> \n<p>One Labour MP in a red wall seat said: \u201cThese are the sorts of things that do test the fragility of the voter coalition that used to be very successful for us. Where we see divisions on issues like Brexit, law and order, immigration and so on \u2013 these do become our test points. I thought Keir navigated that very well.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>For Jagun Akinshegun, the toppling of a 17th-century slave trader\u2019s statue was a moment of catharsis, making it easier to let go of the past. For his daughter Robishia Temple, it was a sign that it could be possible to imagine a more hopeful future.</p> <p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t represent Bristol,\u201d said Temple, who is a learning and development adviser. \u201cNow he\u2019s at the bottom of the river. That says a lot more about who we are.\u201d</p> <p>When Akinshegun, 59, and Temple, 26, joined thousands of others on the Black Lives Matter protest in their home city on Sunday to express their anger at the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> in the US, they had no inkling of what was in store.&nbsp;</p> <p>They were close to the statue of Edward Colston \u2013 erected by the city in the 19th century to mark his philanthropy, and a longstanding source of dismay to Bristol\u2019s black community because of his undisputed role in the enslavement of around 84,000 people \u2013 when something momentous started to happen.</p> <p>\u201cMy first initial thing was to duck, to keep quiet,\u201d said Akinshegun, a building surveyor, in Temple\u2019s back garden the following day.

The organisers of the main protest have distanced themselves from the toppling of the statue and its unceremonious dumping in Bristol Harbour. Police did not intervene at the time but have since <a href=\"https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/police-identify-17-suspects-responsible-4203875\">identified 17 suspects</a>. Boris Johnson and Priti Patel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/08/uk-coronavirus-johnson-says-anti-racist-protests-were-subverted-by-thuggery-live-news-covid19-updates?page=with:block-5edddbd48f08bd75dbb63dc0\">condemned</a> the demolition, as did the local council\u2019s Conservative group leader, Mark Weston, who called it \u201ca wanton act\u201d. Bristol\u2019s mayor, Marvin Rees, the son of a Jamaican migrant, said that although the statue had been an \u201caffront\u201d throughout his life, he could not \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/06/08/world/europe/ap-eu-protests-britain-slavery.html?searchResultPosition=8\">condone criminal damage</a>\u201d.</p> <p>But at the time, several of those present told the Guardian, the mood was not vandalistic but righteous. After all, more formal attempts to bring about the figure\u2019s removal had become so bogged down that even an attempt to affix a new plaque to better reflect Colston\u2019s history had been delayed indefinitely.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWatching it come down was just \u2026 <em>release</em>,\u201d said Camerine Fearon, a bank worker. \u201cIt was getting rid of something that we\u2019ve needed to get rid of for years.

And then, suddenly, everyone united and started shouting \u2018tear it down\u2019. It didn\u2019t even take long. It was about four tugs of the ropes.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Briefly, and without planning it, Akinshegun found himself among those pulling. \u201cI was so happy to see it, and so happy to help,\u201d he said. Then he stood back and watched Colston fall.&nbsp;</p> <p>As Temple wept, her father ran forward in jubilation and leapt up and down next to Colston\u2019s toppled effigy. Soon afterwards he was among those pictured holding a knee on the sculpture\u2019s neck, a bitterly ironic repeat of the brutal hold that ended George Floyd\u2019s life.&nbsp;</p> <p>On Monday, as the harbourmaster checked that the sunken hunk of metal presented no risk to boats nearby, a small crowd gathered, gazing intently at the space where the statue had been. The base lay skewed on the ground, and passersby took turns to pose for selfies next to it.</p> <p>LaToyah McAllister-Jones, who had decided to stay away the previous day because of the mayor\u2019s warning about physical distancing, brought a sign chosen by her young son. \u201cSILENCE IS VIOLENCE,\u201d it read. \u201cThis has always been a divisive place,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted my son\u2019s words to be part of how that changed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"023e61933e02d1a1f03ea9e39767c750565a4bd8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/023e61933e02d1a1f03ea9e39767c750565a4bd8/0_1531_5246_3145/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simbarashe Tongogara\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simbarashe Tongogara.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nearby, Simbarashe Tongogara said he had stayed away on Sunday because he felt it was now incumbent on white people to take the lead in the fight against racism. \u201cBlack people have been marching for a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been in this city since 1967, and on my first day at school I was called Sambo.

They also said their ambulances would not take Covid patients so we would have to arrange our own ambulance.\u201d</p> <p>All private Delhi hospitals they called said they had no beds for coronavirus patients so the family took Narender in the privately-hired ambulance to a nearby government Rajiv Gandhi hospital, but they said they had no ICU beds for Covid patients. After another two hours, a government-run hospital agreed to admit him.</p> <p>\u201cBut there was no care for him, no attendants even came out and me and my sister had to carry my brother-in-law myself from the ambulance on to the stretcher and take him up two floors of the hospital with no help.

Despite the valiant and persistent efforts of campaigners, all attempts to have the statue peacefully removed were thwarted by Colston\u2019s legion of defenders. In 2019, attempts to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-47670756\">fix a plaque to the pedestal</a> collapsed after Bristol\u2019s Society of Merchant Venturers, the high priests of the Colston cult, insisted on <a href=\"https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/second-colston-statue-plaque-not-2682813\">watering down the text</a>, adding qualifications that, it was felt, had the effect of minimising his crimes. Yet what repulsed many about the statue was not that it valorised Colston but that it was silent about his victims, those whose lives were destroyed to build the fortune he lavished upon the city \u2026</p> \n   <p>Today is the first full day since 1895 on which the effigy of a mass murderer does not cast its shadow over Bristol\u2019s city centre. Those who lament the dawning of this day, and who are appalled by what happened on Sunday, need to ask themselves some difficult questions. Do they honestly believe that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/bristol\">Bristol</a> was a better place yesterday because the figure of a slave trader stood at its centre? Are they genuinely unable \u2013 even now \u2013 to understand why those descended from Colston\u2019s victims have always regarded his statue as an outrage and for decades pleaded for its removal? </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And here is the full article.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/edward-colston-statue-history-slave-trader-bristol-protest\">The toppling of Edward Colston's statue is not an attack on history.

He may be a disappointment to anyone yearning for some Corbynite passion and radicalism, but even supporters of Boris Johnson\u2019s government would have to admit that gravitas, experience and competence have not been its defining characteristics, and so Starmer has arguable spotted a gap in the market. In this, his first LBC phone-in, he was at it again \u2013 repeatedly stressing his desire for consensus and cooperation. He was strikingly non-partisan.</p> \n  <p>He also sounded very different from his predecessor. During the Labour leadership contest he mostly played down the obvious differences between his politics and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s. But the gap between them is considerable, as was well demonstrated by what Starmer said about the toppling of the Edward Colston statue in Bristol. It is hard to imagine Corbyn describing what happened as \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Starmer said that, although the statue of Edward Colston in Bristol should have been removed years go, the manner in which it was pulled down was \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d.</strong> Asked for his reaction to what happened yesterday, Starmer said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It shouldn\u2019t be done in that way. Completely wrong to pull a statue down like that.</p> \n   <p>But, stepping back, that statue should have been taken down a long, long time ago. You can\u2019t, in 21st-century Britain, have a slaver on a statue.</p> \n   <p>A statue is there to honour people. And you can\u2019t have that in 21st-century Britain. That statue should have been brought down properly with consent and put, I would say, in a museum.</p> \n   <p>This was a man who was responsible for 100,000 people being moved from Africa to the Caribbean as slaves, including women and children who were branded on their chests with the name of the company that he ran. Of the 100,000, 20,000 died en route and they were chucked in the sea. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He defended the decision of the police in Bristol not to intervene.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I was very struck by Superintendent Andy Bennett, who was the police officer, the superintendent, on the ground who judged the situation. And he said he was really disappointed by the vandalism and the bringing down of the statue. But he didn\u2019t think it was the right thing to intervene, because it might make the situation worse.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the Labour MP Barry Gardiner was wrong to attend a Black Lives Matter rally, in breach of social distancing guidelines.</strong> Asked about this, he said Gardiner was \u201cwrong to do it\u201d and that MPs had to lead by example.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Starmer suggested that the government\u2019s 14-day quarantine scheme for new arrivals at airports should be replaced with a testing system for people coming to the country.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the government\u2019s furlough system should be made more flexible, with increased support for workers in particular sectors.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said he considered \u201cthe leave/remain divide is over\u201d.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He refused to back calls for the post-Brexit transition to be extended.

  "<p>British nationals who have spent months apart from non-EU spouses have expressed fears that their separation will become permanent as mass unemployment and furloughing as a result of the Covid crisis could leave them ineligible for visas.</p> <p>Vicky Scarth, 40, moved back to the UK from Sri Lanka last October to find work in order to sponsor her husband of three years, Vikum, to settle in Edinburgh with her and her six-year-old son. She secured a job that met the minimum income requirement of \u00a318,600 per year, but she was dismissed in February owing to the coronavirus outbreak and has been unable to find paid work since.</p> <p>\u201cI find myself in an impossible situation: I lost my job and can\u2019t get another one at the moment, and I don\u2019t have any childcare provision. For the first time in my life, I\u2019m on the outside looking in, completely disenfranchised,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI feel so angry that the power to decide what is right for my family has been completely taken away from me. Just because I married a Sri Lankan, I\u2019m treated with disdain by my government. All we want is to be together \u2013 we have the right to a family life.\u201d</p> <p>Paul Goodwin married a Zambian woman, Anita, eight years ago and relocated to Derby last year to begin working as an operations manager. He has since been furloughed and is concerned he will be unable to meet the financial threshold to settle his wife in the UK.</p> <p>He said: \u201cPaying for two households, with four children and two adults, is always difficult, but now it feels like I\u2019ve got a mountain to climb before they can come over. We\u2019re not criminals, we just want to live together as a family.\u201d</p> <p>Last month in <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/Commons/2020-04-20/37494/\">response to a written parliamentary question</a> about whether the Home Office had considered suspending the minimum income requirement for visas during the coronavirus pandemic, the immigration minister Kevin Foster said there were \u201ca number of ways\u201d to meet the \u00a318,600 threshold. He suggested \u201cincome from the couple\u2019s investments, property rental or pension may also be taken into account, together with their cash savings.\u201d</p> <p>Caroline Coombs, from the campaign group <a href=\"https://www.reunitefamiliesuk.co.uk\">Reunite Families UK</a>, said these suggestions were \u201cabsurd\u201d.</p> <p>She said: \u201cIt\u2019s like battling Goliath, honestly. These are the spouses and children of British citizens. The trauma of forced separation, particularly during a global pandemic, is incredibly challenging \u2013 and what\u2019s worse is, this isn\u2019t going away after lockdown.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cPeople won\u2019t be able to get jobs, and for those who have managed to cling on to one, they\u2019re already working crazy hours to try to meet the requirements for their husband or wife to be with them. Even then, most people still can\u2019t raise the funds. The Home Office needs to bring in a blanket period of time to lower the income requirements, or get rid of them completely.\u201d</p> <p>Nineteen overseas visa application centres are due to reopen by the end of this week \u201cwhere local restrictions allow\u201d. But for spouses in countries where borders remain closed and flights grounded, the possibility of a reunion in the near future appears unlikely. </p> <p>Some couples say the lack of information has been a particular source of frustration. Owen Wibberley left South Korea in early March to begin a new job in Yorkshire, and applied for a spouse visa for his wife, Misun, to follow with their two young children, both dual British-Korean nationals. Misun\u2019s passport is currently being held at a closed visa application centre in Seoul.</p> <p>\u201cThe worst part is not knowing the result of the visa application,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have informed us that a decision has been made but not what the result is. If it has been rejected then we will have spent all this additional time separated for no reason. At least if they could tell us the result then we could make more concrete plans regarding housing and major purchases, but being in a total state of limbo is infuriating.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Colin Yeo, an immigration lawyer, said the government\u2019s limited communication on the issue since the lockdown started was unacceptable.</p> <p>\u201cThe deafening silence from the Home Office is causing huge anxiety for affected couples at what is already a really worrying time. Families need to know whether they are going to have to separate or whether new rules will be introduced enabling them to stay together. We\u2019ve seen all sorts of other non-urgent policy immigration announcements recently, so it is baffling that families are being ignored in this way.\u201d</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said it had taken a \u201ccompassionate and pragmatic approach\u201d to the spouse visa application process during the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cFamily immigration requirements are being kept under review, including the minimum income requirement, and we will publish further guidance shortly,\u201d they said. \u201cSome visa application centres overseas have reopened with social distancing in place, meaning that passports can be returned and people can now supply biometric information or supporting documents for their visas.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>You might think, given some of the responses, that the statue of slaver Edward Colston was one our best-loved national treasures. Priti Patel, the home secretary, called its toppling and dumping in Bristol harbour by Black Lives Matter protesters \u201cutterly disgraceful\u201d and \u201csheer vandalism\u201d. The policing minister Kit Malthouse chipped in that it was \u201cmob rule\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/blm-protesters-topple-statue-of-bristol-slave-trader-edward-colston\">BLM protesters topple statue of Bristol slave trader Edward Colston</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is one occasion when Boris Johnson might, instead of adding to the chorus, have wheeled out those classical allusions he\u2019s usually so free with \u2013 to educate his cabinet about basic cultural history. People have been toppling statues for as long as there have been effigies of the famous. The BLM iconoclasts were merely doing what was customary in ancient Rome. When Sejanus, cruel henchman of Emperor Tiberius, finally fell, so did his statues. The crowd attacked them as if beating up Sejanus himself. In Bristol, red paint to symbolise the blood of slaves was daubed on Colston\u2019s bronze body.</p> <p>More recently, the most explicit way for the peoples of eastern Europe to celebrate their liberation from communism in 1989 was by pulling down the statues of leaders that had loomed over them for so long. I don\u2019t remember any western politicians calling their actions \u201cdisgraceful\u201d or \u201cvandalism\u201d. It was instead acclaimed as the legitimate voice of the people finally taking down the lies of the Stalin era.&nbsp;</p> <p>As an art lover, I could wish that we saw statues in a purely aesthetic way \u2013 but we don\u2019t. We equate a statue with the person it represents and that\u2019s pretty much it. When a revolution overthrew Pope Julius II in 16th-century Bologna, the city\u2019s people celebrated by tearing down a colossus of the Pope, melting it, and using the bronze to make a huge cannon. It cut no ice that it happened to be a masterpiece by Michelangelo.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f01d64a786666d48f910bf6a74a7a2d0d57fa7ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f01d64a786666d48f910bf6a74a7a2d0d57fa7ca/0_0_5936_3562/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Black Lives Matter protesters transporting the statue, daubed in red to signify blood, towards the Avon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Black Lives Matter protesters transporting the statue, daubed in red to signify blood, towards the Avon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Had Bristol\u2019s statue of Colston been a work by some west country Michelangelo, there would obviously be more to debate. But it was just one of Britain\u2019s legion of strange, unmemorable old statues put up in the Victorian age. Designed by one John Cassidy and erected in 1895, it typifies the artistically unimaginative genre of statuary favoured in Britain in the age of empire.&nbsp;</p> <p>If it wasn\u2019t for the protests against it in recent years, the boring old figure of Colston would have been noticed by no one. It would have continued to fade into the fabric of our cities just as statues of Queen Victoria or Kitchener do. We don\u2019t really notice these statues \u2013 until someone gets angry at them. This oddly brings them to life. Who took any notice of Oxford University\u2019s statue of arch-imperialist Cecil Rhodes before the Rhodes Must Fall campaign?&nbsp;</p> <p>It\u2019s absurd to pretend Colston or Rhodes are much-loved heritage heroes or that their statues are major works of art. Colston\u2019s record as a slave trader is&nbsp;established historical fact. Saying he was also a benefactor of Bristol is a bit like saying a serial killer was nice to his mum. </p> <p>At the heart of this is a long-running problem: Britain has never truly faced its slave-trading past. Bristol and Liverpool both mushroomed as cities on the flayed backs of slaves. The commercial boom that made Britain rich in the 18th century was fuelled by slavery and the Caribbean sugar plantations that relied on it. Bristol has fine Georgian houses whose every brick can be read as a monument to the slave trade.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"897815de6868acf2ad01f79ddc0be8b84c68341d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/897815de6868acf2ad01f79ddc0be8b84c68341d/0_0_3263_2273/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pivotal moment \u2026 diagram of Liverpool slave ship the Brookes, 1788.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"697\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pivotal moment \u2026 diagram of Liverpool slave ship the Brookes, 1788.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What\u2019s not fair is to say slavery, or the sins of empire, make Britain inherently evil. That\u2019s because we also have a history of conscience and protest. Anti-slavery campaigners stood up against this inhumanity in the 18th century. It was British abolitionists in the 1780s who published the infamous diagram of the Liverpool slave ship, the Brookes, revealing the way living people were crammed in. William Blake protested against enslavement in his prophecies; William Wordsworth wrote eloquently in support of the Haitian rebel leader, Toussaint L\u2019Ouverture; and Mary and Percy Shelley boycotted sugar. Britain has plenty of heritage to be proud of \u2013 and the BLM protesters have just joined it.&nbsp;</p> <p>There is one argument made against removing statues that seems sound, at least on the surface. It is that we need more memory, not less. By erasing Colston\u2019s statue, it might be claimed, you simply remove an image that made people think about a history we really should never forget.&nbsp;But it\u2019s a fantasy to say we all go around contemplating the rights and wrongs of our past through the medium of Victorian statues. Yes, the history of slavery and empire should be central to our sense of Britain\u2019s past. But we need to find new ways of understanding the transatlantic trade in humans. Why not start by replacing Colston\u2019s statue with a big bold artwork that recreates the cargo deck of the Brookes?</p>",

  "<p>\u201cTo be neutral, to be passive in a situation,\u201d the historian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jan/28/howard-zinn-america\">Howard Zinn</a> tells us, \u201cis to collaborate with whatever is going on.\u201d If the history of black political struggle in the US \u2013 something Zinn, a white ex-soldier, actively participated in \u2013 teaches us one thing, it is that meaningful political&nbsp;change happens not just when black and brown people take a stand against racism, but when the wider society moves from being neutral to becoming actively anti-racist.&nbsp;</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/apr/14/student-nonviolent-coordinating-committee\">Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee</a> (SNCC) was one of the most formidable organisations in the fight for civil rights. It understood that change occurs when people are moved to action. Students in northern US universities, although sympathetic to the plight of black southerners, remained passive supporters, so the SNCC organised \u201cfreedom buses\u201d for students to come and act as observers.&nbsp;</p> <p>These students witnessed lynchings, attack dogs mauling protesters and fire hoses dislocating bones, and they transformed into active anti-racists. Enraged by what they had witnessed, these students wrote home to their parents, often passive opponents of the \u201criotous\u201d civil rights protesters. On hearing of the injustices first-hand and in their children\u2019s voices, many thousands became aligned to the cause, and the entire political climate shifted in relation to the demands of southern freedom movements.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the wake of the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>, we have statements of solidarity from politicians, corporations and even <a href=\"https://news.npcc.police.uk/releases/uk-police-stand-with-those-appalled-by-george-floyd-death\">police forces</a>, but these are mere gestures. To be anti-racist means to involve yourself directly in the movement to end racism, to take action. The first step toward becoming an anti-racist is reckoning with the fact that racism is systemic. As the scholar and activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/angela-davis\">Angela Davis</a> remarks: \u201cThere is an unbroken line of police violence in the US that takes us all the way back to the days of slavery.\u201d Race, as the Australian scholar Patrick Wolfe put it, is a \u201ctrace of history\u201d, a tradition travelling through several hundred years and in part facilitating the birthing of the global north and global south.</p> <p>The categorisations of race facilitated colonial conquests, enslavement and exploitative labour regimes \u2013 all engines of capitalism. Today, the political-economic setup of the global economy rests on the availability of a cheap, informal labour force, imperialist warfare, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/22/this-changes-everything-review-naomi-klein-john-gray\">extractivism</a>, the mass incarceration of racialised people and mind-blowing inequalities in educational attainment, wages, housing and healthcare. This deep entanglement of accumulation, dispossession and violence is what is meant by the term \u201cracial capitalism\u201d. For example, in 2016 the Byron burger chain was happily employing migrant staff, some of whom worked 50 hours a week on minimum wage, until it facilitated a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/28/it-was-a-fake-meeting-byron-hamburgers-staff-on-immigration-raid\">Home Office raid</a> to have them deported. Staff reported that Byron entrapped them in a fake-meeting-cum-sting-operation. Racism and capitalism are inseparable.</p> <p>For these reasons, nearly all anti-racist mass movements worth their salt have recited tirelessly: ending racism, root and branch, would mean ending a global economic order predicated upon it. Anti-racism is anti-capitalist, and vice versa. There are no two ways around it. To be an anti-racist must demand a complete rejection of business as usual. An end to racism demands transformation of the global political-economic setup. This would mean paying workers fair wages across supply chains and ending the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/dec/27/uk-black-and-ethnic-minorities-lose-32bn-a-year-in-pay-gap\">ethnicity pay gap</a>, which flies in the face of the primary corporate objective of profit.</p> <p>So how can you go from being a passive non-racist to an active anti-racist? Anti-racism is the fight to build a mass-participating anti-racist movement in the workplace, the street and the community. Beyond a protest, a donation, a social media post and a difficult conversation, there\u2019s work to be done in tackling the many day-to-day issues underscored by racism. Learning is an essential part of this journey, so make a reading/listening/watching list and include the autobiography of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/13/assata-shakur-civil-rights-activist-fbi-most-wanted\">Assata Shakur</a>, of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/07/malcolm-x-man-behind-myth\">Malcolm X</a>, of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/08/from-emperors-to-inventors-the-unsung-heroes-to-celebrate-in-black-history-month\">Claudia Jones</a>, of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/15/germans-take-to-the-streets-to-celebrate-rosa-luxemburg-karl-liebknecht-berlin\">Rosa Luxemburg</a>, of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/04/your-silence-will-not-protect-you-by-audre-lorder-review\">Audre Lorde</a>.

Material changes require us to make movements from moments: this is a huge political moment, now we must build a huge political movement. We must all become anti-racist activists, black, white, brown \u2013 all of us. As activists we need to work together, outside the state agencies, which are some of the principal purveyors of systemic racism, to meet the needs of black and brown communities in Britain.&nbsp;</p> <p>Black and brown people are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/black-people-four-times-more-likely-to-die-from-covid-19-ons-finds\">four times</a> more likely to die from coronavirus than white people. Being an anti-racist activist means first of all taking up the fight for improved healthcare provisions and protective work equipment in these communities. Black and brown people are massively overrepresented in coronavirus-related searches, arrests and fines. To be an anti-racist means to fight against the sweeping new range of policing powers being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/03/met-police-twice-as-likely-to-fine-black-people-over-lockdown-breaches-research\">used disproportionately</a> against working-class racialised communities.&nbsp;</p> <p>Criminalisation, gentrification, the \u201chostile environment\u201d, the closing of local public services: these are all arenas of anti-racist activism. So, find your local anti-racist organisation; if it doesn\u2019t exist then set it up. Every youth club, every school staying in the local authority, every saved estate, every anti-deportation and anti-raids group, every local police-monitoring group, will make concrete differences in improving the lives of racialised communities. When enough of these groups exist, are connected and can show solidarity with each other across cities and towns, then, and only then, will we begin to make inroads into tackling systemic racism.</p> <p><em>\u2022</em> Joshua Virasami is an organiser and artist whose book How To Change It is published on 3 September</p>",

Thank you, as always, to those who took the time to reach out on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan\">Twitter</a> and elsewhere. </p> \n  <p>Here are the key developments from the last few hours: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The Minneapolis city council pledged to defund city\u2019s police department. </strong>A veto-proof majority of the Minneapolis city council announced its intent to dismantle the city\u2019s police department and invest in community-led public safety, a move that would mark the first concrete victory in the mounting nationwide movement to defund law enforcement agencies in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd. My colleague Sam Levin explains <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/defunding-the-police-us-what-does-it-mean\">here</a> what defunding the police might mean. </li> \n   <li><strong>New York City\u2019s mayor pledged to cut police department funding. </strong>New York City mayor Bill de Blasio on Sunday pledged to cut the police department\u2019s funding, shifting the savings to social services. In a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nycgov/status/1269730600505794565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">tweet</a> from the City of New York shared by the mayor, de Blasio outlines policing reforms, including a plan to \u201cShift funding from NYPD to to Youth and Social Services.\u201d </li> \n   <li><strong>New York City\u2019s curfew was lifted. </strong>De Blasio also lifted a citywide 8pm <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/george-floyd-protests-curfew-rules-arrests\">curfew</a> that drew extensive criticism for intensifying tensions between protesters and police \u2013 including numerous accounts of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/new-york-police-brutality-protests-george-floyd\">brutality</a> against participants in demonstrations following the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd.</a> </li> \n   <li><strong>A protester was shot in Seattle. </strong>A man drove a car into a demonstration and shot a protester in Seattle, Washington.<strong> </strong>It\u2019s unclear exactly what happened, but police said officers have a man <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SeattlePD/status/1269836366109536262\">in custody</a> who drove a car into a crowd at 11th avenue and Pine street, and that officers recovered a gun. Video footage shows a man driving a black sedan into the gathering, and catches a loud bang before the man exits the vehicle, gun in hand. The man then walks into the crowd with the gun at his side.</li> \n   <li><strong>US attorney general said troops were a last resort. </strong>The US attorney general, William Barr, appeared on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, where he was asked about the decision to have military troops on standby to respond to US citizens exercising their right to protest. \u201cI think our position was common, which was that they should only be deployed ... as a last resort and that we didn\u2019t think we would need them. I think everyone was on the same page,\u201d he said. Reports emerged last week that Donald Trump wanted 10,000 active troops to be ordered on to the streets of America to police the protests. Barr denied that accusation on Sunday. \u201cThe president never asked or suggested that we needed to deploy regular troops at that point,\u201d he said.</li> \n   <li><strong>Thousands marched in Phoenix, Arizona,</strong> where protesters rally not just for George Floyd, but for Dion Johnson<strong>, </strong>a 28-year-old black man who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/may/29/george-floyd-killing-protests-minneapolis-minnesota-us-twitter-donald-trump-latest-news-live?page=with:block-5ed1ebe48f084df971c8c71b#block-5ed1ebe48f084df971c8c71b\">shot and killed </a>by an Arizona Department of Public Safety officer.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T07:07:42.569Z\">at 8.07am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5edde0218f0883ec2fc1cbb1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T06:55:45.212Z\">7.55am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">New York City Mayor pledges to cut police department funding</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Sunday pledged to cut the police department\u2019s funding, shifting it instead to social services. </p> \n  <p>In a tweet from the City of New York shared by the mayor, de Blasio outlines policing reforms, including a plan to \u201cShift funding from NYPD to to Youth and Social Services.\u201d </p> \n  <p>\u201cThe amount will be finalized with the city council during the budget process,\u201d the statement says:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/nycgov/status/1269730600505794565\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAKING: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYCMayor?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NYCMayor</a> announces new policing reforms in New York City: <a href=\"https://t.co/aWQgz0NBDK\">pic.twitter.com/aWQgz0NBDK</a></p>\u2014 City of New York (@nycgov) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nycgov/status/1269730600505794565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 7, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5edddd318f08bd75dbb63dca\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T06:40:20.014Z\">7.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As always, please do get in touch with questions, comments, news and tips from your part of the US on twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan\">@helenrsullivan</a> or via email: helen.sullivan@theguardian.com.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T06:41:33.047Z\">at 7.41am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5edddbfe8f083999a26dbfa5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T06:37:07.408Z\">7.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Meanwhile British Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted on Sunday that the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1269724206440370178?s=20\">anti-racism protests in the UK</a> were \u201csubverted by thuggery\u201d, after some protestors clashed with police in London: </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1269724206440370178\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">People have a right to protest peacefully &amp; while observing social distancing but they have no right to attack the police.

And not, unfortunately, exceptional elsewhere.</em></p> \n  <p><em>Tens of thousands gathered at the weekend in London, Manchester, Cardiff, Glasgow and other parts of the UK. In Bristol, protesters toppled a statue of slave trader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/27/bristol-city-slave-trader-edward-colston\">Edward Colston</a>. But the movement has also brought people on to the streets in Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires; in Abuja and Nairobi; in Barcelona, Copenhagen and Paris. These marches express solidarity and outrage that the richest and most powerful country in the world should continue to treat its people this way. Demonstrators oppose the racial legacy it embodies, and the brutal, militarised police response to protests.</em></p> \n  <p><em>But though they honour the African American experience, they also recognise the commonality of black struggles elsewhere, and more broadly the fight for human rights.

Wolf was asked the question on ABC\u2019s This Week on Sunday, by host Martha Raddatz, who pointed out <strong>African Americans are killed by police at twice the rate of white Americans</strong>.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI do not think that we have a systemic racism problem with law enforcement officers across this country,\u201d said Wolf. \u201cDo I acknowledge that there are <strong>some law enforcement officers that abuse their jobs?</strong> Yes. And again, we need to hold those accountable. And I would say that there are individuals in every profession across this country that probably abuse their authority and their power ... </p> \n  <p>\u201cI think painting law enforcement with a broad brush of systemic racism is really <strong>a disservice to the men and women who put on the badge</strong>, the uniform every day. Risk their lives every day to protect the American people, to protect them so that they can go to school. They can have a business and come home safe to their families. So I think we need to keep that in mind as well.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Florida congresswoman and former Orlando police chief, <strong>Val Demings</strong>, was also on the show and disagreed with Wolf\u2019s comments. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIf we\u2019re going to solve some of America\u2019s toughest problems, <strong>we\u2019ve got to be painfully honest about what those problems are</strong>,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we know that we have been fighting systemic racism in this country for 400 years. We know that it has found its \u2013 or reared its ugly head in law enforcement agencies, in housing, in education, in \u2013 in too many other places. And so while I heard what the secretary said, we have a lot of work to do. And systemic racism is always the ghost in the room.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Demings, who is a potential running mate for Joe Biden in November, spoke about <strong>her own experiences after a 27-year career as a police officer</strong> in Orlando.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI\u2019ve worked beside some of the bravest men and women with hearts big as gold that America has to offer,\u201d he said. \u201cWas everybody perfect? Were we completely perfect? Of course not. But what I have seen across the nation involving law enforcement officers and their reaction, in many instances unprovoked, has been extremely troubling. And what we have to do as a nation is hold police accountable, provide the necessary oversight to do that, look at training standards, look at use of force policies, look at who we are hiring, look at diversity within those agencies, and come together and create legislation that will support initiatives like that.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5edcf4d68f0883ec2fc1c60f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-07T14:22:29.485Z\">3.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Donald Trump has said the <strong>national guard are withdrawing from Washington DC</strong>. </p> \n  <p>\u201cI have just given an order for our National Guard to start the process of withdrawing from Washington, D.C., now that everything is under perfect control,\u201d wrote the president on Twitter. \u201cThey will be going home, but can quickly return, if needed.

  "<p>When the Neameh sailed out of Colombia on 4 May, it should have been a routine shipment: just over 4,000 cattle, on their way to Egypt, an important hub for the global trade in live animal exports.</p> <p>But accusations of cocaine smuggling and a police raid of the ship&nbsp;lengthened the journey.</p> <p>As the Neameh sailed into the mouth of the Mediterranean in the early hours of 21 May, it was apprehended close to Gibraltar by Spanish customs agents and the Spanish navy on suspicion of cocaine trafficking.</p> <p>Spain\u2019s health ministry did not allow any of the cattle to disembark, or the offloading any carcasses, while customs and police searching the ship were unable to use sniffer dogs because of the stench.

Many others were in agonising pain, with no remedy.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cIt was hell,\u201d one witness told Europa Sur, describing a scene of overcrowding and animals \u201cbarely able to stand on their feet\u201d. The Spanish interior ministry referred requests for comment to the police, who did not respond to questions about the operation or its outcome.&nbsp;</p> <p>The search was eventually called off and, without public explanation, the ship continued its journey the next morning. &nbsp;By the time the vessel docked in Damietta on Egypt\u2019s northern coast, according to the ship\u2019s records, 34 animals had died, although their bodies were not on the boat. </p> <p>Officials from the Egyptian agriculture ministry who inspected the vessel on arrival in Damietta on 29 May <a href=\"https://www.cairo24.com/2020/05/29/%D8%A8%D8%B9%D8%AF-%D9%86%D8%B4%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A9-24-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B2%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D9%8F%D8%B4%D9%83%D9%84-%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%86%D8%A9-%D9%84%D9%81/\">described</a> the animals as being in a \u201cmiserable condition\u201d.

Everyone has a right to investigate, but not to harm people. This was barbaric.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Some of the 42 crew members were forcibly sequestered in one part of the ship, he said, while others were taken to a nearby police station. While 20 were normally tasked with taking care of the livestock, just three or four labourers were permitted to care for the animals while the search took place.</p> <p> The ones chosen were apparently unfamiliar with what needed to be done to keep them safe and healthy. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t conduct proper feeding and watering,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cattle lay down, but normal practice is to get them up and then put out the feed so that no cattle jump on top of one another. When they do this with so few people these things happen. It\u2019s a big issue.\u201d The result, he claimed, was poor conditions on board.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/20/live-export-animals-at-risk-as-giant-global-industry-goes-unchecked\">Live export: animals at risk in giant global industry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Shawkat rejected any suggestions that lack of care for the animals prior to their unexpected arrival in Spain was responsible for the distressing conditions witnessed in Algeciras. Instead he blamed the unplanned stop for the problems. \u201cDuring the search they spoiled the feed,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a limited amount for the destination. But with these delays \u2026 it\u2019s hell what happened to the ship, it was in really bad shape. For animal welfare, it\u2019s a big violation.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>He also dismissed any possibility that the Neameh was smuggling cocaine, or that the poor conditions on board could have made it easier to hide a cache of drugs. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said. \u201cFor one reason, there was no one allowed to go on board [in Colombia] due to Covid-19, and no one allowed to leave the ship. It\u2019s out of the question.\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Multiple Colombian government agencies did not respond to requests for comment about the Neameh smuggling cocaine.&nbsp;</p> <p>The tale raises questions about links between the global narcotics trade and the animal industry. In Colombia in the 80s, for example, <a href=\"https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/146771NCJRS.pdf\">Pablo Escobar\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/146771NCJRS.pdf\">cartel</a> was reported to have strong links with the Colombian Cattlemen\u2019s Association.

Why, critically, was the ship allowed to leave Spain when conditions potentially breached EU <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2018/621853/EPRS_STU(2018)621853_EN.pdf\">regulation</a>s which say that animals being transported in or out of the EU must comply with animal welfare standards?</p> <p>\u201cThe Neameh only obtained attention by authorities and the media because of the suspicion of drug trafficking.

But when the entries for the Newmarket race were published last week, Terebellum was listed as owned by Godolphin.</p> \n<p>Asked to explain that, Godolphin\u2019s managing director, Hugh Anderson, replied: \u201cNo comment\u201d.

  "<p>In November 1966, the Gemini 12 spacecraft, carrying two astronauts, splashed down in the Pacific. The four-day mission was a triumph, proving that humans could work in outer space, and even step into the great unknown, albeit tethered to their spacecraft. It catapulted the US ahead of the USSR in the space race.</p> <p>From then, Nasa\u2019s goal was to beat the Russians to the moon. That meant weeks rather than days in space, in an isolated, claustrophobic environment. There was one perfect way to prepare humans for these conditions: going underwater. The world was gripped. If we could land people on the moon, why not colonise the ocean as well?</p> <p>Nasa scientists were not the first to dream of marine living. Evidence of submarines and diving bells can be found as far back as the 16th century. The literary grandfather of all things deep, Jules Verne, popularised the idea of a more sophisticated underwater life with 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea in 1872, but it was in the 20th century that the fascination really took hold.</p> <p>In the 1930s, American naturalist William Beebe and engineer Otis Barton collaborated on experimental submersibles called <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_eye/2015/09/02/the_bathysphere_and_the_discovery_of_deep_sea_marine_life_on_99_percent.html?via=gdpr-consent\">bathyspheres</a> which set records for deep diving and opened up the underwater realm of plants and animals to science.

It contained all the accoutrements of <em>la vie louche</em>, including television and radio. Cousteau used it as a base to explore the ocean in his yellow submarine, descending to 300 metres to capture the deepest footage yet recorded.</p> <p>His team spent 30 days beneath the waves, and in the process changed humanity\u2019s relationship with the ocean by proving that \u201csaturation diving\u201d could allow people to spend long periods underwater. By diving to a certain depth, divers saturate their bodies with the inert gases in air. This allows them to exist at the extreme pressure of the ocean floor. It typically involves breathing a mix of helium and oxygen, to avoid the possibility of the bends and nitrogen narcosis.</p> <p>Conshelf sparked a craze.

This is in large part due to the marine biologist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/06/oceanographer-sylvia-earle-the-world-is-holding-its-breath-for-australia\">Sylvia Earle</a>, one of the most famous explorers of her generation. In 1969, Earle made history with Mission 6, when she and an all-female team of scientists spent two weeks on Nasa\u2019s habitat <a href=\"https://seabeemagazine.navylive.dodlive.mil/2014/07/17/project-tektite-i-and-the-birth-of-the-underwater-construction-teams/\">Tektite</a> (named after meteor remnants on the seabed). This Virgin Islands research facility was for studying aquatic life \u2013 marine science, engineering and construction underwater \u2013 and small-crew psychology in extreme conditions. The research was for the Apollo missions and the moon landing was just months away.</p> <p>Built by General Electric, Earle and her team would enter Tektite through what she calls an \u201cunderwater door\u201d \u2013 emerging as if from a swimming pool into the deep-sea two-up, two-down apartment. It was dry, climate-controlled and comfortable, with carpets, bunks and a hot freshwater shower to wash off the salt. It even had a microwave.</p> <p>\u201cNasa had a team of psychologists watching to get insight into behaviour of living in isolation,\u201d says Earle today. \u201cWe were there as guinea pigs: our research was on the oceans, their research was on us.\u201d</p> <p>But Tektite wasn\u2019t just a research station \u2013 it was a vision of stylish underwater living. With their scientific gear and Charlie\u2019s Angels wetsuits in their Bond-villain lair, Earle and her team caused a media sensation.</p> <p>\u201cThey called us the aquababes, the aquanaughties, all sorts of things,\u201d Earle recalls with a snort. \u201cWe speculated what they would say about the astronauts if they were seen the same way \u2013 would they be the astrohunks?\u201d</p> <p>Habitats such as Glaucus, Conshelf and Tektite were built as tributes to humankind\u2019s abilities, but their true achievement was to spark an entirely different understanding of marine animals. \u201cBack then we could only explore using nets, and just saw dead bodies \u2013 not living creatures. Having the continuous interaction allowed us to get to know individual animals,\u201d Earle says. \u201c[In underwater habitats] we could stay, the way you look at bears or birds: we were there for the long haul, 24 hours a day or night. It was possible to see how a little group of damselfish reacted when a predator tried to swipe their eggs, for example.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"107f23d980ca9a675905b3ea847ecd66e1d9113d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/107f23d980ca9a675905b3ea847ecd66e1d9113d/0_175_4215_2529/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peggy Lucas with team leader Dr Sylvia Earle\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Engineer Peggy Lucas and team leader Dr Sylvia Earle in Nasa\u2019s Tektite habitat in the Virgin Islands.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"8a25664671cca5fd3dac51edbef503544c96852a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a25664671cca5fd3dac51edbef503544c96852a/0_147_2500_1582/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Artist\u2019s cutaway view of the Tektite II habitat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"633\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cutaway model of Nasa\u2019s Tektite II habitat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NOAA Central Library Historical Fisheries Collection</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76f95a49a585d6c3d54f8e0b5362f0f7669edbb1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76f95a49a585d6c3d54f8e0b5362f0f7669edbb1/0_186_5478_3288/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Sylvia Earle diving.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Sylvia Earle diving off Magic Point, New South Wales, Australia, with a Port Jackson shark in 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Sydney Morning Herald/Fairfax Media via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou look at a school of fish and they all look alike, but when you <em>really</em> look at them \u2013 well, it\u2019s like a bunch of people getting on the New York subway: a fish would say they all look the same, but we know they\u2019re different. Getting to appreciate the individuality of creatures other than humans was a breakthrough for me \u2013 it reinforces that you can\u2019t just lump them all together.\u201d</p> <p>But, in 1973, the world was shaken when Opec declared an oil embargo. Energy prices in the west skyrocketed. At first, the oil shock fuelled even wilder fantasies of a watery future, straight out of science fiction. Architects and designers imagined whole cities underwater, fed by hydropower stations, with deep-sea mining using freight submarines.</p> <p>Much like living in space, though, it\u2019s extremely difficult to live underwater. Aquanauts spending months in saturation suffered intense pressures on their body tissues \u2013 their brains, nervous systems. There were also interpersonal problems. As the marine biologist Helen Scales notes in her 2014 radio documentary <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04fzc7m\">The Life Sub-Aquatic</a>:\u201cIf you\u2019ve ever lived in a house with anyone, the first thing you do is storm out if you have a quarrel. You\u2019re not going to do that [underwater].\u201d</p> <p>Advances in robotics changed the game. Much of the research being done by Earle and her colleagues could be more efficiently performed by humans operating devices remotely from the surface. By the end of the 70s, the US government pulled back on its efforts. The moon missions were over. So, it seemed, were the ocean habitats.</p> <p>A few people refused to let the dream die. One was Australian <a href=\"http://www.lloydgodson.com/underwater-projects.html\">Lloyd Godson</a>. His habitat, BioSub, experimented with sustainability. Fuelled by solar panels, it featured a support system adapted from work by American high school students, with algae removing the CO2 from his exhalations and creating oxygen. In 2007 he moved in. It worked \u2013 sort of. \u201cBy day 12 I was lethargic, getting really irritated with people asking questions,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cMy wife told me to call it a day.\u201d</p> <p>In 2010 Godson spent 14 days underwater at the Legoland aquarium in Germany and used a fixed bicycle to set a world record for generating electricity underwater.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30599a1d35d873f6d6ca534e7dca309eb0332d25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30599a1d35d873f6d6ca534e7dca309eb0332d25/0_156_11896_14868/800.jpg\" alt=\"The SeaOrbiter designed by French architect Jacques Rougerie\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The SeaOrbiter, designed by French architect Jacques Rougerie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacques Rougerie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Better funded is the French architect Jacques Rougerie, who has built a career designing underwater habitats and environments. \u201cI had the pleasure of going on Cousteau\u2019s Calypso, participating in expeditions, talking to the crew \u2013 and what he created was a fascination for underwater living,\u201d Rougerie says from his office in Paris. \u201cThe early explorers opened the chamber of the possible for humanity. When you are underwater you feel like you\u2019re in a new dimension \u2013 floating in space, like an astronaut.\u201d</p> <p>Citing Leonardo da Vinci as an inspiration, Rougerie designs sea museums, underwater laboratories and habitats, and his foundation hosts an <a href=\"https://www.fondation-jacques-rougerie.com/\">annual competition</a> for students to conceive of underwater villages. Rougerie himself has twice lived for long periods underwater, and both times he didn\u2019t want to return to land. \u201cSadness invades you,\u201d he says. \u201cI was happy to come back and see family, but the first thing you think of is the next experience.\u201d</p> <p>Rougerie\u2019s ultimate goal remains that old 1960s dream: a proper underwater village, housing up to 250 people. In his vision, these aquanaut settlers would live in osmosis with the ocean, in a self-sufficient, autonomous community running on renewable marine energy such as tidal power, wave sensors and ocean thermals.</p> <p>Perhaps most ambitious of all is <a href=\"http://www.seaorbiter.com/\">SeaOrbiter</a>, Rougerie\u2019s take on the International Space Station for the ocean. It looks like a floating seahorse: two-thirds of its 51 metres are submerged, with panoramic windows, the lower section acting to stabilise a huge sail-shaped portion above water.</p> <p>\u201cThe goal, above all, is to help the climate and biodiversity by exploring across the grand currents of the ocean,\u201d he says. \u201cTo float 24/7 on a permanent structure, a combination of men and robots with a scientific purpose.\u201d</p> <p>Despite Rougerie\u2019s claims that he has secured Chinese investment, SeaOrbiter appears no closer to pushing off.</p> <p>Indeed, after all the projects of the past 50 years, only one permanent underwater habitat remains on the entire planet: <a href=\"https://medium.com/predict/aquarius-reef-base-an-actual-underwater-lab-and-the-last-of-a-dying-breed-eacb5b7989c7\">Aquarius Reef Base</a>, a research station run by Florida International University and which sits 20 metres down on the seabed off the Florida Keys.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9b07ca532794af8364d22c0dbe0d7de57b75984e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b07ca532794af8364d22c0dbe0d7de57b75984e/0_117_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fabien Cousteau waves from inside Aquarius Reef Base, a laboratory 63 feet below the surface in the waters off Key Largo, Florida in 2014\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fabien Cousteau waves from inside Aquarius Reef Base, an ocean-floor laboratory off Key Largo, Florida in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wilfredo Lee/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Aquarius plays host to a stream of people \u2013 scientists, film-makers, astronauts, even Jacques Cousteau\u2019s grandson Fabien \u2013 who want to experience time underwater.

In the 21st century, underwater \u201cliving\u201d has become almost exclusively the preserve of hotels and resorts that sell \u201cexperiences\u201d to guests via underwater glass ceilings and fish windows. The world\u2019s largest underwater <a href=\"https://under.no/\">restaurant</a> opened in Norway in 2019. Submerged hotels in the <a href=\"https://www.conradmaldives.com/\">Maldives</a>, <a href=\"http://www.poseidonresorts.com/\">Fiji</a>, Dubai and Singapore use elevators to take guests below the waterline, and feature amenities such as <a href=\"http://www.poseidonresorts.com/\">Poseidon\u2019s undersea chapel</a> (\u201cfor a wedding ceremony or vow renewal truly unlike any other\u201d), and are a lot more comfortable than Tektite ever was.</p> <p>Instead, the architects and scientists who still look to aquatic habitation spend most of their time thinking not about underwater cities, but floating ones. Long the refuge of the poorest city dwellers, such as the vast <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/feb/23/makoko-lagos-danger-ingenuity-floating-slum\">Makoko floating slum of homes on stilts in Lagos</a>, houses on water have become newly popular as waterfront property prices \u2013 and sea levels \u2013 have risen across the world.</p> <p>So far, most of this effort to colonise the water has gone into land reclamation projects, such as the Odaiba island in Tokyo, or South Korea\u2019s Songdo \u201csmart city\u201d. Architects in Dubai even tried to create a scale model of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/feb/13/not-end-the-world-return-dubai-ultimate-folly\">entire Earth off its coast</a>. However, reclamation is expensive, and requires constant maintenance to keep the ocean from reclaiming the space.

His firm <a href=\"https://www.waterstudio.nl/floating-cities-the-next-big-real-estate-boom/\">Waterstudio</a> builds floating buildings, mainly in the Netherlands, to help cities be more resilient. Recently, Olthuis started adding submerged levels to his structures. \u201cIn Holland the licences for dwellings on the water are small, but they say nothing about living underwater.\u201d</p> <p>The goal is partly ecological, Olthuis says. \u201cTen years ago, it was about proving that a structure did not have a negative effect \u2013 but now it\u2019s about also having a positive effect.\u201d He points to the \u201crigs to reefs\u201d principle where abandoned oil rigs have been transformed into habitats for ocean life. Waterstudio\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.waterstudio.nl/projects/sea-tree/\">Sea Tree</a><a href=\"https://www.waterstudio.nl/projects/sea-tree/\"> </a>builds on that concept: it\u2019s a platform that attracts birds, bees, fish and water plants into a single dense floating structure that can be moved between cities. He says the first Sea Trees have been commissioned by a Chinese developer in Kunming, who was asked to create a tourist attraction after a dam permanently altered the landscape.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-world-oceans-day\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-world-oceans-day&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-world-oceans-day&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The Bjarke Ingels Group last year revealed a concept for a buoyant municipality called <a href=\"https://oceanix.org/\">Oceanix City</a> \u2013 a modular system of floating islands clustered in multiples of six to form a kind of archipelago.

Rougerie says that time beneath the waves changes our outlook on the planet, helping inspire the environmental movement. It\u2019s why continues to sponsor the competition to design underwater cities. \u201cThe biggest threat to our ocean is man: pollution, chemical and plastic. But I\u2019m convinced that the young have a conscience and they\u2019ll do everything in their power \u2013 they\u2019re totally committed and willing to find a solution.\u201d</p> <p>Sylvia Earle, too, believes that man\u2019s understanding of the universe has been changed by underwater exploration. \u201cIn the last 50 years,\u201d she says, \u201ctwo major things have happened: the expansion of our technology into the skies above \u2013 which has given us great insights into the blue speck in the universe that we couldn\u2019t understand any other way \u2013 and going deep in the ocean, which has also changed everything.</p> <p>\u201cIt has taught us that life exists everywhere, even in the greatest depths; that most of life is in the oceans; and that oceans govern climate. Perhaps because we\u2019re so terrestrially biased, air-breathing creatures that we are, it has taken us until now to realise that everything we care about is anchored in the ocean.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the ocean that drives planetary systems \u2013 and we have done more harm to our life-support system in the last 50 years than we have in all previous human history,\u201d she says. \u201cIf we fail the ocean, nothing else matters.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Locust swarms threaten a \u201crolling emergency\u201d that could endanger harvests and food security across parts of Africa and Asia for the rest of the year, experts warn.</p> \n<p>An initial infestation of locusts in December was expected to die out during the current dry season. But unseasonal rains have allowed several generations of locust to breed, resulting in new swarms forming. </p> \n<p>Huge swarms of locusts have been causing devastation across swathes of Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Erratic weather conditions and storms have aided their path. As a result, countries have been battling the pests for months to avoid a hunger crisis.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3d69dfa8-21c8-416e-b666-8db3e4dc4393\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In normal times, locusts are not usually a threat.

As few as two locusts touching each other can create a connection that starts them forming into groups. This unlocks their destructive \u201cgregarious\u201d state that changes their behaviour and even colour.</p>\n    <p>Rains help the swarms to form. The moisture turns deserts into ideal habitats for breeding and the locusts feed off the growing vegetation.

A combination of ideal breeding conditions and a lack of control operations can allow unchecked breeding, which is what happened in Yemen in 2018.

But experts fear rains and insecurity in Somalia and South Sudan could undermine efforts in the east and Horn of Africa.</p> \n<p>Keith Cressman, locust forecasting expert for the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization, said that over the coming months locusts are expected to move farther north into Ethiopia and South Sudan. High food prices in South Sudan could compound the threat of hunger.</p> \n<p>\u201cEthiopia\u2019s going to be the recipient of swarms from Kenya and then also probably from Yemen so it\u2019s going to be busy for the whole&nbsp;year,\u201d said Cressman.</p> \n<p>Kenneth Kemucie Mwangi, from the Nairobi-based IGAD Climate Prediction and Applications Centre, which monitors 11 countries, said initial reports suggest 2,500 sq km of crop damage in Kenya, largely among marginalised communities.</p> \n<p>\u201cA lot of crop areas are in their planting stage and we\u2019ve already had reports in Turkana [county] that the herbaceous vegetation planted by the community to supplement their diet [has been damaged].

In one incident, a helicopter monitoring locusts almost sparked a standoff by accidentally crossing into South Sudan from Kenya. </p> \n<p>Security threats have prevented Kenya from carrying out cross-border spraying with Somalia, and also prevented the Somali government from conducting some aerial operations.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe minute a weak link is there, it means swarms are able to lay eggs in areas that cannot be covered and those swarms offer a new generation for a new invasion,\u201d said Mwangi.</p>",
  "<p>Fashion people love to exaggerate, but I have been to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/feb/15/the-view-from-the-front-row-a-history-of-the-fashion-show-photo-essay\">a lot of fashion shows</a> \u2013 about 3,000, by according to my back-of-envelope maths. Mostly in London, Paris, Milan and New York, but also Tokyo and Rio de Janeiro, Berlin and Edinburgh, Marrakech and Reykjavik. Twenty years of pret-a-porter and haute-couture collections \u2013 two of each every year, give or take two maternity leave gaps, a bout of appendicitis and the time I messed up my US visa \u2013 adds up to a lot of catwalk time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc817aac7edaa4e52b9b440201d62bff57076c18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc817aac7edaa4e52b9b440201d62bff57076c18/0_141_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Models present creations by the designer Marc Jacobs as part of his AW13 women\u2019s ready-to-wear fashion show for Louis Vuitton in Paris.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On track \u2026 models present creations by the designer Marc Jacobs as part of his autumn-winter 2013 women\u2019s ready-to-wear fashion show for Louis Vuitton in Paris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beno\u00eet Tessier/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But now, suddenly, the fashion show is over. No more impossibly beautiful people in ridiculously gorgeous (or just ridiculous) clothes. No more seating squabbles, no more front-row gossip, no more writing copy in the back of a minicab between shows. There are no real-life catwalks this season, with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/apr/21/london-fashion-week-to-go-online-only-as-lockdown-endures\">first all-digital London fashion week kicking off on Friday</a>, and online-only events scheduled for Paris and Milan next month. Most probably no physical shows for the rest of the year, with September\u2019s fashion weeks looking unlikely. And after that, who knows? Will social distancing and recession kill the catwalk for ever?</p> <p>The squash and squeeze of fashion week makes watching football from my seat in the west stand at the Emirates look like a Glyndebourne picnic, and is at odds with new protocols about how we navigate each other. But long before the pandemic it was clear that fashion shows were out of control. Fashion weeks in cities throughout the world, brands presenting six or eight collections a year rather than two, with lavish production and international travel added up to an indefensibly large carbon footprint. If the combined impact of social distancing, travel restrictions and recession is that the fashion week is reinvented as a virtual moment, there will be much to celebrate in that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a8c6d2a1f2f4754b4fd80c2e5edf768e4ea6ea9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8c6d2a1f2f4754b4fd80c2e5edf768e4ea6ea9c/0_221_3281_4098/801.jpg\" alt=\"Spikes and the star-spangled banner\u2026 Alexander McQueen takes a bow at the end of his spring-summer 2000 ready-to-wear show.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spikes and the star-spangled banner\u2026 Alexander McQueen takes a bow at the end of his spring-summer 2000 ready-to-wear show.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Marineau/Conde Nast/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But I will really, really miss fashion shows. They have brought me so much joy. My entry to fashion week coincided with the moment the catwalk was evolving from its second half of the 20th-century form \u2013 a chic but rule-bound, elite, inward-focused parade that served a clique of editors and buyers \u2013 into a stadium-sized pop cultural carnival.</p> <p>The first fashion week I attended, as this paper\u2019s new deputy fashion editor, was New York in September 1999. My trusty pre-Google paperback Dictionary of Fashion and Fashion Designers in no way prepared me to report on what I found. I remember <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/sep/14/interview-donatella-versace-my-brothers-death-made-me-strong\">Donatella Versace</a>\u2019s Versus show, where Madonna sat next to Rupert Everett on the front row \u2013 both in cowboy hats, I think \u2013 applauding Kate Moss as she strutted past us in white hot pants and gold boots. At Calvin Klein, Trish Goff wore a pencil skirt and plain fine-knit sweater with the sleeves pushed up and I had the feeling (one I have had many times since) of finally knowing exactly how I wanted to dress thereafter. Watching Naomi Campbell at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/mar/04/marc-jacobs-i-have-the-word-shameless-tattooed-on-my-chest\">Marc Jacobs</a>, and that season\u2019s new face \u2013 Gisele B\u00fcndchen \u2013 in a zebra-print bikini at Michael Kors, I was knocked out by the visceral power of the supermodel, goddess-made-flesh. And then there was a hurricane, and shows started getting cancelled. But the Alexander McQueen event went ahead, even though it took place on a pier in the Hudson.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c35a3a786c57198548eac52bf07778b80ff95c30\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c35a3a786c57198548eac52bf07778b80ff95c30/0_124_4926_2955/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trolleyed \u2026 Rihanna pushes model Cara Delevingne at the Chanel autumn-winter 2015 show in Paris.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trolleyed \u2026 Rihanna pushes model Cara Delevingne at the Chanel autumn-winter 2015 show in Paris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephane Cardinale - Corbis/Corbis/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Around the time of the millennium, McQueen was at the forefront of reinventing fashion as theatre. His rival for fashion\u2019s attention was John Galliano, who had begun turning Christian Dior Paris catwalks into psychedelic costume parades. McQueen and Galliano had very different aesthetics \u2013 Galliano vibrant and supersized, McQueen dark and lean \u2013 but both loved to shock their audiences.</p> <p>That night in New York, the models walked through a catwalk submerged in water. (Nothing to do with the hurricane, that was just the way that McQueen, with his uncanny instinct for the zeitgeist and apparently the weather, had planned the show.) After the model finale, a field of iron spikes rose up from the ground, their points skywards, and a troupe of dancers in burqa-like coverings pirouetted above them, suspended by silk ropes \u2013 an allusion to western fear of Islam that was made all the more unsettling when McQueen took his bow and dropped his baggy jeans on the catwalk to display stars-and-stripes boxer shorts. It was my first taste of the appetite-jolting salty-sweet lick of beauty and bombshell that a fashion week can be, and I was blown away. I suspect my reports were hopelessly breathless. I remember being halfway through reading one down the phone to the office in London, when the copytaker interrupted me, not unkindly, to ask: \u201cIs there much more, love?\u201d before sighing and audibly lighting another cigarette.</p> <p>Fashion shows are as much about drama as they are about clothes. I have admired hundreds of perfect boucl\u00e9&nbsp;tweed suits, but the Chanel shows I will never forget are those staged in a giant supermarket where Rihanna pushed Cara Delevingne down the soft-drink aisle in a shopping trolley, the one where a space rocket launched during the finale \u2013 and the one where a voice informed us just before the show that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/karl-lagerfeld\">M</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/karl-lagerfeld\"> Lagerfeld was indisposed</a>, and would not be attending that morning. He was 85, and had never missed one of his own shows before that; a month later, he was dead.</p> <p>There is a special thrill in the expectant wait for a debut show to begin \u2013 Raf Simons at Dior, where the atelier was wallpapered with thousands of fresh blooms; Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re at Louis Vuitton, where an earnest note from the designer was on every seat; Lindsay Lohan at Emanuel Ungaro \u2013 of which, well, the less said the better. There is the camp, Strictly-final emotion of a farewell show. (After two decades of these I can tell you that nobody blinks back tears as prettily, in immaculate black tie and with a poignant half smile, as Tom Ford.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"573f2cc0f3f1962891c16765cf50930b3fbe1f76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/573f2cc0f3f1962891c16765cf50930b3fbe1f76/0_0_658_1024/643.jpg\" alt=\"Hussein Chalayan\u2019s coffee table hooped skirt, London fashion week, February, 2000.\" width=\"643\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hussein Chalayan\u2019s coffee table hooped skirt, London fashion week, February 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sinead Lynch/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>On stage at Sadler\u2019s Wells in 2000, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/sep/15/hussein-chalayan-everything-we-build-and-design-in-a-way-reflects-the-body\">Hussein Chalayan</a> transformed chairs into dresses and a coffee table into a hooped skirt. When Marc Jacobs was at Louis Vuitton, a courtyard of the Louvre was decked out as a belle \u00e9poque railway station, and we sat on benches waiting for the show to begin. Then a real train trundled down the tracks and the models got out of it. That was eight years ago, and I still wonder how they did it.</p> <p>In 2007, Prince got up out of his front row seat at Matthew Williamson and did a set on the catwalk. In 2018, the actual Queen turned up at London fashion week. And yet for all the hoopla, some of the most perfect fashion moments have been those shows that are pure, old-school chic. Christian Lacroix\u2019s catwalk shows in Paris, when a red rose was left on every seat and his seamstresses cheered from the back rows. Yves Saint Laurent\u2019s final shows before his retirement, the audience squished on to tiny benches but thrilled to be there, the elegance austere and intoxicating as cold vodka. In recent seasons, The Row have conjured that same chic mood at their sublime New York fashion shows.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"68ee309884eca5af514d0a477777df93bf4bc874\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68ee309884eca5af514d0a477777df93bf4bc874/0_20_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prince performs before the Matthew Williamson spring/summer 2008 show at London fashion week\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prince performs before the Matthew Williamson spring/summer 2008 show at London fashion week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are cultural issues with fashion shows that run deeper than the logistics of social distancing and are as problematic, in their own way, as the events\u2019 carbon footprint. Whether you look on the catwalk or the front row, or at the Instagram influencers, the world view of fashion weeks skews sharply towards skinny white women. There is still a huge amount of work to be done on diversity, not just on model casting but in ensuring that people of colour are represented within brands\u2019 creative teams, and in audiences. There are still too few women at decision-making level within the fashion business. However, it is not true that fashion shows have nothing interesting to say. Jean Paul Gaultier was challenging gender stereotypes on the haute-couture catwalk back in 2002. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2019/apr/09/raf-simons-on-life-after-calvin-klein-ive-never-defined-myself-as-a-fashion-designer\">Raf Simons</a> used his debut at Calvin Klein in February 2017 to challenge Trump culture with a homage to an alternative vision of Americana. Maria Grazia Chiuri\u2019s Christian Dior shows have consistently placed feminism at the forefront of fashion-week conversation. Vivienne Westwood has made London fashion week a platform for climate activism. At New York fashion week, Pyer Moss designer Kerby Jean-Raymond has shown the power of being both an activist and a designer. In 2016, his collection was accompanied by the screening of a powerful film about police brutality against people of colour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aaa0f1fefa3001e9108d61b49a93da87267c4e5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aaa0f1fefa3001e9108d61b49a93da87267c4e5f/0_0_2464_1648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexander Mcqueen Spring-Summer 2004 Ready-To-Wear Collection In Paris, France On October 11, 2003.FRANCE - OCTOBER 11: Alexander McQueen spring-summer 2004 ready-to-wear collection in Paris, France on October 11, 2003 - Alexander McQueen.

The synchronised intake of breath that would sweep around the Tennis Club in Paris during a Phoebe Philo Celine show on first view of a particularly delicious polo neck. The camaraderie and hysteria that builds over the course of a month on the road. The time Anna Wintour jumped up and led a standing ovation for McQueen\u2019s They Shoot Horses Don\u2019t They? The backstage scrum to get close to a designer for a quote, which is usually mumbled or Delphic or both. (One season, I thought Miuccia Prada said her collection was about moccasins and another broadsheet fashion editor thought she had said it was about democracy; either was equally believable.) I will even miss people unfathomably bursting into tears at Comme des Gar\u00e7ons. All of this has been, frankly, a blast.</p> <p>But fashion must move with the times, Otherwise it\u2019s not fashion. The catwalk has reinvented itself a hundred times over, swapping ballgowns for streetwear, ditching stuffy salon shows in favour of popcorny clickbait. Digital is how we live now \u2013 so that\u2019s where the fashion show needs to live, too. The catwalk has a fabulous history, but fashion is about the future. So I\u2019ll be binge-watching the next season of fashion from here, at home on my laptop. And I can\u2019t wait.</p>",
  "<p>Never in my lifetime has the case of such visible injustice moved white and black people, moved them as human beings. There have been protests all across America. But there have been huge protests in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/jun/03/sing-his-name-thousands-gather-in-london-for-george-floyd-protest-video\">Britain</a>, in <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-pictures/photos-the-george-floyd-protests-go-global-1008934/\">Spain</a>, in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzLs6den37s\">Nigeria</a>, in fact all across the world. Why has the killing of George Floyd struck such a profound chord in us? Maybe it was that phrase: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d</p> <p>The consonance of the phrase with the very root of our pandemic fears is uncanny.&nbsp;The phrase linked the coronavirus with the ubiquitous and implacable nature of institutional racism. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d \u2013 yet people were prepared to risk being afflicted with coronavirus just so they could express their protest at the chokehold killing of a black man.</p> <p>There have been many times when black people have been gagged, strangled and choked by the police in the US, and even in Britain. The names of those who have died unjustly at the hands of the police are legion. And the police officers have mostly always gotten off entirely free. What happened to George Floyd isn\u2019t new. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d was uttered by another police victim, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/21/eric-garner-police-chokehold-firing-pantaleo\">Eric Garner</a>, less than a decade ago. But now there has been a crossover protest on a universal scale. This time is different. This time it is epochal. Language taps into primal fears.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When people say they are colour-blind they are being naive. They are in sweet denial. History is not colour-blind</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We don\u2019t really empathise when we understand. People understand racism. It isn\u2019t difficult to understand. But still people don\u2019t behave as if they understand. Perhaps we empathise best when we can enter into the condition. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d suddenly equates racism with the deprivation of air, which is what it always was. Previously we saw racism, if we saw it all, as a diminishment of a person\u2019s humanity. But that was always too vague. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d goes beyond saying that you are depriving me of freedom, of humanity, of respect. It says: \u201cYou are depriving me of the right to air itself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d: we need a new language to express the fundamental clarity of what happens when people are demonised, excluded, deprived, oppressed, and killed because of the colour of their skin. We need a new language, a phrase for that condition.</p> <p>Only an extreme, and terminal agony could have expressed the very heart of what racism does as when George Floyd said, almost in a whisper: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d Not even William Shakespeare, Walt Whitman, James Baldwin or Toni Morrison at their most eloquent came out with anything as simple in the genius of its truth as: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d</p> <p>Maybe it should be the phrase that people who are oppressed should use. It should become the mantra of oppression. Maybe every time the police stop you in your car for no other reason than that you are a black man or woman, you should say: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d Maybe every time people cross the road in the evenings when they see you, one should hold up a placard that says: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d Maybe when jobs are denied you, deserved promotions elude you, or when the police come to deport you, like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/20/its-inhumane-the-windrush-victims-who-have-lost-jobs-homes-and-loved-ones\">Windrush victims</a>, one should record the moment on one\u2019s phone while saying: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d Maybe the true response to all the subtle and deadly forms that racial discrimination takes should now have a new code: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d</p> <p>The truth is that \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d hints at the apocalypse of human values. When George Floyd said \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d and still the police officer applied the chokehold to his windpipe, it was declared in that moment that a human life means nothing in that country. That\u2019s where the apocalypse begins.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d will become the condition of the world. We ignore the deadly warnings of climate catastrophe.

Black Americans have had enough | Niambi Michele Carter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Maybe the real trouble is colour deficiency. We know what racism is. It is, finally, the reduction of the human race to the validity of one race. Put another way, it is saying that there is a hierarchy of being human, that some are more human than others, or that some are less. The moment you can think, even unconsciously, that one race is superior to another, that is the beginning of murder. It is the beginning of genocide. By small degrees what is innocently thought of as minor variations of a hierarchy of being human slowly becomes degenerates into allowing one set of people to suffer and endure conditions that another set of people would not tolerate, for a second, for themselves.</p> <p>Racism is a human thing. It is a human problem. It can be solved. All it takes is facing the truth that many of us have been lied to about history and about other people\u2019s humanity. All it takes is realising that to passively sanction the diminishment of anyone\u2019s humanity on any ground is to begin to sanction your own diminishment too. This really isn\u2019t rocket science. Racism is a failure of humanity. It is a failure to be human. This lack of empathy is part of the problem that is destroying the world. The lack of empathy extends not just to humans but to other species, and even to the planet as a whole.&nbsp;</p> <p>That police officer who pressed his knee on George Floyd\u2019s neck snuffed out one life, but lit a universal fire. It is deeply moving that the world has responded not to the death of a great man or woman, but to the killing of one of the Earth\u2019s poor and seemingly insignificant people.&nbsp;</p> <p>We know what to do. We must tear out the unconscious racism in our spirit. We must insist on the human rights of all peoples. We let people live their freedom, and their possibilities, within the law. This is a great moment in the life of humanity and it is rich with the possibilities for change.</p> <p>Maybe \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d will begin the real change that our world so desperately needs.

  "<p>The moment Gareth Thomas found out he was HIV positive, all he could imagine was the Aids epidemic. Sensational images of his future took over: frailty, shame, isolation, social exclusion. He remembered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/sep/04/how-we-made-dont-die-of-ignorance-aids-campaign\">Norman Fowler\u2019s tombstone advert</a> and the people with leprosy he learned about at school who were banished to colonies.

A BBC documentary, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0008yrh/gareth-thomas-hiv-and-me\">Gareth Thomas: HIV and Me</a>, aired shortly afterwards. He timed the announcement to coincide with his taking <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-wales-49713288/gareth-thomas-takes-on-ironman-wales-to-break-hiv-stigma\">part in an Ironman triathlon</a>. It was a carefully orchestrated media campaign to drive home a very simple message: HIV didn\u2019t weaken him. He was in control. His life was not over.</p> <p>Thomas is probably the most famous person who has talked about living in the UK with HIV. The Terrence Higgins Trust conducted a survey shortly after his announcement and found that 74% of British adults were aware he had HIV, which was helped by <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-50440058\">Prince Harry\u2019s public show of support</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I knew about HIV was everything I shouldn\u2019t have known about HIV,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was very historical, very past tense and very unfactual.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/04/living-with-hiv-always-get-asked-are-you-going-to-die\">Like many people living with HIV</a> today, Thomas takes one pill every day at 6am, which stops the virus from replicating in his body. Modern antiretroviral medication reduces the virus in the bloodstream to such an extent that a person becomes \u201cundetectable\u201d \u2013 they are unable to pass on the virus through sex.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef3006211760e6b3707c1714567ca759ddccd554\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef3006211760e6b3707c1714567ca759ddccd554/0_0_2204_1323/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gareth Thomas playing against the All Blacks for the Lions in 2005\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Playing against the All Blacks for the Lions in 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Gray/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The beginning of lockdown got him in a \u201cright old tizz\u201d, he says, speaking via Zoom from his home near Bridgend, Wales, where he lives with his husband, Stephen Williams-Thomas. Hearing the word \u201cvirus\u201d on the radio constantly brought him back to darker times \u2013 and the fear he felt about finding out he was HIV positive. He cried a lot.</p> <p>Now he is in a more comfortable rhythm. \u201cIn the first week of lockdown, I thought: I\u2019ve got to get super-fit, learn maths, read books and bake banana bread. There was all that pressure that you can\u2019t waste time. Now I just do the stuff I want to do.\u201d This includes walking the dog and spending lots of time with his husband, \u201cwhich is really nice because it\u2019s not something we are used to\u201d. His work, as a media commentator and campaigner, is at a \u201cbare minimum now\u201d, in contrast to its usual hectic pace \u2013 and the house-move just down the road that was supposed to be completed is on hold. \u201cI\u2019m not buying into the pressure of having to fill my time just because I\u2019ve got time.\u201d</p> <p>Is it hard to be still, as someone who built a career out of competing? \u201cPeople think competitors are winners, or people who have to concede. I\u2019m competitive because I enjoy competition \u2013 not because I feel like I have to achieve something. I really found this \u2013 not having any competition for probably the first time ever in this world \u2013 quite calming.\u201d</p> <p>He first got married in 2001, to Jemma Thomas, whom he had known at school. He came out to her in 2006, and she supported him through his public announcement of his&nbsp;sexuality. Their divorce was finalised in 2010 and Thomas married Stephen a few years ago, without fanfare. In fact, he made the marriage public only after revealing his HIV diagnosis, thanking his partner for his support. Carrying such a secret is familiar territory for Thomas \u2013 when he came out publicly in 2009 at the age of 35, becoming one of the first professional athletes to do so, he said he had endured \u201cyears of despair\u201d keeping his sexuality a secret from his wife, friends, family and colleagues. Even today, he shuts down any questions about his marriages.</p> <p>Thomas shot on to the professional rugby scene in 1994, aged 20, playing for his home town, Bridgend. He made his international debut just a year later against Japan. It was playing for Wales that cemented his reputation. Career highlights include captaining Wales in 2005 to the first grand slam in 27 years, in 2007, before going on to become the country\u2019s most capped rugby union player (he was overtaken by Stephen Jones in 2011).</p> <p>To come out in the macho world of rugby was, at the time, extraordinary. To come out as HIV positive in 2019 felt similarly enormous. \u201cIt felt much more shameful,\u201d he says. He won\u2019t say when he was first diagnosed, in order to protect his previous partners, but it was some time ago. Unlike his sexuality, he felt he would be blamed for his HIV status and told that he should have been more careful. \u201cThis was something that I felt people wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac8b5a76564534f8c4052ea1ab89cab910a77085\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac8b5a76564534f8c4052ea1ab89cab910a77085/0_69_3124_1874/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prince Harry attending a Terrence Higgins Trust event with Gareth Thomas at Twickenham last year\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prince Harry attending a Terrence Higgins Trust event with Thomas at Twickenham last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Parsons/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He would be proved right. For evidence that stigma against those with HIV is still very much alive, consider the manner with which Thomas was forced to tell his parents. One day, having stayed with them, his father was driving him to get a train to London. They noticed a man standing in the road. His father pulled over to check if he was OK.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a reporter. He stuck his head in the window and he said to my father: \u2018Do you have any comment about your son having HIV?\u2019 I put the window up and I said to my father: \u2018Just drive.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Thomas reassured his father that it was \u201cjust the press looking for a story\u201d. Thomas boarded the train to London and his father went home. The reporter followed his dad.</p> <p>\u201cHe knocked on the door and my mum and my dad answered,\u201d says Thomas. They noticed a recording device in the reporter\u2019s pocket. Again, the reporter asked them to comment on their son\u2019s HIV status. His parents refused and closed the door. \u201cThen I had the phone call from my mother, in tears. I have never felt like I was so far away from home in my entire life.\u201d</p> <p>When Thomas arrived back in Wales that night, he went to his parents\u2019 house and told them everything. They, too, had very little understanding about the realities of being HIV positive in the UK today. \u201cWhat this journalist didn\u2019t know is that my parents thought I was gonna die \u2013 they didn\u2019t know any different.\u201d</p> <p>Thomas and his legal team were granted an injunction<strong> </strong>preventing the newspaper from revealing that he was HIV positive. It was the catalyst for Thomas deciding to go public, however, and he began making the BBC documentary. Before its release, though, his legal team were unable to prevent a story running in the Sun about an unnamed sports star who was about to reveal that he had HIV.</p> <p>Thomas says the article was \u201cthe biggest load of bullshit to do with HIV\u201d. Why does he think there is still an appetite to expose people as HIV positive? \u201cBecause people don\u2019t know that much about HIV, it is a really easy subject to sensationalise. There are not that many public figures who are open about it.\u201d</p> <p>He is still angry about losing his autonomy over the situation. Thomas is incredibly close to his family, especially his parents, and is fiercely protective of them. \u201cIt was my right to pick the moment to tell my family about this. It wasn\u2019t somebody else\u2019s right to force that moment upon us. I can never pick that moment again. I never had that opportunity and that really pisses me off.\u201d</p> <p>Thomas has <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/gareth-thomas-says-a-tabloid-reporter-outed-him-as-hiv-to-his-parents-before-he-could-633945\">previously stated that</a> he would not have revealed his status were it not for newspaper threats to publish it. Now he is grateful that it is public. \u201cI actually feel kind of empowered and feel like I live a freer, happier life when I don\u2019t have secrets,\u201d he says.&nbsp;\u201cI\u2019m quite happy to shine a light on the negative moments in life.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75cbcf09d08ebc6b70e2ef66a5a4d152aaf9598c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75cbcf09d08ebc6b70e2ef66a5a4d152aaf9598c/215_1_3541_2125/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Celebrating after completing his first Ironman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Celebrating after completing his first Ironman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Huw Fairclough/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Thomas <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/dec/19/gareth-thomas-gay\">came out as gay</a>, he was the <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/international/britishandirishlionsrugby/6841818/Wales-and-Lions-full-back-Gareth-Thomas-reveals-he-is-gay.html\">first </a><a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/international/britishandirishlionsrugby/6841818/Wales-and-Lions-full-back-Gareth-Thomas-reveals-he-is-gay.html\">professional rugby union player</a> to do so. Since then, he has counselled other athletes on coming out, including a few footballers.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a media witch-hunt,\u201d says Thomas about the intense focus on the potential first openly gay Premier League player. \u201cIf it\u2019s taking up column inches now, when there isn\u2019t one, imagine what it will take up when the reality comes our way. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re helping to create an environment where the footballer could feel safe <strong> </strong>and protected.\u201d</p> <p>Thomas retired in 2011 and since then has appeared on Celebrity Big Brother and Dancing on Ice. At one stage, Mickey Rourke was going to adapt his story for the big screen and <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/super_league/celtic_crusaders/9385361.stm\">play the rugby star himself</a>, after reading about him in Sports Illustrated. Rourke apparently even hired a speech coach to <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/movie-star-mickey-rourke-set-94326\">help him master the Welsh accent</a>. The project is still in the works, although it won\u2019t be Rourke playing Thomas, he says.</p> <p>Now well adjusted to his retirement from professional rugby, Thomas doesn\u2019t miss playing much, although he does miss the camaraderie and the structure it gave him. He will probably be remembered as much for his achievements off the field as those on them \u2013 he has used his platform to champion issues close to him: LGBTQ+ equality, mental health and, more recently, raising awareness about HIV.
