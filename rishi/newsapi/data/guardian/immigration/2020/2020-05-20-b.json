That is the question in my view,\u201d said Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.</li> \n   <li><strong>International imports and exports have fallen to their lowest level for at least four years</strong>, according to World Trade Organization figures.

that the country has achieved one of the lowest fatality rates among the OECD nations, well below the global average of 6.8%.</p> \n  <p>However, a document published last week from the Civil Register revealed 4,201 deaths in caused by \u201crespiratory disease\u201d between 3 March and 29 April. </p> \n  <p>Compared to data from the Department of Health Statistics and Information (DEIS), this would indicate a 57.2% increase in respiratory deaths from the year before, suggesting that this year\u2019s excess of 2,000+ respiratory-related deaths could be related to the novel coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>The information, tweeted by investigative journalist and scholar Alejandra Matus, sparked a frenzy of comment on social media.</p> \n  <p>Within hours of the post going viral, the Health

Thank you for following along \u2013 and, always, to those of you who reached out on Twitter and via email. </p> \n  <p>Here are the most important developments from the last few hours:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Global confirmed cases near 4.9 million. </strong>According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 323,286 people are known to have died from Covid-19 while at least 4,897,567 are confirmed as having been infected since the outbreak began. The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the scale of the pandemic due to differing testing and statistical recording regimes, as well as suspected undercounting.</li> \n   <li><strong>Trump says the US having the highest cases worldwide is a \u2018badge of honour\u2019. </strong>The US president told reporters at a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-cabinet-meeting-17/\">cabinet meeting</a> that the high number of cases in the US \u2013 far higher than any other country \u2013 is a \u201cbadge of honour\u201d, because it means the US is testing the most. Trump told reporters: \u201cYou know when you say that we lead in cases, that\u2019s because we have more testing than anybody else.\u201d He said he looks at the number \u201cin a certain respect, as being a good thing because it means our testing is much better.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/singapore-sentences-man-to-death-via-zoom-call\">Singapore sentences man to death via Zoom call</a>. </strong>A man has been sentenced to death in Singapore via a Zoom video-call for his role in a drug deal, the city-state\u2019s first case where capital punishment has been delivered remotely.Punithan Genasan, a 37-year-old Malaysian, received the sentence for his role in a 2011 heroin transaction on Friday, court documents showed, with the country under lockdown to try to curb one of the highest coronavirus rates in Asia.</li> \n   <li><strong>UN chief praises Africa\u2019s efforts to stem virus. </strong>UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said on Wednesday that the developed world could learn lessons from the preventative measures taken by many African countries to stem the spread of the coronavirus. There have been fewer than 3,000 Covid-19 deaths from 88,000 cases of the disease registered throughout the African continent, relatively low numbers compared with over 320,000 deaths worldwide.</li> \n   <li><strong>Brazil confirms record daily rise in deaths and cases. </strong>Brazil has confirmed a record 17,408 cases in the last 24 hours and a record 1,179 deaths. The country has 271,628 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 17,971 people have died. Hospital officials say more than 85% of intensive care beds in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo are full.</li> \n   <li><strong>Covid-19 crisis will push 60m into poverty says World Bank chief. </strong>Coronavirus shutdowns around the world could undo three years of gains in alleviating poverty, the president of the World Bank has said. David Malpass said that up to 60 million people could be pushed below the poverty line, according to World Bank estimates, as the global economy shrinks by around 5%.</li> \n   <li><strong>US president claims hydroxychloroquine study is \u2018Trump enemy statement\u2019. </strong>Trump claimed a recent US study indicating hydroxychloroquine was not an effective coronavirus treatment was a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/19/trump-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-white-house\">\u201cTrump enemy statement\u201d</a>. \u201cIf you look at the one survey, the only bad survey, they were giving it to people that were in very bad shape,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey were very old.

He is the only one working and he\u2019s the one that gets the food from the bush,\u201d said Moni.</p> <p>\u201cWe need the boys to go out to fish, to get the taro, cassava and yam for the pot. The government needs to open up the border and bring our boys back home.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Overseas health and care workers on the coronavirus frontline reacted with fury on Wednesday after Boris Johnson refused to exempt them from the NHS surcharge, insisting that it was \u201cthe right way forward\u201d.</p> \n<p>In interviews with the Guardian, migrant health workers \u2013 who face an NHS bill of as much as \u00a32,500 a year for a family of four \u2013 spoke out over a relentless working environment, struggles to pay their rent, and a heavy toll on their family life. \u201cWe feel insulted,\u201d one said. \u201cWe are putting our lives and our family\u2019s lives at risk.\u201d</p> \n<p>The prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/19/uk-government-urged-to-scrap-624-nhs-charge-for-migrant-care-workers-helping-combat-coronavirus\">resisted pressure from Labour\u2019s Keir Starmer to amend the policy</a>, telling MPs that he \u201caccepts and understands the difficulties faced by our amazing NHS staff\u201d but added: \u201cWe must look at the realities \u2026 those contributions help us to raise about \u00a3900m.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/19/nhs-surcharge-tories-key-workers-government-healthcare\">The NHS surcharge shows what the Tories really think of key workers | Maya Goodfellow</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Later the IFS estimated that the contribution from overseas NHS staff amounted to around \u00a390m.</p> \n<p>The workers who spoke to the Guardian described what they saw as a \u201cstruggle\u201d to manage the costs of the surcharge alongside rising visa fees.

It\u2019s a struggle to pay my rent and I\u2019ve never had a holiday. I pay \u00a3500 every month towards my debts for previous fees and next year I have to pay another set. I don\u2019t know yet how I will pay them.\u201d </p> \n<p>The surcharge has become a heated political issue since the coronavirus crisis began, with politicians and health bodies urging the government to scrap it for migrant care workers after it was paused for a year for doctors, nurses and paramedics.</p> \n<p>The NHS fee of \u00a3400 a year for migrant care workers coming from outside the European Economic Area is paid regardless of use of healthcare services.

These surcharges, which run into the thousands for a family of four, can be crippling for frontline NHS workers. Doctors from overseas have told us that this policy has made them feel unwelcome in the UK. The fact that the charge has been increased even further during the Covid pandemic has decimated morale amongst our overseas workforce.\u201c<br><br>\u201dWe were grateful to Sir Keir Starmer for reading out our letter to the Home Office at PMQs today and would welcome an amendment to the Immigration Bill to exempt NHS healthcare workers from the surcharge.\u201d</p> \n<p>Migrant Voice director, Nazek Ramadan, said: \u201cAn average family of four now has to pay nearly \u00a350,000 over the 10 years from arriving in the UK to getting citizenship.</p> \n<p>\u201cOrdinary families are being stripped bare. We know parents who are faced with the choice between feeding their children and renewing their visas.\u201d</p> \n<p>A government spokesperson said: \u201cTo bring peace of mind and to recognise the contribution of frontline NHS and other eligible health workers during this pandemic, we announced free and automatic visa extensions for them, including an exemption from the immigration health surcharge.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cNHS Trusts and other employers also offer schemes to support NHS staff in making the payment - in many cases covering the cost of the surcharge themselves. In the longer-term it is right that we ensure a contribution is made to reflect the cost of providing NHS treatment and the surcharge has raised \u00a3900m for the NHS.\u201d</p>",

His commitment at prime minister\u2019s questions in the Commons came as the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said there had been no effective tracing in the country for 10 weeks. Johnson said: \u201cI have great confidence that by 1 June we will have a system that will enable us, help us very greatly to defeat this disease and move the country forward.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Record number of tests conducted</strong></p> \n  <p>A record 177,216 coronavirus tests were carried out in the 24 hours to 9am this morning. The figures were announced after Johnson restated his ambition to get the daily total up to 200,000 by the end of this month. The figures have often been criticised as misleading. Statistics on the Department of Health and Social Care\u2019s website show that although there were 177,216 tests, only 60,744 individuals actually got tested during this 24-hour period. The figures now also include tests carried out for survey purposes, including antibody tests to see if people have had the disease. These survey tests account for 23,601 of the daily total.</p> \n  <p><strong>UK death toll rises by 363</strong></p> \n  <p>A further 363 Covid-19 deaths were announced in the UK, taking the total to 35,704. The number of coronavirus patients in hospital in England had fallen below 10,000 for the first time since March.</p> \n  <p><strong>Government wants tourism to resume in July</strong></p> \n  <p>The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, has said the government plans to allow tourism to begin in July. Speaking at the daily Downing Street briefin he said: \u201cI would love to get the tourism sector up as quickly as we possibly can. We\u2019ve set this very ambitious plan to try and get it up and running by the beginning of July. Dowden also announced plans to up a taskforce to help people in the recreation and leisure industries get their sectors back to work again.</p> \n  <p><strong>Bereavement scheme extended</strong></p> \n  <p>The government has bowed to pressure to give families and dependants of migrant NHS support staff who die as a result of contracting coronavirus will be granted indefinite leave to remain. The move follows criticism that care workers, cleaners and porters had been left out of the scheme, which only applied to certain occupations including nurses, biochemists and radiographers. Announcing the move, the home secretary, Priti Patel, said: \u201cWe are extending the scheme to NHS support staff and social care workers. We want to ensure families have the support they need and so this will be effective immediately and retrospectively.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>EU response chief warns of second wave</strong></p> \n  <p>The prospect of a second wave of coronavirus infection across Europe is no longer a distant theory, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments \u2013 including the UK\u2019s \u2013 on disease control. \u201cThe question is when and how big, that is the question in my view,\u201d said Dr Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. In an interview with the Guardian she added: \u201cIt\u2019s not the time now to completely relax.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Rolls-Royce plans to cut 9,000 jobs</strong></p> \n  <p>The Derby based engineering firm Rolls-Royce has announced plans to cut at least 9,000 jobs \u2013 almost a fifth of its workforce, with UK factories set to be hardest hit. Negotiations are beginning with trade unions before any figures for job losses in the UK are agreed but Warren East, the company\u2019s chief executive, said most of the cuts would be in its civil aerospace business. Demand for aircraft, and the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce, have slumped across the world in large part due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n  <p><strong>Northern Ireland set to track and trace for at least a year</strong></p> \n  <p>Stormont\u2019s health minister, Robin Swann, has announced the contact-tracing programme for Northern Ireland is set to last for at least a year. He said a pilot programme that began at the start of April to track contacts associated with all confirmed cases of Covid-19 would be ramped up to a seven-day operation and would last for at least a year. Five more people were reported to have died of coronavirus in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland\">Northern Ireland</a> taking its total to 494.</p> \n  <p><strong>Wales rules out setting \u2018arbitrary\u2019 date for reopening schools</strong></p> \n  <p>The Welsh education minister, Kirsty Williams, has said she will not set an \u201carbitrary\u201d date for when more children will return to school. She said more evidence \u2013 and more confidence in the evidence \u2013 on Covid-19 was needed before schools would open to more children. Public Health Wales has announced 14 more deaths from coronavirus, taking the total in Wales to 1,238.</p> \n  <p><strong>Sturgeon denies cover-up over early cases</strong></p> \n  <p>Nicola Sturgeon has denied the Scottish government tried to cover up coronavirus cases linked to a Nike conference in Edinburgh in late February. In angry exchanges at first minister questions, Sturgeon accused the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Jackson Carlaw, of unfairly impugning her integrity and that of health officials by suggesting this early outbreak was hushed up. Last week it revealed that there were multiple transmissions of coronavirus in Edinburgh on 26 and 27 February, well before the first confirmed case in the country on 1 March, but that this was not disclosed to the public. A total of 2,184 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus, an increase of 50 since Tuesday.</p> \n  <p><strong>UK universities facing \u00a3760m hit</strong></p> \n  <p>British universities face a potential \u00a3760m blow to their funding after about one in five students said they would not enrol in the next academic year if classes were delivered online and other activities curtailed. A survey of students applying for undergraduate places found that more than 20% said they were willing to delay starting their courses if universities were not operating as normal due to the coronavirus pandemic, which would mean there would be 120,000 fewer students when the academic year begins in autumn. A number of universities including Cambridge have said they will conduct all lectures online throughout the 2020-21 academic year.</p> \n  <p><strong>Outsourcing firm apologises for sharing details of hundreds of contract tracers</strong></p> \n  <p>The outsourcing firm Serco has apologised after accidentally sharing the email addresses of almost 300 contact tracers. The company is training staff to trace cases of Covid-19 for the UK government. It made the error when it emailed new trainees to tell them about training. Serco said it had apologised and would review its processes \u201cto make sure that this does not happen again\u201d. Labour said the breach raised serious questions for the government about the capability of Serco to command public confidence.</p> \n  <p><strong>MoD set to scale down size of Covid support force</strong></p> \n  <p>The Ministry of Defence is poised to announce a reduction in the numbers of military personnel ready to tackle the coronavirus crisis in the UK to 7,500 from 20,000. These are soldiers and other members of the armed forces \u201cheld at readiness\u201d so they can be deployed quickly if needed by civilian authorities, but with only 4,000 currently being used and the national situation slowly improving it has been decided fewer troops are required on standby.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T18:07:14.222Z\">at 7.07pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec56ac18f0886ce4f5d74b9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T17:40:44.222Z\">6.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Bereavement scheme extended</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The government has bowed to pressure to give indefinite leave to remain to families and dependants of migrant NHS support staff who die as a result of contracting coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>The move follows criticism that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/07/foreign-nationals-nhs-indefinite-leave-remain-coronavirus-covid-19\">care workers, cleaners and porters had been left out of the scheme</a>, which only applied to certain occupations including nurses, biochemists and radiographers.</p> \n  <p>The extension of the scheme \u2013 which was originally announced last month \u2013 to include cleaners, porters, social care staff and care home workers will be effective immediately and retrospectively, the Home Office confirmed.</p> \n  <p>The home secretary, Priti Patel, said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Every death in this crisis is a tragedy, and sadly some NHS support staff and social care workers have made the ultimate sacrifice in the pursuit of saving the lives of others.</p> \n   <p>When I announced the introduction of the bereavement scheme in April, I said we would continue to work across government to look at ways to offer further support.

But these figures have often been criticised as misleading. As <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public\">the detailed statistics on the Department of Health and Social Care\u2019s website</a> show, although there were 177,216 tests, only 60,744 individuals actually got tested during this 24-hour period. The figures now also include tests carried out for survey purposes, including antibody tests (which show if you have had the virus, not if you have it now). These survey tests account for 23,601 of the daily total.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Dowden said for the \u201cvast majority\u201d of people the new government \u201cstay alert\u201d advice means they should stay at home.</strong> The \u201cstay alert\u201d slogan only applies to England, because the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland administrations have not adopted it. Dowden said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Staying alert, for the vast majority of people, still means staying at home as much as possible.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This sounded like an attempt to counter the impression conveyed by some ministerial messages that the government is in a rush to end the lockdown.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Dowden said he was setting up a taskforce to help people in the recreation and leisure industries get their sectors back to work again.</strong> (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/may/20/uk-coronavirus-live-school-rebellion-english-primaries-pmqs-covid-19-latest-news-updates?page=with:block-5ec558928f0864e579f149b1#block-5ec558928f0864e579f149b1\">5.21pm.)</a></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Prof Stephen Powis, the medical director of NHS England, said the number of coronavirus patients in hospital in England had fallen below 10,000 for the first time since March.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Dowden said he wanted tourism to resume in July.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I would love to get the tourism sector up as quickly as we possibly can.

Also very little independent study or research about how the app might function seems to be in place to understand the use patterns as they unfold. Technology use generally brings in unintended consequences, and it is difficult to know what these will be.</p> \n   <p>Manual tracing alone is too slow, and if there is a second spike it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to locate the contacts faster than the rate of new contacts are becoming exposed. The rapid transmission of the virus between people, is faster than the time it takes to do the needed detective work and phone calls to alert all exposed individuals. However, an app will not work on its own either, so best way forward would be a combined approach.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Dr Joshua Moon, research fellow at the University of Sussex Business School, said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I have my doubts that this target will be met, given the issues with the app and the need to train contact tracers. Even then, 1 June is delayed at best - this is a system which should have been in place before the pandemic even started. Accounting even for this, the system is delayed in its scale up.</p> \n   <p>On top of this, the system needs an additional component: isolate. Testing, tracking, and tracing contacts and patients is not going to stop this pandemic unless patients are isolated, and contacts are tested and isolated. This system is going to have to develop as we go along, we need to pay attention to how well it works and adapt as we go along.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Rowland Kao, professor of veterinary epidemiology and data science, University of Edinburgh, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Any voluntary use of the app would have to be supplemented by traditional contact tracing employing large numbers of people. As it is expected that all of these people will be newly trained, one should expect teething problems and therefore a considerable lag time before the contact-tracing programme is as effective as it could be and when surveillance and testing will therefore play its biggest role in ensuring that infection numbers stay low.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T15:57:14.743Z\">at 4.57pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec54e768f0886ce4f5d7349\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T15:49:20.843Z\">4.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Barnier says 'new dynamism' needed to stop UK-EU trade talks ending in failure</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Yesterday No 10 released the text of <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/886168/Letter_to_Michel_Barnier_19.05.20.pdf\">a letter (pdf)</a> sent by <strong>David Frost</strong>, the PM\u2019s chief Europe adviser, to <strong>Michel Barnier</strong>, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, in which Frost complained that the EU was just offering the UK \u201ca relatively low-quality trade agreement coming with unprecedented EU oversight of our laws and institutions\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Barnier has now released<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/brexit_files/info_site/uktf-20203060790-mb-reply-to-df-wd.pdf\"> the text of his reply (pdf)</a>. In it, he confirms that Frost has proposed aiming for a less ambitious trade deal than originally envisaged, giving up on the aim of a zero-tariff, zero-quota agreement. (Barnier objects, saying this might take more time, and would not resolve the level playing field dispute anyway.) He says \u201cnew dynamism\u201d is needed to avoid the talks ending in stalemate.</p> \n  <p>And he restates the longstanding EU claim that the UK wants to \u201ccherry pick\u201d - to enjoy the benefits of EU membership, but not the obligations. Barnier says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Regardless of what your letter suggests, there is no automatic entitlement to any benefits that the EU may have offered or granted in other contexts and circumstances to other, often very different, partners. </p> \n   <p>Every agreement that the EU has concluded is unique, with its own balance of rights and obligations, tailored to the partner and era in which it is concluded. There is no model, no uniform precedent to follow in EU trade policy. </p> \n   <p>Neither is there a right to what you admit are unprecedented UK proposals in a number of areas. Just as we do not accept selective benefits in the single market without the corresponding obligations, we also do not accept cherry picking from our past agreements. The EU is looking to the future, not to the past, in these negotiations.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e0cd5bf3a0ff61fdf582811dee2f6cd7579dbb21\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0cd5bf3a0ff61fdf582811dee2f6cd7579dbb21/0_40_4645_2787/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michel Barnier.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michel Barnier.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicolas Landemard/Le Pictorium Agency via Zuma/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T15:55:08.423Z\">at 4.55pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec54e058f0864e579f14933\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T15:35:31.828Z\">4.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67a9d2e82d071b3123828048e26c9a3a68c09bb4\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67a9d2e82d071b3123828048e26c9a3a68c09bb4/0_89_4986_2992/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ellis Tustin, grandson of Berrice Moore, holds up his grandfather\u2019s name staging a protest outside the Houses of Parliament today.

His commitment at prime minister\u2019s questions in the Commons came as the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said there had been no effective tracing in the country for 10 weeks. Johnson said: \u201cI have great confidence that by 1 June we will have a system that will enable us, help us very greatly to defeat this disease and move the country forward.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>EU response chief warns of second wave</strong></p> \n  <p>The prospect of a second wave of coronavirus infection across Europe is no longer a distant theory, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments \u2013 including the UK\u2019s \u2013 on disease control. \u201cThe question is when and how big, that is the question in my view,\u201d said Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. In an interview with the Guardian she added: \u201cIt\u2019s not the time now to completely relax.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Rolls-Royce plans to cut 9,000 jobs</strong></p> \n  <p>The Derby based engineering firm Rolls-Royce has announced plans to cut at least 9,000 jobs \u2013 almost a fifth of its workforce, with UK factories set to be hardest hit. Negotiations are beginning with trade unions before any figures for job losses in the UK are agreed but Warren East, the company\u2019s chief executive, said most of the cuts would be in its civil aerospace business. Demand for aircraft, and the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce, have slumped across the world in large part due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n  <p><strong>Northern Ireland set track and trace for at least a year</strong></p> \n  <p>Stormont\u2019s health minister, Robin Swann, has announced the contact-tracing programme for Northern Ireland is set to last for at least a year. He said a pilot programme that began at the start of April to track contacts associated with all confirmed cases of Covid-19 would be ramped up to a seven-day operation and would last for at least a year. Five more people were reported to have died of coronavirus in Northern Ireland taking its total to 494.</p> \n  <p><strong>Wales rules out setting \u2018arbitrary\u2019 date for reopening schools</strong></p> \n  <p>The Welsh education minister, Kirsty Williams, has said she will not set an \u201carbitrary\u201d date for when more children will return to school. She said more evidence \u2013 and more confidence \u2013 in the evidence around Covid-19 was needed before schools would open to more children. Public Health Wales has announced 14 more fatalities from coronavirus, taking the death toll in Wales to 1,238. </p> \n  <p><strong>Sturgeon denies cover-up over early cases</strong></p> \n  <p>Nicola Sturgeon has denied the Scottish government tried to cover up coronavirus cases linked to a Nike conference in Edinburgh in late February. In angry exchanges at first minister questions, Sturgeon accused the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Jackson Carlaw, of unfairly impugning her integrity and that of health officials by suggesting this early outbreak was hushed up. Last week it revealed that there were multiple transmissions of coronavirus in Edinburgh on 26 and 27 February, well before the first confirmed case in the country on 1 March, but that this was not disclosed to the public. A total of 2,184 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus, an increase of 50 since Tuesday.</p> \n  <p><strong>UK universities facing \u00a3760m hit </strong></p> \n  <p>British universities face a potential \u00a3760m blow to their funding after about one in five students said they would not enrol in the next academic year if classes were delivered online and other activities curtailed. A survey of students applying for undergraduate places found that more than 20% said they were willing to delay starting their courses if universities were not operating as normal due to the coronavirus pandemic, which would mean there would be 120,000 fewer students when the academic year begins in autumn. A number of universities including Cambridge have said they will conduct all lectures online throughout the 2020-21 academic year. </p> \n  <p><strong>Outsourcing firm apologises for sharing details of hundreds of contract tracers</strong></p> \n  <p>The outsourcing firm Serco has apologised after accidentally sharing the email addresses of almost 300 contact tracers. The company is training staff to trace cases of Covid-19 for the UK government. It made the error when it emailed new trainees to tell them about training. Serco said it had apologised and would review its processes \u201cto make sure that this does not happen again\u201d.</p> \n  <p><strong>MoD set to scale down size of Covid support force</strong></p> \n  <p>The Ministry of Defence is poised to announce a reduction in the numbers of military personnel ready to tackle the coronavirus crisis in the UK to 7,500 from 20,000. These are soldiers and other members of the armed forces \u201cheld at readiness\u201d so they can be deployed quickly if needed by civilian authorities, but with only 4,000 currently being used and the national situation slowly improving it has been decided fewer troops are required on standby.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T15:31:16.035Z\">at 4.31pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec534688f0864e579f147e4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/daniel-boffey\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T13:47:27.723Z\">2.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The prospect of a second wave of coronavirus infection across <strong>Europe </strong>is no longer a distant theory, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments \u2013 including the UK \u2013 on disease control.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe question is when and how big, that is the question in my view,\u201d says Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).</p> \n  <p>It has been the unenviable task of scientists to tell it as it is through the coronavirus pandemic.

Here are the main points. Unlike other lobby briefings, the post-PMQs one includes briefing from a source able to comment on political matters, as well as briefing from the PM\u2019s civil service spokesman (the official spokesman).</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The prime minister\u2019s spokesman confirmed that the PM\u2019s commitment to have the contact-tracing system up and running by 1 June was a firm pledge - even though at one point in PMQs Johnson only said he had \u201cgrowing confidence\u201d on this point.</strong> (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/may/20/uk-coronavirus-live-school-rebellion-english-primaries-pmqs-covid-19-latest-news-updates?page=with:block-5ec517098f0864e579f14631#block-5ec517098f0864e579f14631\"> 1.07pm.)</a></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>But the spokesman also refused to back what Prof Dame Angela McLean, the government\u2019s deputy chief scientific adviser, said yesterday about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/19/uk-coronavirus-live-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ec40df78f0864e579f13e6e#block-5ec40df78f0864e579f13e6e\">it being essential for a contact-tracing system to be in place before any further lockdown measures could be lifted.</a> </strong>Asked if the PM agreed, the spokesman said that the government would be guided by the best scientific advice and that it would only open schools when it was safe to do so. He also stressed that, in the Commons this afternoon, the PM said a contact-tracing system would be in place by 1 June.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said the contact-tracing system would launch before the NHS contact-tracing app was ready to be rolled out nationwide.</strong> The app is supposed to be one element of the new contact tracing system. But the government now talks about \u201ctest and trace\u201d, not \u201ctest, track and trace\u201d. As the Guardian reports today, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/uk-plans-for-contact-tracing-in-doubt-as-app-not-ready-until-june\">rolling out the app has been hit by some setbacks.</a> Yesterday the health minister Lord Bethell told peers the government would begin with the tracing rather than with the app. Asked about this comment, the spokesman said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t disagree with that.\u201d</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said the ONS was planning to publish more information about R, the reproduction number, tomorrow.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said the government had no plans to reconsider the two-metre rule. </strong>This morning <strong>Prof Robert Dingwall</strong>, a government adviser who sits on Nervtag (the new and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group) told <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8339837/Government-scientist-says-2m-social-distancing-rule-based-fragile-evidence.html\">the BBC that the evidence for this was \u201cvery fragile\u201d</a> and that other countries adopted a different approach.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, will take the government press conference this afternoon, the spokesman said. </strong>He will appear with Prof Stephen Powis, the medical director for NHS England.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>A source said that the Conservative party was still making plans for its autumn conference to go ahead</strong>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/lib-dems-urged-to-axe-party-conference-and-switch-to-virtual-format-due-to-coronavirus\">Labour has abandoned its normal conference</a>, and instead plans an online event. Asked about the Tory one, a source said that planning for it continued but that this was being kept under review. He said any final decision about whether to go ahead with it would be taken on the basis of the latest scientific and medical advice.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>A source defended the government\u2019s decision to try to install Sir Bernard Jenkin as chair of the liaison committee.</strong> The liaison committee comprises all select committee chairs, and its most prominent job is to take evidence from the prime minister several times a year. Johnson has still not appeared before it at all, even though he became PM 10 months ago. This evening MPs will be asked to vote on a government motion setting up the committee, with Jenkin as chair, even though Jenkin does not currently chair a select committee. Labour MPs are backing an amendment saying only a serving committee chair should be eligible to chair the liaison committee. They think No 10 wants Jenkin in the post because he will be soft on the PM. Asked why No 10 wanted Jenkin, a source said Jenkin was \u201ca distinguished backbencher\u201d with \u201ca long track record of holding governments to account\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p

She said: \u201cThe cases from the Nike conference where all reported in the normal way through our daily figures. The reason that we didn\u2019t say where these people got the virus was down to patient confidentiality.\u201d She said as so few people were infected at the time, revealing the link to the conference would have risked revealing patient identities. </p> \n  <p>Carlaw insisted that the public should have been told. He accepted there was a balance to be struck between patient confidentiality and public health, but he added: \u201cFor coronavirus that balance must clearly sit in favour of protecting the public\u2019s health. We do have a right to know.\u201d </p> \n  <p>He said the contact tracing that followed the conference didn\u2019t happen at the appropriate scale. Sturgeon rejected this. She pointed out that 60 people in Scotland an a further 50 people in England were contacted after the conference. She said: \u201cLet\u2019s not engage in ridiculous language of secrecy are covered up to cover. It doesn\u2019t impugn my integrity, but it actually starts to impugn the integrity of the experts who managed this outbreak, including, I have to say Public Health England, who were part of the expert management team.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Sturgeon confirmed that she would set out details on Thursday about how Scotland proposes to ease its lockdown measures. She said she was encouraged by the latest data showing a slower rise in the death rate from the disease. </p> \n  <p>She said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The trends we are seeing do matter, and they provide further grounds for encouragement, in particular the number of Covid-19 deaths has fallen for the third week, and are almost half the level three weeks ago.

At first he resorted to bluster, accusing Starmer of ignorance and quoting broad-brush testing statistics to avoid the more specific question about why care homes are still not routinely able to access the level of testing that is supposed to be available. Challenging Starmer on fact is normally a grievous error, but instead of pressing him repeatedly on this, the Labour leader moved on to contact tracing. Johnson had a moderately effective retort when he claimed that Starmer was asking about matters which he had already been briefed on privately (which may well be true, although there is merit in Starmer forcing the PM to put these matters on the record), but what worked best for Johnson was that he was able actually announce something: that contact tracing will be up and running on 1 June, and able to trace 10,000 contacts a day. </p> \n  <p>Starmer did not seem to have anticipated this, allowing Johnson to accuse him of not listening. For the final two questions, on the NHS surcharge, Starmer was on stronger ground, and his point about a care worker on the minimum wage having to work 70 hours to pay for this was a powerful one. Johnson\u2019s defence was glib, but it did not feel like a decisive exchange.</p> \n  <p>So Johnson got through this without the humbling he endured last week. But to do so, he had to make quite a specific promise. When he first said that a contact tracing scheme capable of tracking 10,000 contacts a day would be up and running by 1 June, he made a firm commitment. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/may/20/uk-coronavirus-live-school-rebellion-english-primaries-pmqs-covid-19-latest-news-updates?page=with:block-5ec515b98f0864e579f1461c#block-5ec515b98f0864e579f1461c\">12.38pm.) </a>Later in the exchanges he was a bit more conditional, telling Starmer:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>What he heard is that we have growing confidence that we will have a test, track and trace operation that will be world-beating and yes, it will be in place, it will be in place by June 1.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This morning Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, gave what may turn out to be a more realistic assessment (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/may/20/uk-coronavirus-live-school-rebellion-english-primaries-pmqs-covid-19-latest-news-updates?page=with:block-5ec4d0c48f08a1782fa7df81#block-5ec4d0c48f08a1782fa7df81\">7.48am)</a>, saying that although he hoped to see a contact tracing system in place by 1 June, \u201cit won\u2019t necessarily be as developed and full blown as we\u2019d like\u201d.

(See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/may/20/uk-coronavirus-live-school-rebellion-english-primaries-pmqs-covid-19-latest-news-updates?page=with:block-5ec4d5308f0886ce4f5d6d40#block-5ec4d5308f0886ce4f5d6d40\">8.06am.) </a>Buckland was speaking in particular in relation to testing, but the statement has a wider application; in recent days there has been increasing focus on the consequences of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/19/uk-coronavirus-live-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ec3d26c8f08a1782fa7d7c1#block-5ec3d26c8f08a1782fa7d7c1\">the government\u2019s decision to get elderly patients out of hospitals and into care homes to free up bed space.</a> Buckland\u2019s statement was not, in substance, very surprising \u2013 it has been obvious for some time that this is what has happening \u2013 but, given that most ministers find it near-impossible to admit anything that might look like a mistake, his candour was striking.</p> \n  <p>In an interview with Sky News a few minutes ago Prof Martin Green, chief executive of<strong> Care England</strong>, which represents care providers, welcomed what Buckland said. Green told the programme:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think it\u2019s very significant because it\u2019s probably the first time that we\u2019ve had an admission that there was a priority for the NHS. We knew that from the very start of the pandemic, and in fact part of that challenge was that the priority for the NHS led to things like the disruption of PPE supplies for care homes.</p> \n   <p>In many ways I can understand why the government prioritised the NHS. I can understand why they wanted to make sure there was enough capacity, because if the pandemic had gone in the way that it was projected to go there would have been a huge need for hospital beds.

She says the government has world-leading measures to combat extremism. There will be an independent review of the Prevent programme, she says.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Around 1,000 migrants are said to have arrived across the Channel since the lockdown. What are you doing about that?</em></p> \n  <p>Patel says she is doing a lot. Border Force officers and others are working night and day on this, she says.

The Home Office is working with Sage on this, she says. </p> \n  <p><em>Q: Would you be confident sending your child to primary school in June?</em></p> \n  <p>Patel says she would be. Children\u2019s education is vital, she says. She says this does not amount to rushing back to a full school day.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Should sanctions be taken against councils that don\u2019t cooperate?</em></p> \n  <p>No, says Patel. She says government and councils need to work together.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: What happens if a teacher does not turn up?</em></p> \n  <p>Patel says she has seen some teachers do heroic work keeping schools open for the children of key workers and for vulnerable children.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Should sentences be increased for people who cough at police officers, threatening them with coronavirus?</em></p> \n  <p>Patel says she is looking at that.

  "<p>The latest weekly job figures highlight just how damaging the coronavirus has been to tourism regions and also how even in the face of supposedly better news the situation remains dire.</p> <p>In these bizarre times, it is weird what can be seen as \u201cgood\u201d, as the news came with a media release stating \u201c<a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/6160.0.55.001Media%20Release1Week%20ending%202%20May%202020?opendocument&amp;tabname=Summary&amp;prodno=6160.0.55.001&amp;issue=Week%20ending%202%20May%202020&amp;num=&amp;view=\">slowdown in COVID-19 job losses</a>\u201d.

And sure, that is nowhere near the massive 3.7% drop that occurred in the first week in April. But it is still the biggest drop since then and is equivalent to some 120,000 people losing their jobs in just one week:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Weekly growth of jobs by age\">  <iframe title=\"Weekly growth of jobs by age\" aria-label=\"chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-tseVJ\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/tseVJ/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The slowing, such as it is, is also due mostly to a pick-up in jobs for those under 20. Every other age group \u2013 whether male or female \u2013 saw a greater loss of jobs in the first week of May than in the last week of April.</p> <p>So, yes, it is good that we are not losing jobs at the same speed we did when the shutdowns occurred (not surprising really) but, given that 2% of people in their 30s lost a job in the first week of May \u2013 only slightly down on the worst weekly fall of 2.85% \u2013 it might be a bit early to start relaxing.</p> <p>The increase in jobs for younger workers is likely to be linked to an increase in jobs in the accommodation and food services sector. This is mostly the result of a slight easing of restrictions and also just a bit of a rebound from an incredible drop.</p> <p>Accommodation and food, and the arts and recreation sectors were two of the industries that saw the best job growth in the first week of May but they are also the two which have suffered the biggest overall job losses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Job losses by industry\">  <iframe title=\"Job losses by industry\" aria-label=\"chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-ULX3E\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ULX3E/3/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Even with a 5% increase in jobs in the first week of May, there are still 27% fewer job in the accommodation and food services industry than was the case at the end of February.</p> <p>That more than one in four jobs in the industry have gone in a month remains utterly shattering to contemplate, and also explains why the job losses are so decidedly varied across the regions.</p> <p>In New South Wales, for example, the Blacktown region has seen the smallest drop in jobs \u2013 down 4% (still astonishingly large), and yet it pales in comparison to job losses on the tourist friendly mid-north coast, which has had nearly 12% of jobs disappear:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Biggest and smallest job losses by region in each state\">  <iframe title=\"Biggest and smallest job losses by region in each state\" aria-label=\"chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-wsrSy\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/wsrSy/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Across the country there is a clear sense that the areas that are suffering the most are those most dependent upon tourism \u2013 such as the Gold Coast (down 9%), the Sunshine Cost (down 10.2%) the SA Barossa region (down 9.6%) and Coffs Harbour-Grafton (down 11.2%):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Job losses 14 March to 18 April by region\">  <iframe title=\"Job losses 14 March to 18 April by region \" aria-label=\"Map\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-LxlbC\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/LxlbC/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The erratic level of job losses looks set to continue as we move from shutdown to soft reopenings.</p> <p>The latest preliminary <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/8501.0.55.008Main%20Features1Apr%202020?opendocument&amp;tabname=Summary&amp;prodno=8501.0.55.008&amp;issue=Apr%202020&amp;num=&amp;view=\">retail trade figures</a> highlight just how far we have to go before things get back to \u201cnormal\u201d.</p> <p>In March total <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/commentisfree/2020/may/10/a-rise-in-retail-sales-is-normally-good-news-but-this-is-not-normal-and-clearly-not-sustainable\">retail trade surged</a> a record 8.5% off the back of panic buying and stockpiling of home goods to use during the shutdown.</p> <p>But in April came the hangover of that splurge and it was a killer.

Yes, there may be shops open, but will there be people spending money in them? It is not enough to announce that the economy is open \u2013 the economy actually has to open \u2013 and given how dependent we are on exports, that means open internationally.</p> <p>Tourism looks set to suffer for a long time yet. Domestic travel will help, but as one who last year had booked a holiday to Queensland for July and is now in the process of trying to get refunds, it is clear the snapback is not going to be fast.</p> <p>Anecdotally, people do seem to be frequenting retail shops in good numbers since the easing of restrictions (at least from my experience in the Australian Capital Territory), but it is all dependent on there not being another spike in cases, which would see people isolate themselves quickly and the job losses fall sharply yet again.</p> <p>But that means easing the restrictions will need to be done slowly \u2013 and that, by extension, slows the ability for the economy to return to any type of pre-virus level.</p> <p>There are some OK-ish signs in the latest job figures, but only compared with the worst period of the past two months. By comparison with any \u201cnormal\u201d time, the first week of May saw an obscene number of job losses.</p> <p>We have a long way to go yet<a href=\"xhttps://www.theguardian.com/au\">.</a></p> <p>\u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia</p>",

Corene De La Cruz, a 41-year-old inmate, held a prison job assisting with transportation of other inmates, and without access to masks, gloves or other protections she was fearful of bringing Covid-19 back to her unit, according to Beatrice Bayardo, De La Cruz\u2019s mother.</p> <p>So De La Cruz and another co-worker took the limited bleach that was available to them in soda bottles, to wipe down some areas in the unit.</p> <p>When staff found out, officers tore up her cell searching for bottles, her mother said. The officers accused her of \u201ctheft of state property\u201d, classifying the \u201crules violation\u201d as a possible \u201cserious\u201d felony, records show.

Her daughter has described chaotic scenes as more of the facility has gone into lockdown: \u201cPeople have been screaming, let us out.\u201d</p> <p>The lockdowns mean Bayardo rarely hears from her daughter any more. On Mother\u2019s Day, De La Cruz was able to record a video for her family through the prison communication system. In it, it appears she has been crying: \u201cJust wanted to let you guys know that I love you guys, I miss you guys and there\u2019s never a day that passes that I don\u2019t think of you guys. I know times are hard right now, but just look around, look where I\u2019m at, it could be worse.\u201d</p> <p>Bayardo struggled to watch it, thinking, \u201cIs this the last time I\u2019m going to see her?\u201d</p> <p>Dana Simas, a California prisons spokesperson, said the disciplinary process against De La Cruz was ongoing and that CIW was providing \u201cextra cleaning supplies to allow them to keep their living area clean\u201d. She added, \u201cWe are not imposing disciplinary actions if those supplies were obtained properly.\u201d</p> <p>She said all CIW prisoners have access to healthcare services and medication and that staff make \u201cmultiple rounds daily\u201d and conduct screenings to identify people with new symptoms. Across state prisons, inmates and staff are now required to use reusable cloth masks, she said, adding that the allegation of threats for wearing masks was \u201chearsay\u201d.</p> <p>April Harris, the CIW inmate with coronavirus, said she wishes staff would provide medicine, or allow her to purchase vitamin C and cough drops from the commissary. She said she\u2019s even struggling to stay properly hydrated while battling the virus: \u201cThe water is coming out brown from our faucets.\u201d She gets one cup of ice a day, she said, and added that she hadn\u2019t seen daylight in days.</p> <p>The one bright moment since her positive test was when a nurse took her vitals and said a prayer for her: \u201cI felt human for a second.\u201d</p> <p>Eventually, her messages to the Guardian stopped coming.

Back in 2018, I was the first Tory candidate who made a public stance and stepped down because of Brexit. It was clear to me that Brexit means only one thing: a curtailment of our freedoms. The immigration bill confirms our fears that it presents Great Britain as a country that is ruled by self-righteousness, and that, to a large extent, people enjoy looking down on others. This even for the price of the curtailment of their own freedoms.</p> <p>A reasoned person would assume that we have learned in the Covid-19 crisis how much we depend on key workers and that we would appreciate them. Many of them are EU citizens. The bill says the opposite. In post-Brexit Britain, those key workers are seen as unskilled and as not worth having the right to live in Britain. I am deeply saddened. Let us all continue to fight for freedom and respect for everyone, here in London and all over the UK \u2013 the country that people across the world have long seen as the light of freedom, kindness and togetherness.<br><strong>Marx de Morais</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 There is something deeply wrong and unsettling about the government\u2019s immigration bill returning to the Commons.</p> <p>The bill implicitly suggests \u201clow-skilled\u201d workers \u2013 who earn below an arbitrary threshold \u2013 are unwanted, unnecessary and therefore somehow lesser. This view would always be reprehensible, but to seek to actualise this divisive law is particularly sinister. Care workers fall under the \u201cunskilled\u201d category; that the government wants far fewer foreign-born care workers to migrate here underlines just how rotten the administration is. It is unaware of the plight of care workers? Is it oblivious to how much good they provide? The current crisis has shown just how key \u201cunskilled\u201d workers are, yet the government still hasn\u2019t got the message. It beggars belief.<br><strong>Sebastian Monblat</strong><br><em>Sutton, London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Priti Patel has defended the immigration bill, which treats some NHS staff and social workers as low or unskilled workers. Her defence was that this was in line with the public\u2019s priorities of wishing to control immigration. Really?</p> <p>Has she missed the 8pm applause for NHS and social care workers, and other crucial low-income workers who have kept society safer? I presume the home secretary has been self-isolating from reality.<br><strong>Maurizio Moore</strong><br><em>Writtle, Essex</em></p>",

  "<p>A teenager has died following an attack by a water buffalo at a farm in Wales that also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/20/peru-coronavirus-lockdown-new-cases\">claimed the life of his father.</a></p> <p>Police confirmed on Wednesday that Peter Jump, 19, died following the incident on the farm near Usk in south-east Wales. Peter\u2019s father, Ralph \u201cJon\u201d Jump, 57, was pronounced dead at the scene on 5 May while his son was airlifted to hospital in Cardiff.</p> <p>The pair are believed to have been hurt as they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/06/man-killed-by-water-buffalo-in-wales-reared-animals-as-sideline-ralph-jon-jump-usk\">tried to return the buffalo to its pen</a>. Peter\u2019s sister, Isabel, suffered leg injuries.</p> <p>Jump, the managing director of a heating company, rented the farm to start a buffalo milk soap business with his family. They hand-reared the buffalo there.</p> <p>Tributes have been paid to the father and son. A family member said: \u201cI can only share from my own feelings also \u2013 the loss of my best friend Jonny and our wonderful Pete. It\u2019s really quite surreal and insurmountable at present.\u201d</p> <p>A friend said Ralph was \u201cgenerous of spirit and warm of heart\u201d.</p> <p>Police said they were continuing to investigate the incident. The teenager died on 6 May but the news of his death was only revealed on Wednesday.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Gwent police said: \u201cA 19-year-old man from the Gwehelog area was taken to the University Hospital for Wales by the Welsh air ambulance after sustaining critical injuries. He subsequently died in hospital. Gwent police has launched an investigation into this incident and it remains ongoing.\u201d</p> <p>Det Insp Amanda Venn said: \u201cOur thoughts remain with the family at this tragic time. The family have asked to be given time to grieve and we would ask that their privacy is respected. The force is also currently liaising with the Gwent coroner service in relation to this incident.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking shortly after the tragedy, a friend said: \u201cJon spent all his life in a shirt and tie but loved pulling on his wellies to get stuck in at the farm. He was as happy as anything there.\u201d</p> <p>The farm is the base of the Bufalina Soap Company, which makes a range of scented soap. The company says on its website: \u201cWe make our soap with the milk from our herd of Mediterranean water buffalo, located in the Welsh Marches.</p> <p>\u201cAround the world this buffalo breed is famous for its dairy products such as mozzarella, gelato and ice cream. The richness of the milk makes it ideal for making a creamy, luxurious and gentle soap.\u201d</p> <p>The buffalo was put down.</p>",
  "<p>We haven\u2019t seen much of Boris Johnson over the past week. In fact we haven\u2019t seen him at all; not even for a single Downing Street press conference. Far too much like hard work. He\u2019s even making the notoriously lazy David Cameron look industrious by comparison. And Dave wasn\u2019t prime minister during the worst global health crisis in 100 years.</p> \n<p>Now, though, things have become a little clearer. In between taking Dilyn for a walk in the park and avoiding changing his baby\u2019s nappies, Boris has been breaking the habit of a lifetime by actually doing some preparation. After two weeks of humiliation at the despatch box during prime minister\u2019s questions, Boris had been taking lessons in how not to appear like a total car crash in front of a top QC.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"82beeb58-e861-4575-90dd-2b879d1a3a65\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/uk-to-start-coronavirus-contact-tracing-again\">Contact tracing is one of the most basic planks of public health responses to a pandemic</a>&nbsp;like the coronavirus. It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was \u2013 and always will be \u2013 central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014-15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.</p>\n    <p>Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.</p>\n    <p>It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure \u2013 originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.</p>\n    <p>South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.</p>\n    <p>Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">World Health Organization</a>&nbsp;says it should be the \u201cbackbone of the response\u201d in every country.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\"><b>Sarah Boseley</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The message that Boris appeared to have been given was for him to be more himself. The downside to this, though, is that the real Boris is actually rather unpleasant. The popular, fun-loving image has only ever been a veneer. Deep down, Boris is needy and insecure. Character traits that he hates in himself and finds impossible to accept, so his first instinct when cornered is to lash out. So that was the Boris we got at this week\u2019s PMQs. Pugnacious, ungracious, blustering, and not totally coherent.</p> \n<p>For the extra Tory backbenchers who had been bussed in for the occasion \u2013 the party high command feel Boris performs best when there is a home audience \u2013 this was an undoubted improvement on what had gone before when only a surly incompetence had been on view. But it was still a long way short of what most people in the country would have wanted from their leader at such a time. Even when he is being himself, Boris just isn\u2019t that good when up against someone like Keir Starmer, who is used to building a case based on the evidence.</p> \n<p>The Labour leader began on care homes. How did the government square its insistence that it had \u201cthrown a protective ring around care homes\u201d with the evidence given to the health select committee by the chief executive of Care England that countless patients had been booted out of hospital without any testing for the coronavirus?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cAs he knows full well, er, the, er, dist \u2026 \u201d Boris began, struggling to complete a meaningful sentence. We never did get to find out what the \u201cdist\u201d was. His language was as much of a mess as his hair. But just as it seemed the prime minister was reverting to one of his other default settings of winging it, he glanced at his notes for a better line of attack.</p> \n<p>Aha, he said. No one had been released into care homes without a clinician signing them out. Here we got a first view of the government\u2019s defence in the coming public inquiry. The government had never intended the wrong people to be released from hospitals and if they had been, then it was all down to doctor error. In five years\u2019 time it will turn out that all the excess care home deaths were down to one doctor who has also conveniently died of the coronavirus, and nothing to do with any decisions the government had made.</p> \n<p>There were times during the following exchanges when Starmer appeared rather unsettled by this new bullish, sollipsistic Boris \u2013 it was the height of cheek to accuse Starmer of feigning ignorance, when the prime minister was so busy feigning intelligence. At one point Matt Hancock started joining in \u2013 \u201cand you bought your mum a \u00a310m donkey sanctuary, so there\u201d \u2013 before the Speaker invited him to either shut up or sod off. Matt slumped into a five-year-old\u2019s strop and stared angrily at the ground.</p> \n<p>Not that Boris appeared particularly grateful for the health secretary\u2019s intervention \u2013 he dislikes toadies as much as those who stand up to him \u2013 as he promptly threw him under a bus by insisting that the test and trace programme would be fully operational by 1 June. There was no word on whether Matt\u2019s App would also be up and running, but given that the government has missed almost every deadline it has set for itself \u2013 and lied about the ones it has met \u2013 no one was holding their breath. Boris had yet again set himself and his health secretary up to fail.</p> \n<p>Although Starmer wasn\u2019t getting things all his own way, there was no doubt he was still getting the better of every argument. There\u2019s something about the poise and command of the Labour leader that seems to get under the prime minister\u2019s skin. As if he knows that he will never come close to having his integrity or intellect. At one point Boris nearly lost it completely by demanding that Keir stop being so negative. How about some applause for the people who hadn\u2019t died?</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but 34,000 dead is negative,\u201d Starmer observed. Especially as the real figure was north of 50,000, many of which were totally avoidable.</p> \n<p>One could forgive a lot if Boris was even able to come close to an apology, but now he can\u2019t even admit that there is a correlation between an effective test-and-trace system and a further easing of lockdown measures. There again, he can\u2019t bring himself to say how many children he has, so what hope is there?</p> \n<p>It was with the last two questions that Starmer left Boris hopelessly exposed. How did the government justify <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/19/uk-government-urged-to-scrap-624-nhs-charge-for-migrant-care-workers-helping-combat-coronavirus\">the \u00a3624 visa surcharge on so many overseas workers</a> who had done so much to keep the NHS running more or less smoothly?</p> \n<p>Boris merely shrugged. They were a useful source of revenue. Besides, they were lucky to have a job in which some of them could say they had been able to save the life of the prime minister. Put that way, Luis and Jenny should have been thanking him for fleecing them for more cash rather than the other way round. Such is his narcissism, Boris had no idea how petty and spiteful he sounded.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The rest of PMQs was something of a non-event. Boris had clearly come prepared to see off Keir and only had bog-standard, drivel-strewn non-answers for everyone else. He left the chamber with a swagger. Before he had twice lost on a knockout; now he had just been comprehensively outclassed on points. And back in Downing Street, Classic Dom would be telling him that was another overwhelming victory.</p> \n<p><em>\u2022</em> This article was amended on 21 May 2020 to correct the figure for the NHS surcharge levied on migrant workers from outside the European Economic Area.</p>",

But it could set him on a collision course with Brussels, which had envisaged that customs controls would apply to all goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain, with rebates on tariffs for goods that did not go on to the Republic of Ireland.</p> \n<p>Sources say the government has come under pressure from big supermarket chains among other businesses who have argued that if they are delivering consignments to shoppers in Northern Ireland, a tariff-charge and charge-back arrangement would lead to costly and unnecessary paperwork.</p> \n<p>Gove promised the checks would involve \u201cthe minimum possible bureaucratic consequences for business and traders, particularly those carrying out their affairs entirely within the UK customs territory\u201d.</p> \n<p>The government has said, however, that \u201csome new administrative process\u201d will apply for traders because the deal requires the UK to apply EU customs rules to goods entering Northern Ireland. #</p> \n<p>The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, welcomed the plan, revealing discussions on agrifood had been \u201cdifficult and sensitive\u201d. But she warned the UK deal must ensure it \u201cdoes not saddle individual Northern Ireland businesses with further costly administrative burdens\u201d.</p> \n<p>Claire Hanna, the Social Democratic and Labour party MP for Belfast South, said Gove had \u201cfinally confirmed there will be a large increase in the amount of red tape\u201d for businesses and warned that \u201ccastles in the air\u201d such as trade deals with the US would lead to increased checks in the Irish Sea.</p> \n<p>Sinn F\u00e9in said the checks showed the \u201cforked tongue\u201d approach of the UK government.</p> \n<p>Discussing the papers in the Commons, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, Rachel Reeves, said: \u201cWe welcome the statement today but it does expose the broken promises made by the prime minister ... Even now, many fear that the government are not willing to admit the full extent of those. We have seven months to get this right and we must.\u201d</p> \n<p>Business leaders also gave the plan a cautious welcome. Seamus Leheny, the policy manager at the Freight Transport Association in Northern Ireland, said it was a \u201cpositive step that the UK confirms there will be some controls\u201d, but that the language was so \u201cloose\u201d in areas that it was effectively putting the ball back in the EU\u2019s court.</p> \n<p>Aodh\u00e1n Connolly, the director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said it was a good start but questions remained. \u201cThe UK government has acknowledged the need to deliver upon their obligations under the Northern Ireland protocol. This acceptance of the hurdles that need to be overcome is a good starting point, but there are still many questions that are left unanswered.\u201d</p> \n<p>An EU spokesman said the commission welcomed the proposal and would study it in detail.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have said we can provide certain flexibilities in terms of customs checks, but they have to fit with the union\u2019s customs code, because the Irish border is the EU border, so the union customs code applies,\u201d a second EU official said.</p> \n<p>The document emerged as the EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier warned the government that the next round of negotiations on the future relationship must bring \u201cnew dynamism in order to avoid a stalemate\u201d. He was responding to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/19/brexit-talks-eu-wants-us-to-obey-the-rules-of-their-club-says-gove\"> a letter from his UK counterpart David Frost</a> , who accused Brussels of treating the UK as an \u201cunworthy\u201d partner.</p> \n<p>Frost\u2019s letter went down badly in Brussels, where EU officials said it would have been better to save such conversations for the privacy of negotiations. In a pointed criticism made in his own reply - by letter - Barnier said an exchange of letters was \u201cnot necessarily the best way to discuss on substantial points\u201d.</p> \n<p>One EU diplomat said Frost\u2019s letter was \u201cpetulant\u201d and \u201cnot helpful\u201d, although added some of Barnier\u2019s comments were \u201cnot very helpful either\u201d, referring to Barnier\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/15/negotiators-gloomy-as-eu-uk-brexit-talks-end-in-stalemate\">recent remarks </a>where he accused the UK of not engaging in the talks. \u201cWe would agree with [Barnier] in substance but we don\u2019t necessarily think that the tone of these comments has been very helpful,\u201d the diplomat said. </p> \n<p><br></p>",

  "<h2>The album to start with</h2> <p><strong>Blue (1971)</strong></p> <p>By the time Joni Mitchell released Blue in 1971, she had survived polio, a divorce, put her baby up for adoption, fended off another marriage proposal (from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/30/graham-nash-the-queen-stunned-me-by-asking-about-the-hollies\">Graham Nash</a>), and watched as one of her songs, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L1UngfqojI\">Both Sides Now</a>, became a massive hit for someone else.

I felt like a cellophane wrapper on a pack of cigarettes. I felt like I had absolutely no secrets from the world and I couldn\u2019t pretend in my life to be strong. Or to be happy. But the advantage of it in the music was that there were no defences there either.\u201d</p> <p>There is not one single track on this album that is not magnificent. And it was an audacious record in many ways. The emotional life of a young woman had never been put to tape so nakedly and so unapologetically \u2013 from the wretchedness of giving up a child (Little Green), the mocking of men who laugh at the follies of young women who want \u201croses and kisses and pretty men to tell you all those pretty lies\u201d and end up a wife with a coffee percolator (The Last Time I Saw Richard), and trying to find emancipation in love affairs (\u201cI love you when I forget about me\u201d, on All I Want).</p> <p>The music is as bold as its subject matter. Her hands damaged with polio, she made up her own guitar tunings. Her soprano, borrowing often from jazz phrasing, is thrillingly alive; there is no resolution with a neat pop harmony. Listen, and you have your own secret desires articulated.</p> <p>The characters within the songs are vivid and complex. Take <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEWE4J7ZTyc\">A Case of You</a>, a love song written in the past tense, a dialogue with her former lover Leonard Cohen. It opens with the line stolen from Cohen, who was quoting Julius Caesar at her. He was mad she had used their private conversation in song. \u201cLife is fair game\u201d for lyrics, she said. She drinks up a lover in full, and emerges from the relationship clear-headed, still standing.</p> <p>The weight of the public consumption of her inner life, and those of the other singer-songwriters from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/12/crosby-stills-nash\">the Laurel Canyon scene</a>, would be hard for her to bear at times. But in spearheading music that looked towards the emotional life of its makers, she created an enduring bond with her listeners.</p> <h2>The three albums to listen to next</h2> <p><strong>For the Roses (1972)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YVroYzNz60\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8YVroYzNz60?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Joni Mitchell: You Turn Me On, I\u2019m a Radio \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>After the exposure of those cellophane years, Mitchell sought retreat. She went back home to Canada, and bought a tiny stone house \u201clike a monastery\u201d on British Columbia\u2019s Sunshine Coast where she could hide from it all. There was no electricity; by night she lived by candlelight. By day, she bathed under the old trees, in the waterfalls, on the pebble beaches. She wrote an album about salvation, about finding oneself again in the silence after the applause has finished.</p> <p>Judgement of the Moon and Stars is her grand tribute to Beethoven, about whom she read a book in her isolation. She felt kinship with him \u2013 rejected by the court, too wild for the refined world in which he was forced to play. Mitchell was fully aware of her own genius \u2013 the critics would never compare her to the great masters, so she did it herself.</p> <p>Her voice on this album rings with clarity. Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire is a devastating account of her relationship with James Taylor, her torment at watching him succumb to the \u201cshadow of lady release\u201d, or heroin. There are no holds barred \u2013 the sink is splattered with blood, the protagonist \u201cbashes in veins for peace\u201d. We so often look to the Velvet Underground\u2019s Heroin or Neil Young\u2019s The Needle and the Damage Done as cultural documents of the desolation and helplessness of opiate addiction, but Mitchell\u2019s despair is incomparable in its precision.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YVroYzNz60\">You Turn Me on, I\u2019m a Radio</a> was Mitchell\u2019s cheeky response when her new record label boss, David Geffen, asked her to write a hit (which it was). But the rest of the album is harder, more exhausting than Blue. Perhaps that is something to do with the glorious, golden timbre of her voice. A Woman of Heart and Mind vibrates with these chestier, lower tones she adopts. She is confrontational on this song, her equivalent perhaps of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/dec/05/100-best-nonfiction-books-no-45-a-room-of-ones-own-by-virginia-woolf-shakespeares-sister-seton-beton\">Virginia Wolf\u2019s A Room of One\u2019s Own</a> in its manifesto-like defiance to protect her own freedom.</p> <p>The song Lesson in Survival could well have been the title of the album \u2013 one that deals with the capacity of the natural world to heal and rebuild, the benefits of solitude, stillness and isolation on the psyche. Never has this been more prescient than now.</p> <p><strong>Court and Spark (1974)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW_IS-DPZ1E\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xW_IS-DPZ1E?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Joni Mitchell: Free Man in Paris \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>After the releases of For the Roses, Geffen \u2013 who by this point had acquired a Hollywood mansion \u2013 lured her back to stay with him (and Cher, who he was living with at the time). She had gone in search of meaning and came back to the glitz and pomp and bright lights of the Los Angeles party scene. This would become her muse: a human circus of hot messes. And while she writes as one of them, she is still a Canadian prairie girl at heart. This tension is the core of this record, and it is also, <a href=\"https://thequietus.com/articles/20034-brian-eno-favourite-records-interview?page=14\">as Brian Eno has pointed out</a>, a pop album that deals not with the complexities of adolescence but adulthood.</p> <p>There are familiar themes though: sexual liberation, such as on <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/2akjxkzFolkeV72Yyv5KrM?highlight=spotify:track:0tVzXGFyNPusa1VkHmYDLd\">Help Me</a>, a gorgeous, lilting, jazz ballad said to be about her dalliance with Warren Beatty (Prince would quote it years later on the lusty groove of The Ballad of Dorothy Parker). Free Man in Paris, inspired by a trip she took with Geffen, is a song, in Mitchell\u2019s words, about the unequivocal joy of feeling \u201cunfettered and alive\u201d. Geffen at the time was 20 years away from publicly coming out, and he begged her not to put it on the album for fear of the protagonist looking for \u201cthat very good friend of mine\u201d would out him. But the song stayed, and it lives on as a testament to the lightness of being that comes with expressing one\u2019s sexual self.</p> <p>People\u2019s Parties, meanwhile, is such a shrewd dismantling of the myth of celebrity that the lyrics read like a news dispatch from a far-flung country, except she is at a party in the Hollywood hills. \u201cSome are friendly,\u201d she writes of her fellow guests. \u201cSome are cutting, some are watching it from the wings. Some are standing in the centre, giving to get something.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Hejira (1976)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4KBohkaHDE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/i4KBohkaHDE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Joni Mitchell: Coyote \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Of all the things her fans have said to her over the years, it was a young woman who turned to her once backstage at the Grammys and said: \u201cGirl, you make me see pictures in my head\u201d that thrilled her the most. Hejira, in that respect, is a cinema screen in Technicolor.</p> <p>By March 1976, Mitchell was enveloped by a cocaine addiction, cancelled a tour, and left LA with an ex lover and a potential new lover to drive to Maine, deviating via the deep south. The opening track, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4KBohkaHDE\">Coyote</a>, tremors with the thrill of such a journey, the pulsating of the light and dark of the freeway. We meet the album\u2019s characters: the lovers, the \u201ccoyotes\u201d who she picks up dancing in bars, who \u201cpicks up my scent on his fingers\u201d the next morning \u201cwhile he\u2019s watching the waitresses\u2019 legs\u201d in some diner. There is no shame in it. \u201cNo regrets, coyote,\u201d is the first line of the album.</p> <p>Hejira is about fight and flight. She is here, ostensibly, \u201cwrestling with my ego\u201d, trying to let go of the self-absorption that comes with cocaine. Never is this more present than in Song for Sharon, in which she dedicates a verse to the suicide of Phyllis Major, the wife of Mitchell\u2019s former lover <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/jackson-browne\">Jackson Browne</a>, with whom she had a stormy relationship. The grief was for the sisterhood; she blamed herself for not warning the women who came after her. \u201cIt seems we all live so close to that line, and so far from satisfaction,\u201d she sang.</p> <p>Casual encounters, with their fleeting moments of ecstasy and liberation, offered no less. \u201cThere\u2019s no comprehending, just how close to the bone and the skin and the eyes and the lips you can get and still feel so alone,\u201d she sings, on Coyote again. It is not self-pitying, but a realist\u2019s account of wanting human touch without attachment, and the inevitable consequences.</p> <p>Mitchell\u2019s vulnerability is not the gentle, fragile kind that women are expected to display \u2013 it is at times annihilating. She demands the freedoms afforded to men to be left alone to do whatever they want, but Refuge of the Roads seems to laugh all this off. Keep moving, keep growing, it says: \u201cWe laughed how our perfection, would always be denied.\u201d</p> <h2>One for the heads</h2> <p><strong>Mingus (1979)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpsrBWOOv9U\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QpsrBWOOv9U?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Joni Mitchell: The Wolf That Lives in Lindsey \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/sep/03/charles-mingus-black-saint\">Charles Mingus</a> was one of the most lauded bassists and bandleaders in jazz, playing behind Charlie Parker, Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong. He was explosive, at times violent, a \u201cbad boy offstage\u201d but \u201cpure as could be onstage\u201d as Mitchell would describe him. Mingus would chastise players for falsifying emotion \u2013 \u201cmost people can\u2019t hear that, the phony note,\u201d she told her biographer David Yaffe \u2013 but he liked Mitchell for her purity of spirit and lack of guile.</p> <p>By the time they worked together, Mingus had been diagnosed with Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease and was terminally ill. He died before the project could be completed. \u201cCharles Mingus, a musical mystic, died in Mexico, January 5, 1979 at the age of 56. He was cremated the next day. That same day 56 sperm whales beached themselves on the Mexican coastline and were removed by fire. These are the coincidences that thrill my imagination,\u201d she wrote in the sleevenotes.</p> <p>While she had never put her voice to someone else\u2019s music before, the album is all the more thrilling because of it \u2013 it howls with this collision of euphoria and dissonance. Her voice, in part due to the steady stream of cigarettes she smoked, is deeper than the flighty soprano of her younger years, rich and world-worn. She is facing her own mortality as Mingus grapples with his.</p> <p>Instinct drives this album much like the rest of Mitchell\u2019s career. An easy path for her could well have been to write album after album of Blues and Court and Sparks, but she would never have found satisfaction. Her endurance has been down to her own strong will \u2013 never has she settled into taking the advice of others. That is true resilience, a rare freedom of spirit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2019/oct/22/turbulent-indigos-glorious-joni-mitchell-watercolours-in-pictures\">Turbulent indigos: glorious Joni Mitchell watercolours \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>The primer playlist</h2> <p>For Spotify users, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0GFWc66F0Wf1sdyAbzbAz6\">click here</a> or see below.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"spotify playlist\">  <iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/0GFWc66F0Wf1sdyAbzbAz6\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2>Further reading</h2> <p><strong>Reckless Daughter by David Yaffe <br></strong>A comprehensive, meticulously researched biography featuring many interviews over the years with Mitchell herself and her collaborators.

I do accept and I do understand the difficulties faced by our amazing NHS staff. I\u2019ve been the personal beneficiary of carers who come from abroad and, frankly, saved my life \u2026 so I know exactly the importance.</p> \n<p>\u201cOn the other hand we must look at the realities. This is a great national service, it\u2019s a national institution.

Prof John Ashton, a former regional director of </em><em>public </em><em>health and regional medical officer for the </em><em>north-west of England, describes his experience of contact tracing at the early stages of the </em><em>coronavirus crisis and highlights pitfalls the UK should avoid.</em></p> \n<p>\u201cIn early February I was invited to Bahrain to examine the country\u2019s preparedness for Covid-19. The first case, that of a religious pilgrim returning from a visit to holy sites in Iran, was diagnosed while I was in Bahrain on 24 February.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"82beeb58-e861-4575-90dd-2b879d1a3a65\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/uk-to-start-coronavirus-contact-tracing-again\">Contact tracing is one of the most basic planks of public health responses to a pandemic</a>&nbsp;like the coronavirus. It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was \u2013 and always will be \u2013 central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014-15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.</p>\n    <p>Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.</p>\n    <p>It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure \u2013 originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.</p>\n    <p>South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.</p>\n    <p>Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">World Health Organization</a>&nbsp;says it should be the \u201cbackbone of the response\u201d in every country.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\"><b>Sarah Boseley</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe first thing I asked for was a tour around the island state to visit key places where the virus might make an entry: air and sea ports, the road causeway with its heavily used link to Saudi Arabia, the main prison, public health laboratories and each of the hospital estates, as well as housing projects for migrant workers.</p> \n<p>\u201cTogether with members of the Covid task force that had been set up in early February, I spoke to all those in leadership positions to seek out weaknesses in the chain of epidemic control and to assess the capacity for an effective public health response.</p> \n<p>\u201cAmong other things, we were exploring forensically for weak spots where the virus could get hold, replicate and spread. At this early stage we were able to identify that a lack of testing capacity was an issue, and in mid-February I was able to advise the crown prince, Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa, and the Supreme Health Council to urgently order more supplies and equipment, a recommendation that was immediately acted on.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe result is that although Bahrain has a population of under 2 million, the Bahrainis are doing far more testing now per head of population than say, Wales, which has double its population. In practical terms, at Bahrain airport, where screening and triaging of all arriving passengers has been in place for three months, up to 1,000 passengers coming from affected parts of the world, or who might be manifesting early symptoms of infection, have been routinely tested for coronavirus.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis has been followed up by a systematic approach to isolation, quarantine, contact tracing and treatment with a large measure of success. As of last week 6,000 tests were being carried out daily with 4,000 cases of diagnosed infection; at that time there had only been eight deaths.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWith the Bahrain situation in mind together with my own long experience of public health in England, I see several pitfalls ahead for the contact-tracing system in Britain unless things are put right urgently. One problem for instance is the use of test kits sent through the postal service. It should be remembered that the swabs needed to be taken from a person\u2019s nose and throat are quite invasive. Mistakes can be made and there is the risk that an inadequate sample is taken, resulting in a false negative report. </p> \n<p>\u201cAnother potential problem in the current recruitment system for contact-tracing staff is the lack of local knowledge. Ideally the national contact-tracing system should be decentralised and put into the hands of local public health specialists, who know their populations and are able to fully engage with them.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cMy fear is that we recruit an army of people working in call centres who are hundreds of miles from an area they are dealing with. There are thousands of experienced environmental health officers together with currently furloughed local government civil servants out there who could be recruited into the call pool who have the detailed knowledge to engage with their local communities and ensure a high-quality test, track and trace service.\u201d</p>",

  "<h2><strong>Bryan Mbeumo, age 20, Brentford</strong></h2> <p>The latest Brentford player to make a seamless transition from Ligue 2 to the English second tier, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2019/dec/18/french-market-trips-can-propel-franks-brentford-to-new-heights\">following a path</a> trodden by Sa\u00efd Benrahma and Neal Maupay after a club-record \u00a35.5m move from Troyes last summer. Benrahma and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/05/brentford-ollie-watkins\">Ollie Watkins</a>, who has been reborn as a No 9, have stolen the headlines but Mbeumo has been remarkably consistent in his debut season in the Championship, contributing 14 goals and six assists and, in some quarters, is considered to possess the most potential. Another Brentford forward, Marcus Forss, proved prolific on loan at AFC Wimbledon, scoring 11 goals in 19 appearances before a hamstring injury curtailed his progress in January.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/20/harrogate-league-two-national-league-anxious-wait-promotion-football-league\">Harrogate's dream of League Two on a knife edge \u2013 along with building plans | Andy Hunter</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Ilias Chair, 22, Queens Park Rangers</strong></h2> <p>Brentford\u2019s \u201cBMW\u201d of Benrahma, Mbeumo and Watkins have made a big impression but so have QPR\u2019s three-pronged attack, with Chair impressing in between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2018/nov/14/eberechi-eze-qpr-championship-football-league-blog\">Eberechi Eze</a> and Bright Osayi-Samuel behind, more often than not, a lone striker. Eze earned his stripes on loan at then League Two Wycombe and Chair added further vim to the first team, scoring five goals in 36 appearances following a fruitful six months at Stevenage last year. Chair was born in Antwerp but is of Moroccan descent, prompting inevitable comparisons to the former Loftus Road favourite Adel Taarabt and, though he is only 5ft 2in, the livewire No 10 packs a punch.</p> <h2><strong>Max Bird, 19, Derby</strong></h2> <p>Phillip Cocu has been spoilt for choice when it comes to academy talent \u2013Jason Knight and, more recently, Louie Sibley have made a splash \u2013 but Bird\u2019s progress has been striking, with Wayne Rooney recently underlining the teenager\u2019s growing importance. \u201cHe\u2019s probably the first name on the team sheet,\u201d said Rooney, adding the midfielder should be on the lips of coaches at St George\u2019s Park. \u201cI\u2019d push to say in the next year he could get an England place \u2013 I think he\u2019s been that good.\u201d Bird trained regularly with the first team under Frank Lampard last season and has enjoyed a run of games since Christmas. Last May he was named the EFL apprentice of the year, an award given to Ryan Sessegnon and Lewis Cook in recent seasons.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7af5bb101c7104a7bc6c2d6a72c328e7f2f69839\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7af5bb101c7104a7bc6c2d6a72c328e7f2f69839/0_68_3700_2365/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Max Bird (right) in action for Derby against Fulham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"639\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Max Bird (right) in action for Derby against Fulham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Hobley/News Images/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Ben White, 22, Leeds</strong></h2> <p>The ice-cool centre-back has barely put a foot wrong this season, playing every minute of every Championship game to help Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s side to top spot. The Brighton loanee excelled in League Two and One at Newport and Peterborough respectively and, after replacing Pontus Jansson at Leeds, he has again relished the jump in standard. White, who was released by Southampton at 16, has been a big hit \u2013 last month a five-year-old Leeds fan offered Brighton \u00a315.07 for the defender \u2013 and his progress has interested Premier League sides. White is a slick operator, composed but mean in the tackle and everything suggests he will take the next step in his stride, too.</p> <h2><strong>Conor Chaplin, 23, Barnsley</strong></h2> <p>With almost 200 games under his belt, Chaplin is not a new kid on the block but the striker has savoured his first taste of the Championship, hitting double figures for the league\u2019s bottom club. Chaplin had doubts over whether he could perform in the second tier but has thrived since Gerhard Struber\u2019s appointment in November; his tally of 12 goals in all competitions is a career best. The 5ft 7in forward burst on to the scene at boyhood club Portsmouth and came close to leaving for Oakwell two years ago before signing for Coventry, only for Barnsley to again come calling last summer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2602f7979b2960f80ba15ea46161a84d7cad44b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2602f7979b2960f80ba15ea46161a84d7cad44b/0_62_3904_2344/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barnsley\u2019s Conor Chaplin (right) has thrived in his first Championship season.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barnsley\u2019s Conor Chaplin (right) has thrived in his first Championship season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greig Cowie/BPI/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Jude Bellingham, 16, Birmingham</strong></h2> <p>The most obvious name on this list, Bellingham has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2020/feb/20/jude-bellingham-on-the-radar-of-footballs-powerhouses-birmingham-city-midfielder-aged-16\">taken the Championship by storm</a>, with Manchester United and Borussia Dortmund among his biggest admirers. At 14 he was dictating games for Birmingham\u2019s under-18s; at 15 starring for the under-23s; and at 16 years and 38 days he made his first-team debut before, a week later, scoring the winner on his first league start. Technically a first-year scholar on \u00a3145 a week, he plays with a maturity that belies his years. Though he has thrived on the left flank, his exuberance shines through as a box-to-box midfielder in the position those closest to him feel he will spend his career.</p> <h2><strong>Liam Walsh, 22, Coventry</strong></h2> <p>His teammates have nicknamed him Messi, which says a lot about the impact Walsh has made on loan from Bristol City, whose manager, Lee Johnson, said the former Everton youngster needed \u201c40 games on the spin\u201d to become Championship-ready. Together with another Bristol City player, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/15/wales-joe-morrell-ive-watched-every-verratti-video-on-youtube\">Joe Morrell</a>, who has spent the season on loan at Lincoln, Walsh has been one of League One\u2019s standout performers. In November a wonderful solo strike whereby Walsh drove from halfway before fooling three Rochdale defenders and thumping the ball into the top corner had staff purring and the tenacious midfielder\u2019s form has been central to helping Coventry surge to top spot.</p> <h2><strong>Sam McCallum, 19, Coventry</strong></h2> <p>Two years ago the left-back was playing for eighth-tier Herne Bay but, via a week at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/27/jamie-vardy-leicester-academy-non-league\">Jamie Vardy\u2019s V9 academy camp</a>, McCallum is now on Norwich\u2019s books after a breakout season in League One. \u201cIt\u2019s this sort of story that it was set up for,\u201d Vardy said. The defender was released by Gillingham at 15 and has worked tirelessly since seizing his second chance. His athleticism, attitude and technique have impressed Coventry\u2019s coaching staff. In January he joined Norwich\u2019s stable of young talent for an initial \u00a32.5m before being loaned back to Coventry.</p> <h2><strong>Randell Williams, 23, Exeter</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c7961d5afaecaac9c2e15f85bed4e6e5a21ab86b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7961d5afaecaac9c2e15f85bed4e6e5a21ab86b/1128_219_3234_3383/956.jpg\" alt=\"Exeter\u2019s Randell Williams\" width=\"956\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Exeter\u2019s Randell Williams is second only to Kevin De Bruyne for assists across the four tiers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harry Trump/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Exeter are renowned for developing players and they appear to have polished a rough diamond in Williams, who has 14 assists this season \u2013 only Kevin De Bruyne has more across the top four tiers. The electric winger, who has shone at wing-back, spent time at Tottenham as a youngster and was picked up by Watford after his release by Crystal Palace, but was allowed to depart on a free in January last year. Williams started his career at Tower Hamlets, playing senior football at the age of 15, but more recently helped Wycombe into League One. \u201cHe has a great spring, pace and his standards are unbelievably high,\u201d said the Wycombe manager, Gareth Ainsworth.</p> <h2><strong>Ebou Adams, 24, Forest Green Rovers</strong></h2> <p>An athletic midfielder who shrugs off tackles \u2013 he is the most-fouled player in League Two \u2013 Adams is another player who has worked his way back into the Football League via non-league. The Gambia international grew up in south-east London and joined Norwich from Dartford in 2016 but was released after loan spells at Shrewsbury, for whom he played five matches in League One, and Leyton Orient. Adams signed from Ebbsfleet last summer and has been a major boon in a disappointing season for Forest Green. \u201cWe love him,\u201d said the club\u2019s owner, Dale Vince. \u201cHe is so strong and a fundamental part of our team.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Silence in a book is a funny old thing. Too much of it and the reader may well want their money back. Too little and what\u2019s left of suspense, mystery, drama? In literature as in life, there is much to learn from what is left unsaid.</p> <p>For writers, silence is a gift. Whether it comes in the form of characters confined to silence or those committed to muting voices that are deemed dangerously other, there are few authors who haven\u2019t at some point grappled with the question of how best to represent, well, nothing.</p> <p>I have long been fascinated by silence. As noisy child and adolescent, I experienced a fair few arched eyebrows when I decided to write my undergraduate dissertation on ellipsis in modernist literature. Fast forward four years to when I started writing fiction and the subject of silence was still at the forefront of my mind, specifically the sort that can settle at the centre of a long-term relationship.</p> <p>In my novel, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-silent-treatment-9781529123944.html\">The Silent Treatment</a><em>, </em>Frank and Maggie have been married for 40 years but they haven\u2019t spoken for the last six months. It is at once an uplifting love story and a mystery, an emotional drama and a meditation on trauma in a family. The further I explored the subject of silence in my characters\u2019 lives, the more I learned that it is a compound of nuances that mean something different to everyone. Silence can be both terrifying and calming, at once isolating and communicative in its own way, depending on who is expressing it.</p> <p>If I were to identify one unifying feature in the books listed below, it would be the way in which readers themselves are made to work harder when confronted with an impenetrable quiet. After all, it could be saying anything \u2026</p> <p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/titus-andronicus-9780141396323.html\">Titus Andronicus by William Shakespeare</a><br></strong>After being brutally raped, Titus\u2019s daughter, Lavinia, also has her tongue pulled out and her hands cut off to stop her reporting who is responsible for the attack. Incapacitated and robbed of her precious chastity, Lavinia\u2019s powerlessness becomes a potent symbol of the silencing of abused women.</p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-silence-of-the-girls-9780241983201.html\">The Silence of the Girls by Pat Barker</a><br></strong>Barker retells the Iliad primarily from the perspective of Briseis, the woman awarded as a prize to Achilles after the ransacking of Lyrnessus. With the narrative in her hands, there is nowhere to hide from the misogyny of ancient Greece. Ajax may be convinced that \u201csilence becomes a woman\u201d, but it is through Barker\u2019s reclaiming of the voices muted by history that we realise just how much modern resonance these classical stories hold in the #MeToo era.</p> <p><strong>3. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/a-quiet-kind-of-thunder-9781509810987.html\">A Quiet Kind of Thunder by Sara Barnard</a><br></strong>When Steffi, a selective mute, meets Rhys, a deaf pupil at her school, their worlds begin to open up. For Steffi, the prospect of speech is riddled with anxiety and Barnard provides a sensitive exploration of the issue for a young adult audience. Steffi and Rhys communicate in part through BSL, a fascinating entry point into deaf culture. As their friendship quietly builds in something more, will Steffi find her voice and the courage to use it, again?</p> <p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-heart-is-a-lonely-hunter-9780141185224.html\">The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter by Carson McCullers</a><br></strong>John Singer starts the novel as one of two mutes in a small, Georgia mill town. When his best friend George is taken to a mental institution, John becomes isolated. Until, that is, he begins to take his meals in a local cafe and establishes himself as the silent confidant for the various people who frequent it. A beautiful exploration of conversation, its difficulties and the often-mystical search for understanding.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b0899c2e7bbbd5b5c696ac059f3f1244abf5c4a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0899c2e7bbbd5b5c696ac059f3f1244abf5c4a9/1433_0_1409_1824/772.jpg\" alt=\"Isabel Allende in 1985.\" width=\"772\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Isabel Allende in 1985.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felipe Amilibia/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>5. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-house-of-the-spirits-9780099528562.html\">The House of Spirits by Isabel Allende</a><br></strong>Following the lives of three generations of the Trueba family, this novel is marked by the decision of matriarch Clara to fall silent for nine years after the death of her older sister. In place of speech, Clara turns to writing, art and her spiritual powers as alternative means to connect with the world around her. This is suitably beguiling proof that shouting the loudest isn\u2019t always the best way to be heard.</p> <p><strong>6. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-girl-who-smiled-beads-9781786090508.html\">The Girl Who Smiled Beads by Clemantine Wamariya and Elizabeth Weil</a><br></strong>In this memoir, we follow Wamariya\u2019s journey from the Rwandan massacre in 1994 through the six years she and her sister spent displaced in seven African countries, until they are eventually granted refugee status in the US. As she reflects on her trauma, Wamariya struggles with the inability of language to do justice to her lived experience. It is impossible to forget the passage where she explores why \u201cgenocide\u201d fails to capture the full scope of an atrocity: \u201cYou cannot bear witness with a single word.\u201d</p> <p><strong>7. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/may/15/dorothy-m-richardson-deserves-recognition-finally-receiving\">Pilgrimage by Dorothy Richardson</a><br></strong>This little-known novel follows Miriam Henderson across 13 volumes (or \u201cnovel-chapters\u201d as Richardson wanted them to be known), following her quotidian life as a young working woman in early 20th-century London. The text is characterised by a high quantity of ellipses (\u2018\u2026\u2019) as Richardson plays into a wider modernist fascination with absence and its representation. A long read, but one that more than rewards the effort and, in the process, sheds light on the silence that lies at the heart of consciousness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"da5d574ed9aa4d2cc4cda7d3d707134a6ff694cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da5d574ed9aa4d2cc4cda7d3d707134a6ff694cb/0_0_1840_2800/657.jpg\" alt=\"Saoirse Ronan as Briony Tallis in the 2008 film version of Atonement.\" width=\"657\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saoirse Ronan as Briony Tallis in the 2008 film version of Atonement.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Entertainment Pictures/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>8. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/atonement-9781841593609.html\">Atonement by Ian McEwan</a><br></strong>To keep shtum, or not to keep shtum \u2013 that\u2019s one of the big questions in play in this Booker prize-shortlisted novel. From Paul and Lola\u2019s silence over Robbie\u2019s wrongful imprisonment to Briony\u2019s attempt at repentance through voicing her version of the truth, it\u2019s a story that shows just how compelling silence can be as a narrative device.</p> <p><strong>9. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-masterclasses/2020/feb/27/how-to-be-nature-writer-amy-liptrot\">The Outrun by Amy Liptrot</a></strong><br>At 30, Liptrot moves from London to Orkney, the site of her childhood, as she comes to terms with the alcoholism that characterised her 20s. In the dichotomy between city and island life, urban noise and wild silence, it\u2019s a stunning meditation on the restorative power of nature and its power to heal.</p> <p><strong>10. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/23/the-power-of-silence-in-the-smartphone-age\">Silence: In the Age of Noise by Erling Kagge</a><br></strong>As an adventurer, Kagge was the first person to complete the \u201cthree poles challenge\u201d, reaching the north pole, south pole and the summit of Everest. Rest assured, he isn\u2019t encouraging a trip to any/all of the three in a quest to find silence in the modern world. Rather, Kagge advocates finding pockets of quiet throughout everyday life \u2013 whether that\u2019s on the walk to work, in the shower, or taking a moment of stillness over a sandwich during lunchbreak.</p> <ul> <li><p>The Silent Treatment by Abbie Greaves is published by Century.

has just put out this statement on WA\u2019s hard closed border.</p> \n  <p>He says no change until other states get their numbers down:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>With continued Covid-19 outbreaks in several jurisdictions, including 24 cases in the last 3 days across 2 jurisdictions, the risk of introduction across an interstate border remains. The current quarantine restrictions ensure that such cases are isolated and unable to spread the disease further within the community. </p> \n   <p>While AHPPC provided no specific advice on interstate borders, closure has been an effective mechanism in reducing the introduction of disease in several jurisdictions, including South Australia, Queensland and Northern Territory. </p> \n   <p>As Western Australia increases the size of mass gatherings in the hospitality, community and sports sectors in Phases 2 and 3, the re-introduction of Covid-19 back into the community from travellers could lead to substantial outbreaks that may require either delay in easing of further restrictions or re-introduction of social distancing and mass gathering measures.</p> \n   <p>Until community spread is eliminated in the affected jurisdictions, which will require at least a month to confirm (two 14-day incubation periods), opening of the interstate borders is not recommended. If the community spread is controlled, relaxation of the interstate borders could be considered after the introduction and assessment of the impact of Phase 4.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T07:58:57.360Z\">at 8.58am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec4d32f8f08a1782fa7df97\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T07:25:12.923Z\">8.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Anaesthetists will have access to telehealth to do pre-operative consultations, the Australian Society of Anaesthetists said. </p> \n  <p>The expansion is a \u201cmajor win,\u201d ASA president <strong>Dr Suzi Nou</strong> said, and will \u201censure anaesthetists can identify patient factors that could significantly increase the risk for complications\u201d.

China, along with other parties, has actively participated in the consultations on the draft resolution and the co-sponsoring of the draft resolution.</p> \n  <p>Second, the above-mentioned draft resolution is entirely different from what the Australia called \u201cindependent international review\u201d. For example, the draft resolution proposes to initiate at the appropriate moment an evaluation rather than to launch an \u201cindependent international review\u201d instantly, which confirms WHO\u2019s leading role instead of adopting another mechanism. The draft resolution calls for an evaluation of experience gained and lessons learnt from the WHO-coordinated international health response, rather than an inquiry based on the presumption of guilt targeting certain country. We hope Australia will read the text carefully instead of making conclusions based on assumptions.</p> \n  <p>Lastly, I want to stress that we welcome it if Australia changes its course, completely gives up its political manoeuvere and returns to the broad consensus of the international community following the relevant WHA resolution.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T02:44:10.234Z\">at 3.44am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec494eb8f08a1782fa7de65\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T02:28:04.951Z\">3.28am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Beijing calls on Australia to 'completely give up its political manoeuvre'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry has responded to theWorld Health Assembly motion (which was led by the EU) and recommended Australia \u2018changes its course\u2019.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The spokesperson highlighted the differences between the WHA resolution and Australia\u2019s proposal of an independent international review <strong>and stressed that China welcomes it if Australia changes its course, completely gives up its political </strong><strong>manoeuvre</strong><strong> and returns to the broad consensus of the international community following the relevant WHA resolution.</strong></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T02:39:46.283Z\">at 3.39am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec494a38f0864e579f141fb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T02:23:54.889Z\">3.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Covid crisis, and the trade situation, has resulted in this announcement from the government:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Following broad industry consultation and further consideration of the impacts on industry, the Australian government has made the decision not to proceed with the Onshore Biosecurity Levy. </p> \n   <p>The department undertook a co-design process with industry to develop a levy model that was practical for industry and the government. </p> \n   <p>This process highlighted that a levy could not be implemented without significant regulatory impacts on industry and proposed levy payers. </p> \n   <p>This decision has also been made in consideration of the ongoing impacts of drought, bushfires and Covid-19 on the Australian economy and the rapidly changing global trade environment. </p> \n   <p>The department would like to thank the Industry Working Group and other stakeholders who provided valuable input and feedback on the proposed levy design. </p> \n   <p>A levy will not be progressed and this decision will not impact on the overall biosecurity budget. </p> \n   <p>Australia\u2019s biosecurity system will continue to be funded through existing arrangements. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T02:26:16.972Z\">at 3.26am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec494418f0886ce4f5d6bff\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T02:23:06.199Z\">3.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Penny Wong </strong>also spoke to the ABC radio this morning (in Adelaide) where she repeated Labor\u2019s stance on the government\u2019s relationship with China:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think on the inquiry, if that\u2019s the question, this is the inquiry into the pandemic, I\u2019ve made very clear from the start we supported it.<br></p> \n   <p>And we welcome the resolution at the World Health Assembly to have an inquiry, a European Union-led resolution that has many countries signed up to it, including Australia.<br></p> \n   <p>It does differ from what <strong>Marise Payne</strong> announced on Insiders, in that the World Health Organisation is doing the inquiry.

They serve in their personal capacity, they are not, if you like, part of the WHO structure.

  "<p>When coronavirus first arrived in Britain, ministers initially placed their hopes on the summer months offering relief from the pandemic. The idea was that if they could suppress infections until the late spring, the change in temperature might help to stop the virus in its tracks.</p> <p>That wasn\u2019t to be.<strong> </strong>Scientific advice now suggests that temperature in and of itself has <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-summer-temperature-warm-hot-spread-study-pandemic-a9506201.html\">limited effect on Covid-19\u2019s spread</a>. Yet as the death toll continues to rise, prayers for sunny weather from government are louder than ever. Why? To help keep people onside over what has the potential to be a long, dull, stay-at-home British summer.</p> <p>With the prime minister, Boris Johnson, pitting himself against the bulk of his party over a gradual rather than a rapid easing of lockdown, the UK is now on course to move at a more stately pace than its European counterparts when it comes to socialising, the reopening of bars \u2013 and holidays. While the EU has a three-stage plan to restart tourism, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/global-report-italy-reopens-cafes-as-spain-prepares-for-return-of-tourists\">Italy and Spain</a> aim to reopen for visitors as early as June, the UK is taking a rather different approach.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/global-report-italy-reopens-cafes-as-spain-prepares-for-return-of-tourists\">Global report: Italy reopens cafes as Spain prepares for return of tourists</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Next month, a two-week quarantine is being introduced for all new arrivals to the UK, including British people returning from abroad. The move has been heavily criticised by the travel industry, with one trade body warning it will have a \u201cdevastating\u201d impact on the UK aviation industry and the wider economy.</p> <p>However, with Johnson determined to press on with what one No 10 adviser describes as the \u201cslow and steady\u201d path out of lockdown, the focus in government is not on appeasing airline companies but working out how to keep a potentially restless British public onside while its neighbours holiday.</p> <p>Even if talks of \u201cair bridges\u201d \u2013 allowing quarantine-free travel to and from low-infection countries such as Greece \u2013 come to fruition, the general sense in government is that the bulk of Britons will not be jetting abroad this summer.</p> <p>As well as quarantine and safety concerns, the economic reality means extravagant holidays just won\u2019t be an option for many. With unemployment set to increase even further and many on reduced household incomes, holidays are likely to be a luxury that people cannot afford. Social distancing practices mean that budget flights, too, could soon become much harder to find.</p> <p>As a result, ministers have begun to work out what they can do to keep morale up over the long summer months. While public support is now very much for lockdown continuing, the worry is what happens when other countries enjoy breaks with more ease. \u201cIf the R number rises in these countries as a result, we\u2019ll be praised for our response \u2013 if it doesn\u2019t, we might start to get some heat,\u201d explains one government figure.</p> <p>The great hope is that the weather gods will shine on the UK. The evidence suggests that activity outside carries a much lower risk of transmission than inside. Just look at how Northern Ireland is now allowing a half dozen people from different households to gather, if they are outside. All the plans to relax socialising coming down the tracks are based on being outside. \u201cIf it rains, we\u2019re fucked,\u201d says one rather blunt Tory MP.</p> <p>\u201cBritain\u2019s going to look like the 1940s this summer,\u201d predicts a government insider privy to discussions. Expect Mr Whippys on Bournemouth beach, camping breaks and, if we\u2019re lucky, drive-in cinemas.</p> <p>Talks are under way across departments to see what can be done to help retail businesses move outside. There is a focus on encouraging local councils to make it easy to cut red tape for businesses so they can adapt to a new normal in which trading outside is the preferred option. Inside No 10, one good-case scenario for mid-summer is that people will be permitted to dine outside at a restaurant with someone they don\u2019t live with.</p> <p>While restaurants and cafes are viewed as potential beneficiaries of good weather, the prospects for a lazy summer afternoon in the pub are bleaker. The concern is that the low cost of a pint means that it won\u2019t be financially viable for a pub to open its garden while taking in just a small number of people \u2013 whereas a more expensive restaurant could manage. But entrepreneurial landlords will be encouraged to think outside the box.</p> <p>The first holiday likely to be allowed will be camping \u2013 if that works out, then private home hire could be next. Hotels are viewed as harder to reopen due to the number of people coming and going. Discussions are under way over an extended holiday season \u2013 not just the typical high season of peak summer months \u2013 given that changing circumstances mean the traditional holiday period cannot be relied upon.</p> <p>Ministers are considering promoting parts of the UK that are usually off the tourist trail. With an increase expected in the number of domestic tourists, it\u2019s not only viewed as an opportunity to promote undiscovered spots \u2013 it could also be what\u2019s needed to keep MPs on side. On Tory WhatsApp, Devon and Cornwall MPs are already worried about an influx of people to their constituencies \u2013 with locals concerned about the virus spreading. However, in No 10 there\u2019s a sense that \u201ccommon sense\u201d will allow everyone an opportunity to explore.</p> <p>However, for all the efforts to keep the UK entertained this summer, the biggest risk factor may be not the weather but the economy. The furlough scheme is up for review in August and companies will be asked to pay a higher contribution. There is concern among MPs that this could be a crunch point for high unemployment. If that comes to pass, no amount of ice-cream by the coast or sitting around campfires will be enough to distract from the bad times ahead.</p> <p>\u2022 Katy Balls is the Spectator\u2019s deputy political editor</p>",
  "<p>Over the past few weeks, I have been kept awake by worries about care workers.</p> <p>More than 130 in England and Wales <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/causesofdeath/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19relateddeathsbyoccupationenglandandwales/deathsregistereduptoandincluding20april2020\">have already died</a> working on the frontline of the coronavirus crisis, having been let down by shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), a lack of testing and little recognition that they are putting their lives at risk every day.</p> <p>As someone who\u2019s been a care worker for the past 12 years and still works one morning a week, this makes me angry and very anxious for the future of social care.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/26/self-isolating-care-workers-debt-hunger-warns-charity\">Self-isolating UK care workers face debt and hunger, warns charity</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There has never been a question in my mind <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/20/care-workers-like-me-arent-low-skilled-these-immigration-rules-will-risk-lives\">whether care work is high or low skilled</a>. Supporting people to live the lives they want is one of the most difficult jobs there is.</p> <p>Care work is a very rewarding but hard profession that requires skills and values not everybody has: empathy, love and care. Care staff are always putting people they support before their own needs and doing whatever it takes to deliver the best quality of care possible. During this crisis care workers have had to take on new responsibilities, such as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/saralivadeas/status/1248148006634995713\">certifying causes of death</a> or delivering wound care, that would previously have been carried out by district nurses. That is on top all of the other duties care workers perform, seemingly in the shadows with society oblivious to their contributions.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/18/points-based-uk-immigration-bill-passed-by-parliament\">The government\u2019s new immigration policy</a>, which was voted through the House of Commons on Monday night, seems to ignore all of that.</p> <p>It classes care workers as \u201clow skilled\u201d, and while special exemptions have been made for visas <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/tier-5-seasonal-worker-visa\">for fruit pickers</a>, none have been made for care workers.</p> <p>To me that means that the government values strawberries more than it does elderly and vulnerable people and others who need care. To me it says that the amazing work care workers do every day is still not understood, recognised or respected. I am furious and saddened that yet again, social care is being ignored and pushed to the back of the queue in terms of its importance to the economy and society.</p> <p>Care work is not glamorous but it is fulfilling. The deep misunderstanding of the profession and the sector as a whole has led to decades of underfunding by different governments and lack of parity with the NHS. One cannot exist without the other, with the social care workforce larger than that of the NHS. And right now both sectors are working against the pandemic that has taken over the country.</p> <p>The majority of the social care workforce <a href=\"https://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/adult-social-care-workforce-data/Workforce-intelligence/publications/national-information/The-state-of-the-adult-social-care-sector-and-workforce-in-England.aspx\">is on low pay</a>, living pay cheque to pay cheque; looking after people while worrying about paying bills and feeding their children.</p> <p>Those who are shielding and self-isolating are having to make tough decisions between doing the right thing and their finances.</p> <p>Applications for my charity\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.thecareworkerscharity.org.uk/grants/\">grants</a> have increased 1,000% week on week compared with last year. We have been desperately <a href=\"https://www.justgiving.com/campaign/coronaviruscareworkersfund\">fundraising</a> to support as many people as possible. Low pay and lack of respect reinforce the notion that care work is unimportant and that the needs of care providers for staff from overseas are not a priority.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/20/society-weekly-email-newsletter-sign-up\">Sign up for Society Weekly: our newsletter for public service professionals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This cannot continue.

You can fly into them without trouble and legally travel between without having to isolate. But if you are coming from any other state or territory, chances are you will need to quarantine when you arrive back. </p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Queensland \u2013 </strong>There is currently a hard border closure in Queensland, meaning unless it\u2019s for essential reasons you are not allowed to enter the state. You can return if you are a Queensland resident, but if you have been to a \u201cCovid-19 hotspot\u201d in the last 14 days you must quarantine for two weeks.

You are not permitted to enter the state unless you have been granted a special exemption and, if you are a WA resident, you must apply for an exemption before you leave the state, and must isolate for 14 days when you return.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>South Australia \u2013 </strong>While SA has closed its border, it\u2019s a softer closure than Queensland or WA. You are allowed in but you must self-isolate for 14 days unless you are an essential traveller. </p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Tasmania \u2013 </strong>Similar to SA, all non-essential travellers to Tasmania must quarantine for 14 days upon arrival, including returning residents.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Northern Territory \u2013 </strong>All non-essential travellers entering the NT, including returning residents, must undergo 14 days mandatory quarantine and pay a \u2018quarantine fee\u2019 of $2,500 for individuals and $5,000 for families.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Which airlines are flying?</h2> \n<p>Currently Qantas, Virgin and Region Express airlines are flying extremely limited domestic schedules.</p> \n<p>Qantas and its budget arm Jetstar are preparing to ramp up domestic services when border restrictions ease, with the company\u2019s chief executive, Alan Joyce, urging travellers to begin planning their trips.</p> \n<p>Rex also appears to be preparing for increased regional travel.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s unclear if and when Virgin will begin regular interstate flights as the company is currently in voluntary administration. This includes the company\u2019s low-cost offshoot TigerAir.</p> \n<h2>Will there be physical distancing on flights?</h2> \n<p>No.</p> \n<p>The Qantas chief executive has stated the airline <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/19/qantas-decision-to-fill-australian-flights-to-capacity-condemned-by-infectious-disease-experts\">will not be observing physical distancing</a> aboard planes, either by spacing out passengers or leaving middle rows free. Joyce said that doing so would drastically inflate ticket prices and, given the seemingly low rates of transmission on aeroplanes, would not be economically justifiable.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/19/qantas-decision-to-fill-australian-flights-to-capacity-condemned-by-infectious-disease-experts\">Qantas decision to fill Australian flights to capacity condemned by infectious disease experts</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cThis idea of the middle seat [being left free] isn\u2019t social distancing, it\u2019s a 60cm difference between two people.

As far as the virus goes, an aircraft cabin is a very different environment to other forms of public transport,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn-flight transmission\u2019s just not something that we\u2019ve seen, and that was even during the peak of the pandemic. At this point and into the coming weeks the likelihood of anyone travelling domestically with Covid is extremely low, and those other factors mean that the risk is infinitesimal.\u201d</p> \n<p>But a number of epidemiologists and infectious disease experts do not agree.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Prof Raina MacIntyre, a virologist at the University of NSW, told ABC she would not be flying until vaccinated for Covid-19.</p> \n<p>The infectious disease expert and epidemiology professor Marylouise McLaws told Guardian Australia that, like other densely populated enclosed spaces, planes were likely \u201cbrilliant amplification environments\u201d for the virus.</p> \n<p>\u201cPerhaps there haven\u2019t been confirmed cases from flights, but that doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t be careful, and it could just mean we haven\u2019t identified them as a risk factor yet \u2026 There are still a significant amount of cases that are under investigation,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Many planes have advanced air filtration systems that refresh the air in the cabins every few minutes and remove virus particles, but multiple epidemiologists have said this likely won\u2019t protect you if someone in your immediate area is infectious.</p> \n<h2>Should I wear a mask on a flight?</h2> \n<p>Yes, unless you have a medical reason not to.</p> \n<p>Regardless of whether an airline mandates wearing a mask, McLaws said it is a vital step in protecting yourself and others on flights.</p> \n<p>\u201cPreventing Covid-19 is a bundle of many things \u2026 When you can\u2019t have one of those, such as social distancing, you need to protect yourself from inhaling or exhaling the virus with a mask.\u201d</p> \n<p>Even if you are not directly seated near other people, wearing a mask is still important as people are regularly moving around the cabin, through narrow aisles.</p> \n<p>It may be difficult for those with respiratory illnesses such as emphysema to wear a mask, but if you are medically able, McLaw highly recommends you do so at all times while flying.</p> \n<p>Qantas is currently not planning to make mask-wearing mandatory when its \u201cfly well\u201d safety procedures roll out on 12 June. It will be providing masks to all passengers and recommending they be worn, but will only require this if a passenger is displaying symptoms during the flight.</p> \n<p>From 1 June it will be mandatory for all passengers on Regional Express flights to wear a mask while travelling unless they are exempt for medical reasons. While you can purchase a mask at the time of your flight, passengers are encouraged to bring their own.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/apr/22/bad-neighbour-will-the-cruise-industry-ever-be-the-same-again-after-coronavirus\">'Bad neighbour': will the cruise industry resume its rise in Australia after coronavirus?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>McLaws notes that if lower grade or cloth face masks are being used passengers should not talk during the flight.</p> \n<p>\u201cCloth masks provide anywhere between 10 and 60% protection.

This will push particles through the looser weave.\u201d</p> \n<h2>What else are airlines doing?</h2> \n<p>Qantas has laid out a \u201cfly well\u201d program, which aims to increase safety on all Qantas and Jetstar flights. Measures at airports include contactless check-ins, extra disinfectant stations at terminals and rearranging the Qantas lounge. Onboard there is additional cleaning of aircraft, travellers being asked to limit movements around the cabin, limits on the number of times attendants offer food and drinks, and the provision of alcohol wipes to all passengers.</p> \n<p>Rex will also have mandatory temperature testing of all passengers and Qantas appears to be ramping up this testing as well. On both airlines, travellers with flu-like symptoms will be turned away from flights.<br></p> \n<h2>What if I feel sick on the day of my flight?</h2> \n<p>Along with new safety procedures, Qantas has increased flexibility for all Qantas and Jetstar flights.</p> \n<p>For domestic flights booked between 21 May and 30 June, for travel between 12 June and 31 October, the change of flight fee will be waived one time.</p> \n<p>This means as long as you haven\u2019t already changed your booking, if you wake up with a raised temperature or any flu-like symptoms you are able to reschedule your flight with no charge. If you are denied boarding due to illness you can also be moved to another flight free of charge.</p> \n<p>Rex said that in the event that someone was denied check-in due because they had a high temperature, the airline would allow them to rebook for a later date. Any refund would be considered on a case by case basis.</p> \n<h2>Is it too soon to be planning an interstate holiday?</h2> \n<p>It depends on who you ask, but currently, no states or territories are actively encouraging travellers to come to visit.</p> \n<p>The national cabinet guidelines have suggested 10 July as the time to review interstate travel, however, it\u2019s unclear which states are likely to follow this.</p> \n<p>The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has said the state\u2019s borders would be reviewed at the end of each month, with September floated as a \u201crealistic\u201d timeframe by the state\u2019s chief health officer.</p> \n<p>Previously, the Northern Territory chief minister, Michael Gunner, said the state border would be lifted \u201cdead last\u201d and Western Australia appears to be on a similar trajectory.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has urged other states to reopen sooner rather than later, and holiday travel inside the state will be allowed from 1 June.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily coronavirus newsletter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download it</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The federal tourism minister, Simon Birmingham, said he would like to see restriction relaxed in time for the winter tourism boom.</p> \n<p>\u201cThose states who\u2019ve got border controls in place, assuming we\u2019ve continued to see very low rates of transmission of Covid-19, ought to be looking at opening up their borders,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe need people moving across this country again when it\u2019s safe to do so.\u201d</p> \n<p>Unsurprisingly, airlines are also keen to see travel begin again.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe look forward hopefully to seeing a lot of you on our flights in July for a holiday,\u201d Joyce said.</p> \n<p>\u201cI encourage you to do your research now and to look at some of the very attractive airfares we\u2019re going to have \u2026 If you need to visit family and friends, now\u2019s the time to start planning.\u201d</p>",

Cork United emerged in 1940 after the dissolution of Cork City (a separate entity to the current League of Ireland members) and took the league by storm, winning three consecutive titles and adding two more in 1945 and 1946. A mere two years later, however, and they too were gone. Dolphin were a Dublin club who won the title in 1935 but resigned in 1937, unable to compete with the more established city clubs.\u201d</p> <p>Dean Whearty has another League of Ireland example. \u201cSporting Fingal \u2013 founded in 2007 and dissolved in 2011 \u2013 had 965 days between their first and last match. In that time, they won the domestic cup, won promotion to the top division (finishing fourth in their one and only season) and lost a dramatic Europa League tie 6-4 to Maritimo.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK95iaAyqWo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SK95iaAyqWo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>It would appear the US is also a hotbed for champions who fell hard and fast. \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Spurs\">Kansas City Spurs</a>, founding members of the NASL, won the championship in 1969, having the best record in the second part of the season. They folded in 1970,\u201d recalls Stephen Moffit. \u201cIn 1983, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_Roughnecks_(1978%E2%80%931984)\">Tulsa Roughnecks</a> were 2-0 winners of the Soccer Bowl against the Toronto Blizzard. The NASL, of course, folded in 1984. The Roughnecks played friendlies for one more season before ceasing to exist.\u201d</p> <p>But Dave Mellinger can offer us two champion clubs who disappeared so quickly their crowning wins were mere whispers in the wind. \u201cIn 2009 in the top tier of US WPS, the Los Angeles Sol won the regular season, which ended on 9 August. This being the States, there was also a playoff winner, but we\u2019ll ignore them for now. Before the next season started, the team was dissolved \u2013 on 28 January 2010, only 172 days later. The Sol were tortoises, however, compared to what happened next. The following season, FC Gold Pride won the playoff championship on 26 September 2010 \u2013 they had won the regular season shortly before \u2013 and folded, never to be resurrected, on 16 November of the same year. That\u2019s a hare-like 51 days between the championship and dissolution.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"980c4d4703e1251a5e2b8b9b39342717f6d5f43e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/980c4d4703e1251a5e2b8b9b39342717f6d5f43e/0_542_3706_2224/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The 2009 Romanian champions Unirea Urziceni went out of business in 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 2009 Romanian champions, Unirea Urziceni, went out of business in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Mih\u0103ilescu/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Mind the gap</h2> <p><strong>\u201cEdwin van der Sar won the Champions League with Ajax in 1995 and Manchester United in 2008.

His second professional appearance was on loan for Boston United in National League North, five down from the top flight (four from where Town are now). He\u2019s played once in the Championship (against Leeds) for Town since returning from Boston. If he isn\u2019t selected again in 2019-20 and Town are relegated, his first appearance in League One would be a proper (albeit unwanted) record. Surely a record of sorts and a question in its own right, perhaps? Please ask if anyone can \u2018beat\u2019 Demeaco\u2019s ups and downs, (with respect to Boston, who were in the same division as Town in 2003-04).\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"619ecac550646a76b3d3338bfee5c99387c07acb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/619ecac550646a76b3d3338bfee5c99387c07acb/0_184_4908_2945/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demeaco Duhaney seen here during his second appearance for Huddersfield Town, against Leeds in the Championship.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demeaco Duhaney seen here during his second appearance for Huddersfield Town, against Leeds in the Championship.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Early/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Knowledge archive</h2> <p><strong>\u201cAfter an obscure discussion I ended up on the Wikipedia page of former Liverpool and Leicester goalkeeper Pegguy Arphexad who, it says, made 39 appearances in a 16-year career,\u201d</strong> begins Neal Robb. <strong>\u201cI thought this must be a record and checked back to see if this had been a topic and I see from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jul/12/knowledge-football-fewest-appearances\">this Knowledge article</a> on the fewest appearances in a professional career that Stuart Taylor\u2019s 86 was the lowest found.\u201d</strong></p> <p>It would appear you do indeed have a new leading leisurely pro, Neal.

Movement through spaces will need to be tightly managed to prevent people pooling around exhibits.

  "<p>Since the pandemic was declared all Australian states wentinto various levels of lockdown.</p> \n<p>On Friday 8 May, the federal government announced a three-stage plan to ease coronavirus restrictions across the country, with the goal of reaching stage three by July. Ultimately, though, it is up to each state and territory to decide when and how far they would be relaxing restrictions in the coming months.</p> \n<p>The states and territories have already announced their plans in response.</p> \n<p>So what are the laws as they currently stand?</p> \n<p>These are the laws as of Wednesday 20 May.<strong> </strong>This article will be updated as new restrictions are implemented or repealed.</p> \n<h2>Queensland</h2> \n<p>Under the current regulations in Queensland, up to five adults from different<strong> </strong>households are allowed to visit another home.

Barriers are still erected in the<strong> </strong>Gold Coast suburb of Coolangatta, which straddles both Queensland and NSW. There are some exemptions for those who regularly cross the Queensland-NSW border for work.</p> \n<p>Up to 10 people can gather outside. This means that groups of 10 or less can engage in outdoor non-contact sport, group training and boot camps, and picnics. Queenslanders can also go to the park, playground, skatepark, or national park for recreational purposes.</p> \n<p>Weddings are<strong> </strong>allowed 10 guests, and funerals 20 guests indoors and 30 outdoors.</p> \n<p>Beauty salons can<strong> </strong>open back up, and pubs and cafes in regional or rural areas with no cases are<strong> </strong>able to seat up to 20 people. Open homes will also be allowed.</p> \n<p>The second stage of relaxing restrictions will start on 12 June, and see gatherings of up to 20 people; indoor cinemas, entertainment venues and amusement parks reopening; and greater recreational travel distances allowed.</p> \n<p>Stage three will start on 10 July. While premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said<strong> </strong>details are \u201csubject to further planning and review\u201d, intrastate and interstate travel will be permitted, and a maximum of 100 people allowed to gather in homes, public spaces, and other venues including cinemas, places of worship, and restaurants.</p> \n<p>Queensland police officers are still able to issue on-the-spot fines of $1,334.50 for individuals and $6,672.50 for corporations who breach these laws.

Tasmania has a broad definition of \u201csocial support. As such, families and couples who live apart can<strong> </strong>visit one another\u2019s homes.</p> \n<p>However, in public, the two-person gathering limit is strictly applied.</p> \n<p>From 18 May, Tasmania will move to stage one, which will mean indoor and outdoor gatherings of up to 10 people, up to five visitors to a home, and up to 10 people inside restaurants, cafe and other venues.</p> \n<p>The premier confirmed that the state\u2019s strict border controls will remain in place.</p> \n<p>From 25 May, primary school students will return to school, as well as year 11 an 12 students. From 9 June, high school students from year 7 to 10 will also return to school. And from From 15 June, the state will move to stage 2, subject to health advice.</p> \n<p>Stage two will kick off on 15 June.</p> \n<p>Gatherings will increase to 20 people at a time, both indoor at outdoor. This means that up to 20 people will be able to attend religious gatherings and weddings, and up to 50 people will be allowed to attend a funeral.</p> \n<p>Under stage two, people will be able to move around the state, go camping, and stay in overnight boats and holiday shacks. Gyms and bootcamps will open to 20 people, while beauty services including tattoo parlours would also be allowed.</p> \n<p> Australian defence force members, the Tasmanian state emergency service and fire service volunteers have been enlisted to help carry out spot checks.</p> \n<p>Fines could be as much as $16,800 or six months in jail.</p> \n<p>Tasmania also requires that all non-essential travellers entering the state quarantine for a period of 14 days.</p> \n<h2>Western Australia</h2> \n<p>Western Australian has<strong> </strong>already seen perhaps the most significant easing of lockdown laws.</p> \n<p>As of Monday 18 May,<strong> </strong>up to 20<strong> </strong>people are allowed to gather publicly and privately. Residents are allowed to leave their homes for recreational<strong> </strong> activities including picnics, fishing, boating or camping.</p> \n<p> Cafes and restaurants \u2013 including dine-in services at pubs, clubs and casinos - are<strong> </strong>allowed to seat 20 diners, as long as they follow the four sq metres per person rule.</p> \n<p>Non-contact sport, outdoor and indoor fitness classes, and public swimming pools have been allowed to reopen to up to 20 participants at a time. The number of attendees at weddings and funerals has increased to 20 if held indoors, or 30 if outdoors.</p> \n<p>Places of worship and community facilities, like libraries, are<strong> </strong>also allowed up to 20 people inside.</p> \n<p>Open houses and display villages are<strong> </strong> allowed to operate, however public playgrounds, skateparks and outdoor gym equipment are closed. </p> \n<p>Travel to most<strong> </strong>nearby regions is now allowed. But travel is<strong> </strong>still restricted to remote communities in the Pilbara, Goldfields, and Kimberley.</p> \n<p>It doesn\u2019t look as though WA will be opening its borders to interstate travellers any time soon, though. As of<strong> </strong>midnight on 6 April only \u201cexempt travellers\u201d have been allowed in. This includes WA residents. A list of \u201cexempt travellers\u201d <a href=\"https://www.wa.gov.au/sites/default/files/2020-04/Quarantine%20%28Closing%20the%20Border%29%20Directions.pdf\">can be found here</a>, and includes senior government officials, military personal and a range of essential workers.</p> \n<p>McGowan said that hard borders \u201chas been our strongest weapon in the fight against this virus\u201d and \u201cwill likely be the final restriction that we lift\u201d.</p> \n<p>Officers can issue on-the-spot fines of $1,000 for individuals and $5,000 for businesses who disobey the rules.</p> \n<h2><strong>Australian Capital Territory</strong></h2> \n<p>As of 8 May, gatherings of up to 10 people indoors and outdoors are allowed in the ACT. That includes boot camps, picnics, house inspections and auctions.</p> \n<p>Indoor funerals will are allowed to have up to 20 attendees, while those taking place outside can have up to 30 attendees.</p> \n<p>ACT chief minister Andrew<strong> </strong>Barr has advised Canberrans to avoid large crowds, keep 1.5m apart from others, continue to practice good hand hygiene and to \u201cstay home\u201d from work or school of they are sick.</p> \n<p>He previously urged residents to stay at home,<strong> </strong>except for <a href=\"https://www.cmtedd.act.gov.au/open_government/inform/act_government_media_releases/barr/2020/act-chief-minister-statement-canberrans-must-stay-at-home-unless-essential\">certain essential reasons</a>.</p> \n<p>These are:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Shopping for what you need \u2013 food and necessary supplies</p></li> \n <li><p>Medical or healthcare needs, including compassionate requirements</p></li> \n <li><p>Exercise in compliance with the public gathering requirements</p></li> \n <li><p>Work and study if you can\u2019t work or learn remotely</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>ACT police officers would be issuing a warning in the first instance.</p> \n<p>Guardian Australia understands that police have focused on enforcing the two-person gathering limits, not why people have left their homes.</p> \n<h2>Northern Territory</h2> \n<p>The Northern Territory already commenced its three-stage plan to ease restrictions in the state in early May.</p> \n<p>The NT currently has a 10-person gathering limit indoors and outdoors.</p> \n<p>From Friday 8 May<strong> </strong>these were lifted for outdoor weddings and funerals. An unlimited number of people may attend as long as physical distancing can still be observed.</p> \n<p>Since 1 May,<strong> </strong>Territorians have been allowed to use public swimming pools, go fishing with friends and play non-contact sports like golf or tennis and visit waterparks, as long as safe physical distancing can be observed.</p> \n<p>National parks are also open for camping, swimming and hiking.</p> \n<p> Since<strong> </strong>15 May additional<strong> </strong>indoor activities have been permitted, as long as they take less than two hours. These<strong> </strong>include going to the gym, eating at a cafe or restaurant, visiting a museum or undergoing non-facial cosmetic procedures like manicures or tanning. Bars can reopen but alcohol can only be served with a meal.</p> \n<p>Indoor weddings, funerals and religious activities will also be allowed.</p> \n<p>From 5 June all businesses will be allowed to reopen as long as they have a Covid-19 plan. The two-hour limit will be lifted allowing night clubs, cinemas, tattoo parlours casinos and pokies to reopen. However physical distancing must still be observed.</p> \n<p>All sporting activities will be allowed to restart from 5 June and spectators will be allowed to attend.</p> \n<p>Currently, remote Indigenous communities have protections in place to stop non-essential visitors from entering, and quarantine periods for residents returning from community hubs. The protections will be assessed and potentially lifted on 18 June.</p> \n<p>Gunner said that opening the NT border would be \u201cdead last\u201d.</p> \n<p>The Northern Territory currently requires any non-essential travellers to self-quarantine in a hotel for a period of 14 days. As of 3 April, the traveller must pay for the expenses associated with this quarantine period.<strong> </strong></p> \n<h2>South Australia</h2> \n<p>South Australia has not formally lifted any physical distancing laws, but the state never imposed the strict lockdowns seen in Victoria, NSW or WA.</p> \n<p>South Australia<strong> </strong>opted not to enforce new two-person-gathering laws, but premier Steven Marshall had<strong> </strong>still urged people to follow these rules.</p> \n<p>Since Monday 11 May,<strong> </strong> outdoor dining at restaurants and cafes has<strong> </strong>recommenced for groups of up to 10 people. From 22 May, restaurants and cafes will be able to serve 10 patrons indoors and 10 outdoors simultaneously. Alcohol will be able to be served to diners.</p> \n<p>Pubs will be able to serve seated patrons food and alcohol from 5 June, when the state moves to stage two. Cinemas and theatres will also be allowed to reopen under stage two.</p> \n<p>In addition to those officiating, funerals are now<strong> </strong>able to have 20 people attend indoor ceremonies, and 30 outdoors. Non-contact sport, house auctions and open inspections have also resumed.<strong> </strong></p> \n<p>The state is also<strong> </strong>reopening university and Tafe tutorials, public libraries, pools, churches and community halls.</p> \n<p>The SA government has also already also welcomed students back into classrooms for term two.</p> \n<p>On-the-spot fines of $1,000 still will only be applied to those who are gathering in groups larger than 10.</p> \n<p> Marshall has also announced stage two of the state\u2019s plan to ease coronavirus restrictions. From 8 June, South Australia will see the reopening of cinemas and theatres, seated dining, gyms and indoor fitness, galleries and museums, and beauty services. Sporting competition will also start back up, without spectators.</p> \n<p>Future steps for consideration also include larger gatherings, reopening of nightclubs, pubs and bars, and easing state border restrictions and travel into protected communities. No date was given for when these steps could be implemented, though.</p> \n<p>Social distancing rules must still be followed, and gatherings must abide by the one person per four square meters rules.</p> \n<p>All people entering South Australia are required to undertake a 14-day quarantine.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>This article was amended on 15 April 2020 to correct the statement that Queensland has announced a state of emergency.

In early April, both countries declared their seaports \u201cunsafe\u201d due to the pandemic, closing their borders to migrant landings. As a result, boats carrying asylum seekers were left adrift in European search and rescue (SAR) zones. An unknown number <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/calls-in-italy-to-rescue-people-at-sea-after-fears-of-more-migrant-deaths\">died at sea</a> of starvation, dehydration or drowning.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://alarmphone.org/en/2020/05/20/maltas-dangerous-manoeuvres-at-sea/\">A report that Alarm Phone shared with the Guardian</a> states: \u201cOver recent months, and especially in April 2020, Alarm Phone has documented how the Maltese authorities have orchestrated push-backs from within the Maltese SAR zone, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/world/europe/malta-migrant-boat.html\">sabotaged migrant boats</a>, failed to render assistance and to bring people to safety, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/19/exclusive-12-die-as-malta-uses-private-ships-to-push-migrants-back-to-libya\">left migrants to die off the Maltese coast</a> while organising their forced return to Libya by private vessels.\u201d</p> \n<p>When the flimsy and overloaded dinghy carrying the 101 migrants reached Pozzallo, there was amazement that such a small vessel with so many people aboard could make the 500km trip to Italy from Libya.

After three days, on the morning of 11 April, they saw Malta.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe saw commercial vessels, big ones,\u201d said one of the survivors. \u201cThey didn\u2019t approach us at all. Around 5am, when the sun started rising, we saw Malta, we saw the buildings of Malta. Everyone was happy and yelling.\u2019\u2019</p> \n<p>The migrants said they were intercepted by the vessel. \u201cThey gave us life vests and around 20 or 25 people jumped into the water and almost drowned,\u201d said another survivor. \u201cSo [the Maltese boat] started turning around so we wouldn\u2019t swim to the city. They were likely to kill us. They made waves. They gave us ropes and told us to hold on to the ropes and tie them to our boat and go back.\u201d</p> \n<p>According to the witnesses, a second AFM vessel arrived at the scene and an officer informed the dinghy passengers that Malta was infected by the virus and unable to accept more people. </p> \n<p>\u201cThen one of the Maltese officials said, \u2018Ok we made a decision, we won\u2019t return you to Libya\u2019,\u201d said another survivor. \u201cHe said, \u2018We will show you the route to Italy\u2019.\u201d We said, \u2018No, we don\u2019t have fuel\u2019. They said, \u2018Ok we will give you fuel\u2019. They gave us five gallons, 20 litres. Then we turned on the motor and it didn\u2019t work. We told the officials that the previous Maltese vessel attached a rope to our boat to try pulling us back, but it hit the engine many times and the engine broke. They gave us a new engine, a 45 or 40 Yamaha.\u201d</p> \n<p>The testimony matches photographs provided by the survivors. In a photo taken before the encounter with the Maltese, a \u201cParsun 60\u201d motor can be seen. Afterwards \u201cYamaha\u201d is visible on the new motor, which was allegedly provided. At that point, the Maltese officials gave the migrants the coordinates to reach Sicily.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe kept moving until the next day, and around 10am we arrived in Italy,\u201d said one of the asylum seekers.</p> \n<p>\u201cDoes Malta consider the manoeuvres driven by the AFM vessel P02 in line with search and rescue operation standards? And were the Italian authorities informed about this case of 101 people in distress and about the presence of this boat before its arrival to the shores of Sicily?\u2019\u2019asks Alarm Phone.</p> \n<p>When contacted by the Guardian, the Italian coastguard said Malta did not alert them about the boat.</p> \n<p>AFM and Malta\u2019s government did not respond to requests for comment.<br></p>",

The program is expected to provide $500 per person or $1,000 to households and benefit about 150,000 families \u2013 a fraction of the estimated 2 million undocumented immigrants living in California.</p> <p>Ana Padilla, the executive director of UC Merced\u2019s Community and Labor Center, <a href=\"https://www.fresnobee.com/news/coronavirus/article242817371.html?\">told the Fresno Bee</a> the available funds are expected to evaporate \u201cvery quickly\u201d.</p> <p>Initially, the state told those seeking benefits that they could leave information in a voicemail when they call to apply if they didn\u2019t connect with a representative.</p> <p>Early Tuesday, however, Jewish Family Service, a nonprofit picked to distribute funds to undocumented workers in the San Diego area, posted on its <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jewishfamilyservicesd/\">Facebook page new guidance</a> from the state: callers must reach a live person.</p> <p>\u201cThe State of California is requiring that all calls to the Disaster Relief Assistance for Immigrants (DRAI) hotlines must be answered live. There will no longer be a voicemail option. Phone lines are open every day, 7 days per week, 8am to 10pm \u2013 increased by one hour. If you do not get through when you call, please keep calling back until you get through. There may be long delays,\u201d the new directive said.</p> <p>\u201cPeople have been very anxious and desperate for information,\u201d said Christian Arana, the director of policy at the philanthropic Latino Community Foundation (LCF). Even though his organization is not distributing funds, he said phone calls and visitors to the LCF website spiked after the program\u2019s website crashed or callers couldn\u2019t get through.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a race to see who can get the money the fastest. People are calling at all hours, wanting to be first in line because they think, \u2018If I\u2019m not first, I\u2019m not getting that money\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>The huge demand speaks to the financial realities for undocumented families.</p> <p>\u201cChirla got more than 1.1m phone calls yesterday \u2013 and that\u2019s just one organization. That, to me, shows the immensity of need across the state,\u201d Arana said.</p>",

unspecified reforms or lose out on US funding.</p> \n  <p>A resolution that backed the WHO\u2019s leadership and said there needed to be an investigation into the global response to the coronavirus pandemic won endorsement at the WHO\u2019s annual ministerial meeting on Tuesday.</p> \n  <p>The US president launched his attack late on Monday, sending a lengthy letter outlining America\u2019s belief that the WHO had not been sufficiently independent of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a>, and had been too willing to accept its explanations for the origins of the coronavirus outbreak.</p> \n  <p>As the pandemic worsens in the US, and other countries begin a tentative recovery, Trump has sought to blame China and the WHO. The letter accused the WHO of making repeated mistakes, meaning thousands of lives had been lost, and America\u2019s interests not served.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIf the WHO does not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days, I will make my temporary freeze of United States funding to the WHO permanent and reconsider our membership,\u201d Trump told its chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.</p> \n  <p>His attack was timed to coincide with the start of the two-day World <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/health\">Health</a> Assembly, which on Tuesday finally backed a draft resolution that supported a WHO-established independent and impartial inquiry into the WHO\u2019s conduct over the coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>The resolution, supported by China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, on Monday and largely drafted by the European Union, stops short of the kind of international inquiry focused on China\u2019s conduct that was first canvassed by Australia and the US.

It has been licensed for use in the US since the mid 1950s and is listed by the World Health Organization as an \u201cessential\u201d medicine.</p> \n  <h2><strong>What\u2019s the state of the current evidence?</strong><br></h2> \n  <p>In May, the British Medical Journal reported on a randomised (although still problematic) clinical trial in China that found little evidence hydroxychloroquine worked, with serious adverse events noted in two patients.</p> \n  <p>A second study reported in the BMJ last week on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/vital-drug-people-lupus-coronavirus-covid-19-link-hydroxychloroquine\">French trial</a> also concluded that hydroxychloroquine does not significantly reduce admission to intensive care or improve survival rates in patients hospitalised with pneumonia owing to Covid-19. Overall, 89% of those who received hydroxychloroquine survived after 21 days, compared with 91% in the control group.</p> \n  <p>The US Food and Drug Administration in a safety alert issued on 24 April warned that it had received reports that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine could have serious side-effects and that the drugs should be taken only under the close supervision of a doctor in a hospital setting or a clinical trial.</p> \n  <h2>What are the risks in taking hydroxychloroquine?</h2> \n  <p>There are a number of side-effects. The most serious is that it can interfere with the rhythm of the heart. Other side-effects include headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, skin rash or itching or hair loss. Research published by the Mayo Clinic has suggested that \u201coff-label\u201d repurposing of drugs such as hydroxychloroquine could lead to \u201cdrug-induced sudden cardiac death\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Although Trump\u2019s official physician has said he was in \u201cvery good health\u201d at his last official checkup, the president is 73 and his recorded weight would put him in a BMI category of \u201cclinically obese\u201d.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/19/hydroxychloroquine-trump-and-covid-19-what-you-need-to-know\">Hydroxychloroquine, Trump and Covid-19: what you need to know</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-19T21:23:14.470Z\">at 10.23pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec447a38f0864e579f1405f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-19T21:05:40.952Z\">10.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Today so far</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>That\u2019s it from me today.

  "<p>Despite the fact it costs Australia over $8bn a year in subsidies, Australia\u2019s childcare system is so broken that when Covid-19 hit us, it was one of the first sectors the government needed to bail out. Mass closures of centres were on the cards.</p> <p>A rescue package that gave childcare operators 50% of the government revenue they received in a pre-pandemic reference fortnight and access to jobkeeper payments was hastily rolled out. The package also gave families free childcare.</p> <p>How did it work? For some childcare services, it worked as intended. They now had enough money to make it through to a post-pandemic world.</p> <p>For others, it was a disaster. Family daycare and in-home care services were especially hard hit. It may be reasonable to ask businesses to front the cash to keep their staff on, but family daycare and in-home care educators are mostly sole traders. Asking women that already live on small incomes to live on dramatically smaller ones until their jobkeeper came through caused all manner of pain. Services that had a lot of educators ineligible for jobkeeper because of their visa type or because they relied mostly on casual employees have also barely survived.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/11/free-childcare-has-been-amazing-australian-parents-hope-pandemic-may-pave-way-for-reform\">'Free childcare has been amazing': Australian parents hope pandemic may pave way for reform</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some services fell through the system completely. New services that started after the reference fortnight. Services run by local government or large charities, such as UnitingCare, that were ineligible for jobkeeper. Services that have maintained full occupancy have also struggled.</p> <p>The government has been playing whack-a-mole with an exceptional circumstances fund but the childcare sector almost universally agrees the government\u2019s definition of an exceptional circumstance is way too limited.</p> <p>And it was these services the package didn\u2019t work for who have railed the most against \u201cfree childcare\u201d. To them, free childcare for families has been funded by educators and services, not the government. They argue they could survive if they were able to charge those families that could afford it, fees as usual.</p> <p>The government is under increased pressure as the flaws in the system become more obvious. Services are having to turn away mothers coming back from maternity leave and families that need additional days to match their work requirements because they can\u2019t afford the cost of caring for more children.</p> <p>When the prime minister announced free childcare, he said he did not want parents having to choose between feeding their children and having their children cared for and educated.</p> <p>\u201cThis virus is going to take enough from Australians without putting Australian parents in that position,\u201d he said.</p> <p>His tune has now changed and he is ready for things to snap back. In the case of childcare, snap back is taking away the life raft before we have made it to land.</p> <p>With 600,000 more people unemployed across Australia, snapping back to a subsidy method that provided only minimal access to those not in paid work, is nuts. Services will see their occupancy levels falling dramatically and will struggle once again to stay afloat. Asking families to snap back to paying large chunks of their income for childcare in a time when everyone is going to have to tighten our belts, is just not smart.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/19/its-done-its-job-dan-tehan-flags-end-of-free-childcare-under-weight-of-increasing-demand\">\u2018It\u2019s done its job\u2019: Dan Tehan flags end of free childcare under weight of increasing demand</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is a chance to radically reform how we provide childcare in this country. We could design a system that really works to enable women as the primary carers of children to fully participate in the workforce, that isn\u2019t subsidised on the backs of the labour of its largely female, and grossly underpaid, workforce. A system that it is not set up in a way that allows shareholders, landlords and private equity investors to profiteer from its provision and above all one that provides our children with the early education and care they deserve.</p> <p>This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get it right. Let\u2019s not squander the opportunity.</p> <p>Let\u2019s start with a core fact. As a country we need our children to have the best start to their education possible. A gazillion pieces of research exist that say universal access to early education is the missing key. Especially when it is delivered by highly qualified and well-trained educators. When that early education is being provided to children, it can be accompanied by care in such a way that enables parents to participate in the workforce.</p> <p>Most economically advanced countries have grasped this and provide their children with free or very low-cost early education and care.</p> <p>Australia can do this too. And this is what we need to argue for: well-funded, high-quality education and care provided by highly qualified and well-remunerated educators and early childhood teachers. And the best way to do this? Make it free.</p> <p>Make it free like it is now, but this time fund it adequately so that \u201cfree childcare\u201d does not come at the expense of educators and services.</p> <p>Make it free not because it\u2019s a crazy lefty idea with no precedent, but because this system already exists for children once they reach the age of five. Since the late 1800s children in Australia have been able to receive a free public education. But for some reason, even though we now know that the majority of a child\u2019s learning actually takes place in the first five years of life, this right has never been extended to our youngest children. Until now.</p> <p>Early education and care advocates have long had fantasies of Australia providing play-based free early education and care to all children. The crisis of Covid-19 made this concept less fantastical. Free early education and care was not just possible, but absolutely necessary. It is still necessary. It needs to be a much better designed system than that hastily cobbled together by bureaucrats and politicians responding to the crisis, but it needs to keep existing.</p> <p>It needs to exist because our children deserve the best education our country can give them. And there is no doubt that is one that starts early, that parents can afford and simultaneously allows their parents to work.</p> <p>Having tasted free early education and care and having also found what life is really like trying to work from home with very young children underfoot, I\u2019m willing to bet that parents will be aghast at any government that tries to remove their \u201cfree childcare\u201d.</p> <ul> <li><p>Lisa Bryant is an advocate for education and care in Australia and a consultant to education and care services</p></li> </ul> <p><br></p>"
