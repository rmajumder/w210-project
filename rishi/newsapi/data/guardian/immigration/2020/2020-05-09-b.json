  "<p><strong>Names:</strong> Celia and Richard Craig<br><strong>Years together: </strong>30<br><strong>Occupations:</strong> Musicians </p> <p>When Celia Craig travelled to Australia in 1989, her plan was to call things off with Richard, the clarinetist she\u2019d met while they were studying music at the University of York two years earlier. She was English, he was Australian and they\u2019d been exchanging letters in the time they\u2019d been apart \u2013 ostensibly just as friends but with \u201ca lot of flirting going on\u201d.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t think they\u2019d have a future together, but she was curious about Sydney: \u201cHe was writing me stories about baby magpies and how nice it was to be back and how nice it smelled and I was thinking, \u2018I wonder what that\u2019s like?\u2019\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/25/love-in-a-time-of-covid-tell-us-how-you-stay-together\">Love in a time of Covid: tell us how you stay together</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She was certain he\u2019d welcome her with open arms. That laissez faire attitude lasted until the moment she touched down in Sydney. \u201cI\u2019d saved up all the money, I was all excited, and then the second [he] turned up at the airport, I was like, \u2018Oh my God. What if this doesn\u2019t work?\u2019\u201d she remembers. \u201cBut within about 20 minutes, I knew it would be fine.\u201d</p> <p>And it was fine. In fact it was such a good trip that they were married the following year back in England. In 2006, they migrated to Australia and in June the couple will celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary.</p> <p>A love of music drew them together. Celia was 19 and a talented oboist in her first year of university, while Richard was 25 and doing a postgrad degree. Aside from his obvious musical abilities, she thought he was \u201creally cool and influential\u201d, admiring the way he organised groups to play chamber music. He\u2019d heard she was good and so he invited her to join one. \u201cI\u2019ve always had a bit of a weakness for talented women,\u201d he says. \u201cSo we organised this Brahms sextet. Celia was playing oboe and I thought, \u2018Wow. That\u2019s how an oboe is supposed to sound.\u2019 Plus she had these very sexy dimples, so I was immediately attracted to her.\u201d</p> <p>He adds: \u201cThe thing is, she was right up there with me intellectually and musically, and on the same wavelength in so many ways. So even though there was a fair age difference and she was only in her first year out of high school, I always saw her as an equal.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1c0d4411cdc9e15d262503ebb34514d1a4f4ab76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c0d4411cdc9e15d262503ebb34514d1a4f4ab76/0_0_3873_2904/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Celia &amp; Richard in 1993\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Celia and Richard in 1993.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Celia &amp; Richard Craig</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They enjoyed playing together and the conversation was easy and relaxed, but they kept it casual. \u201cWhen we first started seeing each other, we weren\u2019t taking it seriously, it was just a bit of fun. I wasn\u2019t looking for lifelong love or anything like that,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Although they share a passion for music, there are differences too. \u201c[He\u2019s] always been more of a scientific side of music and I\u2019m more of the touchy-feely, instinctive side of it,\u201d says Celia. \u201cSo I think I saw a bit of a jigsaw puzzle that fitted quite nicely there. He complemented what I was doing.\u201d He still does: \u201cThat\u2019s why Richard\u2019s my producer when I\u2019m making records because I trust what he\u2019s saying.\u201d</p> <p>After a year of study, Richard returned to Australia. When Celia came to visit, it was clear there was something special between them. But she had a place at the Royal Academy of Music for her postgraduate studies, so she returned to England. Richard wanted to follow but there was a complication. He could no longer apply for a working holiday visa; the only option was a marriage visa. And while they wanted to live together in the UK for a year first, he had to apply from Australia. So they decided to get married \u2013 he proposed on Valentine\u2019s Day and they had a country wedding in June.</p> <p>Although their decision was rushed, both knew it was something they intended to do. \u201cI\u2019m hopeless at making decisions like that. I would dilly-dally forever except for the practicalities that we couldn\u2019t be together unless we were married.\u201d says Richard. \u201cBut I knew that I enjoyed being with Celia and that we always had fun together, and so why not? I remember having that conversation with my parents: \u2018How can I ever make this decision?\u2019. My dad, he was a man of few words, looked at me with a wry little smile and said, \u2018Celia looks all right to me.\u2019 So I said, \u2018Oh, right. That\u2019s good enough for me then!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Celia felt the same way \u201cThere were lots of people buzzing around me saying, \u2018Are you sure?\u2019 I was 21 when we got engaged \u2026 I just always go with an instinct. I do everything like that, really. If it feels right then it\u2019s right, and it felt right, so I did it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/03/how-we-stay-together-i-dont-want-to-just-be-flatmates-its-got-to-be-more-than-that\">How we stay together: 'I don\u2019t want to just be flatmates.

Celia was offered a prestigious job in London and Richard supported her, but it took months to sell their home. So Celia commuted, staying in London for a few nights and then returning to the family in Wales each week. Eventually they moved to London but it continued to be a stressful juggling act, with Celia often touring around Europe leaving Richard at home with the children. \u201cEssentially I was a stay-at-home dad, and I was happy to do that,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019d been together 10 years before [their first child] and I was ready for kids long before Celia was.\u201d His wife was younger and ambitious and he was happy to support her. \u201cI really enjoyed being the father and supporting Celia as the breadwinner. I think you just have to be flexible and accept those changing roles as your circumstances change.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d27847e40b22de2f6370c166f539f9e9796a15b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d27847e40b22de2f6370c166f539f9e9796a15b4/0_224_4032_2800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Celia & Richard Craig on their wedding day in 1990\" width=\"1000\" height=\"694\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Celia and Richard Craig on their wedding day in 1990.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Celia &amp; Richard Craig</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Roles were reversed when they moved to Australia in 2006. It was a big decision, as Celia was in her dream job at the time, working as the chairman of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, playing the Last Night of the Proms and working with the London Symphony Orchestra. Still, when Richard said he wanted to go because his father was ill, she agreed. \u201cI suddenly thought, \u2018Actually, I have done everything that I wanted to do.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Neither had jobs or a home to go to. Fortunately the couple share an adventurous spirit. \u201cWe\u2019ve been quite heavy risk-takers in some ways because we didn\u2019t know how we were going to actually make a crust if we came to Australia. We just played it as it came,\u201d says Richard. Celia agrees: \u201cI like the risk-taking. I think it\u2019s an incredible adventure and it\u2019s the way to keep everything alive.\u201d They settled in the Blue Mountains and Richard set up his own business repairing musical instruments, while Celia looked after their children.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/26/how-we-stay-together-looking-after-each-other-everything-else-would-fall-into-place\">How we stay together: 'Looking after each other, everything else would fall into place'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Raising children together has been a challenge as they haven\u2019t always had the same approach, especially during the teenage years. \u201cThe kids have the potential to drive a wedge because they\u2019re always asking the other one for an opinion on that one, all the time: \u2018Oh, but Dad just said this.\u2019 All the time. So that\u2019s dangerous, but we got through it as well.\u201d Celia is a disciplinarian while Richard is gentler. That\u2019s been the cause of some of their few arguments, but they managed to navigate it.</p> <p>They\u2019ve learned a few things over the years. \u201c[Always] assume, when things get tough, that the other person is doing their best,\u201d says Celia. \u201cNot blaming each other for stuff ... I think we\u2019re quite good at seeing things from each other\u2019s point of view.\u201d She adds: \u201cThere\u2019s no point [getting into] dialogue that says, \u2018You always do this.\u2019 That kind of thing is completely pointless.\u201d</p> <p>Richard agrees: \u201cWe\u2019re always willing to step up to support each other in difficult times. I went through a terrible time when my dad died a couple of years ago. I knew that Celia was always there for that emotional support that I needed. Similarly, when she\u2019s gone through bad patches of being unhappy at work or whatever, you just make the commitment to be there for each other.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8aa24a8de5ce803d3d9d3f5527f1ad57cca674ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8aa24a8de5ce803d3d9d3f5527f1ad57cca674ad/0_0_1826_1201/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Craig family when they moved to Australia in 2006\" width=\"1000\" height=\"658\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Craig family when they moved to Australia in 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Celia &amp; Richard Craig</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s something else too, says Richard: \u201cWe still fancy each other.

The biggest hit to jobs was in the accommodation and food services industry, down 33.4% in the five-week period. Arts and recreation services were down 27%. Nearly a fifth of jobs held by people aged under 20 have vanished. Official job figures for April will be released on 14 May.</p> <p>About a quarter of all Australian workers are casuals, but it\u2019s uneven. The jobs with highest prevalence of casual employees are <a href=\"https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1718/CasualEmployeesAustralia\">hospitality workers (79%) and food preparation assistants (75%).</a></p> <p>Hutley says that while casual work suits some people such as students and gives flexibility to employers to scale their workforces up and down, employees had little real choice.

It wants an \u201cemergency income guarantee\u201d for everyone else at the minimum wage of $740 a week.</p> <p>\u201cThe system is broken and it\u2019s not good enough to patch it up and sail on through,\u201d he told Jacobin recently. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen these crises keep coming; after 2008\u20139, they said it was a once in 50-year thing. Ten years later, a pandemic knocked capitalism over very quickly. Just look at the way it is unfolding in the United States. And on top of it all, we\u2019ve got a climate crisis that keeps ratcheting up every year, which also threatens the system.\u201d</p> <p>An income guarantee such as this \u2013 whether temporary or not \u2013 comes close to the idea of a universal basic income (UBI), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/08/something-big-has-to-change-could-australia-afford-a-universal-basic-income\">increasingly debated</a> since the global financial crisis. The difference overall is that a UBI is paid to all without conditions, even to the wealthy (which is clawed back though taxes), whereas an income guarantee is paid to those without paid work.</p> <p>The idea is that the economic system now is incapable of providing all workers with a reasonably paid job.

In <strong>Afghanistan</strong> at least seven people were killed and more than a dozen injured when police opened fire on a protest against corruption in food distribution projects.</p> \n<p>In the <strong>US</strong>, the worst-hit country in the world, President Donald Trump claimed on Friday that Covid-19 would \u201cgo away without a vaccine\u201d, but also said he was expecting 95,000 or more deaths.</p> \n<p>His remarks came after a week of trauma in the country, which saw deaths top 77,000, unemployment rise to nearly 15% and the disease breach the inner circles of the White House, raising questions about the protection of top officials.</p> \n<p>The latest confirmed case was the US vice-president Mike Pence\u2019s press secretary, who is married to a key Trump aide, anti-immigration hardliner Stephen Miller. That news came the day after Trump\u2019s personal valet tested positive.</p> \n<p>Globally, Covid-19 has killed more than 275,000 people, and over 3.96 million infections have been confirmed. That total is likely to pass 4 million over the weekend, and does not include many people who have not been able to access testing.</p> \n<p><strong>Russia</strong> registered more than 10,000 new Covid-19 cases in the last day, the sixth in a row at that level. It is now the fifth-worst hit country, approaching nearly 200,000 confirmed infections. However, its death toll of 1,827 is far lower than in European countries with similar numbers of cases, including Italy, the UK, France and Spain.</p> \n<p>The crisis led the government in Moscow to cancel 9 May celebrations of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany. The festivities would have crowned a historic political season in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">Russia</a>, including a symbolic referendum to amend Russia\u2019s constitution and reset Putin\u2019s term limits, allowing him to remain in the Kremlin until 2036.</p> \n<p>Instead Putin is ruling from a bunker, as plummeting oil prices devastate the economy, and the crisis puts his political plans on hold. The day\u2019s festivities were moved mostly online, and a parade replaced by a flypast.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd428ebee444a2e1021c2ec2df7aa5c58f23afaa\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd428ebee444a2e1021c2ec2df7aa5c58f23afaa/0_150_4890_2933/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Large crowds gather for the Victory Day military parade in Minsk, Belarus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Large crowds gather for the Victory Day military parade in Minsk, Belarus.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tatyana Zenkovich/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>VE Day celebrations went ahead in <strong>Belarus</strong>, where president Alexander Lukashenko appeared to relish <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/09/victory-day-belarus-swaggers-on-parade-as-russians-leave-red-square-deserted\">upstaging Russia</a> and defying Moscow\u2019s warnings that its lax approach could \u201cbring a sharp increase in the number of those infected\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cLet the parade in Minsk today be the only one in the post-Soviet space,\u201d Lukashenko said. \u201cIt will be held in honour of all Soviet fighters who liberated the world from Nazism.\u201d</p> \n<p>The coronavirus crisis has inflamed US-<strong>China</strong> relations, with public disputes over the origin and handling of the pandemic exacerbated by other showdowns, including escalating restrictions on and expulsions of foreign journalists.</p> \n<p>Washington on Friday unveiled new rules that will require Chinese nationals working as journalists for non-US publications to<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-puts-new-limits-on-visas-for-chinese-journalists-11589005068\"> renew their visas every 90 days,</a> after Beijing forced US journalists working for prominent publications to leave China.</p> \n<p>Tensions are likely to rise further after leaders of the US congressional foreign affairs committee wrote to nearly 60 countries asking them to support <strong>Taiwan</strong>\u2019s participation in the World Health Organization.</p> \n<p>Taiwan is not a member of the United Nations and is excluded from the WHO because of Chinese objections; Beijing considers the self-ruled island a renegade province.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>It has been seeking to join a ministerial meeting this month of the WHO\u2019s decision-making body, the World Health Assembly, with backing from Washington and several US allies, citing the need for the broadest effort possible to fight the pandemic.</p> \n<p>In <strong>South Korea</strong>, measures to close nightlife venues in Seoul were imposed by mayor Park Won-soon, after 18 new cases were reported in the 24 hours to midnight on Friday, the Associated Press reported.</p> \n<p>South Korea at one point had the highest number of infections outside mainland China but a comprehensive testing programme and rigorous contact tracing allowed it to bring the virus under control while it proliferated elsewhere.

  "<p>Little Richard\u2019s Rip It Up entered the UK top 30, right at the bottom, in December 1956. It looked up at a chart that included Bill Haley and Elvis Presley, but was mostly filled with light opera gloop such as Malcolm Vaughan\u2019s St Therese of the Roses, three different versions of the cod-calypso of Cindy, Oh Cindy, and toddler-friendly novelties including Dickie Valentine\u2019s Christmas Island and Mitchell Torok\u2019s When Mexico Gave Up the Rhumba, while the spirit of the blitz lived on with Vera Lynn\u2019s A House With Love in It. Play any of these records either side of Rip It Up and the effects are guaranteed goosebumps, an involuntary laugh and real surprise. With the sheer volume of Richard\u2019s raw-throated scream \u2013 ebullient, gleeful, quite filthy \u2013 the shock of the new can still be felt. Rip It Up \u2013 that title alone!</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Think of Bowie. Think of Prince. Little Richard was doing the same thing \u2013 with greater extravagance \u2013 decades earlier</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>By the following March, he was a sensation in Britain, with three singles \u2013 Long Tall Sally, She\u2019s Got It, The Girl Can\u2019t Help It \u2013 in the top 20. The early rock\u2019n\u2019roll hits were all about teenage concerns: Elvis\u2019s were about sex, Bill Haley\u2019s were about dancing and Gene Vincent\u2019s were about menace, and all of them dropped in fashion references. But Little Richard\u2019s singles were unrelatable \u2013 they got by entirely on their freakish energy. Theoretically, the lyrics were about gals named Sue and Daisy, but something else was going on. Long Tall Sally was an almost monotone roar from the off, Richard\u2019s voice a Martian wail, and references to bald-headed Sally, Uncle John, and sneaking in and out of alleys weren\u2019t obvious Friday night knee-trembler material. Little Richard\u2019s music was omnisexual and alien. It broke down barriers that Britain\u2019s teenagers didn\u2019t even know existed.</p> \n<p>Of course, Richard Penniman\u2019s sonic impact was only part of his outrageous long-term cultural impact. An erotic wild man, a drag queen, with a pencil moustache and pancake makeup, he had no predecessors; no one was about to confuse him with Dickie Valentine. Think how far beyond description Prince and Bowie seemed at their point of breakthrough, then think how Richard Penniman was doing much the same \u2013 and with greater extravagance \u2013 two to three decades earlier.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqL_pinZVp8\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TqL_pinZVp8?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>James Brown adored Little Richard, mimicked his scream and his rhythmic whoops, although Richard would be the first to defer to Brown\u2019s dancing prowess. The sound and style of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/21/otis-redding-interview-rocks-back-pages-mr-cool-and-the-clique-from-memphis\">Otis Redding</a> \u2013 the second most famous son of Macon, Georgia \u2013 owed Richard everything. Later, there would be Sly Stone, Bootsy Collins, Janelle Mon\u00e1e. Beyond that, Slade\u2019s breakthrough hit, Get Down and Get With It, was a cover of Richard\u2019s UK-recorded 1967 single Get Down With It, and Noddy Holder\u2019s voice was a direct descendant. Led Zeppelin took the thundering drum intro to Rock and Roll from Richard\u2019s Keep A-Knockin\u2019. Elton John was a shy member of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jul/17/elton-john-interview\">Bluesology</a> when they supported Richard at London\u2019s Saville theatre in 1967 and saw the excitement generated by a peacock-plumaged star standing on top of a piano. When the Beatles supported Richard at the Tower Ballroom in the Merseyside resort of New Brighton in October 1962, he reportedly gave Paul McCartney tips on how to scream in tune; his advice would be put to good use on I\u2019m Down, Hey Jude, Maybe I\u2019m Amazed and other raucous Macca moments. </p> \n<p>The most remarkable thing about his influence is that Richard\u2019s time in the sun was so brief. After two years of raucous singles on the Specialty label, he released his first album, Here\u2019s Little Richard, in May 1957. That October, he announced his retirement from show business. Pop lost him to the church, and his records for the next five years were gospel \u2013 and dreary gospel at that. All momentum was lost, and he spent the rest of his career playing catch-up. </p> \n<p>You almost never hear them, but Little Richard did make good records \u2013 and some great records \u2013 after the 1950s. We can thank the impresario Don Arden for bringing him back into the fold.</p> \n<p>When Arden arranged for Richard to tour Britain in 1962, he was reportedly unaware that he was booking a gospel show. Richard appeared in an ecclesiastical cloak, accompanied by Billy Preston on church organ. Fortunately for Arden, the support act, Sam Cooke, drove the audience wild; Richard\u2019s competitive spirit overcame his godliness, and compelled him to play his hits so as not to be outshone. The gospel set lasted for all of one show. By 1964, Richard was back in the UK top 20 with Bama Lama Bama Loo, an obvious nod to his 50s hits, but strong enough to be a springboard for his comeback. He would remain a huge draw in concert, but there would be no more British hits, and Richard\u2019s subsequent recording career is hard to follow.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>He was the King of Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll. Every so often, he\u2019d feel the crown slip and make a little more noise</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>With judicious editing, you can avoid the re-recordings and budget compilations and realise that his discography didn\u2019t have to be so random and messy. As early as 1962, immediately after the Don Arden shows, he cut six secular sides under the group pseudonym the World Famous Upsetters so he wouldn\u2019t compromise his position in the church. One single emerged: a tough update of Fats Domino\u2019s I\u2019m in Love Again, backed by an intense and beautiful Every Night About This Time, which matched his very best 50s sides but was barely heard.</p> \n<p>The mid-60s soul era suited Richard\u2019s powerful voice to a T. One of his finest recordings was 1966\u2019s Dance A Go-Go (aka Dancing All Around the World). It matched the supercharged clanking backbeat of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/22/how-we-made-motown-records-berry-gordy-smokey-robinson-stevie-wonder-interview\">Smokey Robinson</a> and the Miracles\u2019 Going to a Go-Go to one of Richard\u2019s most ebullient vocals \u2013 he sounds like the happiest man alive. The song was only pressed as the B-side on promo copies of his deep soul ballad hit, Don Covay\u2019s I Don\u2019t Know What You\u2019ve Got (But It\u2019s Got Me). Almost no one heard it until the song turned up on compilations in the 70s. What a terrible waste.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Little Richard Spotify playlist\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:guardianmusic:playlist:4NZiVQrtIcGKVyby2z03g5\" width=\"300\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The fault for these missteps may well lie with Richard himself. Take the song I Don\u2019t Want To Discuss It \u2013 it has tricksy funk drumming allied with a flat-out northern beat, with Richard relatively restrained, but it works perfectly. Unfortunately, he hated it, and said he wanted to throw every brass instrument in the world \u2013 presumably with the exception of his signature honking sax \u2013 off a cliff. Give the people what they want: another cover album of 50s hits. Why need he bother with anything else? He was the King of Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll. Every so often, he\u2019d feel the crown slip and make a little more noise.</p> \n<p>There were two other lads on the comeback trail in the late 60s making the same claim. The trio may have been rival contenders for the title, but the mutual respect between Elvis Presley, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/08/jerry-lee-lewis-interview-heaven-hell\">Jerry Lee Lewis</a> and Little Richard was there on record \u2013 Elvis covered Richard (Rip It Up), Jerry Lee covered Richard (Jenny Jenny), and Richard covered Jerry Lee (Whole Lotta Shakin\u2019 Goin\u2019 On). The winner of this three-way tie was probably the singer who had never made the claim but simply let the public, and his record label, put the epithet out: Elvis became the King, no rock\u2019n\u2019roll qualifier needed.</p> \n<p>Unlike Lewis and Richard, Elvis\u2019s career sustained through the 60s. Even when he was cutting stinky soundtrack records, there was some sense of progress from his 50s recordings and his humility would pay dividends on the 1968 Singer Presents Elvis television comeback special, which gave his career a huge boost. Richard\u2019s career, meanwhile, felt like a neverending succession of comebacks.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>At a festival in 1969, John Lennon and Yoko Ono insisted on headlining and had the gall to play Little Richard's songs</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Why was this? One reason was that he had alienated a large part of his potential audience by refusing to play any kind of black awareness events. In any case, his existing audience was primarily white. Richard was never seen as a totem of the black community in the way that Joe Tex or James Brown were. Black radio stations tended to avoid him. Another reason was that he never stuck with a record label long enough for them to build a head of steam: in the 60s alone he recorded for End, Mercury, Atlantic, Specialty (a second stint with the label that broke him), Vee-Jay, Modern, Okeh, Brunswick and Reprise, where he settled for a record-breaking four years.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OfhmVmhL7s\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2OfhmVmhL7s?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>It wasn\u2019t as if there weren\u2019t opportunities for Richard to make it back to the top. At a festival in Toronto in 1969, John Lennon and Yoko Ono insisted on headlining, coming on after Little Richard, with the gall to include some of his songs in their set. Bumps Blackwell, who had produced those breakthrough singles for Richard in 1955, thought they were \u201crude\u201d. A riled Richard played an electrifying set. This followed fast on the heels of another festival in Atlantic City, at which he had upstaged Janis Joplin. Suddenly, with a return to rock roots pervading the charts \u2013 Creedence Clearwater Revival at one end of the spectrum, Sha Na Na at the other \u2013 Richard was in demand again.</p> \n<p>He still looked the part, too. People came expecting a wheezing man, someone as armchair-bound as Fats Domino, but he was as energetic and thrilling as he had been a dozen years earlier. Mo Ostin at Reprise signed him on the back of the Toronto show, and he quickly had an album (The Rill Thing) and a catchy new single (Freedom Blues) in the US charts.</p> \n<p>Richard went on to cut four albums for Reprise in the early 70s, a period of brief stability. For once, however \u2013 and this is surprising, given that they were at heart a supportive and understanding label \u2013 he had genuine cause to feel a grievance with the record company. Reprise gave him material by writers who had clearly been inspired by him (I Saw Her Standing There, Brown Sugar, Born on the Bayou), but it felt like an odd form of cap-doffing that often made for an unsatisfying end product. (Similarly, Reprise got Fats Domino to record Lady Madonna in 1968, a tribute to a tribute). Freedom Blues turned out to be another false dawn.</p> \n<p>Richard\u2019s biggest problems in the 1970s weren\u2019t record companies, but his drink and drug habits, which he later estimated cost him $1,000 a day. Larry Williams had begun in 1957 as a substitute Little Richard on Specialty with hits like Short Fat Fannie and Bony Moronie, before he turned provider \u2013 he wrote and produced Richard\u2019s terrific 1967 single I Need Love, with Commandments of Love on the flipside. By the 70s he was one of Richard\u2019s drug dealers, and allegedly called in a debt with a gun pointed at his mentor\u2019s head. While later laughing and claiming Williams loved him dearly, Richard was also certain Williams would have shot him if he hadn\u2019t stumped up the money on the spot. That was one of several dreadful episodes to befall the singer in 1977 \u2013 the murders of two close friends, the accidental shooting death of his nephew and his brother\u2019s fatal heart attack \u2013 that sent him back into the arms of the church. Most likely, he\u2019d have died the same year had he not changed his ways.</p> \n<p>To all intents and purposes, this was the end of Little Richard\u2019s career. Everything from this point on was built on the existing Richard persona, and that all too brief run of 50s hits. He would make regular appearances on stage and on chatshows, and would occasionally guest on the unlikeliest record. In 1990, Living Colour\u2019s Elvis Is Dead saw him briefly and thrillingly try his hand at rap: \u201cTo all you pimps making money on his name \u2026 don\u2019t you feel ashamed? Be my guest and let him rest!\u201d. He had nothing left to prove, after all. He had done more to break down racial and sexual barriers than almost any artist in the 20th century, and his greatest recordings are imperishable. We were lucky to have him, and he knew it. He was the beautiful Little Richard from Macon, Georgia, an ultra-sexual force of anti-nature, the king of rock\u2019n\u2019roll.</p>",

Van den Hauwe comes racing in, but Molby turns and knocks the ball past him, into the wide open space the right-back had vacated. What vision! Whelan romps into acres down the inside left, past the naughty blue balloon, and checks infield. Dalglish makes a run across him and to the left, and wants the ball; he\u2019d be free in the box if Whelan plays the reverse pass. But Rush is sailing in from the right, and Whelan curls a perfect diagonal looper over Ratcliffe, the ball dropping gently at the feet of the striker.

But he takes a careless touch and decides to pass inside to Lawrenson, who is immediately plunged into a world of pain. Bracewell is on him in a flash, nipping the ball away from behind and allowing Sheedy to take up possession. He bursts into the box to the right of the D. He\u2019s one on one with Grobbelaar, though Hansen is doing his best to shepherd him further right. Sheedy goes for the top left, but his shot across the keeper is always curling away from goal. Inches wide of the left-hand post. A foot the other way and Grobbelaar wasn\u2019t getting to that.

But he\u2019s uncharacteristically ponderous and ends up with his feet in a tangle. And a manic minute ends with another opportunity for Dalglish, who slashes a wild shot left after Rush tees him up just inside the area.

Everton 1-0 Liverpool (Lineker 28)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Liverpool attempt to launch an increasingly rare sortie into enemy territory. Bad idea! They\u2019ve been rope-a-doped! Molby picks up a loose ball 40 yards out and rolls forward to Dalglish, whose control lets him down terribly. He attempts to ping one to Johnston but only finds Reid, who takes one touch and then quarterbacks long down the middle for Lineker, on last-man Hansen\u2019s left shoulder. It\u2019s a perfectly weighted pass that allows Lineker to take the ball in his stride, get a yard ahead of Hansen, and fire towards the bottom right. Grobbelaar does well to get down and save, but the ball squirts to the right, and Lineker is perfectly placed to dink the rebound home with Hansen flat-footed and the keeper prone! That, it is safe to say, had been coming.

That looked extremely close, with Van den Hauwe almost certainly playing Dalglish on from a deep position on the opposite flank. Whether Dalglish would have finished the job had play been waved on is another argument; Ratcliffe got back and buzzed around him after the whistle, and Dalglish\u2019s eventual shot was deflected out for what would have been a corner. We\u2019ll never know how that would have panned out if play remained live.

And here\u2019s another poser, as Stevens flings a long throw into the Liverpool box from the right. Grobbelaar comes out to claim in his trademark flamboyant style, but flaps under pressure from Sharp and Hansen is forced to lash clear.

Reid pokes it through, but it\u2019s a little bit weak and gives Lawrenson the opportunity to extend his leg as far as it\u2019ll go and poke out for a corner. That was a delightful sequence by Everton, and a little more juice on the final pass would have sent Lineker clear. The resulting corner is an opportunity for Grobbelaar to showcase his juggling skills, plucking the ball from atop Sharp\u2019s neep and Harlem Globetrotting for a couple of seconds.

He feeds Stevens on the outside. Stevens swings in a stunning cross. It\u2019s over the heads of Lawrenson and Hansen. Grobbelaar starts to come, then stalls. Sharp goes up to meet it, eight yards out, but just as he\u2019s preparing to dispatch a header into the net, he\u2019s clipped in mid-air by Nicol\u2019s right leg! That\u2019s a clear penalty ... but it\u2019s not awarded. Sharp races after referee Alan Robinson in an apoplectic rage. Liverpool have got away with one, and it\u2019s a biggie.

The league championship in 1985! The club\u2019s first European prize, the Cup Winners\u2019 Cup, the same year! They\u2019ve been the best team in England for a while now.</p> <p><strong>Plenty of success, yet they could have had a whole lot more. </strong>Liverpool rode their luck in the Milk Cup final of 1984. The ten men of Manchester United snatched the FA Cup and a Double from their grasp this time last year. Then there was this season\u2019s title race ... well, did anyone think, when Everton won at Anfield in late February to go eight points clear of their stuttering neighbours with just a dozen games to go, that Kenny Dalglish\u2019s side was capable of putting together a scarcely believable winning run to snatch the prize? Everton can be forgiven for wondering what the hell\u2019s just hit them.</p> <p><strong>Thing is, this isn\u2019t a vintage Liverpool side. </strong>But when you\u2019ve set such lofty standards over the years, you can string together 11 wins and a draw in your last 12 matches, pip your city rivals to the league championship, and still find folk picking fault. It\u2019s the nature of the beast. But if they were to win the first ever all-Mersey FA Cup final and become only the fifth team in history to win the famous Double ... well, that\u2019s something that eluded the truly great teams built by Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley, and we\u2019d be forced into an instant root-and-branch reassessment of this current crop.</p> <p><strong>Everton will have other ideas. </strong>Having missed out on the league, and the chance of a Double of their own, they\u2019ll be desperate to stop a season of wild dreams turning into a nightmare. If this match was being played three months ago, they\u2019d be hot favourites. As it is, with Liverpool now in ominous form and high on success, it\u2019s far too close to call.

  "<p>It\u2019s a good principle that, except in exceptional circumstances, architecture critics see the buildings that they review. You wouldn\u2019t want a food critic to recommend a restaurant based on photographs of loaded plates, nor a theatre critic to base their judgments on films of performances. You\u2019re meant to sniff, feel and sense the things you describe, to experience them in the round.</p> <p>There\u2019s a downside to this good principle, which is that buildings don\u2019t come to you, and that many fine works are done all over the world which it would be absurdly expensive and eco-reckless to visit. Circumstances are, what\u2019s more, what can only be described as exceptional. Given that almost everywhere is now almost equally inaccessible, whether another county or another continent, I\u2019ve decided to make an opportunity out of a problem, and to offer a world tour of the very best new architecture, as seen through the portal of a laptop.</p> <p>It helps that there are several websites \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/\">Dezeen</a>, <a href=\"https://www.archdaily.com/\">ArchDaily</a>, <a href=\"https://www.designboom.com/\">Designboom</a>, <a href=\"https://archinect.com/\">Archinect</a>, or the pickier <a href=\"https://www.domusweb.it/en.html\">Domusweb</a>, <a href=\"https://archpaper.com/\">Archpaper</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.architectural-review.com/special-subscription-offers?gclid=Cj0KCQjw-r71BRDuARIsAB7i_QMIkLpJHzW8Ir4FQ0nBVuFaUSRyjz2CUj8wjbXnlXOq644UP-M2f8AaAhEpEALw_wcB\">Architectural Review</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wallpaper.com/\">Wallpaper*</a> \u2013 that daily display new architectural gems sent to them by hopeful practices. I therefore propose a top 10 of the hundreds that have been published on these sites in the time of Covid-19. The start of this period is tricky to define, but let\u2019s say it was early March, which was when it dawned that this is a truly worldwide crisis.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The best of these projects are theatres for life, wherever it might take place</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s a varied harvest. There are attention-seekers and duds among those hundreds of projects. There are a few ambulance-chasers \u2013 those who seek to promote themselves by proposing their very own architectural responses to emergencies, responses for which nobody asked. But there is also the never-ending desire of architects to discover in every building project the chance to make the world a little more interesting and a little more enjoyable. The best of these projects are theatres for life, whether that life is seeing art, living in your home, going to school or meeting friends, and wherever it might take place: in an ancient city, in a refugee camp, in deep countryside. They aim to make that life richer, fuller and more surprising.</p> <p>A few things stand out. One is the quality of work in places not traditionally seen as architectural powerhouses, such as Vietnam, Lebanon, Bangladesh and Paraguay. There is a related lack of really big names, the Dutch <a href=\"https://www.mvrdv.nl/\">MVRDV</a> being the best known to make the list. There\u2019s no single dominating style, although it is somewhat amazing how prevalent is a version of modernism that first matured some time in the middle of the last century \u2013 one that favours undecorated but textured surfaces like timber and rough concrete, sculpted into plain but sometimes complex forms.</p> <p>There\u2019s a good side to the persistence of this style \u2013 if it ain\u2019t broke why fix it? \u2013 but it leaves you wondering why this century doesn\u2019t have more to add. You are also grateful for those works that offer something else entirely: the self-indulgent but entertaining <a href=\"https://www.vensvanbelle.be/#alex\">guesthouse Alex</a>, for example, or the bamboo-built safe space. In some of the choices there\u2019s a certain attraction to the creative reuse of wrecked old buildings. This ruinlust might betray a personal preference, but it also reveals some architects\u2019 move away from the making of brand new magic objects towards the mining of the already-there.</p> <p>There are hazards in this operation. It\u2019s hard to tell at a distance if a building presents an ugly backside to its neighbours, or if there are catastrophic details out of sight of the camera. Did the budgets spiral out of control? Did any of these marvels reduce their clients or builders to sobbing wrecks? Are those humanitarian projects actually diverting resources from more essential but less photogenic purposes? I\u2019ll guess not, but it\u2019s difficult to know for sure.</p> <p>Mostly, it\u2019s heartening. There\u2019s energy and invention out there, plus the ability to respond to unusual and challenging situations. Which are qualities we will all need, whenever we are allowed out in public again.</p> <h2>Rowan Moore\u2019s top 10 new architecture projects (in no particular order)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47d80ee9a25abffc6de0d212e1d636b7b9fd77ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47d80ee9a25abffc6de0d212e1d636b7b9fd77ad/0_0_4992_4184/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Museum of Contemporary Art Helga de Alvear, C\u00e1ceres, Spain, by Emilio Tu\u00f1\u00f3n.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"838\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Stillness meets movement\u2019: Emilio Tu\u00f1\u00f3n\u2019s Museum of Contemporary Art Helga de Alvear in C\u00e1ceres, Spain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alberto Amores + Pancho Matienzo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.archdaily.com/936426/museum-of-contemporary-art-helga-de-alvear-emilio-tunon-arquitectos\">Museum of Contemporary Art Helga de Alvear, C\u00e1ceres, Spain, by Emilio Tu\u00f1\u00f3n</a><br></strong>On the one hand there\u2019s the stately rhythm of white pillars, which speak of temple-like repose. On the other there\u2019s an intricate series of steps and terraces, both inside and out, that work their way up, around and through the building, such that it grows out of the hilly city around it. Stillness meets movement, in other words. Closer examination reveals other nuances: the concrete verticals narrow as they get higher, and what at first sight seem rectangular rooms are skewed into parallelograms.

It\u2019s a nice meditation on shelter, on inside and outside, and on the passage of time. It makes a spatial adventure out of living in a house.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ced6bbd1f10c629a17f11c6ae5ec92d929d9c7d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ced6bbd1f10c629a17f11c6ae5ec92d929d9c7d4/0_0_8687_5791/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alex\u2019s guesthouse by Atelier Vens Vanbelle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The \u2018self-indulgent but entertaining\u2019 guesthouse for Alex.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Van de Velde</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.vensvanbelle.be/#alex\">Alex\u2019s guesthouse, Berlare, Belgium, by Atelier Vens Vanbelle</a><br></strong>This Belgian folly, built for a client in the film industry, has the three-dimensional joy that tends to get squeezed out of larger projects. The timber interior seems hewn and cave-like. The rust-coloured exterior, with a little periscopic tower, looks like a beached submarine. A basement mini-cinema, in homage to <em>Twin Peaks</em>, has a red curtain. It runs several gamuts \u2013 from earth to sky, from homely to weird, from natural to artificial \u2013 which is a lot for a little building.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c71113488717a7bdfbf81b07ff3e4c2b40fc827b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c71113488717a7bdfbf81b07ff3e4c2b40fc827b/0_0_2482_3097/801.jpg\" alt=\"Stone Garden, Beirut (Dorell Ghotmeh Tane Architects/ Lina Ghotmeh \u2013 Architecture).

What makes the Stone Garden interesting is its sharp angles, derived from its tight urban site, plus its earthy, striated external finish, plus its cliff-like form, plus the sense its deep-set windows give that this is a building inhabited by actual people, not just glass-sheathed real estate. So it is mineral-urban-geometric all at once, with the vegetation, like city-sized parsley or coriander, providing a nice garnish.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ca0bb5087018d4fb180875ff1b4caaea7b2048c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ca0bb5087018d4fb180875ff1b4caaea7b2048c/0_0_5371_7827/686.jpg\" alt=\"The B\u00f3 Mon preschool.\" width=\"686\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Charming and deft\u2019: the B\u00f3 Mon preschool.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Trieu Chien</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.archdaily.com/city/tu-nang\">B\u00f3 Mon preschool, T\u00fa Nang, Vietnam, by Kientruc O</a><br></strong>It\u2019s a simple enough idea: a big distinctive roof that casts a big distinctive shadow that moves around during the course of the day. So the shadow becomes an animated thing in its own right, not just the absence of sun. The curvy shapes might be said to have some harmony with the surrounding hills. A tree is hugged at the entrance. The corrugated metal construction is basic, with some sensible-looking devices to ensure ventilation. Charming and deft and does what it says on the tin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9521f4c0bb1b304bc62a8ede813b41176cb15b92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9521f4c0bb1b304bc62a8ede813b41176cb15b92/0_0_2880_2663/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The \u201cemergency scenery\u201d designed by unparelld\u2019arquitectes in Olot, Spain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"925\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The \u201cemergency scenery\u201d designed by unparelld\u2019arquitectes in Olot, Spain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jose Hevia</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/2020/05/04/unparelldarquitectes-emergency-scenery-olot-spain-archiecture/\">Emergency Scenery, Olot, Spain, by unparelld\u2019arquitectes</a><br></strong>On a raw spot left by the demolition of a house, a triple arch of skinny grandeur is created, like a secular version of a church portico. It combines solid and thin materials, and reused and new. There\u2019s not much you can do with it, apart from sit or perform on its stone steps. It depends on its power of proposition: it suggests that the little square that it faces is a place where something or other of interest \u2013 quite what remains to be discovered \u2013 might happen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85a9bd2dc705ffb8ac44eee8172d9d323441a68d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85a9bd2dc705ffb8ac44eee8172d9d323441a68d/0_0_2880_4319/667.jpg\" alt=\"Equipo de Arquitectura\u2019s UHP synagogue in Asunci\u00f3n.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Equipo de Arquitectura\u2019s UHP synagogue in Asunci\u00f3n.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leonardo M\u00e9ndez</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.equipodearquitectura.com.py/proyectos/concurso-sinagoga-uhp/\">UHP synagogue, Asunci\u00f3n, Paraguay, by Equipo de Arquitectura</a><br></strong>Like many projects that adorn the architectural internet, this synagogue uses the motifs and strategies developed by mid-century modernists 70 years ago. But the architects wield these familiar tools with skill and sense, using concrete, rusty metal and reddish timber to effect the transition from robust exterior to reflective interior. Light is filtered through screens or descends from above. The ceremonial space envelops the congregation with wooden walls and ceiling that are also poised and geometrical. It gives the impression, at least from 6,000 miles away, of a warm if formal hug.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3fb433e56bfd62ebc1bedc1794caa26ac9df7562\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3fb433e56bfd62ebc1bedc1794caa26ac9df7562/0_0_4986_3418/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fass school.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"686\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Full of delights\u2026 Toshiko Mori\u2019s Fass school.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Iwan Baan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/the-toshiko-mori-architect-designed-elementary-school-opens-in-dakar-senegal\">Fass school and teachers\u2019 residence, Fass, Senegal, by Toshiko Mori</a><br></strong>It\u2019s doughnut-shaped and made of local natural materials, and so might be compared to the Rohingya safe space, but there the likenesses end.

Its geometry has some twists: the roof varies in dimension and elevation, for example, around its elliptical orbit.

  "<p>Relieved Indians are arriving at airports across the country on the first flights to bring home those stranded abroad, and others are en route on naval warships, in an extensive repatriation effort labelled the <em>vande mataram</em> (long live the motherland) mission.</p> <p>Photos from inside a plane landing at Chennai airport showed the flight crew, who were tested for Covid-19 beforehand, wearing protective suits and smiling behind masks and visors.</p> <p>Thousands of Indians have been stuck abroad since India banned all incoming flights in late March as part of a strict lockdown, which has been extended three times. </p> <p>Students in the UK and the US ran out of money for food and workers in the Gulf who had lost jobs had no money on which to survive. Indians who were abroad for diagnosis or medical treatment found themselves stuck there for much longer than planned, without enough money to continue paying bills.</p> <p>Every day for a week, eight or nine flights run by Air India will carry passengers home from 12 countries, mainly from the Gulf but also from the US, UK, Russia, Bangladesh, Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines.</p> <p>Each flight will carry 200-250 passengers, to allow for physical distancing. Anyone who shows symptoms during the flight will be confined to a separate area.</p> <p>Anshul Sheoran, the pilot of a flight that landed in Kochi, Kerala, from Abu Dhabi, told the media that doctors had trained him and the crew on protocols to be followed. \u201cThey taught us the correct ways of donning and doffing the PPE suits. We were told about the loopholes and the wrong practices. Wearing the suits meant we could not use the lavatory or eat during the flight,\u201d Sheoran said.</p> <p>Three of India\u2019s naval warships have been deployed for the rescue operation. A naval official said one ship was on the way from Male, the capital of the Maldives, carrying nearly 700 Indians.</p> <p>The government said those being brought home first had been selected on the basis of how urgent their need was to return, with priority given to those facing deportation, pregnant women, elderly people, students in difficulties with no income and those with medical emergencies.</p> <p>The number of Indians to be repatriated over the coming weeks may be as high as 200,000.</p> <p>The smiling faces of those returning home on planes presented a stark contrast with the migrant labourers who have been enduring their own \u201cinternal exile\u201d in Indian cities during the lockdown.</p> <p>Without jobs or income, they have also been desperate to return to their villages and families but have received little or no help from the government. So far only a few thousand have been able to go home on special trains.</p> <p>Hundreds of thousands are still waiting in shelters. Many have given up waiting for the government to provide transport and are walking home. They are covering distances of hundreds of miles while carrying young children and their meagre belongings in summer temperatures of 40C (104F).</p> <p>On Friday a goods train ran over 16 labourers who were walking more than 500 miles to their homes in Madhya Pradesh and had stopped to rest on the railway tracks.</p>",
  "<p>On a stretcher lies a patient; his ashen face protrudes from under a green blanket, eyes closed. Two uniformed women carry the stretcher, wearing face masks. It looks as if it\u2019s a lovely day: the sun is shining, the shadows dark, the sky blue. But this is not a happy picture. Is the casualty even alive, or has he already been taken by the killer virus that has wrapped itself around our planet like a python, squeezing the life from it?</p> <p>The photograph was taken at an ambulance station in Washington DC. Within the past couple of months? It could have been, if it weren\u2019t for the uniforms (I don\u2019t think today\u2019s nurses wear lace-up leather boots) and the stretcher. In fact, it was taken more than a century ago, in 1918, during the Spanish flu epidemic, which killed so many millions. The photographer is unknown, forgotten.

And she colours them, digitally.</p> <p>We\u2019ll come back to the process.

When she was 12, she had a blog and wanted to add some graphics. She didn\u2019t know how, nor did she know anyone who could help. So, using YouTube tutorials, she taught herself to use Photoshop, which she has been exploring ever since.</p> <p>A degree in international relations was abandoned; it didn\u2019t excite her. But her mother is a historian and Amaral has always been fascinated by the past. After stumbling across an online collection of colourised photographs of the second world war, she decided to have a go herself. Sourcing pictures from free image libraries, she developed her own Photoshop techniques and published the results on Facebook and Twitter, where she soon gained large followings. That\u2019s where Dan Jones came across her. The historian saw what she had done to a <a href=\"https://marinamaral.com/portfolio/lewis-powell/\" title=\"\">photograph of Lewis Powell</a>, one of the men executed in 1865 for conspiring to assassinate Abraham Lincoln, his vice-president and the secretary of state (Amaral transformed Powell from a nondescript 19th-century Confederate soldier into a smouldering James Dean). Jones got in touch, the rest is\u2026 well, you know what.

Historical research is the most important part of the process. \u201cBefore I sit down and start colourising a photo, I will analyse it deeply, often with the help of historians and experts, gathering as much detail and information as possible and cross-referencing it all with visual and written descriptions of the time. I have to dig to find pieces of a puzzle and fill in the gaps.\u201d</p> <p>The process can be time-consuming, depending on the number of details and the complexity of the image. \u201cI will spend hours, days or weeks working on a single photo. There are some that do not work in colour for various reasons \u2013 maybe the original was damaged, or it just doesn\u2019t look right \u2013 so then we have to discard it and start again. It\u2019s important to have an artistic eye, otherwise the photograph will not look real.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes, the result looks less like a picture taken in the last couple of months and more like one painted centuries ago. Her colourised photograph of the Russian dancer <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ida-Rubinstein\" title=\"\">Ida Rubinstein</a> volunteering as a nurse in Paris at the start of the first world war, has something of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/29/jan-van-eyck-arnolfini-portrait-make-art-come-alive\" title=\"\">Van Eyck\u2019s Arnolfini Portrait</a> about it.</p> <p>The most powerful of the 200 photographs in the book are not the loudest ones: the action, horror, the famous and infamous faces. I\u2019m not sure what it adds to know that the hole in Mussolini\u2019s head leaked what looks like pink blancmange on to the body of his girlfriend, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Petacci\" title=\"\">Claretta Petacci</a>. Robert F Sargent\u2019s famous D-day photograph, <a href=\"https://www.visitthecapitol.gov/exhibitions/artifact/jaws-death-photograph-d-day-normandy-landing-robert-f-sargent-june-6-1944\" title=\"\">Into The Jaws Of Death</a>, of American soldiers disembarking on Omaha beach, is powerful in colour \u2013 but no more so than it is in black and white. More startling is another landing craft photo, of US troops in Operation Torch, the 1942 invasion of North Africa, because this one was taken <a href=\"http://ww2today.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Torch-landing-craft.jpg\" title=\"\">into the faces of the soldiers</a>. One face in particular: a blue-eyed boy who looks about 15, stares into the camera. Is that fear? What happened to him, you wonder? What was his name?</p> <p>For me, Amaral\u2019s colourisation process is most moving when applied to pictures of children. The addition of eye colour, skin tone, freckles \u2013 suddenly, they look like children you might know. And children, especially, relate to her colourised pictures because they are witnessing a reality that is more similar to their own, she says. Amaral\u2019s day is made when teachers email to say her work has helped their history classes, or engaged their students more.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5ba44c5f4ad3c15f0570882da3530560840f005\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5ba44c5f4ad3c15f0570882da3530560840f005/0_0_2958_1359/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A triple head shot of 14-year-old Czeslawa Kwoka, photographed at Auschwitz\" width=\"1000\" height=\"459\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s very powerful in black and white\u2019: 14-year-old Czeslawa Kwoka, photographed at Auschwitz...</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Auschwitz Memorial and Museum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"21e8bf216042f99e3ad85aeeeff1390b4b00cde9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21e8bf216042f99e3ad85aeeeff1390b4b00cde9/0_0_2741_1193/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A triple head shot of 14-year-old Czeslawa Kwoka, photographed at Auschwitz: black and white image coloured by artist Marina Amaral\" width=\"1000\" height=\"435\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Czeslawa Kwoka, 14, photographed at Auschwitz.

He is surrounded by a group of adoring boys. They are mostly very fair, and one is wearing lederhosen; otherwise, they could be the scout group that meets down the road. They are all members of the Hitler Youth.</p> <p>But the most haunting picture shows another child, 14-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/27/the-holocaust-is-not-your-metaphor-to-use-in-modern-political-debates\" title=\"\">Czeslawa Kwoka</a>, who was murdered at Auschwitz. It was, Amaral says, one of the most difficult pictures she\u2019s worked on. \u201cIt\u2019s very powerful in black and white, but in colour you can see that her lips are bleeding. She had just been beaten by a guard. You can really see the fear in her eyes, but you can also feel her courage. Colour allows us to understand the reality in a much deeper sense.\u201d</p> <p>The photograph of Czeslawa Kwoka is also part of a special project Amaral is involved in, <a href=\"https://facesofauschwitz.com/\" title=\"\">Faces Of Auschwitz</a>, a collaboration with the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum, for which she is colourising registration photographs from the museum\u2019s archive. It\u2019s the hardest work she has done, she says: \u201cBut I think it\u2019s also necessary. They send me the pictures but also the documents, so I have to spend hours looking at their faces, knowing that, after the photo was taken, they were murdered. I need to have that feeling, otherwise I will be transformed into a machine and the whole purpose will be lost.\u201d</p> <p>Amaral knows that colourisation isn\u2019t for everyone. Some see it as ersatz or interfering, even sacrilege. But it isn\u2019t a matter of choosing one or the other, she says. \u201cMy intention is not to replace the original, but to give people the opportunity to see history from a different perspective.\u201d Also to see it more as the photographer saw it, and the way it actually was. The photographer might not have had the choice, or the technology, to take a picture in colour. But looking through the viewfinder, that\u2019s what they saw; the past \u2013 even its grimmest, darkest hours \u2013 was not in black and white.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://headofzeus.com/books/9781789542028\" title=\"\">The World Aflame</a>, by Marina Amaral and Dan Jones, is published by Head of Zeus on 14 May at \u00a325.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 10 May 2020.

He believes players and clubs could have sacrificed another week of training as a team to ensure these loose ends in the biosecurity guidelines were tied up.</p> \n  <p>Should the NRL decide to bow to government pressure and enact a \u2018no jab, no play\u2019 policy, Graham says players will need to consider the strength of their convictions against their livelihoods.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I know for me, if I don\u2019t like a flu jab, if it puts my livelihood at risk preventing me from making some money to feed my family, I\u2019m getting the flu jab.</p> \n   <p>It\u2019s simple in my eyes ...

<div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Opposition Leader <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> has accused the federal government of lacking an economic plan to go with its road map to lift coronavirus-related restrictions.</p> \n  <p>AAP reports:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>\u201cWe have said there needs to be a full release of the budget outlook, something the government is ducking at this stage,\u201d Mr Albanese told reporters in Queanbeyan on Saturday, campaigning in the Eden-Monaro electorate ahead of the by-election.</p> \n   <p>He said the government\u2019s promise of a \u201csnap back\u201d in the economy once the crisis has passed is nothing more than \u201ca marketing slogan from the prime minister who doesn\u2019t have economic plan\u201d.</p> \n   <p>\u201cWe will be calling for the government to outline its economic plan.\u201d</p> \n   <p>Albanese said there is a \u201cbig threat\u201d to the economy if people suddenly get cut off from their jobkeeper and jobseeker payments on some arbitrary date.</p> \n   <p>Prime minister <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> and state and territory leaders agreed on Friday to a three-step plan to restart business and community activities.</p> \n   <p>However, the states and territories are set to move through the three stages at different speeds, depending on their health situation and local conditions.</p> \n   <p>Treasury says it is possible to restore 851,000 jobs in coming months if things go to plan.</p> \n   <p>The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said regional and interstate travel restrictions need to be lifted as soon as is practicable to breathe life back into regional and urban economies.</p> \n   <p>\u201cAustralian businesses depend on operating as seamlessly as possible between states and territories, as many supply services and source goods interstate,\u201d ACCI CEO, <strong>James Pearson</strong>, said in a statement.</p> \n   <p>\u201cWe recognise state and territory-specific timetables for the three-stage plan will be based on the current pandemic impact trend and will be subject to any change in health outcomes and ongoing reviews. We hope there are no significant detours or U-turns on the road to recovery.</p> \n   <p>The Business Council of Australia has set up a series of expert working groups, headed by some of the country\u2019s top executives, to identify practical and achievable solutions to create jobs and boost the economy.</p> \n   <p>The groups will not only look at how to restart business and industry but put in place structural reforms to drive growth and higher wages.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44b3b6dd7da30378bed4c88d878e87f2bea84f03\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44b3b6dd7da30378bed4c88d878e87f2bea84f03/0_397_6048_3627/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Opposition leader Anthony Albanese speaks during a press conference in Queanbeyan, 9 May 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Opposition leader Anthony Albanese speaks during a press conference in Queanbeyan, 9 May 2020.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-09T04:14:05.872Z\">at 5.14am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb623858f08c0a2409ba883\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-09T03:35:24.774Z\">4.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Good afternoon, it\u2019s Elias Visontay here.

(Cognisant that last week the federal education minister <strong>Dan Tehan</strong> similarly attacked Andrews \u2013 over school closures \u2013 and then was forced to rapidly apologise).</p> \n  <p>I\u2019m going to run Wilson\u2019s quote in full so readers can make up their own minds. He was speaking on ABC TV with WA Labor member <strong>Josh Wilson</strong> (the member for Fremantle, no relation (<em>at least I don\u2019t think so!</em>) about different states easing restrictions at different times.</p> \n  <p><strong>Tim Wilson</strong>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m a federalist and I believe that we should have local laws reflecting local conditions. But the other reason is because it puts the burden and responsibility on the states to actually explain why they\u2019ve taken the different approaches. Now, they\u2019re taking the point that Josh [Wilson] has just raised \u2013 you know, WA has done things differently. They let kids go back to school earlier, whereas Victoria is saying no. The burden and the responsibility then has to be on Dan Andrews, when other states are allowing people to go and visit their mums on Mother\u2019s Day, why can\u2019t we go and visit in Victoria, our mums on Mother\u2019s Day? Why can\u2019t we send our kids to school? Why are businesses being unnecessarily punished longer than in other states? And he has to come out and articulate that case and take responsibility for it.</p> \n   <p>I\u2019ve just outlined some serious questions I think that Dan Andrews needs to answer for Victorians, if he wants to maintain public confidence. <strong>Because I think ... and there is actually now a narrative that\u2019s building in parts of Victoria where people are increasingly concerned that he\u2019s probably enjoying the </strong><strong>clampdown too much in terms of the authority and power it\u2019s given him</strong>, <strong>and he\u2019s not as enthusiastic to roll it back.</strong> </p> \n   <p>So, people will have their own opinions.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Wilson later went on to say he was reflecting the sentiments expressed on the front page of the <strong>Herald Sun</strong> as evidence of the \u201cnarrative\u201d he was referring to.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I made the observation of what\u2019s in the Victorian press, and you need to actually go and read the Victorian press. I understand in WA that may not be the case, but the front page of the Herald Sun today is very clear, wanting to understand the rationale, the reasoning, behind why Dan Andrews is not reopening Victoria as other states are doing.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But there are three words at the beginning of that key sentence: \u201c<strong>Because I think.</strong>\u201d</p> \n  <p>Victoria has the second-highest total of Covid-19 cases in the country (1,468) behind only NSW.</p> \n  <p>Andrews said on Thursday:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Nobody is enjoying these settings, I understand that, but it is ... important to stay the course on this, not just to do what we want to do, but to do what is ... in the interests of every single Victorian family, every single Victorian business.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And yesterday: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I can tell you what I will be doing on Mother\u2019s Day, I will not be visiting my mum. She is in good health, but has underlying health issues. I just wouldn\u2019t do it. I would very much like to.</p> \n   <p>These are unprecedented times. We are all doing things very differently.

  "<p>When Kate Milman was 21, she paused her English degree at the University of East Anglia to join <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/jan/23/the-newbury-bypass-protest-of-1996-in-pictures\" title=\"\">protests against the Newbury bypass</a>. It was 1996, and the road was being carved out through idyllic wooded countryside in Berkshire. She took up residence in a treehouse, in the path of the bulldozers, and lived there for months. It was a revelation. She lived intimately with the catkins, the calling birds, the slow-slow-fast change in the seasons. Despite being in a precarious position as a protester, she felt completely safe and her brain was calmed.</p> <p>\u201cYou know when you go camping and go back to your house, and everything feels wrong? The lighting is harsh and everything seems complicated indoors. It just got under my skin, this feeling \u2013 that [living in the woods] is like being at home.\u201d</p> <p>Finally, however, she was evicted from her forest heartland. The men and their machines arrived beneath her tree. Kate was arrested under a newly created \u201caggravated trespass\u201d law and barred from joining the protests again. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/24/newbury-protest-camp-bypass-legacy\" title=\"\">The wood was ripped apart</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThat level of grief \u2013 it felt like losing somebody,\u201d Kate says now. It was a highly complex woodland and she had come to know it intimately. \u201cI knew how beautiful it was at dawn and at full moon, and then it was bulldozed. When you watch that amount of stupidity, when you have that much grief and impotence, what can you do with it?\u201d</p> <p>The idea for <a href=\"https://wildthings.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Wild Things</a>, a workers\u2019 cooperative set up to provide children with experience of the natural world, was born. For three days each week, she and her fellow co-op members, Kath, Kat and Nick (her partner), provide half-day sessions for groups of nine pupils from various city schools.</p> <p>I\u2019ve come to a Wild Things day at Bestwood Country Park, a hilltop woodland on the edge of Nottingham. The wind runs through the canopy in waves, worrying the leaves, but it is calm and snug in the green, brambly understorey. The slender trunks of silver birches shine in the low sunlight.</p> <p>We are both layered in the warm, shapeless garb of the forest school practitioner. From the moment formal, government-provided schooling began in the Victorian era, dissenters have championed alternative forms of education based outdoors, which have placed the health and creativity of the child at their heart. \u201cForest school\u201d, a specific type of outdoor schooling with an emphasis on imaginative play in a forest setting and a fire circle, developed in Britain in the 1990s after teachers visited outdoor schools in Denmark. It has flourished in the last two decades without state support, as parents react against the rigid, test-based learning imposed by government reforms and the national curriculum.</p> <p>When I talk to people about forest schooling, everyone agrees that it\u2019s very important to help children \u201cconnect\u201d with the natural world. But, they often say, it\u2019s terribly middle class and white, isn\u2019t it?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b587ac9ab82d28dca697545d834ee841f55cbae4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b587ac9ab82d28dca697545d834ee841f55cbae4/0_0_2947_2947/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children's hands holding jay feathers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jay feathers discovered in the woods.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wild Things</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The children we\u2019re with today are mostly 10-year-olds, members of an \u201cEnglish as a second language\u201d group from Forest Fields primary and nursery school. The school\u2019s bucolic name belies its location in central Nottingham. Its 620 children speak 52 languages. Everyone in today\u2019s group arrived in Britain in the last two years. Several started school only two months ago. They are from Pakistan, Afghanistan, Romania and Syria, and some came from refugee camps. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what they\u2019ve seen,\u201d says their teaching assistant, Yasmin Khaliq, who speaks five languages. She has been bringing groups to Wild Things for nine years. \u201cIt\u2019s a godsend,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s all outdoors, they are seeing things with their own eyes, there\u2019s no language barrier.\u201d</p> <p>From somewhere above us comes the anxious \u201ccheeeept-cheeept\u201d of a great spotted woodpecker. Then another call, carried on the wind. \u201cKooooo-eeeeeeeeee!\u201d</p> <p>Kate replies, with a completely unexpected volume: \u201cKooooo-eeeeeeeeee!\u201d</p> <p>The children have been allowed to run ahead, alone, through the woods, and they follow the sound of Kate\u2019s call. I hear the heaving of a small pair of lungs before I see the boy, Mohammad, a slim child bent double with effort, legs flying out sideways like a skittish calf, eager to win his personal race. Next up the hill is a tiny, beaming Syrian girl. \u201cI\u2019m Amira, but you can call me Lion,\u201d she grins.</p> <p>All nine children are effervescent. I can\u2019t banish the image of a group of puppies, bouncing around outdoors for the first time. Kate and I walk to the Wild Things base camp. The children scamper ahead, shimmying around brambles, poking around the site with the sharp-eyed curiosity of chickens, investigating branches, tree stumps and some interesting-looking clippers laid out on a tarpaulin.</p> <p>On the days Kate doesn\u2019t take children on camps, she \u201cscrats around\u201d for charitable funding because, mostly, the only way to get pupils from cash-strapped state schools into the woods is to offer the sessions free. The Wild Things staff survive on a minuscule co-op \u201cshare\u201d wage. Kate lives with Nick and their eight-year-old son in a small rural housing co-op. They drive a battered high-top Transit stuffed with bow saws, loppers, clippers, ropes, tarpaulins, plastic mugs, hot chocolate and other essentials such as children\u2019s wellies and woollen gloves: the pupils rarely bring clothes suitable for outdoors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"17a0ce9c99f9b6bc326f7d48b37bb305d5138d8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17a0ce9c99f9b6bc326f7d48b37bb305d5138d8d/0_206_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A boy running on a path through the wood in Bestwood Country Park, Nottingham that the Wild Things Forest School uses as its classroom\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Children need to feel liberated and free.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The children sit round the fire circle while Kate, Kath and Kat (\u201cthe three Ks\u201d) show them how to use loppers and saws, and explain today\u2019s activities. The pupils choose their own adventure. This child-led approach is intended to offer an alternative to conventional didactic, adult-led education, which misses \u201cthat whole chunk of experience where children are just getting to be a wild animal\u201d, Kate says. Ten-year-olds \u201care at that stage of development where they need to feel liberated and free\u201d.</p> <p>Today the children can learn to use bows and arrows, build a fire and cook on it, or lay a trail, hide and have another group track them down. The activities, says Kate when we break for lunch, are really giving them an excuse to mooch and dream in the forest. No two children respond to the place in the same way. Kate and her colleagues are constantly surprised by the infinite span of children\u2019s creative thought and their willingness to express it in the woods: one boy decides to build a gym, another a mask; a girl spins stories \u2013 about a frog and a turtle crossing her path.</p> <p>I join Kat and a trio of girls \u2013 keen little Amira; Homa, a Pakistani girl; and Cristina, a Roma Gypsy from Romania with a long plait, who wears a purple jumpsuit and a shiny purple padded jacket. She can\u2019t speak much English but understands plenty.</p> <p>Our mission is to lay a trail of arrows made from sticks through the wood to a spot where we will hide from the other members of the group.</p> <p>\u201cLike da?\u201d says Cristina, fashioning an arrow from three large branches.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Children can feel at home in the woods in a way they find more difficult in the community they have landed in</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cMake it smaller?\u201d suggests Kat.</p> <p>\u201cNo. Big!\u201d says Cristina.</p> <p>Cristina gasps as we twist along a narrow path, passing a tree stump covered in gleaming bracket fungus. Beech leaves shine luminous orange on the forest floor. \u201cCome on, guys!\u201d says Cristina. Last week she didn\u2019t talk at all, says Kat.</p> <p>I struggle to break a large stick into arrow pieces. Homa laughs: \u201cCristina is stronger than you,\u201d she says.</p> <p>I assumed that most refugees have come to the UK from cities, but Wild Things has worked with many migrant children who grew up in rural areas. Meanwhile British-born city children belong to a country called Indoors: they ask Kate, \u201cWhat\u2019s mud?\u201d or, \u201cWhy are there so many trees here?\u201d It is often only in Britain that rural children from overseas are confined to city-centre flats. Their questions \u2013 \u201cAre there elephants?\u201d or, \u201cAre there deadly snakes here?\u201d \u2013 are rooted in experience of their countries of origin. For many, Kate says, the woods awaken lost memories and a yearning for home. \u201cAs soon as we light a fire, they say, \u2018Ah, I know this\u2019 or they point to a plant and get really animated. They are in their element.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b58c5d380f381eca58dccf211c6c93fa88687d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b58c5d380f381eca58dccf211c6c93fa88687d4/0_120_4032_2904/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children setting off on a tracking hunt at a Wild Things forest school\" width=\"1000\" height=\"720\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Setting off on a tracking hunt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wild Things</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One group last spring included a partially sighted girl. \u201cWalking up into the woods, she stopped and said, \u2018Listen to that sound!\u2019\u201d remembers Kate. \u201cIt was the buzzing of the insects.\u201d It reminded the girl of her former country. At the end of her six weeks, she said, \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve come home.\u201d The Wild Things staff frequently hear similar declarations. \u201cOften children can feel at home in the woods in a way they find more difficult in the community they have landed in, where technology is everything, money is everything, they are at the bottom of the pecking order and there are massive tensions in the area. In the woods they are on a level playing field. They can just be kids again.\u201d</p> <p>We return to the fire circle and the children discuss their plans for next week.</p> <p>\u201cMake a wood house,\u201d says Sanaya. \u201cI made a house with sticks in Pakistan. My grandma makes a fire like this.\u201d</p> <p>It reminds her of home? \u201cYes.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We help a child to fall in love with nature and we don\u2019t know if they will ever be able to access it again</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What is the best thing about the wood? \u201cEverything,\u201d says Homa. \u201cHide-and-seek, the fire, the bread, because that makes us all hot.\u201d</p> <p>This prompts Adnan to reminisce about Syria. \u201cI used to like playing with my cousins. It was just like this but with less trees.\u201d</p> <p>Cristina is the most reluctant to leave.</p> <p>\u201cNext time, again?\u201d she asks Kate, looking worried. Kate counts on her fingers to show Cristina seven days.</p> <p>Cristina\u2019s face lengthens at the prospect of such a long wait, but she joins the rest of the group hurtling back down the hill to their minibus heading for the city, and their new homes.</p> <p>Kate and her fellow Wild Things workers often feel the weight of the children\u2019s longing to stay in the woods. \u201cThey constantly say things like, \u2018I feel so free out here,\u2019\u201d she says. Already today, on her second of six sessions, Sanaya was saying, \u201cI know I won\u2019t come back because my family haven\u2019t got a car.\u201d After the six weeks, Wild Things give every child a leaflet with bus routes, showing how they can reach the forest from Nottingham. But the bus drops them in the nearest village, and there\u2019s no cafe in the woods. It will be a very strong-willed 10-year-old who makes her own way here, and an act of faith for her parents to follow her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ac7478e7897d2a8317a3c7ccc476246c95b971f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ac7478e7897d2a8317a3c7ccc476246c95b971f/0_37_4032_2599/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children share treasures back at camp at a Wild Things forest school\" width=\"1000\" height=\"645\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sharing treasures back at camp.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wild Things</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wild Things know their work enhances the children\u2019s lives but, as Kate points out, \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to measure improvements in confidence, self-esteem, friendships, behaviour. Sometimes you do see something tangible, other times you don\u2019t. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s not happening.\u201d</p> <p>Forest school is still relatively new, educational research is poorly funded and a child\u2019s achievement is shaped by myriad circumstances that make it difficult for academics to control for every confounding factor. But there is an enormous weight of scientific research demonstrating the benefits of wild green space for adult mental and physical wellbeing, and a growing body of evidence pointing to the specific benefits of outdoor schooling.</p> <p>The physical gains are easiest to measure. In one study, <a href=\"https://www.owlscotland.org/images/uploads/resources/files/Physical_Activity_at_Forest_School_Research.pdf\" title=\"\">a group of Scottish nine-</a><a href=\"https://www.owlscotland.org/images/uploads/resources/files/Physical_Activity_at_Forest_School_Research.pdf\" title=\"\">11-year-olds were fitted with accelerometers</a> to measure their physical activity during a typical school day and during a day at forest school. These revealed that activity levels were 2.2 times greater during forest school days than on normal school days that included PE lessons, and 2.7 times greater than on \u201cinactive\u201d school days. Scandinavian studies of outdoor schools have also found they improve children\u2019s attentiveness. In 2017, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272494417300737\" title=\"\">a four-year study from Norway</a> identified more inattention and hyperactivity symptoms the less time children spent at an outdoor preschool.</p> <p>Perhaps most surprisingly, there is also hard evidence that outdoor schooling can produce better academic outcomes. A <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03004430.2018.1446430\" title=\"\">three-year study of primary school pupils</a> who were \u201cstruggling to thrive\u201d found a group who attended weekly forest school sessions achieved better overall attendance than their primary school-only peers, and markedly better attainment. The forest school pupils\u2019 writing improved by 18% compared with 7% among comparably disadvantaged pupils; reading improved by 27%, compared with 22% among school-only children; and maths attainment rose by 27% compared with 11%.</p> <p>Even so, forest school teachers are acutely aware that they offer only a tiny taste of magic in childhoods where more time is spent indoors than in any preceding generation. \u201cWe help a child to fall in love with nature and we don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll ever be able to access it again,\u201d Kate says. She thinks for a moment. At least the children now know the woods are there. The place may call to them at any point in the future. \u201cIt\u2019s better to know there\u2019s a bit missing. It might be something you can use in your later life,\u201d she says. \u201cTo know that the woods can make you feel better.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Some names have been changed. </p> <p>Wild Child by Patrick Barkham is published by Granta at \u00a316.99.

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Global Covid-19 cases approach 4 million</h2> <p>Global coronavirus cases stand at 3,937,813, according to the Johns Hopkins tracker, with global deaths at 276,863. The US has the most fatalities, at 77,179, followed by the UK (31,316) and Italy (30,201). On Friday, Russia recorded 10,000 new cases for the sixth day in a row.</p> <h2>IMF downbeat on global economic forecast</h2> <p>The head of the International Monetary Fund has suggested global economic forecasts could be revised down, and warned the United States and China against rekindling a trade war that could weaken a recovery. Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF\u2019s managing director, said recent economic data for many countries was coming in below the fund\u2019s already pessimistic forecast for a 3% contraction in 2020.</p> <p>On the same day, the US accused China and Russia of cooperating to spread false narratives about the coronavirus, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/09/coronavirus-live-news-global-cases-approach-4-million-trump-us-unemployment-covid-19-lockdown-uk-italy-russia?page=with:block-5eb60d778f08c0a2409ba840#block-5eb60d778f08c0a2409ba840\">tightened visa guidelines</a> for Chinese journalists.</p> <h2>Travellers arriving in Britain to face two weeks of self-isolation</h2> <p>Travellers to the UK will be quarantined for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/09/two-week-coronavirus-quarantine-to-be-announced-for-uk-arrivals\">two weeks when they arrive</a> as part of measures to prevent a second peak of the coronavirus pandemic, Boris Johnson is expected to say on Sunday when he lays out his roadmap out of the lockdown. He will announce the introduction of quarantine measures for people who arrive at airports, ports and Eurostar train stations, including for Britons returning from abroad.</p> <h2>Trump says virus will \u2018go away without a vaccine\u2019</h2> <p>Donald Trump has said the coronavirus is \u201cgoing to go away <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/08/coronavirus-live-news-trump-cdc-guidance-russia-germany-france-brazil-who-190000-could-die-in-africa?page=with:block-5eb5a6d68f08c0a2409ba688#block-5eb5a6d68f08c0a2409ba688\">without a vaccine</a>\u201d, but warned there could be \u201cflare ups\u201d next year. Speaking to Republican lawmakers, he also said the US death toll could top 95,000. His vice president Mike Pence\u2019s press secretary, who is married to one of Donald Trump\u2019s senior advisers, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/coronavirus-outbreak-us-trump-pence-press-secretary\">tested positive for coronavirus</a>. She is the second White House staffer to test positive this week.</p> <h2>US lawmakers urge support for Taiwan at WHO</h2> <p>The leaders of US congressional foreign affairs committees have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/09/coronavirus-live-news-global-cases-approach-4-million-trump-us-unemployment-covid-19-lockdown-uk-italy-russia?page=with:block-5eb6048c8f0858b1a8106d28#block-5eb6048c8f0858b1a8106d28\">written to more than 50 countries</a> asking them to support Taiwan\u2019s inclusion in the World Health Organization. Taiwan, which is not a member of the United Nations, has been excluded from the WHO, which is a UN agency, due to objections from China. The letter was sent to \u201clike-minded\u201d countries, large and small, seen as friends and allies of Taiwan, including Canada, Thailand, Japan, Germany, Britain, Saudi Arabia and Australia.</p> <h2>Mexico looks to reopen its economy</h2> <p>Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Friday that he aims to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/09/coronavirus-live-news-global-cases-approach-4-million-trump-us-unemployment-covid-19-lockdown-uk-italy-russia?page=with:block-5eb608588f08464cd4296f3e#block-5eb608588f08464cd4296f3e\">present plans next week to reopen the economy</a>, as key sectors like car-making look to begin business again after over a month of quarantine measures. Industry sources say 18 May is seen as the tentative date for reopening the automotive sector in Mexico, provided it gets a green light from president Lopez Obrador.</p> <h2>Argentina extends quarantine for Buenos Aires</h2> <p>Argentina confirmed it will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/09/coronavirus-live-news-global-cases-approach-4-million-trump-us-unemployment-covid-19-lockdown-uk-italy-russia?page=with:block-5eb5ff688f08464cd4296f20#block-5eb5ff688f08464cd4296f20\">extend a quarantine covering its capital Buenos Aires</a> but relax restrictions in the rest of the country. The national quarantine South America\u2019s second largest economy began on 20 March and will be extended in the capital until 24 May. Until Friday, the country had registered 5,611 confirmed cases of the virus and 293 deaths.</p> <h2>Brazil\u2019s President Bolsonaro must \u2018drastically change course\u2019, says The Lancet</h2> <p>The British medical journal The Lancett says<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/09/brazils-president-bolsonaro-must-drastically-change-course-on-covid-19-says-the-lancet\"> the biggest threat to Brazil\u2019s ability to successfully combat the spread of the coronavirus</a> and tackle the unfolding public health crisis is the country\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro. Its editorial said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/brazil-scales-back-environmental-enforcement-coronavirus-outbreak-deforestation\">his disregard for and flouting of lockdown measures</a> was sowing confusion across Brazil, which reported a record number of Covid-19 deaths on Friday.</p> <h2>Roy Horn, of the double act Siegfried and Roy, dies</h2> <p>Roy Horn, of the Las Vegas double act Siegfried and Roy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/may/09/roy-horn-of-las-vegass-famous-siegfried-and-roy-act-dies-from-covid-19\">has died after contracting Covid-19</a>.

Thank you, Ireland, for showing solidarity and being here for us,\u201d wrote Vanessa Tully, another organiser.</p> <p>Adversity often brings out the best in people, the Choctaw tribe said in a statement. \u201cWe are gratified \u2013 and perhaps not at all surprised \u2013 to learn of the assistance our special friends, the Irish, are giving to the Navajo and Hopi nations. Our word for their selfless act is \u2018iyyikowa\u2019 \u2013 it means serving those in need.\u201d</p> <p>The Choctaw and Irish had become kindred spirits since the potato famine, the tribe said. \u201cWe hope the Irish, Navajo and Hopi peoples develop lasting friendships, as we have.

  "<h2>The rolling succession of a stream in Wales</h2> <p>It is a place I\u2019d discovered before the virus: a left-hand bend in a narrow stream, a couple of steps off the footpath. There is nothing remarkable there, or not at first glance. There are breeze blocks in the stream bed and plastic bags deeply embedded in the roots of an alder tree. With a few variations, it could be anywhere in Britain: the neglected corner of a city park, the back of a private garden, behind a national park cafe. It\u2019s just one of those spots that no one ever thinks to stop at and, if not for Covid-19, I would not have begun visiting daily, pausing for a few breaths before continuing. I saw the first snowdrops appear there, followed by primroses; then they were swamped by wild garlic and wood anemone. One morning a weasel shot out of a hole under a root and sprinted up the opposite bank. It was the first of several surprises.</p> <p>I have never experienced a spring like this one: the first season in 38 years that I\u2019ve stopped travelling and stayed, more or less, in one place. This spring, I realise, is the first to unfold before me in its entirety. And the world, having noticed that I\u2019ve given up travelling, has started to travel past me. It is, I reckon, a kind of exploration, the kind done at the extreme outer limits of slow travel.</p> <p>It was when the <a href=\"https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/wildlife-explorer/wildflowers/wood-anemone\">wood anemones </a>appeared that I first checked the identity of the plant. I was fairly sure, but not entirely. Wildflowers are like bird songs to me: I identify them, then faster than they can fade away, I forget. This year I am determined to halt this habit. I downloaded the <a href=\"https://www.picturethisai.com/\">Picture This</a> app and have never looked back. Simply take a picture of the flower with the app and wait for the identification.</p> <p>The primroses and wood anemones are still flowering as I write, but others have stepped forward and taken the limelight. Wild garlic grabbed me by the nose, then came celandine, jack-in-the hedge, red campion, violet and speedwell. The gentle succession is what has astonished me: how one morning, quite abruptly, a new species seems to have completely taken over, only to be superseded within days by another. This morning cow parsley came flouncing on to the stage and shouted down the stitchwort. And away in the wings, in the shadows, there are cameo appearances going on that I would have missed in previous years: the satin purple of vetches and early orchids.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38d6be6fcbd8557c00edde856670bfbf0ce7bdce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38d6be6fcbd8557c00edde856670bfbf0ce7bdce/0_103_3772_2265/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The sparrowhawk is the bird of prey you\u2019re most likely to spot in your garden.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The sparrowhawk is the bird of prey you\u2019re most likely to spot in your garden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Markus Varesvuo/Getty Images/Nature Picture Library</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I am not the only one to be experiencing this unexpected lockdown bonus: watching the world on its journey past my eyes, a world refreshed and reoxygenated by a reduced human presence. In York, ornithologist and wildlife expert <a href=\"http://www.yorkshirecoastnature.co.uk/blog/426/the-dandy-highwayman\">Richard Baines</a> has noted that a reduction in council mowing of road verges has unleashed clouds of butterflies feeding on flowers not yet mown down. \u201cOn one short walk up my road,\u201d he tells me over the phone, \u201cI spotted 33 butterflies \u2013 far more than I\u2019d expect at this time of year.\u201d<br></p> <p>For ecologist <a href=\"http://www.woldecology.co.uk/\">Dan Lombard</a> in Scarborough, lockdown has been a revelation. \u201cI\u2019ve discovered several species of bird migrating over my house at night,\u201d he tells me. \u201cLast night I heard sandpiper, moorhens, coots and redshanks.\u201d His daily walk has also revealed a field on the edge of town where endangered ring ouzels gather. \u201cI\u2019d never have found that if not for the lockdown.\u201d He is also busy doing moth, insect and bat counts. One unexpected benefit of confining wildlife enthusiasts to their homes, he reckons, is going to be a massive upsurge in useful data.</p> <p>Will Scott, an ecology student at Lincoln, has also found new insights through simply revisiting local walks. \u201cI\u2019m noticing changes in bird numbers that I\u2019d never have seen without the lockdown.\u201d One highlight was a night recording of a bittern over his house.</p> <p>For me, it\u2019s the sheer joy of observing the rolling succession of life: as each day goes by, something new will happen. Choose your spot. Take notes. Download the apps and get the guides. And the changes are occurring inside you too. One morning a shadow swept across the grass under me and I glanced up to see a sparrowhawk. Afterwards I realised I had looked immediately towards the right spot: some deep instinctive calculation of solar angles had occurred that I know, for sure, would not have happened a year ago.

Passing that familiar bend in the stream, I saw that the roots of the alder, the lines in the water, were red. Were they always red? Had I just noticed? Then a movement caught my eye on a tiny bed of shingle over which a few inches of water was rippling. It looked like an eel, but peering closely I saw seven tiny dots along the head rather than gills. This was a lamprey. Famously, Henry I supposedly died after eating \u201ca surfeit\u201d of them, although his were probably the much larger sea lamprey.</p> <p>As I watched more appeared and started writhing together in the shingle, sending up little clouds of silt. They were spawning. Next day they were at it again. The following day they were gone and I\u2019ve not seen them since. Presumably, in that innocuous and inconspicuous patch of shingle, right beside the breeze block and the plastic bag, the next generation of this rare jawless fish are now readying themselves for hatching and their own journey.<br><strong>Kevin Rushby</strong></p> <h2>Lessons from the Cairngorms in Edinburgh</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e407a487c1e140c283b10c9571d096195d73c38\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e407a487c1e140c283b10c9571d096195d73c38/0_0_5184_3186/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stuart Kenny in his local Edinburgh park\" width=\"1000\" height=\"615\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stuart Kenny in his local Edinburgh park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Grant Robertson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Weeks into lockdown and my envy for those with a garden has grown like mould under a kitchen sink. I am based in a second-floor flat in Edinburgh, with only the windows for fresh air and no flora or fauna except for a trio of cacti and an uncatchable kitchen mouse.</p> <p>All things considered I\u2019m still lucky, with a lovely park five minutes\u2019 walk away on the edge of the canal, and a great local bookshop still doing deliveries.</p> <p>So I read nature books to escape, and walk in the park once a day to get a breath of fresh air. My latest book is Nan Shepherd\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/20/living-mountain-nan-shepherd-review\">The Living Mountain</a> \u2013 the Scottish writer\u2019s legendary geo-poetic epic and love letter to the Cairngorm mountains where, over the course of her life, she spent hundreds of days hiking.</p> <p>On the first page, Nan sets out to \u201cknow the essential nature\u201d of the mountain, acknowledging: \u201cThis is not done easily nor in an hour. It is a tale too slow for the impatience of our age, not of immediate enough import for its desperate problems.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a remarkable sentence, particularly given that Nan was writing of the \u201cimpatience\u201d of the late 1940s, half a century before smartphones or social media declared war on the public attention span. How rare a thing it is in the era of fast travel for someone to truly know any patch of land, anywhere in the world, in the way that Nan Shepherd knew her Cairngorms.</p> <p>The Living Mountain is a book that teaches patience in a landscape. Acutely detailed but never exclusionary or gatekeeping, Nan describes the changing of the seasons in humble, unpretentious fashion. She uses her curiosity as a vehicle to investigate both the mountain and her own position within it. \u201cThat it was a traffic of love is sufficiently clear,\u201d she writes, \u201cbut love pursued with fervour is one of the roads to knowledge.\u201d</p> <p>Many of us might walk in local nature spots regularly but dismiss, or not even consider, their beauty, having seen far greener grass or grander mountains elsewhere. Now that we are being forced to re-explore these spots by the restrictions of our coronavirus lockdown, it\u2019s the perfect time to find these \u201cdoorstep adventures\u201d, to rediscover the local.</p> <p>So it is with this eye that I have taken to my daily walks in the local park, however modest they may be compared with a hike in the Cairngorms. I have realised that, like many, I know little of the birds that call there, or of the specifics of its trees or plants. But I have become a budding birdwatcher and can now separate the calls of bullfinch and chaffinch. Inspired by Nan\u2019s message that \u201ceach of the senses is a way in to what the mountain has to give\u201d, I have begun noticing scents around the park, and touching the fallen petals of the cherry blossom. I\u2019m finding a new peace, free from the anxiety of the daily news cycle.</p> <p>Nan writes that there \u201cis no getting accustomed\u201d to her mountains. Let\u2019s face it, there <em>is</em> getting accustomed to a local park, but there has never been a better time to become reacquainted with a park, a garden, a river or whatever you have on your doorstep. The Living Mountain is testament to the value in knowing what bird\u2019s call is waking you up in the morning or what flowers and trees are endemic to your area. That value comes in the form of connectivity, and at a time of such national anxiety and widespread isolation, the value of that connectivity should not be underestimated.</p> <p>In the conclusion to The Living Mountain, Nan notes that she has begun to \u201cdiscover the mountain in itself.\u201d She writes: \u201cThis process has taken many years and is not yet complete\u2026 The thing to be known grows with the knowing.\u201d I\u2019m trying to use my daily walks to know even a little more about the nature around me.<br>\u2022 <em>The Living Mountain (Canongate Books, \u00a39.99) is available at <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-living-mountain-9780857861832.html\">Guardian Bookshop</a> for \u00a38.89 excluding p&amp;p </em><br><strong>Stuart Kenny</strong></p> <h2>Skylarks and speedwell on the South Downs</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47c05aee895c05af220f7f508a8180722c83bd7f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47c05aee895c05af220f7f508a8180722c83bd7f/0_0_4896_3672/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dixe Wills on the South Downs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dixe Wills on the South Downs</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lying in the sun beside a river, bored to tears, academic and amateur poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/dec/20/birds-in-a-cage-derek-niemann-review\">John Buxton</a> noticed a family of redstarts flying through a wood. The moment sparked an epiphany: henceforth he would devote himself to the study of this colourful migrant songbird and write up his findings. There may seem little remarkable about this but for one thing: Buxton had been captured while serving with the commandos in Norway and was now a prisoner of war.</p> <p>Undeterred by his lack of binoculars, ornithological books and even paper (he wrote many of his observations on cigarette packets), Buxton threw himself into the task. During stints at two camps in Bavaria, he and fellow prisoners would spend countless hours watching the birds, their vigils interrupted only by meals and interminable roll calls.</p> <p>The result was Buxton\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Redstart-New-Naturalist-Monograph/dp/B0000CHLOR\">The Redstart</a>, published in 1950 and widely recognised as not only a classic work of nature writing but the definitive book on the subject. Perhaps just as importantly, the author\u2019s intense connection with <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/wildlife-guides/bird-a-z/redstart/\">redstarts</a> had offered him a means of escape both mentally and spiritually during his long years ofconfinement. \u201cOne of the chief joys of watching them in prison,\u201d he wrote of the birds, \u201cwas that they inhabited another world than I.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b1c148ff8d623363ce9323bf9ff23ccdbbd1063\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b1c148ff8d623363ce9323bf9ff23ccdbbd1063/0_0_4896_3672/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wildflowers on the South Downs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wildflowers on the South Downs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dixe Wills</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While today\u2019s lockdown can hardly be compared to the privations of wartime prison camp life, the notion that we too can escape through close observation of the natural world in our vicinity still holds true.<br><br>Having moved last year from the inner city to the South Downs national park, I\u2019m keenly aware of how fortunate I am to be able to cycle from my home up on to green hills in a matter of minutes. I pack a flask of tea for me and a little hip-flask of sugar-water in case I come across an exhausted bee (in my experience there\u2019s no human interaction with the insect world quite so satisfying as nursing an ailing bee) and climb the thigh-testing slopes. My goal is a spot beside a bridleway crossing a tract of exposed and wind-scoured arable land.<br><br>In fine weather, my chosen patch provides views across an undulating ridge to gleaming chalk cliffs and a hazy sea beyond. But I\u2019m more intent on looking down, for the subjects of my survey (one very much humbler than Buxton\u2019s) are below me: the wildflowers in a wide field margin. With just a handful of species \u2013 plantains, red campion, vetch and ox-eye daisies predominate \u2013 this highly regulated concession to nature has little of the romantic chaos of a meadow. However, I\u2019ve found great pleasure noting down the doings of individual plants week by week.</p> <p>While one prospers and blooms, another\u2019s withered leaves cry up to the skies to end April\u2019s unfamiliar drought, and a third defies the odds with its dogged colonisation of soil as hard as stone. And then last week came an unexpected delight: a cheeky unauthorised sprig of speedwell carving out a space below sheltering brambles.</p> <p>There may be no redstarts up here, but my inspections of this small swath of downland are accompanied by the almost constant trilling of skylarks. Numbers of this bird have declined alarmingly in Britain, and their spiralling song seems charged with a reckless hopefulness I can\u2019t help but admire.<br><strong>Dixe Wills</strong></p>",
  "<p>It was a grim irony that the best transport news in ages was buried in the first few days of the coronavirus lockdown. On 26 March, the government published a document, <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/878642/decarbonising-transport-setting-the-challenge.pdf\">Decarbonising Transport</a>, which went further in facing up to the problem of emissions from air and vehicle traffic than most campaigners had dared to hope for.</p> <p>The challenge is enormous. In 2016, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/20/the-guardian-view-on-transport-emissions-the-trouble-with-planes-and-automobiles\">transport overtook energy</a> to become the single biggest source of domestic emissions. Motor vehicles on their own are responsible for around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/16/uk-road-transport-emissions-up-since-1990-despite-efficiency-drive\">a fifth</a> of the total. On aviation, the UK is the world\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.tourismdashboard.org/explore-the-data/carbon-emissions/\">third-worst polluter</a>, behind China and the US.</p> <p>But here was the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52064509\">declaring that</a> \u201cpublic transport and active travel will be the natural first choice\u201d, adding \u201cwe will use our cars less\u201d for anyone who missed the point. Transport was to be a centrepiece of the UK\u2019s preparations for the postponed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/uk-likely-to-postpone-cop26-un-climate-talks-glasgow-coronavirus\">Cop26 climate talks</a>. Finally, it appeared we were on the way to grasping the nettle of our polluting driving and flying habits.</p> <p>Six weeks on, we are in a different world. Travel of all sorts has collapsed: there were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/apr/19/air-traffic-before-after-europe-coronavirus-lockdowns-video\">90% fewer flights</a> from European airports in April compared with a year ago. In the UK there are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/rail-journeys-at-5-of-normal-levels-as-uk-stays-home-due-to-coronavirus\">just 5%</a> of the normal number of rail journeys, while road traffic has fallen to levels <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/03/uk-road-travel-falls-to-1955-levels-as-covid-19-lockdown-takes-hold-coronavirus-traffic\">last seen in 1955</a>. In the short-term, this means steep drops in emissions: one estimate says the UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-carbon-emissions-fall-by-more-than-a-third-in-lockdown-11983721\">have fallen by 36%</a>. But already experts are warning that unless <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/financial-help-for-airlines-should-come-with-strict-climate-conditions\">strong action is taken</a>, any temporary benefits could be quickly erased. </p> <p>Probably the biggest risk is that governments will take their eye off the climate emergency, bailing out airlines and car manufacturers as they have already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/financial-help-for-airlines-should-come-with-strict-climate-conditions\">bailed out oil companies</a>. But while some observers have pointed to the collapse in vehicle sales as the beginning of the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200429-are-we-witnessing-the-death-of-the-car\">end for petrol and diesel</a>, other voices warn of the even greater risk to public transport due to worries over being able to maintain social distancing. Last month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/milan-seeks-to-prevent-post-crisis-return-of-traffic-pollution\">Milan\u2019s leaders declared</a> their determination to avoid a surge in car use, even if residents were reluctant to return to trains, trams and buses. \u201cIf everybody drives, there is no space for people, there is no space to move,\u201d said the city\u2019s deputy mayor Marco Granelli.</p> <p>Milan\u2019s authorities are among the leaders of a group of mayors working together worldwide on plans for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/01/city-leaders-aim-to-shape-green-recovery-from-coronavirus-crisis\">green recovery</a>. At the heart of schemes announced so far is a radical reorientation of street space in favour of walking and cycling \u2013 a goal that is made all the more urgent given the tentative links being made by researchers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/is-air-pollution-making-the-coronavirus-pandemic-even-more-deadly\">between air pollution and coronavirus</a>. Milan has announced that 35km (22 miles) of road will be transformed over the summer. In Paris, the mayor is spending \u20ac300m (\u00a3262m) on a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/carltonreid/2020/04/22/paris-to-create-650-kilometers-of-pop-up-corona-cycleways-for-post-lockdown-travel/#7c382e3354d4\">new cycle network</a>. New York, Mexico City, Bogot\u00e1 and Barcelona are among other cities with schemes ranging from new car-free days to the temporary reclassification of streets as recreation areas.</p> <p>So what of the UK? While it is only fair to point out that the country has been a leader on decarbonisation (after doing so much to carbonise the planet in the first place), when it comes to transport we are a laggard. For a mixture of reasons (powerful oil companies; successful car manufacturers; an unhealthy identification, nourished by popular culture, with the car-mad US), we have been painfully slow to take even obvious steps. Hence our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/01/air-pollution-falling-london-millions-still-exposed\">illegally dirty air</a>, astronomical rail fares and irrational hostility to cyclists \u2013 who are routinely pilloried for the kinds of selfish, careless behaviour that goes unremarked when the culprits are drivers.</p> <p>All is not lost, as March\u2019s draft decarbonisation document showed. This week Boris Johnson \u2013 who, when he was London mayor, shrank the capital\u2019s congestion zone \u2013 suggested that a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/latest-news/prime-minister-boris-johnson-says-this-should-be-a-new-golden-age-for-cycling-455473\">golden age of cycling</a>\u201d could be about to dawn. Having started slowly, British cities are putting in place pandemic measures such as <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-06/london-s-mayor-turns-to-cycling-to-solve-transit-s-virus-problem\">temporary cycle lanes</a> in London, and a <a href=\"https://www.stockport.gov.uk/news/council-helps-to-launch-safestreetssavelives-campaign-to-support-social\">Safe Streets Save Lives</a> scheme in Greater Manchester. The Committee on Climate Change, which advises the government, has told ministers that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/06/uks-coronavirus-recovery-should-have-green-focus-johnson-urged\">green policies </a>such as an accelerated transition to electric vehicles would be the strongest basis for an economic recovery.</p> <p>The UK\u2019s chronic overcentralisation remains a brake on progress. Properly accountable and resourced regional government is needed to engineer, both politically and practically, the modal shifts that are needed. But politics is not all top down, and the shift in behaviour during the lockdown, as millions of people have spent far more time on two wheels or feet, is also important. On a recent walk through my London neighbourhood I saw rollerbladers, sunbathers, neighbours playing darts against a gate and a game of badminton between parked cars. It\u2019s almost 40 years since Donald Appleyard showed in his book Livable Streets that less busy roads lead to stronger communities. Could the pandemic see the start of a broader movement to reclaim our town and cities from cars?</p> <p>\u2022 Susanna Rustin is a Guardian leader writer</p>",

Although there have been rumours of an outbreak before, it is the first time the outbreak has been so directly confirmed.<br></p> \n  <p>Ashoori said inmate Loghman Roozchang showed symptoms of the disease very soon after returning from furlough this week. He and two of his brothers convicted of embezzlement had been placed in Hall 2 of Wing 4 of the prison on their return as part of a supposed 14-day quarantine.</p> \n  <p>But he was taken away on Tuesday to hospital and his brother on Thursday confirmed that he had been tested positive.

The campaigners say prisoners are also moving between halls so making the quarantine a largely symbolic exercise designed to satisfy the World Health Organization, the UN body that advises national governments on how to defeat the infection.</p> \n  <p><strong>Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe</strong>, the best-known of the jailed British-Iranian dual nationals, had been kept in Evin for four years but was released on furlough in April and has spent the time on release at her parent\u2019s home on a tag in Tehran. She is waiting to hear if she will be granted clemency or instead returned to jail. Her husband Richard Ratcliffe has asked the UK ambassador to Tehran to visit her in an act of solidarity.</p> \n  <p>Tehran itself was hit by 5.1 earthquake on Thursday night, leading to civilians to rush into the streets for safety.

But if steps are not taken the world could see 31 million cases of gender-based violence, he warned. </p> \n  <p>He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>WHO is deeply troubled by the reports from many countries, including Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Ireland, Russian Federation, Spain, UK, and others of increases in interpersonal violence \u2013 including violence against women and men, by an intimate partner and against children - because of the COVID-19 response.</p> \n   <p>Although data is scarce, Member States are reporting up to a 60% increase in emergency calls by women subjected to violence by their intimate partners in April this year, compared to last. Online enquiries to violence prevention support hotlines have increased up to 5 times. </p> \n   <p>Our UN partner UNFPA has sounded the alarm loud and clear \u2013 if lockdowns were to continue for 6 months, we would expect an extra 31 million cases of gender-based violence globally. Beyond the figures, only a fraction of cases is ever reported. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He added that governments and local authorities should consider it to be a \u201cmoral obligation\u201d to make sure services are available, while calling on communities to look out for their friends, family and neighbours and speak out. </p> \n  <p>To victims, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Violence against you is <em>never</em> your fault. It is <em>never</em> your fault. Your home should be a secure place.
