Thanks as always for following along. </p> \n  <p>Here are the most important developments from the last few hours: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Wuhan lab had bat coronaviruses \u2013 but not Covid-19.</strong> The Chinese virology institute in Wuhan, the city in China at the heart of the coronavirus pandemic, has three live strains of bat coronavirus on-site, but none match the Covid-19 strain, its director has said. The director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology told state broadcaster CGTN that claims by US president Donald Trump that the virus could have leaked from the facility were \u201cpure fabrication\u201d. In an interview filmed on 13 May but broadcast on Saturday night, Wang Yanyi said the centre had \u201cisolated and obtained some coronaviruses from bats. Now we have three strains of live viruses \u2026 But their highest similarity to Sars-CoV-2 only reaches 79.8%.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>US opens up for summer. </strong>There are fears the US will suffer a second wave of coronavirus infections as it opens up for summer, just days away from the grim milestone of 100,000 Covid-19 deaths. Every state has relaxed restrictions to some extent, with many flocking to beaches and outdoor areas. The New York Times <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/24/new-york-times-front-page-1000-covid-19-death-notices\">filled the entire front page</a> of Sunday\u2019s paper with the death notices of victims from across the country as the country recorded more than 97,000 deaths.</li> \n   <li><strong>Argentina extends lockdown. </strong>Argentina has extended the mandatory lockdown in Buenos Aires until 7 June and tightened some movement restrictions, after a steady increase in the city\u2019s confirmed coronavirus cases in recent days. Officials will tighten traffic controls between the capital and Buenos Aires province, the area with the second highest concentration of cases. The country recorded 704 new infections on Saturday, one of the highest single-day increases since the pandemic began.</li> \n   <li><strong>Brazil cases near 350,000. </strong>Brazil registered 965 new coronavirus deaths on Saturday, taking the total number of fatalities to 22,013, the health ministry said. The country now has 347,398 confirmed cases, according to the ministry, up 16,508 from Friday, when it surpassed Russia to become the world\u2019s virus hot spot behind the US. The actual number of cases and deaths is believed to be higher than the official figures disclosed by the government, as the testing capacity of Latin America\u2019s largest country still lags.</li> \n   <li><strong>New Zealand reports no new cases. </strong>New Zealand\u2019s health ministry has announced there were zero new coronavirus cases confirmed in the last 24 hours. According to NewsHub, there are now only 27 active cases left in New Zealand, with one more patient recovered, bringing the country\u2019s total to 1,154, with 21 deaths.</li> \n   <li><strong>Australian states ease restrictions. </strong>In Australia, Victorian state premier, Daniel Andrews, has said Victorians will be allowed to have 20 people in their homes as well as overnight stays in hotels from 1 June. In New South Wales, Australia\u2019s most populous state, health minister Brad Hazzard announced that beauty, tanning, nail and waxing salons would all be open from 1 June.</li> \n   <li><strong>Pompeo threatens Australia over Belt and Road projects. </strong>The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has implied information sharing with Australia may be at risk if the Victoria proceeds with any Belt and Road projects that jeopardise communications networks. Issuing the highly qualified warning during an interview with Sky News Australia, the News Corp-owned channel, Pompeo urged Victoria to scrutinise any proposals \u201cincredibly closely\u201d because Belt and Road projects could \u201cbuild up the capacity of the Chinese Communist party to do harm\u201d. Victoria has attracted domestic political criticism for signing an agreement that would allow for it be part of the Belt and Road Initiative.</li> \n   <li><strong>French churches to hold first masses since lockdown started. </strong>French churches were preparing to hold their first Sunday masses in more than two months after the government bowed to a ruling that they should be reopened. Nearly two weeks into the relaxation of its shutdown, the government finally allowed churches, mosques and synagogues to reopen. Worshippers will have to wear masks, there will have to be disinfectant gel on hand and the seating will need to be organised to ensure people keep a safe distance from each other.</li> \n   <li><strong>Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser under pressure as second trip emerges. </strong>In the UK, prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, faces renewed pressure to resign after new witnesses reported <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/23/new-witnesses-cast-doubt-on-dominic-cummingss-lockdown-claims\">seeing him making a fresh trip</a> hundreds of miles to Durham.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/24/coronavirus-latest-24-may-at-a-glance\">Coronavirus latest: at a glance</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-24T07:11:22.294Z\">at 8.11am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eca19d58f0886ce4f5d951e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-24T06:56:05.370Z\">7.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In Australia, a Darwin pub has been fined more than AU$5,000 (US$3,270) for repeatedly failing to adhere to strict coronavirus laws.</p> \n  <p>Police and environmental health officers issued a caution to Lola\u2019s Pergola on 15 May for failing to serve separate meals to people consuming liquor, patrons not being seated while drinking and social distancing not being implemented.<br><br>One week later, further observations confirmed reports from concerned patrons that alcohol was being served without meals.</p> \n  <p>Advice about the chief health officer\u2019s directions was provided to the owner at the time.<br><br>But the next day, the venue had to be cautioned again and the following day the infringement notice was issued.<br><br>More than 11,000 compliance checks have been completed and 57 fines issued.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-24T06:58:26.951Z\">at 7.58am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eca10b58f08a1782fa807f8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/michael-savage\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-24T06:47:27.642Z\">7.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <h2>UK low-income households denied coronavirus support by benefit cap</h2> \n  <p>Tens of thousands of poor households are being denied extra support designed to ease the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, after being hit by the government\u2019s benefit cap.</p> \n  <p>The number of low-income households affected by the cap in London has doubled since the crisis started, according to analysis seen by the <em>Observer</em>. Households already at the cap when the crisis hit have been missing out on \u00a3320 a month in additional support. For private renters with children, this is \u00a3532 a month. A further 22,000 households are now at the cap and are missing out on an average of \u00a3185 a month.</p> \n  <p>It has led to an outcry that there is now a two-tier system, in which workers on the government\u2019s furlough scheme have access to far more support than some of those reliant on welfare.

As a result, no Southern or Thameslink trains will be running into Victoria over the bank holiday weekend, Network Rail said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the company said services between Manchester airport and Liverpool Lime Street to Preston will be affected due to renewal work of the rail track near Carlisle.</p> <p>Other routes affected by this weekend\u2019s national rail upgrade projects include Leeds to Wakefield, where there will no direct service on Sunday or Monday.</p> <p>Andrew Haines, the Network Rail chief executive, urged travellers to plan their bank holiday journeys ahead.</p> <p>\u201cWhile Britain tackles the coronavirus and social distancing is in place, the railway can carry a fraction of the usual number of passengers. So, to make sure there is space for critical workers, please avoid travelling by train unless absolutely necessary.</p> <p>\u201cThis bank holiday, to make sure our railway is at its very best when we emerge from this pandemic, we are continuing to work and invest in the rail network to make it more reliable for passengers. That means some journeys may be different, so if you have to travel please check your journey before leaving home,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The head of tourism on Brighton and Hove council has also urged those living beyond the seaside resort to avoid the city on bank holiday Monday.</p> <p>Councillor Carmen Appich said stewards would be used to direct people to less busy parts of the seafront if the area becomes too busy on Monday.</p> <p>The city council also pointed out that its seasonal lifeguard service will not be operating on Monday.</p> <p>Covid-19 social distancing restrictions interrupted the council\u2019s usual recruitment drive for lifeguards and as a result will start later in the summer. The lifeguards normally patrol Brighton and Hove\u2019s beaches from the end of May until the end of the school holidays in September.</p> <p>Brighton will be one of the hottest places across the UK on the bank holiday with temperatures expected to reach more than 20C on the south coast.</p> <p>Most of the country should enjoy a fine day with spells of warm sunshine according to the BBC Weather Centre. However, in north-west Scotland there will be south-westerly winds bringing in cloud and rain later in the day.</p> <p>The chances of a heavier volume of cross-border traffic bank holiday from Northern Ireland into the Irish Republic, meanwhile, may have increased after the partial easing of restrictions on pubs in the south.</p> <p>According to reports in Dublin, pubs in the Republic can now deliver drinks and sell takeaway alcohol at their premises.</p> <p>The partial easing of the clampdown on Irish bars came about after the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na took legal advice on what pubs can and cannot sell during the lockdown.</p> <p>As long as drinks including poured pints are paid for on licensed premises they can be delivered to customers. However, takeaways from the bars can only be permitted if they are consumed more than 100 metres away from the pub and not drunk in any public place.</p> <p>Some bars in border areas have been running takeaway services, such as O\u2019Flahery\u2019s pub in Buncrana, which is a short drive from Derry in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>Until last week, O\u2019Flaherty\u2019s was operating a \u201cGuinness Express\u201d with poured pints of stout being delivered wrapped in cling film. Gardai visited the bar last week but its owner claimed the police offices were unable to tell him which law he had broken by delivering pints.</p> <p>The new legal advice to the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na means O\u2019Flaherty\u2019s and all other southern Irish pubs can deliver drink including pulled pints if they are paid for in advance at the bar.</p>",
  "<p>A UK government claim that insurmountable legal obligations to China prevent ministers offering a right of abode to tens of thousands of Hong Kong citizens has been blown apart by new legal advice handed to Conservative MPs.</p> <p>The advice by one of the UK\u2019s most prominent immigration QCs is likely to shift the mood on the Tory benches in the face of a potential clampdown on Hong Kong by the Chinese government.</p> <p>The advice says ministers are wrong to suggest they are bound by agreements with China to refuse a right of abode to the tens of thousands of Hong Kong citizens who hold a British national (overseas), or BN(O), passport.</p> <p>Home Office ministers have been resisting a claim to a legal right of abode on the basis it might be in breach of the understandings the UK government reached with China alongside the 1984 joint declaration on the future of Hong Kong.</p> <p>The issue has suddenly regained importance after the Chinese government said it intended to impose sweeping new security laws on Hong Kong that risk its semi-autonomous status.</p> <p>The offer of a right of abode to BN(O) passport-holders is seen as one of the few practical steps that may be in the sole gift of the UK, the former colonial power of the city, to alleviate the plight of citizens fearing persecution by the Chinese state.</p> <p>A group of Tory MPs, led by Bob Seely and Imran Ahmad Khan, have seen the new legal advice and want at least a clear government statement that no legal obstacle exists to an offer of a right of abode, and any refusal to make that offer is purely a political or diplomatic choice.</p> <p>BN(O) passport-holders have the right to visit for up to six months, but cannot automatically work in the UK or gain citizenship. Seely said: \u201cIt would be a stain on our country\u2019s reputation if other nations were to open their arms, metaphorically speaking, to Hong Kong BN(O) folk in their hour of need before the UK did so.\u201d</p> <p>Ministers have frequently said, most recently last year, that an offer of right of abode would be in breach of the commitments made by the British and Chinese governments in memorandums attached to the 1984 Sino-British joint declaration on the future of Hong Kong. Those memorandums established BN(O) in Hong Kong as a new class of British citizens that could only be claimed by those born before the handover.</p> <p>But in a new opinion, Laurie Fransman, the leading QC on nationality law, writes: \u201cDomestic British nationality law has evolved since the 1984 declaration including by giving greater extension of the right of abode to \u2018British nationals\u2019, including BN(O)s, in compliance with the expectations of international law.\u201d</p> <p>British citizens, including some BN(O)s, were given a right to register, he points out, adding: \u201cManifestly, the UK government did not consider itself barred by the memoranda, or anything else, from taking such action.\u201d He says he endorses those who claim BN(O)s can be given a right of abode.</p> <p>In making their legal case, ministers also frequently cite a report on citizenship written for the then Labour government by the former attorney general Lord Goldsmith in 2008.</p> <p>Goldsmith has himself written to the home secretary, Priti Patel, to ask the government to stop using him in aid of their argument. In his letter he insists he had not in 2008 himself passed any judgment on whether a right of abode from BN(O)s would be in breach of the joint declaration, adding his position had been mischaracterised by the government.</p> <p>He wrote that his report had merely cited, but not endorsed, the contemporary view of the Foreign Office that it may be in breach. His own subsequent independent examination of this issue, he said in his letter sent in February, found that the joint declaration was no obstacle.</p> <p>Goldsmith pointed out, in a view endorsed by Fransman, that the status of the BN(O)s is not mentioned in the joint declaration but in a memorandum of understanding sent by the British government on the same day. The memorandum was received by the Chinese government, but never signed or agreed.</p> <p>The memorandum excludes a right of abode, Goldsmith concedes, but he claims it did not bind the future domestic actions of the UK government in perpetuity.</p> <p>Armed with the new legal arguments, Seely and Ahmad Khan have now written to Patel, saying : \u201cGiven the deteriorating situation in Hong Kong, with the continued erosion of the rule of law, it strikes us that the government could consider reviewing its position on BN(O) passports.</p> <p>\u201cBN(O) passports were always a compromise, dependent in part on the rights guaranteed in the handover settlement. The introduction of the national security legislation means that that settlement is essentially dead. As such there are clear legal and practical grounds for looking again at this matter.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The lockdown was a nationwide policy: everyone was expected to follow the same rules. It has nevertheless exposed some stark inequalities. Elites have been able to endure the period in comfort, often in remote, spacious holiday homes. Those with office jobs have found themselves stuck in their flats, juggling restless children and Zoom meetings. And at the lower end of the income scale, there are people still showing up for their essential jobs as cleaners, delivery drivers and nurses, with scant childcare support and constant worry about exposure to the virus.</p> <p>These are tense times, with millions of us making sacrifices, some large, some small. Whether\u2019s it\u2019s cobbling together a home-schooling programme while ill yourself, being deprived of the support of extended family or missing a loved one\u2019s funeral, the toll has been significant. It\u2019s no surprise then, that news the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser travelled from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/22/dominic-cummings-coronavirus-and-lockdown-a-timeline\">London to Durham</a> with his family while lockdown measures were in place has set off a wave of fury. While the British people have been remarkably forgiving of special privileges for senior members of the government \u2013 such as access to priority testing and tracing for themselves and their families, and early medical support upon diagnosis \u2013 extending this to an exemption from lockdown rules feels like a step too far.</p> <p>From a public health perspective, though, the situation with Cummings presents three problems. First, and most obviously, it undermines the core message to stay at home. This is vitally important because the purpose of lockdown is to buy time to drive down the number of cases to a level that would allow a package of interventions \u2013 including testing and tracing, and isolation \u2013 to take over the job of suppressing the outbreak. If lockdown is interpreted flexibly, or lifted too early, or seen as a symbolic gesture alone, it becomes pointless.</p> <p>Second, Cummings\u2019s actions give an unfortunate impression as far as exposing elderly people to the virus goes. According to Downing Street\u2019s statement on the affair, he remained with his wife and children in a house <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/23/dominic-cummings-no-10-accused-of-covering-up-lockdown-breach\">near, but separate to, his family</a>, including his mother and father. But to travel across the country to where his parents live inevitably erodes the strong message that precautions to protect older relatives are especially important, given that mortality increases with age.</p> <p>Third, Cummings travelled from London, an area that had a higher number of daily cases, and was ahead on the epidemic trajectory, to the north-east of England, which was less badly affected at the time, but which would soon become one of the hardest hits parts of the country. The lockdown measures were intended to prevent the spread of the virus from hotspots to less-exposed regions.</p> <p>Others advising on the pandemic response have had to resign for far less. This is not a left-right issue. Instead it is about right and wrong, and the government choosing to defend the actions of one of its leading figures over the public health message it has been pushing for the past eight weeks, and which is designed to save lives.</p> <p>Any undermining of that message could not come at a worse time: the UK is facing excess deaths of nearly 60,000, and has one of the highest death rates per capita in the world. There is no functioning test, trace and isolate system in place to take over the job of breaking chains of transmission and support the easing of lockdown. As other countries drive the virus to the margins and celebrate the reopening of shops, hairdressers, schools and businesses, the latest Office for National Statistics survey estimates <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19roundup/2020-03-26\">9,000 daily new cases</a> in the UK. People are suffering from an incoherent public health response, a late and consequently unnecessarily long lockdown, and leaders losing sight of those they\u2019re supposed to serve.</p> <p>While it might be psychologically appealing to believe the worst of the outbreak is behind us, early estimates from antibody tests, which provide a rough guide on what percentage of the population has been exposed, show most countries at under 10%, with cities slightly higher. The <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2020/05/21/17-londoners-5-rest-uk-have-coronavirus-antibodies-12739901/\">UK\u2019s estimate is 5%</a>, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/14/france-spain-say-large-scale-testing-coronavirus-shows-no-herd/\">Spain 5</a>% and Sweden 7%. This is nowhere near the level of exposure needed for population-wide natural \u201cherd\u201d immunity. Last week saw the largest number of daily new cases in the world, at 106,000, with outbreaks starting to take off in many low- and middle-income countries.</p> <p>The summer months must be used to think ahead, since the winter poses additional challenges. How can a second lockdown be avoided? How can more deaths be prevented? The clear lessons from east Asia are a robust test, trace and isolate system, close monitoring of hotspots such as care homes and hospitals, the protection of health and social care workers, border control and working towards a \u201cnew normal\u201d involving face masks, temperature checks and distancing.</p> <p>Every single person in the world is now affected by this outbreak. How exactly they are affected has more to do with their government\u2019s handling of the virus than anything else. Successful responses have not been correlated with country wealth, but rather with decisive political will and a clear strategy. Just compare the situations in the United States and Brazil with South Korea, Kerala in India, Greece, Vietnam and Senegal. Everything \u2013 whether it is schools reopening, the shielding of the elderly and vulnerable individuals, the viability of businesses, and families being able to see each other \u2013 depends on the ability of a government to contain this virus aggressively and quickly. Those of us who live in the UK need this government to succeed, but that requires it to focus all its efforts on public health planning, clear communication and retaining public trust \u2013 something made harder when a senior adviser appears to flout the rules.</p> <p>\u2022 Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh</p>",

Get in touch on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan\">Twitter @helenrsullivan</a> with tweets, takes, questions and comments.</p> <p>After a twisty little week, last Sunday\u2019s elimination saw everyone but Poh compete in an elimination challenge, over two rounds. The first, a one-on-one fight to the death, where contestants were randomly paired against each other to battle it out over a nation\u2019s cuisine. The second was \u201cclassic flavour pairings\u201d, and Laura made pasta <em>and</em> sang a song about the ingredients: \u201cDooo do do do tomato and basil.\u201d The judges liked the dish.</p> <p>Tessa was declared safe. Sarah C and Hayden were flummoxed by beetroot and horseradish. Hayden went home. </p> <p><strong>This week: </strong></p> <p>Monday. The contestants split into yellow and pink teams, with besties Brendan and Reece again competing with one another, this time as team captains. There was a bit of banter: </p> <p>Reece (pink): \u201cAre you ready to lose again?\u201d<br>Brendan (yellow): \u201cYou will be eating your words shortly\u201d. Bless their hearts.</p> <p><strong>Tuesday: Black Box Challenge</strong></p> <p>Ides chef Peter Gunn had the contestants replicate his \u201cBlack Box\u201d, a small cube filled with wonder. The finicky box evoked sensations of \u201cStar Wars\u201d and \u201cDarth Vader\u201d but was also described as \u201ccute\u201d. </p> <p>To me the BBC had the exact tone of this remix of<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skK3WoK5Z8A\"> the other BBC\u2019s (the news one) theme song remixed to Dua Lipa</a>. The \u201cbox of the day\u201d belonged to Laura.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday: Vegan mystery box challenge. </strong></p> <p>Reece smashed it. Poh smashed it. Simon smashed it. Jess smaaa-aaashed it. All of them got immunity. </p> <p><strong>Thursday: Ramen challenge</strong></p> <p>These dishes looked looked tasty as hell. Jess and Poh won the instant noodle challenge and advanced to the next round. Jess won. Reece and Simon headed for elimination. </p> <p><strong>It was a good week for... </strong></p> <p>Instant ramen</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mrbenjaminlaw/status/1263374568686669824\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Holy shit, tonight&#39;s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MasterchefAU?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MasterchefAU</a> focuses entirely on instant ramen \u2013 a real Sophie&#39;s Choice moment for every East Asian person, shout out to my fellow yellows tonight. <a href=\"https://t.co/G1ziI0EL38\">pic.twitter.com/G1ziI0EL38</a></p>&mdash; Benjamin Law \u7f85\u65ed\u80fd (@mrbenjaminlaw) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mrbenjaminlaw/status/1263374568686669824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 21, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Jess:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FierceRobert/status/1263425665644130305\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Talented \u2705<br>Beyond her years \u2705 <br>Helps out her competitors \u2705<br>Gorgeous inside and out \u2705<br><br>How can you not love Jess <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MasterChefAU?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MasterChefAU</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/xy0DFGEqCz\">pic.twitter.com/xy0DFGEqCz</a></p>&mdash; robert.

  "<p>Dundee were thinking big at the start of the 1992-93 season, their first in the Premier Division for two years. The manager, Simon Stainrod, had revamped the squad, with the former Everton captain Kevin Ratcliffe and the former Arsenal midfielder Graham Rix among that summer\u2019s arrivals. The club\u2019s new home strip was modelled on Sampdoria, who had been European Cup finalists that year. And the club\u2019s owner, the Canadian businessman Ron Dixon, had plans to build a new stand at Dens Park with an ice rink underneath.</p> <p>But three matches into the season, and despite being handed a gentle start with games against Falkirk, Airdrie and St Johnstone, Dundee were still looking for their first win. And the best team in the country were up next.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/jan/18/the-forgotten-story-of-when-diego-maradona-signed-for-dundee\">The Forgotten Story of \u2026 when Diego Maradona 'signed' for Dundee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rangers were four league titles into their sequence of nine successive championships. They had big-money signings and internationals almost everywhere you looked; Mark Hateley and Ally McCoist up front; Stuart McCall and Alexei Mikhailichenko in midfield; Richard Gough and Dave McPherson in defence. We felt sure the wait for a win would go on for another week, the \u201cwe\u201d being my older brother and his friends who I met in a pub near the city\u2019s then only university before kick-off (soft drinks only for me).</p> <p>Dundee started well, encouraged from the sidelines by Stainrod, who caught everyone\u2019s attention by wearing a full-length raincoat and fedora, looking like Dick Tracy come to lay down the law. Ivo den Bieman, a Dutch winger who had originally come to Scotland to study, headed home Rix\u2019s corner at the near post to open the scoring. McCoist equalised from a free-kick soon after but Ian Gilzean restored Dundee\u2019s lead when Rangers couldn\u2019t clear another Rix corner. Gilzean\u2019s goal came a month shy of the 30th anniversary of his father, Alan, scoring a hat-trick for Dundee in an 8-1 win over K\u00f6ln in the European Cup.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJqmZmUDC4s\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XJqmZmUDC4s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Minutes before half-time, McCoist equalised again, this time from close range, but then midway through the second half, Dundee went ahead for the third time. Gilzean flicked on Alan Dinnie\u2019s cross and Billy Dodds beat Ally Maxwell in the Rangers goal with a first-time volley. It was a great finish but it would be another four years, long after he had left the club, before Dodds won the first of his 26 Scotland caps.</p> <p>Dodds and Gilzean had sights of goal to give Dundee a two-goal cushion and it looked like those missed chances would be costly when, with 10 minutes to go, the Rangers substitute Ian Ferguson thumped home Hateley\u2019s knockdown to make it 3-3. But instead of playing as if they just had the stuffing knocked out of them, Dundee continued on the front foot. And with six minutes to go, Gough fouled Gilzean and the referee awarded a penalty. Dodds sent Maxwell the wrong way and Dundee were back in front. We expected an onslaught in the time left but bar a McCoist shot that flew wide Dundee comfortably saw the game out. They had deservedly beaten the champions. Now our season was up and running.</p> <p>\u201cWe went for their jugular and ripped it out,\u201d said Stainrod of his side\u2019s performance. Rangers, though, quickly recovered.

  "<p>A British man has been detained in an Indian prison after being accused of breaching the country\u2019s strict coronavirus lockdown rules.</p> <p>Sohail Hughes, 29, had been on an extended holiday to visit family in the Gujarat region before undertaking a pilgrimage of mosques when he was detained last month.</p> <p>His family, who have a <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/home-office-bring-sohail-hughes-home?recruiter=1092128940&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=tap_basic_share\">launched a petition</a> to have him freed, have claimed he is being unlawfully held by Indian officials.</p> <p>Hughes\u2019 sister, Aatika, said he was forced to take refuge in a mosque in Bhopal after being caught out by the swiftly implemented lockdown laws requiring people to stay off the streets.</p> <p>Aatika, 35, says her brother, alongside dozens of other men, had his passport seized before being kept in quarantine for more than a month inside a hostel. While in quarantine Hughes has been repeatedly tested for Covid-19 and has always been negative.</p> <p>Aatika said: \u201cThe Indian government gave the public four hours to get to where they needed to go, before all public transport was seized. Where were these foreigners supposed to go?</p> <p>\u201cHowever, at the same time many other people were in similar situations, stranded in yoga centres, temples and other such places with nowhere else to go but to have to wait to be repatriated. These people were free to go back to their homes, back to their countries, back to their families and loved ones, no questions asked.\u201d</p> <p>On Thursday, Hughes appeared in court in Bhopal, accused of spreading coronavirus and violating visa regulations after being caught in the mosque with other people. His bail application was rejected and he is now being kept in the Old Central Jail in Madhya Pradesh city.</p> <p>There is uncertainty over his next court date, with Hughes\u2019s family saying he has become a victim of the recent escalation in anti-Muslim sentiment in the country.</p> <p>\u201cWe have been left devastated by his treatment. At least when he was in the hostel, in quarantine, we could speak with him but since he has been in jail there has been no contact and we have no idea when he will be able to speak to us again or anything about his next court date. We are so worried about him,\u201d said Aatika.</p> <p>Hughes, a joiner, who lives in Dewsbury with his wife and three-year-old child, flew to India in February and was due to return to the UK on 13 May. The British embassy was informed of his detention on 25 April, after he had been in quarantine for about 35 days.</p> <p>In a Foreign Office (FCO) email to the family seen by the Guardian, a civil servant says she appreciates this must be a concerning time for the family but that neither the FCO nor the British high commission could interfere with legal processes in another country.</p> <p>The email states: \u201cWe cannot get British nationals out of prison or detention, nor can we get special treatment for anyone because they are British. I would strongly advise that you consult with a local lawyer who will be able to advise on your options.\u201d</p> <p>In an official statement, the FCO confirmed that a consular team had been in direct with Hughes while he was in quarantine and have also been in close contact with his family to give them the latest updates.</p> <p>An FCO spokesperson said: \u201cWe are supporting a British man who has been detained in India and are in contact with the prison officials and local authorities.\u201d</p> <p>India has been in lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus since 24 March. When the prime minister, Narendra Modi, announced the measure, he did so with barely four hours\u2019 notice. This led to hundreds of thousands of people trying to flee cities to go back to their villages and foreigners desperately trying to book flights out of the country.</p> <p>In mid-April, the UK government organised charter flights for the thousands of British people stranded in the country, with planes departing to London from Ahmedabad, Amritsar, Bangalore, Delhi, Goa and Mumbai.</p> <p>A statement said people who were most vulnerable would be prioritised for seats on the flights. It said the number of people already registered for a flight meant the majority of the roughly 4,000 seats available were likely to be allocated to people already on waiting lists.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Passport details<br></strong>Matthew Alexander Henson, perhaps the first person to the North Pole. Born Charles County, Maryland, US, 8 August 1866.</p> <p><strong>Claim to fame<br></strong>Matthew Henson, the descendant of slaves, has a plausible claim to being the first explorer to reach the North Pole. He grew up in Washington DC and Baltimore, was orphaned and left school at 12 to be a cabin boy. When he was 22, a chance encounter with naval engineer Robert Peary resulted in a lifelong working relationship, including 18 years of Arctic exploration. On 6 April 1909, Henson, Peary and four Inuit drove their dogsleds to the North Pole \u2013 or as near as makes no difference. Peary took the credit for being first, but a newspaper article on their return quoted Henson as saying he\u2019d been part of a leading group that had overshot the pole by several miles: \u201cWe went back then and I could see my footprints were the first at the spot.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Supporting documentation<br></strong>Henson\u2019s engaging 1912 memoir, <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20923\">A Negro Explorer at the North Pole</a>, reads like a Boy\u2019s Own Adventure. Henson\u2019s dog-handling skills, fluent Inuit and all-round resourcefulness were key to the expedition\u2019s success. \u201cI have a steady job carpentering, also interpreting, barbering, tailoring, dog-training,\u201d he writes. The warmth of his response to the Inuit is striking: \u201cI have come to love these people \u2026 They are my friends and regard me as theirs.\u201d The memoir\u2019s final page includes the names of 218 Inuit from Smith Sound, on Canada\u2019s Ellesmere Island. Among them are Akatingwah, Henson\u2019s Inuit lover, and Ahnaukaq, their son.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6abf01aea2b483aff0a947d001bbb8535f788f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6abf01aea2b483aff0a947d001bbb8535f788f6/0_0_3573_3914/913.jpg\" alt=\"Matthew Henson in his Arctic gear in 1909.\" width=\"913\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matthew Henson in his Arctic gear in 1909.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Distinguishing marks<br></strong>Henson lived a long life. Photographs show him on board ship and as a genial old codger, but the most arresting image was taken after that dash to the pole: he peers out of his fur parka, quietly challenging assumptions of what an Arctic explorer might look like to some.</p> <p><strong>Last sighted<br></strong>Henson lived the rest of his life in relative obscurity, working as a clerk for US Customs, and died in 1955. He married twice, and had no children apart from Ahnaukaq Henson, who, in 1987, at the age of 80, achieved his lifetime ambition of visiting the land of his father\u2019s birth.</p> <p><strong>Intrepidness rating<br></strong>Obstacles he faced included ice floes, snowstorms, frostbite and racism: 9.</p>",
  "<p>So now we know why the government is struggling to set up a reliable \u201ctrack and trace\u201d system. The technology does not yet exist to track and trace the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser to ensure that he is complying with the lockdown rules that the rest of the country has been drilled to obey.</p> <p>Since his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/22/dominic-cummings-durham-trip-coronavirus-lockdown\">rule-breaking was revealed</a>, there has been a wave of demands for the resignation of Dominic Cummings and it is likely to grow stronger after today\u2019s additional allegations. This much is common ground and undenied by Downing Street. He left his family home when his wife had coronavirus symptoms and he feared he had contracted the disease, which it turned out he had. They travelled a long way: London to Durham is not a trip to the local shops for essential items. His Durham-based parents, both in their seventies, are in a high-vulnerability age group. That was a breach of the rules on lockdown which the entire nation was expected to obey on penalty of being found in transgression of the law. The government instructions which he had a hand in drawing up were not vague, but crystal in their clarity. If any member of a household has symptoms, \u201cdo not leave your home for any reason\u201d.</p> <p>Number 10 has been trying to bat off the demands for his resignation by depicting this as a human story, deserving of our compassion, in which worried parents needed help with childcare. They took a suspiciously long time to weave together this defence. The official statement was only issued after 10am on Saturday. That was more than 12 hours after the story broke, which is a very long time to produce a response to such a major development in the age of 24/7 media. The statement says that he and his wife made the long road trip because, \u201cowing to his wife being infected with suspected coronavirus and the high likelihood that he would himself become unwell, it was essential for Dominic Cummings to ensure his young child could be properly cared for\u201d. </p> <p>I\u2019m not convinced that this defence will attract the public sympathy they hope for. Other Britons have faced similar agonies during a lockdown that has presented tough, sometimes heartbreaking dilemmas for many, many people. The rules are nevertheless clear. Anyone with reason to believe they have Covid-19 has to quarantine in their main family home for 14 days. The rules are clear for a reason. They don\u2019t work if people feel free to choose to make themselves exceptions, however much they may think they deserve to be. No infected household, however mighty or modest their status, was supposed to be making 264-mile trips to live somewhere else. The government\u2019s slogan was \u201cStay At Home, Save Lives, Protect The NHS.\u201d It was not \u201cStay At Home (Unless You Are Dom), Save Lives (Not Compulsory For The Prime Minister\u2019s Top Aide), Protect The NHS (At Your Own Discretion If You Work In Downing Street).\u201d</p> <p>The chief medical officer of Scotland was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/05/scotland-chief-medical-officer-seen-flouting-lockdown-advice-catherine-calderwood\">impelled to resign </a>for a lesser breach. Neil Ferguson, the Imperial College professor, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-adviser-prof-neil-ferguson-resigns-after-breaking-lockdown-rules\">forced to quit </a>the Sage advisory group when it was revealed that he had flouted the rules by having his lover visit him at home. \u201cThe right decision,\u201d said the health secretary, Matt Hancock. Public confidence in the government\u2019s handling of the epidemic is badly corroded when key figures behave as if the rules apply to everyone but themselves. When trust, so absolutely essential to the handling of this crisis, is abused and diminished, the public loses faith in the calibre and integrity of decision-makers.</p> <p>Were we talking about anyone other than Mr Cummings \u2013 were we talking about a less powerful figure than the tea cosy-wearing Rasputin of Number 10 \u2013 he would be gone already. He survives only at the indulgence of his employer.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Were we talking about anyone other than MrCummings, he would be gone already</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So what started as a significant revelation about the chief adviser is already evolving into an even more important story about Boris Johnson and his premiership.</p> <p>There was some surprise among Tories when Mr Cummings, a figure previously most closely associated with Michael Gove, was given such a sweeping role at Number 10. The explanation was that Mr Johnson had been impressed with the demotic energy and mendacious but effective messaging that he had brought to the Leave side of the Brexit referendum. He went up further in the prime minister\u2019s estimation by crafting the ultimately successful brinkmanship strategy that Number 10 employed during the bitter battles over Brexit during the last parliament. </p> <p>Since the Tories\u2019 majority-winning election result last December, Mr Cummings has amassed a vast amount of clout. Though he has not won every battle that he has started, he has made himself one of the most powerful unelected figures ever to work at Number 10. He instigated the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/13/sajid-javid-resigns-as-chancellor-amid-boris-johnson-reshuffle\">resignation of a chancellor </a>earlier in the year when Sajid Javid found his demands too humiliating to bear. One former cabinet minister recently complained to me: \u201cCummings has complete contempt for parliament and for the cabinet whom he regards as shit.\u201d He is the architect of a \u201chub and spokes\u201d design for government which is circulating within Whitehall and intended to make all ministers subordinate supplicants to an all-controlling centre run by him from Number 10 and by Mr Gove from the Cabinet Office.</p> <p>There was a hot controversy when it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/revealed-dominic-cummings-on-secret-scientific-advisory-group-for-covid-19\">revealed </a>that the chief adviser had been attending meetings of Sage, the body under the chairmanship of Sir Patrick Vallance, which is tasked with delivering dispassionate scientific counsel to the government. Some scientists on the committee actually welcomed his presence, on the basis that this was the only way to get their advice transformed into policy. They reported that only Mr Cummings could be guaranteed to seize the undivided attention of an easily distracted prime minister who is not renowned for his devotion to detail. That is a measure of his power. That is also an illustration of how dependent Mr Johnson has become on him.</p> <p>The prime minister\u2019s first reflex will be to try to brazen this out. He will be cross about the furious cyclone that is now raging around Mr Cummings, but he won\u2019t be personally mortified that his chief adviser didn\u2019t follow the government\u2019s instructions. The prime minister\u2019s own biography is littered with examples of a cavalier attitude towards norms of behaviour. Rules are for other people \u2013 not for Boris Johnson. That has been one of the guiding principles of a life not otherwise distinguished by many principles. His own biography is also rich with examples of blunders and scandals that he has survived simply by refusing to be shamed by them. So his first desire will be for the storm to blow itself out after 48 hours or so.</p> <p>But if it doesn\u2019t? This prime minister is also a ruthless calculator of where his personal advantage lies. He will be weighing how much damage this furore could do to him if it doesn\u2019t quickly subside. This story broke at the end of what was already the government\u2019s worst fortnight of the crisis. Number 10 has been forced to perform a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/johnson-forced-to-drop-nhs-surcharge-for-migrant-health-workers\">U-turn</a> on imposing \u201cNHS surcharges\u201d on foreign-born health workers, a reverse more hateful to the prime minister because he was forced into it after the leader of the opposition pursued him on the issue. Plans for a partial reopening of schools have collided with resistance from teachers and parents. </p> <p>The grim death toll in care homes and fresh concerns about the government\u2019s ability to deliver on tracking and tracing have contributed to a febrile mood among Tory MPs. Many of them will celebrate if Mr Cummings is defenestrated from Number 10. They resent his swaggering power, they hate the ill-disguised disdain with which he treats them, and they would be delighted to see him gone. As we enter the delicate and perilous process of easing out of the lockdown without reigniting the epidemic, public confidence in the government\u2019s handling of the emergency has turned negative for the first time since the crisis began. Confidence is not likely to be restored by the revelation that the prime minister\u2019s closest adviser has been breaking the rules.</p> <p>Another thing the life of Boris Johnson tells us is that his only core commitment is to himself. Journalistic colleagues, fellow politicians and wives have all found that there is no such thing as the undying loyalty of this prime minister. However important you may be to him for a time, you will become dispensable when he decides you have outlived your usefulness.</p> <p>Dominic Cummings will have the full support of Boris Johnson. Until he suddenly doesn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u2022Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</p>",
  "<p><br>When American astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley arrive at the International Space Station this week, they will find an unusual message waiting for them. On the inside of the hatch where their SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft is scheduled to dock, a small stars and stripes flag has been sealed in a plastic bag with a cryptic message attached. \u201cFlown on STS-1 and STS-135. Only to be removed by a crew launched from KSC.\u201d</p> <p>It sounds enigmatic but the meaning is straightforward. The flag, which measures 8 inches by 12 inches, was flown on board the first space shuttle mission (<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/archives/sts-1.html\">STS-1</a>) in 1981. And it was carried aloft in 2011 when the shuttle Atlantis rendezvoused with the space station on the last shuttle mission (<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts135/launch/sts-135_mission-overview.html\">STS-135</a>). KSC simply stands for the Kennedy Space Centre.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"20eef8dde7e6a62e58b2e1a41f91d796504ac027\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20eef8dde7e6a62e58b2e1a41f91d796504ac027/0_0_2733_2187/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley, stand beside the SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Astronauts Bob Behnken, left, and Doug Hurley, stand beside the SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft, which is due to launch on Wednesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NASA/ZUMA Wire</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Departing astronauts on Atlantis had left the flag and message before flying their craft back to the US, where it was grounded with the other remaining shuttle craft in the wake of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/feb/04/challenger-space-shuttle-video-discovered\">Challenger</a> and <a href=\"https://www.space.com/19436-columbia-disaster.html\">Columbia</a> tragedies. Only when Americans returned \u2013 in a new fleet of their own spaceships \u2013 was that flag to be brought back to Earth, it was decreed.</p> <p>Now that moment is about to arrive.

Crewed spaceflights into low Earth orbit will now be taken over by private businesses which have already been ferrying supplies to the space station. To date, only the governments of America, Russia and China have been able to mount crewed space programmes.

Nasa had developed a strong risk aversion policy, which meant its vehicles were more complex than necessary, and a lack of competition provided no incentive to keep costs down.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902uVsudRNgu76U/\" data-alt=\"Guardian graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902uVsudRNgu76U/\">Guardian graphic</a> </figure>  <p>Now that is changing. Apart from the involvement of Musk\u2019s SpaceX company, the aerospace giant Boeing has also built its own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/dec/22/nasa-boeing-starliner-capsule-lands-safely-new-mexico\">spaceship, Starliner</a>, and later this year it also plans to ferry astronauts to the space station. On the sidelines, companies such as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/science/jeff-bezos-moon.html\">Blue Origin</a>, founded by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/05/20/business/ap-us-virgin-orbit.html?searchResultPosition=9\">Virgin Orbit</a>, founded by Richard Branson, and several other companies are also working on their own commercial space plans.</p> <p>\u201cThat should slowly have an effect,\u201d said De Winne. \u201cSpace travel should become cheaper as these different companies compete, and that will mean we can spend more on our satellites and probes and less on launching costs.\u201d</p> <p>It has not been an easy task, however. SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 launcher \u2013 which will ferry Crew Dragon into space \u2013 broke apart once in flight and once during a ground test. Boeing suffered numerous software failures during test missions of its Starliner, and only flew in space, uncrewed, last December. Commercial launches were planned for 2017 but are only now set to take place.</p> <p>Falcon 9 and Crew Dragon are now standing at Kennedy\u2019s launch pad 39A and should lift off for the space station on Wednesday. Should the mission be scrapped at the last minute, however, Boeing\u2019s Starliner spaceship will then have the chance to become the first crewed commercial spaceship.</p> <p>And thereby hangs a tale. Starliner will be commanded by Charles Ferguson, who was commander of Atlantis on its last mission, and who was involved in leaving the flag and message on the space station hatch.</p> <p>Intriguingly, on that mission he was accompanied by Doug Hurley, who is now the commander of Crew Dragon. Both men have remained in the US crewed space programme and are rivals to bring back the flag, with Hurley in pole position. Ferguson remains unflustered. \u201cRegardless of who might get there first, it\u2019s a win for America,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 25 May 2020 to refer to \u201ccrewed\u201d (rather than \u201cmanned\u201d) space missions.</p>",
  "<p>\u2018To speak about the meaning and value of life may seem more necessary today than ever.\u201d It\u2019s a quote that might have been plucked from any number of op-eds over the past couple of months. It\u2019s in fact the opening sentence of a 1946 lecture by psychotherapist and Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl.</p> <p>The previous year, Frankl had still been incarcerated in Auschwitz. Now he was giving a series of talks in Vienna about what his experience of Nazi death camps had taught him about the human condition. Those lectures have just been published in English for the first time as <em><a href=\"https://www.penguin.com.au/books/yes-to-life-in-spite-of-everything-9781846046360\">Yes to Life in Spite of Everything</a></em>. Frankl\u2019s is a voice that seems as necessary now as it was in the shadow of the Holocaust.</p> <p>Shortly after the lectures, Frankl published the book for which he has become celebrated \u2013 <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/09/viktor-frankls-book-on-the-psychology-of-the-holocaust-to-be-made-into-a-film\">Man\u2019s Search for Meaning</a></em>. In it, he argues that in order to survive the concentration camps one had to be able \u2013 even in the most degrading of circumstances \u2013 to find meaning in life. \u201cEverything can be taken from a man but one thing,\u201d Frankl wrote, \u201cthe last of the human freedoms \u2013 to choose one\u2019s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one\u2019s own way.\u201d</p> <p>Frankl\u2019s stress on the importance of one\u2019s attitude, whatever the circumstances, has turned him into a guru of positivity and self-help. At the heart of his philosophy, however, was not mindless optimism but responsibility. \u201cMan should not ask what the meaning of his life is,\u201d Frankl wrote, \u201cbut rather must recognise that it is he who is asked.\u201d</p> <p>Frankl was born into a Jewish family in Vienna in 1905. It was a city of intellectual and political ferment, graced by such towering figures as Freud and Wittgenstein, Popper and Schoenberg, Carnap and Klimt.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is humans, and humans alone, who imbue the world with meaning</p> <footer> <cite>Viktor Frankl</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The city was also deeply polarised, a seedbed for fascism and communism. In 1934, the far right seized control of Austria, shutting down parliament and banning the social democrats, of whom Frankl was one. Four years later came <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1938/mar/14/leadersandreply.mainsection\">Anschluss</a>,</em> the German annexation of Austria. In 1942, Frankl\u2019s entire family was transported to concentration camps. His parents, wife and brother all perished in the Holocaust.</p> <p>Frankl\u2019s philosophy was shaped by what came to be called \u201cexistentialism\u201d. For existentialists, humans do not possess an unchanging essence from which our capacities, personalities and values derive. Rather, humans create themselves, and their nature, by acting upon the world. Humans, the French existential philosopher <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/22/jean-paul-sartre-refuses-nobel-prize-literature-50-years-books\">Jean-Paul Sartre </a>wrote, are \u201ccondemned to be free\u201d; condemned because we have no choice but to make choices.</p> <p>Frankl\u2019s experience of the death camps reinforced his existentialist views. It was here, he insisted, when almost everything worthwhile had been torn from people, and everything done to dehumanise them, that it was most important to find value and meaning in life. Those who survived were the ones best able to do so.</p> <p>The significance of Frankl\u2019s work lies not in his positivity or optimism but in his insistence that it is humans, and humans alone, who imbue the world with meaning. There is no external authority to whom we can turn to help us decide notions of right and wrong, good and bad. We can rely only on ourselves.</p> <p>Yet, if existentialism\u2019s strength lies in its insistence on the importance of freedom and responsibility \u2013 and on the necessity of making choices \u2013 its weakness stems from its difficulties in relating individual agency to our existence as social beings. We all live as part of communities and societies. It is through the social bonds we make with others that our individuality emerges.</p> <p>Meaning, too, is social as much as it is individual; the very ideas of \u201cfreedom\u201d, \u201cresponsibility\u201d or \u201cthe individual\u201d make sense only in specific social contexts. Existential arguments often seem as if individual choice and responsibility have been unstitched from the rest of the architecture of our lives. It leaves them open to be purloined by both libertarian ideas of the market and psychologies that obsesses with the self.</p> <p>Difficulties in understanding the relationship between the individual and the social is an issue not just for existentialists. It is one of the key problems facing western societies today. Whether immigration or free speech, the pressing questions of recent years have been fundamentally about how individual rights and social needs can be reconciled. So, too, have many of the controversies over coronavirus policy, from the debate over lockdown to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/15/when-will-schools-reopen-uk-children-safe-coronavirus\">question of when schools should reopen</a>. It\u2019s a good time to engage with both the strengths and weaknesses of Frankl\u2019s existentialism and to rescue it from those who can see the individual but not the social.</p> <p>\u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist</p>",

For years, Kennedy has travelled across Mexico \u2013 from Chihuahua, in the north, to Yucat\u00e1n, near the borders of Guatemala and Belize \u2013 in order to document its food culture, always with a sense of where she planned to go, but never entirely sure where she might end up. (\u201cThe important discoveries in my life have always happened by chance,\u201d she has said.) When she arrived in a new town, she would visit its food market, and she\u2019d ask the people she met there where they came from and what they liked to cook and how and which ingredients they used. Were they local? Were they imported from another state? Were they farmed or foraged? Later in life she roamed the country in a pickup. (\u201cI wish my trucks could speak out some of the experiences they\u2019ve been through with me.\u201d) But when she first arrived in Mexico she travelled by bus, \u201cwith all the chickens and the pigs\u201d, moving from village to village, region to region, taking great interest in the way food was cooked, the specificities of the recipes to which she was being introduced. She asked question after question. What were the local chillies? What were the local fruits? What were the local herbs? She touched. She tasted. She inhaled \u2013 fragrances as well as knowledge. \u201cAnything to escape,\u201d she says in the documentary, \u201cand to learn.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be95cfc9dfb691a31bf6fb04f9d2da8db43db734\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be95cfc9dfb691a31bf6fb04f9d2da8db43db734/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Down Mexico way: inspecting the produce at a local market.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Down Mexico way: inspecting the produce at a local market.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dogwoof</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whenever possible, Kennedy would visit somewhere she had never been before, spending nights in the truck or, when the weather allowed, a hammock. She usually travelled alone. Sometimes she carried a tape recorder, sometimes a pistol. Nothing stopped her; her determination was unyielding. She would drive hundreds of miles in order to check a single fact \u2013 an ingredient, an exact measurement. In the foreword to <em>The Cuisines of Mexico</em>, the late food writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/feb/08/guardianobituaries2\" title=\"\">Craig Claiborne</a>, a close friend of Kennedy\u2019s, wrote, \u201cIf her enthusiasm were not beautiful, it would border on mania.\u201d She travelled compulsively, and she was always forthright and urgent, perhaps a little intrusive. \u201cI wanted to know where people lived. I wanted to learn what the landscape looked like. I wanted to know <em>more</em>.\u201d But people always responded generously. They were fascinated by her fascination. So they invited this odd Englishwoman into their kitchens, and she would stay for hours, or days, or even a week. \u201cI felt at home immediately,\u201d she says, \u201cwherever I went.\u201d She would record recipes faithfully \u2013 the specific ingredients and the precise measurements \u2013 and return to Michoac\u00e1n, laden with local specialities, to recreate them at home. Whenever she published a recipe, she always mentioned where it came from, and the woman who had shared it with her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a7636a5f44a96fb88f60ec0b3d328ab4a591db7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a7636a5f44a96fb88f60ec0b3d328ab4a591db7/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pot luck: trying out recipes at home, where she also held cookery classes for everyone from actors to renowned chefs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pot luck: trying out recipes at home, where she also held cookery classes for everyone from actors to renowned chefs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dogwoof</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kennedy first arrived in Mexico in 1957. She was born in Loughton, Essex, in 1923. After the Second World War she travelled to Jamaica, invited by a friend and \u201cpropelled by lots and lots of hormones\u201d, and then, impulsively, to Haiti. She landed during the revolution, along with several newspaper correspondents, including Paul Kennedy, a reporter with the <em>New York Times</em>. Paul was based in Mexico City. When he returned, Diana followed, \u201cand then began this absolutely fascinating time in love\u201d \u2013 with Paul, and then with the country that was now home. They married, and each time Paul left on a reporting trip, Diana left to explore her new world.</p> <p>Paul died in 1967, in New York, where they\u2019d gone so he could receive treatment for prostate cancer. In Manhattan, Diana felt out of her depth. She didn\u2019t know anyone. She was suddenly forced to hustle. She was \u201cterrifically depressed\u201d. Claiborne, the food writer, suggested she teach Mexican cooking, an idea she at first thought was crazy, but soon she was holding lessons in her apartment, \u201csix people in my little galley kitchen, cooking really traditional food. There was a dress designer, there was an actress. And here I was, teaching them how to make papadzules. I mean, hardly anyone in <em>Mexico</em> knew how to make papadzules. It was fun. It was a start.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK3UMhXQ1co\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JK3UMhXQ1co?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Later, an editor at Harper &amp; Row suggested she write a cookbook, which became <em>The Cuisines of Mexico</em>, and that\u2019s when the work really began. Other cookbooks followed \u2013 cultural studies, really \u2013 and then appearances on cooking shows (Martha Stewart <em>adored</em> her) and then cooking shows of her own. In front of a camera she was formidable: eager to share what she\u2019d discovered in Mexico but also slightly protective of it, and always straight-talking, almost to the point of rudeness. She would growl things like, \u201cPeople say they don\u2019t like cilantro. Please don\u2019t invite them!\u201d Or, \u201cGet some texture into your food. We don\u2019t want baby food all the time.\u201d Or, \u201cYou might not have a molcajete\u201d \u2013 a Mexican mortar and pestle, made of volcanic rock \u2013 \u201cso buy one!\u201d</p> <p>But the real work, the work she adored, was the travelling, using food as a way into people\u2019s lives \u2013 a \u201cdoctoral thesis performed in real time, in real life\u201d. She made the Michoac\u00e1n house her base. She didn\u2019t remarry. She never wanted children. (\u201cI don\u2019t want to bring up a little me. Can you imagine?\u201d). Instead, she gave herself to work. Carroll describes her as \u201can anthropologist of food\u201d who \u201chappens to be a killer cook\u201d. She has received heaps of awards, including the Order of the Aztec Eagle (big in Mexico), and a <a href=\"https://www.jamesbeard.org/awards\" title=\"\">James Beard Foundation Award</a> (big in food land). In 2002, Prince Charles visited Kennedy at her home to appoint her an MBE, for \u201cfurthering cultural relations between the UK and Mexico\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"140f2d207954827255dfbcc2364b32d867081bfd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/140f2d207954827255dfbcc2364b32d867081bfd/3_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Get some texture into your food\u2019: gathering produce from her garden.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Get some texture into your food\u2019: gathering produce from her garden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dogwoof</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Do these things matter to her? It\u2019s not clear. But legacy is important. In a scene from the documentary, Carroll films Kennedy running a cooking camp at her home. Some of the students are accomplished chefs. One owns three restaurants in Manhattan; another has five in Portland. But Kennedy is undaunted. At one point she moans: \u201cIt is absolutely appalling that Mexico is importing chillies,\u201d and admonishes chefs for not taking a stand. Later she half-shouts:\u201cLearn, learn, learn. Read my books and learn. What are you going to do when I\u2019m gone? Who is going to start screaming?\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a pressing question. Carroll filmed Kennedy over the course of six years, starting in 2013. \u201cWhen we first met her she was 91, running circles around us,\u201d Carroll says. \u201cShe was like, \u2018Get up, let\u2019s go to the market.\u2019 And we were like, \u2018This woman is three times our age!\u2019\u201d But by the end of filming, Kennedy had slowed, \u201cand you could see it was frustrating for her \u2013 that it\u2019s not the strength and energy she\u2019s been used to her whole life.\u201d When she spoke at a conference in 2013, Kennedy said, \u201cI am 90, so everybody gets very nervous, you see, that I\u2019m not going to be around much longer. So you\u2019ll want to hear all my complaints while I\u2019m alive.\u201d Recently those complaints have involved sustainability. \u201cWe live in such a diverse world,\u201d she says, \u201cand our education is so poor. How many kids at school realise how many insects there are? Millions and millions of different types, each playing their part in this marvellous universe.\u201d</p> <p>I was due to speak with Kennedy over the phone, but the call was delayed, and eventually cancelled. She is 97 now. Perhaps she has done all the talking she needs to do. Her legacy is assured. Her cookbooks are still in print. She is beloved by chefs, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/feb/09/chef-jose-andres-disaster-relief-puerto-rico\" title=\"\">Jo</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/feb/09/chef-jose-andres-disaster-relief-puerto-rico\" title=\"\">s\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s</a>, who calls her \u201cthe Indiana Jones of food\u201d. But \u201cit\u2019s not just rushing in, getting a recipe and coming out,\u201d Kennedy says. \u201cIt\u2019s recreating it in your own kitchen. How do you express this recipe so that people can do it, so that it won\u2019t be lost? God knows I tried.\u201d She adds, \u201cYou can\u2019t win them all. You just go on doing what you know you want to do, and at some point the tide will turn and you make your mark, or you may not\u2026 I\u2019m very honoured the way so many people do look at my books and appreciate what I\u2019ve done.

There\u2019s always a smattering of intellectual discourse on our walks, but lately the lighter banter has faded.</p> <p><strong>A special Sunday?</strong> On 26 April this year we were supposed to be in Santiago, Chile, to vote in a plebiscite on a new constitution. Of course, that was cancelled. We returned to the US in late February. I find myself in a strange situation: instead of voting on a constitution that will create more democracy, I\u2019m held hostage by a constitution that has allowed Donald Trump \u2013 a pathological liar \u2013 to become president of this republic despite losing the popular vote.</p> <p><strong>Sunday nights? </strong>Ang\u00e9lica and I lie in bed together, and I read to her. Mostly we revisit the classics: right now it\u2019s Dostoevsky\u2019s <em>The Possessed</em>. The art of writing literature is strange, you are creating spaces of encounter for others who\u2019ll find themselves in the space your words produce, but they are explored in solitude. Reading together is a way of enjoying new experiences with the love of my life, which has an added significance now our world has become so confined.</p> <p><em>Ariel Dorfman is a supporter of <a href=\"https://artistsatrisk.org/about/?lang=en\" title=\"\">Artists at Risk</a>\u2019s Covid-19 Emergency Fund</em></p>",

  "<p>Two months have passed since Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary-general, called on warring parties around the world to lay down their weapons and help fight another battle \u2013 against Covid-19. \u201cThe fury of the virus illustrates the folly of war,\u201d Guterres said. \u201cThat is why I am calling for an immediate <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/03/1059972\">global ceasefire </a>\u2026 It is time to put armed conflict on lockdown.\u201d <br><br>This was and remains an entirely sensible idea. The UN leader\u2019s appeal received strong support from civil society groups, charities, churches and human rights organisations. In Colombia, the Philippines and South Sudan, armed groups initially heeded his call. But to their great shame, the US, China and Russia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/un-ceasefire-resolution-us-blocks-who\">blocked the plan </a>in the UN security council. They continue to do so.<br></p> <p>Those who suggest a global ceasefire would be a merely symbolic gesture should listen to the Norwegian Refugee Council.

Failed ceasefires in Yemen, Libya and Afghanistan continue to take a dreadful daily toll of civilian lives.<br><br>\u201cThis not only hurts those who are forced to flee. It seriously undermines joint efforts to combat the virus,\u201d said the NRC\u2019s chief, Jan Egeland. \u201cWhile people are being displaced and killed, powerful members of the UN security council <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/world/un-security-council-fails-support-global-ceasefire-shows-no-response-covid-19\">squabble </a>like children in a sandbox. World leaders must unite in protecting all communities from Covid-19.\u201d<br><br>Donald Trump\u2019s objections to a ceasefire resolution, repeatedly proposed and delayed in recent weeks, have nothing to do with war or virus-related suffering, to which he appears indifferent. Trump dislikes the fact that the latest draft refers, indirectly, to the World Health Organization \u2013 with which he is irrationally feuding as part of his China virus vendetta.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This pathetic inability on the part of the world\u2019s great powers to show leadership, compassion and common sense is dangerous and disheartening</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><br><br>The US had previously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/19/us-and-russia-blocking-un-plans-for-a-global-ceasefire-amid-crisis\">objected </a>on the grounds that a global ceasefire might inhibit its ability to interdict terrorists, a concern echoed by Russia vis-\u00e0-vis its military operations in Syria.

The result: stalemate.<br></p> <p>This pathetic inability on the part of the world\u2019s great powers to show leadership, compassion and common sense at a time of global emergency is dangerous and disheartening.

This way lies the complete breakdown of international co-operation.<br><br>As ever, it will not be they who pay the price. The momentum generated by Guterres\u2019s inspirational call has begun to dissipate. The situation in several conflict zones has even begun to get worse. Northern Yemen is a case in point.

By the same measure, \u201cpolitics can change a culture and save it from itself\u201d.</p> <p>Frum criticizes the effective disenfranchisement wrought by the electoral college but does not call for its abolition.

Still, Frum\u2019s dismay is not directed at the president\u2019s supporters, at least he tries not to. Frum understands that even if the incumbent loses re-election, the great American divide is not disappearing anytime soon.</p> <p>On that note, Trumpocalypse rejects progressivism\u2019s embrace of the \u201cGreat Awokening\u201d, the volatile brew of identity politics and intersectionality.

Unsurprisingly, many of these revolved around allegations that the PM\u2019s advisor Dominic Cummings broke the lockdown rules back in March. Here\u2019s a summary of the key points:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The government has announced it will put \u00a3283m into moving public transport back to a full timetable</strong>. However, those who can should still work from home, and those who can should still avoid all forms of public transport. Even a fully restored service will only be capable of carrying, at best, one fifth of normal capacity, to allow for social distancing. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>There have been a further 282 recorded deaths, bringing the UK\u2019s total death toll to 36,675</strong>. Important to note - the government publishes the death toll based on those who definitely had Covid-19; broader figures based on suspected coronavirus deaths is larger. On average, the number of deaths is starting to come down, Harries said. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The \u201csteady, slow\u201d <strong>downward trend in hospital admissions in England is continuing</strong>. Across all four nations, the percentage of mechanical ventilator beds occupied by patients with Covid-19 is also falling.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Testing for under 5s will be \u201cprogressed\u201d going forward</strong>, said Harries, after a question on whether they\u2019ll be able to get tested once early years facilities are reopened. Harries said it is known that children rarely become ill with Covid-19 and there are signals that the transmission from children is reduced.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <h2><strong>Shapps was grilled on Cummings</strong></h2> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Shapps dodged a question on whether or not the PM knew of Dominic Cummings\u2019 400km journey, simply saying: \u201cthe important thing is that everyone remains in the same place whilst they are in lockdown\u201d. He also said the welfare of Cummings\u2019 4 year old child was \u201cthe important thing\u201d - this is a reference to the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iainjwatson/status/1264124644191277057\">explanation</a> given by Downing Street for Cummings\u2019 journey.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The PM gives Cummings his full support.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Asked if, like Cummings, those who become ill with the virus can go closer to relatives, Shapps says if you\u2019re symptomatic, you have to get yourself locked down in the most practical way, and that this will be different depending on different family circumstances.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>If you want more detail, you can read some of the exchanges <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/23/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-under-pressure-to-sack-dominic-cummings-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ec942418f0886ce4f5d91c7#block-5ec942418f0886ce4f5d91c7\">here </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/23/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-under-pressure-to-sack-dominic-cummings-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ec940278f0864e579f167ae#block-5ec940278f0864e579f167ae\">here</a>.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-23T19:51:23.657Z\">at 8.51pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec9498f8f0886ce4f5d91fc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-23T16:06:59.567Z\">5.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The death toll in <strong>Italy </strong>has risen by 119 to 32,735, the third highest in the world after the US and the UK.</p> \n  <p>There have been another 669 confirmed cases, taking the total to 229,372, the sixth highest global tally behind those of the US, Russia, Spain, Britain and Brazil.

Early analysis by WHO suggests that Africa\u2019s lower mortality rate may be the result of demography and other possible factors. Africa is the youngest continent demographically, with more than 60% of the population under the age of 25. Older adults have a significantly increased risk of developing a severe illness. In Europe nearly 95% of deaths occurred in those older than 60 years.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>WHO also noted that African governments swiftly imposed restrictive measures on their populations in an attempt to contain the spread of the disease.

To recap the latest developments around the world:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>About 1.8bn Muslims worldwide will celebrate one of their biggest holidays, the three-day Eid al-Fitr, largely confined to their home. The celebration marks the end of the fasting month of Ramadan, and usually involves travelling, visiting family and gathering for lavish meals, all of which will be largely prohibited as authorities try to prevent virus outbreaks. </li> \n   <li>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/22/hydroxychloroquine-trumps-covid-19-cure-increases-deaths-global-study-finds\">another study has shown that the anti-malarial drug the US president,<strong> Donald Trump,</strong> is taking</a> to prevent Covid-19 has increased deaths in patients treated with it in hospitals around the world. It follows a<a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20065920v2\"> study published in April that showed hospital patients given hydroxychloroquine</a> in the US found no benefit from the drug, either alone or given in combination with an antibiotic. In fact the patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone had a higher mortality rate.</li> \n   <li>Still in the US, in yet another attack on media Trump called the editor of the New York Times \u201cone of the dumbest men\u201d in journalism, and as CNN\u2019s fact-checker has noted, this is the third time in the last month he has called a prominent black journalist \u201cdumb\u201d. He also spent his Friday evening attacking his former attorney general, <strong>Jeff Sessions, </strong>on Twitter. Trump declared churches, mosques and synagogues \u201cessential services\u201d and threatened to override governors who refuse to reopen them this weekend \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/22/donald-trump-churches-mosques-synagogues-reopen\">a power he does not possess</a>.</li> \n   <li>In Russia, the Chechen leader,<strong> Ramzan Kadyrov</strong>,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/22/ramzan-kadyrov-vanishes-amid-reports-he-has-coronavirus\"> is being treated for Covid-19 in Moscow</a>.

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/22/jobkeeper-to-cost-60bn-less-than-originally-forecast-due-to-reporting-error\">error between the number of employees businesses estimated would be covered by the scheme and the actual number receiving the payment means the scheme will cover 3.5m workers, down from 6.5m</a>. It will also cost about $70bn, not $130bn. The government is so far resisting calls from Labor to extend the payment to casuals and those workers who were not eligible for the payment.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-23T00:32:22.499Z\">at 1.32am BST</time></p> \n</div>"
