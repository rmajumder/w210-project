coronavirus by people with no symptoms is \u201cvery rare\u201d, saying this guidance could pose problems for governments as they seek to lift lockdowns, <strong>Reuters</strong> reports. </p> <p> Maria van Kerkhove, an epidemiologist and the WHO\u2019s technical lead on the Covid-19 pandemic, said on Monday that many countries undertaking contact tracing had identified asymptomatic cases, but were not finding they caused further spread of the virus. \u201cIt is very rare,\u201d she said. </p> <p> \u201cI was quite surprised by the WHO statement,\u201d said Liam Smeeth, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who added that he had not seen the data Kerkhove\u2019s statement was based on. </p> <p> \u201cIt goes against my impressions from the science so far that suggest asymptomatic people \u2013 who never get symptoms \u2013 and pre-symptomatic people are an important source of infection to others.\u201d </p> <p>Smeeth and other experts said understanding the risks of transmission among people with mild or no symptoms is crucial as governments begin to ease the lockdown measures they imposed to try and reduce the pandemic\u2019s spread and gradually replace them with case tracking and isolation plans. <br></p> <p> \u201cThis has important implications for the track/trace/isolate measures being instituted in many countries,\u201d said Babak Javid, a Cambridge University Hospitals infectious diseases consultant. </p> <p>The co-head of Singapore\u2019s coronavirus taskforce told Reuters on Monday there had been asymptomatic transmission cases there, between people living in close quarters. However, China said last week that 300 symptomless coronavirus carriers in its central city of Wuhan, the pandemic\u2019s epicentre, had not been found to be infectious. </p> <p> Keith Neal, a professor of the epidemiology of infectious diseases at Britain\u2019s University of Nottingham, said that while the question of how big a role asymptomatic transmission plays in new infections is unclear, what is known is that people with symptoms are responsible for most of the spread of the disease. </p> <p> \u201cThis reinforces the importance of any person who has any of the symptoms of Covid-19 arranges a test .\u2026 as soon as possible and isolating until they get their test result,\u201d he said. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-09T12:24:18.754Z\">at 1.24pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5edf72428f083999a26dd07b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-09T11:42:19.983Z\">12.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hundreds more fatalities from Covid-19 in the north-west of <strong>England</strong> and in care homes have driven up the number of excess deaths since the <strong>UK</strong> went into lockdown to more than 63,000, a toll believed to be greater than those anywhere else except the US, writes <strong>Robert Booth</strong>, the Guardian\u2019s social affairs correspondent, in London. </p> <p>The number of deaths from the virus in England and Wales fell to 1,822 in the last week of May, the fewest for eight weeks, according to the latest data from the Office of National Statistics.

Many economists believe the pandemic will push the German economy into its biggest decline since the end of the second world war in the second quarter.</p> <p>Seasonally adjusted exports fell 24% on the month while imports slid by 16.5%. The trade surplus shrank to \u20ac3.2bn, the federal statistics office said. Economists polled by Reuters had expected exports to fall by 15.6% and saw imports down 16%. The trade surplus was expected to come in at \u20ac10bn.</p> <p>Alexander Krueger, an economist at Bankhaus Lampe, said a recovery may have already started due to a loosening of the lockdown and reopening of borders, but little was left of the last decade\u2019s export boom. \u201cThe road out of the corona trough is long, rocky and above all uncertain, especially for foreign trade,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Despite a \u20ac130bn stimulus package announced last week, which comes on top of \u20ac750bn worth of measures announced in March, the government expects the economy to shrink by 6.3% this year. Economists expect a slow recovery and the pace will depend largely on how fast Germany\u2019s European neighbours and other trade partners, including China and the US, emerge from the crisis.</p> <p>Exports to France and the US, hit hard by the coronavirus, fell most while those to China, which was first affected by the virus but which has since started to see some signs of recovery, fell slightly less sharply, the office said.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-09T07:06:53.637Z\">at 8.06am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5edf2e208f0883ec2fc1d94a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-09T06:41:24.053Z\">7.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>China\u2019s</strong> education ministry has warned that Chinese students should consider whether to study in <strong>Australia</strong>, amid escalating tensions between Beijing and Canberra, Reuters reports.

The effect of the toppling of Edward Colston\u2019s statue in Bristol on Sunday rippled across the country, with hundreds of local authorities now expected to consider renaming public monuments.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Museum for London said it was working with partners to remove the statue of 18th century slave owner Robert Milligan</strong>. The monument has become a focus of protest since it was targeted at the weekend.</li> \n   <li><strong>A statue of King Leopold II in Belgium was taken down after being vandalised and set on fire by protesters</strong>.

On reflection I think this attitude was probably a fault and an act of complicity in allowing the damage of Rhodes\u2019 actions during his lifetime, and the century of their legacy to go unchallenged. I believe now is the time to remove the statue from the college and that is it is in all our interest that is done proactively and peacefully.

  "<p>Instant Influencer, a new competition to find YouTube\u2019s next viral make-up vlogger, might be 2020\u2019s most transparent reality show. Even for those completely horrified by every second word in that sentence, it\u2019s a fascinating insight into a billion-dollar industry \u2013 both a completely vapid and endlessly interesting watch, bingeable in a night. Forget MasterChef: who knew video editing to a time limit could be so suspenseful?</p> <p>For once, contestants don\u2019t have to feign interest in finding love and can be honest about the end goal: selling #spon on social media. Again and again across its four episodes and without any hint of self-awareness, the six contestants say they need to prove their talents as an influencer and an artist, always in that order. It would be depressing if it wasn\u2019t so absorbing.</p> <p>Created by YouTube and filmed in its shiny LA studios, Instant Influencer very much is made within the machine, served with little snark. If anything, it\u2019s a bold new frontier for beauty vlogging \u2013 a meta, high-budget series packed with product placement and uploaded for free to the page of host and vlogger James Charles.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSC2q1Q-7KM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sSC2q1Q-7KM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>A meta, high-budget series served with little snark.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Even if you consider yourself influencer illiterate, chances are Charles will have seeped his way into your world. With an estimated net worth of US$12-22 million, he\u2019s one of the beauty world\u2019s premier influencers, either most famous for becoming CoverGirl\u2019s first male spokesperson at age 17 or his feud with fellow YouTuber Tati Westbrook last year. The petty back-and-forth of 40-minute \u201cexpos\u00e9\u201d videos about minor grievances saw him lose 4m followers in a week, and was covered across otherwise influencer-averse mastheads.</p> <p>Instant Influencer is as much a branding exercise for the contestants as it is a post-cancellation rebranding for Charles, who moves into a mentor role at 21. As per the awkward eliminations where Charles asks crying contestants to \u201csign off\u201d, \u201cas if it was a regular video\u201d, it isn\u2019t the most natural fit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jun/08/the-comeback-lisa-kudrow-is-perfect-in-hilarious-biting-and-deeply-meta-satire\">The Comeback: Lisa Kudrow is perfect in hilarious, biting and deeply meta satire</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Judges \u2013 Charles and a series of rotating beauty and influencer figures, including drag queen Trixie Mattel, cosmetics company Anastasia Beverly Hills president Norvina and \u201coriginal influencer\u201d Paris Hilton \u2013 evaluate a video\u2019s clickability off its title, thumbnail and potential for virality. The genuine make-up artistry on display is an aside: instead, it\u2019s about how they sell the look rather than the look itself, a completely new set of skills to test on reality TV.</p> <p>Across the season, the contestants are put through challenges that loosely recreate Charles\u2019s career, similar to<em> </em>RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race or America\u2019s Next Top Model. They manufacture the next big viral makeup challenge, collaborate with famous influencers and make sponsored videos for products, even if they\u2019ve never used them \u2013 a fact that lingers but is never directly confronted. The stand-out, though, is the apology video challenge, something Charles is well-versed in.</p> <p>It\u2019s bone-chilling to hear Charles applaud how the \u201chonesty and message came through\u2019\u2019 in an apology for something the contestants haven\u2019t done, like using overtly clickbait titles or monetising their previous apology video. The fact that this is a performance of accountability is never addressed. Neither are the contestants\u2019 archetypal personalities \u2013 the shy goth girl, the adorkable babbler, the loud baby gay, and the ice-cool queen.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b971d76bafb26d50cc090ccff4603a187df89ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b971d76bafb26d50cc090ccff4603a187df89ee/41_0_1049_629/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Instant Influencer contestants in their first look\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Instant Influencer contestants in their first look.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: YouTube</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Charles\u2019s catchphrase on the show is \u201cblend but don\u2019t blend in\u201d, but aside from their personal traumas, which are readily revealed as we meet them, most contestants are fairly indistinguishable. Beauty vlogging celebrates diversity (or, at least, sells it as a point-of-difference between channels), and the cast reflects that. Still, there\u2019s little discussion of how their identities \u2013 whether a straight cis white woman, black single mother, or a queer child of a recently deported immigrant \u2013 inform either their make-up or dreams of being an influencer beyond same-same speeches of how make-up lets them be \u201cwho they are\u201d.</p> <p>Each contestant\u2019s makeup speaks far more to their creativity than their personas, which have been squished into YouTube catchphrases and slang ripped straight from other influencers, who ripped it from ballroom culture. They\u2019ve eroded their personalities for the algorithm. Some break through for \u201cgenuine moments\u201d, but others, like the 18-year-old contestant who has clearly grown up watching Charles and co, are stuck in a \u201cyas queen\u201d loop.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jun/03/technique-critique-indulgently-addictive-web-series-dissects-your-favourite-performances\">Technique Critique: indulgently addictive web series dissects your favourite performances</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Still, it\u2019s a perverse joy to watch the best influencers effortlessly master the game, as they nail the balance between banal banter, \u201craw\u201d moments and \u201cindividuality\u201d that\u2019s still relatable to as many as possible. There\u2019s officially only one winner, but everyone walks away with an experience to make content from and grow their audience: nobody loses.</p> <p>You could say it\u2019s a sad reality that these artists feel like YouTube celebrity is their only path forward. But Instant Influencer is merely a bizarre microcosm of what most musicians or creatives face without a stable industry, as they regrettably have to build up their brand before their art.</p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtlV6iOFdL-xf_pkAq_BMZ5PKSFzt4Rxd\">Instant Influencer</a> is available to stream on YouTube</em></p>",

The details were first published by the Austin American-Statesman newspaper and KVUE-TV.</p> <p>Ambler got out of the car and showed his hands, according to the report, but then moved towards the car and was tasered by JJ Johnson, a black Williamson county deputy who was being filmed at the time by a camera crew from Live PD, a real-time police TV show, although the footage was not aired.</p> <p>Another, white, police officer arrived and Ambler was hit with a taser a further two times. An Austin police officer arrived at the scene as the officers struggled to handcuff Ambler.

Valenzuela, who was also tasered twice by police, became unresponsive and paramedics were unable to save him at the scene.</p> <p>An autopsy returned on Thursday showed that Valenzuela died from asphyxial injuries from the chokehold.

It is history | David Olusoga</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despair, pain and anger have been running high within black communities.

These terrible events have ignited much more than mass demonstrations: they have triggered feelings that many within black communities have been suppressing for a long time, in order to simply be able to carry on living their lives. The issue of <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/lifestyle/lifestyle-buzz/what-does-intergenerational-trauma-and-healing-look-like-for-black-women/ar-BBVfjnZ\">intergenerational trauma</a> that is often explored when studying the history of slavery has resurfaced in the most violent way. </p> <p>What these killings and subsequent protests have also captured are the chaotic ways most former colonial powers have been avoiding an honest reckoning with the impact of the past. This is a story of the legacies that have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/27/racism-british-society-minority-ethnic-people-dying-excessive-force\">shaped societies</a> in the most dramatic way, putting black and brown people at the bottom of the social ladder. It is about the many forms of racism that have led to discriminatory practices. These have, in turn, prevented large swathes of society from having access to decent jobs or the ability to benefit from social mobility. Floyd\u2019s death has pushed people into uncomfortable trenches, where they must reckon with a difficult history.&nbsp;</p> <p>In Britain, the death and protests were also followed by a mass show of solidarity from institutions and companies around the country. That seemed like a positive step \u2013 but it was also incredibly puzzling for those of us who have long been fighting for racial equality. Some of these institutions are routinely accused of lacking a multiracial representation among their staff members \u2013 while others continually fail to address endemic racism.</p> <p>The dissonance between these performative shows of solidarity and the inability to connect what was happening in the US with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/03/racism-george-floyd-britain-america-uk-black-people\">Britain\u2019s own history of discrimination</a> was uncanny. The disingenuous argument often used is that Britain doesn\u2019t have the same record of police brutality \u2013 or that a series of race relations acts are proof that the UK is committed to racial equality.</p> <p>What is striking here is the failure to make a link between numerous pressing issues: the dispute over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/06/labour-accuses-government-of-cover-up-over-bame-covid-19-report\">the release and findings</a> of Public Health England\u2019s report on the high number of coronavirus deaths within BAME communities; the ongoing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/28/windrush-scandal-only-60-victims-given-compensation-so-far\">Windrush scandal</a>; the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/08/commonwealth-veterans-accuse-uk-immigration-limbo-home-office-mod\">hostile environment</a> and its <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52900700\">inner contradictions</a>; the lack of support for victims of the Grenfell fire; the resistance to teaching British black history and the continued glorification of the British empire\u2019s legacies. Each deserves a full article, but let us try to disentangle the racialised knot at the heart of these stories and their links with policing black and brown bodies. Let us start by setting the record straight.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/04/systemic-racism-police-brutality-british-problems-black-lives-matter\">Police brutality towards black people</a> \u2013 as well as against Asian and other minority ethnic groups \u2013 has taken many forms over decades in Britain. We all remember the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/22/macpherson-report-what-was-it-and-what-impact-did-it-have\">Macpherson </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/22/macpherson-report-what-was-it-and-what-impact-did-it-have\">report</a> from 1999, following the murder of Stephen Lawrence in 1993, that established that the Metropolitan police was institutionally racist. Since then, several groups have done a tremendous amount of work to bridge the gap between communities and police forces. Yet trust still needs to be built \u2013 and police forces still lack officers from minority ethnic communities. Government austerity cuts have further eroded efforts to tackle this imbalance. In recent months we have even seen <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-52905787\">excessive fines</a> against BAME groups for breaching lockdown rules during the pandemic.</p> <p>Yet the issue at the heart of our current situation is not the police, but poverty, exclusion, and accepted institutionalised and <a href=\"https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/understanding-everyday-racism/book3570\">everyday racism</a>. This has led many in the majority group to view black people as either exceptional \u2013 the \u201cchosen one\u201d who has shown remarkable abilities and therefore deserves to be praised \u2013 or as a criminal, a member of the <a href=\"https://cup.columbia.edu/book/race-and-the-undeserving-poor/9781788210386\">undeserving poor</a>, or finally as a foreigner, even when their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/21/windrush-institutional-racism-hostile-environment\">ancestors have contributed</a> to the wealth of this nation.&nbsp;</p> <p>How do we move past the current dangerous moment where young black people are caught up in places of despair and rage? How do we offer a potential for hope? Some argue that we can\u2019t fix <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/dr-cornel-west-on-whether-us-can-break-down-racial-barriers\">a system that isn\u2019t working</a> and that the police should be abolished; others support the idea that local and community collective endeavours are the answer to failed leadership. My belief is that governments, institutions and organisations have a lot to learn from those grassroots movements. The task is enormous but let us imagine how genuine joint efforts could transform our cities, towns and country.&nbsp;</p> <p>People in cities have already shown that they can take this difficult history into their own hands. On Sunday, those protesters in Bristol toppled the statue of Edward Colston, responsible for the transportation of nearly 85,000 African captives in the late 17th century.</p> <p>The statue was erected in 1895, long after his death, in honour of Colston\u2019s philanthropic deeds towards parts of the community in Bristol. He was for generations of Bristolians one of the fathers of the city. However, the presence of the statue has been a source of division for many years, with previous efforts to have the statue removed continuously stalled. At the weekend, young people removed the bronze statue in the most dramatic way and then threw it into the harbour, to cheers from onlookers.

In the Covid-19 crisis it only took the month of April to get practically the same result. In March and April, exports have now shrunk by almost 36%. The export sector is probably the most exposed to the crisis, suffering from the domestic lockdown measures as much as from lockdowns across the world and supply chain disruptions.</p> <p>Looking ahead, while April was the worst month ever in terms of most economic data releases, the month of May could become one of the best months ever.</p> <p>With the worst now behind us, things will start to brighten. In past recoveries, the German economy could always count on exports to kickstart the recovery. After the 2008/9 crisis, it was the Asian countries and strong demand for German investment goods which helped the German economy to overcome the recession swiftly.

  "<p>If you were going to write a novel about a bigoted southern Republican senator eager to turn the US into a military dictatorship, it would feel heavy-handed to name the protagonist Tom Cotton. The only thing less subtle, perhaps, would be calling him Tommy Plantation.</p> <p>But this is real life, I am afraid, not a dystopian novel \u2013 and real life in 2020 does not seem interested in subtlety. Nor does Cotton. The Arkansas senator attracted ire last week for a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/opinion/tom-cotton-protests-military.html\">column</a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/opinion/tom-cotton-protests-military.html\"> he wrote in the New York Times</a>&nbsp;urging that&nbsp;the military be brought in to deal with protests against police brutality. \u201cSend in the troops,\u201d the headline bluntly declared. \u201cThe nation must restore order,\u201d it continued. Nothing says \u201cland of the free\u201d like turning your troops on your own people.&nbsp;</p> <p>Cotton wanted a coup and he got one. After&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jun/05/new-york-times-says-tom-cotton-opinion-piece-did-not-meet-editorial-standards\">widespread criticism of the article</a>, including from Times journalists who argued it endangered the safety of black employees, the paper issued an apology; James Bennet, its editorial page editor, who had originally defended the decision to publish,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jun/07/new-york-times-editor-resigns-tom-cotton-oped-protests\">resigned</a>.</p> <p>The turmoil seems to have played well for Cotton, <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sen-tom-cotton-blasts-ny-times-for-caving-to-woke-child-mob-of-staffers-over-op-ed\">who went on Fox News on&nbsp;Sunday</a>&nbsp;to criticise the paper for caving to the \u201cwoke child mob\u201d (which would make a great name for a punk band). According to a Washington Post reporter, Cotton has \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/daveweigel/status/1269792011361628162?s=20\">quintupled his fundraising</a>\u201d since the fracas started. He has also garnered the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1269733556865118211?s=20\">public approval of Donald Trump</a>.</p> <p>Cotton\u2019s moment in the spotlight has passed \u2013 but he will almost certainly be back there soon. Despite having the charisma of a soggy bag of lettuce, the senator is hugely powerful: Cotton has influenced&nbsp;many of Trump\u2019s decisions, including&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/immigration-trump-senate-cotton-234706\">cuts to legal immigration</a> and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cotton.senate.gov/?p=press_release&amp;id=1307\">banning of commercial flights between the US and China</a>&nbsp;during the early days of Covid-19. He is also the guy who told Trump it would be a great idea to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/22/politics/tom-cotton-buy-greenland-idea-trump/index.html\">buy Greenland</a>. When not urging the acquisition of the world\u2019s largest island, Cotton can often be found fanning the flames of racism and xenophobia. He has repeatedly used the phrases&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thv11.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/senator-tom-cotton-coronavirus-china-virus-racism/91-73ff6efc-7c28-4fd9-a4f4-d6c44bd8368f\">\u201cChina virus\u201d</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cotton.senate.gov/?p=press_release&amp;id=1352\">\u201cWuhan virus\u201d</a>&nbsp;and has floated the conspiracy theory that Covid-19 was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/11/republican-tom-cotton-coronavirus-china\">created by the&nbsp;Chinese government in a weapons lab</a>.</p> <p>Cotton may look like an American Alan Partridge, but he is no buffoon; he is a dangerous man with dangerous ambitions. Indeed, a number of experts believe he is angling&nbsp;to be <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/sen-tom-cottons-next-mission-carrying-trump-banner-after-trump-11591542001\">the heir to Trumpism</a>. His popularity among conservative activists seems to have been boosted by the Times controversy and it looks increasingly likely he will be a <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/making-the-right-enemies-puts-tom-cotton-on-inside-track-in-fox-gop-primary-for-2024-2020-06-07\">Republican presidential contender in 2024</a>.</p> <p>The idea of a President Cotton should terrify us all. Cotton has Trump\u2019s&nbsp;appetite for authoritarianism and a similar disdain for a free press \u2013 in&nbsp;2006, while&nbsp;serving in Iraq, Cotton wrote an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/politics/soapbox/tomcotton.asp\">open letter</a>&nbsp;calling for the prosecution of two Times reporters who had broken a story about a secret government programme. He appeals to the Trump wing of the Republican party, but, crucially, he also has strong ties with the establishment. \u201cHow many guys in town can give a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations and also get kudos in the pages of Breitbart?\u201d&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/13/is-tom-cotton-the-future-of-trumpism\">Steve Bannon asked the New Yorker in 2017</a>. \u201cThe answer is, one guy.\u201d That guy? Cotton.</p> <p>We will eventually see the end of Trump\u2019s presidency, but it will be far harder to get rid of Trumpism. The question is: how will Trump\u2019s legacy evolve? Will it fade into the fringes or take on a more serious, more sinister, facade? Trumpism is largely defined by incompetence and farce, but Cotton could spin it into something a lot more terrifying and even more tragic.</p> <ul> <li><p>Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>",

Last week, chat service Slack <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/jgxma3/slack-blog-post-worked-with-police\">removed a blog post</a> showing how local police forces can use the app after some Black employees criticized it.

  "<p>Fish and chips with a side order of mushy peas has been a Friday night tradition for generations. A Jewish immigrant, Joseph Malin, opened the first recorded fish and chip shop in London in 1860 and dedicated takeaways have been serving customers ever since.</p> <p>Yet despite this heritage, if you choose battered cod, plaice or haddock to soak up your vinegar, it\u2019s unlikely to have been fished from UK waters: the majority of the cod and haddock we buy is imported from the Barents Sea or around Norway or Iceland.</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.seafish.org/article/sea-for-yourself\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sea For Yourself</a> campaign, which is largely funded by Defra and aims to inspire the UK to eat seafood caught in UK waters, close to half of adults would buy more seafood if they knew it was caught locally. The good news is that if you\u2019re keen to eat more seafood that\u2019s been caught closer to home, there\u2019s a wealth of alternatives to choose from.</p> <p>We know fish is good for us and the catches found in our waters, from mussels, oysters and crab, to oil-rich mackerel and flaky lemon sole, are a great source of protein, vitamins and minerals. The NHS recommends that we should all enjoy at least two portions of fish a week, one of which should be an oil-rich variety.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"335f8ace768e08b47358b25604c82330856531fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/335f8ace768e08b47358b25604c82330856531fe/0_151_1998_1199/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two mackerel on blue wooden background, close up\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fish such as mackerel are rich in oils.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Foodcollection RF/Getty Images/Foodcollection</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cMost of us are familiar with nutrition advice that encourages us to eat a wide variety of fruit and vegetables for optimal health, and it\u2019s the same when it comes to seafood,\u201d says Juliette Kellow, consultant nutritionist at Seafish, a non-departmental public body set up to support the UK seafood industry and funded mainly by a levy on all first-hand purchases of seafood products in the UK, including imported seafood. \u201cMany varieties of fish provide a range of B vitamins, which help fight fatigue for those of us always on the go.</p> <p>\u201cIncorporating fish such as herring, coley or hake, and shellfish like crab and mussels into your diet is smart, as they provide a great source of protein and allow you to make the most of all the health benefits seafood offers.\u201d When you\u2019re trying to get more variety into your diet, it makes sense to try something new.</p> <p>Trying a wide variety of fish dishes instead of sticking to well-worn favourites supports UK fishermen, helps stocks stay sustainable and keeps your mealtimes creative \u2013 because of course, the real beauty of seafood is its endless versatility.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/labs/2020/omnigov/fish/index.html\" data-alt=\"Fish by numbers\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/labs/2020/omnigov/fish/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fish by numbers</a> </figure>  <p>Four in 10 of us claim we\u2019d be more likely to cook seafood at home if we felt more confident using it in the kitchen, and whipping up a Friday night fish supper \u2013 whether you\u2019re angling for a pile of battered monkfish bites, a plate of simply dressed devilled herrings or a steaming bowl of moules marinie\u0300re \u2013 is a lot easier than you might think.</p> <p>If a fish and chip supper is non-negotiable on a Friday night, beer-battered dover sole is a delicious alternative to cod, while shellfish is a great choice if you\u2019re bored with chicken and looking for an alternative source of low-fat protein.</p> <p>In warmer weather, go for fresh hake with seasonal asparagus and Jersey Royals, or a poached hake salade nic\u0327oise. For something a bit different, crab thermidor is surprisingly quick to make, while fish tacos made with coley goujons make the ideal bite for sharing in front of the TV. Fresh oysters on ice or spiced coconut mussels are perfect for impressing. When the weather cools down, there\u2019s a wealth of winter warmers to choose, from roast hake with curried stew to smoked mackerel risotto.</p> <p>Plenty of seafood dishes are surprisingly quick to pull together. Monkfish and coconut curry takes about 15 minutes to prepare, while an Asian-spiced crab and noodle salad with black sesame seed dressing can be on the table in 10 minutes flat. Children love fish too, which is always a bonus when faced with picky eaters \u2013 coley goujons instead of fish fingers, or mackerel fishcakes made with mash are easy weekday crowd-pleasers.</p> <p>We all have a favourite fish, and when you\u2019re seafood savvy it\u2019s not hard to find an often-overlooked alternative to your usual choice \u2013 from soft, flaky flounder to firm, boldly flavoured sprats or rainbow trout.</p> <p>With so much choice, you may struggle to decide what to cook, but to make things a bit easier, Seafish has created a website so you can arrange for the best of UK seafood to be delivered to your door.

The report found the institutions had relatively slim cash reserves to weather a major downturn in revenue due to a falloff in international students. Some universities derive up to 36% of their revenues from international students.</p> <p>The modelling undertaken by Universities Australia assumed that international student numbers would recover to their pre-pandemic numbers by 2022. Based on a 20% drop in international enrolments this year, the study estimated a $3.3bn drop in revenue, rising to a $4.3bn loss with a further 20% drop in 2021.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/31/we-poked-the-bear-australian-farmers-take-the-china-trade-stoush-in-their-stride\">'We poked the bear': Australian farmers take the China trade stoush in their stride</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The University of NSW, which has one of the largest exposures to international students, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/04/australian-universities-to-close-campuses-and-shed-thousands-of-jobs-as-revenue-plummets-due-to-covid-19-crisis\">has estimated its losses at up to $600m</a> in 2020 (from a budget of $2bn), with possible losses of $450m in 2021 and again in 2022.</p> <p>The trade minister, Simon Birmingham, has rejected China\u2019s warnings to its citizens not to travel to Australia due to a \u201csignificant\u201d increase in racist attacks since the coronavirus outbreak.</p> <p>Labor\u2019s deputy leader, Richard Marles, said on Sunday Australia was \u201cclearly not free from the issue of&nbsp;racism, and I\u2019m sure that there are Chinese Australians who have been on&nbsp;the receiving end of that\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBut I&nbsp;think the way in which that statement is framed [by the foreign ministry] does not&nbsp;accurately describe where Australia&nbsp;is at\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/01/anti-asian-racism-surges-in-nsw-during-coronavirus-pandemic\">Anti-Discrimination New South Wales reported</a> it had received an increase in inquiries \u201crelated to the pandemic and racism against people of Asian backgrounds\u201d between January and April 2020 and a community database that tracks anti-Asian racism has received 380 reports in two months \u2013&nbsp;the equivalent of 47 a week.</p>",

results were better than expected).</p> \n  <p>The Covid-19 committee then heard from the ATO commissioner, <strong>Chris Jordan</strong>, on the second error \u2013 that the ATO believed many more employees were covered due to errors in employers\u2019 responses.</p> \n  <p>Jordan said a small number of the 900,000 businesses made errors such as putting their phone numbers, ABN or bank account details into the employees-covered field, and some put in 1,500 or multiples of 1,500. </p> \n  <p>He said 0.1% of employers appeared to think the field was asking for \u201cthe amount payable to, rather than the number of employees\u201d.</p> \n  <p>He said many categories of error were picked up but:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>We did not build rigorous analytics behind that field that asked for the estimated number of employees that businesses had [claimed for].</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Jordan said the ATO told treasury about the error on 21 May, before the public update on 22 May.</p> \n  <p>Explaining why it took so long to detect, the ATO said the numbers enrolling in jobkeeper \u201cseemed to be on trajectory consistent with estimates ... but once [we] began to confirm employees covered, we identified within a fortnight the numbers were less than expected\u201d.</p> \n  <p>The ATO conducted outreach to big employers and believed the discrepancy was due to big employers not completing the second stage of their application (confirming which employees they were claiming for). Eventually, it \u201cbecame evident\u201d there was another factor: the employers mis-entering the number of employees. </p> \n  <p>Jordan said this \u201ctemporarily obscured the size of a demand driven program\u201d but did not result in incorrect payments.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-09T02:45:47.392Z\">at 3.45am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5edef0808f083999a26dcb7b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/paul-karp\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-09T02:15:22.707Z\">3.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Cormann defends $60bn jobkeeper 'estimates variation'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The finance minister, <strong>Mathias Cormann</strong>, is before the Senate Covid-19 committee, explaining that the $60bn underspend in the jobkeeper program (from $130bn to $70bn) was an <strong>\u201cestimates</strong><strong> variation ... </strong><strong>not an accounting error as it has been falsely described by some\u201d</strong>. </p> \n  <p>Cormann explained the government was \u201cexpecting the worst\u201d and was \u201cprudently planning for the worst\u201d, but the variation was due to \u201csubstantially changed\u201d parameters \u2013 as the health outlook was much better than expected.</p> \n  <p>He said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>It is a usual estimates variation in relation to a demand driven program.</em></p> \n   <p><em>The size [of the variation] is a function of the high degree of uncertainty, and the potential size of the program.

  "<p>On 4 June 2020, as darkness enveloped Hong Kong, thousands of people broke through barricades and slipped into the tree-lined Victoria Park in the heart of the city. Shielding their candles from the wind, and carefully sitting 1 metre apart, they filled the length of the open space. The annual Tiananmen Square vigil had been banned, with police citing coronavirus concerns. But Hong Kong was determined to mark the anniversary as it always has. For three decades, the city has been the only place within China where the massacre can be publicly remembered. The commemoration is by far the world\u2019s largest, but also its most vulnerable. Its tiny flames speak to the endurance of hope and memory, and to their looming extinction.</p> <p>When the People\u2019s Liberation Army massacred hundreds of demonstrators in Beijing on 4 June 1989, the response in Hong Kong was overwhelming. One million or more residents marched in mourning. People from across society \u2013 clergymen, activists, Cantopop stars, businesspeople, foreign diplomats, even triad gangs \u2013 worked together to smuggle \u201cmost wanted\u201d student leaders off the mainland and to safety.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t just horror and sympathy that Hong Kongers were feeling in 1989; it was foreboding. The British colony was due to be handed back to China eight years later, and in the days before the killings, as rumours of an impending crackdown spread, local activists had held signs warning \u201cToday China, tomorrow Hong Kong\u201d.</p> <p>By that point, the Chinese and the British had already made the handover agreement that would come into effect in 1997. Hong Kong would be allowed to maintain its autonomy and way of life for 50 years, until 2047, under the formulation known as \u201cone country, two systems\u201d. It was a fudge, probably the best outcome achievable under the circumstances \u2013 a binding international treaty, but one that everyone knew was essentially unenforceable should China break its pledge.</p> <p>About 500,000 people left between the signing of the deal in 1984 and 1997. Prince Charles, who attended the handover ceremony, wrote after his departure: \u201cThus we left Hong Kong to her fate and the hope that Martin Lee, the leader of the Democrats, would not be arrested.\u201d</p> <p>Yet at the time of the handover, the fear in Hong Kong was matched by a certain excitement. One supporter of the current protests, Li, who is 71 and came to Hong Kong as a teenager from Guangdong, popped two bottles of champagne to celebrate: \u201cOne to say farewell to Britain, and one to welcome the People\u2019s Liberation Army to Hong Kong,\u201d he remembered. As a child, Li had witnessed the mass famine caused by the Great Leap Forward and the chaos of the Cultural Revolution, but now he felt hopeful. \u201cWe expected tomorrow to be better. We\u2019re Chinese people, not just Hong Kongers,\u201d he said.</p> <p>As the handover passed and life in Hong Kong appeared to be continuing pretty much as promised, sympathy for the mainland grew. China\u2019s years of double-digit growth brought economic rewards to the region and optimists hoped that its ongoing economic liberalisation would, over time, bring political change, too: the mainland might become more like Hong Kong. In 1997, one in five Hong Kongers identified as Chinese; 10 years later, one in three saw themselves that way.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The Tiananmen vigil has always been a barometer of anti-Beijing sentiment; the first, in 1990, attracted 150,000 people, while only 30,000 gathered in 2000. When the activist Bonnie Leung first attended as a student, a few years later, she was seen as \u201ca weirdo\u201d, she said. Every one of the friends she invited refused. But its relative unpopularity did not, to her, diminish its importance. Its very existence showed why Hong Kong was different: \u201cEven when we don\u2019t care, we always know.\u201d</p> <p>Every so often, Beijing would tighten its grip on Hong Kong, and attendance at the vigil would surge again \u2013 as in 2004, after a huge backlash killed off an attempt by the Hong Kong government to pass a national security bill that might have paved the way for peaceful critics of the Chinese Communist party to be jailed. Still, it seemed inevitable that the commemoration would gradually dwindle. Some wondered how long it would be before the vigils died away, and the memory of Tiananmen Square passed with them.</p> <p>But on 4 June 2019, 30 years after the massacre, 180,000 gathered in Victoria Park. It was the biggest turnout for years. The public had been galvanised by the threat of an extradition bill that would allow suspects to be taken to the mainland to face Communist party-controlled courts. If the bill became law, it seemed to spell the end for Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy from China. Anger had spread well beyond the usual community of activists and intellectuals. Even then, few saw what was brewing. On 9 June, when 1 million people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/09/vast-protest-in-hong-kong-against-extradition-law-china\" title=\"\">marched</a> to demand that the law be scrapped, the organisers \u2013 who included Leung, now in her 30s \u2013 were as astonished as anyone. A few days after that, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/16/hong-kong-protests-carrie-lam-china\" title=\"\">another march</a> drew 2 million people: more than one in four of the population.</p> <p>In the months that followed, even as the movement grew more radical, support continued to rise. By this spring, 58% of residents backed the protesters. A city once seen as orderly and materialistic has discovered itself to be idealistic and angry. In the past year, police have arrested more than 8,000 protesters, including children as young as 11 and pensioners as old as 83. Demonstrators and police have fought pitched battles outside shopping malls, government offices, police stations and the international airport. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3ca13c77dd931f1b43f27ac259df2e7972cb76f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ca13c77dd931f1b43f27ac259df2e7972cb76f9/0_0_5643_3762/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman shouts at police officers as they advance towards protesters in Hong Kong in July 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman shouts at police officers as they advance towards protesters in Hong Kong in July 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have any choice but to fight. We have to try to do something,\u201d said 25-year-old Kelvin Chan, sitting alone near the waterfront of Victoria Harbour as dusk fell. It was a Sunday in early August, nine weeks into the protests. Chan, in a loose black T-shirt and a facemask that barely covered his face, did not look ready to fight, but said he was \u201cwaiting for the battle\u201d that would inevitably take place once the police arrived. Protesters nearby made a barricade outside the Intercontinental Hotel as curious guests watched from the stairs. Like many of his generation, Chan believed that soon he would no longer have the chance to attend protests like these. \u201cIn the future, 2047 or earlier, I think China will brainwash Hong Kong people. China wants to control Hong Kong,\u201d he said.</p> <p>That future is arriving more abruptly than anyone anticipated. Late on 21 May, China\u2019s national legislature announced plans to impose an anti-sedition law on Hong Kong, going even further than the bill shelved by the Hong Kong government 17 years ago and the subsequent extradition law. \u201cHong Kong as we know it is finally dead,\u201d said Claudia Mo, an opposition lawmaker and longtime pro-democracy campaigner. \u201cThis is the start of a new but sad chapter for Hong Kong.\u201d The new legislation will give the government the power to silence critics and dissidents through vague charges of subversion, and to install Chinese national security agencies in the city. The nature of the move is as alarming as its content: it sets a precedent of Beijing forcing unpopular legislation on Hong Kong, which under the terms of the handover was promised \u201ca high degree of autonomy\u201d. </p> <p>Days later, police announced that they were banning the Tiananmen vigil, citing Covid-19 measures. By then, the idea of a candlelit commemoration seemed to belong to another Hong Kong: to the restrained, almost genteel activism that endured for so long. But Tiananmen\u2019s legacy persists, even among young protesters who have grown dismissive of the vigil over the years. When unrest reached its height last autumn, with molotov cocktails arcing over roads and tear gas grenades bouncing off the tarmac, graffiti appeared on a wall in the centre: \u201cIs it our 4 June 1989 now?\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Understanding the protests shaking Hong Kong requires delving back far beyond 1989. Hong Kong as we know it began to take shape in the years after the second world war. In just a decade, the population quadrupled to about 2.5 million, as former residents who had escaped the brutal wartime Japanese occupation returned, and mainland Chinese fled across the border to escape the civil war between the nationalists and communists, and after 1949, the beginning of Communist party rule.</p> <p>This was an exhausted, impoverished, crowded, hungry city. But it was also dynamic. Its inhabitants had experienced how bad things could get, and were intent on establishing a life for themselves. The new arrivals provided much of the cheap labour that powered the city\u2019s postwar manufacturing boom in the 50s and 60s, with the textile sector soon supplemented by clothing, plastic and electronics factories. This success, along with the city\u2019s heritage of trade and of the rule of law, and from 1978 onwards China\u2019s own economic liberalisation, would later make it a global financial centre.</p> <p>Until the prospect of the territory\u2019s return to China loomed, during a century and a half of colonial rule, Britain showed little interest in giving Hong Kong\u2019s citizens the power to elect their leaders. But to serve British interests, the administrators had introduced powerful institutions such as an independent judiciary. Thus Hong Kong had what the last governor, Chris Patten, described as \u201cliberty without democracy\u201d, enjoying free speech, free media and the right to protest, without the right to choose who ran the place.</p> <p>Under this system, protests became a crucial way to challenge British authorities, and later Beijing. In the 60s, major demonstrations, which developed into deadly riots in 1967, were brutally put down by police. But these events also pushed the colonial administration into tackling the needs of the local population: housing, labour rights, education. Aware of Hong Kong\u2019s anachronistic status in a post-colonial world, the British became highly conscious of the need to respond to public demands. Partly in response, protests tended to be targeted in their aims and cautious in means. After the handover, demonstrations would force authorities to abandon plans for a national security law in 2003, and the imposition of \u201cmoral and national education\u201d classes <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/30/world/asia/thousands-protest-chinas-curriculum-plans-for-hong-kong-schools.html\" title=\"\">in 2012</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bff9529d92a789c69c526c26d2ada27c54a6e646\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bff9529d92a789c69c526c26d2ada27c54a6e646/0_0_2000_1270/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A 2003 march to protest the Hong Kong government\u2019s anti-subversion bill.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"635\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A 2003 march to protest the Hong Kong government\u2019s anti-subversion bill.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vincent Yu/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the most part, though, political activity remained a fairly marginal business, and the democratic movement was law-abiding, even sedate. It wasn\u2019t until the excitment of the 2008 Beijing Olympics faded that the mood clearly began to shift. Many protesters remember that year as a turning point in their views on the mainland. Many were shocked by the steady stream of reports on corruption and other abuses in China. They included the embezzling of donations sent by Hong Kongers to victims of the Sichuan earthquake and the Sanlu infant formula <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/24/china-executes-milk-scandal-pair\" title=\"\">scandal</a>, when officials suppressed warnings about tainted milk and 300,000 children fell ill as a result.</p> <p>Over the next few years, Hong Kongers were outraged by the moral and national education controversy, and protested against the extension of the mainland\u2019s high-speed train line, fearing it was another sign of how the mainland wanted to swallow up Hong Kong. They were also alarmed by Beijing\u2019s increasing authoritarianism and repression \u2013 particularly after Xi Jinping took power in 2012 \u2013 and the mainland\u2019s growing impact on the city. It began to become evident that the mainland\u2019s economic boom was not making it more like Hong Kong, as some had once thought inevitable. It was making Hong Kong more like the mainland.</p> <p>Alongside the political anxieties came economic frustrations. Hong Kong is one of the most unequal developed economies in the world. In a city full of designer stores and flashy restaurants, it is impossible to ignore the gap between the rich and the poor. A handful of ultra-rich families prosper while the very poorest dwell in tiny \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/29/hong-kong-coffin-homes-horror-my-week\" title=\"\">coffin homes</a>\u201d, less than 2 square metres in size. Even middle-class young people see no hope of moving out of cramped family apartments. Since 1997, about 1 million new residents have arrived from the mainland, without a corresponding increase in public spending, adding to the pressure on services and contributing to soaring property prices.</p> <p>Over the past decade, Max Chung, an activist from a residential area near the border with China, has seen his neighbourhood transformed by visitors from the mainland who come to Hong Kong on weekend shopping trips. \u201cYou can\u2019t even get a table at a restaurant,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to take back our normal lives. We don\u2019t want the Chinese suitcases to roll over our feet. We want to have normal food, not the expensive ones. We really want to take back what we used to have.\u201d</p> <p>There is undoubted snobbery, and at times outright bigotry, in the way that many in Hong Kong talk about mainlanders \u2013 casting them as uncouth, uncultured \u201clocusts\u201d straining services and taking over the town. But Hong Kong has also chafed at what it sees as the arrogance of the mainland: the belief that Mandarin should take precedence over Cantonese, and that Hong Kong should simply adapt to the expectations of new arrivals. \u201cThey think: I give you money, so I am the boss. So they can be rude. They can do anything they want,\u201d said Jay, a 21-year-old student \u2013 like many activists, he preferred not to give his name.</p> <p>The hollowness of liberty without democracy has become clear to all. Hong Kong\u2019s 3.8 million voters can choose district councillors to handle matters such as bus routes. But the city\u2019s chief executive is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/22/hong-kong-chief-executive-election-what-you-need-to-know\" title=\"\">elected by</a> a committee of only 1,200, composed of representatives from business and other groups, as well as elected legislators. The system ensures that the successful candidate is Beijing\u2019s candidate. It has also traditionally given the wealthy a big say in choosing the leader, in a society where a tiny number of tycoon families already have disproportionate power, owning everything from supermarket chains and insurance firms to utility companies and housing.</p> <p>Beijing has now begun to accuse the same oligarchs it once relied upon of being greedy. It sees the protests, at root, as an economic problem, seized upon by \u201ctroublemakers\u201d and hostile foreign powers. But the tradeoff that the party has offered on the mainland \u2013 material security in place of political freedoms \u2013 does not attract Hong Kongers. People don\u2019t believe they\u2019re getting a decent economic deal, and they see political space as a right, not an optional extra. The grievances about their standard of living have morphed into deeply political sentiment.</p> <p>Over time, as discontent grew, so did the number of protests. In 2004, there were 1,975 protests in Hong Kong; by 2015 that had risen to 6,029. Tactics began to diversify. Attendance at the Tiananmen vigils began to rise. The friends who once snubbed Bonnie Leung now called her and asked if they could go together.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Despite the mounting frustrations of Hong Kongers, by early 2019, the pro-democracy movement looked to many as though it was in terminal decline. The last major protests, which took place in 2014, had ended <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/01/hong-kong-protests-produce-no-real-winners\" title=\"\">in failure</a>, and since then the erosion of Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms had accelerated. On 31 March 2019, the usual stalwarts \u2013 Martin Lee, pro-democracy politicians and Joshua Wong, the teenage face of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/30/-sp-hong-kong-umbrella-revolution-pro-democracy-protests\" title=\"\">2014 umbrella movement</a> \u2013 demonstrated against the extradition bill. The implications of the bill seemed obvious: if Hong Kong\u2019s residents could easily be extradited to face the party-controlled mainland legal system, did \u201ctwo systems\u201d really exist any more? It looked like a death blow to Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy. Yet recent history had showed the severe costs of challenging Beijing. The crowd totalled just 12,000.</p> <p>To understand the movement that has taken shape over the past year, you need to understand its relationship with its predecessor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2014/dec/11/hong-kong-protests-timeline-in-pictures\" title=\"\">the umbrella movement</a>. Those protests also centred on a demand for real universal suffrage, electrified the city and grabbed international attention. But they did not achieve their goals, and today many scorn the earlier movement as timid and unserious. \u201cAfter umbrella, I felt totally disappointed in Hong Kong people,\u201d said Jay, the student. \u201cI was there on 28 September 2014. I was shot by teargas and pepper spray. The next day people were singing songs like it was a carnival. So I think they\u2019re hopeless.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"29004360d4d64179f875529e18a7c88a42cc44ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29004360d4d64179f875529e18a7c88a42cc44ec/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A poster in Hong Kong after the end of the umbrella movement protests in 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A poster in Hong Kong after the end of the umbrella movement protests in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bobby Yip/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From 2014 onwards, Beijing did everything it could to crush the possibility of another umbrella movement. Members of the Democratic Legislative council were disqualified from the parliament. Independent bookshops disappeared, while five <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/oct/31/a-chapter-closes-last-hong-kong-bookshop-selling-titles-banned-in-china-shuts\" title=\"\">booksellers</a> dealing in salacious titles about China\u2019s leaders were kidnapped and transported to the mainland. Hong Kong University rejected the highly regarded human-rights scholar Johannes Chan for a senior position after pro-Beijing newspapers waged a campaign against him, increasing concerns about pressure on academia. The umbrella movement leaders were jailed; the best-known, Wong, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/14/joshua-wong-the-student-who-risked-the-wrath-of-beijing-its-about-turning-the-impossible-into-the-possible\" title=\"\">warned that</a> Beijing\u2019s encroachment had already diminished one country, two systems to \u201cone country, one-and-a-half\u201d.</p> <p>The defeat of the umbrella movement had looked to most like an end, not a beginning. In retrospect, it was the moment when many Hong Kongers started to believe that polite protest wouldn\u2019t work. For people like Jay, the umbrella movement has been a useful example of what not to do. Those protests demanded universal suffrage; this time round, they are primarily a stand against the erosion of rights. Those had charismatic leaders; these are leaderless and decentralised. Those were led by academics and students; these span classes, with construction workers and finance professionals joining forces. Those were committed to polite civil disobedience; these are more radical, and at times violent. Above all, the umbrella movement fractured quickly, while this time \u2013 despite all the government\u2019s efforts to split the movement \u2013 people have stayed unified.</p> <p>Yet when the mass protests began in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2019/jun/10/hong-kong-protests-in-pictures\" title=\"\">June </a>2019, they were peaceful. In mid-June, after police fired tear gas on protesters outside the seat of the government, the Legislative Complex, protesters formed what is known as the \u201cfive demands\u201d, which included the withdrawal of the bill and an independent inquiry into police brutality. On 15 June, Carrie Lam, the city\u2019s chief executive, announced she was suspending the legislation. But as many as 2 million people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2019/jun/16/hong-kong-streets-flooded-by-extradition-bill-protesters-in-pictures\" title=\"\">took to the streets</a> the following day.</p> <p>Though he is known as Hong Kong\u2019s father of democracy, Martin Lee was initially reluctant to join the demonstration. He thought it was time to negotiate: \u201cI would have liked the movement to stop,\u201d he admitted when we met last autumn at his wood-panelled chambers in central Hong Kong, where a bust of Winston Churchill stood on a shelf. In the end, he concluded he should march because the bill had been postponed rather than scrapped and might yet be revived. Lee embodies the city\u2019s tradition of courageous but pragmatic, cautious activism. But he, like so many in the city, found himself swept along by the tide.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2f6ac6da56ada6329aca6e9c2ef38707ef825341\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f6ac6da56ada6329aca6e9c2ef38707ef825341/0_186_2784_1670/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martin Lee in his Hong Kong chambers in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martin Lee in his Hong Kong chambers in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Helen Davidson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Others in the movement began to adopt more radical tactics, storming the legislative council on 1 July. Harsher police crackdowns spurred further protests as demonstrators escalated in response. Authorities refused permission for rallies and police violence intensified. Officers arrested bystanders for heckling them, drove vehicles directly at protesters and fired at journalists, in one case leaving a woman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/16/an-eye-for-an-eye-hong-kong-protests-get-figurehead-in-woman-injured-by-police\" title=\"\">blind in one eye</a>. Thugs were unleashed upon protesters and prominent activists, leaving them bloodied and beaten. In August, protesters paralysed the airport, forcing thousands of flights to be cancelled as police began to use live rounds. On 1 October, China\u2019s national day, a police officer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/01/hong-kong-protester-shot-with-live-round-during-china-national-day-rally\" title=\"\">shot</a> a 21-year-old student in the chest, while across town, a middle-aged man arguing with protesters was set on fire. The government invoked the emergency regulations ordinance, awarding itself draconian powers. In November, universities were turned into fortified camps for protesters, leading to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/20/we-couldnt-hesitate-escaping-hong-kongs-university-siege\" title=\"\">12-day siege</a>. Hundreds have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/31/fresh-unrest-in-hong-kong-after-44-protesters-charged-with-rioting\" title=\"\">charged</a> with the vaguely defined offence of rioting, which can carry a 10-year prison sentence, and more than 1,000 children have been arrested.</p> <p>If the protests were initially motivated by fear about Hong Kong\u2019s future, as they continued, a new sense of identity and community formed. It was evident in the flashmob performances of the new \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/12/glory-to-hong-kong-pro-democracy-anthem-embraced-by-protesters\" title=\"\">anthem</a>\u201d, Glory to Hong Kong, held in the shopping malls that once seemed to epitomise the city\u2019s individualism and devotion to consumption. It was evident, too, in the networks that formed to provide mutual aid, from feeding activists to treating the injuries of protesters who were too afraid of arrest to go to hospital. (These networks would find new purpose when the coronavirus reached Hong Kong. While the government dithered, the people took action: tracking cases and warning of apparent hot spots; distributing masks to the poor and elderly.) </p> <p>The sheer inventiveness of protesters helped to maintain a movement that most expected to fizzle out within weeks. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/27/hong-kong-way-peaceful-protest\" title=\"\">Hong Kong Way</a>, a 30-mile human chain that stretched across the city in late August, revived the spirits of supporters. Other actions had a concrete effect. The landslide for pro-democracy candidates in November\u2019s local elections didn\u2019t just send a message to Beijing. District councillors are among the few allowed to vote for the chief executive \u2013 potentially giving pro-democrats a greater say in who replaces Lam. It was followed by a surge in the formation of pro-democracy trade unions. </p> <p>For Helen, a protester in her late 20s, the past year has redefined how she sees Hong Kong. \u201cWe valued economics over a lot of things before,\u201d she said. \u201cThis time around, you see that people care for freedom and rights over economics. We found out how much we loved this place.\u201d </p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>While most protesters remained peaceful, a significant number started to adopt more extreme tactics, attacking Chinese state-owned businesses and companies seen to sympathise with the government. In a few cases, they assaulted locals sympathetic to Beijing. One man was killed by a stone thrown, seemingly by a protester, in a clash.</p> <p>Along the route of a march in September, someone had scrawled under a bus stop: \u201cToday Xinjiang, tomorrow Hong Kong.\u201d To outsiders, it might have seemed incredible to compare this still largely rural region of western China, which is kept under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/aug/07/why-uighur-muslims-across-china-are-living-in-fear\" title=\"\">extraordinarily repressive</a> security, to this cosmopolitan global financial centre, still by far the freest part of China. Protesters saw Xinjiang as a warning: if they did not take a stand now, they would never be able to do so. People were fighting not to win, but because they knew what losing meant.</p> <p>Many young protesters speak of a willingness to die for the cause, writing wills and last messages for their families to find. \u201cThere is some part of me that has changed,\u201d says Niko Cheng, 22, a nursing student who volunteers as a medic. For months she has been prepared to be arrested, sacrificing her future. And at the height of the protests in the summer, she was ready to die if that would help to expose the brutality of the police. \u201cIf you have been to the frontline once, you feel that everyone surrounding you loves Hong Kong so much, and they are willing to do everything for it,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of them have already given up their future to be here. After that, you can\u2019t go back to being a normal person again. You can\u2019t just watch,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5b7aeee85871e9a018a48a303bcb1c8a4cbb721d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b7aeee85871e9a018a48a303bcb1c8a4cbb721d/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cOne Nation, One Hong Kong\u201d graffiti left behind by protesters on a wall in Hong Kong - 24 May 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graffiti left after a protest in Hong Kong last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Willie Siau/SOPA Images/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though there is no doubt that protesters have been violent, there is widespread suspicion in the movement \u2013 rightly or not \u2013 that undercover officers have acted as agents provocateurs. There is also fury that no police have been held responsible for outrages. Before the protests, just 6% of the population said it had no trust in the police; now, <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2019/11/09/surveys-show-majority-of-hong-kong-people-have-lost-trust-in-the-citys-police-force/\" title=\"\">more than half</a> report zero trust. The population is traumatised and exhausted. A study by the University of Hong Kong suggested that one in three adults <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/10/hong-kong-nearly-a-third-of-adults-report-ptsd-symptoms-study\" title=\"\">had symptoms</a> of post-traumatic stress disorder, comparable to rates in conflict zones. (This may underestimate the extent of the problem, since only those over 18 were surveyed, while many protesters are younger.) </p> <p>As support for the movement has intensified, so has opposition to it. A large chunk of the population, not only recent arrivals from the mainland, is equally passionate in rejecting the movement. Friends have fallen out. Parents have kicked out activist children. Helen, the protester whose view of Hong Kong has been transformed by the protests, hadn\u2019t spoken to her father for months, even though they live in the same small flat. He couldn\u2019t understand how irresponsible she was being. She couldn\u2019t understand how a man who had swum across the sea to escape Mao\u2019s China had become so loyal to Beijing.</p> <p>The rallying cry for Helen\u2019s generation has been \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time\u201d. Now some have become supportive of the idea of full independence from the mainland, even if they believe it unrealisable. As people gathered late last month to protest Beijing\u2019s announcement of the national security law, they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/07/anger-still-there-hong-kong-defiant-one-year-anniversary-first-protests-china\" title=\"\">chanted a slogan</a> rarely heard before: \u201cHong Kong independence, the only way out!\u201d</p> <p>Activism in Hong Kong was always constrained by the understanding of how little was possible. Margaret Ng, a veteran democratic activist and former legislator, describes Hong Kong\u2019s struggle with Beijing as \u201cDavid and Goliath, without the sling\u201d. But the political space has shrunk so far that, for some, the end result is not caution but nihilism. An ideology of self-destruction known as lam chao, or \u201cIf we burn, you burn with us\u201d, has gained momentum. More radical demonstrators believe the collapse of Hong Kong is the only way to really bring change. \u201cWe are not afraid. If the Chinese army comes out, we will celebrate. The entire Hong Kong business environment will collapse. If they call the military here, it would ruin Hong Kong and also mainland China\u2019s economy,\u201d said Yan, 26.</p> <p>\u201cI have hope, but my hope is that we take China down with us,\u201d Helen said.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Beijing has abandoned any pretence of winning hearts and minds. With the prospect of pro-democracy candidates making inroads in this September\u2019s elections for the legislative council, and the international cover afforded by the coronavirus pandemic, repression by authorities has dramatically intensified. Now they are doing through fear what they failed to do through persuasion.</p> <p>In the months before the new national security law was announced, Beijing replaced its envoy in Hong Kong with an enforcer lacking experience of the region but known for his hardline tactics. The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office described protesters as a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/china-calls-hong-kong-protesters-a-political-virus\" title=\"\">political virus</a>\u201d that required elimination. In April, 15 of the region\u2019s best-known pro-democracy figures <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/police-in-hong-kong-arrest-14-activists-amid-autonomy-warnings\" title=\"\">were arrested</a> on charges of illegal assembly. They included Margaret Ng, the media tycoon Jimmy Lai, Lee Cheuk-yan, a key vigil organiser \u2013 and Martin Lee, who had until now avoided the fate that Prince Charles had feared in 1997. \u201cI\u2019m relieved and very proud to finally be listed as a defendant after seeing so many brilliant young people arrested and charged,\u201d the 81-year-old told reporters.</p> <p>Even after these ominous moves, the news of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/hong-kong-what-are-the-implications-of-china-sedition-laws-national-security-beijing\" title=\"\">national security law</a> was shattering. \u201cIf the extradition bill was a rifle aimed at our rights, the national security legislation is a machine gun,\u201d Lai wrote. Johannes Chan, the legal scholar, said: \u201cHistory tells us the law will soon apply to all kinds of political dissidents, then it will apply to media, NGOs, the lawyers and basically anyone who criticises the government.\u201d That is how the mainland\u2019s laws are used. The Nobel peace prize laureate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/13/liu-xiaobo-nobel-laureate-chinese-political-prisoner-dies-61\" title=\"\">Liu Xiaobo</a> died while serving an 11-year sentence for incitement to subvert state power. His crime was a call for democratic reforms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"016fcb4be03fa24f6bdc7d26590064dcf6b6c0d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/016fcb4be03fa24f6bdc7d26590064dcf6b6c0d2/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam in June 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam earlier this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tyrone Siu/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the announcement, downloads of VPNs soared, as did calls to immigration consultants. Some in Hong Kong always saw the movement as a last-ditch bid to stay in their home. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019m leaving,\u201d one professional said when the anti-extradition bill first drove him to the streets in anger in July. But the spur for many protesters was the knowledge that they would not be able to do so. \u201cAcross classes, people in Hong Kong have completely lost trust in the PRC. They just give up hope entirely. If they cannot leave, what can they do? Many people are asking this question,\u201d says Ming Sing, an associate professor at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.</p> <p>Authorities insist there is nothing to fear, claiming that the new law will only target \u201ca narrow set of acts\u201d, and that the vast majority of Hong Kong residents will not be affected. Yet Carrie Lam has refused to rule out the law being applied retrospectively, and her statements seem designed to induce rather than allay people\u2019s fears: \u201cWe are a very free society, so for the time being, people have the freedom to say whatever they want to say\u201d, she told reporters in May.</p> <p>Some Hong Kong residents are genuinely anxious to put the unrest behind them as the city plunges deeper into recession. But many are also under intense pressure to demonstrate support for Beijing. Victor Li, the son of the billionaire tycoon Li Ka-shing, said he hoped that the legislation would help the city\u2019s society and economy return to normal. The heads of five of the city\u2019s universities also endorsed the law, along with hundreds of celebrities and artists. State media claim that 2.93 million residents have signed a petition backing the law, though protesters believe this figure is wildly implausible.</p> <p>With the law yet to be drafted, Hong Kong\u2019s protesters hope international pressure could still have some impact on its final form, and how it is implemented and enforced. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure even Beijing would have not preferred to exercise this nuclear option \u2026 we made Beijing pay the full price,\u201d the researcher and activist Lokman Tsui wrote in a Facebook post the morning after the announcement. \u201cTaiwan is watching. The United States is watching. Beijing is on notice, in front of the entire world. We have hope because we act. We take the hit, we get up and we live to fight another day.\u201d</p> <p>Beijing appears unfazed by US threats or international criticism. Even as the Chinese economy struggles to recover amid the pandemic, it no longer \u201cneeds\u201d Hong Kong as it once did. In 1997, Hong Kong\u2019s economy was equivalent to 20% of the mainland economy; now it is about 3%. Either Beijing has gambled that Trump won\u2019t follow through on threats to remove the region\u2019s special trade status, or \u2013 more likely \u2013 it has concluded that asserting its own power takes precedence. It, too, can take the hit.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>Though the fear in Hong Kong is palpable, resistance has not yet disappeared. This year has seen a marked shift to what political scientist Edmund Cheng calls \u201ceveryday resistance\u201d, such as trade unionisation and the \u201cyellow-ribbon economy\u201d, supporting only local businesses that back the protests. This is what opposition might look like in the long-term.</p> <p>The Tiananmen commemoration, too, is evolving. Despite the ban, thousands of Hong Kong residents descended on Victoria Park. Others held vigils throughout each of the city\u2019s districts. \u201cYou can seal the park but you can\u2019t seal people\u2019s hearts,\u201d said Han Dongfang, a labour rights activist who led protests in Beijing in 1989.</p> <p>For many, this year\u2019s commemoration was no longer just about those who died in Beijing, but Hong Kong\u2019s struggle. The usual slogans calling for the CPC to reckon with the massacre were drowned out by chants of the protest movement, as well newer slogans calling for independence: \u201cOne-nation Hong Kong\u201d. The crowd included the older generation and young activists, who now see the events of 1989 as a warning.</p> <p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t do something now, maybe someday Hong Kong will become like June 4,\u201d said Zack Ho, 18, who attended a vigil near his home before rushing to join the main one in Victoria Park. \u201cWe saw how the tanks rode over students. That\u2019s the real picture of how evil the Chinese regime is. We have to remind Hong Kongers that maybe that\u2019s the future of Hong Kong.\u201d</p> <p>The massacre, and the vigils to commemorate it, planted the seeds for today\u2019s Hong Kong: the understanding of what is at stake, and the sacrifices that may be required to defend it. The CPC drew its own lessons from the events of that year \u2013 not just Tiananmen, but the collapse of the Soviet Union. It learned to avoid a bloody crackdown if you can help it \u2013 the costs are too high \u2013 but also to avoid concessions, and to hold on to political power at all costs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/08/chinas-memory-manipulators\">China\u2019s memory manipulators</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Will Hong Kong ever see another mass commemoration of 1989? \u201cI think it will be one of the things that they really want to get rid of,\u201d said Leung. \u201cIt is totally peaceful. We hold candles. We do nothing but mourn, and be the guardians of the truth. But the idea is so threatening to the Communist party.\u201d</p> <p>It echoed her earlier remark that Hong Kongers knew, even when they didn\u2019t care: not just about 1989, but about all the events that had followed in its wake \u2013 as mainlanders could not. The vigil stood not only for the city\u2019s freedoms of assembly and expression, but also of information. That knowledge gave them the choice to exercise their rights or not, and to imagine another future, however impossible it might be to realise. No one can doubt, now, that Hong Kong people care.

Yet for many, her comments rang equally hollow. In April, Ranaut came out in support of her sister after she wrote a social media post said to have stirred up anti-Muslim hatred by declaring \u201cMullahs [Muslim religious leaders] + secular media stand them in a line and shoot them dead \u2026 they may call us Nazis who cares\u201d.</p> <p>Ranaut\u2019s sister\u2019s post had repeated rumours, later proved to be false, that members of a Muslim congregation had attacked doctors and officials trying to take them into coronavirus quarantine and led to her account being suspended.

So of course it\u2019s easier to talk about Black Lives matter, because it\u2019s safer. There\u2019s nothing at stake.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, in India Bollywood films need certification from a government-controlled body in order to be released, and so films, and therefore actors, are very vulnerable to government intervention.</p> <p>For Bhasker, she said she had paid a \u201cvery, very heavy price\u201d for speaking out against injustices in India. \u201cI\u2019ve lost work, I\u2019ve lost brands, I\u2019ve gained this reputation for being \u2018controversial\u2019 which is just bizarre,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery single day, my family and friends ask \u2018why do you do this to yourself?\u2019\u201d</p>",

She compared it to past calls to abolish US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) ahead of the 2018 congressional midterms, which resulted in Democrats regaining control of the House.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable to hear this coming from today\u2019s Democrat party,\u201d she continued, declining to say whether the president supported any specific policing reforms.&nbsp;</p> <p>The effort to turn the national debate over racism and policing so that it works against Democrats comes as Trump continues to fall behind Biden in key battleground states, according to several recent polls, amid his incendiary response to the mass protests against police brutality and his widely criticized handling of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a> pandemic.&nbsp;</p> <p>Though Democrats have vowed to curb the powers of the police, few support&nbsp;defunding police departments.<strong> </strong>On Monday, Biden distanced himself from the slogan while embracing the growing activism around reforms in policing and criminal justice.&nbsp;</p> <p>Biden \u201chears and shares the deep grief and frustration of those calling out for change\u201d and \u201csupports the urgent need for reform\u201d, a campaign spokesman, Andrew Bates, said in a statement on Monday. But he stated bluntly that Biden \u201cdoes not believe that police should be defunded\u201d.</p> <p>Bates said the former vice president, who on Monday met privately with the family of George Floyd in Houston, believes that coupling additional funding for \u201cpublic schools, summer programs, and mental health and substance abuse treatment\u201d with support for police departments would lead to improved outcomes.</p> <p>In stark contrast, Trump has implored law enforcement to \u201cdominate\u201d the streets where Americans were marching en masse against police brutality and racism.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cLAW &amp; ORDER, NOT DEFUND AND ABOLISH THE POLICE,\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1269970808329437185\">tweeted</a> on Monday. \u201cThe Radical Left Democrats have gone Crazy!\u201d</p> <p>Later, at a roundtable with law enforcement officials at the White House, Trump declared: \u201cWe won\u2019t be defunding our police. There won\u2019t be dismantling of our police. There\u2019s not going to be any disbanding of our police.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>He conceded that the nation had witnessed \u201csome horrible things\u201d at the hands of police officers but insisted that virtually all \u2013&nbsp;\u201clet\u2019s go with 99%\u201d \u2013 of them&nbsp;are \u201cgreat, great people.\u201d</p> <p>Republicans sense an opportunity to portray Democrats as extremists eager to disband police departments, while driving a wedge between energized protesters and elected officials advocating for more incremental change.</p> <p>Yet many supporters of the campaign to defund the police say it isn\u2019t necessarily about dismantling police departments or stripping them entirely of funding. Rather they say it is an effort to address systemic problems in policing by radically re-prioritizing community budgets to divert funding from law enforcement to programs related to mental health, poverty and education.&nbsp;</p> <p>And as protests continue to swell in cities across the country, their political influence was apparent. On Sunday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/08/minneapolis-city-council-police-department-dismantle\">a veto-proof majority of the Minneapolis City Council</a> pledged to dismantle the city\u2019s police department, promising to replace it with a new community-based system of public safety. Meanwhile, several major cities, including Los Angeles and New York, are already considering changes to their policing budgets while others are considering policy changes.&nbsp;</p> <p>Democrats on Monday forged ahead with a far-reaching plan to overhaul policing in America, called the Justice in Policing Act of 2020. The plan would make it easier to prosecute police misconduct when officers violate a citizen\u2019s civil rights, limit the transfer of military weaponry to state and local departments and put pressure on the justice department to address racial profiling and systemic racial bias in policing.</p> <p>Though the legislation has galvanized Democrats, it remains unclear if congressional Republicans will join the effort, particularly in the Senate.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re already seeing outlandish calls, defund the police. Abolish the police,\u201d McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor Monday that did not address the Democrats\u2019 proposal. \u201cI think you may want a police officer to arrest a criminal before you try to work through his feelings.\u201d</p>"
