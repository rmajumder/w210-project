It meant the average number of unemployed per job vacancy across Australia dropped from 3.1 to 3 persons.</p> <p>It\u2019s ludicrous, of course.</p> <p>Now the numbers are nowhere near that.</p> <p>Just how bad they are is tough to estimate. Callam Pickering, economist at global job site Indeed, estimates that currently job adverts are running about 33% below what they were last year.</p> <p>It would actually be surprising if they don\u2019t drop by more \u2013 during the 1990s recession they fell by half.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/02/morrison-insists-nothing-lasts-forever-especially-the-coronavirus-spending-spree\">Morrison reminds us nothing lasts forever \u2013 especially the coronavirus spending spree | Malcolm Farr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the same time, <a href=\"https://www.westpac.com.au/docs/pdf/aw/economics-research/WestpacWeekly.pdf\">Westpac estimates</a> that by June the unemployment rate will more than double to 11.1% .</p> <p>Given the wage subsidies announced this week, which attempt to keep workers notionally employed, that figure might turn out to be overly pessimistic. But given as well the large numbers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/australian-government-warned-not-to-drag-its-feet-on-help-for-casual-workers-in-coronavirus-crisis\">casual workers who will miss out</a>, being pessimistic is probably the right way to go.</p> <p>If we assume unemployment doubles, and the number of vacancies halve, the number of unemployed per vacancy would rise in three months from three persons to 12. In some states such as South Australia it would shoot up to 19 unemployed per vacancy.</p> <p>This would not actually be a record. During the 1990s recession, at one point across Australia there were 28 unemployed per vacancy and both Victoria and South Australia at various times had levels of 48 unemployed per vacancy.</p> <p>But it certainly is a record increase \u2013 the speed with which coronavirus has changed the economy is beyond anything that has ever been experienced before.</p> <p>And with it have come changes in what was previously considered impossible.</p> <p>Doubling Newstart? Free childcare? A wage subsidy that is very close to a universal basic income? All previously dismissed as unaffordable or even \u201ccommunist\u201d are now government policy.</p> <p>The temptation is to think this will mark a change in how things will be.</p> <p>And sure, it would be nice if conservatives suddenly faced the reality that their \u201csmall government\u201d narrative of the past 40 years has been reduced to ashes.</p> <p>But even within the prime minister\u2019s words we see that the policies, while sensible and essential, are not a signal of changed outlook.</p> <p>The focus remains very much on businesses rather than workers, and Morrison\u2019s own words betray that the underlying view point remains.</p> <p>This week when announcing the childcare payments, <a href=\"https://www.pm.gov.au/media/press-conference-australian-parliament-house-act-020420\">he told reporters</a>, \u201cin this new normal that we\u2019re living in, it\u2019s no longer about entitlement. It\u2019s about need.\u201d</p> <p>So subsidised childcare is only <em>now</em> about need? Wow.</p> <p>He continued: \u201cWe\u2019re calling on all Australians to think about what they need, and to think about the needs of their fellow Australians who may have a greater need when it comes to calling on the many things that are being provided.\u201d</p> <p>The lack of introspection about how there have always been many \u201cfellow Australians who may have a greater need\u201d is rather stunning.</p> <p>Don\u2019t be fooled into thinking we now have a socialist government.

It hadn\u2019t actually been done.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re all still in the hotel rooms. And it\u2019s worse than prison. They have cramped rooms with windows that don\u2019t open, no balcony and are not allowed to leave even for some fresh air and exercise. Some hotels aren\u2019t cleaning the rooms for the two weeks and aren\u2019t offering people products to clean their own bathrooms.\u201d</p> <p>Finlay said one person had been told they could have a food package delivered by a family member. The family member included a bottle of wine, which the hotel confiscated. He described those in the hotels as \u201cdetainees\u201d and said many did not have access to a laundry. One hotel, the Hilton, was charging some $20 to do the washing, he said. This is not covered by the government.</p> <p>One of the vulnerable passengers Finlay flagged for medical exemption from staying in a hotel was a man who had survived being in a fifth floor hotel room in Kathmandu during the deadly Nepal earthquakes in 2015. He\u2019d been trapped for some time with dead bodies nearby.</p> <p>\u201cUnderstandably he didn\u2019t want to end up in a hotel with windows that didn\u2019t open, no balcony and no scope for getting out of the room to exercise and feel normal,\u201d Finlay said. \u201cHe held grave fears for his mental health and I agreed. I escalated his case a few times to the ministry of health with no communication back to me and no action taken.\u201d</p> <p>Another vulnerable woman found out she was approximately 15 weeks pregnant. Due to being on a remote island prior to returning to Australia, she has so far had no antenatal screening and this is her first pregnancy. She had arranged to be seen by an obstetrician in her home city of Hobart but was unable to travel to Tasmania due to strict travel restrictions which meant that, even after completing two weeks isolation in NSW, she and her husband would be required to do the same again in Tasmania.</p> <p>\u201cShe works in an emergency service,\u201d Finlay said. \u201cShe was very anxious about not having any antenatal screening until the end of another four weeks. She reported to me that she spoke to the onsite doctor and that she is not allowed out of her room so she could get antenatal screening.\u201d</p> <p>Finlay also shared concerns for other quarantined arrivals, including a woman with a newborn baby who he said is a high risk for developing post natal depression, and an older couple where the husband has dementia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/coronavirus-covid-19-australian-doctors-dentists-stuck-cruise-ship-coast-chile\">Coronavirus ban: more than 100 Australian doctors and dentists stuck on cruise ship off Chile</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThey were to be isolated in a hotel despite having a home in Sydney,\u201d Finlay said. \u201cThe unfamiliar environment and confinement is likely to result in behavioural disturbances for her husband.\u201d</p> <p>He said a paraplegic woman with a catheter and needing an air mattress so that she doesn\u2019t get pressure sores, and who has a carer who helps her with tasks such as bathing, was not allowed to be driven to Wollongong to her house that her friends had ensured was stocked with supplies for her return.</p> <p>\u201cTo my knowledge she is still languishing in a hotel in Sydney,\u201d Finlay said. \u201cI can\u2019t in good conscience sit and wait for the authorities to rectify any of this because there\u2019s evidence that they know and still won\u2019t do anything. I\u2019d prefer to be in prison than turn a blind eye after days of trying through official channels to have all of this addressed.\u201d</p> <p>A remote and regional tropical emergency doctor, Amy Neilson, who was among the doctors placed into quarantine after returning from Peru, agreed with Finlay\u2019s assessment of the situation in hotels. Communications have been changing regularly particularly between police and the hotel, with lack of clarity given to those in isolation, she said, adding there was uncertainty on the date and time people will be allowed to return home. Neilson said people would cope better if they were given clear information.<br><br>\u201cSome people really are struggling and lonely, particularly older people,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very disorientating for them.\u201d<br><br>She added that \u201cpolice are running\u201d the hotel operations. \u201cThe communications between border force, police, the hotel and the army appear to be a mess,\u201d Neilson said.</p> <p>NSW police and the Hilton have been contacted for comment. In a statement, NSW Health confirmed The Public Health Order has provisions for exemptions. The department did not respond to questions around how many of these exemptions had been granted. The statement said the minister of health has delegated the authority to grant exemptions to a panel of experienced doctors.</p> <p>\u201cEach exemption request is individually considered, and a significant number of exemptions have already been granted,\u201d the statement said.</p> <p>\u201cEach hotel has on site nursing and a daily medical presence. Travellers can access this medical service. Requests for exemptions are also escalated by this avenue. Applications for an exemption on medical or compassionate grounds can also be made by travellers to the Australian department of health, which sends these onto NSW Health.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Do you know more? melissa.davey@theguardian.com</strong></p>",
  "<p>With all the serious issues surrounding coronavirus, it feels surreal and distasteful to be encouraged to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/03/matt-hancock-deflecting-blame-on-to-footballers-andros-townsend-crystal-palace-premier-league-pay-cuts\">focus our ire</a> on the stereotype of, so it goes, greedy, selfish, over-paid footballers.</p> <p>Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said: \u201cGiven the sacrifices that many people are making, including some of my colleagues in the NHS who have made the ultimate sacrifice... I think the first thing that Premier League footballers can do is make a contribution, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/52142267\">take a pay cut</a> and play their part.\u201d Shame on you, Mr Hancock: coronavirus should not be used as an excuse for a crass, inappropriate stand-off between footballers and tragically dead NHS workers.</p> <p>That\u2019s not to say that top-flight football has been above criticism during the pandemic. Clubs such as Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United have been rightly censured for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/02/pay-cuts-furlough-or-deferrals-what-are-the-premier-league-clubs-doing\">taking advantage</a> of the government\u2019s furloughing scheme, allowing taxpayers to pick up the bill for cleaners, security, shop workers and catering staff, leading to accusations of a \u201cmoral vacuum\u201d.</p> <p>The Premier League has now asked players, via the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association, to take <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/03/premier-league-clubs-will-ask-players-to-take-30-per-cent-wage-drop-cuts-deferrals\">a 30% drop in pay</a>, in terms of cuts and wage referrals, while the 20 top clubs will <a href=\"https://www.sportinglife.com/football/news/pl-in-pound125m-advance-for-efl-clubs/178891?aff=1197317997&amp;dcmp=SL_TWITTER_PREMIERLEAGUE\">donate \u00a3125m</a> to the English Football League and National League and \u00a320m to support the NHS, communities and vulnerable groups.</p> <p>I sincerely hope that even more good is done and more selflessness displayed. However, it was still unfair to frame this as footballers needing to be morally shamed into action because players don\u2019t control how wages are paid. Such framing pitted \u201cordinary\u201d people against not just football \u2013 in terms of big business \u2013 but individual players.</p> <p>And, you think: why are footballers \u2013 young, self-made sportsmen - in particular getting stick and not, say, far <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8183763/Sell-one-yachts-Outrage-billionaire-Sir-Philip-Green-asks-taxpayer-help.html\">wealthier global businessman</a>, several of whom have held their hands out for government assistance?</p> <p>To me, this reeks of deep-rooted class prejudice. Overwhelmingly, footballers tend to come from poorer backgrounds, often extremely poor in the case of overseas players. This means that, as much as the players are idolised, they also find themselves routinely attacked for being greedy, arrogant and \u201cjumped up\u201d.</p> <p>Of course Premier League players are overpaid, but people forget that, in days gone by, clubs took much of the money and footballers were lucky to end up with a pub and a drink problem when their careers were over. But an archaic resentment towards players persists and while, generally, it\u2019s lighthearted (\u201cHe\u2019s paid <em>how much</em> and he misses a penalty?\u201d), at other times, like now, it has a real danger of turning rancid.</p> <p>This is what Hancock seemed to be doing with his comment \u2013 taking an easy shot at \u201crich\u201d, \u201cspoilt\u201d footballers, perhaps to deflect attention from the government\u2019s own failings. What an insult to those brave NHS workers who made the ultimate sacrifice.</p> <h2>Modern romance was ruined long before coronavirus</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e38ecaf6816818d0a9b6c77cb66d790cbdf370c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e38ecaf6816818d0a9b6c77cb66d790cbdf370c9/0_153_4578_2747/1000..jpg\" alt=\"the tinder app logo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018For too many women, this has turned out to be the romance model that never <em>starts</em> giving.

More seriously, as tricky and awful as the situation is, don\u2019t many people find online dating difficult and unfulfilling at the best of times \u2013 if somebody wants a relationship and not just a hook-up?</p> <p>Sexual emancipation is a wonderful thing, but both parties must agree. Since the online dating boom, too often it has seemed that women in particular have been dealing with dating on uber-sexualised male terms \u2013 where sex is the main objective, and relationships have become rare and disposable.</p> <p>For too many women, this has turned out to be the romance model that never <em>starts</em> giving.

Put bluntly, it\u2019s about facilitating commitment phobia. For some, this works well and good luck to them. For others, it leads to misery and the tedium of dealing with weaponised time-wasters.</p> <p>Has online dating played fair with people who ultimately want relationships? Obviously, there are safety issues in meeting strangers. Away from that, while casual sex has its place, I sympathise with anyone who dislikes the modern romantic-sexual landscape, but gets labelled prudish if they complain. So, sure, modern romance is tricky in the time of coronavirus, but some might argue that online love is also a nightmare.</p> <h2>So Harry can\u2019t pop over to granny\u2019s.

  "<p>Three recent mobile phone mast fires around the UK are being investigated as possible arson, amid concerns that people are attacking telecoms infrastructure because of a conspiracy theory linking 5G technology to the spread of coronavirus.</p> \n<p>The mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, also revealed he had received threats relating to the \u201cbizarre\u201d theory, which has gained traction on social media.</p> \n<p>On Friday, emergency services were called to reports that a 5G mast was on fire in Liverpool shortly before 11pm. Police confirmed they were investigating the blaze at Spencer\u2019s Lane, Aintree, close to the M57 motorway.</p> \n<p>Fire crews managed to get the fire under control quickly and were photographed parked outside the field shortly after it was extinguished.</p> \n<p>The media regulator, Ofcom, said on Thursday it was monitoring broadcasters who spread the discredited conspiracy theory, although coverage has spread more widely on social networks, such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and Nextdoor.</p> \n<p>Speaking at Saturday\u2019s Downing Street press conference, cabinet secretary Michael Gove said the theories were \u201cdangerous nonsense\u201d. Professor Steve Powis, national medical director of NHS England, condemned them as \u201cthe worst kind of fake news\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m absolutely outraged, absolutely disgusted, that people would be taking action against the very infrastructure that we need to respond to this health emergency,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is absolute and utter rubbish.\u201d </p> \n<p>Just hours before the reported incident in Liverpool, Anderson dismissed the theories as \u201cbizarre\u201d. He said he was amazed by the amount of traction the conspiracy was getting on social media, and that all scientific and government advice showed the technology posed no harm to people.</p> \n<p>Speaking to the Guardian, the mayor revealed he had received threats relating to the theory and had reported them to Merseyside police.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe suggestion that Covid-19 is somehow linked to 5G is patently beyond the realms of credibility \u2013 utterly bizarre,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn Liverpool these masts are being upgraded and ironically the very people that are using this technology are the ones who are believing these theories. I was mildly threatened yesterday by someone telling me to take them down.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe reality is there is huge pressure on the network at the moment with so many people at home and that\u2019s why engineers are upgrading it. The idea that I have entered into some kind of machiavellian plot with the government is ridiculous.\u201d</p> \n<p>Social media posts from celebrities, such as the singer Anne-Marie, have helped spread the theory, while Amanda Holden, a judge on Britain\u2019s Got Talent, shared a link to an online petition promoting the false rumour that the symptoms of coronavirus are caused by residing near a 5G mast. The petition was removed following inquiries from the Guardian.</p> \n<p>Cheers actor Woody Harrelson and former Dancing on Ice judge Jason Gardiner are also among stars who have shared theories.</p> \n<p>The government is increasingly concerned about the impact of the spread of such false theories.</p> \n<p>A spokesperson for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport, which has responsibility for telecoms policy, warned people to stop damaging key infrastructure during a national emergency: \u201cThese are baseless theories, there is absolutely no credible evidence of a link between 5G and coronavirus. Threats or violence towards any key worker or damage to mobile phone masts will not be tolerated.\u201d</p> \n<p>On Thursday, police in Belfast appealed for information after a mobile phone mast was damaged in an arson attack, with online footage suggesting the motive was opposition to 5G networks.</p> \n<p>The video clip shows an incident on the Antrim Road in north Belfast on Thursday night, in which flames can be seen at the base of a mobile telephone mast.</p> \n<p>According to a report in the <a href=\"https://www.irishnews.com/coronavirus/2020/04/04/news/police-appeal-for-witnesses-to-5g-arson-attack-on-phone-mast-1890409/\">Irish News</a>, voices can be heard stating \u201cFuck the 5G\u201d and \u201cViva la revolution\u201d as the fire burns.</p> \n<p>Facebook removed one anti-5G group in which members were being encouraged to supply footage of them destroying mobile phone equipment. Video footage of a 70ft (20m) telephone mast on fire in Birmingham this week has also circulated widely alongside claims it was targeted by anti-5G protesters.</p> \n<p>The problem has become so bad that engineers working for Openreach, which provides home broadband services, have posted pleas on anti-5G Facebook groups, asking to be spared from on-street abuse as they are not involved in maintaining mobile networks.</p> \n<p>The industry lobby group Mobile UK said the incidents were affecting efforts to maintain networks that were supporting home working and providing critical connectivity to the emergency services, vulnerable consumers and hospitals. Telecoms engineers are considered key workers under the government\u2019s guidelines.</p> \n<p>International radiation experts have repeatedly made clear that the new high-speed telephone system does not pose a risk to humans, while pointing out that the coronavirus has spread widely in many countries without any 5G coverage, such as Iran.</p>",

A few short years later, Britain is plunged into deadly turmoil, one that exposes hitherto ignored injustices, while an ideologically shapeshifting Tory prime minister with surging popularity expands the state\u2019s role in the economy to an unprecedented degree. But Labour\u2019s radicalism remains undimmed; the party recognises that revolutionary times require revolutionary answers.</p> <p>The implausible Labour leader was George Lansbury in 1935; his successor was Clement Attlee; and the Tory prime minister who seemed to be the master of all before him was Winston Churchill. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/04/keir-starmer-wins-labour-leadership-election\">Keir Starmer wins a decisive victory</a> to become the 22nd leader of the Labour party in its 115-year history, a new 1945 seems, for now, a distant prospect. He assumes the leadership in unenviable circumstances. Labour was battered in December\u2019s election; the party has been traumatised by half a decade of internal strife; the Brexit culture war has polarised the nation and wreaked havoc among the party\u2019s electoral coalition; and the UK is being convulsed by its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/03/john-mcdonnell-calls-for-wealth-tax-to-pay-for-coronavirus-measures\">greatest crisis</a> since the guns fell silent three-quarters of a century ago.</p> <p>But Starmer can succeed, and anyone with progressive sympathies should actively will his leadership to do so. His democratic mandate is rooted in <a href=\"https://keirstarmer.com/plans/10-pledges/\">a policy prospectus</a> which, before 2015, would have been deemed unthinkably radical by mainstream Labour: hiking taxes on the rich and big business to fund public investment; democratic public ownership of utilities and services; expanding the welfare state; the abolition of tuition fees; a green industrial revolution; defending migrants\u2019 rights; an end to illegal wars. Starmer declared that Labour\u2019s 2017 manifesto \u2013 which punctured a suffocating generation of \u201cthere is no alternative\u201d\u2013 was the party\u2019s foundational document.</p> <p>In one of his campaign videos, Starmer rightly declared that Labour must hold Boris Johnson to account for the promises made in his election campaign. The same applies to Starmer; here are red lines that cannot be crossed, the reasons thousands of members who voted for Jeremy Corbyn in two leadership elections have placed their trust in him. What hurt Corbyn, in the end, was not being seen as dangerously extreme. It was instead that Brexit unfairly made him seem like a flip-flopper who would say anything to win power. But there is cause for optimism: Starmer\u2019s allies are emphatic that his commitments are an authentic expression of his own beliefs.</p> <p>When Corbyn became leader, many of his opponents within the Labour party embraced a scorched earth policy. They desperately wanted him to fail, craving vindication more than displacing a Tory government. They cheered every misstep and failure throwing relentless tasty morsels to insatiable vultures in the rightwing media. They actively destabilised his leadership. Some on the aggrieved left may ask why they should behave any differently. It would achieve nothing except to prolong the Tory nightmare and alienate the wider membership. Now is the time for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/21/defeat-left-labour-activism-party\">critical friendship</a>; dissent should be in the context of willing the triumph of a radical Labour government.</p> <p>There will be those who now want the left to go and find the nearest ditch to die in. So, let\u2019s be clear from the outset: we aren\u2019t going anywhere. Already, those who caricatured Corbynism as an era of authoritarian Stalinism are demanding bloodthirsty purges, to permanently smash the left once and for all. In the coming days and weeks, those elements will do all they can to provoke and demoralise the left. Don\u2019t listen to them: this is your party. Every socialist who rips up their membership card, who retreats from political activity, who finds sanctuary in a dead-end leftwing sect, will be cause for celebration for those hankering for a Blairite revival.</p> <p>The mistake many \u201ccentrist\u201d voices have made is to dismiss political phenomena they do not like \u2013 from Corbynism to Brexit to Trump \u2013 as simply being mass irrationality, stupidity and hysteria. But Corbyn secured a landslide victory in 2015 because all of the other flanks of the Labour party were politically and intellectually exhausted. Labour\u2019s social democrats had abandoned social democracy; the last consistent social democrats left standing were Labour\u2019s left flank. All of its sister parties were in crisis, including those \u2013 like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/03/the-guardian-view-on-germanys-social-democrats-turning-left-is-a-risky-but-necessary-gamble\">German Social Democrats</a> \u2013 who had stuck to the \u201cthird way\u201d playbook. Just two years after what was then one of the party\u2019s worst defeats, and in the aftermath of a vicious civil war, Labour <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/corbyn-election-results-votes-away-prime-minister-theresa-may-hung-parliament-a7782581.html\">came within 2,227 votes and seven constituencies</a> of forming a government in 2017.</p> <p>Today\u2019s two major success stories for the European left are the Spanish and Portuguese governments, where social democratic parties have swung leftwards after making <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/12/spain-ruling-socialists-strike-coalition-deal-with-podemos-sanchez\">pacts with the radical left</a>. It is no coincidence that younger voters in the US, Spain, Portugal and the UK embraced the new left movements at the same time, from Bernie Sanders to Podemos: free-market ideology robbed them of security and prosperity, leading them to demand radical answers.</p> <p>That isn\u2019t going to change: and that\u2019s why the left is going precisely nowhere. Why, at the very moment our ideas have been consecrated as the party\u2019s mainstream, would we perform hari-kari? That remains the success of Corbyn and his supporters and cannot be airbrushed from history despite the undoubted attempts to do so. As it was under Attlee, Hugh Gaitskell and Harold Wilson, the left is a legitimate power within the party again, one which cannot be ignored.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/coronavirus-britain-economy-government-blame-labour\">Blaming Labour won't work this time \u2013 the Tories will have to own this crisis  | Larry Elliott</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Starmer has committed to the policies long advocated by the left; and so the left\u2019s role now is to act as the protectors and defenders of those ideas, to ensure that those red lines are not violated, and to develop a vision of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/coronavirus-crisis-new-society\">what post-coronavirus Britain will look like</a>. The left may have succeeded in giving otherwise cautious Labour politicians the courage of their convictions again, but pressure must be maintained to ensure this remains so. While the left has understandably expended much energy on electoral politics in the past five years, in post-pandemic Britain there must be a revival in extra-parliamentary struggles \u2013 from the climate emergency to workers\u2019 rights \u2013 to build popular support for a decisive rupture from a broken status quo.</p> <p>Unlike most Labour leaders, Starmer\u2019s politics is rooted in extra-parliamentary politics: those instincts should be appealed to. Those who hoped that a Starmer triumph would end the remorseless attacks from the rightwing media will soon be disappointed: it will fall to the left to push back against them. And while many Labour MPs, for a time, will be relieved that their Corbynite nightmare is over, the party\u2019s right went for Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband as well as Corbyn. They will come for Starmer, too: the Labour leader may find his only genuine defenders are the left.</p> <p>Starmer has many challenges, not least winning back older voters who have abandoned Labour. But the left should wish him well; the quid pro quo is Starmer stands by his promises. Now is the time for critical friendship, to wish a genuinely decent and progressive politician well: because his success is our only chance to rid the UK of the cruel injustices that both scar and define our society.</p> <p>\u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p>",

The Corbynite left of the party had backed Long-Bailey for leader and Burgon for deputy, but neither came close to challenging the eventual winners, indicating appetite among the membership and supporters for a change of direction following Labour\u2019s election defeat in December.</p> \n<p>The former shadow Brexit secretary is consideredsofter-left than Corbyn, but he has promised the former leader\u2019s supporters not to steer too far away from his predecessor\u2019s radical policy programme of nationalisation and fighting austerity.</p> \n<p>The MP for Holborn and St Pancras will now start to put together a shadow cabinet and a team of advisers that is expected to draw from all wings of the party in an effort to draw a line under the factionalism that has dogged Labour in recent years.

  "<p>Detainees in a US immigration jail are begging to be released after potential Covid-19 exposure, saying the conditions are so brutal that they would rather suffer deportation<strong> </strong>than remain locked up.</p> <p>Three men incarcerated at the Winn correctional center in a remote part of Louisiana told the Guardian that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) has isolated 44 of them together after they were possibly exposed to coronavirus. Some of the detainees are so desperate to leave that they are seeking voluntary deportation. They say their cries for masks, hand sanitizer, gloves and cleaning supplies have gone ignored, including for elderly detainees and those with asthma.</p> <p>In a series of phone calls, the men described a nightmare ordeal over the last two weeks, citing rampant mistreatment and a terrifying lack of information from Ice after they learned they were under some kind of quarantine. They also said that seven of their fellow detainees were deported on a flight to Colombia this week, four days into a 14-day quarantine period, which would appear to violate basic standards of coronavirus containment.</p> <p>Their firsthand accounts escalate concerns that human rights lawyers have been raising for weeks, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/29/detainees-coronavirus-us-immigration-ice\">Ice jails could become death traps</a> during the pandemic and that the only way to save lives and slow the spread is to release people en masse.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are writing to the judge that they want to be deported as soon as possible. They don\u2019t want to continue fighting,\u201d said a detainee from El Salvador in his 30s, who declined to give his name. He said he was trying to self-deport and was also helping an asylum seeker seek deportation. \u201cHe told me, \u2018I\u2019d prefer to go home instead of being in this jail.\u2019 \u2026 Ice has to release all the people, immediately.\u201d</p> <p>One of the detainees speaking out and advocating for the release of immigrant prisoners is Dr Sirous Asgari, an Iranian scientist who was exonerated in a US trial last year but continues to face detention. The 59-year-old professor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/sirous-asgari-coronavirus-us-ice-immigration-detention\">shared his story with the Guardian</a> last week, prompting Iran\u2019s foreign minister to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JZarif/status/1243504082050068481\">call</a> for his release.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"653a1b5e92f11e5fedf550fce62cf0bfd364e7f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/653a1b5e92f11e5fedf550fce62cf0bfd364e7f2/0_327_4032_2419/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Sirous Asgari at his graduation from Drexel University.

He heard that a detainee had a fever. But Ice, he alleged, gave the detainees no information and declined to tell them whether it was Covid-19.</p> <p>\u201cEverybody got panicked,\u201d he said, describing a chaotic scene of the detainees yelling for help and information. \u201cWe had two elderly people in their 70s, younger people with respiratory problems. One guy is crying, saying, \u2018My life is in danger, we have been exposed.\u2019 People were screaming, \u2018Give us masks!\u2019 \u2026 \u2018We\u2019re gonna die!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>One officer suggested there was nothing to worry about, but then staff kept the pod completely isolated from other detainees, suggesting they were under quarantine, Asgari said. Despite what seemed to be a strict quarantine, seven of them were deported to Colombia a few days later, he said.</p> <p>Roughly 30 men who remained behind were then taken to Winn, but were still given no information, the detainees said. But once they had medical visits, he said they confirmed their fears after asking the nurse to look at their records, which all said \u201cpossible exposure to Covid-19\u201d and listed as 8 April as a \u201crelease date\u201d which would be the end of a 14-day quarantine period. The men joined a dozen other detainees in that facility who were also suspected of having exposure, Asgari said.</p> <p>Bryan Cox, an Ice spokesman, declined to respond to many of their specific claims, but said no detainee has tested positive for Covid-19 at ASF. He did not answer questions about whether the men were given tests or whether there was a direct exposure or quarantine. He said Ice groups detainees in \u201cmedical cohorts\u201d, meaning separating potential Covid-19 patients from others, but said that a \u201ccohort for potential exposure does not mean a person has been exposed\u201d.</p> <p>He said the men were spreading \u201cunsubstantiated rumor and false allegations\u201d, but did not offer specifics.</p> <p>\u201cWe are just a number to them. They don\u2019t care,\u201d said a detainee in his 30s who is facing deportation to Guatemala, and was also moved from ASF to Winn alongside Asgari. \u201cI\u2019m really afraid \u2026 They put you in jail with all these people and you don\u2019t know where they\u2019ve come from. It doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d</p> <p>This detainee said he had lived in the US for more than a decade and that he was arrested in New York in mid-March as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/31/ice-raids-coronavirus-n95-masks\">Ice continued its raids and arrests</a> amid the worsening pandemic. He said he has little information about his case and is fighting to get out: \u201cI\u2019m trying to do something, but I can\u2019t. I haven\u2019t seen a judge, nothing. They are just moving me around.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Disgusting\u2019 conditions and silence from Ice</h2> <p>The men said the conditions at Winn were appalling. The detainees are responsible for all cleaning, and there is a single shower and only two toilets for all 44 of them to share. They are also sleeping on beds roughly two feet apart from each other, and the humidity when they first arrived left the sheets wet and beds rusted, they alleged.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we got inside, everyone was absolutely shocked at the living conditions,\u201d said Asgari, who has a history of respiratory problems and is at risk of death. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating, disgusting and humiliating. We get outside for one hour a day. That\u2019s the only good thing.\u201d</p> <p>By Friday, a majority of the detainees were suffering from some kind of cold, according to Asgari, who said he now has a bad cough and fears it will infect his lungs. They don\u2019t have fevers, and he said he hopes it\u2019s not coronavirus.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4edf433365dfc9309bac1535e78e52ad3ffe389\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4edf433365dfc9309bac1535e78e52ad3ffe389/0_95_2845_1707/1000..jpg\" alt=\"A bed at the Winn correctional center where some migrants have been isolated after exposure to coronavirus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A bed at the Winn correctional center where some migrants have been isolated after exposure to coronavirus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerald Herbert/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The man from El Salvador said the staff at Winn were taking their temperatures daily, but otherwise doing little else related to Covid-19 prevention.

But ultimately, he said he was desperate to get out, fearing staff could bring the virus to the facility or that he could be moved again and exposed to hundreds more detainees in other jails.</p> <p>One Ice officer told him he could submit a formal request and get a reply in seven or eight days, he said: \u201cI want to know what is happening with us.

  "<p>In early 2017, I was invited<strong> </strong>to a four-week artist residency in Lisbon, Portugal. The residency was not particularly prestigious: it charged a fee for the room I was to stay in, a barely habitable space perched above a gallery behind a series of locked doors. The bed for my partner and I was a mattress on a stack of shipping crates; the kitchenette was little more than a microwave and a bar fridge.</p> <p>To cover the residency fee, I applied for and received a small literary grant. In my application, I wrote that \u201cengaging readers and collaborators internationally\u201d would be a \u201cvital step in my career development\u201d. The residency would enable me to \u201clearn new creative methodologies in transdisciplinary artistic workshops, alongside a host of international artists\u201d and give me the opportunity to present my work \u201cwithin an international context\u201d for the first time.</p> <p>None of this was technically a lie. I <em>was</em> a resident at the gallery; I <em>did</em> share pasta dinners and cheap wine with the other artists \u2013 from Brazil, Wales, Argentina. And we did discuss our respective projects, which might have been called presenting my work within an international context. But it wasn\u2019t the whole truth, either.</p> <p>My reason for being in Lisbon (I had plotted and planned to get back there) was to find court documents related to a sexual assault that had been committed against me in the city 11 years earlier, when I was 18 years old.</p> <p>I read somewhere that the average age of a first violent sexual assault \u2013 for victims and perpetrators of rape or attempted rape \u2013 is 18 and a half. I haven\u2019t been able to verify this statistic. Online, there are many different authoritative-sounding claims about ages and likelihoods: 16 to 19 for victims; 28 to 33 for perpetrators. Because of taboos and improper reporting methods, sexual assault data is not as strong as it should be. But that number, that 18 and a half, seemed right to me, stuck with me, because it was <em>my</em> number. That is exactly how old I was when, overseas for the first time, on a sabbatical from full-time study, I was lured, then kidnapped, then subjected to an attempted rape by two young men, Tomas and Salvator, in an apartment just outside Lisbon. It is exactly how old I was when I fought and screamed and ran, early morning, down a hill, through shrubbery, along a highway, where a cop picked me up and drove me back to the city, and groped my leg as I considered rolling out the door of the moving vehicle.</p> <p>Eighteen and a half: just old enough to make serious claims on my independence; old enough to insist on taking responsibility for the risks involved in becoming a whole person. Eighteen and a half: so unbearably young.</p> <p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>Lisbon, May, 2006. Outside the club, I dangled my legs over the edge of the wide river, my feet swinging like a purse at the end of a long strap. Above me was Lisbon\u2019s big red bridge, just like the Golden Gate in San Francisco. The girl I had gone to the club with, the woman I had bonded with earlier in the night, was kissing her new man inside while I waited. Her hair was long and wavy, and she laughed at all my jokes. I was vaguely embarrassed that she\u2019d brought me there to sit and wait for her. I smoked cigarette after cigarette and talked to two young men at the edge of the water. Boys, really. Were they business students? I am Australian. They longed to visit Australia. So we swapped email addresses, just as I had swapped them, dropped them, in every city I had stepped through along the way.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Outside the club, I smoked cigarettes and talked to two young men. At 6am, they suggested we get breakfast</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At daybreak, 6am or so, the club closed and the boys suggested we get breakfast, \u201cthe best pastel de Bel\u00e9m in Bel\u00e9m\u201d. I went to say goodbye to my new friend. She told me not to go with them.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with them,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019m a big girl<em>.\u201d</em> The woman with long wavy hair wrote her number on a piece of card that I slipped into my wallet. I didn\u2019t have a phone.</p> <p>At 29, in 2017, I was not in denial about any of it. Not really. I had told the story of me in Lisbon at 18 hundreds of times. From the morning of the assault, I told anyone who would listen. The more I simplified the story, the more comfortable with it I became; I integrated the facts of it into my identity. I had been terrified, I said, but I wasn\u2019t harmed, not beyond repair. While afterwards I trusted people a little less, I said, I didn\u2019t fear sex, or men, or even travelling alone. I even told a psychologist about it once, and then quickly assured him that it was absolutely <em>not</em> the cause of my distress. I didn\u2019t think about the word \u201ctrauma\u201d until years later, when I noticed that my nerves could not hold still, not even in a minor crisis. Like when a little white dog we all thought had been killed at the traffic lights, popped out from under the bonnet a second later, unharmed. A kinky nothing said to me by a lover in bed, the same words that one of my assailants said as he pinned down my wrists, urging his friend to violate me. A kitchen fire at a dinner party, where the thud of terror yelled, \u201cDon\u2019t try to fight it \u2013 run\u201d<em>,</em> to my embarrassment, while friends successfully smothered the flames with tea towels. The fantasy that things are somehow safe, which you need to have if you are to do anything at all, had been pulled right out from under me.</p> <p>By the third day of the residency, I had settled in, and felt ready to start looking for the documents from the trial. I got the number for the police station and made plans to call.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5f757c42e87f3d50f86ce9c68b76f641363512a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f757c42e87f3d50f86ce9c68b76f641363512a1/0_63_1600_959/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Savage aged 18\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Savage aged 18: \u2018Old enough to take risks, still unbearably young.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Ellena Savage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I did not call the police that day. Instead I read, I chatted with other artists, I walked around the city. I looked out at the Atlantic Ocean from the edge of Lisbon, and I felt the mound of tension in my stomach grow. I wouldn\u2019t work up the courage to call the number for the police until the sixth day.</p> <p>\u201cI have a strange request,\u201d I said to the officer on the other end. \u201cIn 2006, I was the victim of a crime in Lisbon, and it went to court. But I had to leave Portugal before I was able to find out what happened, so I\u2019d like to see if I can track down the documents from this time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOK,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it was 11 years ago. The problem is, 11 years later, our paper has absolutely no meaning whatsoever.\u201d</p> <p>\u201c\u2018Absolutely no meaning whatsoever\u2019,\u201d I repeated. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p> <p>The man explained his brilliant mistranslation: \u201cIt means,\u201d he said, \u201cthat the situation was a long time ago and the situation is in the archives; it has been archived for 10 years.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs it possible to access the file from the archives? I don\u2019t intend to pursue the matter, I just want to read it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can print it for you,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it has absolutely no meaning. If you want, you can send an email to the police. The situation is that we don\u2019t give the police report in an email.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll come in person,\u201d I said, and hung up, put my shoes on, and left the gallery.</p> <p>My partner and I walked to the police station downtown. I sat on a plastic chair to wait my turn, just as I had 11 years earlier. Back then, my organs had felt heavy from no sleep, from the trauma, from the traces of alcohol still in my blood. Yet I managed to perform the role of a strong, reliable, resilient witness to my own assault. I was chipper and businesslike. I buried my shame deep alongside my fear and I gave my statement, describing how two young men had conspired to rape me and almost succeeded, but I had escaped by agreeing to other acts of violence, and then by my hysteria, and then by my physical desperation to flee. I was so chipper that, once I\u2019d finished and signed my statement, the policeman taking down my report wrote his number on a piece of paper and said, \u201cI finish at 10 \u2013 let me take you out and show you the <em>real</em> Lisbon<em>.\u201d</em></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One of my attackers lost his cool and burst into tears. I'm convinced that if he hadn\u2019t, I would not be alive</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the station in 2017, I explained myself. I was looking for the documents, the paper that has absolutely no meaning whatsoever. The officer behind the desk printed off what he could find: the initial report I made in 2006. Then, he sent me to another office, an enormous, modern building a half-hour\u2019s walk away.</p> <p>At the Pol\u00edcia Judici\u00e1ria, I explained six, seven, eight more times what I was now referring to as \u201cthe situation\u201d. Finally, someone seemed to understand what I was after. The report. The file. The verdict of the trial that I never found out. I was told to wait.</p> <p>After an hour waiting in the vast lobby, a detective, Cristina, came out to explain that I would need to call yet another department. There would be a different reference number for my case: my name had been incorrectly spelled in the initial report. I thanked her, and walked the five miles back to the gallery.</p> <p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>In court, in 2006, before I left Portugal, the two boys\u2019 lawyers were each allowed to ask me a question. Tomas\u2019s lawyer wanted to know if I thought that his client was sorry for what he\u2019d done. \u201cYes,\u201d I said, knowing that this was true. He was, I believed, horrified by what he had done.</p> <p>Salvator\u2019s lawyer asked whether it was true that I\u2019d said, before his client took me to an apartment, locked me in a room and pinned me down with the intention to rape me, \u201cTake me home and I\u2019ll fuck you\u201d? I leapt up. \u201cNo! No, that\u2019s not true. No, I\u2019ve never said that to anyone.\u201d Which was true. I had never even thought of that constellation of words before.</p> <p>While it was Tomas\u2019s cowardice that got me into that room that sorry morning (he could not stand up to his domineering friend), it was his cowardice that got me out, too. As I kicked and screamed under the boys\u2019 weight, heaving-crying and thinking that I would die, I desperately repeated, \u201cI\u2019ll do anything, just please don\u2019t hurt me.\u201d In that moment, I had a split-second vision that determined everything else I did to survive. The picture was viewed from above: my body being dismembered and thrown into the Atlantic.</p> <p>Tomas \u2013 the coward, my hero \u2013 lost his cool. He burst into tears and rolled off the bed. And it was suddenly clear to Salvator that he couldn\u2019t handle the rape on his own, not under the witness of his failed collaborator. And I repeated the mantra, \u201cI\u2019ll do anything, just please don\u2019t hurt me.\u201d And Tomas continued to cry and shouted at Salvator in Portuguese. And Salvator shouted, in English, \u201cYou\u2019re not leaving.\u201d I found my shirt and my skirt and my shoes and I bundled them up in my arms. Salvator and Tomas screamed at one another. I pulled on some of my clothes. And Tomas said to me, \u201cCome on.\u201d And I moved towards the door. And Tomas made as if to open it. And we, one of us, opened it. And Salvator slammed his arm between me and the door. \u201cAre you afraid?\u201d And I knew he was a psychopath.</p> <p>So when Tomas\u2019s lawyer asked if I thought he was sorry, I thought: yes, Tomas was sorry. I am convinced that if Tomas had not been there, I would not be alive, that Salvator would have raped and murdered me right there. I am convinced that my family and friends might never have discovered what had happened to me. Decades would have passed, and my mother would still be looking for me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"708673a957f7d9edee6663fc54c62891af5e5cc7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/708673a957f7d9edee6663fc54c62891af5e5cc7/0_219_6558_3935/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Savage in Melbourne, March 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I buried my shame deep alongside my fear.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlie Kinross/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A week into my residency, I had the number of the office that was holding my files. I called every day. Yet every time I called, something intervened. My Skype app automatically updated itself. The sketchy gallery internet dropped out. The receptionist couldn\u2019t understand me and hung up. After days of this, I tried the other number, the number that Cristina had given me in case I needed to reach her, and no one picked up. When finally I got through, I explained myself to an English-speaking receptionist, who put me on hold while I was transferred to another officer who didn\u2019t speak English.</p> <p>Each time I spoke to someone new, I explained \u201cthe situation\u201d. Each time, it felt like a punch in the face. Like a boxer, I prepared myself for each blow. Yet when each one came, I was stunned.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What I was looking for did not exist. Closure. Resolution. The true story. But none of it mattered, not really</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Finally, I reached Cristina. \u201cYou want a copy of the investigation? Call back on Monday,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a lot of work today.\u201d</p> <p>I crossed my fingers and set an alarm, as if I could forget. I absent-mindedly wrote in my notebook: \u201cThis is my story. Yet I cannot find the documents. They are mine.\u201d</p> <p>I understood that just because something happened to me, it didn\u2019t suspend the suppressions of time and the failures of memory and the most human of all errors, bureaucratic filing systems.</p> <p>It did not escape me, either, that what I was looking for did not exist. Closure. Resolution. The true story. I wanted a copy of the investigation, which had been archived for 10 years and was seemingly impossible to dredge up; I wanted to find out how Salvator and Tomas described the events in their words, if only so I could scoff at their lies; I wanted to know what judgment concluded the trial, if only to suffer through a not-guilty verdict. But none of it mattered, not really. None of it could push the factory-reset button, or assist my interior life, except to make me remember things my body had buried.</p> <p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>On the 17th day, Cristina called and said I was to go to the district court in a distant precinct where she had discovered the file had been archived.</p> <p>The regional train raced past the docklands, beneath the red bridge, out towards the beach. To the left, the Atlantic Ocean opened up before me, slick and chilly. To the right, blond apartments emerged in rows from the thick green hills strewn with wild yellow flowers. It was in there, in one of those apartments, that it had happened.</p> <p>We found the courthouse, stark, fascist, Latin-white. I gave the young receptionist my notebook, where I had written my list of demands in Google Translate Portuguese. She called over an older woman with plump cheeks who spoke English. \u201cYou must apply to see the process file,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has already been archived.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat is your reason?\u201d she said. \u201cWhy do you want to see it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI had to leave Portugal. I never found out what happened.\u201d</p> <p>The woman looked at the computer screen and typed. Finally, she said, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you the sentence, but I can say the man, the accused, his sentence was annulled.\u201d</p> <p>I blinked. \u201cOh,\u201d I said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"47ecce4487d55fd3856584a60b67c450ee6cfff8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47ecce4487d55fd3856584a60b67c450ee6cfff8/0_0_2592_1944/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Savage with a friend while travelling in Europe, 2006\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Savage with a friend while travelling in Europe, 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Ellena Savage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou will need to fill out a form to find the <em>senten\u00e7a</em>, the precise judgement.

The police report, the court notes, the verdict.</p> <p>The court\u2019s archivist, Jo\u00e3o, was gentle and authoritative. Exactly as he ought to be, I thought. He smoothed his hand over the open pages of the two thick binders, talking me through everything that had happened after I left.</p> <p>Salvator corroborated my testimony. He was not charged. Tomas was prosecuted. He was given a suspended sentence of 12 months and required to pay \u20ac500 to a victims\u2019 support organisation. Tomas then appealed, and his sentence was annulled.</p> <p>As Jo\u00e3o methodically copied the documents, I swung around to my partner. \u201cBut Salvator was the evil one,\u201d I say. \u201cSalvator. Not Tomas.\u201d And, of course, I knew in an instant that my memory was wrong. I must have, at some point, switched the names and faces. And if I had been so certain about something so wrong, what else? What else had I changed?</p> <p>Another day, another anxious train ride home, I thought. But this time the anxiety had an object. I had their full names.</p> <p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>Back at the gallery, I typed their names into a search engine, but not much came up. Their names were common. I wanted revenge. I thought about hiring a private detective. And then, I found the private Facebook account of one Tomas with the same succession of middle and surnames as my assailant.</p> <p>I wrote him a message: \u201cDo you know me.\u201d</p> <p>Back at the gallery, I began to type passages from the court documents into Google Translate. I began to read a broken translation of Salvator\u2019s statement. What it revealed stopped me in my tracks. The two boys had been speaking in Portuguese as they assaulted me, and I was too traumatised to notice. I am lucky I didn\u2019t understand what they said to one another. Tomas\u2019s deliberation and cruelty had been much worse than I\u2019d known.</p> <p>I read as much as I could, which was not much, and closed my laptop. My partner and I packed our things and flew home.</p> <p>The documents are in a folder at the bottom of a box in my wardrobe. Tomas never responded to the Facebook message. I never hired a private detective. Something in me settled. I didn\u2019t like the story \u2013 I still don\u2019t like to think what might be necessary for a perpetrator of sexual assault to get a conviction \u2013 but I accepted it as a small part of my life that I could know, as much as I could know anything.

Thousands of migrants remain stuck in Libyan detention centres, where they are subjected to torture and abuse. According to the UNHCR, the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on departures by sea from Libya is not yet clear. Certainly, given the absence of NGO rescue boats, attempting to reach Europe from North Africa has become increasingly risky in recent months.</p> <p>Since the beginning of the coronavirus emergency, many charities committed to saving migrants in the central Mediterranean have temporarily abandoned their activities at sea and transferred their resources, including doctors and other health workers, to European hospitals. Long attacked by the Italian government and affected by unjustified judicial investigations, teams from M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) and the Spanish NGO Proactiva Open Arms are providing support to the Italian health authorities.</p> <p>MSF staff are based in four hospitals in areas of the northern Italian province of Lodi, part of Lombardy, the country\u2019s worst-hit region. Even Open Arms doctors are now on the frontlines in Italian hospitals, including Bergamo. Mediterranea Saving Humans, an Italian NGO normally engaged in the rescue of migrants at sea, has launched a \u201ctelephone emergency room\u201d for psychological support in areas worst affected by Covid-19.</p> <p>With the German NGO Sea-Watch waiting to return to sea \u2013 their boat is moored in Sicily \u2013 the only ship currently operating in the central Mediterranean is the Alan Kurdi.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/18/ngos-raise-alarm-as-coronavirus-strips-support-from-eu-refugees\">NGOs raise alarm as coronavirus strips support from EU refugees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe have set up booths for the isolation of any patients with symptoms of Covid-19 or tuberculosis,\u2019\u2019 says Ribbeck. \u201cWe cannot do the tests onboard because the swabs must be shipped to specialised centres.

  "<h2>Alone in Alaska</h2> <p><strong>\u2018I opened myself to a world that would continue long after our money-grubbing species was gone\u2019</strong></p> <p>I once lived in isolation. Profound isolation. I was 30, and I had built a cabin 300 miles from the nearest road, deep in the wilderness of the Alaskan interior, 90 miles south of the Arctic Circle. I had always worshipped nature, and after five years of planning I managed to escape the office, or what I used to call \u201ccubicle hell\u201d.</p> <p>I had to cut a mile-long portage through bush and forest up to a beaver lake, where I cleared a site for the cabin amid stands of white spruce, birch and cottonwood trees. While I was building the cabin, I lived in a tent. I laid spruce boughs on the cold ground and a tarp over that, and built a strange bedframe of springy birch. I had a grub box with salt and pepper, coffee and whisky, dried beans, rice, flour, bacon, oil and sugar. I had a spoon for eating, a frying pan and a kettle. And a .22 rifle for hunting.</p> <p>As winter began to tighten, the Yukon river became unnavigable, strewn with ice floes the size of cars, and the little beaver lake began to emit long ululating pings and warbling sounds \u2013 the \u201cice singing\u201d. No bush plane could land on the lake.</p> <p>This was lockdown Alaska-style, and it was the perfect place to lose my mind. I kept sane by imposing a routine of reward and work.</p> <p> I let myself sleep in late only on Sundays. Mealtimes and cooking became a ceremony of wellbeing, and after 5pm each night a large tot of whisky provided the reward. My fire became winter\u2019s fruit to me. I stopped thinking of the outside world and cultivated a joy in little things, and in simplicity.</p> <p>Books allowed me to travel and guided my thoughts. I found unexpected solace in Alexander Solzhenitsyn\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/04/nobelprize.russia2\">The Gulag Archipelago</a>. He\u2019d been confined in Siberia for 11 years \u2026 a year on the same latitude would surely be child\u2019s play in comparison. Also, he was surrounded by people, whereas I was my own jailor, safe within nature \u2013 and with my camp dog, Fuzzy.</p> <p> During my little forays outside I watched nature \u2013 beavers hauled the last of their food supplies to underwater \u201cstick-piles\u201d and a wolf pack settled on Pilot Mountain, their howls rising before being whipped away by the winds barrelling in from Russia. In the very early hours I\u2019d often stare up at the northern lights. I opened myself to the fresh simplicity of a world that would continue long after our money-grubbing species was gone.</p> <p>Later on, when I could travel again, I journeyed seven hours by dogsled to the small town of Galena. Outside the general store an Athabascan woman, learning that I was living alone, laughed: \u201cSounds like you got a good camp \u2013 but without a woman it\u2019s only a half life.\u201d And she was right. Sex or no sex, if you\u2019re lucky enough to be with people, take this time to go on journeys with them, journeys that life and its pressures don\u2019t normally allow. There\u2019s a million miles of wilderness within people, which you may have taken for granted for years.<br><strong>Guy Grieve, author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Call-Wild-My-Escape-Alaska/dp/0340898259\">Call of the Wild: My Escape to Alaska</a></strong></p> <h2>Just me and my spud in the Falklands</h2> <p><strong>\u2018I placed the potato on the kitchen counter.

I was 27, and after a decade of distraction at the hands of friends, family and strangers on Twitter, I sought out the most isolated place I could find: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/jun/04/bleaker-island-falklands-penguins-nell-stevens-bleaker-house-book\">Bleaker Island</a> in the Falklands, a small patch of grass, mud and rock in the south-east corner of the archipelago, facing Antartica. It had a permanent population of two, and in the winter, when I planned to visit, they spent much of their time elsewhere.</p> <p>Bleaker Island was very bleak indeed: horizontal snow, a few freezing farm buildings, the guesthouse in which I rented a room, and a thriving colony of gentoo penguins. I lived there for several weeks, learning how to be alone and trying to write a novel.</p> <p>I had brought all my food with me. Mindful of the baggage limit on the little plane that dropped me off, I\u2019d limited myself to items that were light and calorific: nuts and raisins, instant soups, powdered fibre. I tried to make peace with this diet. I was not there to eat, after all, but to write.</p> <p>About a week into my stay, one of the two permanent residents knocked on my door and held out a potato. She was about to leave the island for a while, she said, and had one spare. The potato was weighty, slightly earthy. It was the opposite of my just-add-water provisions. I carried it back through the empty house like a trophy, and placed it on the kitchen counter. I told myself I\u2019d save it for a really bad day.</p> <p>I developed a routine. About mid-morning, when I was already running out of writing steam and counting the hours until I could reasonably go back to bed, I went to visit the potato. It squatted next to the kettle, reassuring and increasingly wrinkled. It sprouted a tentative tendril, and then another. Every day I asked myself: is today bad enough to warrant a potato? And every day the answer was no, in case the next day turned out to be worse.</p> <p>When I reached the end of my stay on the island, my novel was unfinished and so was the potato. But if it hadn\u2019t been there, I think, every day would have been worse. Now, in this time of enforced isolation, so different from the personal experiment of my sojourn on Bleaker Island, I still seek out comforts I can defer, possibility always more consoling than reality.<br><strong>Nell Stevens, author of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/28/mrs-gaskell-and-me-nell-stevens-review-desire-satire\"> Mrs Gaskell &amp; Me</a></strong></p> <h2>Isolated in Iceland</h2> <p><strong>\u2018Stuck between four walls, </strong><strong>solitude soon became the enemy\u2019</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b2e4cdeaa92b748b7bad5f36d062a845b0db9903\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2e4cdeaa92b748b7bad5f36d062a845b0db9903/0_0_3620_2715/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Phoebe Smith in Iceland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Phoebe Smith in Iceland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phoebe Smith</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The race was going to be a close finish. The initial leader of the pack was being gained on and, with just centimetres to go to the finish line, the top spot really was anyone\u2019s. I felt myself move to the edge of my seat, rooting desperately for number three to clinch it. But as the drama reached a crescendo, the wind blew hard and a shower of around seven other raindrops splatted on to the glass, merging the three I was following into a small, indistinguishable puddle. It was all over.</p> <p>This was day two of me being stuck, alone, in a hikers\u2019 hut in Iceland, and already I was playing a game of windowpane raindrop races to try and pass the time.</p> <p>After hiking in on the first day, I had planned to climb a nearby summit, overnight, then head back. But as soon as I reached the wooden hut, in thick cloud and heavy rain, I knew that any mountain climbing was out of the question. I only had limited food (water could be sourced from a stream outside), so my first job was to implement a rationing system. This was easy for the first hour, but a few more in I wanted to scoff my entire supply of Mars bars in a single sitting.</p> <p>Being alone is something I usually love \u2013 and that I head outdoors to achieve \u2013 but here, stuck between four walls, solitude soon became the enemy. The only way I could see myself emerging from here in the next however many days with my sanity intact was to organise my waking hours into a schedule.</p> <p>The morning involved an hour\u2019s exercise, garnered from moves I could remember from my zumba class, reorganising my kit, and reading aloud \u2013 which entailed badly acting out parts from half of a climbing book someone had left behind (I vowed to write the other half myself if I was stuck here for a long time).</p> <p>Lunch became all about ceremony: trying to make a dehydrated packet meal look like something from a gourmet restaurant. The afternoon involved chores \u2013 from collecting water to finding something to fix in the hut, or among my kit \u2013 and my daily challenge of finding something to be thankful for: a wildflower on the doorstep, a nearly complete set of cards strewn in a drawer, a forgotten bag of jelly babies found in a rucksack pocket.</p> <p>In short, during isolation, and with the end date unknown, it all came down to the little things. And, if I got really stuck, there was always raindrop racing\u2026<br><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/phoebe-smith\">Phoebe Smith</a>, adventurer, presenter and author</strong></p> <h2>On a vision quest in the Pyrenees</h2> <p><strong>\u2018When a large shadow appeared in the trees, my heart began to hammer\u2019</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"06270b25a3998ca22cbacda1bb636a0def246364\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06270b25a3998ca22cbacda1bb636a0def246364/0_160_4320_2590/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Jini Reddy in the Pyrenees \u2013 the was image taken with an old-fashioned camera and timer as she had no phone with her.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jini Reddy in the Pyrenees \u2013 the was image taken with an old-fashioned camera and timer as she had no phone with her.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jini Reddy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A few years ago I spent five days and four nights wild camping alone, high in the Pyrenees. I had my tent, plenty of water and, intentionally, almost no food. I could hear nothing but the tinkling of sheep bells in the valley below, and above I saw nothing but clear blue sky. I wondered if the birds of prey soaring overhead might be eagles.</p> <p>I was on a version of a vision quest \u2013 the traditional rite of passage ceremony practised by many indigenous cultures across the world, including the Native American Lakota and Hopi people. The person on the quest goes into nature for several days to communicate with a sacred, sentient Earth, in search of answers to a big life question, or to mark a transition. The aim is to gain insight, knowledge, strength and self-understanding. He or she sits within a circle of a few feet, and doesn\u2019t move about much. The journey is an inner one.</p> <p>Even an adapted, westernised version of such a ceremony can gift you a new sense of self-reliance, resilience and the ability to be alone and move through fear to strength.</p> <p>It was the height of summer in the Pyrenees. I\u2019d given my phone and watch to the guide who\u2019d walked me up here. When I saw him disappearing down the mountain, I curled up into a ball, and wept out of relief and exhaustion.</p> <p>When the sun went down, I felt scared \u2013 of the darkness and what might be out there. Scared of the unknown, beyond my control. There was no one to turn to for reassurance. Fear is a funny thing, and what I learned that night \u2013 it was always the nights I found challenging \u2013 is that if you sit with your fear for long enough, allow yourself to feel it and don\u2019t push it away, it dissolves.</p> <p>Adjacent to my spot was a dark forest, and the tales I\u2019d heard about who or <em>what</em> lived in the forest made me increasingly anxious. In the end, I forced myself to go and sit in that forest. When a large shadow appeared in the trees, my heart began to hammer. It turned out to be a wild horse. Another fear, faced down.</p> <p>Towards the end of my stay I began to miss people, miss <em>doing </em>things, miss being able to make choices, and I felt a rush of gratitude for the richness of my daily life, which I\u2019d so often taken for granted. So being able to sit with my fears, to know that I can turn to nature when it all gets too much, and remind myself to be thankful for what I do have \u2013 such are the things I draw upon in these difficult times.<br><strong>Jini Reddy, author of <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/wanderland-9781472951939/\">Wanderland</a></strong></p> <h2><strong>One family, one island in the Faroes</strong></h2> <p>\u2018<strong>When we have a conversation, it\u2019s a proper one\u2019</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8ce0ae131ee1a50dfd91023748c70fbba50866b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ce0ae131ee1a50dfd91023748c70fbba50866b3/0_0_2976_2232/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Eva and J\u00f3gvan J\u00f3n \u00far D\u00edmun are on the right.

But Health was still preparing and doing all they needed to do, doing all the work behind the scenes and they took it upon themselves to step up the protocol that they had previously applied for many years to other infectious diseases. So when the 6 March protocol came from the federal government, basically making it discretionary, they [NSW Health] didn\u2019t adopt that. The Health team, the senior practitioner, decided they were going to do an assessment on every ship and that is what they did. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Given the risk assessment they did \u2013 regardless of federal advice they did not have to do an assessment \u2013 the NSW Health staff decided the ship was low risk as only flu was found, and at non-outbreak levels. However, they did order everyone to go home and self-isolate anyway, the chief health officer <strong>Kerry Chant </strong>says. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T00:52:57.250Z\">at 1.52am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e87d5858f08c35a1d119c3b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T00:41:10.233Z\">1.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>I have to say NSW chief health officer<strong> Dr Kerry Chant</strong> is doing a tough job here, calmly explaining the steps that led to senior public health officials making the decisions they did about the Ruby Princess cruise ship while the health minister takes a back seat. One reporter in particular keeps jumping in giving her a grilling and calling on her to resign. It needs to be said that Australia Border Force also had a role to play in this saga \u2013 it\u2019s not all on <strong>NSW Health who were following protocol and assessment processes in place at the time</strong>. Chant says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> If I could just take you back to some of the facts. There was influenza circulating on the cruise ship. And we know that because the point of care test, is pretty accurate and showed it is influenza. So we know that influenza was circulating in that cruise ship, and the majority of patients, over half of the samples that were collected at the time, that the cause of illness was flu. Notwithstanding, it didn\u2019t breach the outbreak level of flu because that would have itself triggered a different response. </p> \n   <p>Can I just assure the public, because I think this is really critical, New South Wales Health has learned lessons and had extensive planning under way to actually disembark people and passengers should we suspect Covid-19 on a cruise ship, or should that have been confirmed. We had always planned to ensure self-isolation for people in the Sydney region, safe transport home through use of health share and other modes of transport and also using hotels for the accommodation of people. If we had known that Covid was on this ship, or it had of been suspected, we would have chosen that way of disembarkation.</p> \n   <p>Having said that, the people who acquired the infection, to the best of our knowledge, got it on the cruise ship. A couple of people may have acquired it earlier on with earlier onset dates and may have acquired it from other means. But certainly, the later ones acquired it on the cruise ship and the reason we suspect that amplified so quickly on the cruise ship was because we know some crew members were actually in the galley area, the food preparation area, when unwell and that would have led to a significant risk of transmission there. </p> \n   <p>So the incubation period of the disease, just to refresh everybody\u2019s memory, is 14 days. We have been following up new cases and linking it to the Ruby Princess for that period because that reflects the fact that they were infected on that time. </p> \n   <p>Be clear, the actions of New South Wales health on the day and the advice of the public health panel was based on the assessment of that information presented to them. They concluded it was a low risk, took the action and tested the results. But we would have got them off in a different way [if the risk assessment had of been high]. As I said, this goes to the fact that the clinicians knew there was activity in influenza. It was low-level influenza.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T00:44:40.202Z\">at 1.44am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e87d3d28f08c35a1d119c35\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T00:26:59.006Z\">1.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A reporter asks NSW chief health officer <strong>Dr Kerry Chant \u2013</strong> who has worked tirelessly since the epidemic began \u2013 why her resignation isn\u2019t on the premier\u2019s desk over NSW Health\u2019s handling of the Ruby Princess.

Seven of the ship\u2019s passengers have now died after getting the virus and more than 600 passenger are infected. Hazzard is angry at the criticisms, and has defended the handling of the situation by senior NSW Health staff.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> I have seen senior health staff, allI will say is that I have seen them extremely emotional because of the long hours they have worked and because of the challenges they are facing. And I find it disappointing in the strongest way possible that there can be any suggestion that those people are not doing their best. </p> \n   <p>In general terms, can I just say, this city of ours is the gateway to Australia. In normal times we pride ourselves on that. We believe that we actually do lead the way in this country, through Sydney and through New South Wales. But part of that is we have more people coming through our airports and more people coming through our ports than any other state or territory. We have more cruise ships that come through the port of Sydney than any other port in Australia. In a normal course of events, there are about 300 of these cruise ships that come in through the port of Sydney every year.<br></p> \n   <p>The very senior health staff that make the assessments on those cruise ships are actually among the world\u2019s best. There were four, generally, involved in each decision made [about the ships]. Four very senior health staff. They are specialist physicians, doctors with extraordinary training and experience in public health. We have people in that group who make these decisions who are consulting to the World Health Organization, in communicable diseases. When they make decisions, they make decisions the rest of us, if we were one-on-one with that doctor, would be very, very happy to have that advice. </p> \n   <p>I would say to all of you in the public, and actually, it is not so much, I think, the public, there are others who are making comments, but I would say to people who are being critical, know that these frontline staff are sometimes working, as<strong> Dr Kerry Chant</strong> did, she won\u2019t want me to say this, but last Saturday she worked for 31 straight hours before she stood before the media. She hadn\u2019t slept. People don\u2019t do that unless they have extraordinary commitment to all of us. </p> \n   <p><strong>What I would say to the community and to those who are leaping to criticise is, take a step back, and realise that we need everyone of these people, who have worked their hearts out, worked every aspect, every possible thing they could do to keep us safe, and we should be very temperate and careful in any criticism of those people. I think if the average person got some of the criticism that was being thrown at them, they would say, \u2018I am not doing this job any more\u2019. </strong></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T00:37:48.308Z\">at 1.37am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e87d0f08f080bdb9f533f98\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T00:15:33.338Z\">1.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>NSW health minister <strong>Brad Hazzard</strong> is once again having a go at young people for disobeying social distancing measures.

(Kushner had said: \u201cThe notion of the federal stockpile was it\u2019s supposed to be <strong><em>our</em></strong><em> </em>stockpile. It\u2019s not supposed to be states\u2019 stockpiles that they then use.\u201d)<strong><br></strong></p> \n  <p>Trump just gave a very confusing response, saying: \u201cYou know what \u2018our\u2019 means? The United States of America. Our, our, and then we take that \u2018our\u2019 and we distribute it to the states.\u201d </p> \n  <p>The reporter responded: \u201cSo why did he say it\u2019s not supposed to be states\u2019 stockpiles?\u201d</p> \n  <p>Trump: \u201cBecause we need it for the government, we need it for the federal government. To keep for our country because the federal government needs it, too, not just the states. But out of that we choose oftentimes, as an example, we have almost 10,000 ventilators and we are ready to rock...we are going to bring them to various areas of the country that need them. But when he says \u2018our\u2019 he is talking about \u201cour country\u201d he is talking about the federal government. You should be ashamed of yourself...don\u2019t make it sound bad...you just asked your question in a very nasty way.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>In fact, yesterday reporters quickly noted the stockpile is indeed meant as a resource for the states, as noted on the department of health and human services\u2019 website.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWhen state, local, tribal, and territorial responders request federal assistance to support their response efforts, the stockpile ensures that the right medicines and supplies get to those who need them most during an emergency,\u201d the website read.</p> \n  <p>But this morning, that language had been <a href=\"https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2Flive%2F2020%2Fapr%2F03%2Fcoronavirus-live-news-us-donald-trump-latest%3Fpage%3Dwith%3Ablock-5e878d5d8f08c35a1d119ae4%23block-5e878d5d8f08c35a1d119ae4\">removed</a> from the HHS website. \u201cThe Strategic National Stockpile\u2019s role is to supplement state and local supplies during public health emergencies,\u201d the website now says. \u201cMany states have products stockpiled, as well.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-03T23:47:40.191Z\">at 12.47am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e87bbc98f08c9eaf0dae380\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-03T22:51:33.316Z\">11.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Fact check: Mail-in voting</strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cA lot of people cheat\u201d with mail-in voting, Trump said.

enough one has not been found.</p> <p>He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme: \u201cWe haven\u2019t yet found one that works to be good enough to use. I get pressure on this. I get people saying \u2018oh come on it may not be perfectly accurate but can\u2019t we just use it.\u2019 The test problems is that with a test that is not of high quality you end up giving false assurance.\u201d</p> <p>People could go into harm\u2019s way when they may have immunity to the virus in those circumstances, he added.</p> <p>In another interview, Hancock described having coronavirus as a \u201cpretty unpleasant experience\u201d and said he had lost half a stone during the illness and said it was \u201clike having glass in my throat\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cFor me it was short-lived and I was able to come back to work yesterday and I\u2019m in full health. But it is worrying. I\u2019ve lost half a stone, it\u2019s quite a serious impact directly.
