If you\u2019re not sure what\u2019s open and what\u2019s closed \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/australia-coronavirus-shutdown-what-is-open-closed-places-scott-morrison\">here\u2019s a full list</a>. Sunday saw a record rise in confirmed cases, with backpacker parties in Bondi and disembarking cruise ship passengers blamed for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/coronavirus-australia-ruby-princess-cruise-ship-largest-daily-rise-cases\">steep uptick in numbers</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>A second financial stimulus package worth $66bn offers the unemployed an extra $550 a fortnight</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/22/what-australias-189bn-coronavirus-economic-rescue-package-means-for-you\">effectively doubling the rate of Newstart</a>, and increases the wage subsidy to struggling small businesses to $100,000. Economist Stephen Koukoulas argues that although the new package is a step in the right direction, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/australias-economic-rescue-package-is-a-step-in-the-right-direction-but-we-needed-a-leap\">much more will need to be done in the coming months</a>. The question now, writes political editor Katharine Murphy, is whether the Australian health system can cope <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/as-australia-goes-off-the-coronavirus-cliff-the-question-is-how-hard-will-it-land\">as cases start to rise significantly</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>In Europe, Spain has now extended its state of emergency to 15 April after 394 deaths recorded on Saturday.</strong> Residents are barred from leaving home <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/22/coronavirus-news-coronavirus-live-updates-deaths-uk-italy-lockdown-spain-us-new-york-south-america?page=with:block-5e778d8c8f08dcc95cc210c7#block-5e778d8c8f08dcc95cc210c7\">except for essential outings like buying food or seeking medical care.</a> In Italy, the government shut all non-essential businesses after 793 people died in a single day, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/italian-pm-warns-of-worst-crisis-since-ww2-as-coronavirus-deaths-leap-by-almost-800\">the largest number of people to die in one country in a 24-hour period from Covid-19</a>. German chancellor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/22/coronavirus-news-coronavirus-live-updates-deaths-uk-italy-lockdown-spain-us-new-york-south-america?page=with:block-5e77a55c8f08a08573fbf667#block-5e77a55c8f08a08573fbf667\">Angela Merkel is now in quarantine</a> after coming into contact with a doctor who tested positive. Germany has more than 22,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19, but so far only 84 deaths. The stark comparison with Italy, a country with similar numbers of people over the age of 65, continues to intrigue experts. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/germany-low-coronavirus-mortality-rate-puzzles-experts\">Germany has the lowest mortality rate of any of the countries severely hit by the epidemic; 0.3% compared with 9% in Italy and 4.6% in the UK.</a> A more widespread testing regime and a health service that has not been overrun by new cases are cited as possible reasons why. Meanwhile in the UK, prime minister Boris Johnson has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/22/uk-coronavirus-live-police-could-enforce-london-lockdown-says-khan-seven-people-die-in-wales?page=with:block-5e779c7a8f08dcc95cc21166#block-5e779c7a8f08dcc95cc21166\">decided to hold a daily press briefing</a> now the country has 5,700 positive cases. The PM\u2019s closest adviser, Dominic Cummings, has come under fire after it was reported he defended the controversial \u201cherd immunity\u201d policy by saying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/22/no-10-denies-claim-dominic-cummings-argued-to-let-old-people-die\">\u201cprotect the economy, and if that means some pensioners die, too bad\u201d</a>. Downing Street has called the allegation a \u201chighly defamatory fabrication\u201d. In France, tributes have poured in for the country\u2019s first doctor to die from the virus. Jean-Jacques Razafindranazy was a retired 68-year-old A&amp;E doctor who kept coming into work in order to help his colleagues. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/he-sacrificed-himself-tributes-to-first-french-doctor-to-die-from-coronavirus\">\u201cHe sacrificed himself,\u201d his unnamed son said.</a> \u201cHe wanted to help.

  "<p>\u201cIt was another one of those nights and I went in to the local chicken shop, as you do,\u201d Rory Best says as he remembers a drunken time long before he won the first of 124 Test caps. Despite being a Protestant from Ulster, and a man once derided for his background and body shape, Best captained Ireland 38 times, with his final game being the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/19/new-zealand-ireland-rugby-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">World Cup quarter-final defeat against New Zealand</a> last year. He is the most capped forward in Irish rugby history, and only Brian O\u2019Driscoll and Ronan O\u2019Gara have played more times for Ireland. But I like the fact that Best can bring us back to a Belfast chicken shop \u2013 from where, in his early 20s, he stumbled home and caused unintentional havoc.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/25/irelands-calling-a-journey-to-the-heart-of-a-rugby-powerhouse-donald-mcrae\">Ireland's calling: a journey to the heart of a rugby powerhouse  | Donald McRae</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m coming back and sometimes I brought keys, sometimes I didn\u2019t. At the place I was staying you could put your foot to the corner of the door and give it a nudge, and it sprung open. When I got back I tried to do that but the door didn\u2019t open. So I battered it. Eventually it burst open and I walked in. I saw this flowery wallpaper. I took two steps back because there was no flowery wallpaper in my house. I panicked, dropped everything and ran outside. I saw my house was the one next door. I raced upstairs and just fell asleep on my bed.\u201d</p> <p>When he woke the next morning Best saw his KFC takeaway littered around his neighbour\u2019s garden. He liked the old man who lived next door but, stricken with guilt, he escaped to his parents\u2019 farmhouse in Poyntzpass in County Armagh. When he returned a few days later, the neighbour opened his repaired front door and strolled over to tell young Rory he should watch out because there had been an attempted burglary. \u201cIt was a little heads-up from this lovely fella that I needed to be careful,\u201d Best says, \u201cbut really it was his way of saying: \u2018We know you\u2019re a good lad but please don\u2019t let this happen again.\u2019 I was like: \u2018OK.\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I remember only one terrible incident in the village. Two best friends, a Protestant and a Catholic, were shot dead</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A sheepish Best turned away, only to be called back by the neighbour who handed him his credit card which had been found in the garden. Best shakes his head in embarrassment. \u201cIn those days I just thought you played the game hard, and partied hard. I had to find it in myself to change. Some people never find it. And some people are lucky like me \u2013 they discover it early enough in their career to change.\u201d</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.hodder.co.uk/titles/rory-best/my-autobiography/9781529362428/\" title=\"\">his new autobiography</a> Best is bracingly honest about his youthful ill-discipline \u2013 which makes his subsequent dedication even more impressive. He played his first game for Ulster in 2004 and remained loyal to his province for 15 years. Best made his Test debut, coming off the bench, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2005/nov/14/rugbyunion.sport6\" title=\"\">against New Zealand at Lansdowne Road in 2005</a> and the first of many damning comments about him wearing an Ireland shirt appeared in print.</p> <p>Neil Francis, a former international whom he had cheered on as a schoolboy, described how \u201cRory Best waddled on to win his first cap\u201d. Best, who is an amiable man, says: \u201cI was not in very good shape. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time. At that stage it was the greatest day of my rugby life and so to get a former player saying that did hurt.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</strong><br></figcaption> </figure>  <p>Best endured more abuse than most Irish players.

But he still remembers the tweet which said: \u201cNo affence [sic] but how can a fat Protestant like you captain our country, you don\u2019t even sing the anthem?\u201d Best retweeted it while saying: \u201cNone taken. FYI, it is \u2018offence\u2019, not \u2018affance.\u2019 But thanks for your constructive feedback.\u201d</p> <p>Best is surpassed only by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/25/irelands-calling-a-journey-to-the-heart-of-a-rugby-powerhouse-donald-mcrae\" title=\"\">Willie John McBride</a> as an Ireland captain from Ulster. \u201cWillie Anderson was captain for a little bit,\u201d Best points out, \u201cbut, yeah, there hasn\u2019t been too many. I\u2019m very proud of the fact I come from Ulster. And I\u2019m very proud of the fact that the only international team I\u2019ve ever supported is Ireland. So I\u2019m incredibly proud to have captained Ireland. The beauty of the Irish rugby team is that there\u2019s a lot of respect.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5207a8e1337bb37b26646cb1df418bd400c20de8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5207a8e1337bb37b26646cb1df418bd400c20de8/130_183_2966_1780/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rory Best is congratulated on his 100th cap\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rory Best is congratulated on his 100th cap by his teammates after captaining Ireland to victory over Australia in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Mullan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI respect the Irish\u2011speaking element of it. The national anthem. I respect all of that. They respect where I come from. We slag each other for fun but there\u2019s mutual respect. When you look at soccer, Northern Ireland really struggle to get to the major tournaments. So do the Republic. But in rugby, as a combined all-Ireland team, we got to No 1 in the world.\u201d</p> <p>Best also points out that rugby can unify communities \u2013 even if it is played predominantly by middle\u2011class Protestants in Ulster. His dad united Best\u2019s primary school side at Poyntzpass with St Joseph\u2019s, a Catholic school. They formed a cross-community mini-rugby team.</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a big deal in our village,\u201d Best says. \u201cIn terms of the Troubles I remember only one terrible incident in the village. Two best friends, a Protestant and a Catholic, were shot dead. The village still wears the scar to this day.\u201d</p> <p>In March 1998, when Best was 15 and just weeks before the Good Friday agreement was signed, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/feb/03/northernireland.nicholaswatt\" title=\"\">Philip Allen and Damien Trainor were killed</a> while they shared a couple of pints in the pub. Such a tragedy, Best remarks, put his own pain as a rugby player into perspective.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>That sick side of you goes: \u2018What is being said?\u2019 Once you read it, you can\u2019t unread it, much as you wish you could.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Reading his book, it is striking how Best was haunted and then driven by insecurity. \u201cPeople have different ways of motivating themselves. I have a younger sister but I was the youngest of three boys. Simon played Irish Schools, and for Ireland, so he was the rugby one. Mark was a very good rugby player, but he excelled academically. I was like, \u2018What do I excel at?\u2019 You almost develop this chip on your shoulder and it drives you on. That\u2019s where this need to prove myself started. It is doubt. But you almost generate the doubt, to prove them wrong. I used to say in the Irish team room, \u2018I might get dropped this week\u2019, and they\u2019d laugh at me. Whenever you get laughed at in an Irish context, by fellow players, you\u2019re in a good position. But I needed that little push.\u201d</p> <p>In the buildup to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/nov/17/ireland-new-zealand-autumn-international-match-report\" title=\"\">Ireland\u2019s famous defeat of New Zealand</a> in Dublin in 2018 \u2013 beating the All Blacks under Best\u2019s leadership for the second time in three matches, having never tasted victory against them before \u2013 he told his wife he was about to pull on the green shirt for the final time. There had been so much criticism of Best, as being too old and slow, he was certain Schmidt would drop him.</p> <p>\u201cYou allow people to convince you that you\u2019re done,\u201d Best says. \u201cAll I wanted was a win for Ireland and I wondered if they might have a better chance without me. But, deep down, I knew Joe would\u2019ve been the first one to tell me. You say to everyone: \u2018Don\u2019t read the papers.\u2019 But you\u2019ve got well-meaning friends and family. They send the odd text going, \u2018Don\u2019t listen to the papers. We know you can do it.\u2019 Now I\u2019m going to have to look at the papers.

But have they discussed why Ireland lost their way?</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s one of the things that we haven\u2019t talked about,\u201d Best admits. \u201cWhen we spoke it was making sure he understood the headline gave the wrong impression. He was totally fine \u2013 but we haven\u2019t really chatted about the World Cup.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the things the Irish Union could do \u2013 looking ahead to the next World Cup \u2013 is listen to our viewpoints. I have a big regret that, from a captaincy point of view, I didn\u2019t phone Brian O\u2019Driscoll or Paul O\u2019Connell. I played in four World Cups but I didn\u2019t ask Brian what he had learned in 2007 and 2011. If Johnny Sexton\u2019s the captain at the next World Cup that would be one thing you\u2019d encourage him to do \u2013 to ask what we would all do differently as past captains. I think the union has a bit of fear involving recent former players.

  "<p>On Sunday afternoon AFL CEO Gillon McLachlan delivered a hammer blow to the code\u2019s fans across the country \u2013 just one week into the season the country\u2019s biggest sporting competition was suspending, effective immediately.</p> <p>It was a decision that was simultaneously brave and inevitable. As the effects of the global Covid-19 pandemic became increasingly apparent in Australia, state governments moved to action. South and Western Australia joined Tasmania and the territories in closing their borders \u2013 it was a decision that made professional sport not just a logistical nightmare but increasingly an irrelevance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/22/afl-nrl-and-a-league-press-on-despite-restrictions\">AFL suspends season and cancels AFLW amid coronavirus crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>McLachlan\u2019s explanation was clear, his action decisive. But it put rival winter codes on the horn of a dilemma. Given the trans-national nature of its competition, the call to suspend the Super Rugby at the end of last weekend\u2019s matches was unavoidable. But for the NRL and the A-League an already fraught pathway towards lumbering on has become virtually impossible.</p> <p>With an operating surplus last year of $458m, the AFL has something its rival codes simply cannot match: cold, hard, cash. Over the decade just gone, the AFL built revenues from $367m to $794m. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/23/afl-faces-most-serious-threat-in-100-years\">It even amassed a $120m future fund</a>. With clubs dating back over 150 years the foundations of the game are solid.</p> <p>The coronavirus may well prove as McLachlan claimed \u201cthe most serious threat to our game in 100 years\u201d \u2013 the ramifications of the competition\u2019s immediate cancellation for commercial contracts, broadcast deals, club memberships and operational cash flows are utterly mind-boggling.</p> <p>But the mere fact the AFL can make this call means it believes it can endure whatever lies ahead.</p> <p>For Football Federation Australia, the A-League competition is the overwhelming revenue driver for the whole of the game, outside of the four-year national team cycles, hedged against World Cup qualification. Just 15 years old, the league simply doesn\u2019t have the reserves to meet \u201c100 year\u201d threats, especially after club owners accumulated loss-leading deficits of <a href=\"https://books.google.ee/books?id=Yge6CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT58&amp;lpg=PT58&amp;dq=a-league+tumultous+club+owner+losses&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aGElSUa5lo&amp;sig=ACfU3U1Bpf6KYR519gm5iQdM8V9rvPR8nw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwievLLBua7oAhX6IbcAHWQ0DdUQ6AEwAHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=a-league%20tumultous%20club%20owner%20losses&amp;f=false\">between $150m-200m across the competition\u2019s first decade</a>.</p> <p>For new FFA chief executive James Johnson, it\u2019s an unenviable choice: face untold financial losses in immediately suspending the competition or run the risk of earning widespread opprobrium for flaunting public health protocols in the face of a pandemic.</p> <p>That football\u2019s various stakeholders are well aware of the public health ramifications of playing on \u2013 not just to players and staff but to the nation more broadly \u2013 has been acknowledged. The 11th<sup> </sup>hour logistical hoops the game\u2019s administrators have already leapt through over preceding weeks to keep matches taking place has been nothing short of extraordinary.</p> <p>Wellington Phoenix staff and players can already attest to the incredible challenges of having five months in the off-season to plan a campaign, and then suddenly mere weeks in the middle of it to completely redraw flight, accommodation and training plans. With the announcement of border closures in South and Western Australia, Perth Glory and Adelaide United now share their headache.</p> <p>Immediately following McLachlan\u2019s press conference both <a href=\"https://www.a-league.com.au/news/covid-19-impact-20192020-hyundai-a-league-season\">FFA</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.nrl.com/news/2020/03/22/nrl-reaffirms-commitment-to-play-on-as-afl-suspends-competition/\">ARL</a> provided updates regarding their respective codes \u2013 effectively, pending intervention from the government or chief medical officer, games would proceed.</p> <p>The language from NRL\u2019s chairman Peter V\u2019landys has been bullish. Well might rugby league point out it doesn\u2019t have teams in WA or SA, but given the rapid acceleration of Covid-19 infections across Australia day-on-day, events may quickly overrun the code\u2019s eastern coast heartland.</p> <p>For FFA, the hopes of finishing the competition, even under a revised schedule, have effectively evaporated. Whereas even a week ago one or two more rounds of games might have resolved at least the issue of the premiership, Asian Champions League positions, finals spots or the newly introduced FFA Cup 2021 playoff berths for the bottom two clubs will not be resolved. After Monday some teams will have played 20 games, others 23. There\u2019s no clean kill, no curtain to pull down without chalking off the entire season as one big asterisk.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2020/mar/20/david-squires-on-on-the-a-leagues-decision-to-plough-on-through-a-pandemic\">David Squires on ... the A-League ploughing on through a pandemic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The governing body has suggested it will revisit its position on Monday following the federal government\u2019s cabinet meeting on Sunday evening.

It could involve guarantees or concessions from broadcasters and sponsors relating to ongoing contractual commitments, wage freezes or sacrifices from players, or FFA, federal government or club owners underwriting the entire competition.</p> <p>And all of this in a timeframe of days, rather than weeks.

People will be allowed out to shop for food.</p> \n<p>The two Gaza cases are men aged 79 and 63 who returned to Gaza from Pakistan via Egypt at the weekend.

Last Wednesday, it announced the usual change-of-use <a href=\"https://www.bighospitality.co.uk/Article/2020/03/18/Rules-relaxed-so-restaurants-and-pubs-can-become-takeaways\">planning permission</a> for takeaway operations would be waived for 12 months.</p> <p>However, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/food-ordering-safe-ethical-coronavirus-with-seamless-uber-eats-should-i-get-takeaway\">delivery companies</a> enjoying a sudden spike in sales, such as Deliveroo, Just Eat and Uber Eats, have been less helpful. Despite a growing clamour for delivery companies to drop their \u00a3300 to \u00a3500 sign-on fees and cut the <a href=\"https://www.foodandwine.com/fwpro/delivery-apps-restaurants-coronavirus-commission\">commission</a> they charge restaurants on each delivery sale (typically, 25% to 35%), there has been little movement.</p> <p>Current initiatives look more like an attempt to boost revenues and market share for the major delivery companies, rather than genuine help for sinking restaurants. In the US, Uber Eats has waived delivery fees for over <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/uber-eats-waives-delivery-fees-for-independent-restaurants-during-covid-19-pandemic/\">100,000 independents</a> (its UK arm introduced a similar delivery fee cut on Friday, until 31 March). But, primarily, that benefits the customer. Those same restaurants will still have to pay a per-sale commission to Uber Eats which, many restaurateurs argue, slashes their profit margin to almost nothing. \u201cMost of us run at a loss to operate delivery but we do so [for] our loyal customers,\u201d Australian burger chain <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8124621/Milky-Lane-asks-Uber-Eats-Deliveroo-slash-commission-rates-amid-coronavirus.html\">Milky Lane wrote</a> on Facebook, as it pleaded with the delivery brands to slash their post-coronavirus commissions.</p> <p>Instead, in Australia, Uber Eats pledged to spend $AUS5m helping restaurants \u201cdeploy promotions\u201d, presumably on its own app. US services <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/17/doordash-eliminates-and-reduces-some-commission-fees-for-restaurants.html\">DoorDash</a> and Caviar have dropped sign-on fees and offered a 30-day commission holiday, but, like Uber Eats\u2019 waiving of initial fees in Australia and the UK, only for new restaurants. That is a land-grab, not a lifeline. Just Eat\u2019s decision last week to waive sign-on fees for new restaurants, offer independents a 33% rebate on delivery commission charges and temporarily scrap its 14% charge for processing orders for collection is marginally better. But it is limited for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/19/just-eat-cuts-its-take-for-30-days-to-help-restaurants-during-the-covid-19-crisis/\">30 days</a>.

That market, restaurateurs grumble, is not new. They built it. Delivery firms were stealing it from under them slowly and surely by dissuading more and more people from eating out. Worse, while it may have benefited a few specific styles of restaurant, the delivery companies have created a distribution channel which most restaurants cannot ignore, but which many claim they cannot make a viable profit margin from. \u201cIt\u2019s horseshit,\u201d US restaurateurs told Food &amp; Wine. \u201cIt\u2019s highway robbery.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/coronavirus-has-exposed-a-desperate-need-for-localism\">Coronavirus has exposed a desperate need for localism | Simon Jenkins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Growing fast but struggling to turn a profit (in 2018, Deliveroo lost <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/02/deliveroo-makes-232m-loss-despite-doubling-its-operation\">\u00a3232m</a>), delivery brands may see coronavirus as an opportunity to embed themselves in our lives, making home delivery a universal habit.

More than 2,700 people were allowed to disembark from the Ruby Princess at Sydney\u2019s Circular Quay, despite more than 150 cases of illness being logged onboard. The Ruby Princess now accounts for 26 confirmed cases of Covid-19. </p> \n  <p>The statement appears to, at times, shift the blame to the federal government.

Here it is in full:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>NSW assessments on cruise ships entering our ports has exceeded Federal Government protocols and was doing so, well in advance of the National Protocol*, that was issued on March 6 2020.</p> \n   <p>Notwithstanding that, the Federal Government has not increased any protocol procedures relating to cruise ships since March 6.</p> \n   <p>Today, the NSW Government further enhanced its procedures to minimise the risk of passengers with any respiratory conditions whatsoever from departing cruise ships until COVID-19 tests can be carried out on onshore laboratories.</p> \n   <p>Since February 14, NSW Health has applied assessment procedures to all 63 ships entering Sydney Harbour. The National Protocol does not direct jurisdictions to do such assessments but instead, leave it to the State\u2019s discretion.</p> \n   <p>Contrary to some public statements made, every cruise liner that has entered NSW ports has been the subject of an assessment well beyond Federal requirements.</p> \n   <p>The National Protocol states \u201cprovided there are no concerns about the COVID-19 risk profile of a ship or suspected COVID-19 cases reported, the human bio-security officer may advise the bio-security officer that pratique can be granted and the ship may be allowed to continue the voyage while samples are being tested\u201d.</p> \n   <p>NSW Health undertook a full assessment of the Ruby Princess, notwithstanding under the National Protocol in place, it could have chosen not to do an assessment.</p> \n   <p>NSW Health again followed the National Protocol that states \u201cthe ship may be allowed to continue the voyage while samples are being tested\u201d.</p> \n   <p>However, as of midnight March 22, NSW Health will go even further beyond the National Protocol and its current own State protocols and will hold all cruise ships in port until any patients highlighted as having respiratory issues are tested for COVID-19.</p> \n   <p>The increased testing regime follows 26 confirmed cases of COVID-19 from the Ruby Princess, including 17 passengers and 1 crew member diagnosed in NSW, and 8 passengers diagnosed interstate (as of 8 pm yesterday).</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-22T08:03:05.716Z\">at 8.03am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7717978f08e0999e6b7e97\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-22T07:49:13.922Z\">7.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Carlton and United Breweries, the company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/dec/07/cub-55-workers-have-won-all-demands-in-industrial-dispute-says-union\">whose mistreatment of 55 workers</a> prompted national outrage in 2016, says it is <strong>concerned about brewery jobs</strong> after the Victorian government announced its shutdown of non-essential industries. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/rwillingham/status/1241628263107051520\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Carlton and United Breweries are worried about brewery jobs and beer supplies. \u2066<a href=\"https://twitter.com/abcmelbourne?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@abcmelbourne</a>\u2069 <a href=\"https://t.co/69gJxiWQvb\">pic.twitter.com/69gJxiWQvb</a></p>\u2014 Richard Willingham (@rwillingham) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rwillingham/status/1241628263107051520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 22, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7710948f08a08573fbf303\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-22T07:30:28.308Z\">7.30am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">ACT says schools will be 'pupil free' from Tuesday</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Just back to the ACT momentarily, the government has also announced it <strong>will be shifting rapidly to online learning in schools</strong>.

The SA police commissioner will also declare a major emergency in that state \u2014 that replaces the public health emergency that was previously declared, and means that emergency provisions are authorised under the Emergency Management Act and not the Public Health Act. </p> \n  <p>Police are responsible for enforcing that act, so the emergency management response will now be coordinated by the police commissioner. This is similar to what Tasmania announced on Thursday.</p> \n  <p>Marshall said the measure was announced after<strong> a number of cases in SA in recent days were of people who had contracted the virus after returning from interstate, or contracted it from people visiting from interstate.</strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This has forced our decision to close our borders in South Australia. We make this decision in the interest of public health in South Australia. <strong>People that are coming into South Australia, whether they are visitors or whether they are South Australians returning, will be required to undertake 14 days of self isolation.</strong> This is no longer something which is optional. It is mandatory. It is the social responsibility of every single person in this state to make sure that they are abiding by these rules. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The laws will come into force on 4pm on Tuesday. Border control stations will be set up at the airport, at train stations, and on roads entering SA \u2014 repurposing heavy vehicle inspections stations and biosecurity stations that already exist on the border.</p> \n  <p>Marshall said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When people come into South Australia, from four o\u2019clock onTuesday afternoon, they will be required to understand precisely the orders that will be in place. <strong>They will be asked to sign a declaration that they will self isolate and they will be required to provide SA Police with information on where they will be undertaking their self isolation</strong>. There will be tests on this important declaration and this commitment individuals regarding this very, very important Public safety initiative. </p> \n   <p>There will be some arrangements put in place along borders because we know that in country South Australia, sometimes two towns on either side of the border have a high level of interaction ... People that do live in those communities will be allowed to move between those communities once they have been identified as somebody in on of those communities but, I stress, if there is any reason to believe that there is an outbreak on the immediate other side of the border, then that\u2019ll have to also be curtailed.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Marshall said there would be some \u201clogical exceptions\u201d to the quarantine requirements, particularly around freight.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-22T03:38:01.470Z\">at 3.38am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e76d8078f08a08573fbf24c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-22T03:17:00.864Z\">3.17am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">NSW premier says she will introduce a 'more comprehensive' lockdown of non-essential services</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here is the full statement from the NSW premier, <strong>Gladys Berejiklian</strong>, on a \u201cmore comprehensive lockdown of non-essential services\u201d in NSW.<br></p> \n  <p>The statement reads:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p><em>Tonight I will be informing the National Cabinet that NSW will proceed to a <strong>more comprehensive shutdown of non-essential services.

The rate for a single person with no children will now be <strong>$1,115.70 a fortnight</strong>. </p> \n  <p>That will be accomplished with a <strong>massive $550 per fortnight top-up payment </strong>to everyone on JobSeeker Payment.

What this means is, while your dole payments will be <a href=\"https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/services/centrelink/jobseeker-payment/how-much-you-can-get/income-and-asset-limits\">tapered according to your earnings</a>, as long as don\u2019t earn $1,100 in a fortnight (which means you lose your payments all together), you will still get the full $550 supplement.</p> \n  <p>This will be crucial for casual workers and sole-traders, the government says. </p> \n  <p>The government is also waiving the liquid assets waiting test, meaning people will not have to whittle down their savings before accessing Jobseeker Payment.</p> \n  <p>People on <strong>Youth Allowance JobSeeker, Parenting Payment, Farm Household Allowance and Special Benefit</strong> will also get this $550 fortnightly top-up payment.</p> \n  <p>Notably, disability support pensioners (who currently receive a maximum rate of $944 a fortnight) do not appear to be eligible for the extra payment, according to the press release. </p> \n  <p>On top of the temporary boost to income support payments, there is also an <strong>extra $750 stimulus payment from 13 July 2020 to around 5 million welfare recipients</strong>, veterans and eligible concession card holders.

  "<p>Much has been written about Britons who fought in Syria, but little truly explains who these characters were, what made them tick. Or what actually happened when they disappeared into the byzantine politics of its brutal war. <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/no-return-9781783351817.html\">No Return</a></em> tracks five teenage friends from Brighton who stepped into its chaos. All were killed except one. The survivor, Amer Deghayes, is the longest-serving Briton in Syria since the fighting began and offers a unique account of a ceaseless, shifting conflict.</p> <p>Equally crucial are those he left behind. I learned that more than 30 Brightonians \u2013 the largest identified group of potential jihadists in western Europe \u2013 had discussed plans to join him. All were between 13 and 18 years of age, some were girls, most were white, working-class Islamic converts from the forgotten estates of east Brighton.</p> <p>Investigating what had happened to these youngsters I discovered the Hillstreet Gang (HSG), whose members had converted to Islam in a makeshift gym. For several years the police considered them the most notorious street gang in Brighton. A hidden, violent side of the city revealed itself.</p> <p>Throughout the summer of 2018 I tracked down prominent members one by one, knowing that approaching the group would mean instant rejection.</p> <p>But like their friends who had disappeared in Syria, key figures would vanish from Brighton, often into prison. One central member of HSG who appears in <em>No Return</em> was jailed for 20 years, so I didn\u2019t get the chance to interview him.</p> <p>Soon after another of the book\u2019s key figures, Amer\u2019s brother Abdul, was killed in an alleged drugs dispute.</p> <p>It was a death as sudden and savage as that of his friends who had entered Syria. But Abdul\u2019s vulnerability, like the others, had been signposted long before, raising questions over how we view those seen as different. Do we try to understand or do we push them further to the margins, deeper into violence?</p> <h2>Extract from No Return: The True Story of How Martyrs Are Made</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0cfd197262e7334d214b8f264d77edfacb030532\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0cfd197262e7334d214b8f264d77edfacb030532/0_0_3500_2329/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Saltdean in Brighton, East Sussex.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saltdean in Brighton, East Sussex.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Hasson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was calm on Saltdean beach, the hum of the A259 drowned out by the surf. As a young teenager, Amer Deghayes would come here for peace and stand up to his ankles in the water, peering into the sea.</p> <p>Peace was a fleeting concept when you lived with four younger brothers. The nearest in age to Amer were twins Abdullah and Abdul. Next came Jaffar. Mohammed, the youngest, was the quietest. Accompanying them would be their mother Einas, a timid woman whose parental strategy was geared towards kindness with as little confrontation as possible. Her husband, Abubaker, was a thickset alpha male with a prayer bump on his forehead that proved his piety.</p> <p>Amer was named after Abubaker\u2019s father, Amer Taher Deghayes, a lawyer who had pioneered trade unions in Libya, and decades later remained a celebrated figure among a slice of the country\u2019s liberal intelligentsia. He was also co-founder of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Ba%27ath_Movement\">Ba\u2019ath movement</a> that challenged Libya\u2019s leader Muammar Gaddafi for power. It was a perilous, courageous move. And one that meant Amer never met his grandfather. Amer senior was arrested by Gaddafi\u2019s security officials 14 years before his grandson was born, and died in custody. Amnesty International said he was \u201cbelieved to have been extra-judicially executed\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d1e552b61be22e47109437b29494cd729db1d9f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1e552b61be22e47109437b29494cd729db1d9f8/0_0_750_829/452.jpg\" alt=\"Amer Deghayes.\" width=\"452\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amer Deghayes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Stewart News Limited</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The family fled to the UK and claimed political asylum. They bought a house in the Sussex village of Saltdean, a conservative place of net curtains and neat flowerbeds a short walk from the beach. They were its only Muslim family. Abubaker studied business at Lewes College, ran an old people\u2019s home and married his cousin, Einas Abulsayen.</p> <p>Abubaker\u2019s brother Omar, inspired by their father, became a lawyer with ambitions to represent the oppressed. After graduating in law from the University of Wolverhampton, Omar, 31, travelled to Afghanistan on a round-the-world trip to experience Islamic cultures. There he was embroiled in the US invasion that followed the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. Captured by mercenaries and sold for a reported $5,000 to US intelligence, he was deported to Guantanamo Bay in a case of mistaken identity, confused with a Saudi jihadist who was later killed by Russian forces.</p> <p>Omar spent almost 2,000 days inside the gulag, where he was tortured and lost the sight of one eye. By the time he returned to Brighton in 2007 his wife, whom he had met on his travels, had divorced him. He had lost everything.</p> <p>Abubaker, who devoted years to getting his brother released, and remained traumatised by the loss of his father, was a figure who corroborated the thesis that violence flows down generations. Einas felt her husband had unaddressed mental health issues. Whatever the truth, documents from police and social services suggested that for years the family privately endured his volatile temper.</p> <p>Things came to a head in November 2010 when the emergency helpline of a local charity for victims of domestic abuse received a call from a friend of Einas, gravely concerned for her safety and that of her five sons. In detail, the caller recounted how Abubaker had that weekend become \u201cvery physically aggressive, smashing up mobile phones and other items. Family had to lock themselves in one room and call the police,\u201d stated a summary of the call.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"498ac3e637e5738db57c9833680ce2e650a2bc6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/498ac3e637e5738db57c9833680ce2e650a2bc6f/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Omar Deghayes, who was held in Guantanamo Bay for more than five years and subjected to torture that left him blind in his right eye.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Omar Deghayes, who was held in Guantanamo Bay for more than five years and subjected to torture that left him blind in his right eye.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Teri Pengilley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Three days later police received another call; the details were macabre. Amer and the others were allegedly lined up and \u201cwhipped with electrical leads or computer cables\u201d by their father, who contests the claims against him.</p> <p>In light of these allegations, the five boys received a child protection order forbidding Abubaker contacting them. But their troubles were far from over. At Longhill school the four younger boys were subjected to racist comments and bullying. The attacks were daily, merciless and unrelenting. Water was lobbed over the twins as they queued for lunch in the canteen. Bread buns were hurled at them as they ate. Taunts of \u201cPaki\u201d and \u201cterrorist\u201d followed them around the playground. They were cornered and beaten on the school bus back to Saltdean.</p> <p>Even when they made it to home turf, there was no respite. Anti-Islamic graffiti began appearing on the quaint seafront promenade, 200 metres from the family home. Adjacent to their house lay Saltdean Oval, the park where the Deghayes boys played football on summer evenings. It was their favourite pastime, until the bullies from Longhill began targeting them there. They stopped playing football, a decision that upset all the brothers. At night, their attackers would mass at the Oval and creep up the hill towards their home where they would stand in the small front garden, shouting obscenities, the familiar favourites of \u201cPaki\u201d and \u201cterrorist\u201d. Bricks would hit the house. Some of the gang would start kicking the front door. When they grew bored, they would leave. Then the family would quietly shuffle to bed, too petrified to venture downstairs.</p> <p>According to local activists, police gave the impression they were happy to abandon the family. The twins in particular felt the police did not respond to the racism and that reports of harassment and antisocial behaviour against them were not investigated, according to one of their case workers. Behind Brighton\u2019s progressive image of green politics, veganism and tolerance was a competing, ugly reality.</p> <p>During the spring term of 2010 the twins made a pact that the bullies wouldn\u2019t win. They installed boxing equipment in their parents\u2019 Saltdean garage and spent hours pummelling punchbags they pretended were the torsos of their adversaries. They worked out every night, buoyed when their arms and necks started to thicken.</p> <p>Their transformation from bullied children to ringleaders was rapid. Those present at the Deghayeses\u2019 third child protection conference in mid-July 2011 were startled. Though the meeting had been convened to determine if the boys were safe from their father, it became evident that the tables were turned. Officials were alarmed by the speed of the power shift. \u201cThe five boys would now take on their father and not be abused by him. They have become both a powerful group in the community and in the family home,\u201d their assessment concluded.</p> <p>Over the next couple of years, while Amer remained a diligent student, Abdullah, Abdul and Jaffar were routinely excluded from school. The twins enrolled others who were ostracised from mainstream education and formed the Hillstreet Gang, which Jaffar also joined. HSG quickly became notorious for violence, dealing weed and troublemaking throughout the city, resulting in a blanket ban for all members from most of the city\u2019s shops, bars and public spaces in May 2012.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7060a83f8cc155371f4f8dcabd49f22c4eba9964\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7060a83f8cc155371f4f8dcabd49f22c4eba9964/0_0_306_435/306.jpg\" alt=\"Jaffar Deghayes.\" width=\"306\" height=\"435\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jaffar Deghayes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: internet</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Around this time Amer set up a rudimentary gym at the al-Quds mosque, where Abubaker had just become a trustee. And, in part because their reputation meant no other gym in the city allowed them entry, HSG joined a cohort of teenagers who were gathering there daily</p> <p>The police monitoring the Deghayeses and others viewed the popularity of the mosque gym \u2013 dubbed the Brothers\u2019 Gym by the gang \u2013 as an unequivocally positive development. Jaffar\u2019s attendance at the mosque had, after all, coincided with an abrupt fall in his offending.</p> <p>Amer, who was now commuting daily to London\u2019s Oxford Street to a job in Specsavers, was delighted that so many of his brothers\u2019 friends were turning to Islam. The converts learned how to prostrate themselves, kneeling with their foreheads pointing towards Mecca. They were taught Arabic phrases, such as \u201c<em>As-Salaam-Alaikum</em>\u201d, meaning \u201cPeace be unto you\u201d.</p> <p>Twelve months previously the twins had seldom identified as Muslims; now Islam became the gang\u2019s identity. By March 2013 at least 20 of the group called themselves Muslim. For many in the gang it was the first belief system they had.</p> <p>But the largely positive energy inside the gym was about to change. The group often watched videos on their phones and a film about the Syrian civil war had electrified Amer. A German film-maker had spent weeks inside Aleppo, documenting its civilian population under siege.</p> <p>Screened on <em>Channel 4 News </em>on 25 March 2013, it followed a group of exhausted kids working in a makeshift hospital. They attempted to keep other children, pale and bloodied, from death. One boy was no more than 12, a doctor\u2019s coat drowning his frame. He had an 11-year-old friend, Yusef, who helped him tend to the wounded. The film closed with Yusef lying dead, open-mouthed, in the place where he once helped others. He had been killed by a Syrian army bomb.</p> <p>Amer was overcome with a sensation that felt unusual: rage. Others were asking how Bashar al-Assad could get away with killing his own people, the country\u2019s children. Even the twins, preoccupied with their own combat zone on the streets of Brighton, railed against Assad.</p> <p>Something else in the Channel 4 film caught Amer\u2019s eye. Standing against Assad in the absence of western intervention was an Islamist group called Jabhat al-Nusra. The programme followed them handing out food and clothing to Aleppo\u2019s stranded civilians, giving spiritual guidance, relaxing after a firefight by playing <em>Fifa</em>. Amer began investigating al-Nusra, watching grainy footage of men carrying AK-47s marching behind tanks and shouting <em>Allahu-Akbar </em>after every victory.</p> <p>March had been the bloodiest month of the Syrian war with 6,000 deaths. Amer said it was obvious the <em>ummah </em>\u2013 the community of Muslims \u2013 needed defending. He said that every Muslim in the group, including the converts, had a duty. The gang agreed there was a need to fight back. One Islamic concept was starting to appeal: jihad.</p> <p>Over the summer he spent hours studying the cleric <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/anwar-al-awlaki\">Anwar al-Awlaki</a>, who two years earlier had been killed in a US drone strike in Yemen\u2019s tribal badlands. Al-Awlaki lived on in more than 70,000 YouTube videos, and part of his potency was that he preached in English. With no Arabic required, just internet access, it gave him enormous reach to Muslims in the west \u2013 and all those in the Brothers\u2019 Gym.</p> <p>In one video, shot in Yemen in 2010, Awlaki warned: \u201cThe west will eventually turn against its Muslim citizens.\u201d The horrific experiences of Omar in Guantanamo Bay were familiar to everyone in HSG. They all knew what was possible.</p> <p>On 29 August 2013 the British parliament rejected a plan for military strikes against Assad. Then Barack Obama asked Congress to postpone a vote to authorise a US military strike on Syria. It seemed clear to the Brothers\u2019 Gym that doing something was the only option. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be the person just standing on the sideline and watching,\u201d said Amer. He knew what his grandfather would have done.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Each day, more refugees arrived, all with fresher, more brutish accounts of Assad\u2019s men</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Amer\u2019s father had maintained connections with the Muslim humanitarian sector since the Bosnian war. One charity was called the Albayan Foundation, based in the predominantly Muslim area of Sparkhill, Birmingham. The organisation had been among the first to deliver aid to Syria after the conflict began two years earlier. Albayan\u2019s next convoy would be heading for Syria soon, in less than a month. Amer told his father that he needed to help Syria\u2019s beleaguered civilians. His schoolfriend, Mo Khan, was also keen to come along for the ride.</p> <p>On the eve of their departure, Amer told his mum that he was going to Libya to see relatives and she let him have his passport. Mid-afternoon the next day, 8 October 2013, two white lorries that had travelled from Birmingham picked him and Mo Khan up, along with Abubaker, sucking a Rothmans cigarette.</p> <p>Two hours later they reached Calais and from there headed south-west into Germany. After six days and 3,000 miles they reached the Turkish border. On 14 October, the two white lorries entered Syria via the Bab al-Hawa crossing.</p> <p>Close up, the Atmeh refugee camp was wretched. Recent rains had ravaged the site and its paths had become quagmires. Amer watched families struggling uphill, slipping in mud mixed with excrement. The camp\u2019s 25,000 occupants had been forgotten. Winter approached, but it had no running water, no electricity, no heat, no sewage systems and no UN relief convoys. Each day, more refugees arrived, all with fresher, more brutish accounts of Assad\u2019s men.</p> <p>Armed men, AK-47s slung over their shoulders, could be spotted outside the camp. The refugees called them \u201cthe spicy crew\u201d. They were the jihadists, Jabhat al-Nusra. The surrounding hills belonged to them. From Atmeh, Amer could see their black banners, trembling in the breeze. Amer and Mo Khan planned to join them. But the charity workers wouldn\u2019t let them out of their sight. After a week, their tasks almost done, they were no closer to becoming jihadists. Finally, the Birmingham charity workers said they were finished. They were all going home. Reluctantly, Amer and Mo helped pack up and climbed in a van. On 22 October they left Syria.</p> <p>As they drove towards Turkey\u2019s Hatay airport, Amer and Mo Khan hatched a yarn about flying to Libya to see Amer\u2019s family. Outside the departure terminal they said goodbye to the charity drivers and watched them trundle off in the direction of Birmingham. The instant they disappeared Amer and Mo turned towards the taxi rank. \u201cThe border please,\u201d said Amer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b84676f83ec61bf7ab3dd99cfbab6c36d78729e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b84676f83ec61bf7ab3dd99cfbab6c36d78729e6/0_0_2499_1666/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Cilvegozu border crossing between Turkey and Syria.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Cilvegozu border crossing between Turkey and Syria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adem Altan/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Crossing the border was effortless as it was controlled by Jabhat al-Nusra. Amer and Mo Khan simply told the border guards they wanted to join the jihad against Assad. They were escorted to a truck and taken south to an al-Nusra training camp.</p> <p>The camp was highly professional. Not only were there huge stockpiles of weaponry, but massive reserves of manpower. Foreign fighters were flooding in from across Europe, most arriving via humanitarian convoys.</p> <p>Training began with a dawn prayer and an hour run led by a Chechen special forces officer. Then it was tactical tutorials, ambush training and simulated attacks, followed by prayers and lectures by Islamist teachers. Amer and Mo learned basic firing techniques and assault tactics, how to clean a rifle, tie a tourniquet and clean a deep flesh wound. In two weeks, they learned how to be jihadists.</p> <p>Back in Sussex, on the morning of 11 November, a meeting of senior police, counter-extremism chiefs, youth justice bosses and representatives from Prevent gathered to ascertain if Jaffar was at risk of being radicalised following a recent diatribe he had made in public about Americans being terrorists. During the meeting, the family\u2019s former social worker revealed that Jaffar\u2019s oldest brother, Amer, was now in Syria. The revelation prompted little urgency. Not a single expert at the meeting believed the 16-year-old was vulnerable. \u201cThere are no risks of radicalisation,\u201d was the final, unanimous verdict.</p> <p>Had they taken even a cursory look at his phone, they would have quickly learned that Jaffar was in frequent touch with his 19-year-old brother. From there, they would have rapidly discovered that Jaffar and a large number of his friends were discussing travelling to Syria.</p> <p>At the start of 2014 there was a major Brothers\u2019 Gym meeting to discuss who was prepared to make the journey. Jaffar was driving the plan. His friend Ibby had already put his name down and Abdullah decided to go too. Like Jaffar, Abdullah felt he had run out of rope in Brighton. \u201cThey were thinking that they couldn\u2019t do anything with their lives, there was no point in staying, that they couldn\u2019t get a job,\u201d said Abdullah\u2019s friend Bill.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8310a9e33f59692ff9352f4c0853fe4a3bc077ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8310a9e33f59692ff9352f4c0853fe4a3bc077ae/0_0_1390_1357/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jaffar Deghayes\u2019s friend Ibby Kamara.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"976\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jaffar Deghayes\u2019s friend Ibby Kamara.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: internet</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They bought three one-way \u00a359 tickets to Istanbul, sitting together. They half-expected to be raided by police in the hours following the transaction. Nothing happened.</p> <p>The security staff on duty at Luton on 28 January 2014 could not have missed the three teenagers; the towering pipe-cleaner figure of Ibby framed by the squat physiques of Jaffar and Abdullah. Everything was against them. Ibby was carrying the passport of his 15-year-old brother, a person who looked nothing like him and who was not allowed to fly without an authorised adult. Jaffar was on an extremist airport watchlist. Abdullah, 17, one of the most notorious faces in his force area, was not only on bail but due in court in several weeks. Police also had intelligence that Abdullah and Jaffar\u2019s eldest brother was currently fighting for an al-Qaida-affiliated group in Syria. Finally, they had bought one-way tickets, at a stroke compromising their cover story of a sightseeing trip to Istanbul. A rookie mistake.</p> <p>Shortly after 2pm they checked in and approached passport control. They waltzed through. It was the same story at Istanbul Atat\u00fcrk airport. As the number one arrival point for foreign fighters headed for Syria in early 2014, the airport\u2019s border officials had received instruction to profile Muslims arriving from the west \u2013 especially those with no return tickets. But the three teenagers from Brighton skipped through security without a hitch.</p> <p>They could never have envisaged how straightforward it would be to enter Syria. Jabhat al-Nusra had seized control of the crossing six weeks earlier and the three boys, including the youngest British jihadist who would enter the Syrian conflict, were almost dragged over by the welcoming guards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"71c8f0f42db75f373142da3635b7b7a60acf2cdd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71c8f0f42db75f373142da3635b7b7a60acf2cdd/0_0_3508_4000/877.jpg\" alt=\"Abdullah Deghayes.\" width=\"877\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abdullah Deghayes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Family handout/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On 5 April 2014, Abdul and Abdullah spent their 18th birthdays three time zones apart. For Abdul it was a fairly low-key day at the mosque gym. Abdullah celebrated his arrival to adulthood at the frontline of the al-Nusra offensive, occupying a trench south of the village of Salma in Syria\u2019s Latakia province. Most of the rebel fighters were weary and cold; supply lines were stretched. Syrian artillery had started shelling their positions, but Abdullah had boundless energy. The more they were targeted, the more he seemed invigorated.</p> <p>Over the days that followed the fighting intensified. At least 40 foreign recruits died. The Brighton contingent found themselves three-quarters up Mount Chalma. Their unit commander took them aside. A force of enemy troops had gathered on the other side of the mountain. \u201cHe just said: \u2018Let\u2019s go around the army and surround them\u2019,\u201d said Amer. They set off, the Mediterranean glittering below them in the late afternoon sun.</p> <p>A ferocious burst of firing erupted from a line of trees just ahead. The al-Nusra fighters crouched as the weight of fire intensified. To his left, Amer noticed a figure moving ahead, Abdullah, out on his own, chasing the regime troops down the scree of the steep mountainside. He could hear his younger brother shouting, pursuing the enemy like he once chased rival gangs along Marine Parade. Then Amer heard a sharp crack, a sniper rifle. He watched his younger brother tumble heavily to the ground. By the time they reached him, it was too late. Abdullah Deghayes was dead. He was 18 years and six days old.</p> <p>Einas was the first to receive the news. She initially refused to believe it. Soon after, an image surfaced on Facebook. Shot at dusk and taken from the chest up, it showed Abdullah lying on his back in a combat jacket. He looked serene, as if he was sleeping. Abdul and Mohammed, who had been lugging the belongings of their three brothers in Syria into their new temporary council home in Portslade, heard their mum\u2019s wailing. Abdul broke down uncontrollably when he learned his twin was dead.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What made me angry was that nothing was done about it. My son was just another dead jihadi. They let them go to die</p> <footer> <cite>Khadijah Kamara</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Within six months another brother and two friends were also dead. Mo Khan had been killed by a Russian explosive, Ibby by an American cruise missile, and Jaffar by Syrian army regulars. His body was never found.</p> <p>Ibby\u2019s mother, Khadijah Kamara, wrote to the Home Office asking why her eldest boy had been allowed to travel using not just the wrong passport but that of a 15-year-old. \u201cAs a mother I feel that I am owed an explanation,\u201d she wrote. But no explanation was forthcoming. \u201cWhat made me angry was that nothing was done about it. My son was just another dead jihadi. They let them go to die.\u201d</p> <p>The city put a lid on the case, hoping that no one would pry too closely. Within the council and police, the fact that the scale and scope of the extremism had not been exposed was a source of relief. Rather than drilling down into the issues \u2013 the injustices and ignorance that caused the problem \u2013 officials walked away, keen to move on.</p> <p>Abubaker\u2019s temper landed him in trouble again. In the summer of 2018 he faced trial for assaulting his wife. He was found not guilty of assault, but sentenced to 18 months in prison for attempting to prevent Einas testifying against him. Abubaker joined his youngest son in jail. Four months earlier Mohammed had been sentenced at Lewes crown court. The court heard that he was caught in a catch-22. The teenager was trapped in a cycle of dealing to repay the debts he had accrued by using drugs as \u201ca much-needed escape from everything going on around him\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Abdul, the twin who had stayed at home, is alleged to have<strong> </strong>evolved into a serious criminal, with a string of convictions for violence, robbery and drug-dealing. In September 2017, he was jailed after police raided the home where he lived with his mother and found scales, deal bags, burner phones, wads of cash, even a safe. And a lot of drugs: cocaine, ketamine, MDMA and amphetamines with a combined street value of \u00a32,250.</p> <p>Amer spoke to him from Syria shortly after he was set free the following summer. Abdul sounded contrite, almost remorseful. He promised his older brother he had changed his ways. But the 22-year-old, who had come so close to travelling to fight in Syria, embraced the only life he knew. He fell back into leading Hillstreet.</p> <p>In February 2019, Abdul is said to have met up with a cocaine dealer known as Frank. What happened next is the subject of a murder trial. Abdul was stabbed eight times. A knife sank nine centimetres into his body, skewering a kidney and slicing the femoral vein and artery in his left leg, a grievous wound. For eight hours doctors at the Royal Sussex county hospital fought to save Abdul. But at 6am, the sky still black, specialists agreed his injuries were \u201cuntreatable\u201d. Abdul Deghayes was dead.</p> <p>His brother Mohammed was allowed out of prison to attend Abdul\u2019s funeral. Abubaker addressed the mourners. His son was venerated, he said, recounting his recent spell in prison when he was afforded hero status by so many inmates because he was \u201cAbdul\u2019s dad\u201d. But Abubaker\u2019s central message was that Abdul\u2019s death must act as the catalyst for his friends to mend their ways. \u201cIt\u2019s time to turn the corner,\u201d said the 50-year-old and stared at the gang. Some lowered their heads. And he said that it was time to go clean. \u201cNo more intoxication, no more getting high. It\u2019s time to chase the super-high of Islam.\u201d Then he pleaded for calm, no more bloodshed. \u201cPlease no revenge, no retribution. In Islam we show peace to everyone, wherever they are. Wherever they come from,\u201d said Abubaker.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2fd0ebfedd454bd7ff0867486c539b4f510eb8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2fd0ebfedd454bd7ff0867486c539b4f510eb8b/0_0_5066_3379/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abubaker Deghayes at home in Saltdean, Sussex, April 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abubaker Deghayes at home in Saltdean, East Sussex, April 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Einas, who had now lost three of her sons, kept a low profile in Saltdean, living in a quiet street close to where the family first arrived in the UK. Occasionally friends saw her in the city, always meticulous in her hijab, but she was shy, leaving most to speculate how she coped with what had happened to her five boys.</p> <p>Six years on, Amer is the only one of the five to remain in Syria. Having arrived fresh-faced in the autumn of 2013 with the aim of toppling Assad, the 25-year-old had not imagined he would still be there. After the death of Jaffar, Abdullah and Mo Khan, he sought refuge in family life. He had married Natalie, a Syrian national, in 2015, and they had a daughter, Sham. They moved to a modest home in an Idlib suburb whose roads were lined with rubble and pock-marked with craters. Nearby was a gym and mosque and he had friends, including six British jihadists. Mostly, he enjoyed spending time with his wife, watching CBeebies on YouTube with his daughter.</p> <p>But the defeat at Aleppo had dramatically curbed the ambitions of the jihadists. Shoehorned into a sliver of land in the north-west, all their hope of an Islamic emirate had faded. The only good news, said Amer, was that Islamic State were finally routed.</p> <p>He had started contemplating his future and towards the end of 2019 he was sounding different in his calls home. Once he described himself as \u201cbeaten\u201d and he began feeling homesick. He wanted his family to meet Sham and Natalie. He missed the sea, the squawk of seagulls.</p> <p>But the issue of Syrian returnees following the defeat of the Islamic State had turned toxic. Ministers threatened severe consequences for anyone attempting to return from Syria. In May 2019 the then home secretary, Sajid Javid, gave British citizens in Idlib province an ultimatum: leave within 28 days or face a 10-year prison sentence if they attempted to return to the UK.</p> <p>Amer was worried, fearful of what it meant for him and his family. He occasionally wondered what the UK security services thought of him. But it was the answer to another question that he most wanted.</p> <p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019ll be OK to come home?\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>This is an edited extract from <em>No Return: The True Story of How Martyrs Are Made</em> by Mark Townsend (Guardian Faber, \u00a312.99).

  "<p>On a chilly afternoon in Glasgow, Willy sits crossed-legged on the floor, his hands tucked into the sleeves of his hoodie. The normally bustling city centre is virtually deserted, the small plastic tub at his feet is empty.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one around, so it\u2019s hard,\u201d he says. \u201cIt just means that I cannae get nothing to eat.\u201d</p> <p>The 42-year-old has been sleeping rough for the last four years, on and off. And despite nationwide efforts to get street sleepers into accommodation, he still doesn\u2019t have a roof over his head.</p> <p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m scared, I\u2019m very scared,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there\u2019s nothing I can do. You need a house to self-isolate or a roof over your head. I\u2019m just going to keep myself healthy as much as I can.\u201d</p> <p>Charities and local authorities are racing against the clock to secure enough accommodation for the UK\u2019s homeless population to be able to self-isolate, with many winter night shelters set to close at the end of the month.</p> <p>But while many rough sleepers have been accommodated thanks to a government \u00a33.2m <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/3-2-million-emergency-support-for-rough-sleepers-during-coronavirus-outbreak\">emergency fund</a>, others remain on the streets and are seeing the services they rely on stripped back as staff are forced to self-isolate, volunteers forced to stay home and public gatherings banned.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.org.uk/\">Glass Door</a> in London has stopped accepting new people into its night shelters, and reduced its dinner service to prevent overcrowding. As the supply of food and volunteers diminishes, the charity is considering distributing mobile phones with credit to continue to provide support.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen some housing providers stop taking new referrals, and others report that they are struggling to access new accommodation,\u201d says senior caseworker Neil Parkinson. \u201cAt the same time, guests who had managed to get jobs have found themselves back out of work. We are also finding that the wait time on the call to book a first appointment for a new Universal Credit claim has gone from about 10 minutes to two hours.\u201d</p> <p>The government is expected to announce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/21/uk-hotels-homeless-shelters-coronavirus\">plans to convert hotels and offices</a> into safe units under a national action plan imminently \u2013 but many charities say securing the estimated 45,000 units needed is an uphill task.</p> <p>Terry Gore at Catching Lives Day Centre in Canterbury says the charity has been told to contact the council for alternative accommodation only if clients are showing signs of the virus. \u201cMy hope is that accommodation will be made available to allow our rough sleepers to get off the street and self-isolate \u2013 but there is no sign of that at the moment,\u201d he says. Instead the charity is supporting people on the streets, buying water bottles, cheap mobiles, pay as you go sim cards, power banks, and delivering food parcels.</p> <p>The sector is facing \u201ca perfect storm\u201d, says Mark Grant at <a href=\"https://actionhomeless.org.uk/\">Action Homeless in Leicester</a>. \u201cIn the last couple of days we\u2019ve been working with the council, trying to identify accommodation, negotiating with some hotels on cost, seeing where we can move people into their own flats. But there is very little capacity anywhere. The housing system was already under pressure \u2013 there just aren\u2019t spare hostels and houses.\u201d</p> <p>The decision about who needs to self-isolate is further complicated by a lack of testing among a population who regularly present with coughs and fever. \u201cWe\u2019re operating blind,\u201d says Grant.</p> <p>People are already falling between the cracks. Glass Door in London reported sending a guest with symptoms to hospital for them to be sent home without testing; the <a href=\"https://www.glasgowcitymission.com/\">Glasgow City Mission </a>said guests who had potentially shared a large room with someone who had later tested positive for coronavirus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/coronavirus-case-homeless-shelter-guests-street-glasgow-city-mission\">were not given accommodation</a> when its night shelter was closed because of their insecure immigration status.</p> <p>And more pressure may be coming. Some charities the Guardian spoke to expressed concerns that if prisoners were released from prison, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/21/prisons-could-see-800-deaths-from-coronavirus-without-protective-measures\">has happened in the US, Spain and Iran</a>, they would struggle to cope. \u201cThat would be very unhelpful when we are already dealing with unprecedented demand,\u201d says Mel Hartley, project manager at <a href=\"https://stpetrocks.org.uk/\">St Petrock\u2019s in Exeter</a>.</p> <p>As well as rough sleepers, figures released on Thursday revealed that <a href=\"https://england.shelter.org.uk/media/press_releases/articles/with_a_household_becoming_homeless_every_4_minutes,_better_protection_against_coronavirus_is_needed_for_families_in_emergency_accommodation\">62,280 families </a>are currently living in temporary accommodation in England \u2013 5,400 of those with shared facilities. The number has increased by almost a third in the last five years.</p> <p>Acknowledging that people in already economically precarious situations could quickly find themselves homeless because of the current crisis, the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-law-to-ban-uk-landlords-from-evicting-tenants\">protected people being evicted</a> for non-payment of rent last week.</p> <p>More needs to be done, says Polly Neate, CEO of Shelter. \u201cWe already had people choosing between rent and food. Now, with kids at home, that is going to be even more acute \u2013 they need help now.\u201d</p> <p>But while the situation is critical, it isn\u2019t without hope, says Rick Henderson, CEO of <a href=\"https://www.homeless.org.uk/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIl_mSuNKs6AIVQrTtCh3jqAXnEAAYASAAEgKSMPD_BwE\">Homeless Link</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible, but it will only happen if we take measures that have not been taken out of wartime. We have to take that action now, because if this gets into a 100-bed hostel where people share bathrooms and kitchens, we really are in trouble. The potential impact of it spreading doesn\u2019t bear thinking about.\u201d</p> <p>Many charities the Guardian spoke to said there was political will to tackle the crisis at both a national and local level, a steely determination in the third sector, and compassion in the wider community. On Saturday, Crisis launched the campaign <a href=\"https://www.crisis.org.uk/get-involved/in-this-together/\">In This Together</a> to raise funds to support people who are homeless during the outbreak.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe if we manage to find shelter for all who need it in this crisis, we will actually see that a home for all is possible,\u201d said Melissa Kerschen of Glass Door. \u201cIt sounds like a cliche, but our fates are all interlinked, and this crisis is showing us that.\u201d</p> <p>On the streets of Glasgow, Willy simply hopes he will have a roof over his head soon. \u201cI want to get in somewhere, I\u2019m sick of living on the street,\u201d he says. \u201cI just don\u2019t feel safe. I feel very vulnerable right now.\u201d</p>",

It is very hard to predict the future, but it seems like the situation is not going to be easily resolved and will have a strong impact. All the factors that allowed for this incident still remain the same \u2013 this could happen again \u2013 and a more thoughtful response in terms of social structure and the philosophical understanding of this situation is required.\u201d</p> <p>Ai\u2019s notoriety now of course reaches far beyond the art world. He took the 99-year lease on his Berlin studio in 2010 when he was starting to worry about his safety \u2013 his freedom \u2013 in China. He was right to be concerned: in April 2011, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/apr/03/ai-weiwei-detained-chinese-police\" title=\"\">he was arrested and jailed</a> for 81 days on insubstantial charges. His passport was confiscated and only returned to him in 2015, at which point he came to Germany.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bcf3c19a9198c9f99e7c4d197e4aa2f27ad003ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bcf3c19a9198c9f99e7c4d197e4aa2f27ad003ec/0_411_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ai Weiwei in his Berlin studio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ai Weiwei in his Berlin studio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steffen Roth/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen a friend showed me the space, it was in a very bad condition,\u201d Ai recalls. \u201cThat\u2019s why nobody wanted it: it\u2019s dark, it\u2019s wet, it\u2019s cold. There\u2019s no light down here. So I said: \u2018I want it.\u2019 He was surprised and said: \u2018Why do you want it?\u2019 And I said: \u2018Because there are so many problems, and I like to solve problems!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Before Ai was an artist, he was an architect, and it shows. The studio now has natural light from goodness knows where, and is clinically clean and dry. For the most part, anyway. A while back, he discovered water dripping from the ceiling, so he went to see his upstairs neighbour, the Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson, about it. \u201cOlafur is my dear friend, but we don\u2019t see each other very often, maybe once every three months,\u201d says Ai. \u201cSo I said: \u2018Olafur, it\u2019s leaking!\u2019 And he said: \u2018Oh, I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 And I said: \u2018No, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll call it a waterfall and when you have the chance, come down to sign it!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Those who follow Ai\u2019s work and pronouncements might be surprised to learn that he still has a base in Berlin. At the end of last year, he moved with his partner and 10-year-old son to Cambridge. In January, he gave an interview to the <em>Guardian</em> in which he was so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jan/21/ai-weiwei-on-his-new-life-in-britain-germany-virtual-reality-film\" title=\"\">excoriating about life in Germany</a> that you might imagine that he would never set foot in the country again. Germans, he said, \u201cdeeply don\u2019t like foreigners\u201d. He went even further: nazism \u2013 by his definition, as an ideology that dismisses alternative viewpoints \u2013 \u201cperfectly exists in German daily life today\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa63426c6105bea8a4f61782832679aea4e44a01\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa63426c6105bea8a4f61782832679aea4e44a01/0_277_4852_2911/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of six containers that comprise Ai Weiwei\u2019s work S.A.C.R.E.D, 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of six containers that comprise Ai Weiwei\u2019s work S.A.C.R.E.D, 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What has been the reaction to these comments in Germany? \u201cWhen I chat like this, it is only because journalists ask me and I have to answer,\u201d says Ai. \u201cThe German response was very heavy, very dark \u2013 a form of \u2018love it or leave it\u2019, or \u2018go back to China\u2019 . Or the more intellectual was: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s only a few taxi drivers.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Yes, but that is a long ride.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Ai guffaws, but he\u2019s totally serious. He has to keep his studio in Berlin for now, but would like to relocate. \u201cI know I would never get a place like this, but so what?\u201d he says. \u201cMany people have to leave their nation barehanded, and maybe before they used to have a palace. In China they say, you\u2019re born as a nude person, you die as a nude person. You should understand both ends.\u201d</p> <p>One of the differences Ai sees between the UK and Germany is the engagement with his work and his opinions. He says that he has done more interviews in one week with the British media than in five years with German outlets. \u201cThe Hong Kong riots, the corona situation \u2013 I thought the German press would ask what we think about it, right?\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not blaming them or asking for this, but it makes me feel kind of like I\u2019m in China, because my name cannot be written.\u201d</p> <p>On the evidence of this feature, a You Ask the Questions special, there is certainly an intense fascination with Ai in Britain (there are also at least a couple of questions from Germany, and submissions from all over the world). The many hundreds of inquiries ranged from his early life (Ai\u2019s father Ai Qing was a notable poet who was ostracised for criticising the Maoist regime; the family lived in a cave for five years and his father was made to clean the village toilet) to his opinions on music and food (he\u2019s obsessed with one, not the other). At one point Ai stops me mid-sentence and marvels: \u201cYou have important questions from a lot of powerful people!

But since 2005, when I touched a computer for the first time and started to learn how to type, I began working on the internet and have been reborn.

So in that sense art is dangerous because art doesn\u2019t accept any kind of regulation or any kind of principle; instead you have to go to an unknown area. Art helps our human understanding of our situation.

  "<p>Discomfort is putting it mildly. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/07/shock-of-new-novelists-stories-europe\" title=\"\">Marieke Lucas Rijneveld</a>\u2019s debut novel, which has been longlisted for the International Booker prize, goes all the way to disturbing. A bestseller in the 28-year-old\u2019s native Netherlands, the book begins with a 10-year-old girl, Jas, feeling angry at not being allowed to go ice-skating with her brother Matthies and wishing he would die instead of her rabbit (she fears her unsentimental dairy-farming father has his eye on the pet for dinner).</p> <p>And then her brother does die, falling through the ice.</p> <p>What follows is an unflinching study of a family falling apart in the madness of grief, rendered all the more unnerving for the childishly plain, undramatic way their compulsive behaviours are reported. They are further tested by the arrival of foot-and-mouth disease on the farm (the book is set around the 2001 outbreak), necessitating the slaughter of their beloved cows.</p> <p>Jas\u2019s family are strict Christians \u2013 a background shared with Rijneveld, who still works on a dairy farm. The non-binary author has talked about growing up with a sense of a \u201cthreatening, cruel God\u201d \u2013 and also losing a brother at a young age, which the family barely discussed. Suffering in silence is the fictionalised family\u2019s response too. \u201cWe only knew about the harvest that came from the land, not about the things that grew inside ourselves,\u201d Jas says.</p> <p>Even before Matthies\u2019s death, the parents are pious to the point of punitive; bodily functions are a source of shame. Afterwards, it\u2019s as if teachings about sin, penance and the corporeal become painfully snarled up with the family\u2019s loss, and their desperate attempts to control or master it.</p> <p>Jas refuses to take off her increasingly disgusting red coat, keeps a drawing pin stuck in her belly button and develops chronic constipation (this matter-of-fact scatological novel is not for the squeamish). Her brother, Obbe, obsessively bashes his head on his bedframe and starts killing animals, while her mother refuses to eat an ever-growing list of certain foods.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Rijneveld pokes sticky fingers into nasty places to stir up uneasy prepubescent memories</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Throughout <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-discomfort-of-evening-9780571349364.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Discomfort of Evening</em></a> characters test the limits of bodily boundaries \u2013 their own, and others. Jas\u2019s father shoves soap up her bum to make her poo; her sister sticks her tongue in Jas\u2019s mouth, like \u201ca leftover steak that Mum\u2019s warmed up in the microwave\u201d. There\u2019s a particularly unpleasant scene featuring a metal artificial insemination gun going into a hole it was never intended for.</p> <p>Rijneveld really doesn\u2019t hold back with all this, poking sticky fingers into nasty places to stir up uneasy memories of prepubescent explorations of sexuality and mortality. The novel evokes a general curiosity and bewilderment with the adult world, here given two supercharged shots in the backside by the unspeakable (in all senses) tragedy of the brother\u2019s death and the pressure of extreme religious beliefs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/07/shock-of-new-novelists-stories-europe\">'My family are too frightened to read my book': meet Europe's most exciting authors</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Translated by Michele Hutchison, Rijneveld\u2019s writing is raw and impassive, though often grotesquely vivid in its descriptions.

  "<p>It\u2019s going to get easier, I think to myself, as I lie in bed in the darkness, one hand gripping tightly the edge of the mattress, the other pressing hard on the spot where my head just thudded loudly, again, into a wall. In the bunk below, my cabinmate Oleg is dozing deeply. I might not be sleeping yet, but I will once I\u2019ve found my sea legs. I\u2019ve come a long way, I try to reassure myself, considering it\u2019s only my fourth night at sea.</p> <p>When I arrived on board my temporary new home, <a href=\"https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Greenpeace</a>\u2019s MV Esperanza, even successfully navigating my way to the bathroom along the ex-Soviet firefighting ship\u2019s labyrinth of narrow corridors had seemed impossible. The environmental NGO had invited me to join them on a month-long polar expedition departing from Patagonia, the final leg of a year-long project to draw attention to the existential threats facing the world\u2019s oceans. The crew had set off from London, before travelling from pole to pole.</p> <p>Now though, after a series of briefings, tours and tips from seasoned crew members, I know where to do laundry, where to shower, where to muster in case of emergency. I can quickly put on an immersion suit. I understand three different types of alarm. I\u2019ve scoped out the best hiding spots for when I\u2019ll need some privacy: the cubbyhole library; two nets on the boat\u2019s stern where you can sit as the vast expanse of ocean stretches out behind you; and if all else fails, the floor of the linen closet. I can even use the correct maritime terms to describe the different types of wild, sudden movement the boat is making as we cross the notoriously rough Drake Passage into Antarctic waters: \u201cpitching\u201d up and down, or \u201crolling\u201d from side to side. Still, there\u2019s little anyone can do to help with the tiredness, nausea and bumping into an endless number of metal things that comes with the all-consuming seasickness that has long settled in.</p> <p>Cruising along the Beagle Channel on our first morning \u2013 the calm, breathtaking 240km strait of water we\u2019d sailed through after departing from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/jan/06/take-the-long-view-chile-revisited\" title=\"\">Ushuaia</a>, on the southern-most tip of Argentina \u2013 had lulled me into a false sense of security. \u201cIt is scarcely possible to imagine anything more beautiful than the beryl-like blue of these glaciers,\u201d Charles Darwin wrote of the strait, after an expedition here in the 1830s. He was right. Mainland Argentina on one side, Chilean islands on the other, we\u2019d been smoothly delivered from the final frontiers of South America towards Cape Horn and out into open oceans, passing snow-capped mountains and luscious greenery \u2013 albatrosses, whales and dolphins escorting us from above and below.</p> <p>I\u2019d taken a single motion-sickness tablet as a precaution, after warnings from people who\u2019d made the journey. Honestly? I didn\u2019t understand the fuss. But it turns out that the Beagle\u2019s waters are somewhat more sheltered than those of the wild and exposed Southern Ocean. Only a few days later I\u2019m counting down the minutes until I can pop the next pill. Wave-hits-boat means head-hits-wall, again. That one was probably pitching, I mutter under my breath.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48ec2f8ad82a671c75e7c8095372d385683ec5bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48ec2f8ad82a671c75e7c8095372d385683ec5bf/0_83_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two ships side by side, lit up at night, between two icebergs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frozen assets: secretive \u2018transhipping\u2019 between two boats.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew McConnell/Greenpeace</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s sunlight creeping in through the porthole now. For days, I\u2019ve seen nothing but water. Staring out to the horizon is the only remedy for my unrelenting unease. I clamber quietly down from my bunk and head out for the relief some much-needed fresh air might bring.</p> <p>Stepping out into the crisp morning, though, a surprise is waiting. Three huge, jagged icebergs, somehow both deep blue and ghostly white in the orange light of dawn, jut out from the water right in front me, almost welcoming me into a corner of the world I imagined I\u2019d only ever see on screen. A raft of penguins swims alongside. I\u2019m channelling David Attenborough through my delirium. My stomach stirs with excitement \u2013 my first encounter with the Earth\u2019s last great wilderness is all that I\u2019d hoped for.</p> <p>In the distance, the peaks of the remote South Orkney Islands are appearing. I stand transfixed, the butterflies inside growing ever more restless. And then I run to the bathroom. What I thought was awe and wonder in my gut is, in fact, a sign that I\u2019m about to puke.</p> <p><em><strong>While landscapes come</strong></em> and go, and weather switches from blissful summer sunshine to blizzard and back again with little warning, the routine on board remains reassuringly constant. At 7.30am there\u2019s a wake-up call while a help-yourself-breakfast wraps up in the mess. From 8 to 9am everyone pitches into the cleaning, and then the crew of 30 heads off to work. On the decks below, engineers and fitters keep us moving; from the bridge, mates navigate. A team of deckhands dutifully ensures everything is in working order, while chef Willy prepares lunch for midday. A queue forms at his hatch on the dot.</p> <p>Unless you\u2019re on watch duty, clocking off is at 5pm \u2013 just in time for an unofficial exercise class in the helicopter hangar or a smoke on the poop deck \u2013 before dinner is served up at 6pm. All the while, a small group of investigators, researchers and activists are plotting in a makeshift office. Because while the permanent crew keeps the boat running, it\u2019s these campaigners who truly set its course.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef040916a4a3d1ec208400d669d6a44bd391a753\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef040916a4a3d1ec208400d669d6a44bd391a753/0_156_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Segalov, pictured on Barrientos Island, in the South Shetland Islands, with a group of penguins behind him\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On dry land: Michael Segalov gets a bird\u2019s eye view of the local penguins.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew McConnell/Greenpeace</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Greenpeace</a> employs three ships to further its environmental efforts. Each is represented by a toy boat on a map pinned to a wall, reflecting their current positions. And as each traverses the oceans, an ever-changing team is drafted in from Greenpeace\u2019s international offices to take the helm. From climate change to plastic pollution, deep-sea mining and oil drilling, all manner of issues have been explored on this ambitious voyage. Right now it\u2019s an issue called \u201ctranshipping\u201d.</p> <p>After arriving in the Antarctic proper three days earlier, we\u2019ve anchored in a sheltered bay off the South Orkneys. Glaciers lead down to the water, which is peppered with icebergs. On a distant shoreline, a smattering of structures marks the <a href=\"https://www.bas.ac.uk/polar-operations/sites-and-facilities/facility/signy/\" title=\"\">British Antarctic Survey\u2019s Signy Island Base</a>. The waters might have calmed, but on board the atmosphere is anything but tranquil.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Three huge icebergs appear, deep blue against the orange light of dawn</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Surrounded by maps, charts and laptops, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sophiecooke\" title=\"\">Sophie Cooke, </a>the mission\u2019s lead investigator, is in the campaign room holding a briefing on a direct action set to take place the following morning. </p> <p>Transhipping, Cooke explains, is how fishing boats transfer their catch on to cargo vessels while at sea, swapping fish for fuel, workers and supplies. It\u2019s a system that allows fishing operations to maximise profits, simultaneously making it possible to travel into distant waters with almost no need to return to port. Earlier that day, Greenpeace had published a report that was three years in the making; it set out the harm transhipping can do, both to the oceans and the fishermen on board.</p> <p>It\u2019s how, Greenpeace argues, illegal and unregulated fish are laundered into the market, which is estimated to be worth between $10bn and $23.5bn annually. (\u201cDodgy fish\u201d is mixed together in freezers with more sustainable, better regulated catch.) Human rights abuses at sea \u2013 including poor working conditions and modern slavery \u2013 are well documented, and by transhipping, beyond scrutiny and national jurisdiction, such malpractice is too often out of sight and out of mind. There are three transhipment boats (known as reefers) currently in the South Orkneys, I\u2019m told. Using complex satellite mapping and ship-tracking software, Cooke and her team have identified one of them \u2013 a cargo vessel they suspect has dodgy fish on board.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3b28cfcc2194858a12f7b59fcad330f6a3187aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3b28cfcc2194858a12f7b59fcad330f6a3187aa/0_83_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two crew members below deck on soft seating repairing clothes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mending ways: crew relaxing on board.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew McConnell/Greenpeace</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They plan to attach a giant rubber fender \u2013 emblazoned with the words \u201cOcean Destroyer\u201d \u2013 to the ship in question, and have a group of climbers scale the side using rope ladders, to conduct a vigilante inspection in an attempt to see what\u2019s hiding in the ship\u2019s refrigerated hold.</p> <p>The next morning, from a speedboat, I watch as the team pulls together with military precision. The distinction between crew and campaigner melts away.</p> <p><em><strong>Everyone on board</strong></em> has a story explaining how they ended up here. It\u2019s not the sort of job you can stumble into. For deckhand Usnea Granger, time spent fighting to save ancient Oregon woodland from deforestation as a teenager inspired her to pursue environmental activism. Chief mate Adrian Arauz describes the fields and rivers of his childhood in rural Panama. \u201cIt was instilled in me from an early age that we should take care of our surroundings, because in the end it\u2019s nature that provides.\u201d</p> <p>It was an oil spill off the coast of Galicia in northwestern Spain that first got a young Fernando Romo interested in marine conservation. He recalls with vivid clarity a childhood memory: walking down to the beach in his hometown to be greeted by washed-up dead wildlife, the sand drowning in crude oil. While working on a commercial tanker ship in the 1990s, he and his team were tasked with pumping oil-infused water into the sea. Soon after he became a member of Greenpeace. He was working on their ships by 2008, and promoted to the role of captain in 2017.</p> <p>Compared to my digs, Romo\u2019s cabin is practically palatial. There\u2019s an office with room for a desk and sofa, and penguin postcards pinned to a noticeboard. A thin curtain separates his sleeping quarters from where we\u2019re sitting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2454336d30978cf3c77258e20e53c437c4321c92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2454336d30978cf3c77258e20e53c437c4321c92/0_83_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A complex machine (a Remotely Operated Underwater Vehicle), being operated by gloved fingers, showing the bottom of Discovery Bay, off Greenwich Island in Antarctica, as the team looks for signs of plastic pollution and anchor damage which could be caused by fishing vessels\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emergency response: images from the seabed of Discovery Bay.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew McConnell/Greenpeace</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAs captain, you\u2019re the representative of a ship\u2019s owner,\u201d the 49-year-old says, \u201cand you\u2019re ultimately responsible for the whole operation of the ship.\u201d In normal circumstances, say, on a cargo boat, that means getting your goods from port to port on time with no glitches. At Greenpeace, things are a little different: \u201cWe don\u2019t deliver shipping containers, we win campaigns.\u201d</p> <p>This adds another layer of responsibility and risk to Romo\u2019s workload. He\u2019s not just a sailor, he\u2019s an activist, too. It means breaking laws and putting the boat into situations that most other captains would do everything in their power to avoid.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I become spoilt. The whales aren't as close as the last pod we spotted</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That, Romo says, is how he stays positive. Eco-anxiety and burnout are common among environmental campaigners. I\u2019d have imagined that spending every waking hour fighting for the planet\u2019s future while witnessing firsthand parts of the world most vulnerable to the effects of climate catastrophe might be hard to handle.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know why, but I arrived in the Antarctic expecting to come face to face with our shared, dystopian future. I thought that seals were going to be choking on plastic bags, that chunks of once pristine icebergs were going to be melting into piles of greyish mush. I thought it might trigger alarm bells. Instead, the air is fresher than any I\u2019ve ever breathed, there\u2019s wildlife in abundance, the seawater runs clear.</p> <p>But being here is an eerie reminder that we can\u2019t wait for the consequences of climate change to be visible in places like this \u2013 it will be far too late by then. It\u2019s no coincidence, I\u2019m realising, that the only continent with no permanent population and few visitors is also the one in which nature has best survived the most damaging effects of humankind. And far from despairing, I feel myself becoming more determined than ever to help preserve this unsoiled natural world. It\u2019s suddenly real, no longer an idea in the abstract, or a scene on TV. Spending time with people who\u2019ve given their lives to defending it is a stark reminder that most of us can, and must, play a bigger part in its survival, if we\u2019re to turn the tide.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b45a5086ea02510f89f9322fc4276fa3ec8df95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b45a5086ea02510f89f9322fc4276fa3ec8df95/0_167_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Usnea Granger, a deckhand, in waterproof clothing and helmet, by the pilot door onboard the Esperanza, in the South Orkney Islands, Antarctica\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Campaign trail: Usnea Granger, one of Esperanza\u2019s deckhands.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew McConnell/Greenpeace</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIf anything, I think working for Greenpeace has made me <em>more</em> hopeful,\u201d Romo assures me. \u201cYou\u2019re doing something positive and proactive, and seeing the results of your effort. Last time we came to Antarctica we were campaigning to make ocean sanctuaries to protect wildlife from overfishing. We didn\u2019t achieve everything, but we forced the boats here into creating buffer zones for penguin feeding grounds, and that\u2019s a win.\u201d Romo isn\u2019t complacent. That\u2019s why they\u2019ve come back again. \u201cThe climate emergency is the biggest threat to civilisation as we know it, and that\u2019s a challenge. But if I\u2019m going to be anywhere to fight it, here\u2019s the right place to be.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Two or three</strong></em> <em><strong>weeks in,</strong></em> I\u2019ve lost track of time completely. The team has turned its eye to scientific research. A high-tech underwater robot camera scours the seabed for trash and mysterious species, and we visit the colossal A-68, the largest iceberg to have broken off from the shelf. (It is twice the size of Luxembourg.) Through the mist, it stretches out as far as the eye can see in every direction, a sinister omen of what further global warming might bring.</p> <p>From the South Orkneys we sail closer to the Antarctic Peninsula, a strip of the continent that protrudes northwards into more navigable waters. I become spoilt: a few whales spotted starboard aren\u2019t as close as the last pod; with notes on a whiteboard updating me, the idea of having to plan my own day feels like a drag.</p> <p>There\u2019s on-board wifi keeping me connected to civilisation, although how it works remains a mystery. (It involves, I\u2019m told, a complicated satellite system.) Just a few years ago, being at the end of the world meant losing touch completely. If, say, a panic-inducing medical epidemic happened to sweep the world, you wouldn\u2019t hear about it. I\u2019m grateful I can Skype my family, but while being online is convenient, a part of me was hoping for a little more isolation. I wanted to switch off and experience time spent truly off-grid. Instead, I\u2019m scrolling through Instagram, responding to work emails as if I\u2019m sitting at my London desk. But then, one particularly bumpy afternoon, I drop my iPhone when a big wave hits, and the screen smashes to pieces, so I surrender myself completely to my life at sea.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbcec3afe9f027f3686901042be9cbf93ba6fcd9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbcec3afe9f027f3686901042be9cbf93ba6fcd9/0_126_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A stormy sky and a rubber dingy at sea (with a few people on it) towing a large ship's fender with the words \u2018Ocean Destroyer\u2019 on it\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Storm clouds: activists towing a large ship\u2019s fender.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew McConnell/Greenpeace</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One day, a picture-perfect sunset appears over Discovery Bay, on the north side of the South Shetlands. I polish off my final bottle of stowed-away duty-free Malbec. Then Will McCallum, Greenpeace\u2019s head of oceans, appears with the news I\u2019ve been waiting for: my opportunity to set foot on the continent has finally come. \u201cWhat we have seen sailing from the Arctic to the Antarctic was much more dramatic than we expected,\u201d McCallum explains, \u201cand ocean-going industries are paying scant attention to the need to rein in their worst excesses.\u201d What is at stake, he says, is not only the survival of the creatures that inhabit the waters they\u2019ve visited, but also life on this planet as we know it. The ocean sustains life on Earth by providing us with oxygen; nearly half our planet depends on it for food. Here in the Antarctic, climate change means parts of the continent have reached unprecedented temperatures. Without urgent action the consequences of ice melts, and subsequent sea level rises, will be devastating.</p> <p>Conveniently for me, however, Greenpeace doesn\u2019t just want to highlight destruction. With a team of photographers, videographers and social media types they want to document the continent\u2019s beauty \u2013 to capture just what is at risk.</p> <p>A short trip in the speedboat and I\u2019m standing alone on a green, mossy carpet atop a hill on Barrientos Island. Thousands of chinstrap and gentoo penguins are standing, swimming and shitting on all sides. In front of me, the infinite, silky ocean. Behind, mountains drenched in sun and thick, white snow. It\u2019s bliss. Too soon, it\u2019s time to head back to the Esperanza. A few days later, we\u2019ll begin our long journey home.</p> <p>The sound of us upping anchor for a final time brings with it a sudden panic. My month at sea has left me institutionalised: once I disembark who\u2019ll cook my lunch, pick the film, tell me when and where to be? Most of all, though, I fear I\u2019ve taken my time soaking up the Antarctic\u2019s splendour for granted. Did I make the most of it? What will I do when I look through a window and all this magnificence just isn\u2019t there? I suppose those last ones are probably questions we all have to grapple with. Unless there\u2019s a radical shift in how we interact with our precious planet, there might well come a day when we look up and it\u2019ll have disappeared for good.</p>",

  "<p>For the sake of our loved ones and for all those going out to keep essential services running, Britain must fast become a nation of social distancers. Like many, I suspect, while trying to work from home I\u2019ve been bingeing upon on-demand television. Craving mindless escapism, I decided to give Netflix\u2019s new reality dating show, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/13/love-is-blind-review-toxic-revolting-and-totally-addictive\" title=\"\">Love </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/13/love-is-blind-review-toxic-revolting-and-totally-addictive\" title=\"\">Is Blind</a></em>, a go.</p> <p>I started off quite intrigued by what appeared to be an alluring cross between <em>Blind Date</em> and <em>Big Brother</em>. The premise of the show drops 30 attractive singletons from Atlanta into a blind-dating facility, with the men living in communal space on one side of the building, the women on the other. The only contact they have with each other is in \u201cpods\u201d; two rooms filled with plush sofas, separated by an opaque glass wall.</p> <p>The contestants spend 10 days \u201cdating\u201d each other in these pods, without ever being able to see the physical appearance of their date. The barely there presenters pop up occasionally to lecture them about the groundbreaking \u201cexperiment\u201d they are taking part in that is going to answer the question (cue serious look) \u201cIs love blind?\u201d But there is a twist: \u201cHere, you will choose someone to marry, without ever seeing them.\u201d</p> <p>We spend two episodes watching earnest dates in which people who are tired of a shallow swipe-left dating culture strike up deep conversations, scribbling in notebooks as they go along. Ignore the fleeting mention of the M-word, and you are initially lulled into thinking this worthy series is all about getting past the superficial. Then, halfway through the first episode, a caption flashes up. \u201cDay 2 of experiment. 36 days until weddings\u201d. Wait, what?</p> <p>There\u2019s no more information at that stage; rather, the contestants\u2019 journey to the altar is only gradually revealed. Couples who get engaged to each other in the pods after just a few hours\u2019 contact get to meet face to face on camera, before getting whisked away to a luxury honeymoon-style retreat in Mexico.</p> <p>After that, they return to Atlanta to move into blandly decorated flats together, introduce their fiances to their families, plan their weddings, and go on group hen and stag parties. It all culminates in a series of cliffhanger weddings where we \u2013 and they \u2013 have no idea whether their other half will say \u201cI do\u201d in front of friends and family. Cue high-drama scenes of brides running out of the wedding venue sobbing when (shocker) only a couple of couples make it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>About halfway in, the series starts to feel like it is exploiting some deeply unhappy, vulnerable people</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Netflix probably thinks it has struck gold with this Frankenstein format that borrows bits and pieces from other reality shows. But I grew increasingly uncomfortable as the series progressed. About halfway in, it starts to feel like it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2020/feb/26/netflix-love-is-blind-experiment-straight-heterosexual-marriage\" title=\"\">exploiting some deeply unhappy and vulnerable people</a>. Alcohol plays a starring role: the glasses of wine gulped by contestants seem to get bigger with each episode. By the time we get past Mexico, we are regularly watching insecure people get drunk on screen as they contend with marrying someone they\u2019re not really in love with. Worst of all is the excruciating reunion episode in which some participants, looking traumatised by what they went through, cry on screen as they share their experiences of receiving social-media hate, in real time, when the episodes dropped a year after filming. Meanwhile, the hapless presenters pretend to play the role of therapist.</p> <p>Of course, it\u2019s not just <em>Love </em><em>Is Blind</em>: reality television has had some infamously sick moments, such as when an Indian version of <em>Big Brother</em> screened Jade Goody being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/19/bigbrother.realitytv\" title=\"\">told the news</a> that she had cervical cancer while in the \u201cdiary room\u201d six months before she died. When such programmes run on national channels, there is far more accountability to viewers, whether through debate in the media, chats in the office or the public writing into platforms such as <em>Points of View</em>.</p> <p>Netflix, with its segmented audiences, faces very little of that, and it shows. One participant has described the show as \u201cpsychological warfare\u201d, and claimed she had a conversation with producers about leaving but \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/entertainment/a31233088/love-is-blind-producer-jessica-wanted-to-quit/\" title=\"\">wasn\u2019t able to do that</a>\u201d. All there has been in response is a <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2020/03/04/love-blind-producer-insists-jessica-batten-didnt-go-psychological-warfare-wedding-12347208/\" title=\"\">denial</a> that contestants were \u201cforced\u201d to do anything. It doesn\u2019t feel like public pressure will lead to Netflix or the producers changing things, as <em>Love Island </em>did after early series were marred by boozing, bullying and the subsequent suicides of two former contestants. <em>Love </em><em>Is Blind</em> feels even less responsible than the earliest incarnations of <em>Love Island</em>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/17/an-ethical-nightmare-how-coronavirus-turned-big-brother-into-a-house-of-horrors\">'An ethical nightmare': how coronavirus turned Big Brother into a house of horrors</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Netflix also stands accused of flouting basic standards of safety and decency in other genres. Its drama <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/30/13-reasons-why-netflix-liberty-high\" title=\"\">Thirteen Reasons Why</a></em> \u2013 which had graphic scenes of a teenager killing herself that were removed two years after its release \u2013 has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/16/netflix-cuts-controversial-suicide-scene-from-13-reasons-why\" title=\"\">deplored</a> for glamorising suicide. The true crime miniseries <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/20/dont-fk-with-cats-netflixs-pet-killer-saga-is-2019s-darkest-documentary\" title=\"\">Don\u2019t F**</a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/20/dont-fk-with-cats-netflixs-pet-killer-saga-is-2019s-darkest-documentary\" title=\"\">k With Cats</a></em> has been accused of glorifying the actions of a serial killer while paying little heed to victims. Netflix may have produced some stellar programming in recent years, but it has also appears to have churned out some seriously ethically questionable content.</p> <p>Last week proved a powerful illustration of why a national broadcaster such as the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51931050\" title=\"\">BBC</a> is so important: in a crisis, it has rallied to reorganise its programming to inform, home school and reassure the nation.</p> <p>As ITV and Channel 4 respond similarly, it seems likely viewing figures for live television, a supposedly dying medium, will continue to rocket as we seek news and entertainment designed for collective consumption. That will be quite the pull factor but, as social distancers explore corners of the on-demand catalogue they might not otherwise have bothered venturing into, I do wonder whether there will be something of a push factor too.</p> <p>\u2022Sonia Sodha is an Observer columnist</p>",
  "<p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/rachel-johnson\" title=\"\">Rachel Johnson\u2019s</a> mother used to say, there is no such thing as a wasted experience: however bad things get, there is something to be learned from it.</p> <p>And if not, as her daughter would be the first to add, you can always get a book out of it. So here is that book, a fabulously indiscreet and funny account of her failure to get elected as a pro-Remain MEP for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/07/new-political-party-break-mould-westminster-uk-brexit\" title=\"\">doomed centrist party Change UK,</a> set ruefully against the story of her brother\u2019s glittering success. (You don\u2019t need reminding that Rachel Johnson is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris-johnson\" title=\"\">Boris\u2019s sister;</a> nor does Rachel, who palpably adores him but has a love-hate relationship with being famous at one remove.)</p> <p>I should have loathed this book, but I\u2019m afraid I loved it. It is sheer gossipy joy, the perfect escape from a fug of coronavirus anxiety, yet with just enough dark espresso jolt beneath the froth to satisfy.</p> <p>The Johnsons were raised with the kind of jolly negligence peculiar to the English upper classes, which one suspects is more fun in the telling than in the living of it. Rachel\u2019s mother, an Oxford University-educated artist whose own ambitions were frustrated by successive prams in the hall, declares it a mistake to educate girls because it unfairly raises their expectations; her father packs her off to an all-boys\u2019 boarding school (she and another girl apparently had to have special uniforms made).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is sheer gossipy joy, the perfect escape from a fug of coronavirus anxiety</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Nonetheless Rachel makes it to Oxford, then the <em>Financial Times</em> and the BBC, before deciding (when pregnant with her third child) to embark on what became a rampantly successful freelance career. Yet as first Boris and then her little brother Jo, until recently an MP and government minister, get elected, their teasing about when she plans to get a proper job starts to sting. And so begins her disastrous quest to do something meaningful with her life, or what she describes as the fall of Remainer Rachel and the rise of Brexit Boris; our national story but writ smaller, on a family-sized canvas.</p> <p>Horrified by the prospect of Brexit, she flirts briefly with the Lib Dems before joining Change UK, the breakaway party formed by a handful of defecting Labour and Tory MPs. But she has no sooner made it through the hasty selection process to be a candidate for them in the European elections than the penny drops. The party has no money, no policies and no obvious attraction for voters when the Lib Dems are offering much the same but with more chance of winning.</p> <p>Her Brexit party opponent in the south-west, where she is standing, is the ex-Tory minister Ann Widdecombe, whom she can\u2019t stand (they <a href=\"https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2018/01/19/celebrity-big-brother-rachel-johnson-evicted-calls-ann-widdecombe-a-misogynist/\" title=\"\">met and clashed in the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2018/01/19/celebrity-big-brother-rachel-johnson-evicted-calls-ann-widdecombe-a-misogynist/\" title=\"\">Celebrity Big Brother </a></em><a href=\"https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2018/01/19/celebrity-big-brother-rachel-johnson-evicted-calls-ann-widdecombe-a-misogynist/\" title=\"\">house,</a> of all places) but who still runs rings around her. Deployed as Change UK\u2019s celebrity secret weapon, Johnson ends up looking more like a liability, effortlessly skewered by the <em>Today</em> programme, and giving a disastrous interview to the <em>Times </em>in which she describes herself as a \u201crat on a sinking ship\u201d.</p> <p>There is something gloriously refreshing about an account of political failure in which nobody is trying to excuse or hide the buttock-clenching awfulness of it. But despite the refusal to indulge in self-pity, this is the most uncomfortable part of the book. The party would have crashed and burned without her putting her foot in it, but after all those years on Fleet Street did she really not know better? It\u2019s impossible not to sympathise with the blameless colleagues forced, not for the first time, to clean up behind her. And, yes, all that does remind me of someone.</p> <p>\u201cDoing what we are told not to do is a family trait,\u201d she writes. But so is what she calls the Johnson \u201cdeath wish\u201d, a compulsive desire to say exactly the wrong thing in public. These mini-explosions are not exactly gaffes, but more like the call of the void \u2013 that inexplicable urge to jump that some people feel when standing next to a sheer drop. Even when they know it\u2019s grossly inappropriate, the Johnson instinct is, she writes, to turn everything into \u201ca competition, a game or a joke\u201d, like commitment-phobes who shy away the minute a lover gets serious.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04e25f6f995c9b728e5910f46ce2e3f4d0b18179\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04e25f6f995c9b728e5910f46ce2e3f4d0b18179/0_9_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson and Rachel Johnson attend the London Evening Standard\u2019s 1000 Most Influential Londoners.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson and Rachel Johnson attend the London Evening Standard\u2019s 1000 Most Influential Londoners.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David M Benett/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a remorselessly competitive family \u2013 in which Rachel speculates that Boris\u2019s Euroscepticism might in part reflect a private \u201cOedipal struggle\u201d with his pro-European father \u2013 publicly standing against your own brother\u2019s party in an election is forgivable. But to let slip that you cared about it more than you let on, that you meant it \u2013 well, that would almost be more shocking.</p> <p>Was Rachel Johnson ever serious about standing? To a journalist all life is potential copy, but my hunch is that this was more than a cynical exercise in finding something new to write about. Brexit to her is a \u201ccompass error, harder to correct with every mile travelled\u201d that directly threatens her own children\u2019s futures; she was genuinely afraid, she writes, of what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/27/nigel-farage-immigration-is-not-being-talked-about-enough\" title=\"\">Nigel Farage represented,</a> of the \u201cenemies of the people\u201d rhetoric, and the general willingness to throw everything under the bus in pursuit of victory.</p> <p>There is the smack of female truth too about what she calls her \u201cpost-menopausal\u201d feeling that now the children are grown up, she can finally do something for herself.</p> <p>There is a sadder storyline occasionally struggling to get out, about the feeling of having compromised one\u2019s own ambitions for motherhood and promptly been leapfrogged by men who did not. (When six-year-old Boris famously told a family friend that he wanted to be \u201cworld king\u201d when he grew up, Rachel said she wanted to be a wife and mother, because that\u2019s what the women she knew did; as she ruefully points out, so it has essentially ended up.) Yet she is smart enough to know that this is all more palatable as high farce than impossibly gilded tragedy.</p> <p>The book isn\u2019t perfect, obviously \u2013 she\u2019s a terrible name-dropper, forever referencing what her doubles partner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron\" title=\"\">David Cameron</a> said at tennis, and the galloping speed at which it must have been written sometimes shows. But reading it is the definition of guilty pleasure.

Reading the menu makes me feel like one of those parents standing in the wings during the auditions for <em>Britain\u2019s Got Talent</em>, watching my kids, Ant and Dec\u2019s hands lightly on my shoulders for moral support. I am desperate for the kitchen to succeed. I want to hug them all to my bosom and tell them everything will be OK. I\u2019m also terrified they\u2019ll drop the catch.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is for restaurant goers who are happy to give the kitchen permission to try just a little harder</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is a grossly patronising thing to say to a crew of experienced chefs. But the menu is so ambitiously all over the place, is such a random, swooping collection of dishes, I can\u2019t quite help myself. It\u2019s not so much restless as on the run. Say hello to cooking which draws its inspiration from Mexico or Japan, north Africa or Spain, and a bunch of places in-between. It demands so many skills, so much understanding of how various techniques, spices and dishes sit within a culture, that misfires seem almost guaranteed.</p> <p>Some of it is simply down to the language used. On the menu they describe what they do as \u201cBistronomy\u201d, a venerable word first coined in Paris in the early 90s by skilled chefs tired of the puckered and stiff atmosphere in the city\u2019s grandest garlanded gastro palaces. They wanted to continue being creative, adventurous cooks, but within the frame of a relaxed bistro, with the encouraging pricing that implies. This bright and comfortable space with its industrial ducted ceiling, strand board flooring, and partially open white tiled kitchen, certainly cannot be accused of pretension. For the proctologically challenged, be aware: there are padded banquettes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d9f3ebd0319b21ba4b0221b665188fd55c0abfd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d9f3ebd0319b21ba4b0221b665188fd55c0abfd/466_863_7366_4420/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The chips keep much of their bite\u2019: ham, egg and chips.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The chips keep much of their bite\u2019: ham, egg and chips.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Ridley/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The menu language is a little more trying. A wonton as served here is surely just a dumpling or folded piece of pasta by another misused name? A beetroot \u201cwine gum\u201d is simply a piece of partially dehydrated beetroot. You can decide to be profoundly irritated by this mangling of the lexicon, or you can judge the food on the plate. I\u2019m going with the latter because, for the most part, it works. There are misfires. The batter of salt and pepper squid, from the part of the menu headed \u201csnacks\u201d, doesn\u2019t seem especially interested in staying attached to its host. But it only costs \u00a33.50 so it\u2019s hard to roll your eyes for long.</p> <p>Those beetroot \u201cwine gums\u201d, sweet and chewy, are served with a dollop of horseradish cream to pull them through. They leave strawberry-coloured ribbons through the Dulux whiteness, and are much better. Some dish names are a gentle joke built around understatement. Ham, egg and chips are lumps of smoky, salty, collapsing ham hock, with a cured egg yolk and a big knot of deep-fried, spiralised potato. The latter seems at first a little hard and under cooked, but there is a limpid hammy broth at the bottom of the bowl. The \u201cchips\u201d keep much of their bite as they shatter into it with a whack of the fork.</p> <p>\u201cSpicy carrot wonton\u201d are, as I suggested, just another word for folded-over ravioli, and not especially spicy. But there is a thick celeriac pur\u00e9e here, and a few roasted carrots to maintain the interest. It may not quite match up to its billing, but it\u2019s a solid and reliable bit of cooking. As is a \u00a316 main course of a roasted chicken leg, with a boneless, breaded and deep-fried wing, on a thick truffle pur\u00e9e and chicken jus. Half a roasted leek, singed in various places, slumps across it, languorously. It\u2019s a roast chicken dinner that has polished its shoes and combed its hair. To go alongside we have a bowl of shredded brassicas, through which both toasted almonds and a pokey salsa verde have been spooned. It\u2019s a cheery act of attention to detail. A potato \u201cterrine\u201d is another version of spuds sliced and pressed and cooked, then cut into rectangles and deep fried, which, at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/dec/29/bubala-london-exuberantly-vegetarian-restaurant-review\" title=\"\">Bubala</a> a few months back, were described erroneously as latkes. Whatever the name, they are always welcome.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca3b6acbd42f82e967291d1931daed8415af5a7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca3b6acbd42f82e967291d1931daed8415af5a7a/378_797_7559_4536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Not especially spicy\u2019: spicy carrot wonton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Not especially spicy\u2019: spicy carrot wonton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Ridley/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A vegetable ramen is a dish I find myself nodding at admiringly, rather than adoring. There is a powerful depth to the broth, and the handfuls of toasted barley buried in its steaming depths alongside a load of other veg, make sure nobody will go hungry. But the noodles are replaced by spiralised carrot. It\u2019s an odd call. This is partly because the use of noodles would not have impacted the meat-free nature of the dish. They would have added a little extra starch to the broth and would also have justified calling it a ramen. But mostly it\u2019s an odd call because it makes it seem as if owning a spiralizer is an entirely reasonable life choice, when of course they are implements that deserve to be pointed and laughed at with such malice that they eventually throw themselves into the bin out of embarrassment.</p> <p>Even allowing for the unevenness of that dish I could imagine myself back here trying their version of a multi-layered mole poblano with BBQ lamb and blue corn tacos, just to see whether they could actually pull it off, or the roast hake with paprika chickpea stew. This Farmyard is determined to fatten up its residents.</p> <p>Desserts flip between the outrageous and the outrageously comforting. The former is described as a \u201cwhite chocolate bar\u201d. It\u2019s a sizable block of soft, sticky white chocolate ganache. It would be tooth-achingly sweet were it not for the bold saltiness of the miso caramel slathered across the top, the scattering of peanuts and the intense dark chocolate sorbet. It\u2019s a re-engineered Snickers Bar, perhaps by someone who recently kicked a major crystal meth habit and is now looking for a socially acceptable way by which to get off their face. By comparison a steamed ginger pudding, perched on rings of lightly spiced pineapple with a coconut sorbet is a gentle all-in-one hug and back rub.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9da613f99de321573646f31f17b4d559d4fa00d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9da613f99de321573646f31f17b4d559d4fa00d/540_830_7145_4288/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Re-engineered Snickers\u2019: white chocolate-miso bar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Re-engineered Snickers\u2019: white chocolate-miso bar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Ridley/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Here at Farmyard they may not always achieve every one of their ambitions. Some of those catches really are dropped. But walking back along the Norwich lane it calls home, passed unremarkable pizzerias and reliable looking bistros and cocktail bars designed for a Friday night, the niche it fills became obvious. It is for restaurant goers who are happy to give the kitchen permission to try just a little harder and attempt just a little more. And really, couldn\u2019t we all do with a restaurant like that?</p> <h2>News bites</h2> <p>Right now you may not be considering visiting restaurants, but you will do so again. In the spirit of support for the restaurant sector, this column will continue making recommendations.</p> <p>Just over on the Norfolk coast from Farmyard is No 1 Cromer, which belongs to chef Galton Blackiston of Morston Hall. Downstairs it\u2019s a fine chippie and ice cream bar. Upstairs, there\u2019s a globe-trotting bistro which takes in everything from fish tacos to hoisin duck pancakes, tandoori chicken naan and a massaman vegan curry. It\u2019s ambitious but, generally it works (<em><a href=\"https://www.no1cromer.com/\">no1cromer.com</a></em>).</p> <p>Until the end of April Heston Blumenthal\u2019s three Michelin star Fat Duck in Bray is reducing the price of its menu by \u00a375. It\u2019s still a stonking \u00a3250 with the discount. At time of writing there are some lunchtime tables available in the sparsely spaced dining room. This may be the moment to try it (<em><a href=\"https://www.thefatduck.co.uk/\">thefatduck.co.uk</a></em>).</p> <p>Oisin Rogers, who is the closest thing London has to a celebrity publican, is to take a second boozer under his wing, alongside the Guinea Grill in Mayfair, famed for its beefy menu of steaks and claret.

One was aspiring to be statesmanlike, reassuring an anguished public and mobilizing the awesome power of the American government. The other was more familiar: belligerent, anti-science, racially divisive, airing grievances and resentments and blaming everyone but himself.</p> \n<p>Yet from the blur something else was coming into focus. Having procrastinated at the outbreak of the pandemic, this was the week Trump regained his footing and began to thread a narrative <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/30/brad-parscale-trump-campaign-manager\">aimed at his re-election.</a></p> \n<p>The bid for four more years of power includes muscular language, projecting himself as a wartime leader, a dose of nationalism in stricter border controls and references to the \u201cChinese virus\u201d, and a blitzkrieg at his old foes in the media.</p> \n<p>Although he can no longer hold rambunctious campaign rallies, Trump is instead relishing the medium he knows best by holding televised daily briefings from the White House. Whereas for a while he was forced to play second fiddle to the Democratic presidential primary, now rival Joe Biden is forced to host virtual campaign events \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/us/politics/joe-biden-digital-campaign.html\">plagued by technical glitches</a> - and Trump is back at the centre of events.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/17/steve-bannon-working-class-republicans-labour\">Steve Bannon,</a> a former White House chief strategist, said: \u201cWe are at war, and now by necessity he is a \u2018wartime\u2019 president. Churchill rose to the occasion and secured his place in history. Trump\u2019s moment is here, to grasp or to lose.\u201d</p> \n<p>So far there is little sign that even this trauma, which is shutting down much of the country, has shifted America\u2019s political divide.</p> \n<p>Democrats have eviscerated the president for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/coronavirus-outbreak-response-trump-us\">downplaying the threat of the virus</a> \u2013 Despite Trump\u2019s vague and overoptimistic claims, America is still woefully lacking in testing kits and equipment , and its notoriously flawed healthcare system could soon be overwhelmed.</p> \n<p>However, as in so many other political flashpoints over the past three years, Republicans remain loyal to Trump, and there is no evidence that his \u201cbase\u201d is deserting him. <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/abc-news-coronavirus-poll\">An ABC News/Ipsos poll </a>released on Friday found that 55% of respondents approve of the president\u2019s management of the coronavirus crisis, while 43% disapprove. This represented a switch from a week earlier when only 43% approved and 54% disapproved.</p> \n<p>The finding may reflect a discernible change in Trump\u2019s attitude, starting on Friday 13 March when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/donald-trump-coronavirus-national-emergency\">declared a national emergency.</a> He then expanded travel restrictions on Europe, Canada and Mexico, issued guidelines against group gatherings of more than 10 people, signaled his support for sending cheques to affected Americans and invoked the Defense Production Act to mass produce equipment.</p> \n<p>There was also a change in tone, as he tried to sound more sombre and serious \u2013 with mixed success \u2013 and alluded to the fight against Hitler. \u201cEvery generation of Americans has been called to make shared sacrifices for the good of the nation,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-5/\">he said on Wednesday,</a> citing the teenage volunteers, factory workers and shipbuilders of the second world war.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd now it\u2019s our time. We must sacrifice together because we are all in this together and we\u2019ll come through together. It\u2019s the invisible enemy.\u201d</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/henryolsenEPPC?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Henry Olsen,</a> a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center thinktank in Washington, said: \u201cIt\u2019s the sort of thing that will resonate with his supporters: strength, decisiveness and, let\u2019s not forget, this came from a communist country.\u201d</p> \n<p>At first the concept of a microscopic \u201cinvisible enemy\u201d did not fit the old Trump playbook that prefers to target people, often people of color. But in the past week he found a fix with some characteristic branding, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/trump-calls-covid-19-the-chinese-virus-as-rift-with-coronavirus-beijing-escalates\">\u201cChinese virus\u201d,</a> to constantly remind the public where the respiratory infection originated. On Thursday Trump even crossed out the word \u201ccorona\u201d in his prepared remarks and hand wrote \u201cChinese\u201d instead.</p> \n<p>There was criticism of the term as a xenophobic ploy to fire up his \u201cbuild the wall\u201d support base. </p> \n<p>Olsen said he would have awarded Trump a grade D two weeks ago but the president is now quickly waking up to reality. \u201cThis would be a test of any president and things can change as people rally round. We\u2019ve got a test of the thesis of the anti-Trump and <a href=\"https://lincolnproject.us/\">Never Trump crowd:</a> they always told us when a true crisis came, he wouldn\u2019t be able to handle it. Events will speak for themselves.\u201d</p> \n<p>If the number of deaths soars and the economy craters, Olsen noted, Trump is likely to lose in November. But if the opposite happens, \u201che\u2019ll be able to say he was up to the test. In a sense, we\u2019re at the roulette table and everything is on black and we don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going to land.\u201d</p> \n<p>The virus has scrambled Washington\u2019s political order. The election has temporarily become a sideshow as Congress rushes through billions of dollars in stimulus to stave off a 1930s-style great depression. Senate Republicans, typically the party of small government, low taxes and rugged individualism, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/us/politics/mitt-romney-coronavirus-checks.html\">proposed a direct payment</a> to Americans of up to $1,200.</p> \n<p>Trump earned praise from Andrew Cuomo and Gavin Newsom, the Democratic governors of New York and California states respectively. Yet the president could not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/donald-trump-coronavirus-politics-andrew-cuomo-gretchen-whitmer\">resist tweeting attacks</a> at Cuomo and Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic governor of Michigan. He played little part in negotiating with the Democratic-led House of Representatives, which impeached him a few months ago, dispatching the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, instead.</p> \n<p>In the daily White House briefings the old Trump was never far away, with misleading claims, attempts to blame his predecessor and unhinged outbursts that probably had the career health professionals at his side inwardly cringing. On Friday a reporter asked the president for his message to Americans who are feeling scared. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/20/trump-coronavirus-question-attack-reporter-over-fears\">The reply was less than Churchillian:</a> \u201cI say that you\u2019re a terrible reporter. That\u2019s what I say. I think it\u2019s a very nasty question and I think it\u2019s a very bad signal that you\u2019re putting out to the American people.\u201d</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.panettainstitute.org/about-us/institute-people/leon-panetta/\">Leon Panetta,</a> a former defense secretary and director of the CIA, said: \u201cHe\u2019s still wrapped up in the political traps that he constantly gets bound by as to the press and the Democrats and whoever else is out there who he tweets about. He\u2019s still caught in that paralysis that prevents him, frankly, from really exercising the leadership that the country needs.\u201d</p> \n<p>Regarding Trump\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cChinese virus\u201d, Panetta added: \u201cI have to believe that he continues to use that term as a way to appeal to his base as opposed to trying to exercise what I think would be more responsible leadership in acknowledging that what we\u2019re now dealing with, whether he likes it or not, is the American virus.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump has generally found bad publicity to be more useful than no publicity at all. The crisis has handed him a dominant national platform where Vice-President Mike Pence and other officials lavish him with praise. Biden, meanwhile, marked his latest victories in the Democratic primary race in <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?470455-1/joe-biden-primary-night-remarks\">a streamed video</a> from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, speaking for six minutes in front of a black curtain with no audience.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://watson.brown.edu/people/faculty-fellows/schiller\">Wendy Schiller,</a> a political science professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, said: \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly conceivable Trump survives this and wins the election. If he can keep the death toll down, sell the idea that it could have been worse and show he was a volatile character who turned the corner in a crisis, it\u2019s going to be hard for Biden to unseat him.</p> \n<p>\u201cShowing minimal compassion in the case of Donald Trump may be all he has to do to win in 2020.\u201d</p> \n<p>Should the coronavirus kill thousands and wreak economic destruction, however, voters may well turn to Barack Obama\u2019s vice-president for steadiness and wisdom. Schiller said: \u201cBiden is the epitome of the opposite of Trump in a crisis. If people are going to turn away from Trump, Biden is exactly the person they will go for.\u201d</p> \n<p>Panetta, who has endorsed Biden for president, believes this latter scenario will come to pass. He said: \u201cHistory is not going to be kind with the fact that they knew about this pandemic going back a number of months and did very little to prepare the country to deal with it.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>On Thursday, Northwick Park hospital in London declared a critical incident when it <a href=\"https://www.hsj.co.uk/news/hospitals-critical-care-unit-overwhelmed-by-coronavirus-patients/7027189.article\" title=\"\">ran out of intensive care beds</a> after a surge in the number of coronavirus patients coming through its doors. It is a sign that, in London, the spread of Covid-19 is already threatening to overwhelm hospital capacity. Other areas of the country will not be far behind. As infection rates rise, and the death toll inevitably increases, the experiences of other countries tell us that things will get much worse before they get better. We have been asked by the government to adopt a range of social distancing measures that, so far, have been less stringent than those adopted elsewhere. We implore our readers to stay home to save lives.</p> <p>Scrutiny of the government\u2019s response continues. To ask hard questions about what the government has so far got right and wrong is not to needlessly politicise a crisis: it is to hold our leaders to account in order to ensure that mistakes do not continue. Some aspects of government have inspired great confidence in the last week, others have sowed apprehension and trepidation among scientists and experts.</p> <h2>Why weren\u2019t we ready?<br></h2> <p>The first set of very real concerns are about the government\u2019s preparedness for the crisis; in the present, and ahead. Only last Monday did Matt Hancock, the health secretary, issue a public call for companies that might be able to assist with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/17/uk-manufacturers-regear-factories-build-ventilators-nhs\" title=\"\">ventilator production</a> to contact government. There are now three industrial consortia working quickly to develop a prototype of a medical ventilator that can be manufactured within a month. But the timing of Hancock\u2019s call raises the question: why were these efforts not under way weeks ago, when <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext\" title=\"\">scientists in China</a> were warning the world of the risk of a deadly pandemic? Similarly, the UK\u2019s lack of coronavirus testing capacity is holding it back from pursuing the strategies of mass testing, contact tracing and isolation that have been so successful in holding down infection and mortality rates in South Korea; there is insufficient capacity even to test frontline NHS and care workers who start to display symptoms, meaning they must immediately self-isolate. Why was testing capacity not expanded in preparation for this pandemic?</p> <p>We cannot change where we are now: but it is by understanding the answers to these questions that government can ensure similar errors of forward planning do not cost lives. In particular, the government must be thinking ahead about solutions such as ordering, in good time, those manufacturers who can do so to switch to the production of goods that will be critical in helping the country to weather this crisis.</p> <p>Second, there are real questions about the government\u2019s communications capabilities. In a public health crisis that relies so heavily on changing behaviour in order to control the spread of the outbreak, communication is not an optional extra: it is a critical tool in the fight to save lives. To its credit, Downing Street quickly responded to criticisms of being slow off the mark by introducing a daily press conference last week. But inaccurate news has continued to dribble out from government sources before those briefings; for example, the idea that London would soon see the imposition of a lockdown, which further fuelled panic buying. The government has been to slow to adopt effective messaging to discourage the public from stockpiling.</p> <p>Worryingly, the prime minister himself does not inspire confidence. He has struck the wrong tone at his press conferences, undermining the seriousness of the government message to stay at home as much as possible, for example suggesting that <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-mum-coronavirus-mothers-day-self-isolate-tv-address-today-a9415496.html\" title=\"\">he hoped to see his mother today on Mother\u2019s</a><a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-mum-coronavirus-mothers-day-self-isolate-tv-address-today-a9415496.html\" title=\"\"> Day</a> (a mistake his advisers sought to correct afterwards). His way of speaking to the nation stands in stark contrast to that of Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland, and Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, both of whom have struck far more capable, sober and reassuring tones.</p> <p>Third, there are concerns about the government\u2019s strategy to contain the spread of the virus, which is more lax than those adopted by European countries such as Italy, Spain and France. There appears to be disagreement among scientific and behavioural experts about the extent to which the government\u2019s delays will reduce deaths over the medium term by allowing it to keep stringent restrictions in place for longer when infection rates are even higher than they are now; or whether it is needlessly costing lives. Only time will tell.</p> <p>But, given our lack of testing capacity, a more stringent approach now could presumably buy more time to increase ventilator, critical care and testing capacity. The government distanced itself from its explicit suggestion that it was consciously trying to develop herd immunity by allowing 60% of the population to become infected in the coming months, once it realised that this would result in an intolerable number of deaths. We need confidence that Boris Johnson will not hesitate to introduce stricter restrictions in order to save lives, regardless of any personal distaste he may feel for temporary curtailments on people\u2019s liberties.</p> <h2>Cometh the chancellor</h2> <p>The government\u2019s economic response, coordinated by Sunak, has been far more confidence-inspiring. We applaud the chancellor for taking swift action to intervene to save jobs and increase the generosity of a benefits system that has been devastated by 10 years of austerity inflicted by his predecessors. The Treasury has announced that it will pay 80% of wages, up to \u00a32,500 a month, for employees that have been furloughed by their employers. In addition, the standard annual allowance of universal credit has been increased by \u00a31,000 for a year, and the link between housing benefit and local rents has been restored. This is a sorely needed package of measures that will run into the tens of billions at least. But as the <a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/press-releases/government-sets-out-unprecedented-but-essential-pledges-to-underwrite-wages-and-strengthen-the-safety-net/\" title=\"\">Resolution Foundation</a> has pointed out, there are significant gaps: there is very limited support for the self-employed, most of whom will have to claim unemployment benefit, and for the two million workers who do not earn enough to qualify for statutory sick pay.</p> <p>Many families will struggle to cope with the impacts of social distancing on their physical, mental and financial wellbeing. But those who have safe places to isolate are in an immeasurably better position than some of the most vulnerable and destitute in our society. There has been far too little action on protecting homeless people, those locked up in prison and immigration detention, vulnerable children and victims of domestic abuse.

But we cannot simply rely on government to get us through this.

But it is within all of our power to ensure that we look after each other and do all we can manage to minimise the number of lives that will be claimed by this pandemic. Every day, NHS staff and care workers, teachers and nursery workers, delivery drivers and supermarket staff are exposing themselves to greater risk to ensure that people are cared for and can eat while we fight this threat. Every day, older people and the immuno-compromised will be self-isolating, worried about the possibility of contracting a virus that could cost their life. It falls to the rest of us to guard them from harm as much as we can. Stay at home; protect the NHS; save lives.</p>",

After all, the most pressing questions have only one answer: \u201cWe don\u2019t know, so please stay at home.\u201d</p> <p>Instead, let me bring you two new podcasts. Initially, I thought them very different, but actually, they have a lot in common. First, <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000ghxl\" title=\"\">Girl Taken</a></strong>, from Radio 4. In this podcast, journalist Sue Mitchell retells a strange news story that took place in the recent past. In 2015, Rob Lawrie, a British volunteer at the Calais refugee camps, was caught smuggling a four-year-old Afghan girl called Bru over the French-English border in his van. Lawrie, a charismatic, enthusiastic man who believes in good and would do anything to help anyone, had met Bru and her father, Reza, in the Calais camp. It was a spur-of-the-moment decision on his part to take Bru with him, and he thought it would be easy: just get her into England and then deposit her with some of her relatives in Leeds. But he was caught and taken to the French courts. Astonishingly, he was let off with a suspended sentence. When he returned home, his wife had moved out and taken their kids. She couldn\u2019t believe he would do something so reckless without consulting her.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s clear that Karbaat thought that he was acting for the best and didn\u2019t tell anyone what he was up to</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Mitchell, who knew Lawrie and liked him, has already made a couple of documentaries about this nutty tale, and she and he take us back through what happened. It\u2019s simultaneously gripping, touching and maddening. Lawrie is lovely, striding about the place in his red Stetson hat, but so naive, so desirous of attention. He\u2019s another child, really. Anyway, halfway through the series, things change. Lawrie receives an unexpected email, and the whole mad tale whizzes off again. It turns out that Bru\u2019s background is not what it seems, and the story that Lawrie had been told by her father is far from the truth. No spoilers, because this is a very unusual piece of reporting, worth following to the end. All the episodes are <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000ghxl/episodes/player\" title=\"\">up now on BBC Sounds</a>.</p> <p><em>Girl Taken</em><strong> </strong>did make me think, though, how lives can be utterly changed \u2013 and not for the better \u2013 by men who think that they, personally, know best. The type of chaps who forget to consult anyone else when they make a decision, whose sounding board is their own conscience and mind. Some might mean well, but good intentions don\u2019t mop up the consequences. We learn that Reza acted extremely selfishly but so, too, did Lawrie.</p> <p>Another true story podcast, <strong><a href=\"https://www.somethinelse.com/projects/the-immaculate-deception/\" title=\"\">The Immaculate Deception</a></strong>, started last week. It has a very different subject matter, and I\u2019m not revealing too much when I say it\u2019s about a Dutch infertility doctor who turned out to be all too fertile himself. By the end of episode one (other episodes will be released weekly, on a Wednesday), we know that said doctor has fathered more than 60 children; children whose mothers believed were created using sperm from either an anonymous donor, or by that of their partners, through IVF. These children are now grown up and call themselves Karbastards (the doctor\u2019s name was Jan Karbaat). We are led through the story by writer Jenny Kleeman, who, like Mitchell in <em>Girl Taken</em>, is an excellent, careful presenter. She talks to Joey, one of Karbaat\u2019s children, who sensed that something was wrong throughout his life \u2013 even though his mother was convinced that her husband, his dad, was his biological father.</p> <p>Oh, but the doctor was \u201ccharming, empathic\u201d, according to one of the mothers; he told his clients what to do and they did it. Even at this early stage, it\u2019s clear that Karbaat, too, thought that he was acting for the best and didn\u2019t tell anyone what he was up to. Hmmm. Beware those action men who never ask for advice.</p> <h2>Three calming podcasts</h2> <p><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/gaba/id1480815448\" title=\"\">Gaba</a><br>A highly original podcast offering a mix of meditation, soundscape and soul-baring. The reassuring Adam Martin is our host, and his words are near to poetry, hovering over tweeting birds, familiar and unfamiliar music and sampled speech, often from old films or songs. The effect is usually calming (though I found last week\u2019s episode, <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/corvid-19/id1480815448?i=1000468159062\" title=\"\">C</a><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/corvid-19/id1480815448?i=1000468159062\" title=\"\">orvid-19</a>, somewhat agitating). This week\u2019s, entitled <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/keep-calm-carry-on/id1480815448?i=1000468833876\" title=\"\">Keep Calm Carry On</a>, mixes Joanna Lumley, David Attenborough, Charles Hawtrey, The Lark Ascending, the sounds of fighter planes and a poem that\u2019s been popping up on Instagram. Lovely.</p> <p><a href=\"https://fieldrecordings.xyz\" title=\"\">Field Recordings</a><br>Producer extraordinaire <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ellie_McDowall\" title=\"\">Eleanor McDow</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ellie_McDowall\" title=\"\">all</a> has got her audio friends to stand silently in fields, or on top of mountains, or anywhere quiet really, and record the sounds around them. Which perhaps seems a little odd, but the result takes you to a place you\u2019ve never seen, simply through the noises there. Best on headphones, you can choose from various locations. One of the nicest is the sound recorded on a balcony in Rome during the lockdown, with kids singing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ah637P0_cts\" title=\"\">Volare</a> in the distance, the sound of the church bell and a train rumbling past.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m000gcx5\" title=\"\">Lights Out: The Space Between Stories</a><br>Every episode of this Radio 4 soundscape series is worth hearing, but this week\u2019s is especially apt. Unnamed voices consider individualism: how we\u2019ve long been told that the best way of life is to be entirely separate, to consider ourselves and our own progress, to invest in ourselves rather than the collective. \u201cMuch of what we consider to be real is obviously just a system of agreements\u2026 these stories rest on deeper unconscious stories, and at the bottom is the story of separation.\u201d This is an amazing, mind-expanding listen, perfect for these changing times.</p>",

The Miss World of 1970 was a concatenation of late-60s anger, a perfect storm in which feminist activists and similarly justified anti-apartheid movers and shakers descended, colliding and sometimes colluding, on the Albert Hall, and the world shifted a twitch on its axis.</p> <p>Hot on the heels of the new film <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/14/misbehaviour-review-miss-world-contest-jessie-buckley-gugu-mbatha-raw\" title=\"\">Misbehaviour</a></em>, a quite marvellous BBC Two documentary, <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000gghb\" title=\"\">Miss World 1970: Beauty Queens and Bedlam</a></strong>, sought, through tracking down a gratifying number of original participants, to convey just what a shock to the televisual assumptions of the time this must have been. As the woeful guest host Bob Hope stumbled through his patter, every patronising sneer or lustful lech unbelievably lower than the previous low, one activist stood up on the plush balcony and shook a football rattle: the signal for 100 feminists, sprinkled secretly throughout, to launch smoke bombs and pamphlets on the spangled audience below. And launched niggling thoughts, surely, in a tiny fraction of the 100 million viewers watching.</p> <p>And the world shifted on its axis, though it wasn\u2019t for the want of trying to stop it by the British press. The interrupters were near universally vilified as hairy-legged lesbians. And, coincidentally, two women of colour had triumphed: Miss Grenada won, Miss Africa South had trumped white Miss South Africa \u2013 a risibly false distinction by which that country\u2019s government was still seeking to segregate, only to be bitten right on the arse \u2013 to come second. They had it even worse than the feminist campaigners, with an odious News of the Screws headline: \u201cWell, <em>is</em> she the most beautiful girl in the world?\u201d seeking to suggest that a black woman could never be considered anyone\u2019s version of idealised beauty.</p> <p>But shift it did. One of the things that struck me about this was that \u2013 despite the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/23/in-1970-driven-by-chaos-and-energy-we-felt-like-pioneers-in-female-protest\" title=\"\">original campaigners</a>, many of whom had first met at that famous Ruskin women\u2019s liberation conference of 28 February 1970, giving generally dispirited views today on how much feminism had moved since \u2013 there can be no doubt how <em>any</em> person today views this doc. Whether watching the Mecca-pimp <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/nov/10/guardianobituaries2\" title=\"\">Eric Morley</a> microcontrolling the contestants with chaperones, or the milder Michael Aspel\u2019s simperingly sexist co-host, or the assumption that if you hadn\u2019t caught a man by means of <em>looks alone</em> by 21, then, well\u2026 you will have been shocked/pleased at how far social changes have come in 50 years. The other thing that struck was how graceful and eloquent both campaigners and contestants have become in late middle age: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/09/miss-world-contest-1970-new-film-misbehaviour-jennifer-hosten-first-black-winner\" title=\"\">Jennifer Hosten</a> and runner-up Pearl Jansen were mightily impressive, having become in their own way activists, even feminists; no less so the spirited ex-squatters. It\u2019s a tired cliche, yes, but so often things that divide us are lesser than\u2026</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOrdHgwa4Dk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LOrdHgwa4Dk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOrdHgwa4Dk\">Watch a trailer for Penance</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Channel 5 continued its cheeky drive to be the, or at least <em>a</em>, new home for quirky, quality, original drama writing, chiefly of the psychodramatic variety. It does much badly \u2013 the daily Jeremy Vine show has become a solid couple of hours of coronavirus when, surely, the very last thing we need more of is viewers phoning to kindly share their latest misinformed internet blather \u2013 but this \u2013 this, it does well. Its latest offering, <strong><a href=\"https://www.channel5.com/show/penance/\" title=\"\">Penance</a></strong>, an adaptation of the Kate O\u2019Riordan novel, has Julie Graham as Rosalie, being gaslit, after the death of her son, into taking in a lodger in the pretty-boy shape of Nico Mirallegro\u2019s Jed.</p> <p>Jed will first inveigle his way into the daughter\u2019s bed and then, much to her conflicted angst, her mum Rosalie\u2019s, while Art Malik does (finely) the job of a conscience in the shape of the Catholic priest, and Neil Morrissey as the father does\u2026 well, whatever it is that Morrissey does. Flawed, then, but entirely and utterly watchable, and in Mirallegro we find a young actor truly able to convey charm and menace in equal degrees.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.sky.com/watch/channel/sky-atlantic/westworld\" title=\"\">Westworld</a></strong> also found a new axis, after a thoroughly confusing, to the point of blathery, second series. The hosts (the robots) have escaped the park, finally. Worryingly, they have learned to create simulacra of people in the real world. Because the purpose of the park has been semi-revealed: it wasn\u2019t to give guests their jollies but to harvest all their data. With me so far? It\u2019s worth being with me so far plot-wise because this series, never mind the lush filming, threatens much in the way of lickable, toothsome plot. Dolores is on a spree to destroy all those who raped her in the Westworld park, and you will never listen to Pulp\u2019s Common People in quite the same way again.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.sky.com/watch/bulletproof\" title=\"\">Bulletproof</a></strong> returned, with supercops Ashley Walters and Noel Clarke once again kicking bottom all over London.

As long as \u2013 and this is crucial \u2013 you take it for precisely what it is. It\u2019s a Laandan crime caper, innit?

Sydney\u2019s famous Bondi Beach, from Australian Associated Press.</p> \n  <p>The New South Wales government has temporarily closed Bondi Beach as authorities handed lifesavers unprecedented move-on powers amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n  <p>NSW Police David Elliott announced the drastic measure on Saturday afternoon after photos of throngs of beachgoers flocking to the iconic Sydney strip drew swift condemnation.</p> \n  <p>Thousands flocked to Bondi Beach on Friday amid temperatures in the high 30s, ignoring social distancing measures.</p> \n  <p>Pictures of big crowds were criticised by foreign media and on social media.</p> \n  <p>The decision comes as the number of coronavirus cases in NSW ballooned to 436 after 83 new cases were identified in the state.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a significant level of disappointment that we have to move today to not only remove people from Bondi Beach and it\u2019s a significant opportunity to remind people that the Health Act must be complied with,\u201d Mr Elliott said.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cWhat we saw this morning at Bondi Beach was the most irresponsible behaviour of individuals that we\u2019ve seen so far.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe cannot have an area where more than 500 people are gathered.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Under regulations introduced to control the spread of the deadly virus, outdoor gatherings of 500 people or more have been banned.</p> \n  <p>As part of that, lifesavers will have the power to close beaches and ask people to move on if a crowd of 500 or more is gathered at the same spot.</p> \n  <p>The minister said that if the crowd does not comply, NSW Police will have the powers to make people leave.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThis is not something we\u2019re doing because we\u2019re the fun police, this is not something that the government is doing because we want to make life easy, this is about saving lives,\u201d Mr Elliott said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cTomorrow in NSW we will probably crack 500 cases of coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIf the community does not comply with the regulations and the health warnings, this is going to become the new norm.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe are going to close down the type of activities we\u2019ve grown to love.\u201d</p> \n  <p>It came as Waverley mayor Paula Masselos on Saturday issued a public plea for people to stay away from Bondi amid the coronavirus pandemic and away from beaches.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cThe public must at all times keep a minimum safe distance from each other in public places and if you don\u2019t need to be out in public, please consider staying at home,\u201d Mr Masselos said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe all have a role to play in preventing the spread of COVID-19 and I am frustrated that people continue to ignore health advice about social distancing as observed yesterday at Bondi Beach.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt also hit out at people who flouted social distancing advice and risked spreading the virus.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cWhat happened in Bondi was unacceptable and the local council must take steps to stop that occurring,\u201d Mr Hunt said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cEach of us as individuals, as families, as groups, as councils, as state governments, as a national government has responsibility.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWhere something like this is occurring the local council must step in and that message is

second-highest number of daily positive diagnoses this week</strong>, following 152 identified on Wednesday, according to the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).<br><br>The pace of daily new infections had shown signs of slowing since the second week of this month after health authorities finished testing 210,000 followers of a secretive church that was at the centre of the country\u2019s outbreak.<br><br>Just over 100 of the new daily cases were from Daegu, the southeastern city where the church is located, and nearby North Gyeongsang province. The two locations account for about 60% of all of South Korea\u2019s Covid-19 infections. <br><br>There is concern, however, over a rise in infections in Seoul and among people arriving from overseas, Yonhap news agency said.<br><br>Seoul reported 15 additional cases and nearby Gyeonggi Province 12, while the number among people arriving in the country rose by six to 23.<br><br>In response, South Korea will require all arrivals from European countries to get tested for the virus and self-isolate for two weeks starting Sunday, Yonhap said, adding that temporary shelters had been set up to accommodate up to 1,000 European travelers while they wait for their test results.<br><br>South Korean health authorities have won praise for their mass testing regime, which has enabled them to quickly identify infection clusters. The number of people being checked for the virus and under quarantine came to 15,704 as of Friday, the KCDC said. The country has tested a total of 327,509 suspected cases, with 303,006 coming back negative.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-21T04:09:15.056Z\">at 4.09am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e758eb78f08dcc95cc2076e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-21T03:58:45.534Z\">3.58am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>People living in poorer areas of the Philippine capital, Manila, have begun building makeshift barricades to halt movement along the tight alleyways of their neighbourhoods, as this image, taken by Ezra Acayan for Getty Images shows.</p> \n  <p>The Philippine island of Luzon, which includes Manila, has been on lockdown since Monday.
