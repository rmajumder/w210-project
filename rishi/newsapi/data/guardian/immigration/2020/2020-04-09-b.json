There has been a lot of progress in ramping up testing capabilities, with pretty much all countries on the continent now theoretically able to test their citizens for the disease. As elsewhere however, there are shortages in the key chemicals needed for the tests, and that\u2019s causing problems.</p> \n  <p>This is particularly true in South Africa, which has the highest number of cases and has adopted a strategy based on aggressive screening and testing to try to stamp out any clusters and outbreaks of the disease before it can spread.</p> \n  <p>Officials in South Africa have yet to decide whether to extend the lockdown in South Africa, now in its third week.

One possibility may be to lift some restrictions but maintain strict rules to limit social distancing, but, they say, nothing is decided.</p> \n  <p>Other governments across the continent will face similar decisions in coming days and weeks.

The other person who runs or cycles just behind this leading person in the slipstream then moves through that cloud of droplets.</p> \n   <p>The slipstream is the zone that arises right behind a person when they are walking or cycling, and which pulls the air a bit along with this moving person, as it were.</p> \n   <p>Cyclists like to position themselves in the slipstream of others to reduce their air resistance. But someone who walks or runs also has such a slipstream. We have seen that no matter how that zone forms, droplets end up in that air stream.

this will provide a short-term source of additional liquidity to the government if needed to smooth its cashflows and support the orderly functioning of markets, through the period of disruption from

  "<p>Coronavirus is man\u2019s work. At least, that appears to be the government\u2019s assessment of it, for in the three weeks of daily Downing Street press briefings, not once has a woman minister been allowed out to be front-of-house compere. Priti Patel, Liz Truss and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey have become all but invisible. Missing in action. They might as well not exist.</p> <p>For the third time this week it was Dominic Raab \u2013 the de facto prime minister while Boris Johnson is in intensive care \u2013 who did the business for the government. And, to be fair, he\u2019s getting visibly better at it. He looks less unstable and more the man who can easily see out 24 hours of close police interrogation over unsolved missing persons cases. Though he might have struggled if anyone had questioned him about the disappearance of the home secretary.</p> <p>It also helped that the foreign secretary didn\u2019t have any news, other than the grim daily death statistics, to impart. So he could stick to doing what he knows best, which is spilling out a random series of words, only some of which amount to fully coherent sentences. At some point in his career, the black-belt martial arts specialist is going to have to realise that the brain is also a muscle. Coming up with lines like \u201cWe are focusing on the things we need to focus on\u201d may sound impressive at cabinet meetings, but doesn\u2019t translate well to those of us who speak human.</p> <p>Still, after Raab had spent the best part of five minutes telling everyone to stay at home for Easter \u2013 the No 10 lectern had been helpfully updated with this new logo \u2013 it did become clear why Patel might have dodged a bullet by being excluded from this briefing. Because Raab went on to deliver a long thank-you to all the NHS staff, care workers, hospital cleaners, delivery drivers and supermarket staff who were keeping people alive and the country running: the very people who would never have been let into the country if the home secretary had been allowed to implement her points-based immigration system a few years earlier. For Priti, ideology is all. She didn\u2019t vote to take back control to have an immigrant clean a hospital floor or operate a supermarket checkout.</p> <p>\u201cWe now know who the key workers really are,\u201d said Raab. Indeed we did. And to the surprise of many Tory MPs, they weren\u2019t the hedge-fund managers or party donors they had imagined. Here Raab\u2019s legendary ability to dissociate came in handy. Because back in 2010, he, Patel and several other leading Tories wrote a book, Britannia Unchained, in which they advocated increased austerity, doubling down on laissez-faire economics and branded the Brits as some of the idlest people in the world.</p> <p>But some things don\u2019t change. Asked if the government might care to show its gratitude to the key workers with a cash bonus once the pandemic was over, Raab became evasive. Money, what money? Wasn\u2019t it enough for these workers to have saved the country before being asked to leave? At times like these, Dom could almost be a double for David Brent. \u201cThe bad news is that some of you will lose your jobs. On a more positive note, the good news is that I\u2019ve been promoted \u2013 so every cloud, eh?\u201d</p> <p>Not that Raab seemed overly keen to emphasise the extent of his new powers as de facto prime minister. If anything, he tried to downplay them, suggesting that all cabinet decisions were now more like tantric meditation sessions. </p> <p>Unfortunately, the answers provided by that process can be less than crystal clear. Raab was as evasive on what the government strategy for determining the timing of the end of the partial lockdown might be \u2013 journalists have long since given up asking for an actual date \u2013 as he was on why the government had had to increase its overdraft with the Bank of England. Where was Rishi when you needed him?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/23/tell-us-have-you-been-affected-by-the-coronavirus\">Tell us: how have you been affected by the coronavirus?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The biggest unanswered question, though, was the one that has been left hanging over every press conference. Why is Germany handling the crisis so much better than us? Some projections suggest the German death rate from the coronavirus will be about 10% of ours. What\u2019s their secret? Raab, Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance all just shrugged their shoulders. They had no idea. Or none fit for public consumption.</p> <p>You could almost sense the desperation in Dom\u2019s voice as he pleaded one last time for calm over Easter. Being in charge isn\u2019t nearly so much fun as he had imagined. He\u2019s missing Boris badly. Weirdly, I am too. At least with Boris you get some kind of hopeful bollocks. With Raab you just get bollocks. In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.</p>",

Because when you look at the systemic and economic factors facing black people in America, it makes complete sense.\u201d Black people are overall less likely to have health insurance, more likely to have pre-existing health conditions such as diabetes, and more likely to be in service jobs without work-from-home options.</p> <p>\u201cAnd of course, there\u2019s always just straight-up racism that affects black people as well,\u201d Noah said, such as implicit bias leading doctors to discount symptoms. \u201cSo while almost every industry around the world is shut down, it looks like racism is still considered an essential service.\u201d</p> <h2>Samantha Bee</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6Z6fzpJXAA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/J6Z6fzpJXAA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>As the coronavirus crisis extends into another month, \u201cthe Trump administration has been busy abusing their power and pulling some truly shady shit while we\u2019ve all been busy crafting masks out of our underwear,\u201d said Samantha Bee on Full Frontal. Bee presented a distressing list of changes: rollbacks of EPA regulation and emission standards, and more abuses of power at Ice, \u201cthe least necessary government agency since the Bureau of Cassette Tapes and LaserDiscs\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIce decided that since everyone isn\u2019t terrified enough right now, they should keep doing raids while people are stuck at home,\u201d Bee said, noting how agents in Los Angeles had made arrests on the first night of California\u2019s lockdown. \u201cHow is it essential to separate families during a health crisis? The only separation that desperately needs to be done right now is separating my hair from my body. I\u2019ve been a mess since my waxing place closed.</p> <p>\u201cTrump has also used the virus as an excuse to try to slash taxes, make the cuts to the federal interest rate that he already wanted to and to advance anti-union efforts,\u201d Bee continued, which is \u201cthe most work he\u2019s ever done. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever say this but someone please find a way to sneak him on to a fucking golf course!</p> <p>\u201cI know it\u2019s hard to think about anything other than our families, our friends or what our tits will look like after months of not wearing a bra,\u201d Bee concluded, \u201cbut unfortunately, we have to. What our government does right now will have a lasting impact on all of us, long after this pandemic is over.\u201d</p> <h2>Seth Meyers</h2> <p>\u201cSeems like almost every day we get more and more evidence that the Trump administration knew well in advance of the very real threat of a pandemic, and that they both ignored it and lied to the American people about it,\u201d said Seth Meyers on Late Night. He showed a series of clips in which Trump claimed the pandemic was impossible to predict, such as: \u201cNobody knew there\u2019d be a pandemic or an epidemic of this proportion.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OozvkPVI7LI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OozvkPVI7LI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cSo nobody could see this coming,\u201d Meyers deadpanned. \u201cYeah, Taiwan and South Korea and New Zealand and Singapore were all surprised. That\u2019s why they have a combined total of 12,000 cases and we have a total of 400,000 cases.</p> <p>\u201cDespite Trump\u2019s repeated claims that no one could have foreseen this, it turns out a lot of people foresaw this,\u201d Meyers continued and listed the times Trump was warned about the pandemic:</p> <p>\u201cFirst, Obama officials walk Trump aides through a global pandemic exercise in 2017. Then, in 2017 and 2018, threat assessment intelligence analysts even mentioned a close cousin of coronavirus by name, saying it had pandemic potential. Then in 2018, the director for medical and biodefense preparedness at the national security council told a symposium that the threat of pandemic flu is our number one health security concern. Then, top administration officials said last year that the threat of a pandemic kept them up at night. Then, White House economists warned in 2019 a pandemic could devastate America. Then, intelligence reports warned of a coronavirus crisis as early as November. And then, US intelligence reports from January and February warned about a likely pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cWell, you know, the saying: eight strikes and you\u2019re out,\u201d Meyers concluded. \u201cSeriously, how many incredibly specific warnings do you need?\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Coronavirus is the great leveller. Rich or poor, we have all been plunged into turmoil, insecurity and isolation, bonded together by our inability to imagine what life will be like in two weeks, let alone two months. Tell that to Jhon, a 46-year-old chef at the Warrington Hotel, a plush pub in the leafy west London district of Maida Vale. On 18<sup> </sup>March, he and two kitchen porters were sent a letter from their bosses announcing \u201csome extremely difficult decisions\u201d had to be made that meant their positions had \u201cbeen made redundant\u201d. No furlough, no 80% wage subsidy for his \u00a310-an-hour pay packet; a man with four children to support has been thrown into extreme hardship.</p> \n<p>It gets worse. Rather than being paid for their outstanding holiday, the workers have been ordered to use it up during their notice period: a straightforward violation of the law. When their trade union, the Independent Workers\u2019 Union of Great Britain (IWGB), asked the pub\u2019s owners why the workers were being dismissed \u201cdespite having the ability to pay the wages and its bills after the government\u2019s help package\u201d and announced legal action, the only reply they received was \u201cNoted\u201d.</p> \n<p>What does he feel when we\u2019re told \u201cwe\u2019re all in this together\u201d, I ask him. \u201cI feel angry, it\u2019s just not true,\u201d Jhon tells me through a translator: he is a migrant worker from Colombia. \u201cThe owners of the hotels and the other businesses are only looking for profit, leaving everyone else unprotected. They don\u2019t care about us.\u201d He\u2019s always been a responsible, loyal employee, he says, since he started working at the pub seven months ago. Now he feels angry, helpless, \u201cshocked at the lack of humanity by these people at the top\u201d, worried about rent, bills, and \u201csimple things like buying food\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>For some, this is both a national and personal disaster, a present defined by turmoil and of futures snatched away</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Coronavirus is not some grand leveller: it is an amplifier of existing inequalities, injustices and insecurities. We hear the constant invoking of the second world war: but despite the horror of Nazi bombs, the living standards and health of poorer Britons <a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/9728#1\">benefited from rationing </a>and full employment. In the age of Covid-19, the rubble of economic collapse will fall on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/31/young-people-have-paid-enough-spare-them-from-footing-the-coronavirus-bill\">those who suffered the most from the last crash</a>: the young, the precarious, the low-paid.</p> \n<p>If you are wealthy, you have savings; you may own your property outright, or at least have relief in the form of a mortgage holiday. Renters on the other hand, who even in normal times part with a huge portion of their wage bills, now have the National Residential Landlords Association wagging its fingers in their faces, telling them that the pandemic is not a \u201cgreen light\u201d for them not to pay their rent. Many find themselves asking what exactly they\u2019re meant to pay their rent with.</p> \n<p>As the <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/14795\">Institute for Fiscal Studies notes</a>, the better-off may actually increase their savings as spending on forbidden activities falls; but poorer households spend much more of their limited income on necessities, leaving them vulnerable to sudden falls in their incomings. Indeed, millions who spend their lives treading water now face being sucked under by strong currents.</p> \n<p>The wealthy are also more likely to be able to work from home. In the United States, a study of mobile data reveals that the wealthy are moving around less than the least well-off: they can afford to self-isolate and did so quicker than their poorer fellow citizens. As the New York Times headline aptly put it: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/03/us/coronavirus-stay-home-rich-poor.html\">\u201cLocation Data Say It All: Staying at Home During Coronavirus Is a Luxury\u201d</a>. It is no different here, of course: while managers conduct high-powered meetings on Zoom, their cleaners still travel across cities on early-morning buses to clean half-empty offices.</p> \n<p>Then there\u2019s the issue of space. While many middle-class children play in expansive gardens, much of the urban poor find themselves locked away in overcrowded accommodation, risking a police reprimand if they loiter around parks. Those with violent partners or abusive parents, or, for LGBTQ youth, all too often hostile families, have nowhere to go. For some, home is a sanctuary; for others, it was a place of fear before the pandemic, and now it is a prison.</p> \n<p>Finally, nurses, care workers, bus drivers, supermarket workers are rightly designated the title of \u201ckey worker\u201d, but what compensation for years of being undervalued, underpaid and now at particular risk of exposure to a potentially lethal illness.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"37912254-39d8-4da4-af8f-4d0155124114\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/41BnWrYGD5o?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>So save us the platitudes of coronavirus as the great leveller; abandon this sickly myth that we are all in this together.

That it went viral shows the popular appetite there is not to whitewash our grotesque social inequalities. As the IWGB\u2019s general secretary Jason Moyer-Lee put it in a letter to Jhon\u2019s employers at Golden Brick Pubs: \u201cHistory will look back on this moment, and those who had the means but nevertheless failed to do everything possible to assist and protect the most vulnerable, will be judged harshly.\u201d</p> \n<p>When the pandemic is over, when a vaccine shields us from this cruel disease, the rich will still prosper, while the struggling and insecure will be expected to pay: they already are.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s 1992, and two lowriders walk into a Penthouse Players record release party at the Hollywood Athletic Club. They did not arrive together, but as two of the only Chicanos at the party, they were quickly introduced. Both steeped in the 1990s hip-hop zeitgeist, they bond over music, art and the beloved Los Angeles pastime of custom lowrider cars. Bedazzled in intricately designed, glinting candy paint with wire-spoke wheels, whitewall tires and bouncing hydraulics, a lowrider isn\u2019t just something you own, it\u2019s something you are.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/06/livestreaming-beat-battles-lockdown-skepta-timabaland-self-isolating\">'He dominated me!'

They lived similar yet separate lives until 1992, when their paths collided and their ascension to hip-hop eminence began, explored in detail in the new Netflix documentary LA Originals.</p> <p>\u201cThe world\u2019s kind of small in lowrider culture,\u201d says Cartoon, who was given his nickname in high school because of his animated personality. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what networking was but that\u2019s what I was doing when I met Estevan at a record release party I had done the cover art for. When I found out he was a lowrider too, we instantly connected.\u201d</p> <p>Growing up in south Los Angeles, Cartoon seamlessly transitioned between various creative endeavors. Discovering a preternatural skill for drawing at a young age, his parents \u2013 who owned a lithograph printing company \u2013 wholeheartedly supported his craft, emboldening him to pursue a career in art. What began with pen on paper soon evolved to spray paint on walls, airbrush on T-shirts and prints on paper before finally arriving at ink on skin.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_01QJYDavw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/y_01QJYDavw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>In addition to designing the logos for Cypress Hill and Eminem\u2019s Shady Records, Cartoon has etched the hides of pop culture royalty such as B-Real, Kobe Bryant, Eminem, 50 Cent, Travis Barker, Justin Timberlake, Beyonc\u00e9, Danny Trejo and Snoop Dogg, some of whom are featured in the film. His style became iconic because he was one of the first artists to diverge from the ever-popular flash style of tattoo, wherein a numbered series of traditional designs hung on the wall that patrons picked on the spot. Cartoon\u2019s tattoos were \u2013 and still are \u2013 custom, seminal and distinct. Fusing his Mexican heritage, lowrider aesthetics and hip-hop culture with the fine-line style of tattoo art that was born in California prisons, he quickly found a niche</p> <p>\u201cThe tattoo world is different from any other art form,\u201d says Cartoon. \u201cIn every other style of art, especially graffiti, if you take somebody\u2019s shit, you\u2019re a biter, you stole it. With tattooing, you can borrow anybody\u2019s artwork and put it on as a tattoo because you don\u2019t sign them \u2013 it\u2019s all borrowed, inspired by other cultures and artists and combined with the tattoo artist\u2019s own style.\u201d</p> <p>Though Cartoon\u2019s most well known canvas is skin, one can also marvel at his <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-DjMHKhzPw/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\">latest mural</a> painted on the exterior of the Chicano landmark Casa Vega, a family-owned, historic Mexican restaurant located in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles. Open since 1956, Casa Vega is a local institution that has seen patrons such as Marlon Brando and Quentin Tarantino in its glossy, tufted red booths.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in West LA, Oriol was living a parallel existence. The son of renowned activist, artist and photographer Eriberto Oriol, he was genetically predisposed to living the life of a creative. Though lowrider culture was his passion, he found work as a bouncer for a hip-hop club. It was there he became a friend to a clique of hip-hop pioneers which eventually led him to becoming a tour manager for Cypress Hill and House of Pain</p> <p>Nearing the eve of his launch into the rap touring world, his father gave him a gift that, unbeknown to Estevan at the time, would reroute the trajectory of his life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e46dd0efb09e930e5e3c408aae68a7b4f8c2d008\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e46dd0efb09e930e5e3c408aae68a7b4f8c2d008/0_0_7360_4912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A still from LA Originals.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from LA Originals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe first camera I got was a Minolta 35mm,\u201d Oriol, who also directed the documentary, reflects. \u201cIt was given to me by my dad and was his spare camera. He was also a photographer, but was kind of over photography by that time. He said, \u2018Hey man, I got this extra camera. You\u2019re doing your lowriding stuff and going on tour with House of Pain so you should take pictures of all that.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI started out real slow, taking pictures of my people in the lowrider community, then also of House of Pain,\u201d Oriol continues. \u201cAt first, I felt really uncomfortable bringing out a camera and putting it in people\u2019s faces but after a while I started getting used to it and it became easier. I was the only person taking photos on these tours at the time.\u201d</p> <p>What began as capturing moments for posterity became a full-blown career. Since touring with House of Pain and Cypress Hill nearly 20-years ago, Oriol has become a photography heavyweight, his work often showcasing the gritty microcosms of LA that are diametrically opposed to the Hollywood glamour often projected to the world at large. Additionally, he has directed several music videos making him as much a fixture of the hip-hop community as the rappers themselves.</p> <p>Oriol\u2019s photography portfolio boasts an impressive lineup of athletes, artists, celebrities, and musicians alongside his unpolished, often black-and-white captures of Skid Row\u2019s homeless community as well as Latinx, gang, and tattoo cultures. He has photographed rap deities such as Dr Dre, Cypress Hill, Ice Cube, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, Big Pun, Rick Rubin and the Beastie Boys, as well as the portraits of Al Pacino, Dennis Hopper, Robert De Niro and Floyd Mayweather. Still a lover and champion of film photography, Oriol\u2019s work shows that in Los Angeles, glamour and grit are not mutually exclusive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B54oz5Oh2rG/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

In 2013, Oriol sued clothing retailers H&amp;M and Brandy Melville, which used the image without his permission. According to Oriol, the judge ruled that a hand gesture cannot be trademarked by comparing it to the peace sign. Another finger gesture comes to mind, but the peace sign is the more diplomatic choice for comparison, despite the unfortunate ruling of the case.</p> <p>When Oriol and Cartoon finally merged their creative psyches, a super duo was formed. Though both were successful apart, together they created an empire. After Oriol made Cartoon his first tattoo gun, out of a Walkman motor and a Bic pen, taught to him by a friend who made one in prison, Cartoon\u2019s career flourished.</p> <p>They went on world tours with hip-hop giants, photographing and tattooing them along the way. They established a creative agency called Soul Assassins that was unfortunately shuttered shortly after the market crash in 2008. They partied, they hustled, they traveled, they created, they never stopped lowriding, and now, they\u2019ve made a documentary about it all. One of the most important tenets of their ethos, however, which is scarcely publicized is their community outreach.</p> <p>\u201cWe are always helping out the community, we just don\u2019t publicize it,\u201d Oriol explains. \u201cWe\u2019re not doing it for a pat on the back, we\u2019re doing it more because I have family members who have been homeless and friends and family members that were drug addicts. I donate my time, I donate clothes, I donate money, I donate food to homeless people and mentally ill people. And now also, we give jobs to convicted felons who can\u2019t find work.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing outreach in schools for 20 years also,\u201d Cartoon adds. \u201cWe didn\u2019t show that in the movie, \u2018cause it\u2019s just what we do. We don\u2019t film it too often, you know, but one artist helping another is a powerful thing.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>LA Originals is available on Netflix on 10 April</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Although <em>Parallel Lives</em> is subtitled \u201cFive Victorian Marriages\u201d, of the five couples whose joint biographies make up the subject matter of the book \u2013 Jane Welsh and Thomas Carlyle, Effie Gray and John Ruskin, Harriet Taylor and John Stuart Mill, Catherine Hogarth and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/charlesdickens\">Charles Dickens</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/georgeeliot\">George Eliot</a> (Marian Evans) and George Henry Lewes \u2013 the final pair, Phyllis Rose\u2019s \u201cfavourite\u201d, were in fact one of the most famous unmarried couples of the 19th century. Eliot, who in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/feb/10/100-best-novels-middlemarch-george-eliot\">Middlemarch</a></em> (1878) writes of getting married as \u201cthe beginning of the home epic\u201d, lived for almost 25 years as \u201cMrs Lewes\u201d despite the fact that Lewes\u2019s estrangement but not divorce from his (first) wife Agnes meant they could never legally lay claim to the names they called each other.<br><br>This contradiction \u2013 the \u201cbest\u201d marriage in a book about Victorian marriages not technically being one \u2013 is one Eliot herself would have enjoyed. That famous passage from <em>Middlemarch</em>, which is often read out at weddings, is, in its context, more ambivalent than it seems: the home epic is just as likely to be a story of the \u201cirremediable loss of that complete union\u201d as it is a \u201cgradual conquest\u201d, something the fictional marriages of her own characters often attest to. <em>Parallel Lives</em> suggests that one reason for Eliot and Lewes\u2019s happiness is their position outside the heavily freighted marital structure, which \u201cbears some ineradicable taint\u201d that \u201cconverts the personal relationship between a man and a woman into a political one\u201d. In the years that have elapsed since the book was first published in 1983, marriage has ceased to exclusively confer its dubious privileges on to heterosexual couples, and even at the time of its first publication many activists and theorists alike would have disagreed, as I do, with the idea that marriage transforms the personal into the political, rather than reflects the inseparability of the two.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24753865ad345b8a2c8e8bec510cb2106028ac4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24753865ad345b8a2c8e8bec510cb2106028ac4a/0_0_2560_1536/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Catherine and Charles Dickens \u2026 \u2018They loved each other, for a time.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Catherine and Charles Dickens \u2026 \u2018They loved each other, for a time.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>Yet <em>Parallel Lives</em> remains a remarkably contemporary study that places the matrimonial institution itself at the heart of its scrutiny: all the more surprising, perhaps, that despite its ongoing popularity in the US and its international reputation as a half-forgotten classic, it fell out of print in Britain at the turn of the millennium. The new Daunt edition seeks to remedy that by emphasising its relevance to the 21st century. Introduced by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/sheila-heti\">Sheila Heti</a> and packaged with a blurb from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jia-tolentino\">Jia Tolentino</a> and a reference to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/nora-ephron\">Nora Ephron</a>, this is Victorian biography remodelled for an increasingly autofictional world.</p> <p>Rose, who chose an epigraph from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/roland-barthes\">Roland Barthes</a>, uses discrete episodes in the lives of its subjects to illuminate the broader argument that marital relations are best understood as narratives: marriage is one of the primary stories we have historically chosen to impose on our lives. Her ambition, laid out in the prologue, is to create a \u201cseries of domestic portraits\u201d that function as a counterpart to more familiar histories of the public lives of \u201cgreat men\u201d. Her title references Plutarch\u2019s <em>Lives of the Noble Greeks and Romans</em>, which was hugely popular in the Victorian era and often known as \u201cParallel Lives\u201d. Marriage, for Rose, is where individual questions about a life coalesce with the possibility of public destiny: in moments of decision, \u201cI said yes!\u201d being one of them, \u201ceach of us in the ordinary process of living\u201d is, according to Rose, \u201ca fitful novelist, and the biographer is a literary critic\u201d.<br><br>In the 19th century, marriage was a site of trenchant structural inequality. Until the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2014/aug/11/women-rights-money-timeline-history\">Married Woman\u2019s Property Act of 1870</a>, campaigned for by, among others, Elizabeth Gaskell and Eliot\u2019s close friend Barbara Leigh Smith Bodichon, a married woman legally had no right to property or to money either earned or inherited. She also had no legal claims on her children. At its heart, Rose\u2019s biography seeks to illustrate the damage caused by such a fundamental power imbalance, and to remember acts of resistance such as Jane Carlyle\u2019s posthumous literary revenge \u2013 after her sudden death in 1866, a guilt-ridden Thomas Carlyle wrote <em>Reminscences</em>, which, based on her diary, portrayed him as a neglectful and domineering patriarch \u2013 and Effie Gray\u2019s successful legal manoeuvring out of her unconsummated, miserable marriage to Ruskin.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Catherine bore Charles Dickens 10 children in 15 years: as he became a celebrity, she became increasingly exhausted</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Although it is the life of Jane Carlyle \u2013 returned to in different chapters \u2013 that structures the book, Rose\u2019s argument for the narrative character of matrimony is best articulated in the entangling of life and work in the marriage of Mill and Taylor. Mill, one of the most influential political economic thinkers of the century, met the already married Taylor in 1831. In love with Mill but unwilling to leave her husband and children, a \u201cremarkably stable\u201d triangle was initiated, and persisted until John Taylor\u2019s death in 1849, after which Mill and Harriet could finally marry. Little of Harriet\u2019s work was published under her own name in her lifetime, but after her death in 1858 Mill insisted that she had been as much the author of his work as he had. His claim was met with incredulity and distaste, despite the fact that his essay <em>The Subjection of Women</em> was inspired in large part by Taylor\u2019s first-hand experience of the fact that women were legally obliged to have sex with their husbands \u2013 something enshrined in British law until 1991.</p> <p><br><em>Parallel Lives</em> does not seek to offer a revisionist history of Taylor\u2019s skills but rather suggests that, if Mill was indeed being hyperbolic about her talents, this was not unrelated to the vast imbalance of power within the institution of marriage: \u201cMill seems at times to be apologising for the collective disadvantage of the female sex, assuming the collective guilt of the male.\u201d What Rose finds in Mill and Taylor\u2019s partnership is the importance of imagination. Despite the evidence of those who knew them (the Carlyles and many others disliked Harriet greatly, and disparaged her character and intellect on multiple occasions) Mill and Taylor believed themselves to be happy and liberated, because their shared image of their relationship was that of a marriage of equals. \u201cHappy marriages seem to me those in which the two partners agree on the scenario they are enacting, even if, as was the case with Mr and Mrs Mill, their own idea of their relationship is totally at variance with the facts.\u201d Mill\u2019s autobiography, which has long been considered evidence of the foolishness of his love for Harriet \u2013 not least because of his insistence she was a greater poet than Shelley and the foremost political mind of their generation \u2013 is, read sympathetically, \u201cone of the most touching love stories of the 19th century\u201d. Rose reminds us that such fictionalisation of a partner is far from unusual: \u201cWe all make up the people we love.\u201d<br><br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/17/top-10-books-about-long-marriages\">Top 10 books about long marriages</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The volatile relationship between imagination and power characterises, to some extent, all the marriages in <em>Parallel Lives</em>. Perhaps the saddest is that of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/23/charles-dickens-wife-victorian-asylum\">Charles</a> and Catherine Dickens. Married in her early 20s, Catherine bore her husband 10 children in 15 years: as he became a stratospheric celebrity, she became increasingly exhausted, with most of her household duties taken over by her sister, Georgina. The rest of the story is well known: Dickens, frustrated and bored, embarked on an affair with the young actor Ellen Ternan, and publicly announced his version of the separation in his journal, <em>Household Words</em>. Rose bolsters Catherine\u2019s experiences against the overwhelming tide of Dickens\u2019s imagination: in defiance of his later insistence that his marriage had always been unhappy, she offers evidence that they had, for a time, loved each other. <em>Parallel Lives </em>illuminates the mechanisms by which the stories we tell \u2013 about our own lives as well as those of people long dead \u2013 are structured by our own need for narrative fulfilment, and vice versa. It might not be enough to rescue the Catherine Dickenses of the world, but it teaches us to look at who, in the official marital record, is playing the role of narrator.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Parallel Lives: Five Victorian Marriages by Phyllis Rose is published by Daunt (RRP \u00a310.99)</em>. <em>To buy a copy go to <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/bina-9780349726465.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">guardianbookshop.com.</a> Free UK p&amp;p over \u00a315.</em></p>",

The traffic surges we\u2019re seeing across the sector signal unprecedented demand for news, and our current reader numbers in the US make it clear that trusted, independent journalism resonates with an American audience.</em></p> <p><em>The media sector has some challenges ahead but we\u2019re fortunate to have built a loyal and engaged audience, in large part because we\u2019ve never put up a paywall. We believe that everyone should have access to high-quality journalism whether they can afford it or not, and this crisis proves just how important that mission is.\u201d</em></p> <p><strong>John Mulholland, editor of Guardian US, said:</strong></p> <p><em>\u201cThese extraordinary times are testing the entire news industry. As we tackle the biggest and most complex news story of a generation, journalists have a huge responsibility to keep people adequately informed. Our newsroom approach is to answer the hard questions, offer rigorous analysis, deliver expert opinion on all aspects of the crisis, and provide the facts that matter to Americans. Absolutely central to our coverage is elevating the voices of the most vulnerable communities and focusing on how Covid-19 has different impacts across race, gender and income. Our record traffic suggests our readers value this approach and we believe the strength of our journalism will give way to deeper relationships with them.\u201d</em></p> <p>The record traffic for Guardian US is reflective of global traffic trends for the Guardian. With 2.17 billion page views worldwide, March saw the highest traffic ever in the Guardian\u2019s history.

The flights have been fully paid and </strong><strong>are non-refundable. The car hire and </strong><strong>US hotels are all fully </strong><strong>refundable, except </strong><strong>one, but the motorhome is not.</strong></p> <p><strong>We are due to pay the balance of </strong><strong>motorhome, booked through <a href=\"https://www.authentikcanada.com/holidays\">Authentik Canada</a>, by June. </strong><strong>. </strong><strong>All payments made so far have been on a credit card. I </strong><strong>have full travel insurance, which also covers travel disruption. Now that government travel advice has changed are companies obliged to offer a refund? Or will we be able to claim on</strong><strong> our insurance now?</strong></p> <p>The FCO\u2019s advice against all but essential travel was issued on 17 March, initially for a period of 30 days. Last weekend it extended the advice to an \u201cindefinite\u201d period, so no one knows when normal travel will resume. Given this new advice, the reader could contact his airline and the motorhome company to ask for a refund on the basis that there is no way of knowing whether or not he can travel.</p> <p>As the motorhome company is based in Montreal, it falls under Canada\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.opc.gouv.qc.ca/en/ficav/\">Compensation Fund for Customers of Travel Agents (CFCTA)</a>. Authentik states on its website that customers may be entitled to a refund under CFCTA regulations but it is asking customers to wait until 45 days before travel because of its current volume of enquires. If the airline and motorhome provider both refuse to offer a refund, Steven could try his insurance company. Some insurers will pay out now that the FCO\u2019s advice is for an \u201cindefinite\u201d period \u2013 with the proviso that the claimant has tried their travel provider first (although, unhelpfully, some travel providers, including Authentik, require customers to ask their insurance provider first).</p> <p>The<a href=\"https://www.abi.org.uk/products-and-issues/topics-and-issues/coronavirus-hub/travel-insurance/\"> Association of British Insurers </a>says: \u201cThis decision [to extend the advice against all but essential travel] will allow the majority of policyholders with cancellation or travel disruption cover in place to claim for cancelled trips that were already booked and cannot now go ahead.\u201d Some insurance policies may require claimants to wait until they are within 30 days of travelling.

  "<p>Authorities in Minnesota have pressed charges against a landlord who evicted a tenant during the coronavirus crisis and thus violated a state order forbidding kicking people out of their homes as the pandemic spreads across the US.</p> <p>The move is one of the strongest actions yet taken to guard vulnerable people against the threat of eviction as unemployment in the US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/02/us-unemployment-coronavirus-economy\">soars to levels</a> not seen since the Great Recession in the wake of the economic crisis caused by the virus as widespread shutdowns cover the US.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/31/california-rent-strike-coronavirus-eviction\">'This is about survival': California tenants plan rent strikes as Covid-19 relief falls short</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Numerous cities and states have deployed eviction moratoriums. Among them is Minnesota, one of 15 states and territories to suspend both the enforcement of evictions and the filing of them in court, according to a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vTH8dUIbfnt3X52TrY3dEHQCAm60e5nqo0Rn1rNCf15dPGeXxM9QN9UdxUfEjxwvfTKzbCbZxJMdR7X/pubhtml?urp=gmail_link\">tracker</a> on new eviction policies being maintained by a professor at Columbia University.</p> <p>Minnesota\u2019s attorney general, Keith Ellison, worked with Governor Tim Walz to craft the state\u2019s executive order suspending evictions. Landlords have so far been supportive, including the state\u2019s biggest landlord advocacy group, the Minnesota Multi Housing Association.</p> <p>But last week, in a case that was one of the first of its kind across the country, Ellison\u2019s office pressed charges against a small landlord, Howard Mostad of rural Pine county, for violating the executive order against evictions.</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.ag.state.mn.us/Office/Communications/2020/docs/Mostad_Complaint.pdf\">complaint</a> filed in court, Mostad had advised his tenants, a family of three with a four-year-old daughter, that their lease was ending on 1 April, but as the date approached, they had trouble finding a new place because of the coronavirus pandemic and the state\u2019s \u201cstay-at-home\u201d order.</p> <p>Mostad then allegedly showed up at their door on 2 April, and asked to be let in so he could show the property to a potential buyer. The family refused, saying they feared letting new people into their home, as their daughter has a pre-existing medical condition making her more vulnerable to the virus. Mostad responded by forcing his way in and then removing circuit breakers in the boiler room, leaving the family without electricity, heat or hot water, the complaint says.</p> <p>Ellison said that while he understood many landlords were in a difficult situation, he thought Mostad\u2019s actions were \u201cparticularly heartless\u201d and he hoped the state would be sending a message by pressing charges. He said that forcing people into homeless shelters would increase the risk for public health.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to encourage small business people, including landlords, to seek help when they need it. But understand that by putting people out into the street, what they\u2019re doing is not only hurting a family, but they\u2019re actually exposing all of us to potential transmission,\u201d Ellison told the Guardian.</p> <p>When reached by the Guardian, Mostad, 77, said that the family was not behind on rent, but that he had been planning to sell his farm, including the home where they lived, as business had been tough for several years.</p> <p>In an interview, he lashed out against undocumented immigrants, refugees and Black Lives Matter activists, and what he sees as government overreach in response to the coronavirus outbreak.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening with the coronavirus shutdown is a communist takeover,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Mostad now faces up to $25,000 in fines. Ellison said while his office would continue to enforce the eviction moratorium, he worries about what will happen when the order is lifted, and called for action at the federal level.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to need a way to figure out how to deal with the rent that eventually will come due for people who have been out of work through no fault of their own. We need a societal response to that, we need a national response to that,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Ellison\u2019s fear is shared by Alieza Durana, a writer with the Eviction Lab, a team of researchers and students at Princeton University dedicated to mapping and understanding eviction causes and trends across the country.</p> <p>She described a <a href=\"https://evictionlab.org/covid-eviction-policies/\">patchwork</a> of different approaches across the country.</p> <p>She noted that California had attempted to address the problem Ellison described by creating a six-month window in which tenants will be able to pay back rent. However, like several other states, California\u2019s eviction moratorium also allows for \u201clocal discretion\u201d, meaning cities in different parts of the state could interpret it differently. That, she said, could potentially leave residents in suburban and rural areas without strong tenant-rights organizations more vulnerable.</p> <p>Evictions continue meanwhile, in states such as <a href=\"https://www.al.com/news/2020/03/whether-to-evict-in-pandemic-is-up-to-county-sheriffs-in-alabama.html\">Alabama</a> and Oklahoma, where 1,156 evictions have been filed since 15 March, according to <a href=\"https://openjustice.okpolicy.org/blog/oklahoma-court-tracker/\">Open Justice Oklahoma</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe legal advocates that I\u2019ve been speaking to have become very concerned that if we do not close these loopholes, the court system is going to receive an onslaught of eviction notices once the state of emergency is lifted,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Durana cited a <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2018-report-economic-well-being-us-households-201905.pdf\">survey</a> published by the Federal Reserve last year indicating four in 10 Americans would have difficulty covering an unexpected $400 expense.</p> <p>\u201cSo given that that was true prior to the pandemic, there\u2019s a very real possibility that moving forward, without government intervention, we could see the return of greater numbers of homelessness across the United States, and other types of hardship,\u201d she said.</p>",
  "<p>Like life itself, cooking at home is likely to change radically in the coming months. It will be a sanctuary for some and a chore for others, but in an era of lockdowns, we will all sometimes be frustrated by not having this or that ingredient to hand \u2013 and no longer being able to pop out to get it. How you work around that lack of ingredients may determine how well you eat in 2020. To help, we asked various chefs and expert foodies \u2013 the kind of people who improvise every day \u2013 for their tips on how to best substitute in and swap out key ingredients while still creating delicious meals.</p> <h2>Salt</h2> <p>The simple substitute, reckons Louis Korovilas, the executive head chef at Tavolino in central London, is \u201cdigging out a crushed stock cube from the back of the cupboard\u201d. Alternatively, suggests <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/oct/24/the-chefs-who-are-closing-for-dinner-to-pursue-a-healthier-life\">Stuart Ralston</a>, the chef-owner of Noto and Aizle in Edinburgh: \u201cSoy sauce is a direct replacement that gives better flavour.\u201d Ralston would use soy in everything from stews to, if pushed, a white sauce for fish: \u201cRight now, I can\u2019t think of any broad rule of: \u2018It can\u2019t go in X.\u2019 Go ahead.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"eb8af506ac72b7c6b56991fa12668d0a8d84697d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb8af506ac72b7c6b56991fa12668d0a8d84697d/275_121_1780_3383/526.jpg\" alt=\"Soy sauce\" width=\"526\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A better flavour ... soy sauce.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: donatas1205/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tom Cenci, the chef at the Loyal Tavern in south-east London, flags up salty staple ingredients such as capers, parmesan and anchovies, while Aktar Islam, from Opheem in Birmingham, recommends the brine from tinned pulses: \u201cThere\u2019s a Bajan recipe I do that uses lentils. I never season it, because I just pour the brine in, while cooking the lentils.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/dec/14/cheese-story-really-grated-restaurant-charged-extra-parmesan\">Mitshel Ibrahim</a>, the head chef at Ombra in east London, says: \u201cIf it\u2019s something you\u2019ve been busy with in quarantine, most lacto-fermented vegetables have a good amount of salt. They can be added to stews or sauces if you\u2019re looking for a multilayered addition of acidity, salt and funk.\u201d</p> <p>But do you need salt? \u201cI learned from the chef Olivier Roellinger that spices can create a richer flavour profile,\u201d says Apollonia Poil\u00e2ne, the CEO of the French bakery Poil\u00e2ne. \u201cI never suggest salt and pepper in recipes, but rather spice.\u201d</p> <h2>Butter</h2> <p>\u201cYou can substitute most fats for other fats. You can make biscuits with vegetable or olive oil. Cheaper neutral oils are best. Fancy olive oil would make it a bit funky,\u201d says Ralston.</p> <h2>Lemons</h2> <p>A few drops of vinegar will lend the required acidic edge to sauces and salads, while Ottolenghi lovers should double-check their spice drawers. \u201cIf you\u2019re lucky, you may have some sumac you can substitute,\u201d says Paolo Saba, the executive chef at Madera in central London.</p> <p>Given that oranges, lemons and limes go off fairly quickly in the fridge, Richard De La Cruz, the head chef at Arros QD in central London, recommends freezing the juice in ice cube moulds in the freezer, \u201cready to be used when needed\u201d. Esther Miglio, the chef-owner of OWT in Leeds, zests all her lemon rinds, freezes this citrus snow and uses it \u201cto season as you would salt and pepper. Freeze the zest on baking parchment and, once dry, place into a sealed bag. It\u2019ll last six months.\u201d</p> <h2>Mayonnaise</h2> <p>\u201cUHT soy milk is not just for millennial lattes,\u201d says Alex Claridge from The Wilderness in Birmingham. \u201cIt can be stick-blended into a mayo using vinegar and rapeseed or sunflower oil (125ml soy milk, two teaspoons vinegar, 250ml oil, seasoning). I think I speak for the majority when I say dips are going to be a pivotal part of isolation cuisine and, if you add miso paste, it\u2019s pretty compelling.\u201d</p> <h2>Cooking wine</h2> <p>\u201cYou can use any alcohol to deglaze pans or make a stew. I\u2019ll be saving my wine for drinking, so I may be experimenting heavily with those dusty bottles in the back of the cupboard,\u201d says Sven-Hanson Britt from Oxeye in central London. \u201cI\u2019m 100% confident that \u2018chicken \u00e0 la Baileys\u2019 is going to be delicious.\u201d</p> <p>In braises, stews and ragouts, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/gizzi-erskine\">Gizzi Erskine</a>, the food writer and chef at The Nitery in central London, would replace wine with a <em>gastrique</em>. \u201cIt\u2019s a technique of acidulating caramelised sugar to boost the balance of sweet and sour umami in a dish. I do a shortcut at home of one tablespoon of sugar melted into two tablespoons of vinegar. I use sherry vinegar, but use whatever you have. Reduce that down to about one tablespoon of syrup and add it to the dish. It\u2019s amazing something simple can do so much.\u201d</p> <h2>Flour</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82d94ddf4471ef60fa2d3633362f6faef3e3e0b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82d94ddf4471ef60fa2d3633362f6faef3e3e0b4/0_231_4844_2908/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stale loaf of bread\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Waste not, want not ... bread can be used to make a b\u00e9chamel or to thicken soup.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images/Dorling Kindersley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most baking requires flour. But if you are using it to thicken a soup or a sauce, you have options. \u201cAdding a few slices of potato during cooking helps thicken a stew,\u201d says Ryan Blackburn, the chef at the Old Stamp House in Ambleside, Cumbria. As does rice, says Saba: \u201cGrind it into powder in a food processor and substitute.\u201d</p> <p>Si Toft, the chef-owner at The Dining Room in Abersoch, Gwynedd, has a more 70s suggestion: \u201cI\u2019ll get chucked out of chefs club for this, but Smash is quality. Use it instead of flour to hold fish cakes or thicken a sauce. It\u2019s basically tasteless. Disclaimer: I don\u2019t use Smash at work. I use gluten-free flour, which is just trendy Smash.\u201d</p> <p>For a b\u00e9chamel, says Britt, use \u201cdry bread crusts, biscuits, crackers or anything of that ilk and crush them into a fine powder\u201d, then mix that with butter to create a roux.</p> <p>More generally, do not waste bread, advises Rachel Stockley, the chef at Baraxturi in Ramsbottom, near Bury: \u201cIt can be stretched out as breadcrumbs for topping oven bakes or as croutons to bulk out salads. I like to blend torn stale bread into soups to thicken them, like our garlic soup. It is four main ingredients: chicken stock, a garlic bulb, bread, olive oil.\u201d</p> <h2>Cheese</h2> <p>\u201cIn dire times,\u201d says Claridge, \u201cumami-rich yeast flakes provide a passable substitute for parmesan cheese in sauces, and as a topping.\u201d</p> <h2>Vinegar</h2> <p>Britt recommends retaining and/or repurposing liquid from a jar of something pickled, such as ginger or cornichons: \u201cEven high-acidity apple juice will do a similar job to vinegar in your cooking.\u201d Kombucha fans may be interested to know, says Ibrahim, that, by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/07/pickle-ferment-recipes-six-of-the-best\">using a scoby</a> (a fermentation-starting combination of bacteria and yeast), \u201cyou can quite easily turn an unfinished bottle of wine into vinegar.\u201d</p> <h2>Sugar</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"831c8e0d618fc7d03a4c14f6020baf5b2a7aaf61\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/831c8e0d618fc7d03a4c14f6020baf5b2a7aaf61/356_282_3445_4308/800.jpg\" alt=\"Jar of Honey and honeycomb\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A ready-made replacement ... honey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Groesbeck/UHL/Getty Images/Digital Vision</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou can use maple syrup, honey or golden syrup pretty much anywhere you\u2019d find sugar,\u201d says Ralston. You could also use waste syrup from tinned fruit, intensify sweetness in desserts by adding a pinch of cinnamon (a tip from Lina Stores\u2019 head chef, Masha Rener), or deploy vegetables with a higher sugar content (parsnips, beetroots, carrots, sweet potatoes, courgette) in your baking as a way to build in sweetness. This will take trial and error, however. As Poil\u00e2ne points out: \u201cGenerally, you can halve the sugar content of recipes without affecting their chemical balance.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Rice</strong></h2> <p>\u201cLook for alternatives: ancient grains and pulses such as pearl barley, buckwheat, bulgur wheat, millet and lentils,\u201d advises Irina Georgescu, the author of the cookbook Carpathia.</p> <h2>Fresh garlic</h2> <p>Chefs used to shudder at the very idea of using dried garlic granules. A man made for these febrile times, Toft takes a more pragmatic line: \u201cAt home, where we don\u2019t get through the same quantity, dried garlic is brilliant. Also, I have a bottle of oil I\u2019ve been topping up since about 1997 that\u2019s got a load of leftover garlic cloves in it. I use it when I\u2019m browning meat, rather than messing around with fresh garlic.\u201d (Note, though, that the incorrect preparation and storage of garlic-infused oil can give rise to botulism. Thoroughly research the process online before proceeding.)</p> <h2><strong>Meat</strong></h2> <p>Without getting bogged down in the effectiveness or, in this crisis, the availability of meat substitutes (tofu, jackfruit etc), what you certainly can do with dishes in the cottage-pie-to-ragout sphere is bulk out what meat you have. \u201cYou could go Scottish and stretch ground meat with oats and suet,\u201d says the chef Nina Matsunaga, from the Black Bull in Sedbergh, Cumbria. \u201cOr mince or dice any veg and mix it through.\u201d</p> <p>Toft suggests lengthening bolognese sauce with bread: \u201cI put Marmite through mine at home, because I prefer the flavour over stock cubes, so do that as well. It won\u2019t fool [the renowned Italian chef] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/21/massimo-bottura-feed-the-hungry-food-for-soul\">Massimo Bottura</a>, but it\u2019s tasty and packed with vitamins.\u201d</p> <p>Barley, chickpeas and lentils will do a similar job \u2013 or, says Claridge, go full vegan: \u201cWith the world increasingly dark, it was only a matter of time before you had to summon seitan. Add it to curries and stews. It\u2019s tinned and, I guarantee, avoided most panic-buying lists.\u201d</p> <h2>Pesto</h2> <p>\u201cAt work, I make a pesto every day from blanched kale, parsley stalks, pumpkin seeds and garlic oil. It\u2019s beautiful and basically free,\u201d says Toft. Georgescu is also a kale pesto fan: \u201cThere\u2019s no cheese needed and it can be used on top of soups, pasta, bread and eggs.\u201d</p> <h2>Pasta</h2> <p>The shortage of spaghetti has made the idea of using a spiraliser to craft courgetti or other vegetable noodles less a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/aug/11/why-we-fell-for-clean-eating\">clean eating</a>\u201d fashion statement and more a necessity. If you crave the real thing, says Officina 00\u2019s chef Elia Sebregondi, you can make a rudimentary pasta, such as the tiny, Sugar Puff-shaped cavatelli, with flour and water: \u201cUse some semolina flour, which has a lot more protein and nutritional value.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor a little more deliciousness,\u201d says Britt, \u201cmake some fresh sp\u00e4tzle or eastern European-style hand-cut noodles, which cook like pasta.\u201d You will need eggs and some patience; for a primer, see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/feb/20/how-to-make-perfect-spatzle-noodles-recipe-felicity-cloake\">Felicity Cloake\u2019s How to cook the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/feb/20/how-to-make-perfect-spatzle-noodles-recipe-felicity-cloake\">perfect \u2026</a> on the subject.</p> <h2>Potatoes</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40d438cbb8c32ea75dca478af91fdcd4378400de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40d438cbb8c32ea75dca478af91fdcd4378400de/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jerusalem artichokes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The same comforting texture \u2013 and more flavour ... jerusalem artichokes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Westend61/Getty Images/Westend61</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOther big root vegetables can work as well, such as celeriac or swede, and can often offer better flavour,\u201d says Cenci. Britt, who points out that spuds will keep for months if left in the dark in a sack or other breathable, dry container, agrees: \u201cRoasted jerusalem artichokes, swede boulang\u00e8re or carrot and cauliflower mash all give you that comforting texture and, arguably, have more flavour.\u201d</p> <h2>Stock cubes</h2> <p>\u201cIn a chicken tray bake or a casserole, beer is a great alternative. It often brings more flavour \u2013 certainly richness and sweetness,\u201d says Stockley. Matsunaga takes a similar but alcohol-free approach: \u201cAt home, if we have no fresh stock, we use Marmite, Worcestershire sauce, miso or tomato puree to add umami.\u201d</p> <h2>Eggs</h2> <p>Will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/nov/17/vegan-aquafaba-recipe-bean-water-recipe-food-waste-tom-hunt\">the aquafaba cult</a> now cross over? Chefs love the viscous water that tinned chickpeas sit in and its ability to double as egg whites. \u201cTwo tablespoons equals one egg; a 400g can is the equivalent of six egg whites,\u201d enthuses Ricky Evans, the executive chef at Milroy\u2019s in London. Toft is another convert: \u201cI\u2019m not going to pretend to understand the science, but I do vegan meringues whisked to peaks, 100g of sugar to a tin\u2019s worth of liquid, and they\u2019re pretty good.\u201d</p> <p>Google can provide you with numerous other replacements for eggs in baking, from milk to fruit purees, depending on how you are using them (leavening agent, binding etc). \u201cMost people don\u2019t know you can make a beautiful egg-free cake,\u201d says Roberta d\u2019Elia, the head chef at the meal-delivery company Pasta Evangelists. Use 50ml of milk or 70g of plain yoghurt to replace the moisture one egg would normally impart.</p> <p>Interestingly, adds Ibrahim, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/oct/29/-sp-baking-with-blood-homemade-halloween-treats\">pigs\u2019 blood</a> \u201ccoagulates in a very similar way to eggs\u201d.</p> <h2>Sour cream</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"02f7e9e5c9c94831af4a6e3612cd51e2b0c49cd3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02f7e9e5c9c94831af4a6e3612cd51e2b0c49cd3/916_0_3575_3575/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cashew nuts\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">That\u2019s nuts ... cashews blended with lemon and salt can pass for sour cream.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIn a food processor, blend a handful of cashew nuts, the juice of a lemon, sea salt and a few tablespoons of water until super-smooth. You won\u2019t believe how it resembles sour cream,\u201d says Saba.</p> <h2>Onion</h2> <p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t have onions, I always use bacon. The taste is very similar when you cook it until crispy,\u201d says D\u2019Elia.</p> <h2>Flavour enhancers</h2> <p>If herbs become scarce, spice racks run low and you are out of the usual enhancers (anchovies, soy, Marmite etc), there are novel ways to punch up flavour. \u201cI vouch for celery salt to boost umami in almost anything,\u201d says Erskine. Ben Tish, of Norma in central London, rates brown sauce or ketchup as \u201cconcentrated replacements for wine, vinegar and salt in ragouts and stews.

  "<p>More than 35,000km (21,750 miles) of coastline was always going to be Australia\u2019s strongest advantage in keeping coronavirus at bay, but even so, the speed with which it was used was breathtaking.</p> \n<p>Without warning on Thursday 19 March, the Australian prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/australian-government-moves-to-close-borders-as-new-coronavirus-cases-continue-to-rise\">Scott Morrison, announced</a>: \u201cAustralia is closing its borders to all-non citizens\u201d. The ban was effective from 9pm the next day.</p> \n<p>That left visitors and visa holders stranded mid-journey, or turned around at the border and packed back on to planes, and left hundreds of thousands of Australians scrambling to get home, many of whom remain stuck in countries similarly locked down or without flights home.</p> \n<p>Australia and neighbouring New Zealand, almost unique among anglophone countries, have so far been successful in largely suppressing the spread of Covid-19 within their countries, and in particular, keeping deaths low.</p> \n<p>Australia, with a population of 25 million, has had just over 6,000 infections, and 50 deaths. New Zealand, a country of 5 million people, which closed its borders the day before Australia, has had 1,200 infections and so far only one death from Covid-19.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/deaths-comparison\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Both countries have enacted strict physical distancing regimes, enforced by police. Planes have been grounded, workers have been told to stay home, schools have been closed in some places, and entire industries put into hibernation.</p> \n<p>Across most of both countries, it is unlawful to be outside without the \u201creasonable excuse\u201d of essential shopping, medical care, exercise, or compassionate grounds. In both countries, the majority of confirmed cases have originated overseas. Community transmission remains, by international comparison, low\u2013 less than 10% of all confirmed cases.</p> \n<p>And in both countries, the early decision, and the capability, to enforce a total lockdown of borders has proven crucial, buying valuable time to prepare, and allowing both nations to flatten the trajectory of their Covid-19 infection curves.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have so far avoided the horror scenarios that we have seen overseas, whether it be initially in China in Wuhan, or in New York in the United States, or Italy, or Spain, or even the United Kingdom,\u201d Morrison said this week. \u201cBut we must hold the course. We must lock in these gains.\u201d</p> \n<p>Australia has inherent advantages. If a country were to be designed to withstand a viral pandemic such as Covid-19, it would look very much like Australia: geographically distant, a large island nation with borders than can be locked down, inhabited by a comparatively small population that lives, in the main, in low-density cities.</p> \n<p>Australia is wealthy, too, with a highly developed public health system, and a government sufficiently solvent to be able to turn on the tap of public monies to get its population through the months of lockdown. Legislation for<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/08/mps-pass-130bn-wage-subsidy-as-part-of-australias-road-out-of-coronavirus-crisis\"> $130bn (\u00a365bn) in wage subsidies</a> for those who have lost jobs because of the pandemic was passed by parliament this week, on top of $84bn in economic stimulus promised earlier.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"04fcb605-dc6b-400f-9a32-dea28497dcee\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sMtzWVTPmLI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Australia also has had the advantage of watching the Covid-19 pandemic unfold in other countries. The delay has given it time to prepare its public health system \u2013 additional beds and staff have been readied for the coming peak\u2013 as well as its public. Internal restrictions have also been put in place. Australia\u2019s states have closed their borders to each other for the first time since the Spanish flu outbreak of 1918.</p> \n<p>There have been significant and severe missteps, the most egregious being the decision in March to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/criminal-investigation-launched-ruby-princess-cruise-ship-coronavirus-disaster\">allow the Ruby Princess cruise ship to dock</a> at Circular Quay in Sydney Harbour, allowing more than 2,700 passengers to disembark without testing, despite there being people with Covid-19 infections onboard.</p> \n<p>That ship is now responsible for more than 660 infections \u2013 10% of Australia\u2019s total \u2013 and at least 15 deaths. The New South Wales (NSW) and federal governments have since spent weeks blaming each other and the cruise ship company for the debacle: the decision is now the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/criminal-investigation-launched-ruby-princess-cruise-ship-coronavirus-disaster\">subject of a criminal investigation</a> by police.</p> \n<p>Another misstep was at Sydney airport. Just as physical distancing laws were being imposed across the country, social media videos showed border force officials corralling arriving passengers from all over the world to wait in cramped halls and tight queues.</p> \n<p>Apart from the impact of these failures on infection rates, they have damaged public confidence in the government\u2019s measures. Just as the country, state by state, was being put into lockdown, governments were undermining their own messages to self-isolate to save lives.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/comparison\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>There has been, too, overreaction. In NSW, a man was fined by police for sitting on a park bench and eating a kebab. In Victoria, a learner driver practising with her mother was given a $1,600 fine, later rescinded after a backlash.</p> \n<p>But Australians have, by and large, tolerated the imposition of lockdowns. </p> \n<p>After thousands gathered at Bondi Beach on a warm autumnal Friday evening in March, it was summarily shut down and put under police guard. With occasional defiance, it has remained eerily deserted since.</p> \n<p>Ten days after New Zealand\u2019s centre-left government closed its borders to foreign nationals it introduced some of the toughest lockdown measures in the world. No one had yet died and cases had just passed 100.</p> \n<p>\u201cStay home, save lives,\u201d the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/ardern-thanks-nation-as-new-zealand-adjusts-to-new-normal-of-covid-19-lockdown\">urged her citizens</a>, ordering them to remain in their homes for a month. \u201cThe situation here is moving at pace, and so must we.

But when the moment came \u2013 effective house arrest for the majority of the population \u2013 there was absolute quiet on the streets.</p> \n<p>Despite their reputation for having an independent streak and a benign disdain for authority, New Zealanders have been overwhelmingly compliant with the restrictive measures, with a total of 367 breaches recorded by police. Eager surfers and mountain bikers have caused the most persistent headaches, according to the police commissioner.</p> \n<p>New Zealand is one of the few countries worldwide to pursue an \u201celimination\u201d strategy, and the plan has the backing of the scientific community, many of whom want the country to stay in a version of lockdown until a vaccine can be deployed.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>David Skegg, an emeritus professor of epidemiology at the University of Otago, said: \u201cWe could effectively eliminate the virus over the next few weeks \u2026 we still have a window of opportunity but only if we lift our game quickly.\u201d</p> \n<p>Fellow Otago epidemiologist Prof Michael Baker is one of the key architects behind New Zealand\u2019s coronavirus defence plan.

But cases have been steadily declining, and the prime minister has said she is \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that the strategy is working.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday, New Zealand recorded its lowest number of new cases in a fortnight, one day after testing a record number of people. More people are now recovering from the disease than being infected by it, an \u201cencouraging milestone\u201d, the country\u2019s director general of health said.</p> \n<p>Attention and anticipation is turning to a gradual exit from lockdown in late April. Ardern has said it is likely some regions of the country will remain in total lockdown, while regions with few or no cases will ease into more freedoms. The borders remain closed to foreign nationals, and mandatory quarantining of arrivals is to be introduced today.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have positive signs, not least the fact that we could have had 4,000 cases now, instead of 1,000,\u201d Ardern said.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to get ahead of ourselves.\u201d</p>",

Many of the waters and islands we were visiting had not been surveyed for decades, if ever. <br></p> \n<p>I caught up with the Sunrise at King George\u2019s Island, about 600 miles south of Cape Horn, the southern tip of South America. Home to an airfield, two churches, the research bases of 10 countries and about 500 semi-permanent residents, this international community has often been cast as the last hope of humanity in dystopian novels and films because of its remoteness, collaborative spirit and focus on science.

Veterans of Antarctic exploration had warned me that this location would give me my first taste of how rapidly the region is warming. On the slopes around the bay, there was more bare rock than snow, while the stony beach was so free of ice that it could almost have been Brighton, were it not for the penguins. This was to be expected. Temperatures on the peninsula \u2013 the finger of land that points up from Antarctica towards South America \u2013 have <a href=\"https://discoveringantarctica.org.uk/challenges/sustainability/impacts-of-climate-change/\">risen by about 3C</a> in the past 70 years, one of the fastest increases in the world. <br></p> \n<p>What was more surprising was the number of other vessels bobbing in the bay.<br></p> \n<p>\u201cPeople think Antarctica is isolated. That is a myth,\u201d Marcelo Leppe, the director of Chile\u2019s National Antarctic Institute, had told me when I visited him the previous day in Punta Arenas, the capital of Chile\u2019s southernmost region. \u201cThe changes are so great it is hard to put them in words,\u201d he said. Since Leppe started studying the region in 2002, he had seen more and more visitors, and less and less snow. \u201cI have seen glaciers retreat by 100 metres, and parts of the land become so green that it almost looks like a golf course,\u201d he said. </p> \n<p>In December, monitoring equipment at the Chilean research base on King George Island detected something that worried Leppe even more: black carbon in the air, which came from the Australian bushfires more than 6,200 miles away. Even in tiny quantities, this soot darkens the white landscape, reducing its capacity to reflect sunlight and making it melt faster. \u201cAt least future geologists will find this black layer helpful to identify the year 2020 in their ice cores,\u201d he joked darkly.<br></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6d07815a4bc36bddb1ed1d963fc30259a6de04e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6d07815a4bc36bddb1ed1d963fc30259a6de04e/0_0_8256_6192/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The bridge of the Arctic Sunrise in Discovery Bay, Antarctica.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The bridge of the Arctic Sunrise in Discovery Bay, Antarctica.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abbie Trayler-Smith/Greenpeace</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There will be other clues for the geologists of the future. On 24 December 2019, the Antarctic probably suffered its <a href=\"http://climato.be/cms/index.php?climato=the-2020-melt-season-over-antarctica-as-simulated-by-marv3-10\">worst one-day ice melt</a> since records began, according to analysis by the University of Li\u00e8ge. In February, a mainland record of 18.3C was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/07/antarctica-logs-hottest-temperature-on-record-with-a-reading-of-183c\">registered</a> at the Argentinian base on the tip of the peninsula. Days later, a continental high of 20.75C was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/13/antarctic-temperature-rises-above-20c-first-time-record\">measured</a> at a monitoring station on Seymour Island. On that day, on that island, the Antarctic was hotter than Cape Town.<br></p> \n<p>Close to 70% of the world\u2019s freshwater is locked into Antarctica\u2019s snow and ice. If it all melts, sea levels will rise by more than 50 metres. Long before then, most of human civilisation will have been submerged. As scientists scramble to calculate how long that will take, and politicians dither in their response to the crisis, the tourist industry has spotted an opportunity, offering punters the last chance to see the Antarctic before the continent as we know it disappears. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73e8ac3d7e8deddbaa623feb8ab408821f9858fb\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73e8ac3d7e8deddbaa623feb8ab408821f9858fb/0_0_8256_5504/1000.jpg\" alt=\"King George Island in the Antarctic\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">King George Island in the Antarctic.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian \u00c5slund/Greenpeace</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Chapter 3: Trinity Island<br></h2> \n<h2>Crowds at the end of the world </h2> \n<p>For the first two days, we sailed south in serene conditions, gazing in wonder at the seascape and wildlife.

To ensure that tourists feel like they are journeying through a nearly deserted wilderness, tour operators coordinate schedules and instruct captains to use radar to avoid visual sightings of other vessels. (As our polar guide, Tom Foreman, noted, the impression of solitude would be \u201csomewhat ruined if you see 500 people floating past on another big lump of steel\u201d.) </p> \n<p>If there is something absurd about tour companies expending so much energy on crafting the illusion of solitude, it does at least help avoid overcrowding. Biosecurity is no small matter in the Antarctic. Boots need to be sterilised before setting foot on land to avoid spreading seeds, fungi or viruses. Everyone must keep their distance from wildlife \u2013 five metres from a penguin, 10 metres from a seal, 50 metres from a whale, unless they come to you. And no littering. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4597d553bc45b45e7bde06754fdc303a4b5edcc9\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4597d553bc45b45e7bde06754fdc303a4b5edcc9/0_0_6048_4024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tourists visit Orne Harbour in South Shetlands.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tourists visit Orne Harbour in South Shetlands.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johan Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Over the past five years, Astrid Zafiro has watched the traffic to Antarctica grow. As chief of Argentina\u2019s Admiral Brown base in Paradise Harbour, about 250 miles south-west of King George Island, she considers the rise in tourism as visible as the changes wrought by a warming climate. After guiding us through a penguin colony and up a slope behind the small research facility, Zafiro pointed across the bay at a newly emerged nunatak \u2013 a bare mountain peak sticking out above the ice. Near the nunatak, a massive cruise liner was unloading Chinese tourists in rubber boats. In the distance, we heard a crash as another slab of fractured glacier crashed into the water. \u201cIt is all happening right in front of us \u2013 the bay full of tourists, the ice breaking,\u201d Zafiro said wistfully. </p> \n<p>Zafiro described a feedback loop that does not appear in climate models: the more the Antarctic is threatened by the climate crisis, the more tourists want to visit before it melts away. That means more cruise (and air) miles to the end of the Earth, more carbon dioxide and more global heating. Last-chance-to-see tourism becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. <br></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"697e7f51d28b9c7b5d8878b215d0f2ae19844518\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/697e7f51d28b9c7b5d8878b215d0f2ae19844518/0_0_5926_3943/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An iceberg and the Hurtigruten hybrid expedition cruise ship MS Roald Amundsen on Half Moon island.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cruise ship MS Roald Amundsen.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johan Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>On board the Sunrise, a young German member of the ship\u2019s crew, Carola Rackete, told me about \u201csolastalgia\u201d, the term coined by the philosopher Glenn Albrecht to describe the pre-emptive sense of loss that people feel when witnessing natural beauty in this era of environmental destruction. \u201cYou enjoy it knowing that next time it will be changed beyond recognition.

This south-westernmost island in the South Shetlands, nine miles long by five miles wide, takes the full brunt of the winds and waves that spin around the Shrieking Sixties, the stretch of latitude between 60 and 70 degrees south, which is notorious for howling gales. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d4069ce8c7d123ae36614e6d93b300759cea5b8a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4069ce8c7d123ae36614e6d93b300759cea5b8a/0_0_4501_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A chinstrap penguin colony on Low Island.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A chinstrap penguin colony on Low Island.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian \u00c5slund/Greenpeace</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"bb00bb3d-c012-4fca-8e56-103e2671ef5b\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Low was once home to what was believed to be the biggest and most raucous colony of chinstrap penguins on the continent. Prior to our visit, the last survey of this island had been carried out in 1987, and since then chinstrap populations in other parts of Antarctica had suffered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/11/antarctic-alarm-collapse-chinstrap-penguin-numbers-global-heating\">an alarming 50% decline</a>. We wanted to find out whether that trend held true here. On shore, we joined a team of US biologists from Stony Brook University who had been island-hopping on the other Greenpeace ship, the Esperanza. Their task was simple but enormous: counting penguins. Hundreds of thousands of them.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"38bd630e-c64a-405a-8e8b-87b667a6f7a6\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wVgXtM1FgfY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Avian census-taking starts with satellites. Penguin guano is the only excrement that can be seen from space. Over generations, the projectile poo from tens of thousands of krill-eating birds dyes rock a delicate pink. This makes colony spotting easy, but for more precise calculations, the team of four scientists use drones and artificial intelligence to count nests. Then, armed with handheld clickers, they head out to sample areas to double-check their findings. Each cluster is counted three times in a row to ensure wandering penguins do not evade the census. One member of the team, Noah Strycker, described the process to me as \u201ca Zen-like activity\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2049da4017d28371a25a2443c9263ef33190e67b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2049da4017d28371a25a2443c9263ef33190e67b/0_0_4499_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chinstrap penguins diving into the ocean.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chinstrap penguins diving into the ocean.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian \u00c5slund/Greenpeace</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Chinstraps have a reputation for being one of the noisiest and most aggressive of the penguin species. During courtship, the birds chat up potential mates with loud displays. After separating to gather food, they reunite with ecstatic greetings. If nests are threatened by predators, parents shriek protectively. Scientists have discovered that birds can filter out the background cacophony and focus in on the call of their own family members (the so-called \u201ccocktail party effect\u201d). But this skill becomes less essential as the chinstrap population diminishes, and the boisterous hubbub of the colony grows quieter. </p> \n<p>As we wandered from nest from nest to nest, totting up chicks, the loudest noise was from pubescent chicks nagging their parents for more regurgitated krill, the tiny shrimplike creature that constitutes the chinstrap\u2019s only meal. Scientists believe this dependence on a single food source is one reason why chinstraps populations are plummeting. Krill graze on organisms that grow under the sea ice, so when the ice melts, the krill disappear in turn. By contrast, another species of penguin, the gentoo, is thriving, because it is far less fussy about its diet. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff9931945a439b2592d4893449e4948e692dce63\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff9931945a439b2592d4893449e4948e692dce63/0_0_2902_1934/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chinstrap penguins mate on Low.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chinstrap penguins mate on Low.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abbie Trayler-Smith/Greenpeace</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The population final count is not yet complete, but it is already clear that the chinstraps on Low are just as vulnerable as elsewhere. And it is not only the penguins that are in danger. \u201cSuch a big decline over a short time suggests something is broken in the Southern Ocean ecosystem,\u201d said Strycker.</p> \n<p>It was a sobering thought to sleep on Low amid that shifting climate. Our group may well have been the first in history to camp on the island. The polar guides had to tie the tents to boulders because there was no soil to bang pegs into. The tents withstood a cold night of wind and rain, but there was nothing anyone could do about the smell and the chatter. In the damp darkness, the penguins hunkered down, although they never fell completely silent. Thirty years ago, the noise would have been louder. The quietening of Low was far less soothing than it sounded.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4cd07e3d6fb3a4a92a53a483084585470711fc18\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4cd07e3d6fb3a4a92a53a483084585470711fc18/0_0_4499_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Chinstrap penguin colony on Elephant Island, with the Esperanza in the background.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Chinstrap penguin colony on Elephant Island, with the Greenpeace ship Esperanza in the background.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian \u00c5slund/Greenpeace</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Chapter 5: Hannah Point and Discovery Bay</h2> \n<h2>The continent\u2019s greatest comeback<br></h2> \n<p>Over the next two days, the weather took a turn for the worse. With a storm brewing out at sea, we sheltered in Discovery Bay, an indent on the northern coast of Greenwich Island, waiting for a break in the clouds that refused to come. </p> \n<p>In the sea, the only signs of life were strings of <a href=\"https://www.whoi.edu/know-your-ocean/ocean-topics/polar-research/polar-life/the-watery-world-of-salps/\">salps</a> \u2013 tiny tubes of transparent jelly with pink dots for bellies. As waters warm, these little zooplankton are thriving at the expense of krill, which is bad news for the ocean ecosystem and the climate because they are a lot less nutritious for predators, and they do not appear to play such a major role in helping the ocean absorb carbon dioxide. (Krill are better at this because they graze more on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/07/oceans-demise-the-end-of-the-arctic-as-we-know-it\">phytoplankton</a> \u2013 tiny, plantlike organisms that absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen.) The change is another consequence of the ominous sound we had heard on the hydrophone several days earlier. As the Antarctic melt gets louder, there will be fewer chinstraps and krill, more gentoos and salps, less oxygen, more acid, and, of course, less land ice and more sea water.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"034f5db2c2262e6f1c5a290bdab2ea61f6eaed43\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/034f5db2c2262e6f1c5a290bdab2ea61f6eaed43/0_0_6605_4403/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Discovery Bay In Antarctica.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Discovery Bay in Antarctica.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abbie Trayler-Smith/Greenpeace</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>An increasing number of scientists believe the melting of West Antarctica is so far beyond natural fluctuations that it has become irreversible. In February, a first examination of the underside of the vast Thwaites glacier \u2013 which covers an area similar to that of the UK \u2013 showed extensive erosion by warm water. This and the nearby Pine Island glacier are now losing ice <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/16/thinning-of-antarctic-ice-sheets-spreading-inland-rapidly-study\">five times faster</a> than in the 90s. A collapse of the west Antarctic ice sheet is now a serious concern. </p> \n<p>It might be tempting to think humanity can do nothing right, but the short history of human interaction with the Antarctic suggests we can at least learn from our mistakes and reverse some of the damage we have caused.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"881e807cf199a5b50b86cb1dca4d7c9b260b2d51\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/881e807cf199a5b50b86cb1dca4d7c9b260b2d51/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elephant seals near a gentoo penguin colony on Livingston Island, South Shetlands.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elephant seals near a gentoo penguin colony on Livingston Island, South Shetlands.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian \u00c5slund/Greenpeace</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The stratosphere high above our heads is proof of that. In the 1980s, the world was horrified to discover that certain chemicals had thinned the ozone layer and opened up a vast hole above the Antarctic that was raising cancer risks and disrupting weather systems and ocean currents. Since then, however, international efforts to reduce CFCs and other ozone-depleting chemicals have eased that threat. This year, scientists were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/25/global-efforts-on-ozone-help-reverse-southern-jet-stream-damage\">relieved to find</a> that disruption of southern wind systems has paused and may even be returning towards its natural state. There is a risk that a closed ozone hole will <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/environment/article/2009-12/study-finds-ozone-hole-repair-contributes-global-warming-sea-level-rise/\">trap more heat</a>, but the initial damage is on its way to being repaired. This is also true of wildlife in the region. </p> \n<p>For 4.5bn years, not a single whisper was carried on the winds or the waves of this region. It was only 200 years ago, years after the invention of the steam engine and electric lighting, that humans first caught sight of Antarctica. The explorers who first mapped the continent were lauded as heroes, but carnage often followed in their wake. James Clark Ross \u2013 the British naval officer who discovered the sea now named after him \u2013 knew exactly what would happen to the seals and penguins he saw on his voyage. \u201cHitherto beyond the reach of their persecutors, they have enjoyed a life of tranquillity and security, but will now, no doubt, be made to contribute to the wealth of our country,\u201d he wrote in his diary in 1841.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3292db9d66f5835659005418f94142a3b1f36f49\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3292db9d66f5835659005418f94142a3b1f36f49/0_0_4959_3306/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Whale identification work in Paradise Harbour.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Whale identification work in Paradise Harbour.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abbie Trayler-Smith/Greenpeace</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Over the next 50 years, Britain and the US killed more than a million fur seals for their skins, and enough elephant seals to produce 20,000 tonnes of blubber for oil lamps, cosmetics and soap. In bay after bay, and on island after island, animal populations were almost wiped out. Penguins were boiled down for oil in giant digesters that could squeeze the fat out of 2,000 birds per day. When legal protection for penguins was finally put into place in the early 20th century, it prompted a surge in whaling to make up the shortfall in animal oil and fats. Several species of whale, including the blue, right and sei were hunted close to extinction. Others, such as the humpback, suffered an estimated 90% decline. </p> \n<p>Like seals and penguins before them, whales appeared to be doomed. But unfashionable regulations and often unpopular campaigning have made a difference. Steady increases since the moratorium on commercial whaling that came into effect in 1985 have taken southern hemisphere humpbacks close to their pre-exploitation population of about 80,000, according to the <a href=\"https://iwc.int/status\">International Whaling Commission</a>. The scientists on the Greenpeace ships are helping to track whale populations by collecting vast amounts of acoustic data, such as the communal chatter of a pod of orcas and the thunderous clicks of the sperm whale, the loudest natural sound made by any creature on Earth. Thrillingly, blue whales are also making a comeback. Last month, a British Antarctic Survey mission to South Georgia <a href=\"https://www.bas.ac.uk/blogpost/blue-whale-comeback-at-south-georgia/\">recorded 55</a> in just three weeks. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5eaf31c1d1a04fdbff8ebd2e6390835a27031945\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5eaf31c1d1a04fdbff8ebd2e6390835a27031945/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Humpback whales approach Cuverville Island during whale identification and hydrophone work in the Errera Channel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Humpback whales.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abbie Trayler-Smith/Greenpeace</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For campaigners, the recovery of whales is a much-needed reminder that international cooperation can be effective, protections can work, and our species is capable of undoing the damage we inflicted on the natural world. But nobody is complacent. The actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/may/23/vikings-review-history-channel-game-of-thrones\">Gustaf Skarsg\u00e5rd</a>, who had joined the trip in order to promote conservation to his social media followers, summed it up with a personal comparison. \u201cIt\u2019s like Antarctica is in recovery. I know a thing or two about that,\u201d he said. \u201cA low point has passed but the condition is still fragile. It needs more time or it could slip back again.\u201d </p> \n<p>After the storm finally abated, the Sunrise sailed back to King George Island, from where I would have to take a plane home. The closer we came to the airport, the more cruise ships and scientific vessels we saw. In the 10 days since we had left, summer had taken a visible toll. Hillsides that had been covered in snow were now bare, black rock. The naked Antarctic will never be a tourist draw, but it is a powerful reminder that underneath the Earth\u2019s fragile outer layer of water, ice, earth and vegetation, this is just another rock hurtling through space.</p> \n<h2>Chapter 6: King George Island</h2> \n<h2>An encounter with hope<br></h2> \n<p>Of all the moments during the trip, one stands out \u2013 an encounter in Paradise Harbour that stirred two rare feelings in the age of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/30/anthropocene-epoch-have-we-entered-a-new-phase-of-planetary-history\">Anthropocene</a>: pure unmitigated joy and a nascent sense of hope.<br></p> \n<p>I heard the humpback before I saw it. A ripple, a sigh, then a soft splash behind my back. I turned in time to see the dorsal fin arc languorously out and back into the water just like a fairytale sketch of a sea serpent. The whale was about 30 metres away, and coming towards us. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1431280dd9d1f19748fab049e516b299d1c3e29\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1431280dd9d1f19748fab049e516b299d1c3e29/0_0_4501_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Humpback whale breaches while feeding off the Palmer Archipelago, between Anvers Island and the Antarctic Peninsula. *This picture was taken in 2020 during the Antarctic leg of the Pole to Pole expedition under the Dutch permit number RWS-2019/40813\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A humpback whale off the Palmer Archipelago.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian \u00c5slund/Greenpeace</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>We couldn\u2019t move \u2013 the coxswain had cut the boat\u2019s engine a few minutes earlier in preparation for a hydrophone recording.

It was thrilling. Did the whale realise there was an obstacle in its path? Our small boat would surely be upturned in a collision with a creature that size. </p> \n<p>The whale had something else in mind. After passing just below the surface a few metres from the front of our craft, it turned parallel and so close we could almost reach out and touch it. Then the whale tilted its giant head out of the water and yawned cavernously, revealing a bed-sized tongue and the bristled carpet of its baleen plates. Seconds later, with a flick of its knobbled pectoral fin, it was under the water again. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/looping-video/index.html?poster-image=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2020%2F03%2F27%2FC6.jpg&amp;mp4-video=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2020%2F03%2F27%2FC6__abr900.mp4\" data-alt=\"\u2014\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/looping-video/index.html?poster-image=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2020%2F03%2F27%2FC6.jpg&amp;mp4-video=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2020%2F03%2F27%2FC6__abr900.mp4\">\u2014</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Mouths agape, beaming rapturously, the five of us looked at each other to confirm we had not imagined what we had seen.

In Heinsberg, his team of coronavirus detectives could find scant evidence of the virus being transmitted via the surfaces of door handles, smart phones or other objects.</p> \n<p>Early theories that the virus at the carnival party in Gangelt could have been transmitted through the dishwater in the kitchen turned out to be a red herring: most guests drank their beer from bottles.</p> \n<p>Instead, he said, transmission took place at \u201cevents where people spent a length of time in each others\u2019 close company\u201d, such as apres ski parties in the Austrian resort of Ischgl, the Trompete nightclub in Berlin and a football match in northern Italy.</p> \n<p>\u201cMass events are a perfect opportunity for the virus, as people meet total strangers,\u201d said Niki Popper, a mathematician at Vienna\u2019s Technical University whose team has been developing a simulation that could help governments predict the development of the pandemic more accurately.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Instead of merely multiplying the number of daily cases by a certain factor, Popper\u2019s example tries to account for what he calls the starting point of \u201clocal epidemic networks\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf you have 100 or 200 people spend enough time in a room with a person carrying the virus, then for example 20 might walk out with the new infection and, after a few days\u2019 incubation time, pass it on to their families and workmates, let\u2019s assume 10 more people each. Within a few days, the virus can thus multiply 200 times with only one new incident - and then continue.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>\u2018We shared cups\u2019</strong></h2> \n<p>Large parties played a key role in the pandemic\u2019s rapid expansion not just in central Europe, but also in the US and Australia. New York may now be the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/20/new-york-center-us-coronavirus\">centre</a> of the US outbreak, but the traditional festivities around Mardi Gras is thought to have been a catalyst for a large outbreak in New Orleans.</p> \n<p>On 25 February the entire city, with almost 400,000 residents, and an estimated tourist crowd of 1.4 million people from all over the world were swallowed up in a tide of music, floats, extravagant costumes, cocktails and revelry for the climax of carnival.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91aa7a187b00e473c497628091f28db6dd64eeb1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91aa7a187b00e473c497628091f28db6dd64eeb1/0_400_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People in The French Quarter on the final day of Mardi Gras in New Orleans on 25 February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People in The French Quarter on the final day of Mardi Gras in New Orleans on 25 February.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Anderson/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>As is traditional in this Louisiana city on the Mississippi, gatherings and parades had begun weeks before, from 6 January onwards. Many people flung the doors of their houses open and crammed in friends, family, neighbours, strangers \u2013 all jostling, dancing, hugging, eating and drinking together.</p> \n<p>There were no social restrictions during carnival. Only weeks later, on 20 March did the mayor of New Orleans issue a stay-at-home order for the city, with Louisiana ordering statewide restrictions two days later, closing schools and all non-essential businesses.</p> \n<p>The first death in the city occurred on 13 March, and by 22 March Louisiana had 837 cases, of which 70% were clustered in New Orleans. On 1 April the death toll in the state reached 273.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/deaths-comparison\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p> \u201cMardi Gras was the perfect storm, it provided the perfect conditions for the spread of this virus,\u201d said Rebekah Gee, head of Louisiana State University\u2019s healthcare services division.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe shared cups. We shared each other\u2019s space in the crowds. People were in close contact catching [strings of] beads. It is now clear that people also caught coronavirus,\u201d she added.</p> \n<p> For health authorities that were still trying to track and contain individual infections at this stage of the pandemic, party clusters represented a particular challenge since revellers would often travel from and return to other regions, other countries or even other continents.</p> \n<p>In Australia, for example, at least 30 people including backpackers became infected after attending a crowded dance party at Bondi Beach\u2019s Bucket List pavilion on 15 March. </p> \n<p>The party took place the night before restrictions came into force on gatherings of more than 500 people, during a weekend of mixed messages from the authorities. Australia\u2019s prime minister was urging people not to gather in large numbers, but also saying he would go to a football game.</p> \n<p>Many of those who attended the \u201cBack to Boogie Wonderland \u2013 Tropicana\u201d event, which told people to release their \u201cinner Caribbean dancer\u201d, later retired to local backpacker hostels with dorm rooms and shared facilities.</p> \n<p>The Waverley council area, which encompasses Bondi and its backpacker community, has now become a hotspot for Covid-19, with many of its 140 cases linked to bars, clubs and restaurants, including the Bucket List.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf9799a8171c85575c60eb6e766508660d99b86c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf9799a8171c85575c60eb6e766508660d99b86c/0_107_3200_1921/1000..jpg\" alt=\"A Bondi resident leaves a Covid-19 testing clinic near Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Bondi resident leaves a Covid-19 testing clinic near Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dean Lewins/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Pray-ins and funerals</h2> \n<p>In many countries, partygoers and organisers have found themselves on the receiving end of a backlash. In Australia, the Bucket List\u2019s Facebook page is full of livid comments condemning \u201cidiots\u201d who gathered to party. In Germany, cars with Heinsberg number plates have had their windows smashed and have been jeered as \u201ccorona spreaders\u201d.</p> \n<p>But the novel coronavirus did not require social gatherings to have an overtly hedonistic character to flourish. In the week of 17 to 21 February, around 2,500 worshippers gathered at the Porte Ouverte Christian church in the Bourtzwiller district of Mulhouse, in Alsace, eastern France, for one of the most anticipated events in the evangelical calendar.</p> \n<p>They came from far and wide including from France\u2019s overseas territories and Corsica, for a week of fasting and prayer \u2013 held annually for the last 25 years.</p> \n<p>\u201cDuring the five days, the worshippers greeted each other, pecked each other on the cheeks, and held hands, sometimes while praying during the services,\u201d Nathalie Schnoebelen, spokesperson for the church said afterwards.</p> \n<p>At the time, nobody thought more of it; it would be almost a month before France went into a national lockdown. A small cluster of coronavirus cases had broken out in the unfortunately named Contamines ski resort in the Alps, but most coronavirus cases were still confined to China.</p> \n<p>\u201cContrary to what certain politicians have said, we didn\u2019t ignore the basic rules because at the time there were not any,\u201d Schnoebelen said.</p> \n<p>It was only after the congregation at the Porte Ouverte had dispersed and several worshippers tested positive for the coronavirus that concerns were raised. Among those who tested positive were the church\u2019s main pastor, Samuel Peterschmitt (son of Jean Peterschmitt, who founded the <a href=\"https://porte-ouverte.com/\">Porte Ouverte </a>church in 1966).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ba9786c6-c779-4063-8bf9-1d3009eb7c70\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3qV7R2iYVXg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In total 18 people from the Peterschmitt family tested positive for Covid-19. Samuel Peterschmitt\u2019s son Jonathan admitted that worshippers had been in close confines for a week in \u201cconditions relatively ideal if a virus wants to develop\u201d.</p> \n<p>By the time it had been identified as a cradle for the virus, church worshippers had unwittingly passed it on to others. A nurse who had been at the Porte Ouverte is believed to have originated a cluster that contaminated 250 colleagues at Strasbourg University hospital, where she worked.</p> \n<p>Two retired worshippers returned to their home in the Ajaccio region of the Mediterranean island of Corsica. There are now at least 263 positive cases and 21 deaths on the island.</p> \n<p>A delegation of five church-goers from French Guiana, led by their evangelical pastor Gilles Sax, returned to the French overseas territory on the north-east coast of South America, on 25 February. Sax said he felt ill and was \u201ctrembling like a leaf\u201d as soon as he returned..</p> \n<p>Other worshippers returned to cities and towns across France - Orl\u00e9ans, Besan\u00e7on, Saint-L\u00f4, Belfort, Dijon, M\u00e2con, Brian\u00e7on, Paris. By 8 March, around 100 coronavirus cases had been linked to the church prayer week.</p> \n<p>Today, Mulhouse is one of the worst-hit areas in France with local hospitals overwhelmed by patients with the coronavirus.</p> \n<p>Christophe Lannelongue, <a href=\"https://www.liberation.fr/france/2020/04/08/le-directeur-de-l-ars-du-grand-est-limoge-je-ne-suis-pas-en-colere_1784577\">until yesterday</a> director general of the regional health authority, said: \u201cIt was a kind of atomic bomb that fell on us at the end of February and we didn\u2019t notice it.\u201d</p> \n<p>In Italy, which has recorded the highest number of deaths as a result of the virus, a Champions League football match between Atalanta and Spanish team Valencia on 19 February in Milan has been described as the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/italian-serie-a/story/4081211/how-atalantas-feel-good-champions-league-story-became-a-biological-bomb-for-coronavirus-in-italyspain\">\u201cbiological bomb\u201d</a> that turned the north of the country into the centre of the country\u2019s outbreak.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a734d6440331e456a32675c728bb50d0f5e2857b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a734d6440331e456a32675c728bb50d0f5e2857b/0_58_4379_2630/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fans celebrate as Atalanta score in the match in the San Siro on 19 February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fans celebrate as Atalanta score in the match in the San Siro on 19 February.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kieran McManus/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But scientists like Massimo Galli, the head of the infectious disease unit at the Sacco hospital in Milan, believe the spread is more likely to have accelerated in smaller clusters in the valleys around Bergamo.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe know Covid-19 is particularly efficient at transmitting within familial groups,\u201d Galli told the Guardian. \u201cIn osterias crowded with elderly people, it would have found a perfect environment.\u201d</p> \n<p>A similar gathering that brought together older and younger citizens preceded an outbreak of the virus in Italy\u2019s south-east. On 3 March, hundreds of people gathered to pay their last respects at the funeral in San Marco in Lamis, a small city of 13,000. The 74-year-old man being buried had died after complications of what seemed to be a case of seasonal flu.</p> \n<p>Until that day, there had been seven cases of coronavirus infection in Puglia, the heel of Italy\u2019s boot. The photos of patients in the red zones of northern Italy, and the first fatalities in Lombardy, seemed unimaginable, much like the national lockdown that was extended a few days later across the entire country.</p> \n<p>However, soon after the funeral, the man\u2019s wife, who had just begun mourning the death of her husband, received a call informing her that her husband had tested positive for coronavirus.</p> \n<p>According to Ludovico Vaccaro, head of the public prosecutor\u2019s office in Foggia, \u201ca postmortem revealed the man was infected with Covid-19, but the result came out only after his body was released to the family for the funeral. They should have waited for the result of the test before handing over the man\u2019s body.\u201d</p> \n<p>Authorities said that, a few days earlier, the man had travelled to Cremona, in the north of Italy, to visit his daughter. Upon returning, he began to experience flu-like symptoms.</p> \n<p>According to doctors and investigators, the man had infected his daughter and wife before he died. At the funeral, they then came into contact with dozens of relatives and friends who gave their condolences to the family with handshakes and hugs, opening a gateway for one of the first clusters in southern Italy. As a result, 110 people were quarantined, dozens of whom tested positive for coronavirus. Two have died.</p> \n<p>The prosecutor\u2019s office in Foggia has begun an investigation into what the governor of Puglia has called a \u201ccatastrophic error\u201d. Behind one of the most dramatic cases of the virus\u2019s spread is human error: if doctors had waited for the test results before handing over the body to family members, perhaps dozens of people could have avoided infection.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"04fcb605-dc6b-400f-9a32-dea28497dcee\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sMtzWVTPmLI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>A loop not a curve</strong></h2> \n<p>Thinking of the coronavirus pandemic as a process that can speed up dramatically through human clusters also affects the considerations of policymakers who are plotting a route out of the current lockdown. When governments start to relax the current social distancing measures, can they also afford to allow large social, cultural or religious gatherings to go ahead?</p> \n<p>\u201cThe image of the Covid-19 epidemic as a curve has taken hold in the collective imagination, but my fear is that we are actually dealing with a loop,\u201d said mathematician Popper. \u201cAs soon as restrictions are loosened, there could be new clusters that allow the spread to accelerate again.\u201d</p> \n<p>The story of the pandemic in Vietnam serves as a cautionary tale.</p> \n<p>The south-east Asian country recorded its first cases of coronavirus on 23 January, a development that prompted swift action from officials. Vietnam kept many schools closed following the traditional lunar new year holiday late in January, and banned flights to and from China on 1 February. It also became the first country outside China to introduce a mass quarantine, when, on 12 February, officials isolated villages about 25 miles (40km) from Hanoi that were home to 10,000 people.</p> \n<p>Vietnam had detected no new cases for three weeks when a flight from London touched down at Hanoi\u2019s Noi Bai international airport on 2 March. Among the hundreds of passengers onboard was a 27-year-old Vietnamese woman returning after a trip to attend exclusive fashion week events in Europe. Along with her sister, she had sat among guests at a Gucci show in Milan, and watched Yves Saint Laurent in Paris, documenting her travels on Instagram.</p> \n<p>The woman later told the New York Times that she had flown to Milan on 18 February and that, at the time, \u201cno one was talking about the virus\u201d. She travelled to Paris on 25 February, she added, and said she felt fine when she flew home that week.</p> \n<p>Days after arriving back in Vietnam, she developed a cough and tested positive for coronavirus, becoming the country\u2019s \u201cpatient 17\u201d. As of 7 April, Vietnam has 245 confirmed infections. The effort to trace and contain the virus has to start all over again.</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 9 April 2020. An earlier version said it was the Champions League football match between Bergamo and Valencia on 19 February that was described as a \u201cbiological bomb\u201d. The match, which was played in Milan, was between Atalanta and Valencia. This has been corrected.</p>",
