The warning comes after Germany reported an acceleration in new infections after easing its lockdown, and South Korea, another country that succeeded in limiting infections, saw a new outbreak in nightclubs.</li> \n   <li><strong>Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, denied reports his senior scientific and medical advisers were not consulted on the much-maligned new messaging attached to <strong>his plan </strong></strong>to ease the country\u2019s lockdown as he set out the details in parliament. Amid muddled guidance from ministers on what the new rules actually allow, Johnson insists the public understands his government\u2019s message.</li> \n   <li><strong>Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, announced an easing of the nationwide lockdown</strong>, even as the country reported a record number of new infections. Putin said people in some sectors would return to work, though restrictions on public gatherings would remain in place. </li> \n   <li><strong>Men\u2019s blood has higher levels of an enzyme used by the Sars-CoV-2 virus to infect cells</strong>, the results of a study published in the European Heart Journal show.

It is thought to play a role in how the infection progresses into the lungs.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Afghan capital, Kabul, recorded its worst day for infections, as 161 new cases were reported,</strong> and the health ministry warned transmission would continue to surge across the country.

the virus takes off again,\u201d he said. </p> \n  <p> Governments around the world are struggling with the question of how to reopen their economies while still containing Covid-19. </p> \n  <p>The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told the same briefing that lifting restrictions was \u201ccomplex and difficult\u201d and that the \u201cslow, steady lifting of lockdowns\u201d was

Twenty-two people have died and 378 have recovered from the virus. </p> \n  <p>On Saturday there were almost a thousand new cases announced by the government. The rate of infections has fuelled worries that the relaxed measures have caused the virus to spread further. In what is still technically an election year, criticism of the government has grown more intense.</p> \n  <p>The former president John Mahama, a candidate against Akufo-Addo\u2019s re-election, tweeted on Saturday: \u201cFrom 3,091 to 4,012 #COVID19 cases within 24 hours. Government is certainly failing the people of Ghana.\u201d</p> \n  <p>In the president\u2019s address the following day, he indirectly responded: \u201cI know some political actors would want you to believe that the new numbers represent a failure on our part, do not begrudge them.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The government insists that its fairly robust testing and tracing measures allow it to track the spread with precision and focus restrictions on specific locations rather than entire cities. So far 160,000 tests have been administered in Ghana, one of the highest totals in Africa. </p> \n  <p>Addo said a sharp rise in cases was partly due to a backlog of tests, which had now been cleared. Many recently confirmed cases were not new infections. Clusters of cases were being tightly traced, such as 533 infections at a fish processing factory which he said were all linked to one individual. </p> \n  <p>Health officials in Ghana feel the larger case numbers, among the highest in Africa, are largely a result of its more comprehensive and widespread testing campaign relative to other countries.

He faced some robust criticism from the opposition, but what was missing was any evidence of a backlash from Conservatives. Some Tory backbenchers are reportedly concerned that the lockdown is being allowed to continue for too long. But we did not hear that this afternoon. Partly that might be a function of the new format (there is no \u201cmood of the house\u201d on Zoom, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JGForsyth/status/1258312562095128577\">as James Forsyth pointed out recently)</a>, but maybe they\u2019re just reserving judgment.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson rejected claims that people did not understand his new \u201cStay alert\u201d slogan. </strong>Yesterday <strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong>, the SNP leader and Scottish first minister, said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-to-announce-covid-19-alert-system?page=with:block-5eb80b458f0858b1a810765c#block-5eb80b458f0858b1a810765c\">she did not know what this meant.</a> But when the SNP\u2019s <strong>Chris Law </strong>asked Johnson to explain this, he insisted it was clear. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It will be perfectly obvious to the house what we\u2019re trying to do, and what we\u2019re saying by \u201cStay alert\u201d. What we\u2019re now saying is we\u2019re emphasising, or re-emphasising, the importance of those who cannot work from home going to work, provided their workplaces are Covid secure, provided that they observe the rules of social distancing on public transport, or however they go to work. That is what staying alert means.</p> \n   <p>Staying alert is going to be absolutely vital to our continued success in beating this virus. I think the British public understands exactly what we are trying to do.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In response to another claim that his new guidance was not clear, Johnson said he trusted the British public to apply \u201cgood, solid British common sense\u201d. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/11/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-to-give-more-detail-on-lockdown-changes?page=with:block-5eb9675b8f0846f9cd556449#block-5eb9675b8f0846f9cd556449\">3.59pm.)</a></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson said the Health and Safety Executive would be enforcing the new \u201cCovid secure\u201d guidance for employers, using spot checks.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The Health and Safety Executive [HSE] will be enforcing it and we will be having spot inspections to make sure that businesses are keeping their employees safe, and of course it\u2019ll be open to employees who do not feel safe to raise that, not just with their employers but with the HSE as well.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He hinted that the government would use <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/flushing-is-our-next-weapon-against-covid-19-if-youre-happy-to-have-your-sewage-scrutinised-136844\">sewage testing</a> to monitor for new coronavirus outbreaks.</strong> This is what he seemed to be referring to when he told the Conservative <strong>Robert Courts </strong>that there would be monitoring for local flare-ups.

Blanchard writes:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><strong>A note on scrutiny:</strong> Astonishingly this afternoon\u2019s session will mark the first time Johnson has even made a statement in the Commons on coronavirus, and only the second time he has turned up to make a statement on anything at all since this year. We\u2019re also still waiting for his first appearance before the Commons liaison committee, eight and a half months into his premiership. More pressingly the PM has refused to give a press conference or a media interview for the past 11 days, and has managed just one presser since March 25, having been off sick for much of April. Aides say he will only take pre-recorded questions from the public tonight.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb909aa8f08464cd4297daa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-11T08:18:45.377Z\">9.18am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Boris Johnson has been taking what has become his daily morning walk around St James\u2019s Park.

In employment terms, NSW would see 279,550 jobs return over the three stages, and Victoria 216,085 jobs.</p> <p>While Morrison has been careful not to inflame relations within the national cabinet, a number of Victorian Liberals have used the resumption of federal parliament to blast Daniel Andrews for hastening slowly on dismantling restrictions.</p> <p>With Australia moving to a period of easing restrictions, concern about the threat of the virus increased in this week\u2019s Guardian Essential survey. 49% of respondents say they are quite concerned, compared with 46% last week. But people remain satisfied with both federal and state government handling of the crisis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/06/essential-poll-two-thirds-of-australians-back-aged-care-homes-on-covid-19-visitor-bans\">Essential poll: two-thirds of Australians back aged-care homes on Covid-19 visitor bans</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The latest poll of 1,067 respondents shows a majority of Australians are comfortable with the broad direction set by governments last Friday. Only a quarter of respondents now oppose an easing of the social distancing rules, compared with half the sample at the end of April.</p> <p>But the survey also points to nervousness about the consequences. It shows 77% of people would support restricting travel to places if there are new clusters of infections. More than half of respondents, 67%, would also support increasing fines for people found to be breaching remaining restrictions, and 63% would support a return to restrictions enforcing physical distancing and closing workplaces nationwide if there was a new surge of cases.</p> <p>Respondents over the age of 55 are more likely to support a snapback to restrictions than the cohort between 18 and 34.</p> <p>Australians also remain cautious about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/26/australias-coronavirus-tracing-app-set-to-launch-today-despite-lingering-privacy-concerns\">the CovidSafe app</a>, which is part of the government\u2019s surveillance toolkit to trace recent contacts in the event people become infected with coronavirus. There are now more than five million registered users. Only 38% of the sample would support making downloading the app mandatory in the event there are new clusters of infections.</p> <p>While just over half the sample (55%) agrees the CovidSafe app would help limit the spread of Covid-19, less than half the group surveyed agrees that they are confident the government will adequately protect any data it collects (45%) and not misuse that data (44%). Just under half the sample, 47%, express concern about the security of their personal data if they download the app.</p> <p>A majority of the sample would favour a reduction in the number of temporary migrant worker visas permitted in Australia after the Covid-19 outbreak. The shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, last week called for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/05/penny-wong-defends-kristina-keneally-on-qa-over-call-for-cut-in-temporary-migration\">a reduction in temporary migration post-pandemic.</a></p> <p>Expanding on a warning in January about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/30/new-underclass-labor-warns-on-australias-reliance-on-short-term-migration\">the risk of an underclass</a>, Keneally wrote in a recent opinion piece Australia\u2019s \u201cincreasing reliance\u201d on \u201ccheap supply of overseas, temporary labour\u201d undercuts wages \u201cfor Australian workers and takes jobs Australians could do\u201d.</p> <p>Keneally\u2019s position is supported by 67% of respondents. Women, Coalition voters, voters over the age of 55, and voters who support someone other than the major parties were more favourably disposed to the idea than men, voters under 34, and Greens supporters.</p> <p>Australians have mixed views about temporary migration. More than half the sample, 57%, say temporary migrants support the economy by spending their money in Australia, but 54% say employers should hire Australian citizens where they can, even if they\u2019re not as skilled as candidates who are temporary migrants.</p> <p>More than half, 52%, say they agree with the statement that if temporary migrants pay the same taxes as Australian citizens, they should be entitled to the same government support. Just under half, 48%, say without temporary migrants, Australia would face skill shortages, and 41% say Australia would be better off with fewer temporary migrants.</p> <p>The error margin in the survey is plus or minus 3%.</p>",

  "<p>My father, George Wedell, has died aged 92, following a stroke and pneumonia, in Manchester Royal Infirmary, just a stone\u2019s throw from the flat in Nelson Street where he and my mother, Rosemarie, lived following their marriage in 1948. It brought a lifetime\u2019s connection to Manchester and its university to a close.</p> <p>As professor of adult education at Manchester University, 1964-75, he developed a practical and scholarly field of research within the disciplines of education and broadcasting. Groundbreaking research resulted in books, including Broadcasting and Public Policy (1968)<em> </em>and Broadcasting in the Third World<em> </em>(1977)<em>, </em>that<em> </em>influenced higher education, social change, and broadcasting policy and regulation worldwide.</p> <p>In 1973, he \u201cchose to work for rather than<em> </em>at the European commission\u201d, he said, heading up the division for employment and retraining. This commitment shaped the second half of his life. Returning to Manchester University in 1982 as professor of communications policy, he established the European Institute for the Media, funded by the European Cultural Foundation. Research focused on the role of media particularly during the democratisation of former communist countries in the 1990s. These achievements brought him several distinguished European awards.</p> <p>He was born Eberhard Artur Otto Georg Wedell in D\u00fcsseldorf. His father, Hans Wedell, was a lawyer \u2013 and the son of Rabbi Abraham Wedell; his mother \u2013 was Gertrud Bonhoeffer \u2013 a cousin of the theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who was my father\u2019s godfather. This dual heritage laid the foundations for George\u2019s commitment to faith and social responsibility. In 1939, the Wedells found refuge in the UK while the Bonhoeffers joined the frontline of resistance that culminated in the assassination attempt of 20 July 1944 on Adolf Hitler, and their subsequent execution.</p> <p>As a child refugee, often regarded as an enemy alien, my father faced integration into his host country with fortitude. Educated at Cranbrook school in Kent, he received a scholarship to the London School of Economics, where he studied economics and international relations. After their marriage, he and Rosemarie (nee Winckler), lived briefly in Manchester, where Rosemarie was employed as a youth worker. From 1950, George worked for eight years in the Ministry of Education in London and for six years as secretary of the newly created Independent Television Authority, before in 1964 my parents returned to Manchester, now with three sons and a daughter. </p> <p>Over the last decade of his life he accepted the civic invitation to D\u00fcsseldorf\u2019s annual commemoration of Reichspogromnacht (Kristallnacht), and in later years I accompanied him. Our journey together to the city of his birth was a way of acknowledging a trauma too difficult to speak about.</p> <p>Rosemarie died in 2010. My father is survived by his children and four grandchildren, and his brother, Klaus.</p>",
  "<p><em> </em>When Sunil Gupta agreed to attend an HIV event in Delhi in 2009, he wasn\u2019t expecting to meet his future husband. \u201cI was diagnosed with HIV in 1995, and later became an activist. That\u2019s why I was going,\u201d he says. Sunil was attracted to Charan Singh the moment he saw him when they shared a ride in a lift. \u201cI tried to get his attention by asking where the toilets were. It was a common chat-up line in London.\u201d But Charan was none the wiser. \u201cI had no idea what the reference meant,\u201d he laughs.</p> <p>While Charan was born and brought up in India, Sunil\u2019s parents had left the country when he was young. \u201cI had grown up as a gay man in Canada and London, so I had a different set of experiences and social norms,\u201d he explains. \u201cIn 2003, I\u2019d chosen to go back to Delhi to see what it was like to work and live there.\u201d He found the city heavily segregated by class and caste.</p> <p>When they met, Charan was a social worker living with his family, who knew he was gay. \u201cBut they did not really understand the concept of men living together as partners.\u201d</p> <p>Despite coming from opposite worlds, the pair exchanged numbers during the event. A few days after the conference, Charan visited Sunil at his home. \u201cHe lived in this posh neighbourhood alone and I was so nervous,\u201d he says. \u201cHe was a photographer and I knew nothing about art.\u201d</p> <p>After the first meeting the pair began to date casually, visiting juice bars and local restaurants. \u201cI could not afford to go to the same places as Sunil,\u201d laughs Charan. \u201cSo we had to compromise a bit.\u201d</p> <p>Sunil says he was attracted to Charan\u2019s good nature: \u201cHe was very sexy but also very honest and good. I just found him very easy to be around.\u201d Charan says they were both curious about each other\u2019s lives: \u201cHe had had this completely different life as a gay man in the west, which was fascinating.\u201d</p> <p>Although Sunil was HIV positive, this was never an issue for Charan. \u201cAs a social worker, I had a lot of experience working with people who had HIV. Lots of my friends were positive, too.\u201d</p> <p>But same-sex relationships in India at the time were not easy. \u201cYou could never get a lease together and if I went to hospital, Charan couldn\u2019t visit me,\u201d says Sunil.</p> <p>In 2011, the pair were able to get married in Toronto, with support from two galleries that Sunil was working with on a photography project. \u201cAs a single man with no money, there was no way I\u2019d get a visa,\u201d says Charan. \u201cBut the gallery invited me over with Sunil, so I was able to go.\u201d</p> <p>After the wedding, Charan applied for a UK spouse visa, which would mean the couple could live together as a married couple in England. \u201cWhen I was applying, I explained I was married and they kept asking my wife\u2019s name. I told them about Sunil and I think they thought my English was bad,\u201d says Charan. \u201cThe man on the desk was in shock when he finally realised I was married to a man.\u201d</p> <p>They moved to London together in 2012. While Sunil continued his photography career, Charan also decided to explore the arts. He completed an MA in photography, and the couple have since worked on projects together. In 2016, they created a series of portraits of LGBT people in Delhi, which was turned into a <a href=\"https://www.sunilgupta.net/delhi-communities-of-belonging.html\">book</a>.</p> <p>Ultimately, the couple believe it is their differences and shared passions that have kept them together for so long. \u201cWe challenge each other every day, and we complement and learn from each other,\u201d says Charan. \u201cWhat started as something not very promising due to our different backgrounds became so much more,\u201d says Sunil. \u201cI am so glad we gave it the time.\u201d</p> <p><em>Want to share your story?

Here\u2019s our roundup of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2020/may/04/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week\"> your comments and photos</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2020/apr/27/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week\"> </a>from the last week.</p> <p>First, Hilary Mantel\u2019s The Assassination of Margaret Thatcher has provided welcome distraction for <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16300334\">MaggieMaggieB</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I was finding it difficult to concentrate on a book as I was worrying about my son and daughter and missing my grandsons so I thought that I would try short stories. They were just what was needed. I found them easy to read and the title story turned out to be surprisingly cosy. The other tales were very varied and well observed, ranging from an account of two bored children\u2019s antics during a hot summer to a vampire story!</p> </blockquote> <p>Elmore Leonard\u2019s 52 Pickup has been ideal lockdown reading for <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2565880\">RickLondon</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This week I read an early Elmore Leonard, 52 Pickup; and if his absolute mastery of plotting was not totally refined by this point, his brilliant dialogue and characterisation was much in evidence. A perfect lockdown read. It\u2019s been a while Elmore, but I\u2019m not going to wait so long for the next fix.</p> </blockquote> <p>Alice Munro has been keeping <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13505124\">lonelybloomer</a> going:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have also taken to reading an Munro story every morning and I went through a couple of her collections this way. Very enjoyable (I love Munro!).</p> </blockquote> <p>Peter Robinson\u2019s short story anthology Not Safe After Dark has provoked a powerful reaction from <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12168095\">PatLux</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One of the stories, Memory Lane, had a strong effect on me. Its setting is a care home and it was ironic to read it as Brexitland went all nostalgic about VE day at the same time as allowing so many elderly people to needlessly die alone in care homes. In a 12-page story much to reflect on about our current times and about the lives and experiences of war \u201cheroes\u201d. Art and life, life and art.</p> </blockquote> <p>Wild Women is a \u201cfine collection of tales by female travellers, put together by Mariella Frostrup,\u201d says <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/11774763\">laidbackviews</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>She brings us selected highlights from 50 authors, taking us to all parts of the globe and using pretty much every means of transport. There\u2019s some old favourites in there, and some new ones to discover. I find myself making lists, starting with a short one of writers that could have been there; and ending up with another of writers of whom I\u2019d like to read more. On the former I\u2019d have Elly Beinhorn and Annemarie Schwarzenbach from the golden age, and Anna Badkhen and Kate Harris from the here and now. But it is the deliciously named Aloha Wanderwell who heads the second list, having enticed me in and left me keen to see if she lived up to her destiny.</p> </blockquote> <p>James Baldwin\u2019s If Beale Street Could Talk has remained with <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16887671\">booklooker </a>for a long time:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What is the magic phrase again? \u201cYou are too young for this book!\u201d \u2013 from my (much older) sister who was fencing off my query what it was about. So this is how I came to read James Baldwin\u2019s If Beale Street Could Talk at 12 (ish): stealing it from its place on the shelf at opportune moments. I suppose I was too young for the book, as with many others that were all the more attractive for being forbidden ... Please do tell me I am not the only one who sneaked reads from an early age! Both love story and police brutality impressed me very much at the time. I also remember very vivid descriptions of what racism feels like on the body - and how you can be forced to view yourself as others do, momentarily.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve finished The Mystery Of A Hansom Cab by Fergus Hume,\u201d says <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13472965\">SydneyH</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A nineteenth century \u201csensation\u201d novel, in which a man is murdered in the back of the titular vehicle. The text is justifiably best known for the astonishing number of copies sold, though it is also noted as an early work of detective fiction and Australian literature. I think it is also an inspiration for people considering self-publishing. I\u2019m particularly pleased to discover that a parody was written titled The Mystery of a Wheelbarrow.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cI can really recommend English Monsters by James Scudamore,\u201d says <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13072920\">bindithecat</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I picked it up knowing nothing about the book or its author and was immediately engrossed as soon as I had started. To begin with it\u2019s about a 10 year old boy living on a ramshackle farm in the English countryside with his eccentric grandparents while his parents are expats in Mexico. At the age of 11 or 12 he is sent away to a local boarding school where the usual sadistic masters rule. He falls in with a group of friends and they more or less support each other and keep in touch into adulthood \u2026 Although the subject matter may sound depressing, it is a surprisingly funny book, especially the bits about the boy\u2019s grandfather.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3712670\">tiojo </a>compares two masterpieces, Graham Greene\u2019s The Heart Of The Matter and Joseph Conrad\u2019s Lord Jim:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In both books the main character faces a moral dilemma and in both the author has chosen an exotic colonial location in which the dilemma plays out. Also in both, the authors have managed to gain the reader\u2019s sympathy for their flawed heroes and their moral struggles. Both of them cloak their exploration of morals in a more expansive tale - Conrad with his adventures on the high seas, Greene a more subtle story of wartime colonial intrigue. And for both they draw on their own personal experience \u2013 Conrad as a seaman, Greene from his time spent in west Africa as a young man. In some ways they might be seen as giving hope to the aspiring writer. The moral dilemmas they explore are ones that are faced by many people in their everyday experience. They are using their own life experience to put them into a setting in which the tale can be told. But both of them are master craftsmen. Both writers of high quality.</p> </blockquote> <p>High quality, indeed.</p> <h2><strong>Interesting links about books and reading</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p>Light at the end of the tunnel. <a href=\"https://newsletter.shakespeareandcompany.com/t/ViewEmail/y/33C31EF448B88A44/B8C1791055D90AA13D3F7F9A22A6E02E\">Shakespeare &amp; Company are reopening in Paris</a> and their online store is back in operation.</p></li> <li><p>Less good news: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/21/ernest-hemingway-lookalike-contest\">the annual Hemingway lookalike competition</a> has been <a href=\"https://www.mhpbooks.com/hemingway-look-alike-competition-cancelled/\">postponed</a>.</p></li> <li><p>When James Baldwin <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/books/second-read/when-james-baldwin-wrote-about-the-atlanta-child-murders\">wrote about the Atlanta child murders</a>.</p></li> <li><p>The New York Public library have created a <a href=\"https://www.nypl.org/blog/2020/05/01/missing-sounds-of-new-york\">sounds of New York album</a>.</p></li> <li><p>Some \u201csuperbly entertaining\u201d romantic letters, written in the second world war and discovered by chance, <a href=\"https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/love-in-the-blitz-eileen-alexander-review-laura-thompson/\">are creating a real stir</a>.</p></li> <li><p>The New York Times provide a guide to reading <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/04/arts/best-stephen-king-books.html?campaign_id=69&amp;emc=edit_bk_20200505&amp;instance_id=18237&amp;nl=books&amp;regi_id=41740674&amp;segment_id=26652&amp;te=1&amp;user_id=de58d5d545b07b9e09939e21818c932a\">the great Stephen King</a>.</p></li> </ul> <p>If you\u2019re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/guardianbooks/\">#GuardianBooks</a>, and we\u2019ll include a selection in this blog.

Trade wars with China, Mexico, Canada and Europe knocked the wind out of steel wheels and soybean prices. Workers at John Deere, the huge tractor builder, were getting pink slips in Davenport. Ethanol plants were idled. Farmers in north-west Iowa\u2019s Sioux county, where Trump took 90% of the vote, said last fall they would not vote for him again. The Iowa Corn Growers proclaimed they were \u201cfed up\u201d after Trump\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency allowed 31 petroleum refineries to shun ethanol blending requirements. Ethanol comes from corn. Corn is a religious totem in these parts.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s approval ratings sank underwater in key midwestern swing states he won: Michigan, Wisconsin and Iowa. Any number of polls showed Trump and Joe Biden in a dead heat in about a dozen purple states, or with Biden in a comfortable lead. Bluster and blunder were coming home to roost.</p> <p>Then the pandemic that Trump ignored hit and the bottom dropped out.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When 30 million people can\u2019t get through to the unemployment system, and half of them lose their health insurance by fall, incumbents should cover their flanks</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Corn prices dived 19% since January. Meatpacking plants are exploding with the coronavirus \u2013 60% of the pork plant workers in Perry, Iowa, are infected. The sheriff for Waterloo, Iowa, said he wanted to stomp a boot on Tyson\u2019s plant. The mayor of Sioux Falls argued with the South Dakota governor to shut down a Smithfield pork facility overrun with the virus. About 65% of people polled think folks should stay home and not dine in at the restaurant buffet.

Iowa is on the pink side of purple but clearly is in play if the Democrats don\u2019t just fly over again as Clinton did. The Iowa Republican senator Joni Ernst has an approval rating near 37% for joining at the cranium with Trump while he routed ag markets.

Hogs are backed up when one of the huge, consolidated slaughterhouses goes down for lack of healthy help. Producers are left to shoot them and bury them. People in nice SUVs line up for free food. It makes everyone nauseous. Everyday people can\u2019t understand why NBA players can get tested but packinghouse workers ordered to keep the pork loins rolling can\u2019t. Rural communities prone to vote Republican live under a cloud of fear that virus from immigrant workers will spread to them \u2013 that the health of your neighbor is in fact your health. Immigrants become human, and their treatment is realized as shameful. We\u2019re waking up, all right. When 30 million people can\u2019t get through to the unemployment system, and half of them lose their health insurance by fall, incumbents should cover their flanks.</p> <p>Polls show that in the upper midwest, blue urban voters are more motivated to vote than rural red voters by fair margins.

Yet they can trap women with abusive partners. Over recent weeks, there has been a dramatic jump in reported incidences of domestic violence in many countries. In some countries, the number of women calling support services has doubled.</p> <p>Humanitarian settings already stressed by years of war and poverty will not be any different, except that often there are few places to report the abuse or to seek shelter so that women and their children can stay safe.</p> <p>If we are serious about eradicating this virus, we must promote and protect the health and rights of women, for their own wellbeing and so that they can continue to promote and protect the health of others.</p> <p>That is why the UN\u2019s global humanitarian response plan to fight Covid-19 sets out specific actions to achieve this in the most vulnerable settings.</p> <p>This plan is already helping install handwashing facilities that are safe for women and girls to access; delivering medical equipment and supplies, including to address women\u2019s health; and getting aid workers and supplies to where they are needed most.</p> <p>The plan recognises the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on women and girls.

A week after being transferred from Aegean islands on the frontline of the refugee crisis, the teenagers are among a group of 52 vulnerable migrants, including several minors, who will fly out of Athens to be reunited with relatives in the UK.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/10/exclusive-family-reunion-rescue-flight-to-leave-athens-for-uk\">Family reunion rescue flight to bring vulnerable migrants from Athens to UK</a> </p> </aside>  <p>How will they feel when they board the plane? \u201cI think I will say: \u2018Finally, at last,\u2019\u201d says Walid, who tells of how he crawled across the border from Syria into Turkey before making his way to Izmir, where he was smuggled by boat to the Greek isle of Samos \u2013 a journey that cost his family $4,000 (\u00a33,235).</p> <p>\u201cIn Syria, there are bombs and guns, a lot of people die every day. In England there is Baker Street and Sherlock Holmes. It\u2019s a very beautiful place. And my brother Ahmed is there. The first thing I want to see is Big Ben. I know I will be happy.\u201d</p> <p>It will be a different world to Samos, where his home \u2013 a camp 11 times overcapacity \u2013 was overrun with rats \u201cas big as cats\u201d and was \u201cdirty, dirty, dirty,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Mustafa is far more reticent. He says his mother encouraged him to leave Burco, the Somali city where he grew up, when he was 15. Getting to Greece took seven months, after he flew out of Somalia to Kenya and from there on to Turkey. For almost two years he has languished on Lesbos. Part of that time was spent in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/09/moria-refugee-camp-doctors-story-lesbos-greece\">appalling conditions of Moria</a>, Europe\u2019s biggest refugee camp, where lone children live in designated areas.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve learned to live alone. I\u2019ve learned to be alone, but all the time I think about my family,\u201d he says. \u201cI had to leave because I was afraid for my life. I haven\u2019t seen my family for two years.</p> <p>\u201cI want to speak with my mother and brothers and sisters. I don\u2019t know where they are but I hope my uncle can help. He lives in London. I don\u2019t know what he does but I am hoping. I need my family, I want to see them.\u201d</p> <p>The teenagers\u2019 resettlement comes in the wake of a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/historic-uk-greece-migration-action-plan-signed\">joint action plan</a> between Greece and the UK on migration. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very comprehensive agreement,\u201d says Giorgos Koumoutsakos, Athens\u2019 alternate minister for migration policy. \u201cIt touches upon all the dimensions of the migration phenomenon including unaccompanied children, the most vulnerable migrants in this country.\u201d</p> <p>Thousands of lone children reach Europe each year, and an estimated 5,600 are in Greece. Of those, about 300 are kept in police cells and detention centres in what authorities call \u201cprotective custody\u201d but which Human Rights Watch has slammed as an \u201cabusive practice\u201d that exposes minors to brutal treatment in unsanitary and degrading conditions.</p> <p>Between 30-40% of the minors have family members in EU states, according to the UN refugee agency (UNHCR). Most are in their mid-teens when they arrive in Europe. Many became separated from their parents in the chaos of war.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed out on a lot of school,\u201d says Mustafa, who as a young boy dreamed of becoming a pilot. \u201cI like computers, too. Maybe like him [Walid] I will go into IT,\u201d adds the Somali, who speaks with his Syrian roommate in Arabic picked up watching films.</p> <p>With Greece hosting almost 100,000 migrants and refugees in facilities nationwide, and facing intense criticism over vastly congested camps, the centre-right government has been pushing for relocation of the minors to other European countries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25af401dd16475fd1aaf0dc9b6b5964ff278e8e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25af401dd16475fd1aaf0dc9b6b5964ff278e8e7/119_340_2857_1714/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The UK ambassador to Greece, Kate Smith (C), and Greece\u2019s alternate minister of immigration policy, Giorgos Koumoutsakos, await the refugees at Athens international airport\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The UK ambassador to Greece, Kate Smith (C), and Greece\u2019s alternate minister of immigration policy, Giorgos Koumoutsakos, await the refugees at Athens international airport.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Initial pleas fell on deaf ears, says the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who has spoken of \u201cscars of the soul [that] are not easy to heal\u201d. From March, 10 EU countries have agreed to take 1,600 children and teenagers under a scheme to help relieve reception centres, with the first leaving for Luxembourg last month.</p> <p>\u201cOur [EU] partners were not ready to give their assistance or their solidarity on this matter, but we insisted and did a lot of back-channel work explaining why it was so necessary,\u201d Koumoutsakos said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very sensitive issue, politically and socially.\u201d</p> <p>All agree that speed is of the essence. Hostels, shelters and foster family care are in short supply. The longer the children remain in the camps, the greater the risks, such as sexual abuse or falling into the hands of criminals.</p> <p>\u201cFamily reunification procedures are cumbersome, they take too much time and are often implemented in a restrictive way,\u201d says Philippe Leclerc, the UNHCR\u2019s representative in Greece.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very important that these procedures are accelerated. On average it take nine months for a positive decision to be reached. Children who might not be traumatised when they arrive here can become very traumatised living in overcrowded camps, in such appalling conditions, for so long.\u201d</p> <p>The coronavirus pandemic has added a layer of complexity that nobody was prepared for. Plans to move up to 2,000 men, women and children from squalid facilities in the Aegean have been substantially delayed, with the migrants having to be checked for Covid-19 in addition to other tests.</p> <p>On Monday, Koumoutsakos will be at the airport with the British ambassador to Greece, Kate Smith, to see off the child migrants. And just as in April, when 12 boys and girls departed for Luxembourg, he will give each one a small bag of gifts, including a notebook with a handwritten message wishing them \u201chappiness and good fortune\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>A Syrian man has been found dead in a Glasgow guesthouse after outreach workers raised significant concerns about the spiralling mental distress of hundreds of asylum seekers who were moved en masse into hotels at the beginning of lockdown.</p> \n<p>The man, who was 30 and had been living in Glasgow for the past six months while he completed his asylum application, was found dead in his room at McLay\u2019s Guest House in the city centre on 5 May.

  "<p>Yeah yeah yeah, I know, it\u2019s like we\u2019re living in a Black Mirror episode. We\u2019ve got headless robot dogs <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/coronavirus-lockdown-singapore-robot-dog-spot-boston-dynamics-a9506781.html\">patrolling Singaporean parks</a> to enforce social distancing, we\u2019re all trapped on social media which is now just a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=alison%20roman&amp;src=typed_query\">rolling</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=liz%20bruenig&amp;src=typed_query\">cancellation</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=amanda%20palmer&amp;src=typed_query\">colosseum</a> where soon each user will have their time of standing before the masses and hearing exactly what everyone thinks of them, and who needs killer bee drones when we have murder hornets.</p> <p>If we have Black Mirror on our news do we really need Black Mirror on our Netflix? The creator himself says no. Charlie Brooker gave <a href=\"https://www.radiotimes.com/news/on-demand/2020-05-04/black-mirror-6-update/\">an interview</a> to Radio Times saying he doesn\u2019t think audiences would have the stomach for a dystopia right now, as we seem to be living through the beginning stages of societal collapse with our pandemic lockdowns and mass unemployment.</p> <p>But I for one urge our creators to bring on the darkness.</p> <p>During some of the bleakest years of the recent past, with an endless war conducted in multiple countries mostly with drones, a migrant crisis caused by people fleeing war and economic devastation, an economy that benefited the few and left everyone else scrambling to monetize every aspect of their lives they could think of just to survive \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m not using this second bedroom/car/blood plasma right now, what if I found a way to charge someone for it\u201d \u2013 we somehow got addicted to cutesy pop self-empowerment anthems.</p> <p>We had bright little pop stars, trained from birth to be cheery, professional, and approachable, all vaguely looking the same like they all came out of the same laboratory (or at least the same plastic surgeon\u2019s office), bouncing up and down and singing songs about how great we are all doing. \u201cCause I\u2019m a champion and you\u2019re gonna hear me roar\u201d and \u201cCause baby you\u2019re a firework, come on show them what you\u2019re worth\u201d and whatever else. Like ceaseless robotic cheerleaders designed by Lisa Frank, hysterically celebrating us as we grind and hustle our way to poverty and early death. And yes, there was a Black Mirror episode about that, too.</p> <p>I\u2019m not saying pop music was to blame for our inability to notice the game was fixed or to organize and fight against the gig economy and the supreme wealth of our oligarchs and technocrats, but certainly it was an effective means of escapism. Outside was a burning hellscape of environmental collapse and militarized police, but all we had to do to break free from that was put on our headphones or look at our devices and suddenly it was all rainbows and candy colored fantasy.</p> <p>And why not try to escape all of this? But personally, the cognitive dissonance was too harsh. The transition from the horrifying headlines of war and illness and suffering to Taylor Swift in a bathtub filled with jewels was giving me migraines. \u201cActually, I\u2019m not feeling great about being me,\u201d I whispered back to Swift as I lay in bed in the same clothes I wore on each of the previous three days. \u201cAt this rate I\u2019ll never be able to buy a couch that isn\u2019t secondhand let alone diamonds,\u201d I psychically projected toward Ariana Grande.</p> <p>Black Mirror debuted back in 2011 when we were all still very optimistic about the ability for technology to reshape and reconnect the world. Twitter and Facebook being praised for its ability to bring down despotic governments, not undermine democratic elections or facilitate genocide. Instagram was about sharing, not causing depression or fostering <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om3r1qKnwS0\">suicide cults</a>.</p> <p>These two worlds seemed to converge in 2016 with the release of season three when Netflix went down because a bunch of teenagers \u2013 maybe, we have no idea \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/26/ddos-attack-dyn-mirai-botnet\">brought down the internet</a> by hacking wifi-enabled appliances. I was sitting on my couch wondering why I couldn\u2019t load the season premiere, having no idea it was because people didn\u2019t change the passwords on their dishwashers. Because of the work of good journalists and whistleblowers and yes some television programs, we\u2019re all a little more aware of the dark side of our tech-infused world and a little less optimistic that it will solve rather than create problems.</p> <p>We look to our entertainment to do too much for us these days. We look to our television series to provide moral instruction, we argue about whether or not characters are good \u201crole models,\u201d we fight over accurate representation. For godsake, we announce our Harry Potter houses like it means something, looking to the great sorting hat of the sky to give us a coherent sense of self.</p> <p>So I\u2019m not looking for a television show to solve this crisis or give us an illumined path toward a rebuilt society. Billionaires are profiting off the hundreds of thousands of Covid-19 deaths and the mass unemployment and <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/05/08/andrew-cuomo-eric-schmidt-coronavirus-tech-shock-doctrine/\">tech titans</a> are using the power vacuum to remake the world according to their vision and <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/n7jaw7/amazon-fresh-whole-foods-delivery-time-slot-bots\">the only people who can get grocery delivery</a> are the ones who know how to install a bot and I don\u2019t know how to install a bot so I can\u2019t get Cheez Its. So don\u2019t tell me how great I\u2019m doing or sell me some fantasy of self-improvement. Bring back the dystopia. Because right now I can\u2019t stand being lied to.</p> <ul> <li><p>Jessa Crispin is a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul>",

  "<p>What happens when a man who is accustomed to being the centre of attention finds himself becoming invisible? When a life busked from cash in hand jobs trips into freefall? Julia Solomonoff\u2019s delicately textured character study follows Nico (Guillermo Pfening), the former star of an Argentinian soap opera, who trades autograph hunters for anonymity and moves from Buenos Aires to New York to take a role in an indie movie. Instead he finds himself unmoored in a city which sees him as just another Hispanic immigrant. If it sees him at all.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/08/the-most-dangerous-game-my-streaming-gem\">My streaming gem: why you should watch The Most Dangerous Game</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A film which exposes the vulnerability of a life lived without a safety net, with no legal status and no financial support, might seem a little close for comfort for some viewers at this particular moment in time. But what the film explores, achingly and eloquently, are the existential implications of dislocation and isolation. The way that worth can be weighed in interactions with other people and how a dissonance can build in a person when their self-image doesn\u2019t match the way the world views them. Deftly edited and anchored by a subtly revealing performance from Pfening, this US and Argentina-set drama is a bittersweet little gem which, crucially, hints at hope once the clouds part and the dark days are passed.</p> <p>That Nico\u2019s exile from his glittering life in Argentina is self-imposed is a key point in this migrant story. He\u2019s well-connected, well-travelled. His pursuit of an American dream is driven by defiance rather than desperation. The loose offer of a role in an as yet unfunded film is the impetus he needed to end his on-off love affair with Mart\u00edn, the married producer of the television series he stars in. Success \u2013 and the possibility that this next instalment of his life won\u2019t be a success doesn\u2019t initially occur to him \u2013 will be his revenge.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82_5Ff3ggi8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/82_5Ff3ggi8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>But when we meet Nico, he has already been in the city long enough for his visa to expire, his money to run out and for doubts about the future to start to take root. The film\u2019s start date, pushed back several times, has taken on a mirage quality, insubstantial but tantalisingly still on the horizon. The jobs and side hustles that keep Nico solvent are just about bearable while he can still see himself with a work visa and a film career somewhere in the future. But when the film collapses once and for all, he can no longer comfortably tell himself he\u2019s an actor filling the time between jobs with bar work, cleaning, childcare and a sideline in shoplifting. Having previously wafted away the offer of payment for looking after the baby of a well-heeled friend from Argentina, there comes a moment when his pride crumbles and he accepts the roll of notes offered by her husband. It stings, this readjustment in status from peer to hired help. The camera lingers on Pfening\u2019s face long enough to catch an involuntary wince that he hides from the couple.</p> <p>Restless handheld cinematography and brisk, sometimes almost breathless editing, give a sense of the exhausting rhythm of Nico\u2019s hand-to-mouth existence and the superhuman juggling act required to muster the charisma that used to come naturally. Time and again, the lens is drawn to Pfening, and a remarkable layered performance which offers glimpses beneath his actor\u2019s professional poise. Nico is someone who has taken for granted the privilege that his looks \u2013 sunny complexion and blond hair \u2013 bestow. But now at auditions for bit parts, casting directors make it clear that his face doesn\u2019t fit. \u201cNobody cares that you are a star in your own country. Get rid of your accent, darken your hair,\u201d a producer tells him, adding that \u201cit\u2019s an exciting time for Latinos\u201d. As the easy charm gradually flakes away and reveals his mounting desperation, so the superficial circle in which he moves recoils from him. Failure is a turn-off.</p> <p>Solomonoff, a writer, director and actor who is based in Buenos Aires and who teaches at Columbia University in New York, brings a perceptive outsider\u2019s eye to the city. New York is both alluring and cruel; like Ira Sachs\u2019s Love Is Strange, the film depicts subsisting in the city as akin to negotiating an unpredictable quasi-abusive relationship, a relationship not dissimilar to the one Nico fled in the first place. It\u2019s an experience that leaves him looking increasingly beaten up as Manhattan\u2019s showy autumn colours damp down and winter creeps in. But, as the film suggests in a bright coda, broken hearts eventually mend. And the sun shines again.</p> <ul> <li><p>Nobody\u2019s Watching is available on Amazon Prime in the US and UK</p></li> </ul>",

Covid-19 reveals the costs to workers crowded together under already dangerous working conditions in jobs that often lacked sick leave and healthcare benefits. These are all problems dating from the early 1980s when the shareholder value movement forced corporations to have profit as their sole goal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s woken up a lot of people about how consolidated this system is, and how it is not very resilient, it\u2019s really vulnerable,\u201d said Lilliston. \u201cPeople asking about food security in the US is kind of new. There is also a greater awareness of worker rights - the lack of power, working tightly packed together, the lack of government enforcement and inspection. I think there is going to be some fallout but whether action will be taken remains to be seen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is clear that centralisation of processes into fewer and fewer centres, coupled with just-in-time supply chains, leads to a lack of resilience,\u201d said Prof Tim Benton, research director for emerging risks at Chatham House, a London thinktank. \u201cIt\u2019s not so easy to draft in a slaughterman off the street than to pull in casual labour into supermarkets or even farming.\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian contacted all the companies named above. Cargill, JBS, Tyson and BRF detailed the significant work they are doing to deal with these issues including, in the case of JBS, working with physicians specialising in infectious diseases to develop a protocol, and, in the case of BRF, working with a global consultancy that specialises in risk management. Tyson has put aside $120m to give its workers \u201cthank you bonuses\u201d. All four said that they are carrying out special measures in their plants to protect workers, including distancing, staggered breaks, keeping vulnerable workers home and distributing face masks.</p> <p>Cargill pointed out: \u201cWe are also sensitive that farmers and ranchers need a place to move their cattle. This is a difficult balancing act facing our entire industry \u2026 We recognise farmers and ranchers rely on the global food system to earn their livelihoods, so it is critical we keep the market moving \u2013 for the farm economy and for the people and animals who rely on us for their food and nourishment.\u201d</p> <p>Litera Meats told the Guardian it is focused on keeping workers safe, and that \u201cgood sense, caution, collaboration and understanding\u201d are the principles guiding the response.

Directed by Derek Cianfrance (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/apr/14/place-beyond-the-pines-review\">The Place Beyond the Pines</a>), it follows the story of Dominick, who is coping with a failed marriage and an ailing mother while looking after Thomas, who has paranoid schizophrenia. It is a traumatic and twisty tale packed with formidable performances from Ruffalo, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/26/melissa-leo-interview-novitiate\">Melissa Leo</a> as his mother and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/17/archie-panjabi-interview-the-good-wife-departure-eastenders\">Archie Panjabi</a> as his therapist. <strong>Ammar Kalia</strong></p> <h2><strong>Ricky &amp; Ralf\u2019s Very Northern Road Trip</strong></h2> <h2><strong>8pm, Gold</strong></h2> <p>Fictional father and son Ricky Tomlinson and Ralf Little journey around northern England for six weeks in this charming new series. In this first outing, they hit Blackpool (\u201cThe Vegas of the north, although instead of Frank Sinatra, it\u2019s Jimmy Cricket and the Krankies\u201d). <strong>Ali Catterall</strong></p> <h2><strong>George W Bush</strong></h2> <h2><strong>8.45pm, PBS America</strong></h2> <p>A two-part deep-dive into the US\u2019s 43rd president, George W Bush, covering his wayward youth and unconventional route to the White House following the heavily contested 2000 election. Now viewed by some in a more palatable light in the wake of Trump\u2019s election, his legacy is examined. <strong>AK</strong></p> <h2><strong>Normal People</strong></h2> <h2><strong>9pm, BBC One</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fcb920571eef735ea616cff7c097d421c79b19b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fcb920571eef735ea616cff7c097d421c79b19b9/75_331_4209_2525/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Mescal in Normal People\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Electric performer ...

  "<p>The mountain slopes of Arag\u00f3n, a Spanish region bordering France, are one corner of Europe where there is no ambivalence about migrant farm workers. The humans want them and the sheep want them.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to make sure these people can get here soon because the weather is getting warmer and we need to get the wool off the animals or it\u2019ll be awful,\u201d said Pedro Barato, the president of Spain\u2019s largest farming association, Asaja.</p> <p>The lack of skilled sheep-shearers was acute, he said. \u201cNormally, people come from South America \u2013 mainly Uruguay and Paraguay \u2013 to help.\u201d The wider region needs about 30,000 workers but only 5,500 have been hired, he said.</p> <p>Barato said his organisation\u2019s members had always appreciated migrant labour. \u201cWe\u2019ve never, ever seen it as a problem. It\u2019s quite the opposite. We\u2019re very grateful for it.\u201d</p> <p>In other parts of Europe, however, migrant farm workers are considered a problem and are greeted not with gratitude but resentment and suspicion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38366465bd16b071c1099ce08dc95cbb8cb8cf2b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38366465bd16b071c1099ce08dc95cbb8cb8cf2b/0_301_4512_2707/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sheep at a farm near Madrid\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arag\u00f3n\u2019s sheep farmers are badly in need of skilled shearers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rodrigo Jimenez/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From Ireland to Italy and Germany to Romania there is rising tension over whether such workers should cross borders to harvest crops, and if so how many and under what conditions.</p> <p>They are needed to pick strawberries, oranges, melons, tomatoes and asparagus but the coronavirus pandemic has concocted a toxic brew.</p> <p>Host countries are torn between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/farmers-across-europe-bank-on-improvised-armies-of-pickers-to-save-harvest\">fear of losing harvests</a>, fear of importing infection and a fear that predates the pandemic \u2013 that of foreigners taking jobs. Populists sense opportunity as the economic fallout solidifies political battle lines.</p> <p>The fear is two-way. Migrants fear <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/01/no-food-water-masks-or-gloves-migrant-farm-workers-in-spain-at-crisis-point\">exploitation and inadequate safeguards against Covid-19</a> that could cause them to become infected and bring the disease home, potentially undermining <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/why-has-eastern-europe-suffered-less-from-coronavirus-than-the-west\">eastern Europe\u2019s relative success</a> in suppressing the virus.</p> <p>\u201cRomanian seasonal workers are not slaves. Human dignity and health are not negotiable,\u201d said Victor Negrescu, a Romanian MEP who together with colleagues submitted a letter to the European ombudsman requesting protection of seasonal workers.</p> <p>The request followed a spate of incidents across the continent. There was a furore when 1,800 workers from the Romanian city of Cluj were shown in close physical contact while being bussed to and boarding a plane \u2013 one of the near-daily flights from Cluj to Germany.</p> <p>Germany has in recent weeks received 30,000 seasonal workers from eastern Europe and expects another 30,000 by the end of May, most coming for asparagus and strawberry harvests.</p> <p>In theory strict guidelines govern migrant workers\u2019 journeys and living and working conditions. But reality is proving messy.</p> <p>An asparagus farmer in Lower Saxony was accused of breaking physical distancing rules when he transported workers and put more people than allowed into prefabricated housing.</p> <p>A picker who died in Bad Krozingen on 11 April was infected with coronavirus, though the cause of death remains unclear. Four other pickers in his team were also infected and placed in isolation. On 28 April Romanian authorities announced that at least 200 Romanians working in an abattoir in Germany had been infected.</p> <p>The stakes are particularly high in Italy, where crops risk rotting in the fields and a political battle is escalating.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"296a92aacf57815074085dad7ba7fdc22047bd94\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/296a92aacf57815074085dad7ba7fdc22047bd94/0_0_3543_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A migrant farm worker in Italy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A migrant farm worker in Calabria, southern Italy.

It fears losing ground to Matteo Salvini\u2019s anti-migrant opposition party the League.</p> <p>Salvini has threatened to take to the streets to resist what he calls a \u201cpro-migrant amnesty\u201d that would be \u201cdevastating and crime-producing\u201d. Pope Francis, in contrast, has backed the measure and urged better pay and conditions for migrant workers.</p> <p>Ireland has long prided itself on welcoming foreign workers but a row last month exposed tensions.</p> <p>Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach, criticised Keelings, a Dublin fruit company, for flying in 189 Bulgarians to pick strawberries. He expressed \u201cdiscomfort\u201d and called for a review of rules to protect Ireland\u2019s lockdown. He did not mention that just weeks earlier he had joined EU leaders in requesting continued cross-border travel rights for agricultural workers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt felt a bit populist of Leo not to ackowelege that,\u201d said Pippa Woolnough, of the Immigrant Council of Ireland. She voiced concern that the public backlash against Keelings reflected scapegoating of immigrants that is new to Ireland \u2013 and may worsen as the economic crisis bites.</p> <p>John Greene, a strawberry farmer in County Wexford, said there was an online \u201cangry mob\u201d ready to pounce. \u201cYou have to be so careful. You can be brought down by false rumour. Last weekend social media was saying we have a busload of pickers travelling through Enniscorthy every morning packed like sardines. It\u2019s absolutely untrue: we don\u2019t have pickers or a bus.\u201d</p> <p>Greene has held off bringing in his usual crew of east European pickers in hope that locals will do the job. However few suitable candidates have applied. \u201cIt\u2019s all up in the air.\u201d</p> <p>Dermot Callaghan, of the agri-food agency Teagasc, said foreign workers were necessary. \u201cThey have experience that you can\u2019t replace in one season. It\u2019ll be a blend of experienced workers augmented with selected local staff.\u201d</p>",

Bars, restaurants, theatres and cinemas remain closed. Primary schools will take small numbers of pupils, depending on space. Masks will be obligatory on public transport. Everyone will be able to move outside without having to present a form on demand but people will only be able to go 100 kilometres from their place of residence.</li> \n   <li><strong>Belgium:</strong> Most businesses will open Monday, with social distancing. Masks are recommended. Cafes, restaurants and bars remain closed. In central Brussels there will be speed limits on cars and priority will be given to cyclists and pedestrians. Schools remain closed until 18 May.</li> \n   <li><strong>Britain</strong>: People will be actively encouraged to return to work from this week if they cannot work from home. Unlimited outdoor exercise will be allowed from Wednesday. From 1 June (at the earliest) nurseries and primary schools may reopen, and some non-essential shops. By July, at least some of the hospitality industry and other public places could be reopened.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Netherlands: </strong>Primary schools will partially reopen Monday. Driving schools, hair salons, physiotherapists and libraries also return, with social distancing measures.</li> \n   <li><strong>Switzerland: </strong>Primary and middle schools will reopen Monday, with classes often reduced in size. Restaurants, museums and bookshops will also open, with conditions. Meetings of more than five people remain banned.</li> \n   <li><strong>Spain</strong>: Half of Spain\u2019s 47 million people will be able to meet with family or friends in gatherings of up to 10 as of Monday. Outdoor spaces at bars and restaurants can reopen with limited capacity. Hardest-hit Madrid and Barcelona are excluded from the easing, though football clubs FC Barcelona resumed training on Friday and Real Madrid will follow Monday. Only movements within provinces are authorised and cinemas and theatres remain closed. Schools will not start up again until September.</li> \n   <li><strong>Italy</strong>: While schools remain closed until September, factories, building sites and offices reopened on 4 May. Social distancing rules are in place in parks. Wearing masks is mandatory on public transport. All retail businesses will reopen on 18 May, as will museums, cultural sites, churches and libraries. Bars and restaurants will reopen from 1 June, along with hair and beauty salons.</li> \n   <li><strong>Germany</strong>: Eating in restaurants is now possible in the north-eastern state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, where the country\u2019s first cafes and restaurants reopened on Saturday. Under Germany\u2019s federal system, each of the 16 states makes its own decisions on how to emerge from lockdown and cafes and restaurants will reopen in a number of other states in the coming days and weeks. Most shops are already open and children are slowly returning to classrooms. Bundesliga football matches are also set to resume. Heeding signs of a second wave, German authorities have agreed to reimpose restrictions locally if an area has more than 50 new infections per 100,000 residents over a week.</li> \n   <li><strong>Austria</strong>: Hairdressers, tennis courts and golf courses reopened in the first weekend in May. Travel restrictions have been lifted and gatherings of up to 10 people are allowed, with social distancing. Masks are compulsory in public transport and shops.
