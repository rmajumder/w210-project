Stories of confusion have accompanied the sharp rise in deaths, from cases of mistaken identity to days-long searches for the bodies of loved ones who have passed away. </p> \n  <p>For Mercedes Maroto, the saga began when her mother, Teodora, was admitted to a hospital in central Spain last month. Days later, after a full day had passed without any news, Maroto and her siblings began calling the hospital.</p> \n  <p>It took four attempts before they got a doctor on the line. He informed them that their mother had passed away, Maroto told Spanish newspaper El Mundo.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a8dff8c6b79a0ae2d2781e97305b61a7e1d932f\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a8dff8c6b79a0ae2d2781e97305b61a7e1d932f/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman rests in front a shop in Pamplona, northern Spain\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman rests in front a shop in Pamplona, northern Spain.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00c1lvaro Barrientos/AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>The news left the family reeling, particularly Maroto\u2019s father. \u201cHe kept repeating, between sobs: \u2018Now what do I do without you?\u2019\u201d</p> \n  <p>After a sleepless night punctuated with questions \u2013 How did she die?

She rushed over to the hospital where a doctor helped her speak to her mother on the phone.</p> \n  <p>While she described it as the \u201cworst experience of her life\u201d, Maroto shied away from casting blame, pointing to the chaos that has taken hold at Spanish hospitals as they scramble to treat the sudden influx of thousands of thousands of Covid-19 patients.</p> \n  <p>Her mother is now home and slowly regaining her strength.

What has been widely reported as the end of Wuhan\u2019s lockdown is somewhat different from his lived experience, he writes: </p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>What you\u2019ve seen happen today is the \u2018exit door\u2019 open to allow thousands of people who have been trapped in Wuhan for 76 days to finally go home.<br></p> \n   <p>Life for residents of Wuhan is still more restricted than UK\u2019s so-called lockdown. Each district is controlled by its own local authority so it\u2019s not entirely uniform but the basics are the same.</p> \n   <p>To leave the community residence you need a green health code via an app on your phone. This is tied to your Chinese ID card and logs who you are and where you are. Your temperature is also taken.</p> \n   <p>To use the limited public transport you also need to log in and out using the app. Foreigners don\u2019t have an ID card so they can\u2019t use it.</p> \n   <p>Anyone returning to work also needs a special certificate verifying that the business has been given permission to restart. Otherwise you\u2019re expected to return to your home within two hours.</p> \n   <p>Restaurants, cafes, stores, anywhere that people might gather are still closed.

Drafted into the US army, but fortunate enough to escape a tour of duty in Vietnam, he spent the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/may/21/golden-daze-50-years-on-from-summer-of-love-san-francisco-festivals\">Summer of Love</a> stationed in Germany. Prine arrived back in the US at the end of 1967, just as rock music began to leave psychedelic experiments behind and head earthbound again, which suited him just fine.</p> \n  <p>He was born in 1946 and learned to write songs during the early 60s folk revival by imitating the Carter Family. Eighteen months after he returned to civilian life in Chicago, he saw Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash performing together on the latter\u2019s TV show. \u201cI thought the music I was playing and writing, it\u2019d fit straight in-between the two of \u2019em,\u201d he recalled in 2019. \u201cI thought, \u2018That\u2019s exactly where I want to be.\u2019\u201d</p> \n  <p>Almost uniquely among the glut of early 70s singer-songwriters, Prine \u2013 who has died aged 73 \u2013 seemed untouched by the countercultural events of the preceding years: he seemed to tap into an earlier musical tradition, \u201can authentic, rather catchy extension of Nashville and Appalachia\u201d, as critic Robert Christgau noted of Prine\u2019s eponymous 1971 debut album. </p> \n  <p>He was not given to writing starry-eyed paeans to the denizens of the Woodstock festival. His albums never sounded as if they had emerged from the stoned, eucalyptus-scented idyll of Laurel Canyon. There was something tough and austere about them, perhaps because of Prine\u2019s voice \u2013 a rough, artless, nasal rasp that Dylan suggested sounded as if Prine had swallowed a jew\u2019s harp. It got more gravelly as the years progressed and he recovered first from neck, then from lung cancer.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/08/john-prine-songwriter-bob-dylan-johnny-cash-bruce-springsteen\">John Prine: this extraordinarily gifted songwriter was the envy of all</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8d31338f08ec70cecec8b1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-08T02:12:40.183Z\">3.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Rosanne Cash, Johnny Cash\u2019s daughter has tweeted about John Prine\u2019s death: </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/rosannecash/status/1247706520596463616\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Just give me one thing I can hold on to.

  "<p>The White House on Wednesday confirmed the appointment of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/07/stephanie-grisham-out-as-trumps-press-secretary-after-never-briefing-the-press\">Kayleigh McEnany</a> as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>\u2019s fourth press secretary \u2013 even as her long history of disturbing public statements came to light.</p> <p>McEnany, who turns 32 next week, worked for the former Arkansas governor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mikehuckabee\">Mike Huckabee</a> on his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/fox-news\">Fox News</a> show and as a pro-Trump commentator on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/cnn\">CNN</a> during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\">2016 presidential election</a>. She became national spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, then for Trump\u2019s re-election campaign.</p> <p>A survey of past remarks and tweets suggests she is perfectly qualified for the job of being his master\u2019s voice \u2013 and attacking his nemesis, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama\">Barack Obama</a>. For instance, she embraced the original sin of Trumpian politics: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/16/donald-trump-barack-obama-birther-theory-video\">birtherism</a>. It is the conspiracy theory that Obama, America\u2019s first black president, was not born in the US but rather in Kenya.</p> <p>On 29 August 2012, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kayleighmcenany/status/240993516443037698?s=20\">McEnany tweeted:</a> \u201cHow I Met Your Brother -- Never mind, forgot he\u2019s still in that hut in Kenya. #ObamaTVShows\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/07/stephanie-grisham-out-as-trumps-press-secretary-after-never-briefing-the-press\">Kayleigh McEnany replaces Stephanie Grisham as Trump press secretary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Along with the spurious dig at Obama, who was born in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hawaii\">Hawaii</a>, the tweet also traded on stereotypes of Africans living in huts. Highlighting the tweet on Tuesday, Richard Painter, a former White House chief ethics lawyer, wrote: \u201cWhat is this? A KKK rally in the White House?\u201d</p> <p>As president, Trump reportedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/12/donald-trump-shithole-countries-tweet-denies-immigration-talks\">called</a> African nations \u201cshithole countries\u201d and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/15/donald-trump-press-conference-far-right-defends-charlottesville\">said</a> of a deadly white supremacist protest in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/16/why-is-the-us-still-fighting-the-civil-war\">Charlottesville</a>, Virginia: \u201cYou also had people that were very fine people on both sides.\u201d But McEnany told the Fox Business Network in May 2018: \u201cThe president has come out multiple times saying he denounces all racism. We all denounce racism, that would include the president.\u201d</p> <p>In March 2017, she tried to defend Trump\u2019s frequent golfing by turning the tables on Obama over the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/daniel-pearl\">Daniel Pearl</a>, a Wall Street Journal reporter in Pakistan.</p> <p>\u201cYou had President Obama, who after the \u2013 I believe it was the beheading of Daniel Pearl \u2013 spoke to how upset he was about that, then rushed off to a golf game,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/03/28/pro-trump-pundit-accuses-obama-of-golfing-after-daniel-pearls-slaying-in-2002/\">she claimed on CNN.</a> \u201cI think when we\u2019re in a state of war, when we\u2019re in a state of mourning, you should take time off from the golf course.\u201d</p> <p>But when Pearl died in 2002, Obama was still a state senator. McEnany subsequently apologised, explaining she meant to say <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/james-foley\">James Foley</a>, a photojournalist kidnapped in Syria and beheaded by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis\">Islamic State</a> in 2014.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/01/20/president-trump-made-16241-false-or-misleading-claims-his-first-three-years/\">According to a Washington Post count,</a> Trump made 16,241 false or misleading claims in his first three years in office. But on 28 August 2019, McEnany told CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo: \u201cNo. I don\u2019t believe the president has lied.\u201d</p> <p>And taking her cue from the president, McEnany played down the threat of the coronavirus. On Trish Regan\u2019s Fox Business Network show in late February, she praised Trump\u2019s partial Chinese travel ban <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AaronBlake/status/1247543589833527297?s=20\">and asserted:</a> \u201cWe will not see diseases like the coronavirus come here. And isn\u2019t it refreshing when contrasting it with the awful presidency of President Obama?\u201d</p> <p>Regan later parted ways with the network after calling the coronavirus an \u201cimpeachment scam\u201d. McEnany has been rewarded with a senior job at the White House.</p> <p>On 28 February, McEnany appeared on Fox News. \u201cWhat is bad for America is good for Democrats. It\u2019s incredible that they think this way. They root against the stock market. They root for this [coronavirus] to take hold. They have a demented dream of taking down President Trump. It doesn\u2019t matter how many Americans they destroy in order to get there.\u201d</p> <p>On 11 March, with the Democratic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2020\">presidential</a> candidate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a> and then candidate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders\">Bernie Sanders</a> having cancelled campaign rallies, she was asked on the Fox Business Network whether Trump would follow suit. She wasn\u2019t worried, she insisted. \u201cLook, we have the commander-in-chief, we have the best health experts, we are taking it day by day, we are currently proceeding as normal,\u201d McEnany said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd look, Joe Biden, he\u2019s suspending his rallies. He\u2019s been dying to get off the campaign trail. The man can only speak for seven minutes \u2026 The media\u2019s best hope is for Donald Trump to suspend his rallies \u2026 they know it\u2019s his avenue to speak directly to the American people.\u201d</p> <p>Later that day, the Trump campaign did cancel rallies.</p> <p>Meanwhile, when it comes to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change\">climate crisis</a>, McEnany has a history of denying the scientific consensus that humans are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/10/climate-emergency-global-action-way-off-track-says-un-head-coronavirus\">heating the planet</a>, primarily by burning fossil fuels.</p> <p>In 2014, when climate protesters marched during a cold winter in Washington DC, McEnany told Fox News: \u201cThe science is not settled, so let\u2019s stop the liberal hysteria, take a break from the protesting, go get some hot cocoa, sit inside.\u201d</p> <p>The Fox host Neil Cavuto and McEnany laughed as an Occidental College professor explained that the vast majority of qualified climatologists agreed on the climate threat.</p> <p>McEnany countered that \u201cin the 1970s it was global cooling\u201d and \u201cthey always change the verbiage. It\u2019s the verbiage to justify the liberal mechanisms that they would like to put in place.\u201d</p> <p>McEnany also claimed corruption of the scientific process, saying: \u201cLet\u2019s be real. Who\u2019s getting the grants? Who are the liberal universities giving the grants to? Of course it\u2019s going to be people who buy into the fact that global warming does exist.\u201d</p> <p>More recently, McEnany has shifted to focusing on the costs of addressing the climate crisis.</p> <p>In February, McEnany <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kayleighmcenany/status/1225979282574454784?s=20\">tweeted</a> that the Democratic plan for climate change was \u201cto eliminate more than 1 million jobs in America by eliminating the fossil fuel industry. Kill the economy!\u201d</p> <p>Last July, she mocked the former <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2020\">2020</a> candidates <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kayleighmcenany/status/1156359752714194944?s=20\">Pete Buttigieg</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kayleighmcenany/status/1156580949104218115?s=20\">Beto O\u2019Rourke</a> for emphasizing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report\">narrowing window</a> for addressing the crisis.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s first two press secretaries were caught in lies. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/sean-spicer\">Sean Spicer</a> began by claiming about Trump\u2019s inauguration: \u201cThis was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration \u2013 period \u2013 both in person and around the globe.\u201d Sarah Sanders <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/18/mueller-report-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-lying-comey\">admitted</a> that her claims that she personally communicated with \u201ccountless\u201d FBI officials about Trump\u2019s decision to fire <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/james-comey\">James Comey</a> was a \u201cslip of the tongue\u201d.</p> <p>Then came Stephanie Grisham, who became the press secretary and White House communications director last June but never gave a formal press briefing. Grisham will rejoin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/melania-trump\">Melania Trump</a>\u2019s office in a new role as chief of staff.</p> <p>McEnany is a rising star in Trumpworld despite \u2013 or because of \u2013 her misstatements. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/30/brad-parscale-trump-social-media-rasputin-campaign-manager\">Brad Parscale</a>, Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign manager, said: \u201cKayleigh McEnany is a first-class professional who will serve President Trump and the American people well. She has been one of the strongest assets to the president\u2019s re-election campaign with her keen mind, positive attitude, strong faith, and tireless work ethic.\u201d</p>",

The team believes the two-week lag is caused by the delay between symptoms starting and becoming very severe. </p> \n  <p>Lead researcher, Prof Tim Spector from King\u2019s College London, said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is really encouraging to see that the rate of new symptoms being reported is beginning to fall. </p> \n   <p>Even though hospital admissions and deaths are still on the rise, we hope that these figures offer a much needed light at the end of the tunnel. </p> \n   <p>We have been totally blown away by the public\u2019s response to the app. </p> \n   <p>On the first day we saw one million members of the public download it making it one of the most successful first days for an app ever, and already probably the UK\u2019s largest citizen science project. </p> \n   <p>The altruism of the UK public combined with modern technology is allowing us to rapidly collect huge amounts of invaluable data to help us better understand this deadly virus. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>However, while symptoms have been decreasing nationally, researchers say that their data shows that in all areas there are still many people with active symptoms. </p> \n  <p>The data also shows that individual areas vary. Most of the country\u2019s larger cities like <strong>London</strong>, <strong>Birmingham</strong>, <strong>Glasgow</strong>, and <strong>Liverpool</strong> continue to have very high levels of symptoms in the community, even this far into lockdown. <strong>South</strong> <strong>Wales</strong> is another hotspot. </p> \n  <p>There are significantly higher levels of symptoms across the <strong>Midlands</strong>, the <strong>North</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>England</strong> and <strong>southern</strong> <strong>Scotland</strong> than in the south-west of England. </p> \n  <p>The Covid Symptom Tracker app was developed by a King\u2019s College London team in association with the Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust, NIHR Biomedical Research Centre and healthcare start-up ZOE Global Limited. </p> \n  <p>You can download the app, and view an interactive map showing the suggested distribution of Covid-19 in your area, <a href=\"https://covid.joinzoe.com/\">here</a>.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8da6618f08008f0919f1c7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-08T10:26:56.375Z\">11.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Following a news report this morning regarding cats and coronavirus, the British Veterinary Association has clarified its advice for cat owners during the pandemic.</p> \n  <p>The BVA\u2019s president, Daniella Dos Santos, said only cats from infected or self-isolating households should be kept indoors as a precaution.

The greatest match in FA Cup history ended a few minutes ago, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/apr/08/crystal-palace-v-liverpool-1990-fa-cup-semi-final-live\">Crystal Palace beating Liverpool 4-3 in an absolute astonisher at Villa Park</a>. Spare a thought for the players of Oldham and Manchester United, who have the impossible task of trying to replicate the drama when they kick off at Maine Road.</p> <p>As if they\u2019ll give a flying Fibonacci about that! A place in the FA Cup final is at stake, for goodness sake, and both teams would happily take the ugliest 1-0 win in history. Especially United. The FA Cup has become an obsession for them and their hapless manager Alex Ferguson, who was on the brink of the sack at the start of their cup run. If they lose today, he\u2019ll be back on the brink.</p> <p>United haven\u2019t been to Wembley since Ferguson took over in 1986. Oldham\u2019s last trip was minus 21 days ago: they will play Nottingham Forest in the Littlewoods Cup final at the end of the month. They\u2019ve been stealing the headlines ever since Frankie Bunn walloped six goals against Scarborough in the Littlewoods Cup in October, and if they win today they will become the first lower-division side to reach both English cup finals in the same season.</p> <p>When Oldham thrashed Aston Villa, the Division One leaders, in the quarter-final last month, the smart money was on them beating United. But things have changed since then. Oldham have lost their last three games without scoring a goal and are down to to ninth in Division Two, though they do have two games in hand on all the sides above them. It looks like their season of derring-do \u2013 this is their 54th game, with at least another 10 to come \u2013 might be catching up with them. </p> <p>United, meanwhile, are in a bit of a purple patch: they have won two league games in a row for only the second time in 14 months, and are now five points above the relegation zone.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Research by Oxford\u2019s Reuters Institute for the study of journalism found that while politicians, celebrities and other prominent public figures were responsible for producing or spreading 20% of false claims about coronavirus, their posts accounted for 69% of total social media engagement.</p> \n<p>The issue has gained extra prominence as Britons began <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/06/at-least-20-uk-phone-masts-vandalised-over-false-5g-coronavirus-claims\">vandalising</a> mobile phone masts in recent days amid wildly sharing baseless claims linking the virus to 5G.</p> \n<p>Social media companies were summoned to a meeting with the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, on Wednesday afternoon to explain what they are doing to reduce the harm caused by false health claims about coronavirus on their platforms, with WhatsApp and YouTube having made tentative steps in recent days to reduce the impact.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>There is growing concern that online disinformation could be having real world health impacts. Research by Dr Daniel Allington, senior lecturer in social and cultural artificial intelligence at King\u2019s College London, suggested there was a statistically notable link between people who believed false claims about the coronavirus and people who were willing to flout the government\u2019s social distancing guidelines.</p> \n<p>His findings, <a href=\"https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/the-relationship-between-conspiracy-beliefs-and-compliance-with-public-health-guidance-with-regard-to-covid19(734ca397-6a4d-4208-bc1a-f3da12f04628).html\">based on a experimental study</a> conducted in coordination with the Centre for Countering Digital Hate, found that people who said they believed coronavirus was connected to 5G mobile phone masts are less likely to be staying indoors, washing their hands regularly or respecting physical distancing.</p> \n<p>While social media platforms have moved faster than in the past to flag disinformation about coronavirus on public groups, prominent actors and entertainers with millions of followers on Twitter and Instagram have helped fan the flames of misinformation, often reaching vastly more people than mainstream news outlets.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis small amount of people have a wide reach for the content that they are spreading,\u201d said Scott Brennen, a research fellow at the Reuters Institute. \u201cThe most common claims had to do with the policies and actions of public authorities, although we saw plenty of misinformation about the medical side.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said research into coronavirus disinformation almost certainly underestimated the enormous role played by WhatsApp because there are few ways for researchers to build an accurate picture of how material is spreading on the Facebook-owned service.</p> \n<p>In one example on Wednesday the South East Coast Ambulance Service was forced to issue <a href=\"http://www.secamb.nhs.uk/about_us/news/public_message.aspx\">a statement about a fake voicemail message</a> going viral on the service.

But Birgit Sippel, a German Social Democrat MEP, who sits on the European parliament\u2019s home affairs committee, said the delay in Germany fulfilling its pledge was the result of \u201ca political game\u201d and reluctance among Christian Democrats in the governing grand coalition to act. Describing the number of 50 as \u201cridiculous\u201d, she said it did \u201cnot [send] a strong signal regarding solidarity \u2026 from one of the biggest countries in Europe\u201d.</p> <p>Even if the pandemic had caused problems with organising flights, the German government had, she pointed out, repatriated EU travellers from around the world. While welcoming the decision, Greek officials said the process would probably be further complicated by Berlin\u2019s demand for the unaccompanied children to be exclusively girls below the age of 14.</p> <p>\u201cComing up with the perfect match isn\u2019t easy,\u201d said one official.</p> <p>At the end of February, Unicef counted 5,463 unaccompanied migrant children in Greece, including 1,752 living in overcrowded reception centres on the islands. Since that date the number is likely to have increased, as people have continued to arrive either seeking asylum or better prospects.

  "<p>It is perhaps best-known for its hipsters, but long before Shoreditch became avant garde, it was a place of agriculture and farmers according to evidence from a radiocarbon dating technique that has revealed details about Neolithic London.</p> <p>The technique proved that the most significant early Neolithic pottery discovered in London is 5,500 years old. It reveals for the first time that the city\u2019s prehistoric inhabitants led a less mobile, farming-based lifestyle than their hunter-gathering forebears.</p> <p>The research, published in Nature, reveals that an area around Shoreditch High Street was once populated by farmers herding their livestock across a once-green landscape. They were possibly linked to migrant groups who first introduced farming to Britain from continental Europe around 4,000 BC.</p> <p>Jon Cotton, a consultant prehistorian working for MOLA (Museum of London Archaeology), said: \u201cThis remarkable collection helps to fill a critical gap in London\u2019s prehistory. Archaeological evidence for the period after farming arrived in Britain rarely survives in the capital, let alone still in-situ. This is the strongest evidence yet that people in the area later occupied by the city and its immediate hinterland were living a less mobile, farming-based lifestyle during the early Neolithic period.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cIt seems quite likely that these people were semi-nomadic, but settling from time to time in various spots and very much geared around the herding of animals.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22cd779637884bbf6b65766ead09a1e2ef1211d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22cd779637884bbf6b65766ead09a1e2ef1211d2/0_34_3761_2256/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Artist\u2019s impression of Bronze Age Thames-side farming on the Greenwich Peninsula.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Artist\u2019s impression of Bronze Age Thames-side farming on the Greenwich Peninsula.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: see caption</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The technique, developed by scientists at the University of Bristol, is so accurate that it can pinpoint dates to a human life span.

He said: \u201cYou might have to imagine some small clearing within a wooded environment.

From these findings, the team estimated at least 4,700 of the \u201cforest islands\u201d identified were sites where humans once lived \u2013 and chucked their waste.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dcc84334cf85ddb4da9ef06538e2104e07361981\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dcc84334cf85ddb4da9ef06538e2104e07361981/0_5_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prof Umberto Lombardo sampling sediment cores in the Llanos de Moxos savannah.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prof Umberto Lombardo sampling sediment cores in the Llanos de Moxos savanna.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jose Capriles/Pennsylvania State University/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey are places where people just threw their rubbish after eating or whatever they did,\u201d said Lombardo, noting the accumulation went on for thousands of years, resulting in a raised platform that, safe from the savannah\u2019s seasonal floods, eventually became colonised by trees.</p> <p>Further analysis, using radiocarbon dating of charcoal or shell fragments within samples from 31 of the sites, reveal human occupation dating as far back as 10,850 years ago \u2013 shortly after the end of the last ice age, when cultivation of plants began independently in various regions of the world.</p> <p>Lombardo and colleagues then examined tiny particles of silica that were found alongside the material for dating. These particles, called phytoliths, form in plant tissues with phytoliths from different types of plants, and sometimes even different species, showing particular shapes.</p> <p>\u201cPhytoliths are plant microfossils,\u201d said Lombardo. \u201cAnd we can use them to identify the plants that lived in that place in the past.\u201d</p> <p>The team report a heart-shaped phytolith that came from cassava at one site, in a sample dating to about 10,350 years ago, with scalloped, spherical phytoliths from the rind of squash plants found in samples dating as far back as 10,250 years ago.</p> <p>Among other discoveries, the researchers found phytoliths from maize that date as far back as 6,850 years ago. </p> <p>The team said the plants had probably been cultivated in home gardens. But whether the plants were domesticated there \u2013 a process involving selection of particular traits \u2013 or were already semi-domesticated is less clear.</p> <p>Lombardo also cautioned that not all plants form phytoliths \u2013 among them are peanuts, which evidence from wild plants in the region suggests come from the south-west of the Amazon basin.</p> <p> Dr Sarah Elliott, an environmental archaeologist from the University of Bournemouth, who was not involved in the research, said the study was significant, noting the team had found the oldest evidence for squash associated directly with human activity and the earliest maize cultivation in the Amazon basin.</p> <p>\u201cThe human impact in the Amazon in the past was thought to be minimal,\u201d she said. \u201cBut new research such as this study demonstrates that the nature of human occupation and alteration of the landscape is extensive, and this region now has evidence for the implementation of cultivation from as far back as 10,250 years [ago].\u201d </p>",

But when a certain temperature threshold is crossed, suddenly a large proportion of species face conditions they have not experienced before, and the ecosystem can abruptly collapse.</p> \n<p>The authors base their projections on dividing the globe into square cells of 100km by 100km, and within those cells studying the geographic ranges of more than 30,000 species of birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and other animals and plants. They mapped this data against our knowledge of the climate from 1850 to 2005.</p> \n<p>Then they broke down climate predictions from now until 2100 on an annual basis, examining when the species in each grid cell were likely to experience temperatures higher than they had before. That showed a different picture than had been previously possible, by giving a slow-motion projection, a bit like a time-lapse photograph, at a very fine scale, of how species would react each year as their habitats warmed.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7eabde47-6152-469d-bad4-55ec6fd4a4b8\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cDespite many hundreds of studies looking at the impacts on biodiversity of climate change, this abrupt pattern [of collapse] hasn\u2019t previously been detected, because most studies have focused on projections for one \u2013 or a few \u2013 snapshots of the future, say the year 2070 or 2100,\u201d Pigot explained.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn our study, we instead quantified how the risks to biodiversity from climate change will change over time at annual resolutions.\u201d</p> \n<p>The scientists found that, on average, 73% of the species facing unprecedented temperatures before 2100 will cross that threshold simultaneously. If global temperatures rise by 4C above pre-industrial levels by 2100, as they will if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, then at least 15% of ecosystems will have an \u201cabrupt exposure event\u201d, meaning more than one fifth of their constituent species will cross the threshold in the same decade, causing irreversible damage.</p> \n<p>But at less than 2C of warming, the limit set under the Paris agreement, only 2% of ecosystems will go through such abrupt change, sparing many of the species at risk from higher temperatures.</p> \n<p>That means taking urgent action on emissions could save tens of thousands of species by \u201cflattening the curve\u201d of the impact, and providing more time for species and ecosystems to adapt.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is not too late to stop extinctions from climate change,\u201d said Christopher Trisos, of the University of Cape Town, co-author of the three-year study.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/07/oceans-losing-oxygen-at-unprecedented-rate-experts-warn\">Oceans losing oxygen at unprecedented rate, experts warn</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cOur research shows that rapid action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions this decade will effectively flatten the curve of species at risk.

  "<p>In an alternative universe, a new virus emerges in China. The country quickly identifies the pathogen, closes its borders, launches an unprecedented campaign to eradicate the virus, and manages to ensure that very few cases leave the country. The other countries that do report cases \u2013 such as South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore \u2013 rapidly identify those who are infected, trace the people they have contacted, isolate the carriers of the virus and contain its spread. Through this three-pronged strategy \u2013 test, trace, isolate \u2013 eradication is successful.

The virus is remarkably dangerous \u2013 it spreads as easily as a cold or flu, even via individuals who don\u2019t have any visible symptoms, and the latest data shows that roughly 5% of people who become infected will require hospitalisation. Among them, 30% will be admitted to ICU.

The United States, which has more than 400,000 cases and approaching 13,000 deaths, has overtaken China, where there have been roughly 82,000 cases and 3,000 deaths. Half of all confirmed cases are now in Europe.<strong> </strong>Low- and middle-income countries are just a few weeks behind. While nations such as Senegal, Liberia and Nigeria have shown themselves aggressively ready to meet this challenge, their governments are constrained by a lack of resources, healthcare and testing capacity. Others, such as Brazil, India and Mexico, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/04/medics-in-brazil-fear-official-coronavirus-tally-ignores-a-mountain-of-deaths\">seem in denial</a> of what is to come.</p> <p>We still don\u2019t know what percentage of the world\u2019s population<strong> </strong>has already been exposed to the virus. Without a reliable antibody test that can identify whether someone has had the virus and are likely to be immune, it\u2019s unclear how many people are carrying the virus but not showing symptoms. The role of children in transmission is also unclear; children are neither immune nor seem to be heavily affected.</p> <p>So, what now? Based on what I\u2019ve learned from published modelling and other countries\u2019 responses to the virus, there are four possible scenarios for how this might end. One is that governments come together to agree a plan of eradication dependent on a rapid and cheap point-of-care diagnostic<strong>.</strong> All countries would simultaneously close their borders for an agreed amount of time and mount an aggressive campaign to identify carriers of the virus and prevent transmission.</p> <p>This approach seems unlikely; the virus has spread aggressively, and some countries have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/china-outraged-after-brazil-minister-suggests-covid-19-is-part-of-plan-for-world-domination\">reticent to cooperate</a> with one another. But it could become more realistic for three reasons: antiviral therapies used to prevent or treat symptoms of Covid-19 may be poor; a vaccine may take decades to produce; and immunity may only be short-term, resulting in multiple waves of infection, even within the same individuals. New Zealand is currently attempting a version of this approach; the country has closed its borders, enforced a lockdown and is rolling out community<strong> </strong>testing to eradicate the virus.</p> <p>A second scenario, which seems moderately more likely, is that early vaccine trials are promising. While waiting for the vaccine, countries would try to delay the spread of the virus over the next 12-18 months through intermittent lockdowns. Health authorities would need to anticipate, three weeks in advance, whether there are enough beds, ventilators and staffing to treat those infected. On this basis, governments could decide whether to relax or increase quarantine measures.</p> <p>But this scenario is far from ideal. Healthcare systems would still be strained, and the economic and social costs of lockdown are high. Repeated lockdowns could lead to mass unemployment, an increase in child poverty and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/singing-stops-italy-fear-social-unrest-mount-coronavirus-lockdown\">widespread social unrest</a>. In poorer countries, more people could die from the lockdown than from the virus itself: of malnutrition, vaccine-preventable diseases or dehydration from limited access to clean water.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/08/uk-coronavirus-london--enough-intensive-care-beds-says-sadiq-khan-live-news-boris-johnson\">UK coronavirus live: Boris Johnson 'responding to treatment' in intensive care; Wales to extend lockdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A third and even likelier scenario is that countries follow South Korea\u2019s example while they wait for a vaccine: increase testing to identify all carriers of the virus, trace the people they have contacted, and quarantine them for up to three weeks. This would involve large-scale planning, the swift development of a contact-tracing app,<strong> </strong>and thousands of volunteers to help with swabbing, processing results and monitoring quarantine. More relaxed physical distancing measures could be enforced to prevent the spread of the virus and ease the pressure on healthcare systems.</p> <p>In the absence of a viable vaccine for the foreseeable future, a final scenario could involve managing Covid-19 by treating its symptoms rather than its cause. Health workers could administer antiviral therapies that prevent patients from deteriorating to the point where they needed intensive care, or preventing them from dying when they reach a critical phase. An even better solution would be using prophylactic therapy to prevent the onset of Covid-19, in combination with rapid diagnostic testing to identify those who have been infected. In countries with the resources, this could be sustainable \u2013 but for poorer countries this approach would be difficult, if not impossible.</p> <p>There is no easy solution. The months ahead will involve a fragile balancing act between the interests of public health, society and the economy, with governments more reliant on each other than ever before. While half the battle will be in developing the tools to treat the virus \u2013 a vaccine, antiviral therapies and rapid diagnostic testing \u2013 the other half will be manufacturing enough doses, distributing these in a fair and equitable manner, and ensuring they reach individuals across the world.</p> <ul> <li><p>Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh</p></li> </ul>",

Parliament is fundamental to national values that are deeply entrenched in Australian society: those of respect for democracy and the rule of law \u2013 particularly in times of crisis.</p> \n   <p>In these uncertain times, ensuring transparency, scrutiny and oversight of the government\u2019s response to the Covid-19 crisis is paramount, if the Australian people are to maintain confidence in the parliamentary system.</p> \n   <p>That is why it is so important that the Senate Select Committee has been established.</p> \n   <p>We also call on the Australian Parliament to continue throughout the Covid-19 crisis by the further adoption of technology and other measures.</p> \n   <p>Australians need to see democracy fully in action, not suspended, throughout this crisis.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n

One of the very pleasing elements of the payments that the minister for government services has outlined is that when those payments have come through for Indigenous communities, there has been a very large amount of food in those communities, and that is fantastic, we were so pleased.</p> \n   <p>And I want to thank everybody involved, including the member for Barton, for the messaging that was going into Indigenous communities about how those payments might be used in those circumstances. </p> \n   <p>This was a tremendous result, obviously that has led to some supply shortages going into those communities and I know the minister for Indigenous Australians is working directly with the executive chair of the Covid commission, <strong>Neville Power</strong>,<strong> </strong>to make sure those supply lines of those food stocks going back into those communities is being refreshed as we speak. </p> \n   <p>That is one of the key tasks of the coordination commission \u2013 a group of very successful, very practical problem-solving people from the private sector, who are able to work through logistics issues, food supply chain issues, working out of the ministry of home affairs, <strong>Paul Gibson</strong> is the deputy secretary there, also leading a team working on the supply chain issues, not getting just supplies of food to remote Indigenous communities but also rural communities, regional communities, so we are not just restocking shopping centres and supermarkets in the cities but across the country. Another key issue they are working on is not just supplying the big supermarkets and big shopping centres but corner stores \u2013 we want people to stay home and we don\u2019t want them going too far for what they need. In Indigenous communities they have no choice.</p> \n   <p>I want to commend the chief minister Gunner for the great job he is doing in the Northern Territory in securing these communities, but getting through to them is an important task and I can assure the member that the Covid commission working together with the minister for Indigenous affairs is working with the premiers of the states to make sure supply lines are replenished and support will be in place for those communities.</p> \n   <p>Of all the issues we discussed at national cabinet, our biggest concern of all the vulnerable communities in Australia is Indigenous communities. Recently I spoke to prime minister Trudeau and it is a similar issue in Canada for the remote Indigenous communities in Canada. We are employing very similar measures, we had a good discussion about that, to protect, insulate but maintain supply of support to those communities, not just food but essential services whether it be health, or indeed protection for people in those communities.

We expect the government debt burden to weaken materially as a result.</p> \n  <p><strong>We have revised our outlook on Australia to negative from stable to reflect a substantial deterioration of its fiscal headroom at the AAA rating level.</strong> At the same time, we are affirming our AAA/A-1+ long- and short-term local and foreign currency ratings.<br></p> \n  <p>Our ratings on Australia benefit from the country\u2019s strong institutional settings, its wealthy economy, and monetary policy flexibility. <strong>The country\u2019s high external and household indebtedness as well as its vulnerability to weak commodity export demand moderate these strengths.</strong></p> \n  <p><strong>Rating Action</strong><br></p> \n  <p>On April 8, 2020, S&amp;P Global Ratings revised the outlook on its long-term ratings on <a href=\"https://app.ratings.spglobal.com/x0T0040u28f0gFM0erhwlSg\">Australia</a> to negative from stable.

With household indebtedness at elevated levels, this could delay the process of repairing the government balance sheet beyond what we expect currently. Government indebtedness and interest costs will remain at elevated levels.</p> \n  <p><strong>Upside scenario</strong></p> \n  <p>The outlook could revert to stable if the general government fiscal balance improves in line with our expectations as the economy recovers or if Australia\u2019s external position improves. Stronger fiscal and external positions would provide the sovereign with a buffer to absorb another potential economic or financial shock.</p> \n  <p><strong>Rationale</strong></p> \n  <p>The Covid-19 outbreak has dealt Australia a severe economic and fiscal shock. We expect the Australian economy to plunge into recession for the first time in almost 30 years, causing a substantial deterioration of the government\u2019s fiscal headroom at the AAA rating level. The large budget deficits that we project in fiscal years 2020 and 2021 are likely temporary and do not represent a structural weakening of fiscal performance. Net government debt and relative interest cost nevertheless are likely to remain at elevated levels for a number of years.</p> \n  <p>Along with its strong institutions, a credible monetary policy, and floating exchange-rate regime, Australia\u2019s typically strong fiscal performance remains a credit strength for the rating. Australia meanwhile remains susceptible to vulnerabilities associated with its high external and household indebtedness.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-08T01:44:38.900Z\">at 2.44am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8d23678f085d226cfd4d7d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-08T01:07:58.589Z\">2.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>There seem to be more text messages going around \u2013 this one seems to be labelled \u201cAusGov\u201d instead of \u201cTelstra\u201d which should be less confusing.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Paul_Karp/status/1247692416930312194\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Australian govt Easter corona text.

  "<p>The people of London have always been settlers from around the world, beginning with the Roman invaders who founded the city. While the growth of the imperial capital until 1945 largely depended on migrants from other parts of Britain, it also included Europeans, especially Jews, Germans, and, above all the Irish.</p> <p>The multicultural capital that exists today has continued to depend on Europeans but people from the wider world. My own parents moved to the heart of empire in its dying days, from Cyprus, and <a href=\"https://yalebooks.co.uk/display.asp?k=9780300210972\">my interest</a> evolved from this connection to a still great global capital.</p> <p>Those who have written about the people of London, especially its ethnic diversity, have included authors telling their own life stories, countless novelists, journalists and other observers, a selection of whom I outline below. Collectively, they reveal the modern history of London, providing an insight into its ethnic and social diversity.</p> <p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://springfieldcollege.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15370coll2/id/2111/\">Memoirs of the Life of Daniel Mendoza</a></strong><em><strong> </strong></em><strong>(1816)</strong><br>London has acted as home to countless sportsmen, especially fighters and footballers, many of who have produced autobiographies. Daniel Mendoza, born in Aldgate in 1765, wrote this pioneering account of his life, which involved punching his way out of the Jewish East End to become British champion in an era when Jewish boxers became well-known celebrities, with Mendoza developing something of a cult, partly due to his ability to publicise his activities, especially through his biography.</p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/16/rereading-henry-mayhew-london-poor\">London Labour and the London Poor by Henry Mayhew</a> (1861)<br></strong>It proves impossible to understand the evolution of modern London without reading Henry Mayhew, who interviewed people in the early Victorian streets involved in all types of work and, above all, allowed them to speak for themselves, making him a pioneer both in the history of journalism, as his pieces first appeared in the Morning Chronicle, and in social science research. Mayhew\u2019s interviewees and the detailed research which he carried out, provide us with information on all manner of lower-class occupations, especially on the hawkers selling everything from recycled tea bags to fried fish. Mayhew offers a panorama of working-class life largely as told by the people of London themselves.</p> <p><strong>3. <a href=\"https://booth.lse.ac.uk/learn-more/what-was-the-inquiry\">Life and Labour of the People in London by Charles Booth</a> (1892)</strong><br>Much more academic in tone and not providing the people of London with the same opportunity as Mayhew does to speak for themselves, anybody trying to understand late Victorian London has to at least dip into this multi-volume survey of the capital, the first research project which used a large team, including Beatrice Potter, to provide a scientific account of the population of London, complete with numerous maps outlining the income of the different areas of the capital, as well as providing an insight into ethnicity and work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b0bf4ff3d63a85c4d9a4ccaeb0eb64f89bf014a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b0bf4ff3d63a85c4d9a4ccaeb0eb64f89bf014a/0_0_5161_3096/1000.jpg\" alt=\"a room at the newly Museum of London, showing Charles Booth\u2019s Map Descriptive of London Poverty in 1891.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A room at the Museum of London, showing Charles Booth\u2019s 1891 Descriptive Map of London Poverty.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/livinglondonitsw02sims/page/n6/mode/2up\">Living London, edited by George R Sims</a> (1902-3)</strong><br>While those interested in Victorian London will certainly know the work of Mayhew and Booth, they may not have come across the magnificent collection of essays brought together by George R Sims and published at the very end of the old queen\u2019s reign. Consisting of a series of short essays about the city, \u201cits work and its play, its humour and its pathos, its sights and its scenes\u201d, reveals virtually every aspect of the life of London at the beginning of the 20th century. The essays range from Waterside London to Underground London and Ballooning London. The book also includes at least one sketch on each of the major migrant groups in the capital.</p> <p><strong>5. <a href=\"https://jewishmuseum.org.uk/2018/03/22/life-in-the-east-end-israel-zangwills-the/\">Children of the Ghetto by Israel Zangwill</a> (1902)</strong> <br>This offers a literary account of life in the Jewish East End at the beginning of the 20th century, an alternative view to the antisemitic discourse which blighted early 20th century Britain focusing, in a fictive treatment, on the reality of Jewish life in late Victorian London allowing us an understanding of identity, integration and work.</p> <p><strong>6. <a href=\"https://www.irishcentral.com/roots/diary-of-an-exile-remarkable-irish-construction-worker-in-britain-232324901-237788201\">An Irish Navvy: The Diary of an Exile by Donall MacAmlaigh</a> (1964) </strong>originally appeared in an Irish version (as the inside front cover of the 2018 edition states) and offers an insight into the life of the hundreds of thousands of Irish males who helped to build London from the Victorian period until the end of the 20th century. While MacAmlaigh moved around Britain, his account of his working life demonstrates precarity for a labourer at the lower end of the social scale, as well as the hard work involved, therefore reflecting not simply the lives of other Irishmen but also the reality of labouring for millions of people in the British capital.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec4fe63ed6d8b70a6acb72c0ac63a78d9ed2900a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec4fe63ed6d8b70a6acb72c0ac63a78d9ed2900a/0_69_1690_1014/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Small Island by Andrea Levy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Naomie Harris and David Oyelowo in the BBC\u2019s adaptation of Small Island by Andrea Levy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steffan Hill/Ruby Television</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>7. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jan/08/small-island-andrea-levy-bookclub\">Small Island by Andrea Levy</a> (2004)</strong><br>One of the best fictional accounts of the realities of life in wartime and early postwar London for West Indian migrants to the heart of empire, tracing racism, which trumped social status with regard to the way in which the white British reacted to the new arrivals, despite the relatively positive reception for West Indian servicemen during the second world war. The novel also offers an insight into the social and economic realities of London life in the 1940s and 1950s for all ethnic groups.</p> <p><strong>8. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/oct/12/featuresreviews.guardianreview31\">White Teeth by Zadie Smith</a> (2000)</strong><br>Smith\u2019s novel takes us forward from the experiences faced by first generation immigrants in Small Island to the realities of multi-ethnic London at the end of the century. It is told through the lives of migrants and their children, in which ethnic diversity and ethnic mixing became part of the everyday realities of life for all Londoners, whatever their background, a process which had become normalised by the 1960s and which has roots throughout London\u2019s history. White Teeth offers a brilliant literary account of these processes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/13/top-10-books-about-building-cities-jonathan-carr-make-me-a-city\">Top 10 books about building cities | Jonathan Carr</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>9. <a href=\"https://www.austinmacauley.com/book/one-way-ticket-autobiography-london-cypriot\">One Way Ticket: The Autobiography of a London Cypriot by Fotis Loizou</a></strong> <strong>(2019)</strong> <br>This memoir recounts the experiences of a member of one of the largest migrant groups in early postwar London. Fotis moved to the city in 1957 as a child with his parents and sister. The book does not simply tell the story of the problems of assimilation and integration which we might expect from an account of this nature, but also demonstrates the fact that Cypriots could face the type of violent racism experienced by all ethnic groups in London, as happened to his father following the murder of a British soldier in Cyprus. Fotis also recounts his own experiences of facing racists at a bus stop in Camden Town when Enoch Powell reached the height of his popularity.</p> <p><strong>10. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jan/14/historybooks.features1\">London in the Nineteenth Century: A Human Awful Wonder of God by Jerry White</a> (2006) </strong><br> I could just as easily have recommended this author\u2019s accounts of London in the 18th century and in the 20th.

Along with his neighbours, he was assaulted by the police while queueing to buy provisions. He spoke of \u201cthe constantly changing announcements on social restrictions, the abandonment of government responsibility to secure supply chains, the threatening of desperate people with military-style responses, and the crushing of small businesses which define rural life in Goa\u201d. These were the decisions of panicked politicians.

  "<p>Here\u2019s a 60-minute cine-essay from the American experimental artist-animator Jodie Mack; a distinctively trippy travelogue about \u2026 well, what? The film may have something to say about globalisation and homogeneity. Or our 21st-century addiction to consuming stuff. Maybe there\u2019s an observation here on cultural appropriation. But with no words or narrative, this hypnotic kaleidoscope of repeated patterns and animation featuring brightly coloured fabrics is all but unclassifiable. Mack is known for working with textiles, and this film, shot on 16mm, is perhaps best described as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/dec/15/my-favourite-film-koyaanisqatsi\">Koyaanisqatsi</a> with rugs.</p> <p>The footage has a grabbed-on-the hoof feel, filmed around the world. In a stop-motion scene at the start, a mutinous wheelie case, broken free from a display in a shopping mall, spluts out scraps of fabric. Again in stop-motion, a rug slinks creepily down a flight of stairs: a carpet possessed. Cheapo skirts hang on a stall at an outdoor market. Maps, alphabets, symbols and sheet music are also recurring motifs \u2013 the systems humans use to make sense of the world.</p> <p>To be honest, the artistry of Mack\u2019s painstaking animation is lost in translation to the small screen, the fabrics pixellated to a blur. The DIY soundtrack is a trance-y smorgasbord of traffic noises, bippy-boppy electronic beats, birdsong, the clanks and rhythmic whirs of industrial sewing machines, and even that universal sound of connectivity, the Skype ringtone. (It ends playfully with the first instance of a human noise, a honking great sneeze.)</p> <p>The Grand Bizarre is a film that will alienate many with its video-artiness but the focus here on looking and looking again with wonder at the everyday stuff around us may strike a chord at the moment. Saying that, so many scenes filmed on trains, boats and balconies, in India, Mexico and Morocco, may leave you with a pang of desire for that whoomph of heat you get stepping off a plane some scorching destination.</p> <p>\u2022 The Grand Bizarre is available on <a href=\"https://mubi.com/films/the-grand-bizarre\">Mubi</a> from 9 April.</p>",
  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> \n<h2>WHO \u2018deeply concerned\u2019 over Europe spread</h2> \n<p>The World Health Organization has said it is \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d over the development of Covid-19 in Europe. Regional director Dr Hans Henri P Kluge said the continent accounted for about half of confirmed cases globally and warned governments against relaxing lockdown measures.</p> \n<h2>Spain daily death rate slows</h2> \n<p>Spain has reported 757 deaths in the past 24 hours, a slight increase from the 743 deaths reported one day earlier. The virus has now claimed 14,555 lives in the country. But this week has seen the daily death toll grow by 5%, compared with around 9% one week earlier. \u201cWe have reached the peak of the curve and we are in a slowdown phase,\u201d the country\u2019s health minister, Salvador Illa, told parliament.</p> \n<h2>Mumbai extends lockdown</h2> \n<p>Mumbai is to extend its current lockdown until at least 30 April. The city, which has a population of more than 20 million, has become the country\u2019s coronavirus centre. Other parts of India are scheduled to lift restrictions on Tuesday.</p> \n<h2>Boris Johnson remains in hospital</h2> \n<p>The UK is \u201cnowhere near lifting the lockdown\u201d, according to the London mayor. Sadiq Khan made the comments as the prime minister Boris Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/boris-johnson-to-stay-in-hospital-amid-concerns-over-political-vacuum\">remained in intensive care</a> with symptoms of the virus.</p> \n<h2>Concern over food shortages</h2> \n<p>Singapore has announced plans to boost food production amid concerns over shortages. As part of the plans, the city-state, which only produces 10% of its food need, will turn car park rooftops into urban farms.</p> \n<h2>Italy closes ports to migrant ships</h2> \n<p>Italy has closed its ports to migrant ships because of the epidemic. The decision, made by the government late last night, means charity migrant boats can no longer dock.</p> \n<h2>Refugee camps threatened</h2> \n<p>Concerns are mounting over the spread of the virus in Greek refugee camps. The government has said new asylum requests will not be examined during the crisis, leaving thousands trapped in camps. A total of 1,832 cases have been confirmed in the country.</p>",
  "<p>In this unprecedented moment in American history, we need an unprecedented legislative response. President Trump is incapable of providing leadership, and instead continues to mislead the public and act out of political self-interest. So it is Congress that must lead, and it must do so now.</p> <p>With anxiety growing, everyone in our country needs to know that, in the midst of this horrific pandemic and economic meltdown, their government is doing everything possible to keep them healthy and financially secure.</p> <p>In other words, we need to build upon and expand the recent stimulus package with new and bolder emergency legislation which must be passed as soon as possible. Here are a few core principles that must be included in that legislation.</p> <p>First, Congress must explicitly authorize that the Defense Production Act is fully utilized to demand that the private sector start delivering the equipment and products that our medical personnel desperately need in order to treat their patients. We cannot rely on Trump to do it.</p> <p>Recent reporting has revealed that the Trump administration did not start ordering crucial equipment like masks until March. It is beyond comprehension that, in the wealthiest nation on Earth, doctors and nurses throughout the country are putting their lives on the line because they lack an adequate supply of surgical masks, gloves and gowns. We must also produce the ventilators as well as the various kinds of testing kits that we need now and will need in the future, as well as the dwindling supply of certain prescription drugs that are essential to treat the virus. States and hospitals should not have to compete against each other. The federal government must take the lead in coordinating efforts.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Now more than any point in recent history, we are in this together. We must act with love, compassion and urgency</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Further, during this crisis, every American must be able to receive all of the healthcare they need regardless of income. Before the pandemic, 87 million people were uninsured or underinsured. That number is rapidly escalating as millions of workers are not only losing their jobs but are also losing their employer-based health insurance.</p> <p>The cost of hospital treatment for the coronavirus amounts to tens of thousands of dollars. Tragically, we have already seen people who have delayed treatment due to concerns about cost. In this pandemic, lack of insurance will lead to more deaths and more Covid-19 transmissions.</p> <p>As long as this pandemic continues, Medicare must be empowered to pay all of the deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket healthcare expenses for the uninsured and the underinsured. No one in America who is sick, regardless of immigration status, should be afraid to seek the medical treatment they need during this national crisis.</p> <p>Obviously, Congress must not only address the pandemic crisis, it must also act with a fierce sense of urgency to effectively deal with the economic crisis as well.</p> <p>In the last two weeks, a record-breaking 10 million people filed unemployment claims \u2013 more than during the entire 2008 Great Recession. Frighteningly, the St Louis Federal Reserve projects that 47 million more people may become unemployed by the end of June, with unemployment reaching 32%. While such estimates may be a worst-case scenario, the reality of the pandemic has taught us that worst-case scenarios are what we must plan for. For the sake of working families all over this country, we must be prepared for all contingencies.</p> <p>We cannot wait before taking the bold action that is necessary. In my view, it makes a lot more sense to prevent the collapse of our economy than figuring out how we put it back together after it crumbles. Simply stated, that means that every worker must keep receiving his or her paycheck and benefits during the crisis. In the recent emergency relief bill, Congress appropriated over $25bn in grants to the airline companies so that 2 million workers in that industry will continue to receive their full paycheck and benefits through 30 September. And that is exactly what we must do for every worker in America. This is not a radical idea. It is similar to what France, Norway, Denmark, the UK and other countries are doing.</p> <p>Further, as quickly as possible, we must get money into the hands of people by immediately providing a $2,000 monthly emergency payment to every person in the country until the crisis has passed.</p> <p>In addition, we must guarantee paid medical and sick leave to all workers. It has been estimated that only 12% of workers in businesses that are likely to stay open during this crisis are receiving paid sick leave benefits as a result of the second coronavirus relief package. We have got to increase this figure to 100%.</p> <p>Moreover, workers who are on the frontlines of this crisis including those who work in grocery stores, warehouses, paramedics, nurses, pharmacies, domestic workers, postal workers, farm workers, public transit, truck drivers and janitors must receive $500 a week hazard pay, childcare and a safe and secure workplace.</p> <p>Finally, we must put an immediate moratorium on evictions, foreclosures and utility shut-offs, and suspend payments on rent and mortgage loans for primary residences during this crisis.</p> <p>This is a frightening and devastating time for our country, and the world. Never before in our lifetimes have we had to deal with both a public health pandemic and an economic meltdown.</p> <p>The American people deserve and require leadership from Washington that acts aggressively, puts working people first, and provides peace-of-mind to the most vulnerable people in our country. Now more than any point in recent history, we are in this together. We must act with love, compassion and urgency.</p> <p>Historians will look back at this time to see how we dealt with this unprecedented crisis. I hope they will observe that we responded with the courage and boldness that the moment required.</p> <ul> <li><p>Bernie Sanders is US senator from Vermont and a Democratic presidential candidate</p></li> </ul>",
  "<h2>Eire salutes the republic</h2> <p><strong>Day of modified rejoicing: two sorts of disapproval and a mass of indifference</strong><br>From our special correspondent<br>18 April 1949</p> <p><em>Dublin, Monday, 1 am<br></em>The first ceremonies to mark the promulgation of the Republic of Ireland Act to-day took place in Dublin at midnight, when a salute of 21 guns and a feu de joie were fired from O\u2019Connell Bridge. The main civil, military, and religious ceremonies are at noon to-day at the Pro-Cathedral and at the General Post Office in Dublin.</p> <p>Dublin is crowded, though not all the visitors are \u201cup for the Republic,\u201d and not more than one in ten is wearing any of the Republican emblems which are being hawked in the streets. Although the crowds were calm throughout the day they became a little more excited towards midnight and collected in thousands round O\u2019Connell Bridge. At 11 45 p.m. it seemed impossible that the guns, riflemen, and band would ever get into position, for the crowd had overflowed rather than forced its way past the police cordon and had occupied all the open space which should have held the ceremonial troops.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/20/republic-fight-irish-independence-townshend-review\">The Republic: the Fight for Irish Independence 1918-1923 by Charles Townshend \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>A republic is born</strong><br>In spite of this there was a delay of only two minutes in the start of the ceremony. The guns flashed and boomed, firing across O\u2019Connell Bridge in the direction of Liberty Hall, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/from-the-archive-blog/2016/mar/30/1916-easter-rising-guardian-reports-archive\">in 1916 was shelled by British guns</a> which were not loaded with blank rounds. After the salute riflemen performed their feu de joie, the band played the national anthem, and the crowd began to disperse, waving flags, cheering, and singing. For once a republic had been born without bloodshed \u2013 at least in this case the blood had been shed 33 years ago.</p> <p>At Dun Laoghaire the ceremony was rather more naval than military. A flag was raised at the end of one of the piers and was illuminated by searchlights from craft in the harbour. A naval guard of honour presented arms and the National Anthem was played.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d36c03f57bc77372cfb0a9d51880552a9ffe039a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d36c03f57bc77372cfb0a9d51880552a9ffe039a/0_0_2656_3924/677..jpg\" alt=\"Sean T Kelly, president of Ireland, takes the salute at the parade celebrating Ireland\u2019s status as an independent republic, 1949.\" width=\"677\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sean T Kelly, president of Ireland, takes the salute at the parade celebrating Ireland\u2019s status as an independent republic, 1949.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Irish military genius, which has so often been expended in the service of other nations (especially of England), will have a chance to express itself in the march past the President outside the General Post Office. The parade will be partly mechanised and will include a unit of the small naval service, two battalions of the local defence force, infantry, anti-aircraft gunners, sappers, signallers, field artillery, and a field ambulance. The centrepiece of the ceremony will be the hoisting of the tricolour on the Post Office, where it flew for those few days in 1916 which made the Republic of to-day possible.</p> <p>Although to-day marks an important step in Eire\u2019s national evolution the celebrations are being taken calmly by most people and coldly by some. The public buildings \u2013 except for the Post Office \u2013 are not decorated; the Dublin Corporation thought it inappropriate to spend even the product of a farthing rate on marking an occasion of which so many members disapproved. No flags have appeared on Trinity College, but the tricolour is flying almost everywhere else with the Papal Flag and the banners of the four provinces \u2013 so even Ulster is playing a part.</p> <p>There have been rumours that some young extremists might put up a counter-demonstration to mark disapproval of partition but even this anti-partitionist feeling is not being very loudly proclaimed, and the only anti-British slogans to be seen are chalked up in Irish on the walls. They call for an end to the use of the English language. The celebrations have also incurred the disapproval of those who are less than Unionists but who are still aware of what Eire gained from the slender Commonwealth connection. This feeling is strong but not organised. Between these two wings there are the people, probably the majority, who do not care one way or the other.</p> <p>The atmosphere is, then, not exactly jubilant here, and if it were not for the marching soldiers, the artillery salutes, and the fireworks to-day would pass like any other Bank Holiday and certainly not like a national festival</p> <p><strong>Fianna Fail stands aloof</strong><br>It might have been a different matter if the Fianna Fail party were not withholding its support, and if Mr De Valera were at the saluting base (he is taking no part in the celebrations). But the Coalition Government has not found it easy to work up enthusiasm for a constitutional change which was not part of its mandate from the voters in the last general election, and which, it has been suggested, would hardly have got a majority in the country if it had been put to the test of a referendum; even the 1937 Constitution, which was Republican in everything but name, was not passed by an overwhelming majority, and things have changed in Western Europe since then.</p> <p>But to-day the political differences may sink below the surface for an hour, and the achievement of the 1916 leaders may be remembered in its historic rather than in its party context. They and not the present Government will be in the minds of to-day\u2019s crowds \u2013 at least among the people who have any sense of Ireland\u2019s past and what it was that Pearse, Connolly, MacDonagh, and the others died for.</p> <h2>Truncheons out in Tyrone</h2> <p>18 Apri 1949</p> <p>In the village of Carrickmore, County Tyrone (Northern Ireland), 500 young men who had assembled yesterday for a Gaelic football match were warned by the police that they could not march in procession. In spite of this they went to a field and sang \u201cA Soldier\u2019s Song\u201d and were hoisting the Republican flag when the police dispersed them with truncheons. Several men were injured.</p> <h2>Editorial: The Republic</h2> <p>18 April 1949</p> <p>The new chapter in Irish history begins to-day without interrupting the flow of life more than a birthday or a silver wedding. <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/41\">The Republic of Ireland Act</a> and the consequent withdrawal of Eire from the Commonwealth are generally regretted here, but more regretted than resented; one does not have to be very deeply versed in Irish affairs to know something of the inner compulsions which move her statesmen. Though the struggle which made the Republic possible ended nearly thirty years ago and its echoes have died away, to-day\u2019s leaders took their share in it as young men; it was for most of them the great, the formative, experience of their lives; they found themselves moved by irresistible currents of courage and generous idealism.</p> <blockquote> <p>All changed, changed utterly; <br>A terrible beauty is born.</p> </blockquote> <p>Such a struggle generates deeper passions than served to start it, and these have run too deep to be satisfied with an outcome which might have been welcome enough if it had been more easily reached. They have run their course at last. The companions and disciples of Pearse and Connolly may turn now with a clear conscience to the not less pressing social problems of their country, and to its proper place among the free nations of the world. It will be well if they can apply to these the same spirit of selfless service which moved their old leaders at Easter, 1916.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/16/united-ireland-brexit-irish-unification-back-on-agenda\">Talk of a united Ireland is rife.

The only part of the ceremony which seemed to make any emotional impression on the spectators was the hoisting of the tricolour on the General Post Office in O\u2019Connell Street, where thirty-three years ago the Easter rising began. When the flag went up it was greeted with cheers and waving hats and small banners. There was for the moment a touch of the fervency which broke out when the guns were fired at midnight on O\u2019Connell Bridge.</p> <p>But the parade which followed the flag-raising, put on with the utmost military efficiency, seemed to leave the spectators unmoved, though they roused themselves to a few ragged cheers and handclaps when the naval detachment marched past with a decided swagger. This does not mean that Dublin was not enjoying the parade; it seems to be a characteristic of an Irish crowd that although it enjoys the pomp and circumstance of soldiering and watches with an expert eye it will not rise to the occasion by throwing metaphorical caps over imaginary windmills.</p> <p><strong>A brave display</strong><br>Even a regimental sergeant major of the Brigade of Guards could not have found much fault with the turnout and drill of the troops, and he might well have searched for a superlative to describe the smartness of the presidential guard of honour of officer cadets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eac692c12bef0066f64015a3e6f36b122cc331b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eac692c12bef0066f64015a3e6f36b122cc331b3/0_0_1672_2048/816..jpg\" alt=\"Ireland\u2019s president Sean O\u2019Kelly reviewing the guard of honour on Easter Sunday, Ireland\u2019s independence day.\" width=\"816\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ireland\u2019s president Sean O\u2019Kelly reviewing the guard of honour on Easter Sunday, Ireland\u2019s independence day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Larry Burrows/The LIFE Picture Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sean-T-OKelly\">President O\u2019Kelly </a>sat on his stand in front of the Post Office surrounded by the Diplomatic Corps and other distinguished guests. who had arrived in a procession of unusually democratic appearance. The top hat, the cocked hat, the trilby and the cloth cap marched together; the shining dress uniform of the soldier (and even of the senior policeman) walked with the academic robe, the municipal gown, and the well-worn lounge suit \u2013 and there were, of course, priests of various orders in black clerical suits or the brown habits and sandals of the friars.</p> <p>There was no single figure to catch the imagination of the crowd, though there was a ripple of applause for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._T._Cosgrave\">Mr Cosgrave</a> and an affectionate cheer for Alderman \u201cAlfie\u201d Byrne, Dublin\u2019s most famous ex-Lord Mayor. The President and Taoiseach were received with due respect, but it was difficult not to think what might have happened if Mr De Valera had changed his mind and turned up at the last minute. It was not so much Hamlet without the Prince as a large and loyal family without any father \u2013 but perhaps it is a virtue of the republican idea that there is no individual on whom the crowd can fix its eyes and swoon.</p> <p>After the ceremonies the Taoiseach held a press conference in the main hail of the post office \u2013 the hall which was the nerve-centre of the Easter rising \u2013 in which he said nothing which has not been said often before on the subject of partition and of the longing (south of the border) for a united Ireland. It was not an occasion for profound statements of policy, but later in the day in a broadcast Mr Costello said what must have been in the minds of many Irishmen to-day:</p> <blockquote> <p>We have put ourselves apart but not cut ourselves adrift from our former association with the great nations of the Commonwealth. We have severed the formal links but have not sundered the intangible bonds that exist between us.

This was an insuperable obstacle because some of the Irish counties were occupied by British forces.

The period led to inspired bouts of experimentation (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkF05D-NJMU\">she soundtracked a sci-fi film</a>) as well as patience-testing indulgences (a 21-minute antiwar song on her 1973 album Where Are You Now, My Son?). Diamonds and Rust was the crowning achievement of her imperial period and one of the best singer-songwriter albums of the 70s.</p> <p>The crystalline voice that had made Baez the first lady of folk-rock had weathered into a warmer tone, and a kaleidoscope of genres including rock, jazz and soul added new colours to her maturing Washington Square sound. A stately take on<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/06/stevie-wonder-where-to-start-in-his-back-catalogue\"> Stevie Wonder</a>\u2019s ballad <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idXLnuCsirg\">I Never Dreamed You\u2019d Leave in Summer</a> evokes the closing credits of a prestige weepie, while on the freewheeling Joni Mitchell duet Dida, the two singers\u2019 voices swoop like swallows at dusk.</p> <p>Baez had butted heads with the 60s women\u2019s movement, particularly for appearing on <a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/564x/bc/66/08/bc6608047069398940123ddccc53f83b.jpg\">a cheeky anti-Vietnam conscription poster</a> that stated: \u201cGIRLS SAY YES to boys who say NO.\u201d But Diamonds and Rust platforms women\u2019s stories in its own way. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhrGLlgqtw0\">Children and All That Jazz</a> is a collaboration with the jazz virtuoso Hampton Hawes where Baez\u2019s stream-of-consciousness lyrics describe the mindset of a frazzled mother \u2013 a perspective rarely made space for in \u201cserious\u201d art \u2013 her vocals doing soprano trapeze-work among the flurries of instrumentation.</p> <p>She is also unafraid to skewer the mythos of the scene that made her. The album\u2019s title track is Baez\u2019s greatest song, a clear-eyed postmortem of her romantic relationship with Bob Dylan that details rapturous highs and a novel\u2019s worth of small cruelties. \u201cAs I remember your eyes were bluer than robin\u2019s eggs / My poetry was lousy, you said,\u201d she sings, her voice curdling. There\u2019s more than a hint of that bruised sentiment in the \u201cman child\u201d poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/lana-del-rey\">Lana Del Rey</a> described on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/20/best-albums-2019-no-1-lana-del-rey-norman-fucking-rockwell\">Norman Fucking Rockwell</a>, an artistic synergy confirmed by Del Rey and Baez\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5PXH7T27Q\">exquisite live performance of Diamonds and Rust</a> last year.</p> <h2>The three albums to listen to next</h2> <p><strong>Joan Baez/5 (1964)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6omDSxTCXE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/b6omDSxTCXE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>There\u2019s a strange, theremin-like purity to Baez\u2019s singing voice in the traditional songs of her 1960 self-titled album that has led many critics to name it the best of her output that decade. Yet her outlaw taste and versatile abilities are more visible on Joan Baez/5, which includes singular takes on songs written by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/johnnycash\">Johnny Cash</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/bobdylan\">Bob Dylan</a>, as well as a cut-glass cover of protest singer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/26/phil-ochs-the-doomed-folk-singer-who-woke-up-from-the-american-dream#comments\">Phil Ochs</a>\u2019 There But for Fortune (it was Baez\u2019s first UK Top 10 hit). Her embrace of global genres from Brazilian baroque to 18th-century English folk deeply intuitive here, while her version of Dylan\u2019s It Ain\u2019t Me Babe is sung as both a lament and a warning, perhaps as a sign of the couple\u2019s souring relationship. Baez was beginning to show her teeth.</p> <p><strong>Come From the Shadows (1972)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0sXNmKhGKo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/n0sXNmKhGKo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>While Baez was a force in the 60s anti-war movement and a civil rights advocate, politics hit her closer to home in 1969 when her husband, the anti-war journalist <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/23/opinion/vietnam-war-draft-protests.html\">David Harris,</a> was jailed for draft evasion. The resulting album, Come From the Shadows, had Americana flourishes, a folk soul, and was unambiguously in conversation with 70s rock. In the Quiet Morning is an ecstatic elegy for Janis Joplin, the stately piano of Rainbow Road recalls classic Elton John, while To Bobby calls out Bob Dylan for his lapsed activism (<a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/flashback-joan-baez-pleads-with-bob-dylan-via-song-236296/\">he was unamused</a>). Most stunningly, Baez is reinvented as a country empath in Prison Trilogy (Billy Rose), recruiting a cast of Nashville musicians in a call-out of police brutality and the inhuman treatment of undocumented immigrants, climaxing in a grave call to action: \u201cHelp us raze the prisons to the ground.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Whistle Down the Wind (2018)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5-e4qqvKck\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/B5-e4qqvKck?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Joan Baez: Whistle Down the Wind \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>With a deeper vocal range and steely point of view, Baez\u2019s 25th and (supposedly) final album is a late-period victory lap with eyes firmly on the here-and-now. These 10 covers span genres and epochs, peaking with the moving title track, a Tom Waits cover on which Baez sings of a life misspent in husky, mournful tones. She also updates an Anohni ballad for today\u2019s climate emergency, while a cover of Zoe Mulford\u2019s The President Sang Amazing Grace, a song about the in 2015, is a masterclass of teeth-gritted grace. Baez\u2019s fundamental optimism is intact even as she surveys the wreckage of the world. \u201cIt\u2019s the bitter end we\u2019ve come down to,\u201d she sings over uplifting piano. \u201cThe eye of the needle that we gotta get through.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>One for the heads</strong></h2> <p><strong>The Altar Boy and the Thief (from Blowin\u2019 Away, 1977)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOP5l7zL4Js\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mOP5l7zL4Js?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>In the late 70s, Baez was an outspoken opponent of the Briggs initiative, a cruel proposal to ban gay and lesbian people from working in California schools. Her LGBTQ+ allyship was vividly brought to life in The Altar Boy and the Thief, a spare piano ballad from 1977\u2019s Blowin\u2019 Away. Inspired by the Pink Elephant, her local Santa Monica gay nightspot, Baez immortalises the bar\u2019s open cruising and queens with \u201cfinely plucked eyebrows and skin of satin\u201d in a cry for the rights of queer+ communities to live \u201cunshamed\u201d.

most operators were offering a credit rather than a refund, and \u201cthis was probably fine\u201d unless the terms under which the ticket were sold said the customer could get a refund.</p> <p>One big tour company, APT, is <a href=\"https://www.aptouring.com.au/about-us/travel-updates\">now offering a travel credit</a> to customers whose trips have been cancelled because of the pandemic, even

It\u2019s hardly surprising, however, that the industries wholly dependent on public engagement are the most endangered.</p> <p>The creative industry was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/21/coronavirus-leaves-roadies-and-events-crew-devastated-its-the-first-industry-to-stop-dead\">the first hit by Covid-19</a>.

The overwhelming majority are not employed fulltime. The industry\u2019s self-generated income has disappeared. And yet the majority of companies and casuals won\u2019t be able to access any stimulus or income support announced to date.</p> <p>Bookshops, galleries, museums, theatres and cinemas all over Australia have been closed by government order. Festivals, residencies, regional and international tours have been cancelled. And rightly so: we all need to take very good care right now. Yet while the aviation industry \u2013 which is just a sixth our size \u2013 was given a $750m package a couple of weeks ago, nothing has been offered to the industry that inspires the nation and the world.</p> <p>So why that perilous gap? What makes the industry so unique?</p> <p>The creative and cultural industries contribute $111.7bn to GDP, compared with aviation\u2019s $18bn. Unlike aviation, our cash flows don\u2019t follow steady daily and monthly patterns, and so it\u2019s hard to demonstrate our downturn. Festivals, art fairs and biennials, for example, transact 80% of their year\u2019s turnover within just a few months.</p> <p>That means that the past few months don\u2019t yet show the downturn; it hasn\u2019t happened yet in dollar terms, even though it\u2019s absolutely happened in real terms. Or they might have received a grant in advance of an exhibition or event that\u2019s already been cancelled. It\u2019s hard to show that that money can\u2019t go towards current staffing.</p> <p>Those creative businesses who are still operating are experiencing a slow burn, not a sharp downturn, as the rest of their year\u2019s program and income disappears. So we can expect to see that 47% figure reduced further by the time the ABS next releases its stats.</p> <p>On top of all that, there are galleries and theatres all over regional and suburban Australia that are owned by local, state or federal government. No income support has been announced for them.</p> <p>Last week, <a href=\"https://www.paulfletcher.com.au/media-releases/media-release-jobkeeper-payment-to-keep-the-spotlights-shining-in-the-arts-sector\">a government media release claimed</a> that the jobkeeper package would \u201ckeep the spotlights shining in the arts sector\u201d because \u201cmost organisations\u201d would be eligible.</p> <p><a href=\"https://visualarts.net.au/news-opinion/2020/letter-federal-and-state-ministers-re-covid-19/\">The industry has been united in making it clear</a> that this is very much not the case.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.broadsheet.com.au/sydney/entertainment/article/leave-ghost-light-me-age-old-theatre-tradition-illuminating-sydneys-stages-during-coronavirus-era\">It\u2019s ghostlights, not spotlights</a>, in our theatres and galleries across Australia right now.</p> <p>Companies who can\u2019t demonstrate their downturn across just the past couple of months can\u2019t access the jobkeeper payment that allows them to retain staff.

Migrant workers on visas can\u2019t access any support at all \u2013 and despite the taxes they pay through all their hard work, they can\u2019t even access healthcare.</p> <p>Despite business, industry and union groups all over Australia seeking the inclusion of all workers in income support measures, the government has dismissed calls to protect a million of our most vulnerable workers.

Last week the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provided the drug with an \u201cemergency use authorization\u201d to use on coronavirus patients in some circumstances. State officials in New York have said that about 4,000 seriously ill patients are now being treated with the drug. But experts say it\u2019s too early to call it a cure. </p> <p><strong>What is hydroxychloroquine?</strong><br></p> <p>Hydroxychloroquine, also known by its brand name, Plaquenil, is a drug used to treat malaria. It is a less toxic version of chloroquine, another malaria drug, which itself is related to quinine, an ingredient in tonic water.</p> <p>It is also readily available to Americans \u2013 already approved as a malaria and anti-inflammation treatment by the FDA \u2013 where it is an off-the-shelf drug with various low-cost generic versions. Despite the emergency use order, the FDA has not conducted clinical trials to fully ascertain whether the drug is an effective treatment for Covid-19.</p> <p><strong>Why is Trump touting it?</strong></p> <p>Trump was influenced by a widely publicized study in France where 40 coronavirus patients were given hydroxychloroquine, with more than half experiencing the clearing of their airways within three to six days. This apparent improvement is important as it would curtail the timeframe in which infected people could spread Covid-19 to others.</p> <p>However, experts have warned that the study is small and lacks sufficient rigor to be classed as evidence of a potential treatment. The French health ministry has warned against the use of hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19, with Olivier V\u00e9ran, France\u2019s health minister, saying that it shouldn\u2019t be used by anyone with the exception of \u201cserious forms of hospitalization and on the collegial decision of doctors and under strict medical supervision\u201d.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-07T22:45:23.093Z\">at 11.45pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e8cff588f08008f0919edd3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-07T22:37:08.967Z\">11.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Trump is again touting hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, which has not yet been proven effective against the coronavirus. </p> <p>The repeated a story about a Democratic state lawmaker who credits hydroxychloroquine and Trump for her recovery from Covid-19. \u201cI really think it\u2019s a great thing to try, just based on what I know,\u201d he said. \u201cAgain, I\u2019m not a doctor.

For three weeks, I had been quarantined in my apartment in DC-- away from everyone, including my family, who has been home in Miami. It has not been an easy journey. There were moments when I thought I was recovering, but then the fever would return. Thankfully, I never experienced shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, or issues with my heart. I treated my symptoms with Tylenol and a lot of rest. I want to share my experience to emphasize the seriousness of this virus and reiterate that you should continue to follow CDC and local health guidelines, including social distancing. I have no idea how, when, or where I was exposed to the virus, despite being extremely careful and constantly washing and sanitizing my hands. On Sunday, after being deemed Coronavirus-free by my doctor, I was able to reunite with my family in Miami. While still a little weak, I feel well. I applied to donate my plasma to help those suffering from #COVID19 infections. If you have also recovered from the virus, I encourage you to sign up to donate\u2014it could save a life. I reiterate my profound gratitude to the nurses, scientists, doctors, first responders, our military, and all the men and women on the frontlines of this pandemic. We will always be thankful for their heroism, sacrifice, courage, and dedication.</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/repmariodb/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart</a> (@repmariodb) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2020-04-07T18:20:58+00:00\">Apr 7, 2020 at 11:20am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> </figure>  <p>Congressman <strong>Mario Diaz-Balart </strong>said he has reunited with his family in Miami after spending three weeks in Washington as he recovered from the virus.</p> <p>\u201cIt has not been an easy journey,\u201d the congressman wrote in an Instagram post. \u201cThere were moments when I thought I was recovering, but then the fever would return.

They show that even within the Trump administration alarm bells were ringing loudly by late January, at a time when the president was consistently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/04/trump-coronavirus-science-analysis\">downplaying</a> the threat of Covid-19.</p> <p>The memos, <strong>first reported by the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/us/politics/navarro-warning-trump-coronavirus.html?action=click&amp;module=Spotlight&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">New York Times</a> and <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/exclusive-navarro-deaths-coronavirus-memos-january-da3f08fb-dce1-4f69-89b5-ea048f8382a9.html\">Axios</a></strong>, were written by Navarro on 29 January and 23 February. The first memo, composed on the day Trump set up a White House coronavirus task force, gave a worst-case scenario of the virus killing more than half a million Americans.</p> <p>According to the Times, it said: \u201cThe lack of immune protection or an existing cure or vaccine would leave Americans defenseless in the case of a full-blown coronavirus outbreak on US soil. This lack of protection elevates the risk of the coronavirus evolving into a full-blown pandemic, imperiling the lives of millions of Americans.\u201d</p> <p>The second memo went even further, predicting that a Covid-19 pandemic, left unchecked, could kill 1.2m Americans and infect as many as 100m.</p> <p>This was not the first time Trump and his White House team were warned that the virus had the potential to devastate the US and needed to be dealt with quickly and firmly. Senior scientists, epidemiologists, and health emergency experts in the US and around the world delivered that message clearly early on in the crisis, only for Trump to continue belittling the scale of the threat which he compared falsely to the dangers of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/24/trump-again-downplays-coronavirus-by-comparing-it-seasonal-flu-its-not-fair-comparison/\">seasonal flu</a>.</p> <p>But the emergence of the memos from such a senior aide within the White House will make it much more difficult for Trump to claim \u2013 as he has done on <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2020/03/30/trump_on_coronavirus_nobody_could_have_predicted_something_like_this.html\">multiple occasions</a> \u2013 that nobody was able to predict the severity of the disease.
