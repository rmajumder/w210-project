  "<p>Western Australia experienced unusually heavy and torrential rain along with severe wind gusts last weekend, as the remnants of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/25/western-australia-perth-storm-50000-homes-without-power-as-state-battered-by-wild-weather\">Tropical Cyclone Mangga</a> tracked along western coastal areas. The tropical cyclone transitioned to extra-tropical before reaching the westernmost lands of Australia, but its interaction with an active cold front gave it new strength and it hit the coast with gusts close to 75mph and rainfall totals of more than 40mm on Sunday 24 May.</p> <p>Meanwhile, southern parts of Italy experienced a record-breaking heatwave between 13 and 16 May, as extremely hot south-easterly sirocco winds caused temperatures to rise above 35C (95F) in three regions. One of the hottest places was around Palermo, on the north coast of Sicily, where temperatures were as high as 34C at 3am, and reached 38-40C, breaking the May national record of 36.8C set in 2008. Temperatures at Palermo\u2013Boccadifalco airport peaked at 38.6C on the 13th, 38.8C on the 14th and 39.1C on the 16th.</p> <p>Finally, a series of severe thunderstorms occurred in Texas during the night of 23 May. Four tornados were reported close to the border with Oklahoma, and another thunderstorm produced a giant hailstone measuring 5.33in (13.5cm) in diameter, which landed inside a house after falling through the roof.</p>",
  "<p>The New South Wales government has quietly paid out millions of dollars to more than a dozen former schoolchildren who it admits were abused by a paedophile teacher who rose through the ranks of the state\u2019s public school system over three decades while preying on young Indigenous boys.</p> <p>Since April 2018 lawyers from the state\u2019s education department have signed out-of-court settlements with 14 men from across western <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/new-south-wales\">NSW</a>.

The investigation found evidence to suggest that O\u2019Connor, better known as Clete, used his almost unchecked power and standing in western NSW throughout his career to systematically groom and abuse young Indigenous boys.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Can you imagine if this was a black man doing this to little white boys? \u2026 They\u2019d have strung him up</p> <footer> <cite>Abuse victim</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>O\u2019Connor, who died in 1995, remains well respected by some in the towns where he worked.

All of the survivors who the Guardian spoke to described lifelong battles with depression and addiction, and a deeply ingrained mistrust of white authority.</p> <p>The case highlights systemic historical failures within the public school system to protect children and marks another dark chapter in relations between white and Indigenous Australia. Lawyers acting for O\u2019Connor\u2019s victims argued that the state had, in effect, \u201charboured\u201d a serial paedophile for decades, and questioned how his \u201cflagrant\u201d abuse could have gone unchecked for so long.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"308643ada38bc32574cda1639232953a5fe82c51\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/308643ada38bc32574cda1639232953a5fe82c51/0_0_2000_2930/683.jpg\" alt=\"Cletus O\u2019Connor worked as a teacher, principal and schools inspector in NSW from the 1950s to the 1980s.\" width=\"683\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">O\u2019Connor cultivated an image of being willing to mentor younger colleagues, but students swapped lurid stories about him.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gilgandra high school yearbook</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As one victim said to the Guardian: \u201cCan you imagine if this was a black man doing this to little white boys?

No charges were laid and, in a statement, the Department of Education said it \u201cdid not become aware of complaints made against O\u2019Connor before he died\u201d. Victims told the Guardian they recalled seeing photographs of O\u2019Connor on the wall of a NSW public school as late as 2015.</p> <p>The NSW education department refused to disclose how much it had paid out in the 14 settlements, but the Guardian understands the figure runs into the millions.

Most of the former associates of O\u2019Connor\u2019s in Gilgandra contacted for this story angrily rejected specific questions about his conduct and all of them denied any knowledge of his offending.

I think it was paedophilia \u2013 grooming young males, that\u2019s what I understood it to be. Whether it went further, I couldn\u2019t say, I just don\u2019t know. It was a third-, fourth-hand type of thing, that\u2019s really all I know.</p> <p>\u201cWith that sort of thing, you hear rumours, and you, well, I\u2019m thinking now, well, maybe you\u2019d react differently these days but this is 35 years ago. I might hear a rumour but as a classroom teacher, you know, he\u2019s an inspector, and you think, \u2018That\u2019s not my prerogative.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d309ca31298a3d8c8f9d8564c69a591e2eeb4079\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d309ca31298a3d8c8f9d8564c69a591e2eeb4079/0_0_6571_4381/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Western Plains cultural centre, formerly Dubbo high school\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Western Plains cultural centre, formerly Dubbo high school.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carly Earl/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During the legal process, victims alleged O\u2019Connor regularly signed them out of class during school hours, took them on overnight excursions to other towns in western NSW where he abused them in hotel rooms, and was often seen driving Indigenous boys around town in his car.</p> <p>According to multiple sources, much of the alleged abuse took place in the Department of Education building where O\u2019Connor worked on Carrington Avenue.</p> <p>One survivor recalled O\u2019Connor paying particular interest in Indigenous students at Dubbo high school.</p> <p>A separate unfiled court document prepared on behalf of the survivor said that when he was a year seven student, O\u2019Connor had begun approaching him \u201cin the playground or in the park across the road from the school\u201d to talk to him about his schooling. He had started giving him \u201ca couple of dollars here and there\u201d and paying for school lunches.</p> <p>The survivor recounted that initially the attention had made him feel \u201cspecial\u201d but that as time went on O\u2019Connor had become more \u201ctouchy\u201d. Under the guise of tutelage, O\u2019Connor had started taking the boy to his home office in Dubbo or to the building in Carrington Avenue.</p> <p>The survivor alleged that on the first occasion when the abuse took place, O\u2019Connor had left him alone in a room with pornography \u201cand upon returning asked questions about how he felt\u201d before physically abusing him.</p> <p>While it remains unclear how widely O\u2019Connor\u2019s alleged abuse was known about and what, if anything, was done to prevent it, lawyers acting for victims found that complaints had been filed against O\u2019Connor with police in 1986, the year he retired, but that no charges had been laid.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We used to call each other \u2018Clete\u2019 as a way of ribbing each other, as all teenagers do</p> <footer> <cite>Former Dubbo high school student Brendan McCann</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Guardian contacted the NSW police, who said they were unable to confirm the complaint. It is understood that at least one police officer had attempted to investigate complaints made against O\u2019Connor.</p> <p>But dozens of interviews with victims, their family members, former colleagues and other teachers who came in contact with O\u2019Connor during his long career reveal that rumours about the abuse were widely circulated before and after his retirement.</p> <p>Those rumours had spread widely enough that when Brendan McCann enrolled at Dubbo high school as a teenager in 1986, \u201cClete\u201d was being used as a derogatory nickname by students.</p> <p>\u201cWe used to call each other \u2018Clete\u2019 as a way of ribbing each other, as all teenagers do,\u201d McCann, who now lives in Spain, told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cIt meant \u2018gay\u2019 and I just accepted it, as you do at that age. We\u2019d call each other \u2018Clete\u2019 or \u2018Clete O\u2019Connor\u2019 for a slightly stronger effect \u2026 we\u2019d say, \u2018Yeah, good on ya, Clete,\u2019 or, \u2018Good one, Clete.\u2019 Always very sarcastic, of course.\u201d</p> <p>McCann did not know who O\u2019Connor was, or about the rumours of his abuse, and assumed the name was fictitious until he asked a friend about its origins. \u201cAt some point I asked a mate of mine who he was and he said he was a gay bloke in town,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Other rumours were more explicit. In the early 80s, Robin Church remembers being at home while her teenage son was playing with friends.

I don\u2019t remember his exact words, no, but [I remember] him saying Clete was paying these little Aboriginal boys for sex. I thought, \u2018Oh! I never knew anything about that.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Peter Dargin is a former western region school inspector who worked for the department at the same time as O\u2019Connor. Though they were both based in the same office in Dubbo, he spent much of his time on the road and the two \u201cweren\u2019t friendly\u201d.</p> <p>But in the mid 80s, not long after O\u2019Connor retired, Dargin remembers seeing a piece of graffiti spraypainted in black on a wall near the Carrington Avenue building.</p> <p>It read: \u201cGive money Clete.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was quite obvious, you couldn\u2019t miss it,\u201d Dargin said. \u201cIt was quite unnerving because at the time I thought that the kids were taking advantage of Clete, like it was a demand.</p> <p>\u201cBut later somebody said they thought Cletus had something to do with Aboriginal boys. I was shocked. I thought it was hard to believe.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018We lost our education\u2019</strong></h2> <p>The cases raise significant concerns about the way the civil justice system operates for victims of child sexual abuse who come from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p> <p>Though none of the survivors interviewed for this story felt ready to speak about their abuse publicly, multiple interviews and a review of legal documents and medical records obtained with their permission detail the devastating legacy the abuse has had on their lives.</p> <p>Most have struggled with alcohol and drug addiction and describe deep and lasting psychological injuries. One survivor vividly described his inability to show intimacy towards his children, including not feeling comfortable bathing them as infants or allowing them to hug him or sit on his lap.</p> <p>Another told the Guardian he had been unable to maintain intimate relationships throughout his life as a result of the abuse, and described lifelong alcohol abuse beginning about the age of 12 when he said he would drink before school because it was \u201cthe only way I could escape as I had nobody at home to help me\u201d.</p> <p>Though the victims have received financial settlements and an acknowledgement of the abuse from the Department of Education, the men who spoke to the Guardian feel justice has not and perhaps never can be done.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>These poor blokes are going to have a harder time showing economic loss because of the reality of what it means to be Aboriginal in Australia</p> <footer> <cite>Jason Parkinson, lawyer</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like throwing a rock into a river,\u201d one survivor said. \u201cHow do you stop the ripples? And how do you stop the rock from sinking?</p> <p>\u201cWe lost our education from the abuse, we lost a lot of things. Their apologies hasn\u2019t helped.\u201d</p> <p>Jason Parkinson, a lawyer from Porters Lawyers who specialises in child abuse cases, said race and class play a significant role in determining settlement payments because, while general damages were guided by common law, payments made on the basis of economic loss took individual circumstances into account.<strong><br><br></strong>\u201cEconomic loss is the big-ticket item but it\u2019s personal to each individual\u2019s case,\u201d he said. <br><br>\u201cAnd that\u2019s the tragedy of these cases. Generally, because of the way Australian society is, these poor blokes are going to have a harder time showing economic loss because of the reality of what it means to be Aboriginal in Australia. Generally speaking, if you\u2019re from a well-off family with high-achieving parents and siblings, and you were sexually abused by a Catholic priest, you\u2019re going to have an easier time showing economic loss because of your changed circumstances.<br><br>\u201cAnother thing is that, virtually as soon as you go to jail you\u2019re stuffed for economic loss. So even though a person was pushed down the wrong path because of the abuse, it hurts them later when negotiating an economic loss settlement.\u201d <br><br>Parkinson makes a point of issuing a writ to the supreme court on every case \u201cto show that we\u2019re serious\u201d but said it wasn\u2019t unusual for cases like the one uncovered by the Guardian to never reach a courtroom. <strong><br><br></strong>\u201cIf I was a defendant\u2019s lawyer, the first thing I would do is look to see whether the plaintiff has the hallmarks of child sexual abuse, a history of depression, PTSD, alcoholism \u2013 all of that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when that is recorded throughout the medical records I\u2019m going to say, \u2018OK, I\u2019m satisfied that happened,\u2019 because you can\u2019t fake that.<br><br>\u201cThen when you see there\u2019s another 14 of these men that\u2019s when you say, \u2018OK, on the balance of probabilities our guy did it and he\u2019s our agent, let\u2019s settle this before it gets to court.\u2019<strong><br><br></strong>\u201cIt\u2019s never simple, but the reason you\u2019re not seeing cases where people ride up the courthouse steps on a white steed to have their day in court is that the defendants know they\u2019re done for and they settle for enough money before it reaches that stage.\u201d</p> <p>The Department of Education did not answer questions about what steps it had taken to investigate the claims before it had agreed to settle the cases, saying they were subject to privilege. But documents seen by Guardian Australia show the department unequivocally accepted the abuse occurred.</p> <p>In a statement, a spokesman for the department said: \u201cWe agreed to settle cases consistent with the requirements of the NSW government\u2019s 19 principles for handling such cases and the model litigant policy. The requirements include settling them out of court and utilising a trauma-informed approach.</p> <p>\u201cThe model litigant policy provides we settle claims promptly, pay legitimate claims without litigation, and endeavour to avoid litigation where possible.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Do you know more? michael.mcgowan@theguardian.com</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: Lifeline 13 11 14; Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467; Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800; MensLine Australia 1300 78 99 78; Beyond Blue 1300 22 4636.

  "<p>Boris Johnson endured a long and sometimes difficult first appearance before the liaison committee of senior MPs. Here\u2019s some of the things we learned:</p> \n<h2>He doesn\u2019t want an investigation into Dominic Cummings</h2> \n<p>The first long section of the appearance was dominated by questions about the apparent breach of lockdown regulations by Johnson\u2019s chief adviser, and the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/27/boris-johnson-grilled-by-mps-over-dominic-cummings-lockdown-breach\"> PM could hardly have been less keen to engage</a>, saying several times that people should \u201cmove on\u201d. Johnson also declined to order an investigation into the matter by the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, or to share evidence about what Cummings may or may not have done. Johnson said he did not want to \u201cshuffle this into the hands of officials\u201d.</p> \n<p>He did say several times that \u201ca lot\u201d of the media coverage of the affair had been false, but when invited to set out what had been wrong, Johnson said he did not wish to discuss this.</p> \n<h2>The two-metre distancing rule could be relaxed</h2> \n<p>Asked about this by the Tory MP Greg Clark, who chairs the science and technology committee, the prime minister said he hoped it could be reduced, which would aid public transport, and pubs and restaurants.</p> \n<p>\u201cMy own hope is that as we make progress in getting the virus down, in reducing the incidence, we will be able to reduce that distance, which I think will be particularly valuable in transport and clearly the hospitality sector,\u201d he said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/27/uk-coronavirus-live-tory-revolt-continues-to-build-over-dominic-cummings-lockdown-trip\">UK coronavirus live: Johnson tells people to move on from Cummings row amid launch of test-and-trace strategy</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>When Clark asked if he could instruct the government\u2019s Sage scientific advisory committee to look into the issue, Johnson said: \u201cI cannot only make that commitment, I can tell you I\u2019ve already done just that.\u201d</p> \n<h2>He seems uncertain about the \u2018no recourse to public funds\u2019 rule</h2> \n<p>No recourse to public funds, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/07/home-offices-denial-of-benefits-to-migrant-families-unlawful-court-rules\">NRPF</a>, is a condition placed on some people who enter the UK from other countries and have a temporary immigration status, which means you can\u2019t claim most benefits. It has faced new scrutiny amid the Covid-19 outbreak, with many people out of work.</p> \n<p>Stephen Timms, the Labour MP who chairs the work and pensions committee, told Johnson about a family with two children in his East Ham constituency who faced \u201cdestitution\u201d after the father lost his job, with the mother\u2019s income being less than their rent. \u201cThey have leave to remain in the UK but no recourse to public funds, so they can\u2019t get any help at all,\u201d Timms said.</p> \n<p>Apparently unclear about how NRPF operates, Johnson asked why they were not eligible for benefits like universal credit, with Timms having to explain their situation again, and what NRPF involves.</p> \n<p>Johnson said he would look at how the scheme works: \u201cYou\u2019ve raised a very, very important point if a condition of their leave to remain is that they should have no recourse to public funds. I will find out how many there are in that position, and we will see what we can do to help.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Test, track and trace did not happen at first due to lack of testing</h2> \n<p>This has been strongly hinted at before by government scientific advisers, but answering questions from Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary who now chairs the health committee, Johnson was very open.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe did have a test, track and trace operation but unfortunately we did not have the capacity in Public Health England,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cTo be absolutely blunt, we didn\u2019t have the enzymes, we didn\u2019t have the test kits, we just didn\u2019t have the volume, nor did we have enough experienced trackers ready to mount the kind of operation they did in some other east Asian countries, for instance,\u201d he said.</p> \n<h2><strong>He would like more women at the daily Covid-19 press conferences</strong></h2> \n<p>Quizzed by Caroline Nokes, the Tory MP who chairs the women and equalities committee, Johnson said: \u201cIt\u2019s certainly true that I would have liked to have had more female representation at the press conferences so far.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked by Nokes how many women would be \u201cenough\u201d representation, Johnson appeared to laugh, and was reprimanded by Bernard Jenkin, the Conservative who chairs the liaison committee, who reminded him this was a serious matter.</p> \n<p>While some of the scientists at the press conferences have been women, among the ministers, only the home secretary, Priti Patel, has appeared on occasions.</p>",
  "<p>White police officer <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/what-we-know-about-derek-chauvin-and-tou-thao-two-of-the-officers-caught-on-tape-in-the-death-of-george-floyd/570777632/\">Derek Chauvin</a> pinned George Floyd to the concrete as he hollered that he could not breathe. George screamed. Screamed for his mother. Screamed for his breath. For his life.</p> <p>For many watching the footage, George\u2019s cries echoed Eric Garner\u2019s \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d New York police department officer Daniel Pantaleo killed Garner a couple of weeks before a Ferguson police officer killed Michael Brown. George\u2019s plea reminds me of another black man shot by police: Eric Harris. In 2015, Tulsa reserve deputy Robert Bates told Harris \u201cfuck your breath\u201d.&nbsp;That same year, Fairfax county law enforcement tased Natasha McKenna four times while she sought help during a mental health crisis. As they were brutalizing her, she said, \u201cYou promised you wouldn\u2019t kill me.\u201d For me, the image of the white officer kneeling into George\u2019s back reminds me most of Freddie Gray. Baltimore police severed Gray\u2019s spine through an intentional rough ride in the back of a police van.</p> <p>George, like <a href=\"https://www.vibe.com/2020/05/sean-reed-black-man-killed-by-indianapolis-police\">Dreasjon Reed</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/police-killing-of-breonna-taylor-fuels-calls-to-end-no-knock-warrants-11590332400\">Breonna Taylor</a> and other black people killed by police this year, should be alive and breathing. This cycle \u2013 murder, protest, calls for justice, non-indictments \u2013 is revelatory. We must join others to reduce police power before, during and after these viral killings. Police reform is not enough. We need abolition.</p> <p>In recent years, news stories broke about how Immigrations and Customs Enforcement use raids, detentions and deportations to threaten immigrants in the US. Calls to \u201cAbolish Ice\u201d could be heard from the streets to the halls of Congress. Ironically, there were no calls to have more Latino and black Ice agents. Mayors did not call for community-driven deportation or raids, like we see for community policing. Non-profits did not call to strengthen relationships between border patrol and immigrants; cities did not fund Ice and ice-cream trucks to pass out treats to immigrant children. Liberals did not point out that there were good apples and bad apples in border patrol enforcement. These programs cannot reform Ice, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/10/15/alex-vitale-interview-the-end-of-policing/\">nor can they reform police.</a></p> <p>If we can understand that the calls to abolish Ice actually means that this country needs a new, transformational immigration system, then why dismiss police abolition as a viable option for a transformative society?&nbsp;</p> <p>One major difference is the mainstream narrative around dreamers: immigrants hoping for a better life and fleeing persecution and violence in their homeland. To be clear, the fight for immigrant justice is crucial and inseparable from the fight against racial police violence. Immigrants, especially undocumented black immigrants, are vulnerable to police violence and face the risk of prison, deportation and death. Yet black Americans, like indigenous and First Nations people, represent particular reminders that white settlers looted land, committed genocide and enslaved people to build a democracy. As a result, black and indigenous bodies remain a public nuisance to be disappeared, exploited, imprisoned and killed by white people and police alike. They want us to live in constant fear of those possibilities for a reason. Thus, black resistance matters, against police and white supremacy alike.</p> <p>Abolitionist organizers in Minnesota are informed by a history of resistance that dates back to&nbsp;1867 when the Minneapolis police department was first formed to surveil black people and Native Americans. Since then, MPD has murdered or beaten black people \u201csavagely\u201d for acts ranging from inviting white women to a dance to refusing to \u201cmove on\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.mpd150.com/wp-content/themes/mpd150/assets/mpd150_report.pdf\">Per a report </a>by MPD150, the Minneapolis police department has garnered several accolades over time, including the nation\u2019s most homophobic police department at one point. In recent memory, officers in the city arrested black people at rates 10 times higher than white people for the same offenses.</p> <p>After a Minneapolis police department officer shot and killed Jamar Clark in 2015, activists occupied their local police department for more than two weeks. This activism spurred organizing that continued after the cameras went away. Through struggle, organizations like MPD150 and Reclaim the Block pushed the mayor and city council to shift more than <a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/11/30/mpls-budget-amendment-removes-million-dollars-police\">$1m from police departments </a>to communities. Unquestionably, this organizing since 2015 influenced the mayor\u2019s unprecedented decision to ensure that the police chief fired all four officers responsible for George Floyd\u2019s killing, almost immediately after it happened.&nbsp;</p> <p>The story is not over. On Tuesday night, <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/nation-world/ct-nw-minneapolis-protests-george-floyd-20200527-ix72khibnvayjcelxpmbo6uvc4-story.html\">MPD teargassed</a> and shot rubber bullets at protesters who took to the streets to decry the murder. The fact that residents were willing to risk their lives during a global pandemic to protest against this injustice demonstrates that the race is not given to the swift nor the strong, but to the organizers who resist until the end.</p> <ul> <li><p>Derecka Purnell is a movement lawyer, activist and Guardian US columnist.</p></li> </ul>",

On I Gotcha Back, GZA solemnly shakes his head at the struggles he sees in his home borough, Brooklyn: \u201cCould\u2019ve wrote a book with a title Age 12 and Going Through Hell.\u201d Coupled with the wicked beauty of the beats, it adds up to the greatest album to ever be stamped with the Wu symbol.</p> <p><strong>Ghostface Killah \u2013 Supreme Clientele (Epic/Sony/Razor Sharp, 2000)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnCAIEN-OVc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XnCAIEN-OVc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Ghostface Killah: Mighty Healthy \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The Clan entered the new millennium with cracks in their armour. The solo records released following second group album Wu-Tang Forever hadn\u2019t resonated. Then came Ghostface Killah\u2019s Supreme Clientele. Recorded after a self-imposed exile in Benin \u2013 where he sought relief from diabetes outside of western medicine \u2013 Ghost gave a clinic in outlandish rapping that plays like an abstract art piece swaddled in street scripture and comic-book lore. The English language has never felt so limitless \u2013 the opening verse of first song Nutmeg alone sees Ghost reference John McEnroe, compare kids caught up in the American legal system to Rapunzel and picture himself opulently \u201clamping in the throne with King Tut hat\u201d \u2013 while the beats evolve the Wu\u2019s grainy style to more bitter noir orchestrals, prominent samples and outlandish experimentation. Being in a legendary group dominates many great artists\u2019 legacies, but Ghostface Killah has forged the broadest and best solo discography of any rapper to emerge from the 36 Chambers.</p> <p><strong>Wu-Tang Clan \u2013 8 Diagrams (SRC/Universal Motown, 2007)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1vs1mCXOXw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/videoseries?wmode=opaque&list=PLAwgd_whiAX8cAgFQE_lCqYmfBGGpFCki\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Wu-Tang Clan: Campfire \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The narratives around 8 Diagrams have to an extent overwhelmed the music. That members of the Clan were unhappy with the direction RZA pulled the album in is part of the unvarnished Wu-Tang history. Building a collection of songs when a group is not united is hardly optimum, so that a classic record emerged feels even more extraordinary. It\u2019s true that RZA was determined to wrench the Clan from the sounds that had defined their legacy, moving towards lusher orchestration. But by retaining the kung-fu mysticism, and with no member slouching in the recording booth, 8 Diagrams always feels like a Wu release. Almost every experiment hits: Campfire is built around what sounds like soldiers humming as they march off to battle, a heavy drumbeat that could have been excavated from an ancient tomb, and a heavy splash of martial-arts movie dialogue. It\u2019s hard to make a case for 8 Diagram\u2019s legacy \u2013 it\u2019s currently the only Wu group album not on streaming services \u2013 but it\u2019s a key document of how RZA pushed them forwards.</p> <h2><strong>One for the heads</strong></h2> <p><strong>Raekwon \u2013 Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...

Young men at the time, they never sounded all that youthful, their voices rippling with ruin, as if they had already seen too much. Released 14 years later, Only Built 4 Cuban Linx ... Pt II sees the duo cast as grizzled street veterans, older and wiser but no less willing to drop their enemies on their heads.</p> <p>The album follows a similarly cinematic outline to the original \u2013 Black Mozart is bold enough to reinterpret the Godfather theme tune. But there\u2019s a bitter dose of reality: on Cold Outside, the pair sullenly contemplate children murdered by their parents or killed by stray bullets. As the 2000s stretched on and Clan members became caught up in other interests, relationships strained and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhUnEg0he4A\">comedy sketches threatened to demystify the music</a>, Raekwon and Ghost continued to make great albums.

  "<p>If you are not going to get out there and pick strawberries, the least you can do is eat them. Britain, farmers tell us, is facing a huge strawberry glut, thanks to the cancellation of major events such as Wimbledon (where 33 tonnes of strawberries were eaten last year), along with thousands of weddings and summer parties. As civic duties go, eating loads of strawberries isn\u2019t that taxing, but they won\u2019t sit around waiting for you to come up with new ways to serve them. Here are 17 delicious ideas to help you manage your personal stockpile.</p> <p>Maceration is step number one in a lot of the recipes below. At its simplest, macerating consists of hulling and halving a quantity of strawberries, tossing them in a bowl with a couple of tablespoons of sugar, then leaving them to sit in the fridge for half an hour or longer, but not long enough for them to turn into mush (meaning not overnight). Additions to the basic formula may include juice (orange or lemon), balsamic vinegar or alcohol.</p> <h2>Cakes and tarts</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a323014525c7c06b3b398d8be44283e368f74484\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a323014525c7c06b3b398d8be44283e368f74484/0_20_3648_2189/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sophisticated ...

Felicity Cloake\u2019s strawberry tart.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A basic strawberry tart, however, requires no maceration. You just make \u2013 or otherwise obtain \u2013 a shortcrust pastry case, fill it with whipped cream or pastry cream (I have had some success with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0y9t2g7PSIw\">this fail-safe Youtube</a> tutorial by Thomas Joseph) and sink sliced strawberries into the top in an orderly spiral. You can get very fussy about sizing fruit for a neat look or, alternatively, not bother.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jul/18/how-to-make-strawberry-tart-recipe\">Felicity Cloake\u2019s strawberry tart</a> is slightly more sophisticated, in that you have to be the sort of person who has rosewater to hand, but it is no more difficult to produce. It also contains a handy recipe-within-a-recipe, for an incredibly useful no-roll shortcrust pastry: you just press the mixture into the tin with the base of a cup.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jun/24/strawberry-recipes-basil-tart-ketchup-sorrel-ice-cream-yotam-ottolenghi\">Yotam Ottolenghi\u2019s strawberry and basil tart</a> has an intriguing combination of strawberries, pistachios and basil-infused pastry cream. It also calls, thankfully, for store-bought puff pastry. Life may not be too short to make your own puff pastry, but the British summer definitely is.</p> <p>Strawberry shortcake is the traditional American way to keep on top of a strawberry glut, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jul/31/how-to-make-strawberry-shortcakes-recipe\">Cloake\u2019s reclaimed British version</a> is excellent. As you will see, strawberry shortcakes are not cakes at all, but individual assemblages of macerated strawberry, whipped cream and large biscuit. However, it is not uncommon in America to make one large one and slice it like a cake. The ingredients are the same, although the amounts might differ since you will probably want three layers for height. <a href=\"https://www.countryliving.com/uk/create/food-and-drink/a21268003/summer-cake-recipe-classic-strawberry-shortcake/#location-choice\">This version</a> has the right proportions.</p> <p>In terms of actual cake, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/21/10-best-summer-recipes\">strawberry and olive oil breakfast cake</a> fits the bill, while <a href=\"https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/strawberry-almond-cheesecake-sponge\">Cassie Best\u2019s strawberry and almond cheesecake sponge</a> could be more accurately described as a sponge with \u201ccheesecake blobs\u201d in it.</p> <h2>Salads</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c0769456910893b00c5aa65441e81bde1e57d9d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0769456910893b00c5aa65441e81bde1e57d9d7/0_201_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Startling combination \u2026 Mark Bittman\u2019s strawberries with rocket.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Startling combination \u2026 Mark Bittman\u2019s strawberries with rocket.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lizzie Mayson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you are like me, it might take you a while to get your head round the idea of using strawberries in salads, especially salads that sound as if they would be just as good without them. But let us not forget why we are here: to level Britain\u2019s massive strawberry mountain before it collapses and buries us all.</p> <p>Here is what I would suggest: before you commit to a whole salad, try a few bites of the relevant flavour combinations first, to see if they work for you. Some will be delightful from the outset; others may be tastes longer in the acquiring. I haven\u2019t yet made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/30/yotam-ottolenghi-strawberry-recipes\">Ottolenghi\u2019s strawberry and tomato salad</a>, but I did put a tomato and a strawberry in my mouth at the same time, and I can testify that they have a surprising affinity.

The major issue with strawberries is their lack of pectin, which causes jam to set. You need to add some, either in the from of other, pectin-rich fruit (lemons, say), or by using jam sugar, which already includes pectin.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.thespruceeats.com/quick-strawberry-compote-recipe-4173397\">Strawberry compote</a> is even simpler and keeps in the fridge for about two weeks.

Hunt recommends macerating the berries in grappa beforehand, but if you don\u2019t have grappa, a little more vodka makes a decent substitute. If you don\u2019t have a proper blender, you can use a hand blender in a tall jug, although you might have to break up the ice a little first. If you haven\u2019t got a jug, just wash out a large vase. You can see I really wanted to make this work. And it did, in the end.</p>",

There are only 2,400 eastern bristlebirds in the wild and about 140 in the Howes Flat population near Mallacoota.</p> \n  <p>They caught the birds, described by the ecologist <strong>Dr Rohan Clarke

speaker would be set up to play the eastern bristlebird\u2019s call and then, when it sounded as if the real birds had approached the speaker, the sound would be remotely switched to a second speaker,

<strong>Josh Taylor</strong> at the bushfire Senate committee hearing ...</p> \n  <p>The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet faced questions at the Senate committee hearing on the 2019-20 bushfires over whether the prime minister, <strong>Scott Morrison</strong>, had been adequately briefed about the bushfires during the fire season last year.<br></p> \n  <p>PM&amp;C hadn\u2019t provided verbal or written briefings to him while he was in Hawaii from 15 to 21 December (he cut his trip short by two days), but that doesn\u2019t rule out the possibility that PMO was updating the PM on the situation.</p> \n  <p>The department secretary, <strong>Phil Gaetjens</strong>,<strong> </strong>told the committee that the PM was in Australia when the fires in Victoria, NSW and South Australia flared up in late November, and back when the state of emergency declarations were made in four states on 30 December, so it was incorrect to say he was absent during the crisis.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a correct interpretation to say that the prime minister was not here in the crisis,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>Gaetjens himself was on leave for half of December, he told the committee.</p> \n  <p>The department confirmed that before Morrison left on holidays in Hawaii he was \u201cvery well informed\u201d about the bushfire situation via a series of teleconference meetings with the head of Emergency Management Australia and others in November.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt seems to me that what you were telling us is that he would have had considerable knowledge about how extreme the crisis was and what was unfolding, yet he still decided to go off on holidays,\u201d the Greens senator <strong>Janet Rice</strong> replied.</p> \n </div> \n <p

The need to fund more domestic places so young people, and the thousands of other Australians whose jobs have disappeared, have tertiary education as a viable option. Past recessions have shown that, as unemployment rates soar, those who cannot earn enrol to learn.<br></p> \n  <p>2. The proposed \u201csafe corridors\u201d to bring international students into Australia needs to be implemented as soon as is safely possible so there is at least some chance of international students getting to Australia and clearing quarantine for the second part of this year. Failure to do this swiftly will add to the devastation of our international education, which contributed $40 billion to our economy each year before COVID-19.<br></p> \n  <p>3. International students, who are already in Australia, should be supported and encouraged to remain here. Community groups, state and local governments and have stepped up to support those who have been hard hit by job losses and exclusion from JobSeeker and JobKeeper. They do however need practical, ongoing help, coordinated at the national level that shows how we value them for their contributions to the Australian economy.</p> \n  <p>4. Cuts of up to 21000 jobs are underway as universities yet the Federal Government has ensured that universities \u2013 unlike other large businesses and some private universities \u2013 are ineligible for the JobKeeper subsidy. This does not make sense.</p> \n  <p>5. Researchers urgently need government assistance to ensure that they can continue and not waste work already done. Many research projects have already been suspended.</p> \n  <p>International researchers, who are very important to the sector, may not return to Australia to finish their work. Much of the $4.7 billion that universities put into research each year has been funded by revenue from international education. That revenue has now evaporated from a sector that is likely to take years to recover.<br></p> \n  <p>6. There is a need to re-start infrastructure projects that have been suspended as universities try to stop their financial haemorrhaging. The Victorian Government has allocated $350 million, which will greatly assist universities with capital projects in that state, but what about the rest of the nation?<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-26T23:25:08.432Z\">at 12.25am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecda35e8f0852d72995058d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-26T23:19:50.747Z\">12.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Hundreds of masks and plastic containers have washed up on Sydney\u2019s eastern beaches overnight.

Gale first got out on a shrimp boat when he was 12. \u201cMama wouldn\u2019t let me go any earlier, but from 12 years on out \u2013 every weekend I wasn\u2019t in school or summer vacation I was on a shrimp boat.\u201d He spent the next 20 years learning from his dad, who shrimped for 45 years.</p> <p>\u201cWhat was an average day like?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d leave about 4.30 in the morning and get to the dragging grounds about 6.30, maybe 7am. I\u2019d put out in daylight, make three or four drags that day. The latest I\u2019d be out would be 4pm,\u201d he says. \u201cLook,\u201d he tells me. \u201cWhat I\u2019m doing right here, right now, selling shrimp on this corner \u2013 it sucks. It\u2019s way better out there on the water. It\u2019s where I\u2019ve lived all my life. If I wasn\u2019t in the ocean, I was in the river running trout lines and catching catfish, or fishing for shad in winter.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Americans eat more shrimp than ever \u2013 an average of 4.4lb per person \u2013 but not all of America\u2019s shrimpers are thriving. Nearly 90% of America\u2019s shrimp comes from overseas, farmed in Asia and Central America, where working conditions and meat quality can be <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/dining/shrimp-sourcing-united-states.html\">repugnant</a>. It is increasingly rare for fresh, wild-caught, chemical-free shrimp to reach an American consumer\u2019s plate.</p> <p>Off the coast of Georgia, fishermen harvested about 2.61m lb of shrimp in 2019, a haul valued more than $11m. Shrimping is deeply ingrained in culture there, but Georgia\u2019s fishermen are facing significant challenges: an ageing workforce, low prices per pound, climate change and <a href=\"https://gacoast.uga.edu/research/major-projects/black-gill/\">black gill disease</a>, leading many to wonder if the industry will survive.</p> <p>These days, depending on the season, Gale can get $3 to $5.50 per lb of shrimp. \u201cBack in the 1980s and 1990s,\u201d he says, \u201cwe were selling the same size shrimp for $8 a pound. We have good years \u2013 but most of the time we have bad years now.\u201d</p> <p>Bryan Fluech, the associate marine extension director at Marine Extension and Georgia Sea Grant, uses the term \u201cgraying of the fleet\u201d when talking about the future of shrimping in Georgia.</p> <p>\u201cShrimp are the Cheetos of the sea,\u201d Fluech tells me. \u201cEverything eats them. But people need to remember: that shrimp didn\u2019t just show up in a Publix.</p> <p>\u201cThe decline of the shrimping industry has been death by a thousand cuts,\u201d Fluech says. \u201cThe cost for maintaining a boat is up, and the boats are getting older. Sustainable fishing practices are expensive to implement. The younger generation doesn\u2019t want to work on a shrimping vessel, and captains tell me they can\u2019t find a reliable workforce. The cost of ice and fuel might rise, but the profit on shrimp doesn\u2019t.

They are so resourceful. You can\u2019t just be a good shrimper any more. You\u2019ve got to be a welder, a businessman and a direct marketer too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeople love to say that they\u2019re all about local food,\u201d Fluech adds. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll see a shrimping boat on every tourism brochure, but commercial waterfronts have changed. People don\u2019t like the look of a working dock. There\u2019s only one left in Brunswick, which means the fishermen have to take those prices or go out on their own. We say we like authentic experiences, but we\u2019re losing them.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>You can see the old reverence for Georgia\u2019s shrimpers in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b59nWMMebho&amp;t=3s\">Blessing of the Fleet</a> ceremonies, which still happen along the coast in towns like Brunswick and Darien at the end of March, as the fleet readies itself for the season.</p> <p>Ships with beautiful names like the Lady Raven, Flying Cloud, Bernice II, Liberty Bell and Sundown arrive at the ceremony decorated with lights and streamers. A crowd gathers, and a minister \u2013 often waving a toilet brush spray-painted gold, and flanked by the Knights of Columbus \u2013 offers a blessing into the microphone. Shrimping is a dangerous vocation, after all, and every year there are injuries, drownings and boats that don\u2019t return.</p> <p>This year\u2019s ceremony was postponed due to the pandemic. The cancellation feels like the latest knock in a long and difficult fight.</p> <p>Once celebrated, many shrimpers feel vilified as they face mounting regulations aimed at preserving other species, like sea turtles. In the 1980s, before turtle excluder devices (TEDs) were prevalent, shrimp nets were responsible for more than 10,000 sea turtle <a href=\"https://modernfarmer.com/2020/01/shrimpers-vs-sea-turtles-the-war-continues/\">deaths</a> annually in the south-east. In 1989, when regulations tightened, shrimpers created a 500-boat blockade in the Gulf coast, raising skull and crossbones flags and even ramming Coast Guard ships.</p> <p>In Georgia, tension between scientists and fishermen is amplified by black gill disease, which affects a shrimp\u2019s respiratory system. The shrimp\u2019s immune response causes the visible blackening of the gills, and results in lethargy, potential death and sometimes the collapse of an entire fishery.</p> <p>Black gill is an expensive problem. In 2019, the commerce department <a href=\"https://coastalgadnr.org/federal-government-announces-1-million-disaster-relief-2013-shrimp-fishery-failure\">distributed</a> over $1m to commercial shrimpers and researchers because of the 2013 white shrimp fishery failure.</p> <p>Black gill is, however, more pervasive than ever. Gale reports that it\u2019s starting earlier in the year, beginning in May instead of August, and continuing throughout fall. Though it has been around since the 1990s, researchers believe the disease is <a href=\"https://www.gpbnews.org/post/black-gill-shrimp-linked-climate-change\">worsening</a> with climate change.</p> <p>Climate change will continue to wreak further havoc on the industry \u2013 changing the salinity of the water, shifting the distribution of shrimp \u2013 female shrimp need colder water to spawn. Warmer winters appear to predict a smaller annual shrimp harvest, and may not kill the bacteria responsible for black gill.</p> <p>Keeping shrimp fisheries healthy, and livelihoods possible, requires intense collaboration between fishermen and scientists. Otherwise, foreign markets with cheap labor and unsustainable practices will take over the market share entirely.</p> <p>\u201cWe <em>have</em> to look for the cooperative path,\u201d Fluech says, emphasizing how helpful it can be when shrimpers help with data collection and reporting. He currently works with five to eight shrimpers each season; the fishermen help report black gill using an online tracking app.</p> <p>One of the best historical examples of this cooperative path is fisherman <a href=\"https://voices.nmfs.noaa.gov/sinkey-boone\">Sinkey Boone</a>, who hailed from a long line of shrimpers in Darien. Boone created the first turtle excluder device in the late 1960s, called the Georgia Jumper, which allowed turtles \u2013 an oxygen-breathing species \u2013 to escape trawler nets so they wouldn\u2019t drown.</p> <p>Scientists and fishermen may seem at odds, but collaboration is possible, and perhaps imperative.</p> <p>\u201cMe and the shrimpers may not agree on everything, but I respect the hell out of them,\u201d says Fluech.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Gale agrees with the saying that shrimpers never retire. \u201cWe fish till we fall out and die,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve seen men fish right on until their 80s and 90s. I know an old man right now who\u2019s got to be 85 and he outworks anybody I know \u2013 still climbs up in the rigging. Diabetic and <em>still</em> goes.\u201d</p> <p>I hear stories about poisonous snakes tangled in anchor lines, boats on fire, near-sinkings, and a man in his 70s impaled by his own equipment who hardly survived, but broke out of the hospital to get back on his boat a few days later.</p> <p>\u201cOnce fishing\u2019s in your blood, and you get used to it, you just don\u2019t want to do anything else,\u201d Gale says.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d still work for my daddy,\u201d Gale tells me. \u201cHe just <em>knew</em> where the shrimp would be \u2013 it was absolutely amazing. He knew the tide cycles, what the weather meant. You could set your watch to it. Another fisherman could make that same pass and miss them.\u201d</p> <p>In 1979, the government issued 1,471 commercial trawling licenses in Georgia \u2013 but only 253 in 2014. If the decline in Georgia\u2019s shrimping continues, the ripple effect will be felt in the local economy, on dinner plates, during seasonal festivals, and on the horizon line, where many are used to seeing early morning trawlers. Frozen foreign shrimp and farmed shrimp \u2013 known as aquaculture \u2013 are the likely future.</p> <p>\u201cDo I think there will always be shrimpers in Georgia?\u201d Fluech asks me. \u201cI hope so. You have to be an eternal optimist in this business.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The human fingerprint on the climate is now unmistakable and will become increasingly evident over the coming decades, the UK Met Office has confirmed after 30 years of pioneering study.</p> <p>Since the 1990s, global temperatures have warmed by half a degree, Arctic sea ice has shrunk by almost 2 million km2, sea-levels have risen by about 10cm and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by 60 parts per million (17%), according to figures exclusively compiled for the Guardian to mark the 30th anniversary of the Met Office\u2019s Hadley Centre for climate science and services.</p> <p>The data highlights how a young generation has grown up in a climate unprecedented in a millennium. Future projections suggest that by mid-century a 60-year-old Briton is likely to be living in a climate 1.2C warmer than when they were born.</p> <p>Scientists at the Hadley Centre, which has been on the global frontline of climate monitoring, research and modelling since it opened in 1990, said early theories about fossil-fuel disruption have been proven by subsequent facts.</p> <p>\u201cThe climate now is completely different from what we had 30 years ago.

Critics, often funded by oil firms, pushed back against climate science because they did not like its political and economic implications. Ahead of the climate summits in Kyoto (1997) and Copenhagen (2009), fossil fuel companies funded misinformation campaigns to cast doubt on climate models.</p> <p>The Hadley Centre remained focused on science. Researchers expanded and refined their models by incorporating new knowledge on biological carbon cycles and the likely impact of fossil fuels not only on temperature, but on Arctic ice, sea-level rise, flooding, storms, droughts and other atmospheric phenomena.</p> <p>Supercomputer advances enabled much greater precision. Early models mapped the impact on grid cells of 300km on each side. Today that is down to 2.2km, which allows detailed predictions of which stretches of river basins and coastlines will need the most protection.</p> <p>Researchers are discovering the impacts go far beyond the initial focus on average temperature. Heat records are being set with increasing frequency. Rainfall patterns are noticeably shifting beyond natural variation. Arctic ice is shrinking faster than expected. The rising seas have already left some places, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/18/this-is-a-wake-up-call-the-villagers-who-could-be-britains-first-climate-refugees\">Fairbourne in Wales</a>, below spring-tide levels.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902g16bjpfxakSN/\" data-alt=\"world temperature graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902g16bjpfxakSN/\">world temperature graphic</a> </figure>  <p>By 2050 \u2013 the year the UK plans to achieve carbon neutrality \u2013 the direct impact on Britain will be moderated by the surrounding ocean and there may be opportunities to plant new crops, but these benefits will be dwarfed by trade disruption, migration, humanitarian disasters and shifting ecosystems.</p> <p>\u201cOverall it\u2019s bad. The negatives outweigh the positives,\u201d said Richard Betts, a Met Office scientist who is leading scientific analysis for the next UK climate change risk assessment. \u201cIt stands to reason that if the world keeps gets hotter and hotter, sooner or later we\u2019ll reach the point where it is first uncomfortable and then hard to function. This won\u2019t be seen in the UK, but in parts of the world that are already hot and humid it could increasingly get too hot to function.\u201d</p> <p>The Hadley supercomputer calculates myriad possible pathways depending on how much carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases enter the atmosphere. The good news is that the worst-emissions scenario, known as RCP 8.5, is considered less likely than before because the global coal industry has not grown as feared. The bad news is current emissions trends (which lie between the RCP 4.5 and RCP 6 pathways) could take the planet to 2C warmer than pre-industrial levels by mid-century, which will increase storm damage, heatwaves, sea-level rise and the already great risk that the Arctic will be ice-free in summer.</p> <p>The climate trends are based on multiple-year averages rather than year-on-year comparisons, which are more subject to natural variation.</p> <p>Even the current best-case scenario \u2013 RCP 2.6, which is roughly in line with the Paris agreement \u2013 would leave the world hotter than today.</p> <p>\u201cWhat stands out is that even in the lowest current scenario, we get warming. We\u2019ll need to prepare and adapt,\u201d says Jason Lowe, the head of climate services at Hadley. He predicts extreme summer heatwaves, such as those seen in 2018, will become the norm rather than an exception.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-39025uyCP6ByMePF/\" data-alt=\"UK temperature graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-39025uyCP6ByMePF/\">UK temperature graphic</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cAs a scientist, I want to narrow the uncertainty so the information is as good as possible so we can plan. I think of the generations to come. I have a nine-year-old daughter. I find myself wondering which of these pathways we will be on when she is 80 or 90.\u201d</p> <p>More extreme results are possible at both ends of the spectrum. The next set of climate assessments will introduce a more ambitious best-case scenario (RCP 1.9) that would mean a faster transition to zero-carbon energy and a greater chance of holding temperature rises below 1.5C. But the situation could worsen rapidly if the climate hits tipping points, such as the collapse of the west Antarctic ice sheet.</p> <p>\u201cThere are still dangers out there that we don\u2019t fully understand,\u201d said Stott. \u201cMuch of the uncertainty lies on the bad side. It could be terrifying. Can we grow enough crops to feed the population? Can we cope if some places are battered by storm after storm?\u201d</p> <p>Such concerns explain why the anniversary cannot be entirely triumphant. Despite growing evidence of climate risks, governments have been slow to act. Apart from downward blips such as the 2008 financial crisis and the coronavirus lockdown, emissions have steadily increased. The Hadley Centre\u2019s work now is not only about predicting impacts, but preparing for them.</p> <p>\u201cReality has proven that what we were saying 20 to 30 years ago was right. As scientists, that is vindication. But on a personal level, I hoped we would track a different emissions trajectory from where we are now,\u201d Stott said.</p> <p>\u201cThe worry is that we are now taking risks globally that we don\u2019t fully understand ... there will be no winners of climate change if we continue.

  "<p>In the ways we have found to talk about the Covid-19 pandemic, the language of heroism is almost as pervasive as that of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/07/horror-coronavirus-real-imaginary-war-britain\">the military campaign</a>. In Britain, nurses, care workers, paramedics, cleaners and doctors are #NHSheroes.</p> <p>Were anthropologists from another world to study the culture of the British archipelago right now, they might assume that the populace worshipped a cult called the NHS, noting how the initials are emblazoned on posters, scrawled on walls and pavements, and even cut into chalk grasslands. They might take notes on the rainbow emblem displayed in household windows (an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apotropaic_mark\">apotropaic device</a>, perhaps?). And they would certainly scrutinise a certain ritual: the moment when, every seven days, the populace emerges from their homes just before nightfall to applaud the frontline workers.</p> <p>The word \u201chero\u201d is slippery, its significance constantly on the move. Where once public discussion about a national crisis might have leaned towards ideas of duty, heroism is today\u2019s dominant public virtue. Over the past 150 years or so it has proved an important means of constructing the idea of the perfect soldier \u2013 brave, masculine, self-sacrificing \u2013 and the language of heroism has certainly been deployed to add lustre to the ugly facts of conflict.</p> <p>The idea of the heroic has also spread pretty generously outwards, well beyond the masculine and the military, at times veering towards the absurd. In an American airport last year, I studied a large display of photographs of the \u201cheroes\u201d who worked there, including the financial risk management director, who was quoted as saying: \u201cI like being able to analyse the profitability of our events and provide information that is helpful to our task.\u201d I am sure he does a highly professional job; \u201cheroism\u201d might be a stretch.</p> <p>Hero is a Greek word \u2013 <em>heros</em> \u2013 and is indelibly associated with ancient myths, especially the Homeric epics. The heroes of the Iliad and the Odyssey, however, are not much like #NHSheroes. In the Iliad, Achilles is the ultimate Greek hero. He is touched with the divine \u2013 his mother is a goddess. His life is brutal and short. He is a mass killer. When his beloved Patroclus is killed, he goes on a vengeful rampage, choking the river Scamander with corpses. By modern standards he is a war criminal.</p> <p>The resourceful, long-suffering Odysseus might seem, at first glance, to feel like a more attractive version of the Greek hero. On the other hand, his modus operandi appears to be one of deceit and trickery punctuated with moments of culpable arrogance, extreme violence and cowardice. When his fleet is attacked by cannibalistic giants, Odysseus orders his own ship\u2019s crew to row away. The others are lost, with all hands. No messing around with \u201cno man left behind\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/15/from-covidiot-to-doomscrolling-how-coronavirus-is-changing-our-language\">Language is unstable</a>. It gathers new force, sheds old connotations. But it can be useful to step back from our familiar understanding of a word; it can help us see what work it is being asked to do in a particular context. Those hypothetical anthropologists might soon, when deepening their study, stumble across a paradox.</p> <p>The NHS, they would discover, is not a wealthy cult; the equivalent of its temple treasuries are not heaped with gold. Many of the people who are clapping in the streets have voted for successive Conservative governments who have starved it of resources. Might the people\u2019s clapping therefore be more complicated than an expression of simple praise for its \u201cheroes\u201d? Perhaps, for some, it might serve as a ritual expiation of guilt.</p> <p>The anthropologists, if they asked the healthcare workers in question, might also find that many are deeply <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/21/nhs-doctor-enough-people-clapping\">uncomfortable with their \u201cheroic\u201d status</a>. One GP based in Edinburgh told me he understood the impulse to reach for such language in extreme times, but \u201cthe arrogation of it by the party of austerity makes me queasy\u201d. A hospital doctor in the Midlands said: \u201cOn an individual level, staff did behave \u2018heroically\u2019 in the sense that almost without exception they got on with the job and accepted the risks.\u201d But, he added: \u201cThe problem can be with the people who call the staff heroes. My neighbours who \u2018clap for carers\u2019 still held their VE Day party even when I begged them to be responsible and stay at home. So they weren\u2019t prepared to make any real effort but it makes them feel better to clap.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/25/nhs-surcharge-migrant-staff-government-campaign\">The NHS surcharge for migrant staff is gone.

As the Edinburgh GP says: \u201cPeople do the job because of a sense of vocation and professionalism \u2013 not out of some heroic sense of sacrifice \u2013 and they want to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/nhs-doctors-lacking-ppe-bullied-into-treating-covid-19-patients\">kept as safe as they possibly can</a>.\u201d</p> <p>A GP based in Yorkshire goes out of her front door at 8pm on a Thursday \u2013 but only, she told me, out of politeness.

A bit like the soldiers led by buffoons who were told to go over the top to be greeted by gunfire \u2013 except I am highly trained and should know better.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Charlotte Higgins is the Guardian\u2019s chief culture writer</p>",
  "<p>The horizon was a shifting channel of light. Cornfields grew between stands of cottonwood trees, and harvesters cruised down the double-yellow line spewing golden dust. Signs advertised gifts from Minnesota\u2019s northland: moccasins, wild rice, dreamcatchers, canoes. The radio station I\u2019d been listening to had played an entire Bruce Springsteen live concert: Rutherford, New Jersey, 1984.</p> <p>I was heading to the Northwest Angle \u2013 the northernmost point of the continental US \u2013 to research a book about the country\u2019s northern border. The Angle is a blip on the boundary \u2013 an isolated pocket in Minnesota set 100 miles north of the line of the main border. It is the northland of the northland \u2013 surrounded by Lake of the Woods on three sides and Canada on the other. To get there by road, you have to drive through Manitoba. </p> <p>It wasn\u2019t supposed to be that way. The Angle was a mistake, made at the time of the Treaty of Paris, the accord that ended the American Revolution in 1783. The map that the delegates used, made by a London physician-botanist and amateur mapmaker named John Mitchell, marked the source of the Mississippi, a key landmark on the proposed northern boundary, as 150 miles north of where it actually is.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3a59bcfdec4e5159e576010527c37d91b6a20e7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a59bcfdec4e5159e576010527c37d91b6a20e7d/0_0_1298_895/1000.jpg\" alt=\"northwest angle minnesota map\" width=\"1000\" height=\"690\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Negotiations continued nonetheless, and the line was drawn. When the Treaty of Paris was signed on 3 September 1783, US sovereignty was acknowledged by Britain; all British influence was abolished; British protection of American interests around the world was lifted; confiscated Loyalist property was to be reinstated; and the US\u2019s northern border was set from the north-west corner of Lake of the Woods to \u2026 nowhere.</p> <p>Five miles north of Warroad, Minnesota, I pulled up to the Canadian border. A stern, blue-eyed agent asked where I was going, if I\u2019d been there before and how I\u2019d heard about it. I said I was going to Angle Inlet, and he handed me a piece of paper that read, \u201cPhone Reporting from the Northwest Angle\u201d. A map at the top of the page showed the Angle\u2019s north\u2013south boundary. Three bubble quotes with telephone icons on them read Carlson\u2019s, Jim\u2019s Corner, and Young\u2019s Bay.</p> <p>I was to report in from Jim\u2019s Corner, he told me.</p> <p>I followed Route 12 \u2013 known as Mom\u2019s Way \u2013 through Manitoba to an abandoned gas station where the agent had said to take a right. I did and fishtailed onto a dirt road. Thirty minutes later, the road crossed back into US territory, and I spotted four older men huddled next to a phone booth at an intersection.</p> <p>\u201cIs this Jim\u2019s Corner?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>The men looked at me, then at each other. \u201cWe\u2019re wondering the same thing,\u201d one said.</p> <p>The group watched as I picked up the phone and pushed a button with an American-flag sticker on it. After a couple of rings a voice answered, \u201cUS Customs and Border Patrol.\u201d The agent ticked off a list of ambiguous and prying questions. \u201cWhat are you doing? Where are you going? Why are you going there? What kind of fish are you fishing for? Have you ever caught one of those before? How do you cook it? What does it taste like?\u201d Satisfied, the agent said I was checked in, and I left the old men, still huddled by the booth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"099f76569b0d1c16b983b919a91e65ad3ea23cd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/099f76569b0d1c16b983b919a91e65ad3ea23cd4/0_34_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"northwest angle lake\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lake of the Woods</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rutherford Studios/Sara Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Northwest Angle is 80% water. The other 20% is a rectangle of land that juts into Lake of the Woods. Angle Inlet, on the northern shore, is the only town. The population as of 2010 was 119. I drove past a few houses, a one-room schoolhouse, and a general store that opens daily from 4.30pm to 6.30pm. A hundred yards past the greens of a five-hole golf course, a sign pointed to a hotel called Jake\u2019s Northwest Angle. Another sign, on the office door, read: \u201cRing the pager (it works).\u201d I did and Jake\u2019s grandson, Paul Colson, drove up in a golf cart. He looked like a backwoods Chevy Chase \u2013 handsome, with short-cropped brown hair, a dimple on his chin, a smirk on his face. He was wearing sweatpants and a baseball hat and flipped the pager in his hand as we spoke.</p> <p>Paul\u2019s grandfather had pioneered the Angle and built three of the six cabins at the resort. The old man had also built the road I had driven in on and half of the town. Paul\u2019s boys grew up going to Angle Inlet School, the last one-room schoolhouse in Minnesota, until the sixth grade. After that they had to commute 65 miles to Warroad. Paul had spent the past 20 years fighting US and Canadian authorities who cut off access to hospitals and schools, unfairly taxed Angle residents and changed fishing and guiding regulations on Lake of the Woods, where most residents earn a living. The town has tried to secede from the US several times. The last effort was in the 1980s. The hassle of living in the Angle has kept families from moving there, and the community is slowly dying. \u201cYou gotta think how much longer we can keep doing this,\u201d Paul said.</p> <p>A deep inlet lined with tall reeds connects the resort to Lake of the Woods. A light breeze rustled the grass and cooled what was becoming an extraordinarily hot day for late September. We\u2019d been talking for 20 minutes before Paul asked if I wanted a room at the resort. I told him I\u2019d be there for a night, and he tossed me a key and nodded to a cabin behind the office. \u201cThe AC works,\u201d he said.</p> <p>I spent most of the afternoon reading about the Angle. After British explorer David Thompson discovered the actual headwaters of the Mississippi in 1798, it took nearly a century for US and British Boundary Commissions to survey it. It wouldn\u2019t be marked until 1912.</p> <p>Five years later, in 1917, Jake Colson and early settlers of the Angle arrived. Back then, the drums of the Ojibwe tribe reverberated through the forest. Jake found what he described as a Shangri-la overflowing with fish, game and wild rice, and a wilderness few non-native Americans had ever seen. He settled down with a cow, a few chickens and a garden. The Ojibwe called him Pohzhash, meaning \u201cbig Indian\u201d.<strong> </strong>He met his wife when his sister arrived for a visit with a friend. The couple lived in a tent until they finished their first cabin. They fished, logged and harvested marsh marigolds to survive. Jake worked as a hunting and fishing guide in the summer and saved money until 1945, when he built a few guest cabins.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"50beae66ada791dad04750cca31a4565d2788936\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50beae66ada791dad04750cca31a4565d2788936/0_34_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"northwest angle marker\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A marker by the water\u2019s edge</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sara Fox/Rutherford Studios</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Without a road to the Angle, business at his resort \u2013 accessed only by boat \u2013 was slow. Jake added an electric generator and running water. He helped build the town\u2019s post office and acted as its first postmaster. Then he got permission to build a connector road to Canada\u2019s Route 308, which runs north from Mom\u2019s Way. When fishermen left in the summer, duck hunters arrived; when the hunters left, ice fishermen came.</p> <p>CB radio was the only form of communication. Jake\u2019s black-and-white Zenith television could pick up one channel, from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. To deliver a baby or have a broken bone set, the family would drive 130 miles to Winnipeg. There was often a delay at the border as customs agents tried to figure out which country Angle Inlet was in. The telephone finally arrived in 1991.</p> <p>Paul knocked on my door the next morning to ask if I wanted to go fishing. Lake of the Woods is 1,700 square miles, and fishermen pay Paul $500 a day to make it a bit smaller. I grabbed my jacket and we walked to his boat. Paul\u2019s wife, Karen, came along. Paul, in camo hat and sweatshirt, sat sideways with his legs crossed, one hand on the wheel, the other tucked under his knee. He chatted with Karen about their kids\u2019 homework. Internet could be spotty in the Angle, and one of the boys had had trouble emailing a paper to his teacher. Karen held her phone over her head trying to get service and eventually managed to reach the teacher and get her kid off the hook.</p> <p>We passed Fort Saint Charles, a French Canadian fur-trading post built on an island in 1732. A trader named Pierre La V\u00e9rendrye had built the fort with his sons, before going on to explore and claim the western half of Canada for New France. The fort, reconstructed with new logs and asphalt shingles, sits on the US side of the line now, and an American flag flew behind the log palisade.</p> <p>There were no boundary markers on the lake as Paul crossed into Canada. We sailed past some long slabs of granite on the shores of Bukete Island and pulled into a bay whose location he made me swear not to reveal. He handed me a fishing rod, drove a hook through the head of a minnow, and tossed my line overboard. He did the same for Karen and himself, and they cast their lines off opposite sides of the boat. Ten minutes later we had eight fish packed in a cooler.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"072725801a7718b8ae0882a5f276aba38263ec5a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/072725801a7718b8ae0882a5f276aba38263ec5a/0_157_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"fish northwest angle\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Paul looked at his watch, and said we had to get back to meet the school bus. Back at the dock, Karen hopped off and headed home to meet the kids. Paul asked whether I wanted to join the family for fish tacos but I had a flight to catch in Minneapolis that night.</p> <p>He was already dropping fillets on the grill as I drove out. I headed west, past road signs riddled with bullet holes, while a few commuters drove by on their way home from Warroad. A wall of hardwood lined each side of the dirt road that Jake Colson had cut.</p> <p>The road had been graded recently and ran straight and smooth for 15 miles. I thought about the old man and his neighbours chopping their way through the dense forest. It must have taken thousands of man-hours, hauling brush and removing stumps. I figured Jake would be proud that his grandkids drove the road twice a day now, following the dusty finger from the Angle, through Canada back to the US.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.porterfox.com/\">Porter Fox</a></strong><strong> is author of Northland: A 4,000-mile Journey Along America\u2019s Forgotten Border (<a href=\"https://wwnorton.com/books/Northland/\">WW Norton</a></strong><strong>)</strong></p>",
  "<p>A fantasy preview screening of the BBC\u2019s powerful new drama Sitting in Limbo would have a handful of home secretaries lined up in the front row: Theresa May, Amber Rudd, Sajid Javid and Priti Patel \u2013 with David Cameron invited to sit alongside them. Further back, there would be places for the civil servants who devised immigration policy over the past decade, senior immigration enforcement officers and the governors of Britain\u2019s immigration detention centres.</p> <p>This memorable evening will, of course, never happen because of lockdown, and possibly also because this isn\u2019t how the BBC organises its screenings. But I hope that these politicians and officials force themselves to watch the one-off drama at home when it airs in early June. They may find it uncomfortable viewing.</p> <p>In 90 minutes, it tells the story of Anthony Bryan, 62, a builder who was mistakenly classified as an illegal immigrant by the Home Office in 2015, just as the government turned up the volume on its hostile environment policies, introduced to cut immigration numbers by making it very difficult for those without the correct documentation to continue living in Britain. Bryan was sacked from his job, twice arrested and twice sent to immigration removal centres, where he spent a total of five weeks, before being booked on a plane to Jamaica, a country he hasn\u2019t visited since he moved (entirely legally) to London as an eight-year-old in 1965.</p> <p>The drama, beautifully written by Bryan\u2019s younger brother, the novelist Stephen Thompson, captures the catastrophic consequences of getting placed on the Home Office list of suspected illegal immigrants.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"027f2f17e1b1637bada9e1ef79e1178cce11da41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/027f2f17e1b1637bada9e1ef79e1178cce11da41/209_68_5791_3475/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Patrick Robinson as Anthony Bryan in Sitting in Limbo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patrick Robinson as Anthony Bryan in Sitting in Limbo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Des Willie/BBC/Left Bank Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The casually sceptical language used by Home Office staff during their many interviews with Bryan is hard to listen to in the film. They repeatedly suggest he is lying when he sets out his life story. They refer to his children as his \u201calleged children\u201d, and the headteacher who has dug up a photo of him at primary school in the 1960s as \u201cthe man you claim is your ex-headmaster\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just doing my job,\u201d one of the officials tells him. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter that your job ruins people\u2019s lives?\u201d Bryan asks.</p> <p>I watched the film with a rising fury, and was immensely upset by it, which is surprising because I\u2019m already very familiar with the story. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/01/man-detained-threatened-with-removal-after-52-years-in-the-uk\">I met </a>Bryan and his partner, Janet McKay, in December 2017, days after he had been released from his second stint in immigration detention, when he was still fighting a deportation order. His son had contacted the Guardian after reading about another long-term UK resident, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/28/i-cant-eat-or-sleep-the-grandmother-threatened-with-deportation-after-50-years-in-britain\">Paulette Wilson</a>, who had also arrived in the UK from Jamaica as a child in the 1960s and who had also been sent to immigration detention and was trying to fight off deportation to a country she hadn\u2019t visited since she was 10.</p> <p>During a long interview, Bryan mentioned that he knew several other people who were being similarly harassed by the Home Office: friends from childhood who had also been misclassified as illegal immigrants, had been sacked from their jobs and were struggling to prove a mistake had been made. Over the next few weeks, he and McKay put me in touch with Hubert Howard, Tyrone McGibbon and Jeffrey Miller, all of whom had moved to the UK legally from Jamaica in the 1960s. Interviews with them and dozens of others triggered a government apology, Rudd\u2019s resignation and multiple promises to set things right.</p> <p>Two years on, things have not been resolved. The last figures published show that only 36 people affected have received compensation (totalling \u00a363,000 from a pot that officials expected to pay out between \u00a3200m and \u00a3500m). Bryan is still waiting.</p> <p>The actor Patrick Robinson, who plays Bryan, says he was in tears as he read the script. \u201cI knew this was happening to lots of people,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to be involved with the film in any shape or form.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The arguments our parents had in the 1950s and 1960s \u2026 I never thought we would be fighting them again</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Robinson had a friend, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/19/windrush-generation-tell-of-holidays-that-led-to-exile-and-heartbreak\">Junior Green</a>, who was refused re-entry into Britain after visiting Jamaica, despite having lived in the UK for 60 years, since arriving as a five-month-old. Green missed his mother\u2019s funeral while he was stuck in Jamaica for five months, trying to persuade officials that he was British and should be allowed to travel home.</p> <p>\u201cI was aware of it before it hit the news. The whole West Indian community was just collateral damage in the debate on immigration. The government\u2019s apologies are like putting a little piece of sticking plaster on a great big, gaping, festering wound,\u201d he says. </p> <p>His portrayal of Bryan\u2019s shifting emotions, from bemusement to desperation to silently mounting rage, is extremely moving. Robinson says his performance was fuelled by his anger at a scandal that could easily have touched his own family. His parents came from Jamaica in the 1960s; his four older siblings were born in Jamaica, while he and two younger children were born in the UK, where his father tried to continue his career as an electrician, but later accepted work as a bus driver. \u201cHe kept getting laid off.\u201d Was it racism? \u201cProbably. He wouldn\u2019t speak much about it. The history of people coming to the so-called motherland, and the history of double-standards that followed, is very close to me.\u201d</p> <p>Bryan is worried that most people have already forgotten the Windrush scandal, which is why he is so pleased that the film has been made. \u201cPeople find it hard to believe that this happened. They can\u2019t believe that I went through all that after 50 years here.

He wants to emphasise that his is just one story that illustrates what thousands have been through, and hopes that the film will push the issue back on to the political agenda. \u201cI\u2019d like immigration people to watch this to see what they put so many people through \u2013 people who shouldn\u2019t be locked up in the first place.\u201d</p> <p>The film opens with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/10/immigration-bill-theresa-may-hostile-environment\">clip of Theresa May</a>, when she was home secretary, standing behind a podium marked with the slogan \u201cFor Hardworking People\u201d, announcing in an eminently reasonable tone: \u201cThe government will soon publish the immigration bill which will make it easier to get rid of people with no right to be here.\u201d<strong> </strong>We see the then prime minister, David Cameron, remarking: \u201cWe would like to see net immigration in the tens of thousands rather than the hundreds of thousands.\u201d And we hear him self-righteously declaring: \u201cYou put into Britain, you don\u2019t just take out.\u201d</p> <p>Bryan and Thompson\u2019s mother, Lucille, who put a lot into the UK during her time working as a cleaner in an east London hospital, appears on screen shortly afterwards. She struggles to understand why her son has been arrested. Bryan says: \u201cMy mum used to say: \u2018Why are the police arresting you? You must have done something wrong.\u2019\u201d For a while, when everyone was questioning his story, he began to doubt his own memories.</p> <p>\u201cIt made me angry again watching it,\u201d McKay (who is played by Nadine Marshall) says. \u201cI think it will make people get up in arms against the Home Office and the system when they see the injustice.\u201d</p> <p>Thompson recalls his horror when McKay called him in 2016 to tell him that his older brother had been arrested. \u201cI thought there must have been a mistake; I couldn\u2019t get my head around the idea of deportation. It had seemed to be a case of mistaken identity, and felt like a vague, nonserious threat \u2013 until Janet made it quite clear that he would be deported.\u201d He watched what Bryan was going through, as the whole family rallied to try to get him out of detention.</p> <p>He has reassessed his sense of how far Britain has moved on from the racism endured by his parents\u2019 generation on arrival from the Caribbean. \u201cThe arguments our parents had in the 1950s and 1960s \u2026 I never thought we would be fighting them again; I thought we had won those arguments.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, he spent days talking to Bryan, nudging him out of a stoical refusal to dwell on his mistreatment. \u201cHe was very forthcoming on the facts, but he had to be cajoled into opening up personally. It\u2019s not just about losing your job, can\u2019t pay your bills, can\u2019t claim benefits. There has been a real emotional cost, too, and as he has gone along, he has become more open about the effects of it.\u201d</p> <p>Thompson\u2019s film shows Bryan enduring all the exhausting humiliations of a system that is designed to grind people into submission: the interminable queueing at Home Office reporting centres, where officials won\u2019t listen to you, and \u2013 if they do \u2013 aren\u2019t inclined to believe what you say; the hours wasted on hold to call centres in search of officials who might help; the financial difficulties that follow from being sacked, and told you aren\u2019t eligible for benefits (despite having paid UK taxes for years); the embarrassment of having to rely on your children for food. It is a shattering portrait of a system that aims to wear its targets down until they begin to think the idea of self-deportation (back to a country they haven\u2019t been to for half a century) is possibly the most sensible way out.</p> <p>\u201cHe got a sense that, no matter what documentation he provided, it was not going to help,\u201d Thompson says. He worries that the long delay in paying compensation is beginning to take its toll on Bryan. \u201cMy brother is naturally the forgiving and accepting type; he doesn\u2019t do embittered. But the unfortunate reality is that the longer this goes on, and the longer the government drags its heels over the next stage, it will be hard for him to stay that way. There has been a slow, steady erosion of his desire to see the good in everything,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cHe is trying to be patient, but the truth is that they are in very, very bad straits financially. He feels let down.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8c5b926b725630bd7bdbe5c0f5e710645180b603\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c5b926b725630bd7bdbe5c0f5e710645180b603/216_239_4058_2435/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anthony Bryan at home with his family in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anthony Bryan at home with his family in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve been talking to McKay and Bryan periodically for two and a half years (and for a few startling seconds towards the end of the film, I\u2019m figuratively on screen with them, played by Anna Madeley, somehow made to look disconcertingly like me).

It was the same hostile environment priorities that prompted the government in 2015 to introduce the NHS surcharge (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/johnson-forced-to-drop-nhs-surcharge-for-migrant-health-workers\">which was partly withdrawn last week</a> amid anger at the number of international healthcare staff forced to pay to access the NHS services they were working to provide and already paying taxes to fund).

The BBC might need to book a larger venue to have room for the 12,000 people who have been granted documentation by the Windrush Taskforce over the past two years, proving that they are not (and never were) illegal immigrants. Invitations should go to people such as Trevor Johnson, who was forced to beg on the streets of south London to feed his children, after officials decided he was here illegally, and Joycelyn John, who was frightened by years of Home Office intimidation into accepting a \u201cvoluntary removal\u201d back to Grenada, a country she had left aged four, 53 years earlier. At the end of the screening, there would be time for politicians to discuss the film with them.

  "<p>The government\u2019s \u201csnapback\u201d strategy has finally snapped. Gone is the Keynesian language about the benefits of the largest stimulus package in Australian history, when jobkeeper was announced in March. Tuesday\u2019s National Press Club address by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, makes clear that his government has returned to austerity, victim blaming and cliches.</p> <p>Like a lost driver claiming to have deliberately taken the scenic route, Scott Morrison is desperate to make a fiscal virtue out of the Australian Tax Office\u2019s $60bn administrative error. Just last week, the Treasury secretary, Steven Kennedy, was assuring the Senate that the unprecedented size of the government\u2019s fiscal stimulus package was appropriate, given the unprecedented size of the recession we are headed into. But this week, after learning that jobkeeker was only providing half of the stimulus he had promised, Morrison is pretending that he never really wanted to spend the full $130bn on jobkeeper anyway.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/27/scott-morrison-refuses-to-guarantee-pay-and-conditions-under-industrial-relations-overhaul\">Scott Morrison refuses to guarantee pay and conditions under industrial relations overhaul</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The underspend on jobkeeper is based on two entirely unrelated errors, but Morrison is now banking on Treasury having made a third \u2013 even bigger \u2013 mistake. Let\u2019s look at them one by one.</p> <p>The first mistake was the original costing of jobkeeper by Treasury, which predicted more than six million workers would benefit from the payment. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/13/australian-business-cant-lead-us-out-of-this-recession-the-government-must-step-up\">As I\u2019ve said before,</a> the numbers never looked right. With less than 14 million people in the entire labour force, the decision to exempt most casuals and temporary visa holders from the jobkeeper scheme meant that Treasury was predicting nearly half the eligible workforce would have qualified for a wage subsidy. Given that no one was predicting more than two million job losses, this meant that only three things were possible:</p> <p>1. The recession was going to be far deeper than Treasury\u2019s 10% forecast.</p> <p>2. We were going to give an enormous amount of public money to companies that had no intention of standing down most of their staff.</p> <p>3. The program would be massively underspent.</p> <p>I put my money on it being number two, and a bit of three. My colleague, Jim Stanford at the Centre of Future Work, went for a lot of three and a bit of two. Treasury was way off.</p> <p>The next error was made by the ATO, and it is worse in many ways. Forecasting is hard at the best of times and February was not the best of times. But once the jobkeeper cash started to flow out of the government\u2019s bank accounts and into employers bank accounts, the forecasting stopped and the counting should have begun. Time will tell how it happened but, to be clear, the ATO\u2019s error was that it had no idea how much money it was actually spending. In an incredible coincidence or cock-up, the wrong number they came up with happened to be about the same as Treasury\u2019s flawed forecast.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The $60bn question is: does Treasury still think we are heading for the biggest recession in a century?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And now, Morrison is not just betting his credibility, but the livelihood of millions of Australians, on the belief that his Treasury has made a third error about the size of the recession Australia is heading for.</p> <p>Both the Treasury and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) have forecast that Australia\u2019s GDP will be 10% smaller by September than it was in December last year. To put that fall into context, the 1991 recession saw GDP fall by less than 1.5%. If recessions were a wave, then the one heading towards us now is expected to be seven times higher than the last one to hit us. If Treasury\u2019s forecast is a bit out and GDP \u201conly\u201d falls by 8% then the recession will \u201conly\u201d be five times worse than 1991.</p> <p>Last week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/21/australias-treasury-chief-says-government-should-worry-about-jobs-and-not-rising-debt-during-coronavirus-crisis\">Kennedy addressed the C</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/21/australias-treasury-chief-says-government-should-worry-about-jobs-and-not-rising-debt-during-coronavirus-crisis\">ovid-19 Senate committee</a><strong> </strong>and assured the parliament not only that jobkeeper was being delivered to more than six million people, but that the $130bn cost of jobkeeper was appropriate, given the size of the recession that Treasury is expecting.</p> <p>So the $60bn question is: does Treasury still think we are heading for the biggest recession in a century?</p> <p>It would be phenomenal news if Treasury and the RBA no longer thought that Australia\u2019s national income was about to fall by 10%. The 1.5% recession of 1991 ruined hundreds of thousands of lives, and while the unemployment rate took years to fall, the reality is a lot of retrenched workers wound up on the age pension before the labour market created another job for them. Avoiding the 10% recession forecast would be the best possible news.</p> <p>But despite fronting the press club for an hour on Tuesday, Morrison made no mention of any such great news from Treasury. On the contrary, after demonstrating that his government had <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/policy/economy/spend-the-60b-windfall-on-bigger-stimulus-20200525-p54w1n\">spectacularly failed</a> to roll out the promised fiscal stimulus, Morrison simply tried to shift responsibility for managing the economy away from his government and on to the shoulders of everyone else.</p> <p>Despite the fact that mass unemployment is caused by a lack of demand for products, Morrison announced that his plan was to focus on the skills of the unemployed. This trick is an oldie but a goodie. It allows politicians to sound like they are helping the unemployed, while actually planting the idea that it is the unemployed people\u2019s lack of skills \u2013 rather than the federal government\u2019s lack of stimulus spending \u2013 that is the cause of unemployment. Blaming the victim always works in Australia.</p> <p>Morrison also tried to shift responsibility for job creation on to the unions and employer groups on Tuesday. Having finally ditched the conservative virtue signalling union busting legislation, Morrison is now arguing that industrial relations reform is central to his \u201cjobmaker\u201d plan, but ultimately the responsibility of others to design. Well played, Scott, well played.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/25/morrison-says-support-measures-are-only-temporary-medication-for-sick-economy\">Morrison says support measures are only temporary 'medication' for sick economy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For two months, Morrison and the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, have wrapped a cloak of Keynesian language around their fiscally conservative worldview. While it never fit well, this language at least suggested they were listening to the economic advice of Treasury. But on Tuesday, that cloak was discarded.</p> <p>The government has flicked the switch back to austerity economics and victim blaming. The jobmaker plan wasn\u2019t a package of legislation or funding, it was a list of cliches, designed to shift the economic debate away from the government\u2019s own failure to go early, go hard or go households, and back to the old political attacks designed to go unions, go \u201cdole bludgers\u201d and go state premiers.</p> <p>If Treasury really did make a third mistake, and now believes the looming recession might not be so bad at all, then Morrison might have pivoted at the perfect time. But if that\u2019s the case, his decision to keep Treasury\u2019s good news to himself may be \u201cgood\u201d politics but it\u2019s terrible for investor confidence.</p> <p>If Treasury hasn\u2019t significantly changed its view about the size of the recession heading our way, the prime minister\u2019s decision to ignore macroeconomic advice and focus on his preferred microeconomic hobby horses will be devastating for him. And, more importantly, it will be for Australia as a whole.</p> <p>We will find out which one it is soon enough.</p> <p>\u2022 Richard Denniss is chief economist at independent thinktank The Australia Institute</p>",

Police spotted the 76-year-old head of state in the outside dining area of the Vienna restaurant shortly after midnight on Sunday.

The country\u2019s Federal Association for Sexual Services has issued a statement insisting sex workers are not \u201csuper spreaders\u201d of the virus and proposing a three-step programme to reopen brothels, sex clubs and tabledance bars. The umbrella group argues that in most such establishments the \u201cworking situation\u201d is one of one-on-one contacts and thus comparable to hair salons or massage parlors. A cross-party group of 16 Bundestag MPs had last week proposed a long-term shutdown of all forms of prostitution in the wake of the pandemic: \u201cProstitution has the effect of a virus super spreader\u201d, the group said in an open letter. \u201cSexual acts are generally non-negotiable with social distancing.\u201d </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-26T09:50:48.308Z\">at 10.50am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eccdd598f0864e579f17c31\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-26T09:13:13.418Z\">10.13am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Indonesia </strong>has today reported 415 new confirmed cases of Covid-19, and 27 deaths.

In the meantime, these are the main developments from the last few hours: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Confirmed cases worldwide near 5.5m. </strong>According to the Johns Hopkins University coronavirus tracker, infections worldwide number at least 5,495,061. The death toll stands at 346,232. True death tolls and cases are likely to be significantly higher due to differing definitions and testing rates, delays and suspected underreporting.</li> \n   <li><strong>WHO warns of \u2018second peak\u2019 in areas where Covid-19 is declining. </strong>Countries where coronavirus infections are declining could still face an \u201cimmediate second peak\u201d if they let up too soon on measures to contain the outbreak, the World Health Organization said on Monday. The WHO emergencies chief, Dr Mike Ryan, told an online briefing: \u201cWe cannot make assumptions that just because the disease is on the way down now it is going to keep going down and we are get a number of months to get ready for a second wave. We may get a second peak in this wave.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>Mexico City records thousands more deaths than usual, amid doubt over official Covid-19 toll. </strong>This year, Mexico City has issued <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/mexico-city-records-thousands-more-deaths-than-usual-amid-doubt-over-official-covid-19-toll\">8,072 more death certificates than the average</a> for the same period in the past four years, according to a study that suggests the country\u2019s coronavirus death toll could be significantly higher than the official figure of nearly 7,400. The report\u2019s authors found 37% more death certificates were issued in April 2020 than that month\u2019s average during the previous four years. By the end of May they estimated the number may grow to 120%.</li> \n   <li><strong>White House brings forward Brazil travel restrictions by two days. </strong>The US has amended the timing of its Brazil travel ban to come into force at 11.59pm Washington time on Tuesday. It came as Brazil recorded a daily death toll higher than the US for the first time (807 versus 620). Brazil has the world\u2019s second highest number of infections. In its original announcement, the White House said the travel restrictions would come into force on 28 May.</li> \n   <li><strong>Dutch PM Mark Rutte did not visit dying mother due to Covid-19 restrictions. </strong>The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, was unable to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/dutch-pm-mark-rutte-did-not-visit-dying-mother-due-to-covid-19-restrictions\">visit his dying mother</a> in her final weeks because he obeyed coronavirus restrictions against visiting care homes, his office has said.

Bans on domestic travel, holding prayers in mosques, and workplace attendance in both the government and private sector will be lifted, starting 31 May, the statement added. For Mecca, the curfew time will be adjusted to 3pm-6pm and prayers will be allowed to be held in mosques from 21 June.</li> \n   <li><strong>Iceland eases national alert. </strong>Iceland eased its national alert against the coronavirus on Monday, allowing for public gatherings of up to 200 people and night clubs and gyms to reopen as the country nears complete recovery from the outbreak. Iceland, which limited the virus spread through a meticulous test-and-trace strategy and a full lockdown, has confirmed 1,804 infections and 10 deaths. But there have been only five reported new cases in May, and more than 99% of infected persons have recovered.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/coronavirus-latest-at-a-glance-26-may\">Coronavirus latest: at a glance</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-26T06:22:11.474Z\">at 7.22am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecca31d8f0864e579f17a87\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-26T05:56:05.986Z\">6.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Global report: 'disaster' looms for millions of children as WHO warns of second peak</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The coronavirus pandemic will have a \u201cdisastrous\u201d impact on children\u2019s rights worldwide, making them more vulnerable to forced labour and underage marriage, a rights group has said, as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">World Health Organization</a> warned of an \u201cimmediate second peak\u201d in cases if restrictions were lifted too soon.</p> \n  <p>Millions of children would fall into extreme poverty because of the outbreak, which has left governments short of money for health and education for the young, Dutch NGO KidsRights said.</p> \n  <p>The NGO\u2019s warning came as the WHO emergencies head, Dr Mike Ryan, spoke of a potential second wave of infections at any time, especially if measures to halt the first wave were lifted too soon.</p> \n  <p>He said: \u201cWe cannot make assumptions that just because the disease is on the way down now it is going to keep going down and we are get a number of months to get ready for a second wave.
