  "<p>The NSW government may use a military-style operation to test all cruise ship crew members currently off the coast of Sydney and Wollongong in an attempt to end a maritime standoff involving multiple ships which were ordered to leave Australian waters by police.</p> <p>\u201cYou could imagine, you know, dropping doctors, specialists across eight ships, 9,000 people, you know, it\u2019s a big task in itself,\u201d NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said.</p> <p>\u201cAnyone who requires urgent medical attention, we bring off and put into our hospital system.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/mar/26/the-choice-for-300-australians-stay-on-cruise-ship-with-covid-19-positive-passenger-or-disembark-in-italy\">The choice for 300 Australians: stay on cruise ship with possible Covid-19 cases or disembark in Italy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fuller said he feared the NSW health system did not have the capacity to bring all 9,000 crew onto land, especially as many of the cruise ships have seen Covid-19 outbreaks.</p> <p>\u201cMy fear is, by bringing 9,000 people off the cruise ships into isolation, not knowing if they have the virus or they may develop symptoms, that would absolutely overload our hospital system and everything that we have done to this point would be for nothing.\u201d</p> <p>Little is known about the state of health of the crew members on more than a dozen large cruise ships just off Australia\u2019s coast. Most have a crew of more than 1,000 who often live in close quarters below decks.</p> <p>At least a dozen people have already been brought to shore off these ships requiring urgent medical attention.</p> <p>The NSW government hopes that after this medical work is done, these vessels will return to their ports of origin.</p> <p>\u201cA ship left two nights ago, and there\u2019s information that over the next couple of nights another couple of ships will refuel and restock and go back to their original port, or their port of origin. So, we are chipping away,\u201d Fuller said.</p> <p>The International Transport Workers\u2019 Federation wants the Australian government to allow the thousands of crew members on the ships to be disembarked and flown home to their countries of residence amid fears the vessels will become humanitarian disasters if coronavirus takes hold aboard.</p> <p>In the case of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/31/more-than-400-coronavirus-cases-australia-total-ruby-princess-cruise-ship\">Ruby Princess</a>, which was sitting off Botany Bay, six crew had already had to be medically evacuated.

The Carnival Spirit (930 crew) was off the coast of Brisbane, while the Sea Princess (910 crew), Azamara Journey (408 crew) and Pacific Dawn were all floating off the Sunshine Coast. The Queen Elizabeth cruise ship, with 1,005 crew, was docked in Gladstone.</p> <p>In Western Australia, the Artania cruise ship and its 450 crew refused to leave on Wednesday, after 29 Australian passengers on board tested positive for Covid-19 and were taken to hospital.</p> <p>The state\u2019s premier, Mark McGowan, said he believed \u201cthe federal government needs to step up here \u2026 I just urge [them] to resolve the situation as soon as possible\u201d.</p> <p>The world\u2019s largest private residential ship, The World, was off the coast of Fremantle with 280 crew. The Golden Princess (1,100 crew) and Viking Orion were docked in Melbourne, and the Pacific Aria (602 crew) was docked in Adelaide.</p> <p>Most of the ships were sailing under flags of convenience from Caribbean countries, but Summers said this was done to avail the cruise lines of tax havens and to avoid first world employment conditions and wages.</p> <p>He said if the cruise ships returned to the ports they were flagged to, they would not even have berths for them.</p> <p>In what is developing into a legal quagmire, the NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, ordered the six ships off the coast of NSW to return to their port of origin, but they remained offshore.</p> <p>The NSW Port Authority has been permitting cruise ships to refuel and take on food, and the Radiance of the Seas and Carnival Sprit departed Port Kembla this morning. </p> <p>The maritime law expert John Kavanagh from Pacific Maritime said Australia had an economic zone stretching 200 miles offshore; and a 12 mile zone that is considered to be part of the nation. In between was the contiguous zone between 12 and 24 miles which allowed coastal nations to police bad behaviour such as drug smuggling and pollution.</p> <p>But Kavanagh said there was also an exception of \u201cinnocent passage\u201d, which allowed ships \u201cas of right\u201d to navigate through these zones.</p> <p>He said there were also obligations on Australia under international treaties, adopted by the Navigation Act, which imposed a duty to render assistance to ships in distress.</p> <p>Summers said a declaration of distress would trigger obligations for Australian governments, although he noted that when the MV Tampa, having picked up 433 asylum seekers from waters off the north-west coast of Australia sought the right to bring them to Australian waters, the Howard government refused.</p> <p>\u201cWe rescue millionaire yachtsmen at great cost, so we should honour our obligations,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A number of the cruise ships currently offshore claim Australian ports as their \u2018home ports\u2019 and operate in the Pacific, but they pay no Australian tax and employ few Australians.</p> <p>\u201cThe concept of \u2018home port\u2019 is simply an arcane rule and doesn\u2019t mean anything. It\u2019s the flag which determines what law applies,\u201d Kavanagh said.</p> <p>In a bid to avoid a repeat of the the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/anatomy-of-a-coronavirus-disaster-how-2700-people-were-let-off-the-ruby-princess-cruise-ship-by-mistake\">Ruby Princess fiasco</a> of two weeks ago, the federal and state governments set up a task force, with the department of foreign affairs and the NSW police commissioner as the decision makers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/31/australian-airlines-ask-government-for-up-to-56bn-to-survive-the-coronavirus-crisis\">Australian airlines ask government for up to $5.6bn to survive the coronavirus crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On 28 March, the NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, signed an order that means no one can leave these cruise ships, including Australian citizens, without the permission of the police commissioner.</p> <p>\u201cAllowances will be made to allow ships to reprovision, and cargo ships can continue to dock but no one can leave them without the police commissioner\u2019s express permission,\u201d a spokesman for the NSW police said.</p> <p>Earlier in the week, the commissioner said: \u201cThey don\u2019t pay taxes in Australia, they don\u2019t park their boats in Australia, their primary flags are often in the Caribbean in different islands.

Despite government guidance calling on landlords to \u201cshow compassion\u201d for their tenants, campaigners say the current policy is likely to lead to a major eviction and rent arrears crisis once the lockdown ends.</p> \n  <p>In a letter to the department for communities, homes and local government, the London Renters Union, which represents thousands of renters in London, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Urging landlords to \u2018show compassion\u2019 does nothing in reality to protect renters. The government has left renters to fend for themselves. As the government\u2019s recent <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/876500/Consolidated_Landlord_and_Tenant_Guidance_COVID_and_the_PRS_v4.2.pdf\">guidance</a> clearly states, tenants are still legally obliged to pay rent and landlords are still able to issue eviction notices to renters who enter into rent debt. The eviction process will begin as soon as the temporary ban on evictions is lifted.</p> \n   <p>Renters should be freed from having to make any rent payments during the coronavirus pandemic and should be protected from having to pay back massive arrears once social distancing measures are reversed.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The call was echoed by Acorn, a community-based union that organises among renters in 15 other cities. Kat Wright, Acorn\u2019s national organiser, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Despite the spin, the government is not protecting renters. When tenants are enduring much reduced incomes and are struggling to pay for basic necessities, it\u2019s unacceptable that landlords have their businesses protected at our expense.</p> \n   <p>Acorn is calling for a rent waiver for the duration of the crisis. In the midst of the worst public health emergency in living memory, a safe, secure home is not just an individual right but a public health necessity. We believe that housing is healthcare.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Research carried out late last month by Opinium, on behalf of the campaign group Compassion in Politics, found more than a third of workers said they had taken a financial hit due to emergency measures.</p> \n  <p>Of those, 14% said they had missed rent or bill payments. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e84c3e28f0866297e9f52b4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-01T16:42:53.668Z\">5.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>BuzzFeed\u2019s Emily Ashton asked about the \u201ccrisis within a crisis\u201d of the lack of PPE for frontline staff.</p> \n  <p>Sharma said over 390m PPE products had been delivered over the last two weeks and a 24-hour NHS hotline that staff could call to request PPE if needed. </p> \n  <p>Doyle added the intention was to ensure deliveries rapidly reached where they were needed most.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e84c2938f087564da1e3efc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-01T16:37:32.538Z\">5.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">'Testing intended to be increased for general population' \u2013 Doyle</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The FT\u2019s Laura Hughes asked about the government\u2019s exit strategy for getting us out of the lockdown and the role testing will play in that.</p> \n  <p>Sharma said the restrictions were for an initial three-week period then would be reviewed, but we could not allow efforts to be wasted and head to a dangerous second peak.</p> \n  <p>Doyle added that the prime minister would review the situation after Easter, based on scientific information and clinical evidence as to how the epidemic is progressing.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We want to make the right call at the right time on this.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Doyle appeared to confirm that the UK\u2019s strategy will be to increase testing for the virus in the general population, after days of calls from public health experts and the Tory former health secretary Jeremy Hunt to expand it out from hospital patients and the NHS. </p> \n  <p>This appears to contradict the approach outlined on Tuesday by Dr Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer, who said the future antibody testing to determine immunity was the key.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-01T16:46:48.745Z\">at 5.46pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e84c1a18f087564da1e3eed\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-01T16:34:22.169Z\">5.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Evening Standard\u2019s Joe Murphy asked whether people were getting complacent about the measures in place and why Germany\u2019s capacity to test was so much higher than the UK\u2019s.</p> \n  <p>Doyle said staff in contact with the sickest patients would be tested first.</p> \n  <p>She added that the reagents that worked best were those that worked best with the machines they were intended for.

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/uk-police-reissued-with-guidance-on-enforcing-coronavirus-lockdown\">Coronavirus Act 2020 </a>has given a ratchet to three of the most persistently controversial themes in British policing history: police powers, police discretion and police coordination. All three are back in the spotlight in the Covid-19 lockdown. But this week\u2019s arguments, prompted in part by the former supreme court judge <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2020/03/30/police-criticised-stepping-mark-lockdown-sanctions-12479549/\">Jonathan Sumption\u2019s</a> warnings about the growth of a police state, are only the start. The real test for the policing of the pandemic is yet to come.</p> <p>Ever since the creation of London\u2019s Metropolitan police in 1829, issues like these have been recurrent in the often volatile evolution of relations between politics, the police and the people. When the state took wide new powers last month they again became a source of argument. Police chiefs have not always appeared in control of events at a time when government is itself struggling to coordinate public discipline over travel, exercise and shopping.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/uk-police-use-drones-and-roadblocks-to-enforce-lockdown\">Coronavirus Act</a> is in some ways a recognisable descendent of the draconian emergency legislation that Britain adopted at the start of the world wars of the 20th century. But in some ways it is different. By and large, the wartime emergency legislation granted wide new powers to central government, which was then free to make regulations to apply them. But the 2020 act also gives many powers to the devolved authorities and confers other powers directly on public health, immigration and police officers at local level. As a result, a degree of potential inconsistency between nations, localities and even individual services was baked into the legislation at the start. Devolvers will approve. Centralisers will not. Much remains in need of sensible clarification.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Today\u2019s events are reminding a new generation of police that relations with the public are always contingent</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/uk-police-reissued-with-guidance-on-enforcing-coronavirus-lockdown\">different approaches</a> so far are often arbitrary. Derbyshire police have used drones to highlight people walking in the Peak District and dye to deter swimmers from a quarry pool near Buxton. This attracted the wrath of Lord Sumption, who called the policing disgraceful. But other forces are also doing things that, in other circumstances, would be highly controversial too. North Yorkshire are using soldiers to conduct roadblocks. Cumbria issued a unilateral decree that the Lake District was \u201cclosed\u201d. Devon and Cornwall police asked the public to report \u201cillegal gatherings\u201d. The Metropolitan police are challenging users of the London Underground to justify their journeys. Some of these acts can reasonably be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/30/uk-police-guidelines-coronavirus-lockdown-enforcement-powers-following-criticism-lord-sumption\">justified</a>, but others are plainly excessive.</p> <p>Some of these interventions echo wartime restrictions. At some stage in the current outbreak there may well be a protest picket somewhere against, perhaps, a supermarket over food prices or a bank for not lending to small businesses or the self employed. The picket may comply with all the physical distancing guidance and be dignified and orderly. But it would probably elicit the same response as a protest reported by the civil rights campaigner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/feb/23/council-for-civil-liberties-letter-kidd\">Ronald Kidd</a> in his wartime book, British Liberty in Danger. In June 1940, police tried to ban a meeting in south London against high food prices because, the police said, \u201cit was undesirable that \u2018ill-feeling should be stirred up at a time of crisis\u2019\u201d. That meeting eventually took place. A protest today might run up against the same response and be banned.</p> <p>Today\u2019s events are reminding a new generation of police chiefs and officers that relations with the public are always contingent. For generations, police in this country have set great store by the notion that they police \u201cby consent\u201d rather than by imposition. They like to think it distinguishes them from an un-British \u201cgendarmerie\u201d, against whom the Chartists protested in the early days of the Met. But \u201cpolicing by consent\u201d is often used, by both police and their critics, in unrealistic and idealised ways. Margaret Thatcher, for example, once said the police need \u201csupport and not criticism\u201d. Approaches like that bear no relation to complex social realities, not least in emergencies.</p> <p>Policing is a public good, but it is simultaneously a confrontational activity. It is a mistake to dismiss all policing as authoritarian. But nor is it the case that policing is just another public service. Consent, whether to policing or anything else, is always conditional. Consent has to be won and given, negotiated and sustained. Consent routinely involves invoking and accepting some degree of power. What is consent for some may be imposition for others. That goes with the territory. </p> <p>Consent may be problematic, but it is nevertheless crucial. Today\u2019s police chiefs properly invoke policing by consent. Greater Manchester\u2019s chief constable Ian Hopkins, in his public statement this week said, rightly, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/31/derbyshire-police-chief-defends-forces-reaction-to-lockdown\">mistakes had been made</a> in policing the lockdown and that some officers would get things wrong. The Met\u2019s assistant commissioner Neil Basu did the same thing when he wrote that policing by consent remained the mantra even in \u201ca period of readjustment to our new responsibilities\u201d.</p> <p>No one should be surprised that the appropriateness of various forms of policing has come to a head again in a time of pandemic. The state, after all, has just claimed unusual powers to direct our lives for the common and individual good. Those powers need to be debated \u2013 which parliament did not do \u2013 before they receive consent. The entire episode embodies what the philosopher Benedict de Spinoza wrote in 1670. \u201cIt is not, I contend, the purpose of the state to turn rational beings into beasts or automata, but rather to allow their minds and bodies to develop in their own ways in security and enjoy the free use of reason \u2026. Therefore, the true purpose of the state is in fact freedom.\u201d</p> <p>These early days of the policing of the pandemic are nevertheless relatively straightforward. Public consent is currently high. Most of us probably think that it is irresponsible to test the law to the limits by, say, heading off in the car to climb Snowdon.</p> <p>The much more difficult and demanding test will come in a few weeks, when someone in authority says that we have probably reached a stage where some of the restrictions can be lessened and aspects of the old normality resumed. That will be the point when Spinoza\u2019s \u201cfree use of reason\u201d will pose a far larger threat to the state\u2019s coronavirus policy. That will be the moment when the policing of what is normal and abnormal, responsible and irresponsible, good freedom and bad freedom will become more complex, chaotic and confrontational. It could be a long hot summer. We all need to start thinking about it now.</p> <p>\u2022 Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>Police in Uganda have charged 20 LGBT people with disobeying rules on physical distancing and risking the spread of coronavirus, in what campaigners say is a clear case of authorities in parts of Africa abusing newly imposed restrictions to target sexual minorities.</p> <p>Fourteen gay men, two bisexual men and four transgender women were taken into custody on Sunday when police raided a shelter on the outskirts of Uganda\u2019s capital, Kampala.</p> <p>A police spokesperson, Patrick Onyango, said the detainees had been disobeying distancing rules by \u201ccongesting in a school-like dormitory setting within a small house\u201d despite a ban at the time on gatherings of more than 10 people, since reduced to five.</p> <p>Onyango denied allegations made by LGBT campaigners that they were targeted because of their sexual orientation. \u201cWe still have offences of unnatural sex in our law books,\u201d Onyango <a href=\"https://news.trust.org/item/20200331154246-ffh8z/\">told Reuters</a>. \u201cWe would charge them with that law, but we are charging them with those counts, as you can see.\u201d</p> <p>Frank Mugisha, the executive director of Sexual Minorities Uganda, said the arrests were \u201ca clear case of discrimination\u201d against the LGBT community.

  "<p>Think of Antarctica and it is probably sweeping expanses of ice, and the odd penguin, that come to mind. But at the time of the dinosaurs the continent was covered in swampy rainforest.</p> <p>Now experts say they have found the most southerly evidence yet of this environment in plant material extracted from beneath the seafloor in west Antarctica.</p> <p>The Cretaceous, 145m to 66m years ago, was a warm period during which Earth had a greenhouse climate and vegetation grew in Antarctica.</p> <p>Scientists say the new discovery not only reveals that swampy rainforests were thriving near the south pole about 90m years ago but that temperatures were higher than expected. Such conditions, they add, could only have been produced if carbon dioxide levels were far higher than previously thought and there were no glaciers in the region.</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t know that this Cretaceous greenhouse climate was that extreme,\u201d said Dr Johann Klages of the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany and a co-author of the research. \u201cIt shows us what carbon dioxide is able to do.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc8cdf159f76011fb83a3f378ae49dd54e74fd4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc8cdf159f76011fb83a3f378ae49dd54e74fd4a/0_0_2592_1555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The seafloor drilling rig at work by the edge of the Pine Island glacier.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The seafloor drilling rig at work by the edge of the Pine Island glacier.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karsten Gohl/Alfred Wegener Institute</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2148-5\">Writing in the journal Nature</a>, the team explained how, in 2017, they drilled a narrow hole down into the seafloor near the Pine Island glacier in west Antarctica. This location is about 2,000km (1,200 miles) from today\u2019s south pole, but about 90m years ago it was about 900km from the pole.</p> <p>The hole was drilled and material extracted using a remotely operated rig. \u201cIt is like a spaceship sitting on the seafloor,\u201d said Klages.</p> <p>The first few metres of material were glacial sediment, dating to about 25,000 years ago, while the next 25m were sandstone, dating to about 45m years ago \u2013 something Klages said was of little interest to the team.</p> <p>As they worked, a huge field of sea ice was approaching. \u201cIt was getting a little dangerous,\u201d said Klages. \u201cWe said: \u2018OK, three more metres and then we can evacuate the coring site here.\u2019 And in this three metres we had this exciting new material.\u201d</p> <p>This three-metre section was composed of mudstone, topped by a coal-like material, and packed with soil from the ancient forest, complete with roots, spores and pollen \u2013 with the latter identified as coming from plants including conifer trees and ferns.</p> <p>\u201cIt is like if you would go to a forest near your house somewhere and drill a hole into the forest soil,\u201d said Klages. \u201cIt is really pristine \u2026 it was amazing.\u201d</p> <p>The team found evidence of more than 65 different kinds of plants within the material, revealing that the landscape near the south pole would have been covered in a swampy conifer rainforest similar to that found today in the north-western part of the South Island of New Zealand. The material was dated to between 92m and 83m years ago.</p> <p>It would have had average annual temperatures of 12-13C (53-55F), \u201cwhich is warmer than in Germany today\u201d, Klages said, adding that analysis of chemicals left by photosynthetic organisms called cyanobacteria revealed that surface waters, for example of lakes, would have been a pleasant 20C.</p> <p>Crucially, said Kages, computer modelling shows that such an environment so close to the south pole \u2013 where in the winter there is darkness for four months \u2013 would only have been possible if greenhouse gas concentrations were far higher than previously thought and the land surface were covered in vegetation.</p> <p>In other words there were no ice sheets present \u2013 something Klages noted had been a matter of debate.</p> <p>Dr James Bendle, an expert in organic geochemistry from the University of Birmingham, said that studying the Antarctic ecosystem was hugely important in understanding past and future climate change, adding that unabated use of fossil fuels use could push concentrations of carbon dioxide to levels similar to those 90m years ago by the start of the next century.</p> <p>\u201cUltimately, if we have an atmosphere of more than 1,000 parts per million of carbon dioxide, we are committing ourselves to a future planet that has little to no ice, and ultimately an Antarctic continent that would be vegetated and wouldn\u2019t have an ice cover,\u201d he said.</p>",
  "<p>The glory of the world\u2019s oceans could be restored within a generation, according to a major new scientific review. It reports rebounding sea life, from humpback whales off Australia to elephant seals in the US and green turtles in Japan.</p> <p>Through rampant overfishing, pollution and coastal destruction, humanity has inflicted severe damage on the oceans and its inhabitants for centuries. But conservation successes, while still isolated, demonstrate the remarkable resilience of the seas.</p> <p>The scientists say there is now the knowledge to create an ocean renaissance for wildlife by 2050 and with it bolster the services that the world\u2019s people rely on, from food to coastal protection to climate stability. The measures needed, including protecting large swathes of ocean, sustainable fishing and pollution controls, would cost billions of dollars a year, the scientists say, but would bring benefits 10 times as high.</p> <p>However, the escalating climate crisis must also be tackled to protect the oceans from acidification, loss of oxygen and the devastation of coral reefs. The good news, the scientists say, is a growing awareness of the ability of oceans and coastal habitats such as mangroves and salt marshes to rapidly soak up carbon dioxide and bolster shorelines against rising sea levels.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a narrow window of opportunity to deliver a healthy ocean to our grandchildren, and we have the knowledge and tools to do so,\u201d said Prof Carlos Duarte, of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia, who led the review. \u201cFailing to embrace this challenge, and in so doing condemning our grandchildren to a broken ocean unable to support good livelihoods is not an option.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Callum Roberts, at the University of York, one of the review\u2019s international team, said: \u201cOverfishing and climate change are tightening their grip, but there is hope in the science of restoration.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the overarching messages of the review is, if you stop killing sea life and protect it, then it does come back.

By declaring the area a war zone, the military also has more power to regulate traffic and search homes.</p> <p>Hoinathy said communities in this area have already suffered from the conflict, facing violence and harassment from armed groups while military operations had restricted a local economy based on fishing and livestock.</p> <p>Even before the current escalation, the US government\u2019s <a href=\"https://fews.net/west-africa/chad/food-security-outlook/february-2020\">famine </a><a href=\"https://fews.net/west-africa/chad/food-security-outlook/february-2020\">early </a><a href=\"https://fews.net/west-africa/chad/food-security-outlook/february-2020\">warning </a><a href=\"https://fews.net/west-africa/chad/food-security-outlook/february-2020\">system</a> cautioned that displaced people and host communities in Lak, the region covering Chad\u2019s part of the lake, would struggle to meet their food needs through to September.</p> <p>Chad\u2019s defence minister, Gen Mahamat Abali Salah, announced on television that the country had also sent troops to Nigeria and Niger to clear the islands on the lake.</p> <p>Jacob Zenn, a senior fellow at research group Jamestown Foundation, said the attack was a \u201cwake-up call\u201d that was likely to direct Chad\u2019s focus on the area, but he warned it might go too far.</p> <p>\u201cI think Chad will risk becoming too ambitious in attacking Iswap and Boko Haram. That would lead to a snowball effect of more attacks in Chad, and so I think it\u2019s just a sign of more violence in Chad to come,\u201d he said.</p> <p>More than 1,000 Chadian soldiers recently withdrew from Nigeria\u2019s Borno state after months of fighting Boko Haram there, but more are reportedly being sent to Burkina Faso and Mali to battle militants active across the Sahel.</p> <p>International powers have relied heavily on Chad\u2019s soldiers to tackle militants in the region but last week\u2019s death toll has raised concerns about whether the army, also fighting rebels opposed to D\u00e9by\u2019s rule, is too thinly stretched.</p> <p>Hoinathy said the attack had shocked people and raised questions about capacity. \u201cCan we just keep on deploying our army the way we are doing, on so many battlefronts?

Not for nothing was the company known by its Spanish name \u2013 La Nueve or La Espa\u00f1ola.</p> <p>One hundred and forty-six of the company\u2019s 160 men were Spanish and, despite serving in the French army and under a French commanding officer, they were permitted to stitch the red, yellow and purple flag of Spain\u2019s second republic on to their uniforms.</p> <p>They were also allowed to paint the flag on their vehicles, which rolled into Paris emblazoned with names such as Guernica and Don Quichotte (Don Quixote). Spanish was the common language within the company and all had fought during the liberation of French north Africa.</p> <p>The company, led by the Spanish Lt Amado Granell, was the first to enter Paris on 24 August 1944 through the Porte d\u2019Italie, in the south of the city. As they awaited the official surrender of the German governor of occupied Paris, Dietrich von Choltitz, La Nueve troops were sent to occupy public buildings and those taken over by the German military command, as well as Place de la Concorde.</p> <p>Granell entered City Hall at about 8.40pm local time and met with the head of the national council of the French resistance. Captain, later colonel, Raymond Dronne, the commander of La Nueve, wrote in his memoirs that he fell asleep in the early hours of the morning to the sound of Spanish songs.</p> <p>Allied troops led by Gen Charles de Gaulle entered Paris the following day. More than 50 members of La Nueve received the Croix de Guerre for bravery.</p> <p>In his victory speech a day later on 26 August 1944 , De Gaulle did not mention the Spanish soldiers.</p> <p>\u201cParis is outraged. Paris is destroyed. Paris is martyred. But Paris is liberated! Liberated by itself, liberated by its people with the help of the armies of France,\u201d he said.</p> <p>La Nueve\u2019s contribution to the city\u2019s liberation has only recently been recognised. The company was forgotten or left out of the French history books for political reasons \u2013 with the liberation presented as an exclusively French triumph. It was only in August 2004 \u2013 60 years later \u2013 that Paris officially paid homage to the division with a plaque.</p> <p>Granell died in 1972 in a road accident on his way to the French consulate in Valencia, Spain, where was going to claim his veteran\u2019s salary.</p> <p>\u201cThey liberated Paris, but not just Paris,\u201d the city\u2019s mayor, Anne Hidalgo, has said. \u201cThe liberation of this city was celebrated all over the world as a victory for freedom.

But bartenders like Wakelin, who is working on <a href=\"https://www.thestar.co.uk/lifestyle/food-and-drink/duo-behind-uks-best-bar-are-opening-new-restaurant-sheffield-2006305\">a new Sheffield bar, Bench</a>, relish such a creative challenge. He would combine three parts cura\u00e7ao, triple-sec or Cointreau with two parts leftover white wine and one part soda over ice. \u201cIf you have one, add an olive.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>St-Germain</strong></h2> <p>This elderflower liqueur lends itself to what <a href=\"https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2018/08/meet-yann-bouvignies-the-new-head-mixologist-at-scarfes-bar/\">Yann Bouvignies</a>, head bartender at the Rosewood hotel\u2019s Scarfe\u2019s Bar in London, describes as a \u201cwet martini\u201d with the \u201cfloral sweetness making it more approachable\u201d.

Take 15ml of any aniseed spirit (sambuca, raki, pastis), 35ml gin, 15ml lemon juice, 25ml blackcurrant cordial and top with 100ml of soda. \u201cI\u2019ve kept it light \u2013 feel free to adjust it to your tastes.\u201d</p> <h2>Cacha\u00e7a</h2> <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re sick of making <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alEN21hwRYI\">caipirinhas</a>, here\u2019s a Brazilian twist to your aperitif fizz,\u201d says Tudor: 25ml each of fermented sugar cane cacha\u00e7a, amaretto and lemon juice are mixed and topped with sparkling wine. \u201cThe wine\u2019s dryness cuts the cacha\u00e7a\u2019s sweetness.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b70d027be5bd9c275f3e0cbb0a247cdce9e3e8ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b70d027be5bd9c275f3e0cbb0a247cdce9e3e8ee/0_0_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"P\u00e1linka ... earl grey makes a refreshing iced tea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">P\u00e1linka ... earl grey makes a refreshing iced tea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: 5PH/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>P\u00e1linka</h2> <p>Bouvignies would utilise this Hungarian fruit brandy in something akin to a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV5qHdkitgw\">horse\u2019s neck</a> cocktail (50ml p\u00e1linka, two dashes of Angostura bitter, ginger ale). Meanwhile, Erik Lorincz, owner of London\u2019s Kw\u00e3nt bar, sets it to work in a sour. Take 60ml of preferably peach or pear p\u00e1linka, 30ml lemon juice, 15ml sugar syrup (two parts sugar to one part water), an optional half an egg white, shake everything over ice and serve. Venning takes a different approach, mixing p\u00e1linka with a squeeze of lemon or orange juice over ice and topping that with chilled, sweetened earl grey tea: \u201cA really refreshing iced tea as the weather warms up.\u201d</p> <h2>Cr\u00e8me de menthe</h2> <p>Wakelin swaps fresh mint for cr\u00e8me in his take on a <a href=\"https://www.ginfoundry.com/cocktail/southside-cocktail/\">southside cocktail</a>. Combine 45ml gin, 5ml cr\u00e8me, lime juice and a pinch of salt, then stir in sweetener: \u201cI\u2019m using one spoon of honey I\u2019ve had for ages. Sugar is fine.\u201d Add ice; top with tonic. At London\u2019s Darby\u2019s, bar manager Wes Yeung uses cr\u00e8me in Irish coffee. Whisk 10ml into double cream, brew 150ml of coffee, stir in a teaspoon of brown sugar and 35ml of whiskey. Then: \u201cOver the back of a spoon held against the glass just touching the coffee, float cream over the top.\u201d</p> <h2>Retsina</h2> <p>That pine-powered retsina you loved in Crete can taste like a slap in the chops back in Britain. Take the edge off it in a spritz. Add 25ml each of retsina and elderflower cordial, says the Goring hotel\u2019s Tiago Mira, a splash of soda and top with prosecco. Garnish with cucumber. For sweeter versions of retsina cocktails, Benoit Provost, manager at the Stafford London\u2019s American Bar, advises you use Greek mastika instead, a liqueur with a \u201cslightly pine, cedar-like flavour\u201d.</p> <h2>Amarula</h2> <p>This South African cream liqueur \u201cis a good alternative to Bailey\u2019s, if you like that sort of thing,\u201d says Provost, who, like Mira, uses it in a take on the espresso martini. Mira\u2019s recipe has 50ml of vodka, 25ml Amarula and a shot of espresso shaken over ice and served garnished with coffee beans.</p> <h2>Amari</h2> <p>This family of herbaceous, bitter Italian liqueurs, running from Campari to Fernet-Branca, is enjoying a moment in the UK. Often drunk neat, they are also the basis of Wakelin\u2019s version of a garibaldi, a simple drink of fresh orange aerated with a stick-blender until \u201cnice and fluffy\u201d, spiked with 50ml of your preferred amaro.</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>\u2018Picture this,\u201d someone says. \u201cA juicy green apple. Can you see it?\u201d</p> <p>Of course I can\u2019t see it. My head is filled with all things apple; the central concept connects with myriad associated topics: orchards, trees, red apples, rotting apples, cider, blossom, an endless web that spreads along more and more tenuous connections. But of course I can\u2019t see it. I usually say yes, though, because I assume it\u2019s a figure of speech.</p> <p>But 98% of people actually do see the thing they\u2019re imagining, like a picture in their head. The other 2%, like me, are aphantasic. There\u2019s a line I like in John Green\u2019s The Fault in Our Stars: \u201cI fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once.<em>\u201d</em> I found out I was aphantasic slowly, then all at once. Decades ago, my wife began visualisation for meditation. I couldn\u2019t do it. Not only could I not see an imaginary orange, I couldn\u2019t see a circle or the colour orange. But I understood visualisation to be a special skill that you worked on. Rather like juggling. And I was sure that with practice I could accomplish either one of those.</p> <p>Then a year ago, I read an article online about aphantasia and all at once I understood that pretty much everyone visualised their thoughts <em>all the time!</em></p> <p>That was a shock. I understood the concept. Like the large majority of aphantasics I see pictures when I dream. (Dreaming comes from a different part of the mind.) But it sounded like great fun to be able to summon moving images to the mind. I felt suddenly robbed, as if I had missed out on some universal treat. And that\u2019s how the language frames it \u2013 you \u201csuffer\u201d from aphantasia. A swift Googling gives us this description: \u201cAphantasia is neurological defect that affects the brain without any serious health risks.\u201d A defect. Well \u2026 damn.</p> <p>People I tell are amazed. They want to know how I even function, how I imagine anything. There\u2019s a distinct vibe of pity. I have a severely disabled daughter, so I in no way want to overplay this card \u2013 I know what disability is \u2013 but, in some sense, I felt momentarily that I was disabled, that I lacked a significant ability that I should have had.</p> <p>I\u2019ve discovered since that there are people who don\u2019t hear an inner voice. At this point I shared the incredulity others experience regarding aphantasia. It\u2019s hard for me to imagine life without an internal voice. I also discovered that some people have other internal senses, such being able to smell, touch and taste in their minds. I can\u2019t do those things either.</p> <p>I don\u2019t have a problem with imagination. I write books that are often praised for clear and evocative visual description. I\u2019m asked by people if I\u2019ve climbed rock faces, fought with swords or even had cancer, because my descriptions of these experiences have convinced people who have actually lived them that I must have, too. (I haven\u2019t.)</p> <p>It\u2019s very hard to know if aphantasia has an impact on my writing. I tend to avoid lengthy visual description, but I feel that\u2019s a matter of taste. I\u2019m currently going over a forthcoming book with my editor, who uses the \u201cpraise sandwich\u201d to feed criticism past the author\u2019s ego. So she takes the time to compliment lines she admires, such as this one:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Wings rose above the holothaur\u2019s back, a black suggestion of flight, reaching to the vaulted ceiling to merge with the shadows there.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Now this is a wraithlike creature, so harping on about veined leathery wings or midnight feathers or whatever wouldn\u2019t be appropriate. But I guess I do tend to stretch the language in a manner that brushes against poetry, such as in \u201ca black suggestion of flight\u201d, which focuses on a feeling, rather than specific physical details.</p> <p>These days, I reject the description of aphantasia as a defect. I see it as an alternative. You see a horse if asked to imagine one. I find this rather limiting. I imagine a web of horse-stuff that leads me down many paths. The idea of seeing one particular horse actually lacks appeal. What if it\u2019s not the horse I want? What if I want something larger, more fundamental than an image? From the outside all we see are results; the interior workings are hidden. The idea that the qualitative experience behind each individual\u2019s existence can be so different is a new and fascinating one. I suspect that we have much to learn about quite how unique each of us is in the handcrafted virtual reality we all maintain behind our eyes.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"http://www.marklawrence.buzz/book/\">Mark Lawrence</a> is the author of The Broken Empire series.

He introduces new measures and waits for the fuss to die down.\u201d</p> <p>Luuk van Middelaar, a professor of EU law who worked for the European council president during the eurozone crisis, believes the EU can improvise a way out of current divisions. \u201cThe EU is internally ill-equipped to deal with any crisis or unforeseen circumstances, and yet each time under the pressure of events it improvises solutions.\u201d</p> <p>During the eurozone crisis it took \u201ctwo years of drama and near-death experiences\u201d to fashion the solution of European banking union, \u201cas it always takes time for interests and minds to converge ... This time we don\u2019t have that much time so that is worrying.\u201d</p> <p>Tocci, director of Italy\u2019s Institute for International Affairs, thinks the EU can rescue the situation by moving the coronabonds debate on to more \u201ccool-headed, technical\u201d terrain. \u201cWho is actually going to emit these bonds \u2026 What are these bonds going to be for? And if one actually manages to give specific technical answers to these questions then it could be an opportunity to break the ice on a debate that has become so polarised.\u201d</p> <p>Letta envisages a \u201ccorona deal\u201d that avoids the divisive question of mutualised debt by having bonds issued by the European Investment Bank, the EU\u2019s lending arm. But Germany and the Netherlands also need to move, according to the Italian former prime minister. \u201cThe key point to the Germans and the Dutch: please don\u2019t block, don\u2019t stop European measures that we can take together.\u201d</p> <p>Any deal carries the seeds of a future argument. Every time the EU has strengthened its hand in response to a crisis, whether centralised refugee policy or oversight of national budgets, there has been resistance and resentment, according to Middelaar. \u201cThe Germans have still not fully digested the role of the European Central Bank as the lender of last resort,\u201d he said while mandatory refugee quotas deepened the cleavage between western and central European countries. \u201cIt\u2019s just worth remembering that Italy does not have a monopoly on Eurosceptic politicians. In Germany and the Netherlands there are also Eurosceptics waiting to exploit this issue.\u201d</p> <p>European leaders\u2019 response will ultimately shape public opinion. When Italians felt they had been left alone by Europe in the early phase of the pandemic, confidence in the European project shrank. A <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_whatever_it_takes_italy_and_covid_19_crisis\">poll conducted on 12-13 March</a> found that 88% of Italians felt Europe was failing to support Italy, while 67% saw EU membership as a disadvantage - a remarkable result for a founding member state, where the EU once basked in high levels of support.</p> <p>If European division prevails, the memory will stick of the time when China and Russia rushed to Italy\u2019s aid, thinks Tocci. Italian confidence in the EU \u201cdepends more on what Europe does than what the Chinese and Russia do\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI think that the jury is still out as to whether Europe is going to do what it takes to come out stronger from this.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The biggest occasion in the Islamic calendar, the annual <em>hajj</em> pilgrimage, has become the latest global event to be jeopardised by coronavirus, with Saudi authorities suggesting travellers delay plans to visit Mecca in late July.</p> \n<p>The comments have been widely interpreted as clearing the ground for a cancellation of this year\u2019s event, a rare occurrence in modern history: the last such closure took place more than 200 years ago.</p> \n<p>Mecca and Medina, the two holy cities that are hubs of the pilgrimage, have both been in effect closed to visitors for the past month, a step that was not taken during the 1918 flu pandemic. Saudi officials have sealed the country\u2019s borders to foreigners and imposed widespread restrictions on movement inside the kingdom, partly in the hope of eradicating the disease before the <em>hajj</em>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/emea\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>However, with the virus swirling around the world, modelling suggesting it could take many more months to be contained and global aviation having almost ground to a halt, there seems no viable scenario in which such a mass movement of pilgrims could be hosted in late July.</p> \n<p>Saudi Arabia has recorded about 1,500 cases of coronavirus and 10 deaths. There have been almost 72,000 cases in the Middle East, many of which have stemmed from the region\u2019s biggest outbreak, in the Iranian city of Qom.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe kingdom of Saudi Arabia is prepared to secure the safety of all Muslims and nationals,\u201d the Saudi <em>hajj</em> and <em>umrah</em> minister, Muhammad Saleh bin Taher Banten, told state television on Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have requested from all Muslims around the world to hold onto signing any agreements until we have a clear vision.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/coronavirus-mapped-which-countries-have-the-most-cases-and-deaths\">Coronavirus mapped: which countries have the most cases and deaths?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The <em>hajj</em>, the annual timing of which is dictated by the lunar calendar, is last thought to have been cancelled in 1798. It has not gone ahead on about 40 other occasions because of disease and conflict. The looming cancellation this year has led some observers to suggest an end-of-days prophecy was drawing near.</p> \n<p>\u201cSaudi authorities appear to be psychologically preparing people for the possibility that the <em>hajj</em> might have to be cancelled,\u201d said Shiraz Maher, a lecturer in war studies at King\u2019s College London. \u201cThey\u2019ve started pointing out historical instances from the past where the <em>hajj</em> had to be suspended for various reasons, including calamity and war. I think this is part of a broader attempt to reassure people that if it happens, it\u2019s not entirely unprecedented.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are prophecies that say one of the signs of the day of judgment is the abandonment of the <em>hajj</em>. Some are saying a cancellation due to coronavirus is a marker that the end of days is drawing nearer.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cOthers say the term \u2018abandonment\u2019 in this context means when people lose the desire to perform the <em>hajj</em>, which is not the case right now. So you have conflicting messages of despair and optimism, depending on how you interpret the prophecy.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Islamic faith requires all able Muslims to perform the ritual once in their lifetime. It is seen as a purifying period in a worshipper\u2019s life. Saudi Arabia draws much of its global legitimacy from protecting the two holy shrines and hosting the annual event, which draws up to 3 million pilgrims each year to the two sprawling sites in the south of the country.</p> \n<p>In addition to the possible cancellation, the Tokyo Olympics, also scheduled for July, have been delayed by 12 months and an axe is hanging over this year\u2019s Wimbledon tournament, which is set for late May. Formula One grands prix in Bahrain and Monaco have also been scrapped, while football competitions across Europe have been put on ice.</p>",
  "<p>Except for the photos of people who have recovered from Covid-19, flashing victory signs, some wearing the new accessory, oxygen cannulas, few encouraging images have emerged from the pandemic. We\u2019ve seen coffins in Bergamo, panicked migrant workers in New Delhi, patients on gurneys lining the hospital hallways in Spain and here at home.</p> <p>Among the most disturbing are the photos and videos of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/whatisny/status/1243550033200504833\">jam-packed New York subway stations and cars</a>, crowded with passengers \u2013 mostly people of color \u2013 on their way to work. Some passengers are wearing masks, some aren\u2019t. Whether they like their jobs, believe in what they do, worry about health protections at work, fear losing their health insurance, if they have any, they probably have something in common: they wouldn\u2019t be on this packed subway if they didn\u2019t have to be.</p> <p>They know how you get the virus, and they don\u2019t want it, but they need the money they make as supermarket clerks, janitors, nursing home aids, medical workers and first responders. It\u2019s foolish to think we can know the thoughts of others, but I\u2019d imagine that these people would rather be hunkered down with their families in light-filled country houses, e-ordering gourmet pantry items, letting the nannies home-school the kids, Instagramming dinner.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/31/california-rent-strike-coronavirus-eviction\">'This is about survival': California tenants plan rent strikes as Covid-19 relief falls short</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That families needed a disaster plan was something one heard after 9/11.

Bake bread and post it on Facebook.</p> <p>The working class has a very different plan, perhaps because the plan was made <em>for</em> them. Find someone to watch the kids. Ride the crowded train or bus. Worry when someone coughs at work, where there\u2019s not enough hand sanitizer. Do the same thing in reverse. Repeat. Maybe these are the lucky ones, compared with the ones who can easily self-quarantine because they have lost their small businesses and jobs and are worried about paying the rent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5162d10c593703508571c5b70191384726433d25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5162d10c593703508571c5b70191384726433d25/0_0_719_840/428.jpg\" alt=\"A screen grab of a video showing a crowded subway in New York, NY.\" width=\"428\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A screen grab of a video showing a crowded subway in New York, NY.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WhatIsNewYork/Twitter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Their stories are out there, but not as much as the statistics of the confirmed cases and the dead. The numbers have our attention, along with the political circus in Washington, and the latest major or minor celebrity who has been diagnosed. Occasionally the media will run the story of a person who isn\u2019t famous but who contracted the virus in an <em>interesting</em> way.</p> <p>Perhaps that jam-packed subway car isn\u2019t an interesting story. Perhaps the way that the working class is knowingly being fed to this virus isn\u2019t an interesting story. And besides, it makes us feel bad. We know the virus isn\u2019t our fault, but the fact that there are human beings, packed in during a plague, in a metal tube speeding underground, the fact that some warehouses, trucking firms and big box stores don\u2019t protect their workers, well, that sort of <em>is</em> our fault. We could have done something about it before we had to leave our offices and focus on survival. Before things got so complicated.</p> <p>Of course, we all have a lot to think about, at the moment. Ventilators, for one thing. Staying alive, for another. But when we come through this \u2013 as history and science suggest we will \u2013 we might take this chance to reflect on how the last 40 years of American politics have not only hardened our hearts but encouraged that hardening. We have seen ourselves transformed into Reality TV contestants on Survivor and The Apprentice, with their zero-sum games and rightwing Darwinian faith in the survival of the fittest. We have been taught that you don\u2019t have to care about anyone outside your family circle. To see any human commonality with those subway passengers is to be a weak little bleeding heart snowflake.</p> <p>In the aftermath of 9/11, newspapers ran whole sections commemorating the lives lost in the Twin Towers, on the planes and among the first responders, not only the CEOs but the receptionists and support workers who rode to work on the trains like the ones in the recent photos and videos. But now it\u2019s the cultural figures we read about, the scientists, politicians, educators, athletes, musicians, glamorous high achievers to whom this was not supposed to happen. For us to read about the woman who cuts our hair or works in our dentist\u2019s office, she\u2019d have to have been a guest at some spectacular super-spreading social event.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Let\u2019s look at those subway cars in the pandemic and try to imagine a society in which we realize that we are responsible for one another</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The story of this pandemic isn\u2019t over.

Let\u2019s look at those subway cars in the pandemic and try to imagine a society in which we realize that we are responsible for one another, that our lives depend on those passengers, that we owe it to them to make sure they can do what they do, for all of us, without worrying about healthcare, homelessness or being able to feed their kids. By the next pandemic, maybe we will have figured out how people can afford to get sick and feed their kids and get to work without risking their lives.</p>",

  "<p>Good evening, and welcome to our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Melissa Davey bringing you the main stories on Wednesday 1 April.</p> <h2>National death toll reaches 21</h2> <p>Western New South Wales local health district said a person admitted to Orange base hospital with Covid-19 died on Wednesday after suffering complications due to the virus.</p> <p>At the request of the family, a district spokeswoman said no further details would be provided. It takes the NSW death toll to 10 and the national toll to 21. Earlier on Wednesday, NSW Health announced that a 95-year-old woman who was a resident at the Dorothy Henderson lodge died overnight. The woman is the fifth person to die from coronavirus in the home. There are 4,860 cases in Australia.</p> <h2>Retired and non-practising health workers to be deployed</h2> <p>More than 40,000 doctors, nurses, midwives and pharmacists who are no longer practising or registered will be encouraged to re-enter the workforce to boost capacity to treat patients throughout the pandemic.</p> <p>The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency on Friday said a short-term pandemic response sub-register would be in effect for the next year. This will be a separate and temporary register to the <a href=\"https://www.ahpra.gov.au/Registration/Registers-of-Practitioners.aspx\">existing register of medical practitioners</a>.</p> <p>Only those who are properly qualified and competent will be invited to register, so practitioners who lost their registration due to malpractice will not be included. While it will be an opt-out register, no practitioner will be forced to practise and can remove themselves for any reason. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian Australia's coronavirus email signup button\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a></figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Victoria backtracks on partners visiting</h2> <p>On Wednesday morning Victoria\u2019s police minister, Lisa Neville, and the premier, Daniel Andrews, both said partners who lived separately would not be allowed to visit each other under the state\u2019s interpretation of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/01/social-distancing-rules-australia-lockdown-coronavirus-strict-new-laws-legal-illegal-state-physical-restrictions-guidelines-explained-nsw-victoria-qld-queensland-act-sa-wa-two-person\">new restrictions on movement</a>. But by the afternoon<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/australias-coronavirus-lockdown-rules-explained-can-i-still-visit-my-partner-and-other-questions\"> the chief health officer, Brett Sutton, reversed the ruling</a>, saying Victoria had \u201cno desire to penalise individuals who are staying with or meeting their partners if they don\u2019t usually reside together\u201d. Neville subsequently said the initial ban was Sutton\u2019s idea but the change in tack made a mockery of the premier\u2019s insistence that to comply with the new rules Victorians just needed to use \u201ccommon sense\u201d.</p> <h2>Queensland steps up border rules</h2> <p>Queensland will toughen its border shutdown laws from Friday, barring all non-residents from entering the state unless they have been granted an exception. Under the previous rules, people could cross the border provided they self-isolated for 14 days afterwards. But the police minister, Mark Ryan, said on Wednesday that the rules were set to change further.</p> <p>\u201cAnyone who is not a Queensland resident or considered exempt from the restrictions will not be able to enter Queensland from 12.01am Friday, April 3, 2020,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.couriermail.com.au/coronavirus/coronavirus-qld-border-restrictions-to-tighten-to-prevent-spread-of-covid19/news-story/fd5f84b87c91b8a7c9645a51274610b6\">Ryan said in a statement reported by the Courier-Mail</a>.</p> <h2>Crackdown on price-gouging and exports</h2> <p>The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, said the government has amended the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations Act 1958 to stop exploitative exports of essential goods. This took effect on Tuesday.</p> <p>\u201cThe minister for health has now made a determination under the Biosecurity Act 2015<em> </em>to enable the Australian Border Force to require that goods already in their custody be surrendered for provision to the National Medical Stockpile, or destruction if the goods are defective,\u201d Dutton said.</p> <p>The minister said the changes meant people who have<strong> </strong>purchased essential goods at retail can not on-sell them at extortionate price, which is set at 120% of the price for which they were purchased.</p> <p>People who flout these laws would also be forced to \u201csurrender the essential goods to the Australian Federal Police for provision to the National Medical Stockpile, or destruction if the goods are defective\u201d, Dutton said.</p> <h2>Modelling may not be released after all</h2> <p>On Monday the deputy chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, said he would push the national cabinet to unlock modelling on how many Covid-19 cases may be expected in Australia, acknowledging that transparency is essential. New Zealand <a href=\"https://www.health.govt.nz/news-media/media-releases/covid-19-modelling-provides-clear-warning-consequences-not-acting-swiftly-and-decisively\">released a clearer picture of its modelling on Tuesday</a> and there has been pressure on the government by some researchers and health workers to do the same.</p> <p>But Kelly clarified his position on Wednesday, saying while \u201ctransparency can be a very important thing\u201d, modelling could be easily misinterpreted.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to make sure that it\u2019s presented in a way that is useful,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other thing I would say about modelling, and modellers themselves would also say this, modelling is not necessarily the truth. It is a way of seeing the world and potentially pointing out how one can influence certain scenarios. But if we knew the truth and could see exactly what was going to happen in the next few months exactly, then we don\u2019t need to model.\u201d</p> <p>Guardian Australia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/flatten-the-curve-why-predicting-coronavirus-infections-and-deaths-is-so-tricky?CMP=share_btn_tw\">has previously written about why calling for the modelling on Covid-19 is not necessarily a straightforward ask</a>.</p> <h2>Charities call for help</h2> <p>Six of Australia\u2019s leading international aid agencies urged the federal government to include specific measures to help charities continue their lifesaving work in Covid-19 support packages.</p> <p>The organisations \u2013 Care Australia, ChildFund Australia, Oxfam Australia, Plan International Australia, Save the Children Australia and World Vision Australia \u2013 said the not-for-profit sector was facing a perfect storm of falling revenue and unprecedented demand for their services fuelled by the pandemic.</p> <h2>Baggage handlers test positive for Covid-19</h2> <p>Eleven baggage handlers at Adelaide airport have tested positive, with two further cases among family members, taking the cluster of cases associated with the Qantas staff to 13. More than 100 other people related to the cluster, either fellow workers or close contacts, are also in self-isolation.</p> <p>South Australia\u2019s deputy chief public health officer, Michael Cusack, said the outbreak had prompted a change in testing criteria. Anyone who had visited the airport in the past 14 days and who had since developed symptoms was now advised to get tested and self-isolate. But Cusack said health officials had not recommended closing the airport completely \u2013 <em>AAP</em></p> <h2>Prime minister offers a prayer</h2> <p>Scott Morrison <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/01/scott-morrison-prays-for-australia-and-commits-nation-to-god-amid-coronavirus-crisis\">has offered a prayer for the national cabinet</a> to stay \u201cstrong and united\u201d as it responds to Covid-19. On 23 March Morrison called for Australians of faith to pray as parliament reconvened to pass the second tranche of fiscal support.</p> <h2>What you need to know: get the most important information from some of our key explainers</h2> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/australias-coronavirus-lockdown-rules-explained-can-i-still-visit-my-partner-and-other-questions\">Australia\u2019s coronavirus lockdown rules explained: can I still visit my partner and other questions</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2020/apr/01/when-is-it-legal-to-leave-your-home\">Full Story podcast: when is it legal to leave your home?</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/datablog/2020/apr/01/is-australia-flattening-the-coronavirus-curve-look-at-the-charts-\">Is Australia flattening the coronavirus curve?

Victoria\u2019s history. </p> \n   <p>We currently have about 450, about 500 intensive care beds in Victoria. </p> \n   <p>And now, we\u2019re going to fund another 4,000 intensive care beds, taking us to a total of 4,500. </p> \n   <p>So essentially, what the package will pay for is firstly some capital funding there to create new spaces for intensive care beds at the Alfred, Monash and at the Austin hospitals, so that will create another 300 new spaces, on top of the 269 beds that we announced recently. </p> \n   <p>And in addition to that, the vast bulk of this funding is actually for the

After downplaying the significance of the virus for weeks, he was forced to declare a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/donald-trump-coronavirus-national-emergency\">national emergency</a>. Having backtracked last week, asserting that the lockdown would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/24/trump-coronavirus-us-easter-new-york-fauci-birx\">end by Easter</a> to avoid damaging the economy, he has now conceded it will have to last until the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/trump-says-keeping-us-covid-19-deaths-to-100000-would-be-a-very-good-job\">end of April</a>. It is true that his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2020/mar/24/trump-pandemic-floundering-coronavirus-crisis\">approval ratings have gone up</a>, paralleling what happened with George W Bush after September 11. But Trump is clearly worried about the electoral consequences of a massive death toll and a recession that could see unemployment of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/26/us-unemployment-rate-coronavirus-business\">over 20%</a>.</p> <p>The difficulties experienced by national populists are unsurprising given they are no friends of the issues at the heart of this crisis: health, welfare and science. On the health front, the crisis reveals the folly of decades of underfunding and privatisation of the health system. Trump, Johnson and Salvini have embarrassing questions to answer in regard to their record as enemies of public healthcare. Furthermore, the crisis calls for a sea change in economic policy that is at odds with the ideological premises of national populism, which combines chauvinism on the cultural front and ultra-neoliberal policies on the economic front.</p> <p>The glaring need for state protection of strategic national industries, starting with health equipment and pharmaceuticals, is no anathema for national-populists who have already embraced trade protectionism. But the populist right has strongly opposed welfare measures that are becoming a matter of necessity <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/24/coronavirus-crisis-change-world-financial-global-capitalism\">to avoid social catastrophe.</a> Having repeatedly branded these policies as \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201canti-patriotic\u201d, these politicians find themselves in the embarrassing situation of having to espouse them.</p> <p>Another skeleton in the closet is national-populists\u2019 disparagement of science. The coronavirus emergency confronts us with a threat that is best understood and measured through the lens of science. Epidemiologists and virologists have acquired media prominence and the public has been diligently following their recommendations. It is not clear whether this will lead to greater public trust in science and an erosion of the anti-science attitudes that national populist leaders have toyed with. However, it can be expected that citizens will take more heed of the risks flagged by scientists, including the climate emergency, which is also bound to exacerbate the spread of diseases.</p> <p>National-populists are well known for stoking people\u2019s fears. But the fears now prevalent are not of the kind these leaders are best positioned to exploit. Due to the urgency of health and economic worries, migration \u2013 the populist right\u2019s main enemy \u2013 has fallen in the list of priorities. Travel bans, and the fact that Europe and the US are the present focus of the pandemic, are leading to a drop in migration to these regions. In fact, we are now witnessing a historic reversal, with Mexico aiming to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-52053656\">block</a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-52053656\"> the border</a> with the US and African countries suspending flights from Europe, while UK farmers are organising charter planes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/28/fruit-and-veg-will-run-out-unless-britain-charters-planes-to-fly-in-farm-workers-from-eastern-europe\">to fly in farm workers from eastern Europe</a> to prevent fruit and vegetables being left unpicked. However, if the global economic crisis results in a new wave of migration like that of 2015, this scenario could drastically change \u2013 national-populists will try to validate their narrative of cosmopolitan globalisation as a dangerous vector of all sorts of ills.</p> <p>If the coronavirus crisis has momentarily disoriented the populist right, this does not mean it is vanquished. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/27/coronavirus-populism-trump-politics-response\">It would be misguided for the left</a> to believe that this crisis will work out in its favour. The health crisis is bound to be followed by a deep economic crisis, more similar to the Great Depression than to the 2008 financial crisis, and the populist right has already demonstrated its ability to prey on popular despair and find social scapegoats for economic ills. It can be expected that it will go down the same road, if anything becoming even more vicious.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/hungary-jail-for-coronavirus-misinformation-viktor-orban\">authoritarian measures</a> implemented on Monday by Viktor Orb\u00e1n in Hungary, with the suspension of parliament and the introduction of government by decree, may be the shape of things to come. In Italy, Salvini had no qualms about applauding Orb\u00e1n\u2019s move. We are also likely to see an exacerbation of anti-Chinese rhetoric. Trump made no apologies for calling Covid-19 \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1239685852093169664?lang=en\">the Chinese virus</a>\u201d, while Steve Bannon <a href=\"https://adncuba.com/english/steve-bannon-covid-19-communist-party-virus-trump\">argued</a> that Covid-19 is a \u201cChinese Communist Party virus\u201d. Salvini <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/31/china-isnt-helping-italy-its-waging-information-warfare/\">has proposed</a> that \u201cif the Chinese government knew [about the virus] and didn\u2019t tell it publicly, it committed a crime against humanity\u201d, and allies in Brazil and Spain are adopting a similar line.</p> <p>Given the ties among national-populists, including their botched attempt to establish a \u201cnationalist international\u201d under the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/21/steve-bannons-rightwing-europe-operation-undermined-by-election-laws\">auspices of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/21/steve-bannons-rightwing-europe-operation-undermined-by-election-laws\">Bannon\u2019s Movement</a>, this synchrony should not be taken as accidental. It has all the look of a coordinated strategy to channel the rage and despair caused by the crisis\u2019s brutal human and economic toll towards a racial and ideological enemy conveniently identified in the Chinese government. Along with self-proclaimed socialists, all opponents are likely to be smeared as \u201cChinese collaborationists\u201d: centrist US presidential candidate Joe Biden has already been termed <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/03/joe-biden-is-chinas-choice-for-president/\">\u201cChina\u2019s choice for president\u201d</a> by the conservative National Review.</p> <p>What may be in store is thus something much worse than the populist right of the 2010s: an extreme right using the whole arsenal of the red scare and rightwing authoritarianism to intimidate opponents and defend its interests from demands for meaningful economic redistribution. Though it has been confounded by this crisis, the populist right has not been suppressed.

  "<p>One morning toward the end of January 2019, Steve Lewis, a US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) biologist in Juneau, Alaska, logged on to the website Movebank.org to check the whereabouts of some golden eagles that he had tagged with GPS trackers.</p> <p>Lewis, a lanky, outdoorsy 49-year-old, usually tried to look at the location data once a week, but he had spent most of the month at home on furlough, unable to work as a result of the government shutdown. Eager to catch up with his birds, Lewis beelined it to his office when he got back to work. \u201cThe first thing I did,\u201d he says, \u201cwas go and check on my eagle tags.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/22/florida-python-action-team-snake-epidemic\">Python wars: the snake epidemic eating away at Florida</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One bird in particular, Golden Eagle 1703, gave him pause. Lewis knew the animal well. He had tagged it on 26 July 2017, when it was still a nestling on a rocky outcrop in Denali national park and preserve. Even before it knew how to fly, 1703 displayed its might by leaping from its nest and gliding a quarter mile down a valley to evade Lewis\u2019s initial attempt at tagging it. After a short hike, Lewis and his team retrieved the squawking bundle of black and white feathers, outfitted it with the tracking device, and returned it safely to its nest.</p> <p>In the 18 months that followed, 1703 flourished. The bird traversed about 8,000 miles, from Denali to Wyoming, all the way back up to Alaska\u2019s North Slope, where it probably feasted on waterfowl and perhaps a straggling caribou calve of two. From there, it carved a long, treacherous path south through the wilderness of western Canada and worked its way back to the lower 48 to hunker down for its second winter on Earth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"001574e33585518534fd1945c9aebb3d21f6e8b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/001574e33585518534fd1945c9aebb3d21f6e8b5/0_0_3024_4032/750.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Lewis tagging Eagle 1703 .\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Biologist Steve Lewis getting ready to return Golden Eagle 1703 to its nest in Denali national park and preserve after outfitting the bird with a solar-powered GPS device in July 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carol McIntyre, National Park Service</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Little is known about what golden eagles do in the liminal years between leaving their parents\u2019 nest and settling down to build a nest of their own. Each ping from 1703\u2019s solar-powered GPS revealed a tiny part of the picture, offering a rare glimpse of an apex predator as it learned the ropes of the natural world. \u201cIt takes four or five years for them to reach maturity,\u201d Lewis says, \u201cand it\u2019s unknown how long it actually takes them to then compete and get into the breeding population. So you have to follow a bird for years.\u201d</p> <p>But now, staring at his computer screen on that January morning, Lewis could see that 1703\u2019s location device was stationary in Sully county, South Dakota, and had been so for two days. \u201cIt was seeing the sun and talking to the satellites,\u201d Lewis says, \u201cbut it wasn\u2019t moving.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not uncommon for Lewis to lose a bird. Since 2014, he, along with colleagues from the National Park Service and the US Geological Survey, have tagged 49 golden eagles in Alaska as part of a broader effort to understand their biology, behavior and population trends. Of those birds, only 17 are still being monitored. Sometimes the GPS device malfunctions or the eagle shakes free from it. Other times the bird dies.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a tough world out there,\u201d Lewis tells me, \u201cespecially for eagles.\u201d They can starve to death or get electrocuted by high wires or be decapitated by wind turbines. None of those fates, however, seemed likely in the rolling farmland of Sully county.</p> <p>Hoping to get a sense of what went wrong, Lewis opened a souped-up version of Google Earth, plugged in the last GPS coordinates he had for 1703, and began looking around the virtual landscape. There was a nearby road, a line of trees, acres of empty land, and what looked to be a farmhouse. \u201cIt definitely felt suspicious,\u201d Lewis says.</p> <p>He called up a Fish and Wildlife office in Pierre, South Dakota, and asked if anyone could go check on a downed eagle tag.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Richard Bare wasn\u2019t sure whether to be pissed off or deeply disappointed by the prospect of having to retrieve yet another dead eagle. \u201cI first and foremost suspected a shooting because we were having a rash of eagle shootings,\u201d says Bare, a special agent with FWS\u2019s office of law enforcement, who was stationed in South Dakota at the time. In the five weeks leading up to 1703\u2019s death, he had responded to a bald eagle shooting and two separate golden eagle shootings. None of the birds survived, and he found no evidence to suggest the incidents were related. The case of 1703 seemed like more of the same.</p> <p>While the average American might be shocked to learn of an eagle being intentionally blasted from the sky, those who work in wildlife law enforcement know it\u2019s an alarmingly common problem. According to one <a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/pdf/management/EagleRuleRevisions-StatusReport.pdf\">FWS report</a>, somewhere in the range of 1,000 golden eagles are shot each year. Sometimes it\u2019s poachers who want to sell the bird\u2019s feathers on the black market, other times it\u2019s ranchers who want to keep the dive-bombing predators from snatching their livestock.</p> <p>Bare, who has been a special agent since 2016 and before that spent close to a decade in the field as an FWS game warden (the outdoor world\u2019s equivalent of a beat cop) ballparks that over the course of his career he\u2019s dealt with upwards of 200 cases involving eagles \u2013 shootings, poisonings, collisions with cars, starvations. \u201cIf you asked me about any other eagle, I probably wouldn\u2019t remember it,\u201d he says. But 1703 \u201cwas a flashbulb event\u201d because the weather was memorably miserable, even by South Dakota standards. A punishing cold snap had plunged temperatures well below zero while sustained winds of 50mph ripped across the plains.</p> <p>After a quick chat with Lewis, Bare loaded his cold-weather gear into his truck and hit the road. 1703\u2019s GPS tracker was pinging about five miles north-west of where the Oahe Dam cuts across the Missouri River to form Lake Oahe, one of the nation\u2019s largest man-made reservoirs and fertile hunting ground for birds of prey.</p> <p>When Bare arrived at the location, he saw all the same features that had popped up on Lewis\u2019s computer screen \u2013 the quiet country road, the shelter belt of trees and the farmhouse, which in real life was dilapidated and long ago abandoned. A firm layer of snow crunched under his boots as he walked across the field, scanning the ground for any signs of an eagle or an errant GPS tag. Then, among the knee-high wheat reeds that poked through the frozen landscape, Bare spotted what looked to be a clump of tail feathers. He took out his camera and began documenting everything. \u201cEven though something might not be a criminal investigation, I have to treat it as such and maintain the integrity of the evidence,\u201d he says, \u201cthe evidence being the eagle in this case.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5999c7ad4afaaf65630b39bc463c737a754f9cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5999c7ad4afaaf65630b39bc463c737a754f9cd/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eagle 1703 found in a field in South Dakota.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A bundle of 1703\u2019s feathers poke through the ground in Sully county, South Dakota.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FWS Special Agent Richard Bare</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Only two species of eagles are native to the US \u2013 the bald eagle and the golden eagle \u2013 and few animals in the world enjoy as many legal protections as they do. In addition to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Lacy Act, which regulates the trade of wildlife, they are privy to the <a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/midwest/eagle/history/protections.html\">Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act</a>, a federal statute that threatens steep fines and jail time for anyone caught killing eagles, disrupting their nests, or generally interfering with the birds.</p> <p>Passed in 1940, the law was originally designed to protect only bald eagles. At the time, the species was teetering on the edge of extinction in the contiguous US as a result of hunting, habitat loss and the toxic effects of DDT. In 1962, Congress amended the act to include golden eagles. Nearly 50 years later, the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act has proven to be a godsend, at least for bald eagles. The national bird is widely considered one of the 20th century\u2019s greatest environmental comeback stories: in 1963, a mere 417 nesting pairs lived in the lower 48. Today well over 10,000 pairs can be found from the suburbs of Boston to garbage dumps near Seattle.</p> <p>Golden eagles haven\u2019t been as lucky. While they are not classified as an endangered or threatened species, they certainly aren\u2019t thriving. FWS estimates that in 1967, there were 31,813 golden eagles in the US. In 2014, the most recent year for which data is available, the agency estimated there were 31,477 golden eagles in our skies. It\u2019s a remarkable stretch of stability, but it\u2019s unclear if the numbers can hold as wind farms rise across the western US and myriad pressures from habitat loss, environmental degradation and the climate crisis push down on raptors and the animals they prey upon.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>In 1963, a mere 417 nesting pairs of bald eagles lived in the lower 48. Today, well over 10,000 pairs exist</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>With so many threats looming, Bare knows as well as anyone that the last thing golden eagles need are people shooting them out of the sky. After a few minutes of photographing the area, he dug 1703\u2019s frozen carcass out from under the snow and gave it a once over in the wind-whipped field. Much to his surprise, there were no overt signs of trauma \u2013 no bloody bullet hole or broken wing or spilled guts. The bird weighed more than 7lb and, aside from being dead, looked to be in good shape. Still, there was no telling what type of damage might be lurking under its plumage. Bare zipped 1703 into a small body bag and chewed over the possibilities on his drive back to the office.</p> <p>A day or two later, a preliminary X-ray seemed to support his original hunch when it revealed two metal fragments near one of 1703\u2019s wings. \u201cIt resembled the approximate diameter of buckshot,\u201d Bare says. Following protocol, he packed 1703 on ice and FedExed it to the National Fish &amp; Wildlife Forensics Laboratory in Ashland, Oregon.</p> <p>Like that, 1703 had gone from a high-flying predator to commercial cargo.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>On any given day, a menagerie of dead animals passes through the FWS\u2019s forensics lab. From the outside, the building looks like most any other government facility \u2013 squat, gray, plenty of parking. Inside, it\u2019s filled with sophisticated laboratory equipment and staffed by a small, exquisitely specialized team of scientists whose disciplines range from herpetology to ornithology to ballistics to genetics. When it comes to analyzing evidence of animal-related crimes and building scientifically sound prosecutions against wildlife traffickers, poachers and others who inflict harm on nature\u2019s inhabitants, there is no better place on earth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dbd18a3d2dd917acafbe70e6f54bcd66d8cfef02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbd18a3d2dd917acafbe70e6f54bcd66d8cfef02/507_0_1506_1784/844.jpg\" alt=\"A group of bald and golden eagles feed on a fish on the frozen surface of the Mississippi River near LaCrescent, Minnesota.\" width=\"844\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A group of bald and golden eagles feed on a fish on the frozen surface of the Mississippi River near LaCrescent, Minnesota.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Fredrickson/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like any potential murder victim, 1703 underwent a full postmortem in hopes of pinpointing the cause of death. That task fell to Rebecca Kagan, one of two staff pathologists at the lab. If there\u2019s a federally protected animal that dies under mysterious circumstances, there\u2019s a decent chance it will end up on Kagan\u2019s exam table. One day it\u2019s an endangered Mexican gray wolf; the next day an eagle.</p> <p>\u201cWe get a lot of bald and golden eagles,\u201d Kagan laments. In 2019, she and the other pathologist at the lab necropsied about 100 eagles total, including 1703. Managing an endless stream of suspiciously dead animals can be bleak. But Kagan keeps a sharp sense of humor \u2013 she jokes that she always carves the bird at Thanksgiving \u2013 and finds comfort in knowing that her work is ultimately in service of conservation. Sometimes a necropsy yields evidence that helps finger the bad guy. Other times her efforts reveal that there wasn\u2019t any foul play, just the lethal hand of Mother Nature at work.</p> <p>Kagan unpacked 1703 on 13 February 2019, roughly three weeks after Lewis first noticed its GPS at a standstill. Dribs of a red-brown fluid leaked from the bird\u2019s mouth when she tilted its carcass. She checked the esophagus and it was empty. She checked the crop, a pouch-like structure near the upper part of the digestive tract, and found a 3.5oz blob of partially masticated muscle and fat mixed with a few white hairs that looked like they came from a deer. \u201cThe nutritional condition was good,\u201d Kagan recalls. \u201cThis bird didn\u2019t starve to death.\u201d</p> <p>Slowly and methodically, she worked 1703 over, inspecting and documenting every inch of its insides and outsides. A large amount of \u201cwatery, red-tinged\u201d excrement pooled in its cloaca and its gall bladder contained \u201cscant, yellow-green, watery bile\u201d, according to the necropsy report.</p> <p>Kagan eventually arrived at the two metal pellets that showed up on the preliminary X-ray only to discover that they were nothing more than tiny remnants from the GPS harness. Hours spent deconstructing 1703, and the cause of death wasn\u2019t any clearer. \u201cIt\u2019s a little frustrating,\u201d she tells me. \u201cWe really checked everything with this bird.\u201d</p> <p>As a final step, she shipped 1703\u2019s liver to Michigan State University for a detailed toxicology analysis. A few weeks later the results came back positive for bromadiolone, better known as rat poison.</p> <p>Even if you\u2019ve never heard of bromadiolone or its chemical counterparts \u2013brodifacoum difenacoum and difethialone \u2013 chances are you\u2019ve been in close proximity to them. They are known as \u201csecond-generation anticoagulant rodenticides\u201d, a popular class of poisons that essentially kills a rodent by making it bleed to death from the inside out. Exterminators stuff these poisons in those black plastic bait boxes that you see everywhere in cities \u2013 down alleys, on the sides of restaurants, in condo buildings\u2019 parking lots \u2013 and they are deployed throughout the agricultural sector to keep germ-carrying rodents away from food supplies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"56d64ac6fd464002669cdfb0e583d8e523081343\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56d64ac6fd464002669cdfb0e583d8e523081343/0_0_3400_2403/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A juvenile male golden eagle flies back into the wild at the Starr Ranch Sanctuary after being released on Friday, July 1, 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"707\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A juvenile male golden eagle flies back into the wild at the Starr Ranch Sanctuary after being released on 1 July 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MediaNews Group/Orange County Register via Getty Images/MediaNews Group via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These poisons came to prominence in the late 1970s and early 1980s and were \u201cextremely widely embraced\u201d from the get-go, says Bobby Corrigan, an esteemed rodentologist who has spent his career studying and consulting on pest control practices. \u201cIt was kind of a magic bullet of advanced chemistry.\u201d</p> <p>Corrigan frequently preaches the importance of addressing the root causes of rodent infestations \u2013 improving trash storage and collection, addressing degrading infrastructure \u2013 and is unsettled by the widespread reliance on second-generation anticoagulants and lax enforcement efforts by the Environmental Protection Agency to restrict their use. But \u2013 and this is an important, he says \u2013 the sad truth is that we are dependent on these poisons. Forgoing them entirely would lead to an explosion in rodent populations that could usher in \u201ca public health catastrophe\u201d.</p> <p>One reason these poisons are so effective is because, in most cases, the rat or ground squirrel or vole or whatever the target vermin happens to be only needs to eat a single dose. The poison works quickly, and the critter typically doesn\u2019t have time to excrete any of the poison before it keels over. In other words, a rat that dies from a second-generation anticoagulant often dies with a belly fully of poison. And if a scavenger comes along and plucks up the rodent corpse, it, too, will be exposed to the poison. It\u2019s a process that scientists call bioaccumulation, and it occurs all the way up the food chain.</p> <p>Just like mercury in the ocean, these rat poisons have seeped into ecosystems far and wide. A<a href=\"https://www.cdpr.ca.gov/docs/registration/reevaluation/2018_investigation_anticoagulant.pdf\"> 2018 study</a> from the California department of pesticide regulation found detectable levels of second-generation anticoagulants in roughly 85% of mountain lions, bobcats and Pacific fishers that were examined. Birds of prey, including eagles, are especially at risk for these types of \u201cnon-target animal\u201d exposures. Maureen Murray of the Cummings school of veterinary medicine at Tufts University <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28669046\">analyzed</a> 94 birds of prey from New England and found traces of these poisons in a stunning 96% of them. \u201cWe can say confidently that there\u2019s widespread exposure,\u201d Murray says. \u201cBut how that translates into mortality or deaths is still very much an unanswered question.\u201d</p> <p>The toxicology report for 1703 showed that it had 0.05 parts per million of bromadiolone in its liver. Murray says it\u2019s unlikely that\u2019s enough to directly kill an eagle, but there\u2019s not really any good data on what the lethal threshold is for a bird of that size. If the poison didn\u2019t deal the fatal blow, I ask, could it have impaired 1703 in a way that made the bird less capable of hunting or migrating or withstanding the winter and thus contributing to its death? Again, Murray says, it\u2019s an important question to which there\u2019s no answer. And even worse, it\u2019s becoming an increasingly difficult question to study because, Murray explains, so many raptors in the wild now have rodenticide in them that it\u2019s almost impossible to find enough birds that are free of rat poison to serve as a control group.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"461aff0e5f7b8b3dbb604d376d3a285e4f10c281\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/461aff0e5f7b8b3dbb604d376d3a285e4f10c281/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wildlife repository specialist Dennis Wiist looks for a place to hang eagles ready to be sent out in one of the two freezers.

It\u2019s a fate that many golden eagles suffer. While data is scarce, FWS scientists estimate that poisonings are now the leading cause of anthropogenic-induced death among golden eagles, possibly killing as many as 2,000 a year.</p> <p>Kagan\u2019s exam table was the end of the line for 1703. Sometimes an eagle can be sent to the <a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/eaglerepository/\">National Eagle</a><a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/eaglerepository/\"> Repository</a>, which distributes deceased eagles to Native American tribes so they can use the animals for ceremonial purposes. 1703 would not find any such greater meaning in death, however, because the eagle repository, according to an FWS spokesperson, cannot distribute eagles exposed to rodenticides.</p> <p>On 7 March 2019, Kagan filed the official necropsy report and moved on to the next animal carcass in her queue.</p> <p>Without any evidence of a clearcut crime and an ever-expanding caseload, Bare closed the file on 1703 and retrained his focus on the spate of eagle shootings.</p> <p>And out in Juneau, Lewis logged 1703\u2019s data and carried on monitoring the 17 other golden eagles that are still tagged and up in the air, hoping they avoid the wind turbines and high-voltage wires and blasts of buckshot and poisoned prey that have made the natural world so unnaturally dangerous for the species.</p> <p>\u201cI know that death is a reality,\u201d Lewis says, \u201cbut it\u2019s really frustrating when it seems like it\u2019s a senseless death.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 10 April 2020 to correct the name of the National Eagle Repository. </p></li> </ul>",

  "<p>While Hollywood has slowly started to embrace a more diverse landscape, inspirational depictions of African Americans prospering remain an unfortunate rarity. This year\u2019s Oscars drove the point home quite clearly, with Cynthia Erivo as the lone black acting nominee, playing runaway slave Harriet Tubman. The same year saw snubs for Lupita Nyong\u2019o in Us and Eddie Murphy in Dolemite is My Name, both playing more contemporary characters with agency. It added credence to the long-held suspicion that in order for a performance by a black actor to break out, there needs to be some form of abuse or subservience to gain recognition. Previous wins by Octavia Spencer in The Help, Lupita Nyong\u2019o in 12 Years A Slave and Mahershala Ali in Green Book highlight this. Yes, these experiences form a majority of the black experience in America \u2013 but what does it mean that Hollywood is primarily interested in black characters overburdened with obstacles and adversity?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/20/self-made-review-octavia-spencer\">Self Made review \u2013 Octavia Spencer sparkles in inspiring Netflix drama</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Thankfully, two new works, both on streaming platforms and based on true events, work to combat this trend. The Netflix bio-series Self-Made features Octavia Spencer as haircare entrepreneur Madam CJ Walker and tracks how a black woman became the first self-made female millionaire in a segregated, early-20th-century America. The other is the Apple TV film The Banker, which sees two men become two of the first black bankers in America through clever trickery, astute real estate decisions, and coaching a white man to pose as the face of their business.</p> <p>A common thread linking these two narratives, separated by four decades, is the unique pressures black-owned businesses face in America. Their paths to success and prosperity are neither orthodox nor simple. For Madam CJ Walker and Joe Morris and Barnard Garrett (The Banker\u2019s main characters), making it in America requires not only creativity. There\u2019s also the weighted responsibility of lifting up the entire black community along with you. As Walker exclaims in one scene, pitching her haircare products to a group of black women eager to climb the ladder, \u201cWhen one of us looks good, we all look good!\u201d Walker was noted for hiring and training more than 20,000 black workers for her company. Morris and Garrett issued scores of loans to black business owners which, in the 60s, were unfairly viewed as \u201chigh-risk loans\u201d by white bankers and frequently denied. We\u2019re shown that a black business succeeding results in a black community succeeding too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ffa4f5fb6a7bcf30f23dc5848e254c1a45a1fdf0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ffa4f5fb6a7bcf30f23dc5848e254c1a45a1fdf0/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Octavia Spencer in Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J.

There are scant white characters. So the racism Walker encounters, initially, is internalized within the all-black community she lives in. Back then (and even today), black beauty hair products exalted eurocentric or \u201cmixed\u201d beauty ideals. In the series, Walker\u2019s main competitor is a light-skinned black woman who uses colorism to her financial advantage, telling Walker, who is dark-skinned, \u201cColored women will do anything to look like me. Even if deep down they know they can\u2019t.\u201d Then there were the black men, like the noted activist Booker T Washington, who refused to see a beauty business as seriously advancing the \u201cnegro cause\u201d. The confluence of sexism and racism shines bright.</p> <p>Meanwhile, The Banker\u2019s depiction of black business highlights a common adage within the community \u2013 \u201cYou have to be twice as good to get half of what they have.\u201d \u201cThey\u201d being white people, of course. Barnard Garrett is a gifted businessman able to perform complex calculations in his head while conducting intense contract negotiations. He amasses a small, but substantial, fortune through purchasing properties on the borders of white neighborhoods and leasing them to affluent black renters. But Garrett\u2019s talent for flipping real estate is not good enough. He still encounters white businessmen who are unwilling to take him seriously because of his race in a consciously segregated LA (not a landscape modern viewers may immediately associate with such blatant racism). Garrett\u2019s inability to turn himself into a mogul is not through lack of talent, but lack of opportunity \u2013 a reality numerous people of color were, and still are, forced to contend with.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f2deb1e3efe4aad4372875bedb9a4bc9cbc6b13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f2deb1e3efe4aad4372875bedb9a4bc9cbc6b13/0_0_3504_2336/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anthony Mackie and Samuel L Jackson in The Banker\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anthony Mackie and Samuel L Jackson in The Banker.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Apple TV+/Kyle Bono Kaplan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While scenes of Garrett and Morris teaching a white handyman (played by Nicholas Hoult) math equations, golfing and the art of fine dining are framed as comedic and lighthearted, prepping him to be their stand-in for business deals, they feel like the manifestation of a deeper, darker reality in America. It\u2019s not just about ideas and talent for black business owners.</p> <p>Black-owned businesses still face serious pressures in America. For one, there\u2019s not a lot of them. In 2012, the Census Bureau <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/newsroom/releases/2015/cb15-209_graphic.jpg\">reported</a> only 9.7% of business owners were black, compared with 83% being white. This has resulted in \u201cbuying black\u201d growing increasingly hard, as explored by Killer Mike in an episode of <a href=\"https://kulturehub.com/killer-mike-black-owned-business/\">his Netflix show Trigger Warning</a>. The rapper/activist gave himself the mission of living off only products and services produced by black-owned businesses \u2013 which proved nearly impossible. Our current moment lacks a modern Madam CJ Walker, despite the purchasing power of black buyers steadily growing: 70% of beauty hair supply stores catering to black hair types are owned by Asian Americans.</p> <p>Hopefully Hollywood expands on these kinds of narratives, which certainly serve more purpose than a \u201cwhite savior\u201d plotline such as that of Green Book. They remind me of black-centric films such as the Ice Cube-led, mid-aughts Barbershop franchise and its spinoff Beauty Shop.

  "<p>For 900 years, Lugg and Hampton wildflower meadows in Herefordshire have bloomed into a wash of colour in spring. These fertile meadows were highly prized, and the Norman lords who owned them used the hay crop to help fund Hereford\u2019s cathedrals, churches and castles. The secret to their wonderful bounty was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/nov/10/top-10-winter-wild-swimming-spots-in-britain\">River Lugg</a> flowing through the middle, fertilising the valley floor with lime and silt each winter it flooded.</p> <p>But this longstanding system is broken. This winter the valley was submerged under several feet of chocolate-coloured water. It has been flooded almost continuously since October, turning the 120-hectare (297-acre) reserve into an inland lake, with just the tops of gates and fence posts peeping out of the water. Now, as spring approaches, the water is still several inches deep and swans and gulls frolic where mice and rabbits would have burrowed six months earlier.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/lugg-zip/giv-3902YD0Lv95egvWX/\" data-alt=\"map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/lugg-zip/giv-3902YD0Lv95egvWX/\">map</a> </figure>  <p>The damage flooding does to humans has been well-documented, but wildlife populations are unseen casualties, with some ecosystems taking decades to recover. \u201cIt is frightening to think that we have only just begun to see what might be ahead with our climate. The losses could be profound,\u201d says James Hitchcock from Herefordshire Wildlife Trust, which manages the Lugg reserve.</p> <p>\u201cThe rate of change we are seeing and the repetition in extreme events is coming too fast for wildlife to adapt \u2026 The loss of these meadows could take years and years to reverse and we may never see a return of some species.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"be1548addebc45f3ccdc31b58d00f39401a5eb3c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be1548addebc45f3ccdc31b58d00f39401a5eb3c/0_0_4574_3044/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Snakeshead flowers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lugg wildflower meadows in Herefordshire are home to rare species of plants such as the \u2018Snakeskin\u2019 flower.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Holden Landscapes/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Damage to wetland habitats</strong></h2> <p>Months of flooding is turning Lugg meadows anoxic as oxygen is lost. Worms and other insects suffocate and come to the surface where they are picked off by scavengers such as foxes and crows, reducing the larder of food for rarer species that rely on the reserve in spring. Many delicate grass species like vernal grass and red fescue are likely to be weakened by the floods, leaving a flush of resistant weed species such as thuggish dock leaves and thistles to take their place. In 2012, conservationists resorted to weedkiller to get rid of the dock leaves because the valley had been too wet.</p> <p>These meadows are highly valuable <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/22/more-than-one-in-10-of-englands-wildlife-sites-lost-since-2009\">sites of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/22/more-than-one-in-10-of-englands-wildlife-sites-lost-since-2009\"> special </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/22/more-than-one-in-10-of-englands-wildlife-sites-lost-since-2009\"> scientific </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/22/more-than-one-in-10-of-englands-wildlife-sites-lost-since-2009\"> interest</a> (SSSIs) and were home to Herefordshire\u2019s only fledged curlew chick last year.

If flooding becomes too frequent, meticulously managed flood plains like this turn into swamps.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8bb1d624c4a6c157c4a2dfa804e1b525285c318f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8bb1d624c4a6c157c4a2dfa804e1b525285c318f/0_126_1703_1129/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bombus ruderarius (red-shanked carder bee) pictured on kidney vetch flower.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bombus ruderarius (Red-shanked carder bee), formerly widespread in the area.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steven Falk/Courtesy of CEH</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The casualties are far-reaching \u2013 otters that live in the Lugg have been killed on roads after being forced into areas where there is less cover. Kingfisher nests normally built into the muddy banks have been submerged under several feet of water. Soil in the water also chokes filter feeders such as dragonfly and damsel larva.</p> <p>The decline of this rural valley, once rich in meaning and memories, is part of what Hitchcock calls the \u201chomogenisation of the countryside\u201d. All over the country, generalist species like rooks, crows and gulls thrive at the expense of specialised species that are picky about their habitat. Only around 1,200 hectares of species-rich flood plain meadows remain in the whole of the UK, with most of them lost due to the intensification of agriculture. Many of these rare species have nowhere to migrate to if their habitat is destroyed.</p> <p>\u201cThis flooding is one element in a general narrative of decline. When flooding is this prolonged, insects and vertebrates start to die and that includes things like earthworms. It then takes years to recover. In that intervening period you have less food for birds and potentially the loss of some species. Everything is getting hit from every angle,\u201d says Hitchcock.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f07b636bffdfdafc123f236ecd40f26790a17994\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f07b636bffdfdafc123f236ecd40f26790a17994/0_0_5464_3640/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flooded fields following Storm Dennis in February 2020 at Symonds Yat, Herefordshire, England.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A series of storms over the winter of 2019-20 caused repeated flooding in Herefordshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Farther down the Lugg at Bodenham Lake, prolonged flooding may have drowned 1,500 young reeds, planted in 2019 as part of a \u00a3520,000 project managed by the Herefordshire Wildlife Trust to create more habitats for declining wetland species such as warblers and bearded tits.</p> <p>Sophie Cowling, senior project officer at Lugg Living Landscape, says: \u201cThe lake\u2019s water levels have been extremely high since the end of October, due to repeated flooding. The floodwaters have fully submerged the young reed plants; if they drown it will be costly to replace them and the conservation of declining wildlife that relies on reedbeds will be delayed by several years.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Damage to river ecosystems</strong></h2> <p>Thirty miles south-west is the village of Llanwenarth in the Abergavenny district in Monmouthshire, Wales. Two 16th-century manor houses and a church perched on land raised from the flood plain are a nod to former rural communities that once thrived in these valleys. The 16th-century houses had never flooded until earlier this year when they had three feet of water running through. The damage to the valley exceeded the three previous large floods in 1853, 1947 and 1979.</p> <p>Fortunately these floods were not at a time when fish were spawning but their regularity worries Simon Evans, chief executive of the Wye and Usk Foundation. \u201cIn the Usk we\u2019ve had record floods in 2018, 2019 and now in 2020. That\u2019s three massive floods in the last 20 months. Imagine each one as a bang on the ecology \u2013 if you keep hitting it it just goes away. Rivers just cannot survive flood after flood after flood.\u201d</p> <p>Fast-moving water causes gravel at the bottom of rivers \u2013 which is key for river ecosystems \u2013 to be ripped away and spat out farther downstream. Macroinvertebrates such as bull head, stone larch and marsh brown lose their homes, says Evans. \u201cThese animals are the life-support systems in the river. They provide food for the dippers and the fish, which provide food for the kingfisher, so if you don\u2019t have the macroinvertebrates because you have taken away their houses then your whole ecology is done.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"070046a1416315e2e80b5193742172ce4475fb79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/070046a1416315e2e80b5193742172ce4475fb79/0_0_3508_2335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Courtship behavior of a pair of kingfishers.

A single flood can impact populations for decades to come; the 1977 flood at Selkirk in the Scottish Borders washed away salmon eggs that had just been laid in the gravel and the effects were apparent on spring salmon catches in the River Tweed 25 years later, according to Evans.</p> <p>In September 2012 more than 200,000 tonnes of soil left the Lugg in one flood, the equivalent of 26 hectares of top soil. There is up to 150mg of soil per litre of water in many of these rivers, and roads are visibly stained red after the water has subsided. This is caused by water flooding agricultural land \u2013 much of which is bare after being harvested for maize or root vegetables \u2013 and washing valuable topsoil into rivers. This soil is often doused in pesticides and fertilisers which cause additional damage to river ecosystems.</p> <p>\u201cOur rivers are not adapted to these elevated sediment loads, and our ecology is not adapted to elevated sediment loads. We should not see big brown rivers sliding past but what we see is big brown rivers sliding past and that\u2019s because of how we manage our land. We\u2019ve got this shifting baselines thing going on \u2013 people think the Lugg has always been brown but it hasn\u2019t,\u201d says Evans.</p> <p>Eggs in the gravel rely on flowing water to bring them oxygen and remove waste, but soil blocks up these holes and reduces the amount of water reaching the eggs, meaning they can suffocate and die. It also reduces visibility so river creatures cannot hunt so easily.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d62d29cb23ecccaa68962e8fd08980f550591ce9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d62d29cb23ecccaa68962e8fd08980f550591ce9/0_0_6240_4160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Record breaking high water levels in the river Wye at Monmouth, February 2020.2B06R6P Record breaking high water levels in the river Wye at Monmouth, February 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Record-breaking high water levels in the river Wye at Monmouth in February</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Cheshire/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Divided communities</strong></h2> <p>Historically these traditional farming communities would have been centres for human trade, migration and settlement, but the battle to control water is dividing communities. Tris Pearce, an ecologist and trustee of the Badger Trust, grew up in the Welsh borders where the Severn and Vyrnwy rivers meet. He monitors badger setts near Pentre, Shrewsbury, which sits close to the border between England and Wales. Here, the roads have turned into rivers intersected with islands of tarmac. Some areas have been underwater for more than three and a half months.</p> <p>For badgers, late winter storms come at the worst time because cubs are in underground dens and will drown unless the sow can get them out (which she does by picking them up in her mouth one by one). Pearson feels increasingly concerned about the future of these valleys for both the wildlife and people that live here. His parents were farmers and Pearson kept livestock himself but two years ago turned vegan due to concerns about the environmental impacts of livestock farming.</p> <p>\u201cClimate change is the big thing. We can\u2019t keep ignoring it. You look up at the overgrazed hillside from six feet of water and everything you can see is being propped up by government money. It\u2019s not sustainable. This prolonged flooding is starting to turn into an annual event \u2013 it was once in a lifetime, then once every decade and now it\u2019s all the time.\u201d</p> <p>Samantha Somers, environment manager at Natural England, says the organisation will continue to support natural flood management measures, including creating space for temporary ponds and restoring rivers.</p> <p>\u201cRecent flooding unfortunately caused significant distress and disruption for communities and businesses. However as flooding is a natural process, flood plains can generally continue to support ecosystems which are rich in wildlife and can accommodate floodwaters when rivers burst their banks,\u201d she says.</p> <p><em>Find more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-age-of-extinction\">age of extinction coverage here</a>, and follow biodiversity reporters <a href=\"https://twitter.com/phoeb0?lang=en\">Phoebe Weston</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pgreenfielduk?lang=en\">Patrick Greenfield</a> on Twitter for all the latest news and features</em></p>",
  "<p> In experiments, people perceive an approaching spider to be moving much faster than it really is, and faster than a ping-pong ball or other neutral object moving at the same speed. It is reasonable to deduce, then, that humans generally have an unconscious bias against spiders. Nothing too depressing about society follows from this. But the idea that we are prey to unconscious bias in more important areas \u2013 to do with decision-making, and how we treat our fellow bipeds \u2013 has in recent decades become a hot topic. It is at the root of what is called \u201cbehavioural science\u201d and \u201cnudge politics\u201d, which reports suggested were driving the British government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/uk-covid-19-strategy-questions-unanswered-coronavirus-outbreak\">laissez-faire early coronavirus strategy</a>. But how strong is the evidence that it exists?</p> <p>It was the field of behavioural economics, as described in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/13/thinking-fast-slow-daniel-kahneman\">Daniel Kahneman\u2019s bestseller </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/13/thinking-fast-slow-daniel-kahneman\">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a></em>, that demonstrated that humans do not make mathematically perfect decisions about probability; they instead rely on rough rules of thumb, and often go wrong. Some of these habits are uncontroversial, such as confirmation bias (you tend to notice only the evidence that confirms what you already believe). But the inference by the field that such biases mean \u2013 as Pragya Agarwal uncritically repeats here \u2013 that \u201chumans are not naturally rational\u201d is extremely dubious, especially since it depends heavily on which definition of rationality you use.</p> <p>For example, the finding that people care about the possible loss of some money more than they care about the possible win of the same amount is considered an irrational bias, because mathematically they are equal sides of the same bet. So trying harder to prevent the loss is called the bias of \u201closs aversion\u201d \u2013 at least among comfortably tenured academics. On the other hand, if you have very little money in the first place, it is perfectly rational to care very deeply about losing an amount that might ruin you, and it is sensible not to risk that for a 50/50 chance of winning.</p> <p>Agarwal, a data scientist who has worked on the dynamics of social interactions, also endorses some of the wilder claims of evolutionary psychologists in the area of rationality. My favourite among these is the crazy theory that, as she endorses it, \u201cour brains have evolved to reason adaptively rather than rationally or truthfully\u201d, which is the fashionable modern version of the Cretan liar paradox. If it\u2019s true, after all, then I have no reason to believe it is true.</p> <p>That\u2019s not to say that we are not prey to any failures of rationality at all, of course \u2013 a fact already conceded by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jonathanswift\">Jonathan Swift</a> when he sardonically modified <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/17/how-aristotle-is-the-perfect-happiness-guru\">Aristotle</a>\u2019s definition of man as the rational animal to man as \u201cthe animal capable of rationality\u201d. And Agarwal tells some colourfully persuasive stories about how such potential bugs in our mindware contribute to the degradation of our public sphere. The flipside of confirmation bias, she explains, is the less snappily named \u201cdisconfirmation bias\u201d, which is when we \u201cspend considerable energy in denigrating arguments that run counter to our existing beliefs\u201d. Remind you of any particular social media platform? \u201cOften when we are picking up our phones or tablets and browsing, we are doing so while waiting in a queue or having our coffee or pretending to be working, and so we skim, share and retweet quickly,\u201d she writes, almost as though she has had a crack surveillance team following me for years, and it is this very rapidity that makes biased responses more likely. Cleverly, Agarwal also notes an asymmetry in terms for the phenomenon whereby people on social media end up hearing only from people who think like themselves. I, an intellectual, lament the fact that I am in a \u201cfilter bubble\u201d, while you, a bigoted yahoo, live in an \u201cecho chamber\u201d.</p> <p>Evolutionary explanations must be part of the puzzle here, but it is often tempting to exceed their proper scope. Prejudice against people not like ourselves, for example, doubtless originated in early humans for perfectly good reasons. \u201cHumans appear to have a bias that members of out-groups or competitive tribes are less magnanimous and more dangerous than those who belong to our in-groups,\u201d Agarwal writes, which was fair enough on the savannah. But such explanations might imply that these biases are innate, so she also denies that they are \u201cnecessarily hardwired\u201d, and suggests they can be unlearned. This optimistic message, though, can sit in awkward tension with the simplistic neuro-determinism by which she claims that specific brain regions (such as the amygdala) or hormones (oxytocin) programme our responses.</p> <p>For issues of racial and other discrimination, do we really need the idea of \u201cunconscious\u201d bias at all? Someone scrawling Islamophobic graffiti on a wall is obviously quite conscious about it. Agarwal has chosen throughout to use the terms \u201cimplicit bias\u201d and \u201cunconscious bias\u201d interchangeably. The first is linked to a controversial psychological tool called the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/mar/07/implicit-association-test\">Implicit Association Test</a>, the arguments over which show the difficulty of proving the existence of something that is, ex hypothesi, unconscious and so unavailable to the subject\u2019s introspection. So the IAT uses reaction times as a proxy for the assumed bias: if a white person is slower by some number of milliseconds to associate a black face with a desirable social role, for example, then they are said to have an implicit bias against black people.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nearly a fifth of people in Britain who are stopped and asked to prove their immigration status are, in fact, British</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Despite doubts over particular methodologies, we can agree that there must be something to the idea that racist and sexist prejudice can operate below conscious awareness, and <em>Sway</em> succeeds impressively in its drive to show that justice is undermined by a rich array of social biases about age, gender, race, accent, and so forth. Unconscious bias is a plausible explanation for why so many <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/13/how-us-law-enforcement-is-failing-to-police-itself\">white American policemen</a>, even those who are not explicitly racist, end up shooting so many unarmed black men; why hurricanes given women\u2019s names (eg, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hurricane-katrina\">Katrina</a>) are perceived as less frightening than those with men\u2019s names; and why nearly a fifth of people in Britain who are stopped in the street and asked to prove their immigration status are, in fact, British. (Agarwal is appropriately scathing about the \u201cpost-racial\u201d claim that there is no racism in Britain any more: an idea, I have noticed but she is too polite to say, that tends to be most eagerly promoted by those who are, in fact, racists.) One can disagree with her presentation of the science, but Agarwal\u2019s diagnosis of the political harms of bias is passionate and urgent.</p> <p>What can we do about our own biases? The key is to pause, breathe, and realise that the spider is not really racing towards us so fast. Research on \u201cdebiasing\u201d has attracted scepticism from those invested in the \u201cnudge politics\u201d model \u2013 understandably, because for nudge politics to work, we must remain biased automata vulnerable to its paternalistic guidance. And yet many biases can be overcome if we are made aware of them, and incorporate a check for them into our slow, deliberative thinking. \u201cWe need time, intention and adequate cognitive capacity and resources to be aware of the activation of stereotypes,\u201d Agarwal writes hopefully, \u201cand then to significantly reduce the application of any stereotypical beliefs on others around us.\u201d Her own book can, perhaps, help readers do the same.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Sway is published by Bloomsbury (RRP \u00a316.99). </em></p>",

The death toll from the virus in the country passed 4,000 and is greater than that reported by China (3,309). California governor Gavin Newsom said on Monday that the number of Covid-19 hospitalisations in the state had nearly doubled over the past four days and the number of ICU patients tripled during that time.</p> <h2><strong>France, Spain, Russia and the UK record their highest daily deaths on Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>Tuesday was a deadly day across Europe, with the largest increases in the number of deaths from the coronavirus in a number of countries. UK deaths were up 381 from 1,408 on the previous 24 hours \u2013 representing a 27% day-on-day increase \u2013 by far the biggest the country has experienced.</p> <h2><strong>US Navy captain asks permission to isolate 4,000 crew members in Guam</strong></h2> <p>The captain of US Navy aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/captain-of-coronavirus-us-aircraft-carrier-4000-sailors-let-off-ship-die-theodore-roosevelt\">asking for permission</a> to isolate the bulk of his roughly 5,000 crew members onshore after several sailors became infected with Covid-19.

Iranians were busy with treating their own people, they won\u2019t give a damn for a sick Afghan.\u201d</p> <p>Eynoddin Aslami, head of the camp, said record numbers of Afghans had been arriving. \u201cFor a month there were more than 13,000 people crossing the border every day although that has decreased to around 3,000 a day.</p> <p>\u201cWe are all concerned here.

There\u2019s already a lockdown in Herat and around Kabul and Kandahar, and we\u2019re really concerned about the humanitarian impact. It\u2019s already challenging. The border on the Pakistan side is closed and we are expecting more measures.</p> <p>\u201cSupply lines are chocking up which is a real concern in a country on the brink of famine. On top of that there is the issue of the Taliban and other armed groups allowing access in areas that are not accessible, which underlines the talk there has been around a [global] corona ceasefire.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this month Joel Millman, of the International Organization for Migration, which has been tracking the returns from Iran, warned of the danger of widespread transiting via unofficial border crossings.</p> <p>\u201cThis is particularly dangerous in a public health emergency, because \u2026 no one is able to check your health conditions or your documents, or know where you\u2019re coming from.\u201d<br></p>",

That\u2019s what happened.</p> \n  <p><strong>Governor Cuomo: </strong>You\u2019ve always been good at manipulation. You\u2019ve always been the meatball of the family.

now, we\u2019re starting to see glimmers that [social distancing] is actually having some dampening effect,\u201d Fauci told CNN.</p> \n  <p>Fauci\u2019s comments come as officials in the San

they are seeing fewer coronavirus cases than expected two weeks after ordering residents to stay home.</p> \n  <p>But Fauci added that he is skeptical about some potential treatments for coronavirus, such as the anti-malaria drug chloroquine, which <strong>Trump </strong>has said could be a \u201cgame changer\u201d in the fight against the virus. </p> \n  <p>\u201cYou have to hearken back to the

Bartering is back. In your letterbox are flyers from your actual neighbours. They are introducing themselves and offering to do your food shopping or pick up prescriptions for you. Community libraries are being set up in boxes along suburban streets. There are signs offering seedlings in exchange for cuttings. All along your road your neighbours are planting vegetables.</p> <p>In the sky there are few planes and hardly any cars on the road. Trains and buses are almost empty \u2013 and if you try to sit next to someone, people look really scared and angry and move seats.</p> <p>In the tradition of plain dressed religious groups, people\u2019s hair has also changed. Everyone looks as if they cut their hair at home into bowl cuts, with blunt scissors. Those with coloured hair have stopped maintaining it. They have grey temples, white streaks or skunk stripes down their parts. Men are growing long beards.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just the haircuts \u2013 it\u2019s the faces.</p> <p>People, particularly in the more affluent areas, look different: more wrinkled, their faces slacker and less filled out. It\u2019s as if this new sect banned Botox and fillers.</p> <p>Then there are the clothes. In the supermarket queue (hey, did this new sect ban toilet paper and pasta because there\u2019s like none on the shelves?) people stand spaced far apart, looking morose. Everyone is dressed in stained tracksuits, baggy-arsed yoga pants or bedtime wear. Their faces are doughy and pale, their bodies heavier as if they were eating a lot. No one bothers with makeup anymore or perfume. Many people seemed to be either medicated or hungover.</p> <p>The person coming out of the silent retreat might also presume that the sect that\u2019s taken over society has a strict moral code (as well as an appalling dress code).</p> <p>Adulterous affairs the world over have suddenly stopped.

The hotels have turned into quarantine stations and illicit couples concerned about being busted via contact tracing (which happened to Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s character in Contagion) have put their affairs on ice.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/27/we-crossed-over-this-week-coronavirus-is-heaping-cruelty-upon-cruelty\">We crossed over this week: coronavirus is heaping cruelty upon cruelty | Brigid Delaney</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Say you\u2019re not having an affair, but you feel like a bit of casual sex or at least a snog.

Checking your Instagram feed, there\u2019s loads of inspirational quotes, videos of people making sourdough bread, others of people planting herb gardens. No one seems to be going out. You feel an absence of Fomo.</p> <p>And the government itself has radically and rapidly pivoted \u2013 from free-market, neoliberal, conservatives to socialists.</p> <p>Under a conservative government, unemployment benefits have doubled.
