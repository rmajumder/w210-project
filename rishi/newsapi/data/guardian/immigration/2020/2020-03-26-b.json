  "<p>Advocates for American workers praised a \u201chistoric\u201d increase in unemployment benefits included in an emergency $2tn relief package <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/senate-passes-coronavirus-stimulus-package\">approved by the US Senate</a>, which will offer special \u201cpandemic unemployment\u201d to gig workers, self-employed workers, and some people forced to leave their jobs because of the coronavirus crisis.</p> \n<p>But although the unemployment payments will offer months of support to many vulnerable Americans, advocates said that the bill threatens to leave too many people out. Even $2tn in emergency aid, experts said, is probably too little for the size of the crisis.</p> \n<p>As part of the unprecedented relief package approved by the Senate on Wednesday night, millions of Americans would get an individual, $1,200 check to help them weather the economic crisis caused by the pandemic. The bill would also create a $500bn lending program for businesses, cities and states and a $367bn fund for small businesses, which would focus on helping small businesses to pay their employees\u2019 salaries through the next weeks of pandemic-related shutdowns, rather than laying them off.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/us-coronavirus-stimulus-all-you-need-to-know\">US coronavirus stimulus checks: are you eligible and how much will you get?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The bill\u2019s major benefit to American workers is not that single cash payment, but the sweeping expansion of unemployment benefits<strong>, </strong>labor experts said.<strong> </strong>The bill offers laid-off workers an additional $600 a week for four months and extends unemployment benefits to gig workers, independent contractors, and others who have not previously been eligible for unemployment, including people forced to leave their jobs to care for family members with coronavirus, or to care for children whose schools have closed.</p> \n<p>Despite some flaws, the emergency bill offers \u201cthe largest expansion of unemployment benefits in history\u201d, Senator Bernie Sanders, a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, said on Wednesday night before the bill\u2019s passage. About $250bn in federal funds would go to expanding these benefits, Sanders said.</p> \n<p>For many workers, the $600 added to their weekly state unemployment checks would mean that the checks would come close to matching their original salaries, labor experts said, and the measure would increase most unemployment payments to around the median weekly income of <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/wkyeng.pdf\">$936</a>.</p> \n<p>A worker who files for unemployment in New York, for example, would typically get just $435 a week. Under the new emergency relief bill, that amount would increase to $1,035 a week, said Andrew Stettner, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, a progressive thinktank. This was a \u201cmajor boost of benefits\u201d, he said, and would ensure that most workers filing for unemployment during the pandemic \u201cdon\u2019t experience an economic catastrophe\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThese are, by historic standards, probably the most generous unemployment benefits we\u2019ve given,\u201d said Michael Madowitz, an economist at the Center for American Progress, a leading liberal thinktank.</p> \n<p>So generous, in fact, that a<strong> </strong>small group of Republican senators made a last-minute effort to try to change the benefits Wednesday night, arguing that the bill as written would temporarily give some laid-off workers benefits larger than their pay on the job.</p> \n<p>Senators Lindsey Graham, Ben Sasse, and Tim Scott called this a \u201cstrong incentive for employees to be laid off rather than going to work\u201d.</p> \n<p>Sanders lambasted his Republican colleagues for trying to reduce unemployment benefits, an attempt which failed in the senate late Wednesday night.</p> \n<p>During \u201can unprecedented economic crisis\u201d, Sanders said, \u201cthey\u2019re very upset that someone who is making $10, $12 an hour might end up with a paycheck for four months more than they received last week.</p> \n<p>\u201cHow absurd and wrong is that?\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"cadefc22-6bff-4cf8-adce-c413778f0d4b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qCyyfquAJgU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The boost in unemployment insurance comes as<strong> </strong>the US labor department announced that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/26/us-unemployment-rate-coronavirus-business\">3.3 million</a> Americans filed unemployment claims last week, the largest number the department had ever recorded.

In California alone, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/25/california-coronavirus-unemployment-newsom\">more than a million </a>people filed unemployment claims in recent weeks.</p> \n<p>The relief bill offers other lifelines to workers, including $367bn to help small businesses cover their employees\u2019 salaries and keep afloat. An estimated <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/cares-act-senate-coronavirus-bill-economic-relief-plan/\">94% of Americans who file taxes</a> will also get the one-time emergency payment: $1,200 for most individuals, $2,400 for couples, plus $500 per child in the household, with the payments reduced or eliminated for people at higher income levels.</p> \n<p>Most Americans will be able to receive these emergency payments through direct deposit in their bank accounts, and the payments will go out \u201cwithin three weeks\u201d, the US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said on Wednesday.</p> \n<h2><strong>Many </strong><strong>could be left out</strong></h2> \n<p>Experts said that allowing self-employed and gig workers to receive unemployment checks was a crucial step forward, since these workers make up growing portion of the national workforce and have not previously been eligible for federal unemployment insurance.</p> \n<p>But the emergency relief bill still threatens to leave many people out, they said, including domestic workers paid in cash, undocumented workers, homeless Americans, people who do not have bank accounts, and some people who have not filed taxes recently.</p> \n<p>Even people who are eligible for unemployment may face delays in actually getting their checks. State unemployment systems have been overwhelmed by an unprecedented number of applicants. New York\u2019s online unemployment application website reportedly crashed multiple times this week. So did Oregon\u2019s.</p> \n<p>In addition, people who do not have direct deposit accounts on file, or who have moved since last filing their taxes, may face delays in getting their emergency payments. Some Americans who have not filed taxes recently may be entirely left out. The <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/16rpsaeztabulations.pdf\">Internal Revenue Service estimates</a> that about 30 to 40 million American adults, or about 15% of the population, do not file tax returns, Garrett Watson, an analyst at the conservative Tax Foundation, said.</p> \n<p>Some experts said there was also a more fundamental problem: even though the senate\u2019s $2tn coronavirus package is being hailed as the largest emergency relief bill in American history, it may still not be enough to match the scale of the problem.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-us-economy-health-lives-trump\">The economy v our lives?

  "<p>The conversion of the ExCel centre into a field hospital with 4,000 beds is perhaps the most ambitious medical project Britain has seen since the end of the second world war.</p> \n<p>It will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/25/nhs-nightingale-video-shows-scale-of-london-coronavirus-hospital-excel\">dwarf all other hospitals</a> in the UK. The largest in the country, until NHS Nightingale opens next week, is St George\u2019s in Tooting, with around 1,300 beds.</p> \n<p>Even for military planners, used to operating hospitals under fire or in extreme environments like deserts, the scale is unusual.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/excel_centre_locator/giv-3902S0r39O8f4zTN/\" data-alt=\"Locator map\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/excel_centre_locator/giv-3902S0r39O8f4zTN/\">Locator map</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Britain\u2019s field hospitals, deployed to conflicts or disaster zones, operate as units of 50, 100 or 200 beds. These can be joined together, but it would take 20 of the largest units to match the capacity of the new coronavirus centre.</p> \n<p>Yet in under two weeks, the two kilometre-long halls \u2013 usually filled with people planning their future, or marketing their products \u2013 will instead be wards, ready to receive an expected surge in coronavirus patients. The exhibition halls make an ideal space for a temporary hospital, and are relatively simple for military engineers to adapt. They have a history of rapid and flexible conversions, including commandeering a cruise ship, the SS Uganda, during the Falklands war and turning it into a hospital ship.</p> \n<p>And if the scale of the Nightingale is unusual, at least it comes without many of the usual challenges of setting up field hospitals \u2013 providing power and sanitation under tents, in areas without electricity or running water.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"44034f72-51bf-4b34-8fc9-e3ecd5a3bf62\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hiXVdfOSlF8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cA space like the ExCel centre is ideal, large, with built-in power, sanitation, lighting, all of that stuff you need to go,\u201d said Maj Gen Tim Cross, who commanded a logistics brigade building refugee camps in Kosovo, and later set up a medical brigade.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn the field, all of those things have to be put in play by engineers. There is also access by road, rail, sea and air.\u201d Nearby City airport has closed to commercial flights, and offered its terminals and runway to the government.</p> \n<p>The only major long-term challenge for engineers may be heating the large halls if the weather turns cold again, Cross added.</p> \n<p>A video from an engineer working on the project, underlining the scale of the engineering needed to set it up, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/25/worker-posts-video-from-excel-centre-being-converted-into-coronavirus-hospital\">has gone viral</a>. But the two-week timeline may also be needed to source equipment for the hospital, which will need everything from beds and bandages to a temporary mortuary to handle the dead.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.avensysmedical.co.uk/\">Avensys</a>, a company that resells medical equipment and trains engineers in how to use it, said that supplies of key items including ventilators, beds, oxygen concentrators and infusion pumps are \u201cdrying up\u201d nationwide.</p> \n<p>They also confirmed the wards at the Nightingale will include ventilators because they have been asked to train engineers to maintain them.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got people who know how to fix a syringe pump but maybe don\u2019t know how to fix a ventilator. The training will be on site,\u201d said Dan Sullivan, marketing manager for the company. \u201cIt will cover defibrillation, ventilation, monitoring of equipment.\u201d</p> \n<p>Once the centre is set up, daily logistical challenges will include feeding thousands of people \u2013 patients and medical staff \u2013 and providing laundry services to the wards. Medics, drawn from both the military and the ranks of the NHS, are reportedly expected to live at the site, while working for at least six-week deployments.</p> \n<p>The military has both catering teams and mobile \u201cbath and laundry\u201d units that could help, but the government may want to try to use commercial firms, particularly as the hospitality sector has been so badly hit by the crisis.</p> \n<p>Despite the vast scale of NHS Nightingale, there are also backup plans for two more field hospitals in exhibition centres in Birmingham and Manchester if infections and hospitalisations continue to grow.</p> \n<p>To military officials who are used to preparing for the worst \u2013 and hoping it never comes \u2013 this extraordinary scale of preparation makes sense. \u201cThe biggest field hospital I\u2019ve seen is a couple of 200-bed units together,\u201d said Cross, \u201cbut this number of beds is sensible planning [for the current crisis].\u201d</p>",

As PA Media reports, in an email to staff, the inventor said his eponymous company designed the \u201cCoVent\u201d at the request of Boris Johnson, and promised to donate 5,000 to the international relief effort. Dyson said teams of engineers had been working solidly on the design since receiving the call from PM 10 days ago, and the UK government had placed an initial order of 10,000 units. He added: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have received an initial order of 10,000 units from the UK government, which we will supply on an open-book basis.</p> \n   <p>We are also looking at ways of making it available internationally.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The company is now waiting for the design to receive regulatory approval so manufacturing can commence.</p> \n  <p>Created in partnership with Cambridge-based science engineering firm TTP, the new ventilator had to be safe, effective, efficient in conserving oxygen and portable, Dyson said. It also had to be bed-mounted, easy to use and not require a fixed air supply. The battery-powered machine has been designed for use in different settings, including field hospitals and when patients are being transported, PA reports.</p> \n  <p>In his email Dyson went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The core challenge was how to design and deliver a new, sophisticated medical product in volume and in an extremely short space of time.

  "<p>Neanderthals made extensive use of coastal environments, munching on fish, crabs and mussels, researchers have found, in the latest study to reveal similarities between modern humans and our big-browed cousins.</p> <p>Until now, many Neanderthal sites had shown only small-scale use of marine resources; for example, scattered shells. But now archaeologists have excavated a cave on the coast of Portugal and discovered a huge, structured deposit of remains, including from mussels and limpets, dating to between 106,000 and 86,000 years ago.</p> <p>Researchers say the discovery shows that Neanderthals systematically collected seafood: in some layers the density of shells was as high as 370kg per cubic metre. They say this is exciting because the use of marine resources on such a scale and in such a way had previously been thought to be a trait of anatomically modern humans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea943fef667ec5f941a45f4ee1f302dd064ed2ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea943fef667ec5f941a45f4ee1f302dd064ed2ea/0_817_3325_1996/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The cave on the coast of Portugal that was found to contain evidence of Neanderthals\u2019 use of food from the sea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cave on the coast of Portugal that was found to contain evidence of Neanderthals\u2019 use of food from the sea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zilhao et al./Science</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Prof Jo\u00e3o Zilh\u00e3o, of the University of Barcelona, a co-author of the report, said the discovery added to a growing body of research suggesting modern humans and Neanderthals were very similar.</p> <p>\u201cI feel myself uncomfortable with the comparison between Neanderthals and Homo sapiens, because the bottom line is Neanderthals were Homo sapiens too,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only was there extensive interbreeding, and such interbreeding was the norm and not the exception, but also in every single aspect of cognition and behaviour for which we have archaeological evidence, Neanderthals pass the sapiens test with outstanding marks.\u201d</p> <p>The findings chime with recent evidence that Neanderthals had <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0220464\">\u201csurfers\u2019 ear\u201d</a> and may have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/15/neanderthals-dived-for-shells-to-make-tools-research-suggests\">dived to collect shells for use as tools</a>. Previous finds in Spain have shown they decorated seashells and were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/feb/22/neanderthals-not-humans-were-first-artists-on-earth-experts-claim\">producing rock art</a> 65,000 years ago.</p> <p>\u201cForget about this Hollywood-like image of the Neanderthal as this half-naked primitive that roamed the steppe tundra of northern Europe hunting for mammoths and other megafauna with poor and inefficient weapons,\u201d said Zilh\u00e3o. \u201cThe real Neanderthal is the Neanderthal who is in southern Europe.\u201d</p> <p>The discovery appears to throws cold water on the idea that the marine-rich diet of modern humans, high in fatty acids, helped them to outcompete Neanderthals as a result of better cognition.</p> <p>\u201cIf [marine foods] were important to modern humans, then they were important for Neanderthals as well \u2013 or perhaps they did not have the importance people have been attributing to them,\u201d said Zilh\u00e3o, noting that in any case few modern humans were living by the coast.</p> <p><a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aaz7943\">Writing in the journal Science</a>, researchers reveal how the newly excavated site, which was about 2km or less from the coast when occupied by Neanderthals, contained a plethora of stone tools, roasted plant matter and remains from horses and deer, as well as from eels, sharks, seals, crabs and waterfowl, suggesting a diverse diet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"655db9479a309d1409c40432408bd77b06ec9267\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/655db9479a309d1409c40432408bd77b06ec9267/0_268_3321_1993/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shells found in the cave, the largest of which is 5cm across.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shells found in the cave, the largest of which is 5cm across.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zilhao et al./Science</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Zilh\u00e3o said the find also shed some light on Neanderthal fishing practices, noting that they must have had baskets or bags. \u201cYou cannot walk 2,000m with a catch of 10 or 20 kilos of shells in your hands,\u201d he said, adding that the Neanderthal population also probably understood that shellfish collected at the wrong time could be toxic.</p> <p>The team say the dearth of other huge shell deposits in Europe could be down to a lack of preservation: shellfish could not be transported far from the coast, and hence many such deposits in northern Europe would have been destroyed as polar ice caps advanced, while elsewhere they may have been submerged as the sea rose to today\u2019s levels.</p> <p>The stretch of Portuguese coast where the new find was made is perhaps the only location locally where such deposits could have been preserved, they say. South Africa, by contrast, experienced an uplift of the land, meaning many such deposits have been preserved.</p> <p>Dr Matthew Pope, a Neanderthal researcher at the UCL Institute of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/archaeology\">Archaeology</a> who was not involved in the study, said its findings were significant.</p> <p>\u201cWe have increasingly recognised the sophistication of Neanderthal behaviour, but one thing that continued to mark out the behavioural evolution of modern humans in Africa was the appearance of systematic collection of marine resources, and this marked a difference between the two populations,\u201d he said. \u201cEvidence like this is important in showing Neanderthal populations had the capability for systematic exploitation of marine resources.\u201d</p>",

Nonetheless, business cashflows will be severely affected in a way that, without support measures, would threaten material numbers of businesses failing, and large and persistent rises in unemployment.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bankofengland/status/1243146123742715904\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">At its meeting ending on 25 March 2020, the MPC voted unanimously to maintain <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BankRate?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BankRate</a> at 0.1%. <a href=\"https://t.co/w7Stn3J1VZ\">https://t.co/w7Stn3J1VZ</a></p>&mdash; Bank of England (@bankofengland) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bankofengland/status/1243146123742715904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 26, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e7c99968f08af215f6fb9ea\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jillian-ambrose\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-26T12:03:43.376Z\">12.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Oil glut to deepen as North Sea maintenance is postponed</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb793a853fedf851da5d66bcbdfe754291805c91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb793a853fedf851da5d66bcbdfe754291805c91/0_0_4407_2938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Johan Sverdrup oil field in the North Sea west of Stavanger, Norway.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Johan Sverdrup oil field in the North Sea west of Stavanger, Norway.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carina Johansen/NTB Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The coronavirus is dealing a body blow to global oil demand forecasts - and in the North Sea it is playing a role in growing the market\u2019s crippling oversupply too. </strong><br> Ineos has announced plans to postpone its summer maintenance on the North Sea\u2019s most important oil pipeline to help reduce the need for staff to work together during national efforts to stem the spread of covid-19.</p> <p><strong>This is good for safeguarding workers, but bad for an oversupplied oil market as it means rigs will keep operating. <br></strong> <br>Rystad Energy expects the delay to allow an extra 330,000 barrels a day to flow from North Sea projects this summer.

In other words, only buyers able to put down a 40% deposit will qualify for a loan.</p> <p>It is understood the lender\u2019s mortgage department is currently flooded with requests for mortgage payment holidays, while its valuers are also unable to inspect properties.</p> <p>In the note to brokers, Halifax said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cOur priority remains the wellbeing of our colleagues and customers and we\u2019re closely monitoring the developing situation and continue to follow official guidelines.</p> <p>\u201cThis has had a direct impact on our available processing resource and we have therefore withdrawn new mortgage and remortgage products across our residential range with a loan to value ratio of over 60%.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>It added that transfers and advances on existing loans will remain unchanged.</p> <p>Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said there are two reasons for the move: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a funding crisis - the banks are awash with liquidity.</p> <p>\u201cThere are two main issues. The first is a processing one - they are not all set up for staff to work from home. The big processing centres are closed and they are operating with a skeleton staff.</p> <p>\u201cThere is also the issue with valuations. A lot of the big lenders will accept desktop valuations but only to a certain loan-to-value. As they can\u2019t get a valuer out to inspect the property, it is very difficult to process a mortgage application for a higher LTV.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Mortgage brokers said Halifax\u2019s decision to halt much of its lending is the most serious since the credit crunch.</p> <p>Andrew Montlake, managing director of broker Coreco explained: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe Halifax\u2019s decision to stop lending above 60% LTV reflects the wholesale recalibration of risk that is unfolding in the mortgage market.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Other lenders are likely to follow Halifax. HSBC said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThere are no current plans to change our mortgage lending approach at this stage, though clearly we will have to monitor service levels in these unprecedented times.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Part of the reason for Halifax\u2019s decision is that its staff are dealing with an unprecedented flood of requests for mortgage holidays.</strong></p> <p>Harris added: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cLenders are throwing all their resources into dealing with payment holiday requests. In the same way that people are buying food they don\u2019t need, people are asking for payment holidays when they don\u2019t need them.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A small firm called Inspiration Healthcare has received a \u00a34m order from the NHS for which it will import hundreds of the devices \u2013 used to keep patients with respiratory problems breathing \u2013 from the US and Israel.</p> \n<p>Late on Thursday, the government said it would also join an EU scheme to procure ventilators, having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/no-10-boris-johnson-accused-of-putting-brexit-over-breathing-in-covid-19-ventilator-row\">initially said it would not take part</a> because it had missed an invitation to do so owing to a \u201ccommunication problem\u201d.</p> \n<p>A Westminster source said it made sense for the government to pursue multiple strategies in parallel to mitigate the risk of any one option failing.</p> \n<p>The firms involved are waiting for the government to go public with its plans but the delay in announcing them is not thought to be holding up the production effort.</p> \n<p>Dyson has revealed the most detail about its progress, including pictures of its CoVent prototype.

The players are understood to be receptive to a reduction in salary and discussions are continuing but, in consultation with the players\u2019 union the AFE, they rejected the first proposal.</p> <p>The intention is for any measures to apply equally to every athlete at the club, from the men\u2019s and women\u2019s football teams to the B team and the under-19s to those who play basketball, handball, futsal and roller hockey.

  "<p>In a way I\u2019m glad that Kim Kardashian has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/24/kim-kardashian-west-accuses-taylor-swift-of-lying-over-leaked-tape-kanye\">reignited a four-year-old feud with Taylor Swift</a> based on an 11-year-old feud with Taylor Swift that was all started by Kanye West, a man who has hardly been involved in it since about 2017. In a way, that\u2019s good.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard not to [<em>gestures at current reality</em>] be constantly thinking about, you know, rather more pressing matters. The cleanliness of door handles, for example. The intensity of other people\u2019s coughs, or how far to veer away from each other on the pavements while out on your government-mandated walk. Whether you have enough food in the cupboards to last two weeks. Whether daytime TV will ever go back to normal. How deeply we can possibly scrape the bottom of the Netflix barrel. How desperate for entertainment we will have to be to plunge ourselves into going on YouTube and watching a vlog. Right now, these are my worries. It\u2019s nice of Kim Kardashian to try to distract me with something totally and utterly facile and pointless at a time of global crisis.</p> <p>On the other hand, come on. To help you catch up, this all truly started <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/sep/14/kanye-west-taylor-swift-vmas\">at the VMAs in 2009</a>, when Swift was 20 and Kardashian was three years away from even dating Kanye, in fact was still at the \u201cCarl\u2019s Jr advert and a guest appearance at WrestleMania\u201d level of fame. In 2016, Kanye released the song Famous, featuring the eternally controversial lyric: \u201cI feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why? I made that bitch famous.\u201d Swift rightly took exception to having her career as one of the most successful singer-songwriters in global history getting reduced down to \u201cthat bitch\u201d.</p> <p>At which point Kardashian \u2013 now an ascendent, royalty-level celebrity, married in a palace \u2013 released a Snapchat video of Kanye on the phone to Swift before the song was even recorded, openly discussing the lyrical content. The intimation was: Swift knew about the lyric, she fully had the heads up, she can\u2019t be mad at being called \u201cthat bitch\u201d in one of the biggest songs of 2016, and by being in any way upset at being called \u201cthat bitch\u201d she is somehow Playing The Game. This is the natural starting point of our feud.</p> <p>I have gone through some changing feelings about Swift over the years, because I don\u2019t really like her music \u2013 which is a fine and normal opinion to have. But something about the hugeness of Swift, and her ubiquity, makes \u201cnot really liking the sounds she makes\u201d become something close to political. Here\u2019s a rough Marmite analogy for you. Swift is the semi-popular yeast spread Marmite, in that if you love her, you love her with an intensity that blocks out the sun; if you don\u2019t, she leaves you utterly cold. But because her songs constantly loop on the A-list of society, you cannot escape Marmite, and now you\u2019re starting to really get rubbed up the wrong way by Marmite.</p> <p>Every Friday afternoon, all the people in the office take control of the shared kitchen and make you eat a slice of bread and Marmite. At every wedding you are at, there is a tangible point in the evening when everyone, fuzzy drunk and joyful, kicks their shoes off and loudly heaps an entire spoon of Marmite into your mouth. Every time you tell someone you don\u2019t like Marmite, they bore on at you for ages about how much umami her new album adds to stews and bologneses. At this point, you cannot avoid Marmite, because every advert is for Marmite and every time Marmite releases a new jar, every headline is about Marmite, and how Marmite \u201cdid that\u201d. Despite not even liking Marmite, you somehow know about Marmite\u2019s thing with Tom Hiddleston where he wore that vest.</p> <p>And now your feelings about Marmite aren\u2019t about Marmite any more. They are fixed towards the celebratory Marmite culture that has been built around it, one you are constantly on the outside of, looking in. </p> <p>Anyway, this week the full and explicit 25-minute video of Kanye\u2019s call to Taylor in 2016 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/24/kim-kardashian-west-accuses-taylor-swift-of-lying-over-leaked-tape-kanye\">got leaked</a>. It went a fair way to vindicating Swift and making it clear she was unprepared to be called \u201cthat bitch\u201d in the song. And Swift reacted to the leak <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PopCrave/status/1242206240618446850\">by posting</a> on Instagram: \u201cInstead of answering those who are asking how I feel about the video footage that leaked, proving that I was telling the truth the whole time about *that call* (you know, the one that was illegally recorded, that <em>somebody</em> edited and manipulated in order to frame me and put me, my family, and fans through hell for 4 years) \u2026 SWIPE up to see what really matters.\u201d And she added a link to various charity organisations supporting those on low income in the whole global pandemic thing. Kardashian responded by going on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KimKardashian/status/1242299582136098821\">a Twitter rant</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s actually quite fascinating how badly Kardashian has played this one, because normally the dynasty is so good at upselling bad news in a way that just makes them richer and more adored. In the past few years they have managed to turn secret pregnancies, cheating scandals, Kanye\u2019s personal debt and the Kendall Jenner Pepsi advert into major PR wins. Each time, Kardashian somehow comes out of each one more regal and elegant and more on the cover of Vogue. </p> <p>But her feud with Swift has been a bum note from the off. What is it that Swift has been doing wrong, again? Being slightly too earnest in a hard-edged industry that clomps her around like a pair of shoes in a tumble dryer? Being gracefully tight-lipped in the face of years of provocation? Linking to a charity organisation on Instagram? Not liking being called a bitch? At this point, whatever your feelings about Marmite, it\u2019s really hard not to take its side in the face of relentless attempts by Nutella to reignite a feud with it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2e62ee2d03d431b021a58f5a5c1f8044db91e9b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e62ee2d03d431b021a58f5a5c1f8044db91e9b0/591_67_1229_1786/688.jpg\" alt=\"Britney Spears\" width=\"688\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Comrade Britney rocks a revolutionary-red off-the-shoulder number</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>We\u2019ll meet you on the barricades, Britney!</h2> <p>A word on Comrade Britney, now, to whose revolution I offer humbly my hands and heart. While Kim Kardashian has been holed up in a Calabasas mansion going on about arguments that happened an entire World Cup cycle ago, Britney Spears has been a sunbeam of support to her fans throughout this pandemic, offering aid to those who are struggling and reaching out to her via DM. And, in really quite an unexpected zig, she has amplified an artist\u2019s call for a general strike and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/25/comrade-britney-spears-star-calls-for-strike-and-wealth-redistribution\">redistribution of wealth in the US</a>. All right, Britney, let\u2019s \u2026 all right man. Let\u2019s do this. Drag them out by their hair.</p> <p>On Instagram, Britney <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-FppKxAFxm/?utm_source=ig_embed\">shared</a> a quote from the writer Mimi Zhu, saying: \u201cDuring this time of isolation, we need connection now more than ever [\u2026] We will learn to kiss and hold each other through the waves of the web. We will feed each other, redistribute wealth, strike. We will understand our own importance from the places we must stay. Communion moves beyond walls. We can still be together.\u201d</p> <p>Personally, I\u2019m a little unsure how much of that Britney actually meant. Over the course of her long career, she has only touched on politics once or twice, endorsing the Iraq war, being registered in Louisiana as a Republican (in 2001) and, in 2017, encouraging her followers to support the Dream Act, which would have offered legal status to undocumented immigrants who went to school in the US. So, \u201ca mixed bag\u201d. But then, in a nice font and on an orange background, and talking so charmingly about reaching out to friends and family \u2026 it does sort of look like a generically wholesome Instagram quote, if you squint and look at it.</p> <p>Like \u2026 you really have to read down to see the bit about taking the wealth and striking hard. I still back her pivot to communism to the hilt. And who among us hasn\u2019t accidentally called for a revolution by sharing a meme they liked on Instagram? If she comes out of this with a Vegas show that calls for us to bring society crumbling down and rebuild it again from the rubble up, cool. And if she doesn\u2019t? That is also OK. Stay safe, Britney Spears. Stay golden.</p>",
  "<p>World Rugby is drawing up an action plan to ensure leading unions do not go to the wall as the financial impact of coronavirus starts to bite. The governing body is examining the books of all tier one nations, pledging to quickly help the most needy and prioritising the Test calendar which generates the bulk of the sport\u2019s revenue.</p> <p>The Rugby Football Union said this week that it expected to lose up to \u00a350m in the next financial year, Australia will be down \u00a345m if the shutdown continues for the rest of 2020, New Zealand would face a shortfall of \u00a360m, Wales\u2019s loss will be far greater than budgeted for and all the unions have imposed, or are considering, pay cuts. They have all opened up their books for inspection so the extent of the downturn may be gauged. Talks with tier two countries will follow.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/26/rugby-wales-survive-mass-shutdown\">The Breakdown | Rugby in Wales has survived mass shutdown before and will again</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A virtual meeting of World Rugby\u2019s executive committee and professional game committee, which includes representatives from all the major unions, was held on Monday. It agreed that the executive should deliver an action plan as soon as possible. The profit from last year\u2019s World Cup is expected to be \u00a3165m, giving the governing body the means to offer financial support, although no union is in immediate danger of collapsing.</p> <p>The first task is to draw up contingency plans for this year\u2019s two Test windows, in the southern hemisphere in July and Europe in November. Wales are scheduled to play Japan on 27 June and during the following three weekends New Zealand, Australia, South Africa and Argentina all host Six Nations sides, while Italy have matches against the United States and Canada and the Springboks have a fixture against Georgia in Port Elizabeth.</p> <p>\u201cWe are intensively examining scenario planning for the July internationals,\u201d said the World Rugby chairman, Bill Beaumont. \u201cWe will be working in full partnership with key stakeholders to explore potential appropriate actions.</p> <p>\u201cOnly by working in full partnership with our unions, the professional leagues and international players will we be able to deliver a solution that will reduce the impact of this extraordinary challenge.\u201d</p> <p>It is unlikely to be before the end of next month that World Rugby knows how many, if any, of the tours will go ahead as individual governments will decide on whether visiting teams will be allowed in. Two contingency plans are being considered, the first of which would see the tours postponed until August.</p> <p>The second would alter the nature of the November internationals. Under the current schedule, host unions take all the money generated by a Test, unless it is a fourth international. If there are no matches in the south this summer but Europe enjoyed a full programme, it would ordinarily mean a significant revenue imbalance but World Rugby is looking at a way of sharing the proceeds.</p> <p>One option would be for the teams from the southern hemisphere to host a couple of matches and there is a willingness of the various unions, club organisations and players associations to work together. The RFU and the French Rugby Federation allow only World Rugby to speak directly to their professional clubs over player welfare problems, but that has been lifted to ensure Premiership Rugby and Ligue Nationale de Rugby are part of the dialogue.</p> <p>While Test rugby will be the priority on resumption, the club matches that will recommence first will be those where no cross-border travel is involved which gives French and English clubs a better chance of completing their leagues than the Pro14.</p> <p>Last year, the Six Nations <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/19/world-rugby-nations-championship-rugby-union\" title=\"\">failed to unanimously support World Rugby\u2019s proposal for a nations league</a> that would have been worth \u00a36bn over 12 years and provided insulation in the current crisis. The European Unions turned instead to the private equity company CVC with which they remain in talks over a 15% stake for \u00a3300m, money that would now absorb losses rather than be used for investment.</p>",
  "<p>A meat-eating dinosaur with a feathered body, iron grip and a tail for agile pursuit of prey, has been discovered by fossil hunters, revealing that raptor dinosaurs were thriving right up to the point the asteroid struck, 66m years ago.</p> <p>The remains, comprising about 20 bones, were found in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico, in rocks dating to about 67m years ago. They are believed to be from a type of dromaeosaurid \u2013 a family of theropod dinosaurs that includes raptors \u2013 which appears to have been a close cousin of the velociraptor.</p> <p>Dubbed <em>Dineobellator notohesperus \u2013</em> a nod to the indigenous people of the region, the Navajo, the latin word for warrior and the south-western US location it was found in \u2013 the animal would have been about two metres in length, weighed about 18-22kg, and been covered in feathers.</p> <p>Researchers say the fossils show a number of unusual features. \u201cThe upper arm bone has a very distinct angle in it, and basically what that means is that muscles attaching there would have been more efficient than other [dromaeosaurids],\u201d said Dr Steven Jasinski, of the University of Pennsylvania and a co-author of the research.</p> <p>\u201c[That] would have allowed muscles of a similar size to be stronger and do more work more quickly in this animal.\u201d</p> <p>The animal\u2019s claws also showed large projections on their bottom side, where muscles and tendons would have attached. \u201cThey are especially large, which would have given this animal a really strong grip and ability to grasp things with both its hands and feet,\u201d said Jasinski. </p> <p>And while many dromaeosaurids had stiff, reinforced tails that acted as a counterbalance, helping the animals run fast while low to the ground, the newly discovered beast had an extra feature: mobility.</p> <p>\u201cThe one major thing that is different about Dineobellator is that at the base of the tail, the vertebrae are set up differently so it makes the tail highly mobile at the base,\u201d said Jasinski. That, he added, means the dinosaur would have been able to whip its stiff tail around while pursing zig-zagging prey, meaning it was not only a nippy predator, but agile to boot. </p> <p>While the final moments of Dineobellator are lost to time, the team found a gouge in one of the animal\u2019s claws that appears to have been made around the time of its death \u2013 suggesting the beast may have met a sticky end. \u201cWe speculate an altercation with another Dineobellator or other predatory theropod resulted in these marks,\u201d they write.</p> <p>Jasinksi noted that while dromaeosaurids were present in both Asia and North America about 125m years ago, there are few fossils from the period that followed, with more recent remains discovered primarily in Asia.</p> <p>\u201cIt looks like the ancestors of Dineobellator would have basically migrated from Asia and then diversified once they got back to North America at the very end of the Cretaceous, right before they went extinct,\u201d said Jasinski.</p> <p>Jasinski said the findings emphasised there was still considerable diversity before the mass extinction, despite some arguing that dinosaurs were in decline. \u201cIt shows dromeosaurids were still basically evolving, they were still trying out new evolutionary pathways, new features, up to the very end,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Dr Stephen Brusatte, a palaeontologist at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the research, agreed, adding that Dineobellator is the best fossil raptor dinosaur from southern North America during the very end of the age of dinosaurs, and one of the last surviving raptors.</p> <p>\u201cIn fact, it seems like there were many types of raptors in North America at this time, so they were really prospering,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The creature would have been fearsome, he added. \u201cIf you saw it alive, Dineobellator would have looked like a weird, long-tailed, toothy bird \u2013 but one that could chase you down on foot and gut you with its claws.\u201d</p>",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe news that we could be trapped here for three months is devastating,\u201d said Alex Foulkes, 31, a freelance film-maker from Wrexham. \u201cIt feels like being in prison.

  "<h2>25. Larry Crowne (2011)</h2> <p>Yikes. This was one of the Hankster\u2019s two directorial credits and it is a dull and lifeless autumn-years romcom, with Hanks playing opposite Julia Roberts, who is every bit as uneasy as the man himself.</p> <h2>24. Elvis Has Left the Building (2004)</h2> <p>Hanks has a cameo as a dead Elvis Presley impersonator here; ironic, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/tom-hanks-coronavirus-actor-and-wife-rita-wilson-test-positive-in-australia\">he got Covid-19 while on location in Australia filming Baz Luhmann\u2019s Elvis biopic</a>, in which he was due to play Presley\u2019s manager, Colonel Tom Parker.</p> <h2>23. The Da Vinci Code (2006) / Angels &amp; Demons (2009)</h2> <p>Hanks is the dashing Harvard symbologist Dr Robert Langdon, who deciphers occult signs in Renaissance artworks about Jesus in these clunky adaptations of the bestsellers by Dan Brown (whose books had specified that the hero resembled Harrison Ford).</p> <h2>22. The \u2019Burbs (1989)</h2> <p>A nosy suburbanite obsessed with his neighbours\u2019 supposed dirty dealings? That\u2019s the role here with which Hanks does his best. Maybe it would have worked better if he was the straightahead good guy whose innocent pastimes were misinterpreted.</p> <h2>21. Road to Perdition (2002)</h2> <p>A darker role for Hanks; notable, although it doesn\u2019t really play to his strengths. He plays a mob hitman in 1930s Chicago who, with his small son in tow, is going to track down the guys who killed most of his family. A high-minded oddity on his CV.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"166c278246beebb078b241004a42eb87afe082ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/166c278246beebb078b241004a42eb87afe082ef/433_0_3071_1844/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aaron Eckhart and Tom Hanks in Sully.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aaron Eckhart and Tom Hanks in Sully.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Warner Bros.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>20. Sully (2016)</h2> <p>Clint Eastwood directed Hanks in this true-life hagiopic about the heroic airline pilot Chesley \u201cSully\u201d Sullenberger III who, with staggering coolness under pressure, landed his damaged US Airways Flight 1549 on New York\u2019s Hudson river and got all 155 passengers and crew off unscathed, only later to suffer an investigation from the contemptible pen-pushers and corporate bean-counters. Not a bad role for Hanks, but it doesn\u2019t quite come to life.</p> <h2>19. Catch Me If You Can (2002)</h2> <p>Hanks is the cool counterweight to a young Leonardo DiCaprio here; he plays the stolid, even-tempered FBI man on the trail of DiCaprio\u2019s notorious teenage conman in this stranger-than-fiction true story. While DiCaprio fakes being a lawyer or an airline pilot, Hanks is the authentic authority figure, who seems to have a sneaking admiration for DiCaprio\u2019s ingenious illegal hi-jinks.</p> <h2>18. Turner &amp; Hooch (1989)</h2> <p>Playing opposite a big adorable dog is something only an adorable actor can do. Hanks plays a cop called Turner, who has to take care of a big, sloppy lovable dog called Hooch who is the only witness to his owner\u2019s murder. There is joint relatability and some inter-species chemistry, it has to be admitted, and this film played an important part in establishing Hanks\u2019s brand identity.</p> <h2>17. Charlie Wilson\u2019s War (2007)</h2> <p>Again, it is weird here to see Hanks play someone who is not the good guy. He is playing something of a cynical slimeball in this true-life political drama from the screenwriter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/aaron-sorkin\">Aaron Sorkin</a> and the director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/nov/20/mike-nichols\">Mike Nichols</a>. Hanks is the 80s Reagan-era congressman Wilson who masterminded the covert war against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. He brings natural charisma and presence, but the part-sentimental-part-cynical vibe feels wrong.</p> <h2>16. The Terminal (2004)</h2> <p>Hanks is not like Meryl Streep: accents are not his thing. But here he is giving us an outrageous Ryussh-yun ick-syent as a wacky innocent from a fictional ex-Soviet state who has to live hobo-ishly in New York\u2019s JFK airport terminal building when a coup back home renders him stateless. Stanley Tucci plays the flustered immigration officer who has to deal with him. As so often in Hanks\u2019s CV, his mojo would work better as the kindly authority figure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cbde80e360b9d53045aedf687b261bd002c86b26\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbde80e360b9d53045aedf687b261bd002c86b26/0_61_2649_1589/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Hanks in Cast Away.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Hanks in Cast Away.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cinetext Bildarchiv/Allstar/DreamWorks</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>15. Cast Away (2000)</h2> <p>Robert Zemeckis\u2019s film, with Hanks as the FedEx employee who is marooned on a desert island, is taken very seriously by Hanks fans; the initial \u201ccrash\u201d scene is certainly a corker, and Hanks is also a likable castaway with his tattered trousers and straggly beard, capering with self-congratulatory delight when he makes fire for the first time. But there is something a bit silly about this; with anyone less seductive than Hanks, it would have sunk.</p> <h2>14. Saving Mr Banks (2014)</h2> <p>In his senior years, Hanks has a new mastery of playing iconic real-life figures who are part of the US\u2019s pop-cultural landscape. Here he is playing Walt Disney; really, no other casting was possible. He is the kindly, persistent movie impresario persuading Emma Thompson\u2019s cantankerous author PL Travers into letting him do a film version of her creation Mary Poppins. As ever, Hanks is a genius at embodying pure likability and his Disney has to be a nice guy (there is no question of mentioning the <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2013/12/walt-disney-anti-semitism-racism-sexism-frozen-head.html\">darker sides</a> to Disney\u2019s personality). In fact, most people will assume that Disney was naturally like Tom Hanks.</p> <h2>13. Sleepless in Seattle (1993) / You\u2019ve Got Mail (1998)</h2> <p>Maybe it is wrong to bracket these together, at least partly because Sleepless in Seattle is appreciably better: lighter of touch, lighter in heart. In SiS, Hanks is still in his big-haired younger-man mode, but by YGM, he is older with smaller hair. But, of course, it is still very much Hanks in each case conducting a poignantly/hilariously long-range relationship with Meg Ryan and jointly becoming the nation\u2019s sweethearts. They work well together, without a doubt.</p> <h2>12. The Post (2017)</h2> <p> Hanks is an actor born to work with Steven Spielberg; in many ways, he is the actorly embodiment of what Spielberg is as a director, and he gives a richly entertaining and watchable performance as the renowned Washington Post editor and liberal lion <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/22/ben-bradlee-washington-post-alan-rusbridger\">Ben Bradlee</a>, sparring amiably with his boss Kay Graham (Streep) as they chase the Pentagon Papers scoop in 1971, which paved the way for the paper\u2019s Watergate investigation. In this role, Hanks delivers pure Jimmy Stewart decency straight into your veins.</p> <h2>11. Splash (1984)</h2> <p>A great early role for the boyish and unthreateningly cherubic Hanks, who at the time was considered by some pundits insufficiently like a leading man. He is the single guy who falls for the mermaid who saves him from drowning and who comes to Manhattan to get wet and reveal her true nature in his bathtub \u2013 although the film adroitly swims around the potential for smut. Darryl Hannah is terrific in this (and there is a Hollywood sexism story to be told in the list of Hanks\u2019s female leads whose careers have faded while his has motored ever onward). Hanks first sneakily gained cinemagoers\u2019 love in this film, as the boy-next-door who is the man-next-door.</p> <h2>10. Philadephia (1993)</h2> <p>A key moment in Hanks\u2019s early-90s golden age, winning an Oscar in this courtroom drama for playing a gay man who contracts HIV and sues his employer for wrongful dismissal. In some ways, the film conforms to the \u201cliberal balancing\u201d template by pairing Hanks with Denzel Washington as his personal-injury lawyer who is a soon-to-be-reformed homophobe, and there is a new debate now about straight actors playing gay. But nothing could have signalled empathy and respect more clearly than casting Hanks. It is a Hollywood \u201cissue\u201d movie, yes, with the self-consciousness that this implies; but Hanks brings intelligence and sensitivity.</p> <h2>9. Captain Phillips (2013)</h2> <p>You do not expect to see Tom Hanks in an action movie, but that is what\u2019s happening in this gripping hijack thriller from the director Paul Greengrass, based on a true story. Hanks plays the merchant navy captain in charge of a colossal container ship as it sails round the Horn of Africa, a great big slow-moving easy target for Somali pirates with semi-automatic rifles, motivated by poverty. Hanks gives a great performance as the authority figure under stress; the good guy who, like everyone else, is at the mercy of the vast globalised forces of capital.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e63665bcf41b7bbb10de084390138aeeaf507360\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e63665bcf41b7bbb10de084390138aeeaf507360/0_45_2555_1533/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Loggia and Tom Hanks in Big.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Loggia and Tom Hanks in Big.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/20th C Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>8.<strong> </strong>Big (1988)</h2> <p>This fantasy comedy, directed by Penny Marshall and written by Gary Ross and Anne Spielberg (sister of Steven), features Hanks in his \u00fcber-Hanks role, the breakout part that really did put him on the map. It is a role that speaks to everyone who feels in their heart that they are impostors, deeply implausible as adults and basically bewildered (or excited) little kids. Hanks plays Josh Baskin, the boy who resents the rules laid down for kids, wishes to be big and then \u2026 well \u2026 be careful what you wish for. Like no one else, Hanks could persuasively embody an adult with adult presence who is nonetheless someone with a child\u2019s innocence and fun. (Try to imagine Tom Cruise doing it, and you realise how quickly it could be a scary movie.) It is never better demonstrated than in the giant toy piano scene, with Hanks joyously dancing on the keys.</p> <h2>7.<strong> </strong>Saving Private Ryan (1998)</h2> <p>Another great Spielberg-Hanks pairing, with Hanks rising to the challenge of a big movie on a big subject. He is the everyman hero Captain Miller in the second world war after D-day who leads a platoon whose purpose is to find Private Ryan (Matt Damon) on the field of battle and order him home on compassionate grounds, because all his brothers have been killed. Importantly, Miller is not a professional soldier, but a teacher in civilian life, someone who feels the burden of leadership keenly, but with great modesty and seriousness: a matter of civic values rather than macho heroism. He also has to try concealing that he has a tremor in his hand. The paradox of Hanks is that he is pure Hollywood star quality mixed with self-effacement and it works very well in a drama where the huge impacts of warfare distract you from the acting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3c19ed403739f50e780da4ba3f1f419c2bac75d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3c19ed403739f50e780da4ba3f1f419c2bac75d/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Hanks in Bridge of Spies\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Hanks in Bridge of Spies.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/DreamWorks</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>6. Bridge of Spies (2015)</h2> <p>One of the very few Hanks movies in his later period in which he goes toe-to-toe with an actor of equal heavyweight stature \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/05/bridge-of-spies-film-review-tom-hanks-steven-spielberg-cold-war-gary-powers-u2\">the result</a> is a balanced double act, rather than a Hanks leading turn. Mark Rylance plays the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel in early 60s America, whom the US government was about to hand over to the Russians in a spy-swap at the Glienicke bridge linking east and west Berlin, the \u201cbridge of spies\u201d. This hair-raisingly dangerously manoeuvre is planned by Abel\u2019s modest but courageous lawyer James Donovan, played of course by Hanks; a man whose amateur enthusiasm and impulsiveness marks him out as a non-diplomat, but someone who nonetheless gets things done. Hanks\u2019s Donovan is superb: homely, wily and sweet, an inspired straight man to the deadpan humour of Rylance\u2019s spy. \u201cAren\u2019t you worried?\u201d Hanks asks Rylance, who comes back with: \u201cWould it help?\u201d</p> <h2>5. A League of Their Own (1992)</h2> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no crying in baseball!\u201d Hanks delivers a classic axiom in this Penny Marshall gem, about the foundation of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League during the second world war. He is the grumpy former baseball star who hit the skids due to booze, and is now given his comeback chance by managing what he derisively thinks is an absurd novelty: a female baseball team, featuring Geena Davis, Rosie O\u2019Donnell and Madonna. It\u2019s when he yells at right-fielder Evelyn Gardner (played by Bitty Schram) for screwing up that she begins to cry, and he lets her have it with that iconic line. Perhaps this is the one and only time that Hanks fully inhabits an unsympathetic role, and that is probably only because we know it\u2019s just temporary, and that he is basically a father/brother figure, subordinate to the women and bound to be redeemed by them.</p> <h2>4. A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood (2019)</h2> <p>If Hanks has a late-period masterpiece, it is his extraordinary work in this film about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/23/everyone-said-dont-ruin-my-childhood-director-marielle-heller-on-how-her-mr-rogers-film-finally-got-made\">the real-life US children\u2019s TV presenter Fred Rogers</a> in the late-90s, when he was sliding out of fashion and a little derided by the media establishment. However, he succeeds in profoundly impressing a cynical hardbitten magazine journalist (played by Matthew Rhys) who has come to interview him. This is a genuinely complex, difficult-to-read performance from Hanks, who creates an amazingly detailed, eccentric collection of physical and vocal mannerisms based on the real Rogers, quite different from the aw-shucks routine that people might more readily associate with him. It is especially amazing when he asks Rhys to remain absolutely silent with him over lunch in a restaurant for a solid minute so that they can reflect on the people important to them.</p> <h2>3.<strong> </strong>Forrest Gump (1994)</h2> <p>Look upon the colossal importance of Forrest Gump in Hanks\u2019s career and in 90s Hollywood generally, ye mighty arbiters of taste, and despair! If not despair, exactly, then sadly concede the massive showbusiness firepower that Hanks brought to this folksy parable of \u2026 what exactly? Robert Zemeckis (second only to Marshall and Spielberg as a Hanks director) shot this Zelig-ish, or John Irving-ish story of a young man growing up in the 50s with learning difficulties (as no one then phrased it) and a low IQ, whose essential innocence, niceness and luck cause him to rise to greatness, with a college football career, distinguished service in Vietnam, mastery of table-tennis, a thriving shrimp-fishing business and then brilliance in stock-market investment \u2013 and he becomes a national celebrity for running across the whole country. It is the walk and halting voice that nail it (he was to modify it a little bit, arguably, for his performance in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood). Forrest Gump was made in Bill Clinton\u2019s 90s, but Gump is pure Reagan: the simple patriot who wins through.</p> <h2>2. Toy Story (1995) / Toy Story 2 (1999) / Toy Story 3 (2010) / Toy Story 4 (2019)</h2> <p>The pure essence of Hanks is distilled for his inspired vocal role as Woody in Pixar\u2019s glorious animated Toy Story movies. He voices the pull-string cowboy figure who is the favourite toy of Andy, but in danger of being supplanted in his affections by astronaut Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen), just as westerns were supplanted by space-race-inspired sci-fi in America\u2019s heart generally. Hanks\u2019s vocal work in these movies is a total joy, and it is one of the most heartwarming, heartrending pieces of casting in Hanks\u2019s career. It also puts him under pressure as an actor in a way few of his other films have, especially in TS2, when his old toy comrades tell him to forget about being the favourite of fickle kids and instead embrace being the pampered possession of adult collectors, because children will only break your heart. There is greatness in this.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d83fcc47ef64c84671f3372c69e3ca80e28a3500\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d83fcc47ef64c84671f3372c69e3ca80e28a3500/0_94_2094_2095/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Hanks as Jim Lovell in Apollo 13.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Hanks as Jim Lovell in Apollo 13.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Universal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>1. Apollo 13 (1995)</h2> <p>Something very, very wrong has happened and the whole world holds its breath. The Nasa moon missions, which the US and every other country had come to take for granted as an untarnished, ongoing success, look like becoming a terrible catastrophe. In 1970, the Apollo 13 spacecraft suffers an onboard explosion on its way to the moon, depriving it of most of its electric power and oxygen. There is every chance its astronauts will die, in real time, on national television. Who can save them and all of us? Who can pluck a pyrrhic victory from this defeat?</p> <p>The answer of course is the solid, dependably heroic Hanks, playing Apollo 13\u2019s modest commander Jim Lovell, on whose memoir this movie is based. It is directed with a sure hand by Ron Howard, creating a wonderfully well-made, suspenseful, exciting, poignant Hollywood classic. Hanks is an actor who has something Nasa-ish in his own professionalism, a guy who has refined and fortified his technique over a long period of time and just gets on with it. Cleverly, it is the calm and unshowy Hanks who negotiates the loss of innocence involved in all this: the Apollo 13 near-miss was the event that showed that the US was not all-powerful and also caused the country to begin losing interest in moon landings.</p> <p>Importantly, Hanks leads the operation that brings Apollo 13 and its pilots back, unharmed, and brings our idealism back to Earth as battered but also unharmed. This was a heroic adventure, given an added piquancy by the fact that they didn\u2019t get what they wanted. And Hanks embodies all of this: tough, resourceful, a leader, a pragmatist and a modest hero.</p> <blockquote> </blockquote>",
  "<p>It is 29 years since the release of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/pearljam\">Pearl Jam</a>\u2019s 16m-selling debut album Ten. On one level: of course it is. Is there anything more piquantly redolent of the distant moment when grunge went from being a witty melding of US punk, old-fashioned British indie and an unabashed love of 1970s hard rock to a vast, mainstream concern than the videos for its singles <a href=\"https://youtu.be/MS91knuzoOA\">Jeremy</a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/qM0zINtulhM\">Alive</a>? These were expensively shot depictions of, respectively, high-school alienation \u2013 replete with hand-scrawled words such as \u201cdisturb\u201d, \u201cnumb\u201d and \u201cproblem\u201d flashing across the screen \u2013 and Pearl Jam in their early live pomp, a riot of backwards caps, pained expressions and plaid.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a0946c95720520bed6ded19cef44c80cb14644c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0946c95720520bed6ded19cef44c80cb14644c1/0_0_3000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pearl Jam: Gigaton album art work\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pearl Jam: Gigaton album art work</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But on another level: <em>really?</em> Grunge bands that took the major-label shilling were supposed to self-immolate in a blaze of hard drugs, discord and self-hatred. But three decades and 28 albums later, Pearl Jam are still here, still unequivocally huge. By the mid-2000s, Rolling Stone had started comparing them to the Grateful Dead, and the point holds: they\u2019re purveyors of implausibly long live shows and implausibly numerous live albums, possessed of a following so large and dedicated that it\u2019s impervious to fashion.</p> <p>It\u2019s a situation to which there are two obvious responses: the fans aren\u2019t going anywhere, so why try? And: the fans aren\u2019t going anywhere, so do what you want. The non-partisan observer might suggest that the former has been very much the ethos behind their least inspired albums; Gigaton, however, largely falls into the latter category. There are definitely points that sound exactly like someone who bailed after their last multi-platinum mega-seller, 1994\u2019s Vitalogy, might expect Pearl Jam to sound in middle age: Take the Long Way is workmanlike heartlands hard rock; Comes Then Goes is standard-issue gruffly wounded acoustic balladry that borrows its verse melody from Creedence Clearwater Revival\u2019s Up Around the Bend. Its use of electronics occasionally devolves into behold-this-moment-of-great-portent swirling befitting an album that features a Dark Side of the Moon-esque cardiogram over a painting of a collapsing polar ice shelf.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjeRrJljrHs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GjeRrJljrHs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Elsewhere, Gigaton sounds more vital and unexpected. In the six years since their last studio album, a lot has happened in US politics and it\u2019s tempting to suggest that might have something to do with it. Always good at rabble-rousing and nothing if not politically committed, you get the feeling that a certain urgency about getting their message across might have given Pearl Jam\u2019s music a renewed sense of vigour. The burst of widdly-woo guitar shredding on Superblood Wolfmoon is precisely the kind of thing that would have caused <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kurt-cobain\">Kurt Cobain</a> to roll his eyes, but the track comes at you with such force that it\u2019s irresistible. The pump organ of closer River Cross recalls sometime Pearl Jam collaborator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/neilyoung\">Neil Young</a>\u2019s use of the same instrument, but its wheezing, hymnal quality is a perfect backdrop for Eddie Vedder\u2019s impassioned vocal: punctuated by bass guitar and thundering drums, it keeps threatening to surge into lighters-out territory, but never takes the leap, as if to underline that the song\u2019s message of optimism is cautious at best. Quick Escape does a lot of Pearl Jammy stuff \u2013 big soaring chorus, more guitar histrionics \u2013 but sets them against an atmosphere that\u2019s authentically spacey and strange, as again befits lyrics that have taken on an entirely unwitting kind of currency. If you\u2019re going to release a song about the human race facing such catastrophe that escaping to another planet feels appealing, now is probably the moment to do it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/0EewHRl3pc0R5pBxTAexVm\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/0EewHRl3pc0R5pBxTAexVm\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  <p>The same impulse seems to have fuelled a desire to make music that reaches beyond the diehards. Dance of the Clairvoyants pitches angular post-punk guitar against limber electro-pop. Moreover, it does it really well. Never Destination stirs a small but nevertheless noticeable dash of impassioned soul influence into its punky stew, and Buckle Up is appealingly warm, off-kilter psychedelia with another lyric about uncertain futures: \u201cDo no harm,\u201d it counsels, \u201cand buckle up.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/mar/06/sign-up-for-the-sleeve-notes-email\">Sign up for the Sleeve Notes email: music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As for the rabble-rousing message, it\u2019s more potent and engaging than you might expect. You don\u2019t have to be a Breitbart subscriber to feel a little deflated by the prospect of another album telling you Donald Trump is an arsehole: unless your tastes in American rock tend to Ted Nugent and Kid Rock, it\u2019s a point you\u2019ve heard umpteen times. It says something about Pearl Jam\u2019s renewed dynamism that they\u2019ve found original ways of putting it. The humans departing earth on Quick Escape wearily complain about \u201cthe lengths we had to go \u2026 to find someplace Trump hadn\u2019t fucked up yet\u201d. Seven O\u2019Clock\u2019s gag about Trump as an indigenous American leader, \u201cSitting Bullshit\u201d, is pretty good: the way the lyric slips from poking fun to a haunting fantasy of him as a wounded, depleted force, \u201cthrowing punches with nothing to hit\u201d even better. Almost 30 years into a career you would once have put money on ending within five, Gigaton suggests Pearl Jam might still be around long after Trump is a distant memory.</p> <h2>This week Alexis listened to</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://youtu.be/R4KnPtf57n8\">International Teachers of Pop</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://youtu.be/R4KnPtf57n8\">: Don\u2019t Diss the Disco</a></strong><br>From their forthcoming second album, a gleaming, joyous nugget that fully justifies the band\u2019s name.</p>",
  "<p>Egyptian authorities have forced a Guardian journalist to leave the country after she reported on a scientific study that said Egypt was likely to have many more coronavirus cases than have been officially confirmed.</p> <p>Ruth Michaelson, who has lived in and reported from Egypt since 2014, was advised last week by western diplomats that the country\u2019s security services wanted her to leave immediately after her press accreditation was revoked and she was asked to attend a meeting with authorities about her visa status.</p> <p>On Sunday 15 March, Michaelson had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/egypt-rate-coronavirus-cases-higher-than-figures-suggest\">reported on research</a> by infectious disease specialists from the University of Toronto as well as public health data and news stories that pointed to Egypt having a higher rate of coronavirus cases than the number confirmed by the government.</p> <p>She cited a study accepted for publication in the Lancet Infectious Diseases journal, which had analysed flight records, traveller data and infection rates to estimate that Egypt could have had 19,310 coronavirus cases by early March, with the lower end of the range about 6,000 cases. The Egyptian government\u2019s official count at the time period covered by the data was that three people were infected.</p> <p>The day after the story was published, Michaelson was called to a three-and-a-half hour meeting with officials including the chairman of the state information service (SIS), Diaa Rashwan, where she says she and another journalist who had tweeted about the research were accused of misreporting an unreliable study and spreading panic.</p> <p>The Egyptian officials demanded the story be retracted or that the Guardian publish an official apology.</p> <p>On 17 March, Michaelson\u2019s press accreditation was revoked. The Guardian offered the Egyptian authorities the chance to write a letter for publication rebutting its report or the Canadian study, but received no response to the offer.</p> <p>The following day, British diplomatic officials and the SIS passed on the message to Michaelson that she needed to meet Egypt\u2019s visa issuance authority.</p> <p>Michaelson, who is also a German citizen, said she was advised by German diplomatic officials in Cairo that she should not attend the meeting under any circumstances. \u201cThey said, \u2018We do not believe it\u2019s safe for you to go to this meeting. You\u2019re at high risk of arrest and you should get on a plane,\u2019\u201d she said.</p> <p>Flights out of Egypt were due to be suspended at noon the following day, Thursday, and with so many foreign tourists trying to flee the country as travel bans kicked in around the world, most planes were fully booked.</p> <p>Michaelson said she was advised by the British embassy and her own contacts that members of the country\u2019s security apparatus were seeking to immediately remove her from the country. \u201cThe national security agency told British diplomats that there was a plane one evening and they \u2018wanted me on it\u2019,\u201d she said.</p> <p>A lawyer who attended the meeting with the visa issuance authority on Michaelson\u2019s behalf was given the same message, she added.</p> <p>She left Egypt on a flight ferrying stranded tourists and foreign nationals to Germany on Friday evening.</p> <p>Michaelson\u2019s departure leaves the north African country with no full-time British newspaper correspondents. Bel Trew, a correspondent for the Times, was threatened with a military trial and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/23/bel-trew-egypt-british-journalist-expelled-the-times\">expelled from Egypt</a> in March 2018.</p> <p>\u201cThe Guardian is a global news organisation that strives to report with clarity and integrity at all times,\u201d a spokesperson for the Guardian said. \u201cIn this instance we reported on scientific findings by credible infectious disease experts. We have offered the Egyptian government opportunity to comment and respond to our reporting in the normal way.</p> <p>\u201cWe regret that the Egyptian authorities have chosen to revoke accreditation from a reporter working for a trusted, independent media organisation like the Guardian.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Foreign Office said: \u201cThe UK supports media freedom around the world. We have urged Egypt to guarantee freedom of expression. UK ministers have raised this case with the Egyptian authorities.\u201d</p> <p>Asked for comment, an Egyptian official directed the Guardian to a letter sent last week by the SIS to the newspaper\u2019s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner.<strong> </strong>It argued the University of Toronto research cited in Michaelson\u2019s story relied on speculation, and that its approach and results had been rejected by the World Health Organization (WHO).</p> <p>In fact, the WHO said it was unable to verify the methodology used in the study, and said its own data was drawn from hospitals, meaning there was often a reporting delay. \u201cIt is possible that there are many other cases with mild symptoms which did not result in hospital visits, and therefore are not detected or reported,\u201d a WHO official told reporters in Cairo.</p> <p>Egypt had 366 confirmed cases of the virus by Monday with 19 deaths, according to the country\u2019s health ministry.</p> <p>Press freedom in Egypt has severely deteriorated since the military took power in 2013 and the former commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, became president the following year.</p> <p>The Committee to Protect Journalists said in <a href=\"https://cpj.org/reports/2019/12/journalists-jailed-china-turkey-saudi-arabia-egypt.php\">its annual report last year</a> that 26 reporters were detained in the country and that most had been prosecuted in groups on charges of terrorism and reporting false news.</p> <p>Domestic media has gradually come to be dominated by the state, which exercises widespread censorship.

  "<p>For the past year and a half, local county census committees and homeless service providers throughout California have been conducting their own outreach for the 2020 census, knowing that only an accurate count of the state\u2019s growing homeless population will guarantee the federal funding needed to get people off the streets and into stability.</p> <p>Because even before the US coronavirus crisis prompted shelter-in-place orders and the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/us/virus-census-homeless.html\">suspension of 2020 </a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/us/virus-census-homeless.html\">census field operations</a> nationwide, casting doubt on the operations for the once-in-a-decade count, they were preparing for the federal Census Bureau to significantly undercount the homeless population.</p> <p>While homelessness has soared, particularly in California, census staffers said plans in place to count the population were insufficient and disorganized. The federal bureau had limited the hours of targeted counting to between midnight and 7am. There was little or varied communication around cultural facilitation led by service providers or homeless representatives who act as a guide for enumerators, to smooth the process. Two weeks from 1 April, census day, when thousands of enumerators were set to flood the streets to conduct the count, some field offices were still not fully staffed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/if-i-get-it-i-die-homeless-residents-say-inhumane-shelter-conditions-will-spread-coronavirus\">'If I get it, I die': homeless residents say inhumane shelter conditions will spread coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In yet another sign of the disarray, a script sent out to some field offices in February directed enumerators to ask people about their citizenship status, despite a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/27/census-citizenship-ruling-supreme-court-trump-question-verdict-2020\">supreme </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/27/census-citizenship-ruling-supreme-court-trump-question-verdict-2020\">court ruling rejecting </a>the federal government\u2019s reasoning for the question.</p> <p>\u201cForget Covid-19,\u201d said a Los Angeles-based regional census manager who asked to only be identified as Maria. \u201cIt was going to be a dramatic undercount already.\u201d</p> <p>With the additional stress and uncertainty of the coronavirus crisis, the homeless community on the move in attempts to stay safe, and local county census workers unable to do their own outreach, a vulnerable population stands to suffer from an even more broken process.

California\u2019s unhoused population made up more than a quarter of the nation\u2019s total count of 568,000.</p> <p>With no fixed address and little trust in the government, the homeless population has always been notoriously difficult to track. \u201cIt\u2019s a population that\u2019s very leery of the government,\u201d said Candice Elder, the founder and executive director of the not-for-profit East Oakland Collective.</p> <p>Community advocates throughout the state knew that now, more than ever, with the population growing, the Census Bureau needed to get an accurate count of California\u2019s unhoused.

On Census Day, the plan was to conduct the targeted non-sheltered outdoor location counting, going to the encampments and talking to people on the streets directly.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s clear that this administration is not trying to count everyone in the US</p> <footer> <cite>Robert Clinton</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Communication continually broke down between the federal bureau and the San Francisco census committee, Clinton said, whether over verifying service sites, clarifying cultural sensitivity training or just going over how enumerators would count and collect information from each location. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult because the people who work in San Francisco, the Census Bureau staff on the ground here, they have really good intentions,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cBut it\u2019s clear that this administration is not trying to count everyone in the US.\u201d</p> <p>The federal Census Bureau did not respond to requests for comment.</p> <p>In November, a group of advocates in Alameda county, some serving on the county\u2019s complete count committee, sent a letter to the area manager of the Los Angeles regional office, which oversees California, Hawaii, Alaska, Nevada, Oregon, Washington and Idaho.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6df9472fb2b662f668c0539d3a2056cb59a300c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6df9472fb2b662f668c0539d3a2056cb59a300c0/0_0_1125_1491/755.jpg\" alt=\"A script sent out to some field offices in February directed enumerators to ask people about their citizenship status.\" width=\"755\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A script sent out to some field offices in February directed enumerators to ask people about their citizenship status.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maria, census regional manager</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe have shared the operational plans provided by the US Census Bureau with the homeless service providers and advocates in our community,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cThey have expressed significant concern.

It\u2019s going to be a radical undercount.\u201d</p> <p>The citizenship question in the script the bureau sent out to some field offices would only further alienate the homeless population, Elder said. \u201cYou have a lot of undocumented unhoused residents who may not complete the census out of fear of being reported to immigration,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to reassure people, and tell them that the census is not going to be reported to law enforcement.\u201d</p> <p>A 10 February email from the Los Angeles regional office moved to correct the inclusion of the citizenship question \u2013 \u201cSome offices received scripts that ask the citizenship question; this is not part of the decennial census and must be removed/crossed-out from all materials immediately\u201d \u2013 but Maria worried that some enumerators may have already received the scripts before the issue could be fixed.</p> <h2>The coronavirus crisis strikes</h2> <p>On top of the already existing confusion and uncertainty around the homeless count, comes the coronavirus crisis \u2013 the shelter-in-place orders, and the warnings of social distancing.</p> <p>Census workers at the local and national level are concerned about how the crisis will affect an already flawed operation.</p> <p>\u201cTrying to do a fixed point enumeration at a time of mass migration of where people live just seems insane, on top of what was already foundationally going to be a massive, massive challenge,\u201d Maria said.</p> <p>She described the situation as frantic. \u201cThese are not the kind of operations where you can just wing it, and we have no guidance on how we plan on enumerating these people,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThe household stuff is going to be counted no matter what,\u201d Maria continued. \u201cBut even if we delay this two weeks, there\u2019s no way we\u2019re going to be able to get an accurate count of the people who are struggling on a lower rung.\u201d</p> <p>Local census workers who planned to ignore the mismanagement on the federal level and help homeless people fill out the census on their own now find themselves increasingly hampered by safety concerns.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"80995f2330e4c8cb51c07a5df3689294aaa6f395\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80995f2330e4c8cb51c07a5df3689294aaa6f395/0_182_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mobile shower service for the homeless in Los Angeles.

and could thus stay open.</p> <p>In Connecticut, Democratic senator and gun-control advocate Richard Blumenthal argued that closing gun stores would be broadly in line with other anti-coronavirus measures, including restrictions on travel and assembly.</p> <p>\u201cPlain and simple, there is no reason why gun stores should be given this exemption,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenBlumenthal/status/1242459711485722633\">the senator tweeted</a>.</p> <p>But the stores stayed open and the National Rifle Association praised the state governor, Ned

opposing the gun shop shutdown.</p> <p>State justice David Wecht said the governor\u2019s initial order to close gun shops amounted to \u201can absolute and indefinite prohibition upon the acquisition of firearms by the citizens of this commonwealth \u2013 a result in clear tension with the second amendment\u201d of the US constitution as well as the constitution of Pennsylvania itself.</p> <p>Wolf\u2019s office did not announce the policy change: it was included on an updated list of businesses subject to an order to close because they are deemed \u201cnon-life-sustaining\u201d.</p>

  "<p>We all have that one show we turn to when we have scrolled through all of Netflix and found nothing else, when we need a brief window of distraction from life\u2019s stresses, or if we want a nostalgic reminder of another, simpler time.</p> <p>Now, in lockdown and with bags of time on our hands, it seems like the perfect moment to revisit those box sets and indulge in hours of rewatching, away from the ever-present tyranny of choice.</p> <p>We asked 10 writers to take us through their rewatches of choice, from the gripping drama (and culinary delights) of The Sopranos, to the fast-paced political intrigue of The West Wing, the romantic trials of New Girl and Gossip Girl, as well as the niche fascinations of Law and Order: SVU. Or, if you would rather not live in the TV screen of the past, one writer argues to stick with the endless stream of the new.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d6659f31384bc634eb46250f425d6796089db2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d6659f31384bc634eb46250f425d6796089db2e/0_163_3258_1955/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Sopranos\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taking care of business \u2026 The Sopranos.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The Sopranos</h2> <p>If the past is a foreign country, rewatching The Sopranos is like stepping into another universe entirely. The silken polo shirts and rattling gold bracelets, the flip-phones and leather-seated Sedans, the strippers and \u2013 above all \u2013 the sandwiches; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/david-chase\">David Chase</a>\u2019s late-90s epic on mobsters reckoning with their consciences is endlessly rewatchable. So much so that I am about to embark on my third viewing of the six-season, 86-episode odyssey of James Gandolfini\u2019s masterful Tony Soprano and the enduring chaos of his New Jersey family of mafiosos. While I might dip in and out of Friends for a comfort-rewatch, or turn to Bob\u2019s Burgers for an easy laugh, it is almost impossible to watch single episodes of The Sopranos; it is too granular and endlessly gripping. A tentative look back at a pivotal scene soon finds you four hours in, forgetting what happens next.</p> <p>And there are myriad narratives to follow: the evolution of Anthony Junior from chubby-cheeked tween to emotionally devastated young adult; Meadow\u2019s journey from daddy\u2019s girl to fierce independence; Uncle Junior\u2019s entire aesthetic; Livia\u2019s decrepitude; and Carmella\u2019s relationship rollercoaster, from loyalty to defiance to begrudging acceptance. Of course, holding it all together are the fantastic performances by Gandolfini \u2013 whose weight gain over the seasons starts to make his heavy breathing its own marker of dramatic foreboding \u2013 and Lorraine Bracco who plays his increasingly conflicted therapist Jennifer Melfi. Their therapy sessions are a masterclass in zippy dialogue and unspoken emotion, as close as we can get to riveting conversation in this time of social isolation.</p> <p>The show ultimately manages to strike that ineffable balance between escapism and emotional realism, lending it endless depth and rewatch potential. If nothing else, the food is worthy of a repeat view: pepper-stuffed sandwiches, cannelloni, heart-busting ice-cream sundaes; mouth-watering culinary inspiration for your quarantine. <strong>Ammar Kalia</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"269b5a5a1670064bed19061f883d6278fbae603f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/269b5a5a1670064bed19061f883d6278fbae603f/0_356_3600_2159/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gossip Girl\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Made in Manhattan \u2026 Gossip Girl.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Gossip Girl</h2> <p>Every few months, I like to imagine the decimal point of my bank account has shifted a few spots to the right and hang out with the hyper-privileged teens of New York City\u2019s Upper East Side. The Gossip Girl world is so spectacularly removed from mine \u2013 even were I not self-isolating \u2013 that watching it gives me the same rush I imagine sci-fi fans get from films about sentient spaceships and alien incubators. The show follows a group of beautiful, obscenely wealthy teenagers living in palatial penthouses and the \u201cpoor\u201d family that enters their orbit; ah yes, so poor are the Humphreys that they are confined to a loft in Brooklyn. <br><br>Their lives are so thrillingly interesting that an anonymous blogger, Gossip Girl, follows their every move by posting pap shots and salacious rumours. The plots sit somewhere between tabloid and high art: in one story arc, an 18-year-old billionaire trades his girlfriend for a hotel; in another, an incest storyline isn\u2019t even close to the weirdest thing in that series.</p> <p>Although things happen almost constantly, nothing ever really <em>changes,</em> which makes it perfect for unending rewatches. The script is overflowing with mixed metaphors and one character\u2019s entire personality is that they love to cook waffles. It should be terrible. It should be consigned to the forgotten annals of Netflix for ever. And yet, it is amazing. The melodrama of your teens magnified by about one million percent and sprinkled with limitless money? Who wouldn\u2019t want to watch that over and over again? <strong>Kate Solomon</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a48db734262047934ed0f259b107e82c17e58e22\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a48db734262047934ed0f259b107e82c17e58e22/0_102_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zooey Deschanel in New Girl.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zooey Deschanel in New Girl.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>New Girl</h2> <p>I have had the phrase: \u201cGave me cookie, got you cookie\u201d swirling on a loop in my head for three days. Buried among every terrible coronavirus-related pun I have come up with to distract myself from the most bizarre and eerie global situation in my lifetime, is the grouchy voice of New Girl\u2019s Nick Miller delivering this line. Startlingly, it has become a sort of meditative balm. Inhale \u2026 <em>gave me cookie; </em>exhale \u2026 <em>got you cookie.</em></p> <p>To say<em> </em>New Girl is my favourite show would be an understatement. I mark my life through New Girl rewatches and sometimes I lay in bed and genuinely wonder if Nick, the recalcitrant bartender turned YA author with questionable hygiene habits (I would definitely have got the \u2019Rona from him) is my ideal man. The seven-season sitcom starring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/apr/25/zooey-deschanel-interview\">Zooey Deschanel</a> as the titular character has its axis in friendship. Zooey\u2019s sweet, quirky Jess becomes a room-mate to three men with wildly different personalities (douchey Schmidt, grumpy Nick, unexplainable weirdo Winston), and along with her feisty best friend Cece, becomes enmeshed in ridiculous hijinks with them as they meld into a highly dysfunctional and incestuous family.</p> <p>The show is funny without losing its heart and sweet without becoming cloying. It has all the intimate tenderness of a dear friend roasting you before pulling you into a hug. I started watching New Girl while depressed in my final year in university and, eight years later, it remains a show I watch when I need laughter to alleviate the darkness of the world; to remind myself of joy and where it lies: within our connections.</p> <p>In season two, episode five, Schmidt buys Nick a cookie. He saw it and thought of him. The emotionally reticent Nick is uncomfortable with the display of tenderness and, throughout the episode, agonises over how to reciprocate. Eventually he settles on returning the favour, verbalising his affection the only way he knows how: like a Neanderthal. \u201cGave me cookie, got you cookie. You gave me cookie, got you cookie! Gave me cookie, got you cookie, man!\u201d In my language that means: \u201cI love you and I\u2019m here for you\u201d and I think that\u2019s beautiful. New Girl remains a reminder that hope and joy finds a home in love and its expression. <strong>Bolu Babalola</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"111b3dbd960ca81edb67b56cfbc44d5e1b8f93c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/111b3dbd960ca81edb67b56cfbc44d5e1b8f93c9/0_221_1992_1196/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martin Sheen, Richard Schiff and Rob Lowe West Wing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">All the president\u2019s men \u2026 Martin Sheen, Richard Schiff and Rob Lowe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Shapiro/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The West Wing</h2> <p>From the moment that cheesy theme tune kicks in, I feel at home. Perhaps it is because I mainlined the series while suffering from extreme exam-related anxiety at university, but The West Wing will always be my happy place. Its depiction of late-90s Clintonian politics may seem increasingly dated, yet in the creation of a group of well-meaning, if flawed, politicos, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/aaron-sorkin\">Aaron Sorkin</a> solidified for many the way politics <em>should</em> be done.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/20/obama-west-wing-tv-drama-bartlet-aaron-sorkin-martin-sheen-allison-janney\">We got Obama elected! West Wing stars relive the parties, pranks and power games</a> </p> </aside>  <p>From Rob Lowe\u2019s puppyish Sam Seaborn, to the gruff but ultimately warm-hearted Toby Ziegler (a pitch-perfect role for Richard Schiff), every West Winger has something about them to love (except Mandy; nobody liked Mandy; she was swiftly disappeared at the end of season one). Watching <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7H_L5cYkg8\">Alison Janney\u2019s</a> bizarre performance of the Jackal never fails to bring a smile to my face \u2013 and there is a simple joy to those first four seasons of Sorkin dialogue at its best. The walk-and-talks are the stuff of legend, and the rapid-fire, flirty banter between Josh Lyman and his secretary Donna (this was of course pre-#MeToo) are reminiscent of the best black-and-white screwball comedies.</p> <p>There is even a quarantine lockdown episode \u2013 No Exit, in season five \u2013 but perhaps that\u2019s too close to home just now. Instead, I can revel in that opening episode as the word \u201cPotus\u201d rings around my head, or Martin Sheen\u2019s Latin excoriation of God in the season two finale, Two Cathedrals.

It is an episode that mirrored and coincided with the real-life Leveson inquiry and its themes, but also brings to mind Chilcot.</p> <p>Laughing obviously makes one feel better and The Thick of It is hilarious, but it is not just that. Seeing intelligence, creative competence, incredible art \u2013 if that does not sound too pretentious \u2013 is also immensely cheering. Whether it is the brilliant lines we came to expect \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m just a lad from Leeds with a lust for life\u201d; \u201cIf you make eye contact with Malcolm Tucker, you have spilled his pint\u201d; \u201cHe was only homeless in the sense that he didn\u2019t have a home\u201d \u2013 seeing the regulars at the very top of their game, or the sublimely handled mix of tone, it is an hour of perfect television.</p> <p>Some insist that the early New Labour focus of TTOI was superior, but this episode does not merely induce pleasure in its one liners but in its depth and resolve; the quiet, oblivious truth-telling by the much put-upon Robyn, and the exquisite Peter Capaldi with his Rachel Dolezal-esque facial expression when everything comes crashing down. But his final bravura speech is arrow-accurate by the writers. These days it is hard not to shove one\u2019s fist into one\u2019s mouth every time someone on Twitter grabs a clip of modern-day politics and makes the same joke: \u201cMissed this episode of The Thick of It!!!!\u201d But even that cannot stop the boost this hour gives me. <strong>Hannah Jane Parkinson</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e85b6697cff04b596d47bacdbd801f48c929646\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e85b6697cff04b596d47bacdbd801f48c929646/0_0_3600_2161/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tituss Burgess and Jane Krakowski in Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tituss Burgess and Jane Krakowski in Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Liebowitz/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt</h2> <p>I very, very rarely rewatch drama; at least not without a very big gap in between. Comedy, however, I can and do watch and rewatch, virtually on a loop. It might be Silicon Valley, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Cheers, and for most of the 90s it was of course Friends (when it was not Will &amp; Grace); but most often these days it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/unbreakable-kimmy-schmidt\">Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt</a>, Tina Fey\u2019s first post-30 Rock venture and arguably her masterwork.</p> <p>It has everything that normally makes rewatching a comedy worthwhile, turned up to 11. The jokes are not just plentiful but fast and might be pulled from any genre at any moment. Daft puns, slapstick, callbacks, character jokes, topical gags, broadbrush generic or tiny little things that depend on a Spelunker-level knowledge of the nichest of niche pop-culture references. And then there\u2019s all of Tituss.</p> <p>The individual and ensemble playing is endlessly watchable, awe-inspiring and prompts an urge to dissect it, even as such a project will and should for ever elude you. Had you world enough (and time) could you ever teach anyone else to hit the beats like Jane Krakowski does so perfectly and seemingly effortlessly? And finally there is the sheer oddity of the thing. From the premise \u2013 30-year-old woman emerges into the world after 15 years held in a bunker by her kidnapper the Rev Richard Wayne Gary Wayne \u2013 to the collection of eclectic characters. But it does, harnessing a series of idiosyncrasies to a singular, ridiculous vision and going all in on it. Utter mastery.

The choicest rewatch cuts, however, are found between season two \u2013 when Munch (Homicide: Life on the Street transfer, Richard Belzer) was partnered with Tutuola (Ice-T) \u2013 and the season 12 departure of the lead detective, Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni).</p> <p>Dogged devotion to TV formula is what Law &amp; Order does best, but those \u201cripped from the headlines\u201d plots also keep things fresh over repeated viewings, while squad room chats on issues such as consent and gender identity provide fascinating snapshots of changing social attitudes. Like the man says, these offences are \u201cespecially heinous\u201d, but there is something both cathartic and comforting about watching Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and her team put away all manner of unsavoury individuals.</p> <p>The abundance of available reruns also makes it enjoyably easy to forget which you have seen and which you have not. Do I instinctively know that the friendly-seeming schoolteacher is lying about his whereabouts because I half-remember how this one ends? Or has Law &amp; Order: SVU transformed me into a damn fine detective at last? <strong>Ellen E Jones</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a5894eb9d21d9ad557d73c504957d418c5a8cc4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a5894eb9d21d9ad557d73c504957d418c5a8cc4/0_136_1009_605/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spaced Nick Frost, Simon Pegg, Jessica Stevenson and Mark Heap\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spaced cadets \u2026 Nick Frost, Simon Pegg, Jessica Stevenson and Mark Heap.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: E4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Spaced</h2> <p>If you really put your mind to it, you can get through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/11/the-stars-of-spaced-reunited-21st-anniversary-simon-pegg-jessica-hynes-edgar-wright-nick-frost\">Spaced</a> in a single day, horsing through its two short seasons on DVD or <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/spaced\">All 4</a> in under seven hours.

There is so much that is new and worthy of our attention that going back to old, familiar ground often feels like a waste of time. There are a couple of exceptions, however, the greatest of which is Buffy, which has taken on a therapeutic role in my life.</p> <p>Many, many years ago, after a breakup, I measured the duration of my sadness by how long it took me to rewatch all seven seasons in their entirety. By the time Buffy was over, so was the heartbreak. Now, I dip in and out of my favourite episodes, but some \u2013 Hush, The Wish, The Body, Once More With Feeling, Who Are You? and Restless, to be precise \u2013 are frequently revisited. The sound of the theme music alone is the equivalent of a hot bath in mood lighting.</p> <p>There is something particularly soothing about its ultimate moral simplicity. People are flawed (and flayed), they make mistakes, and they learn how to be better. Buffy is the Chosen One, and she has to face her toughest challenges alone, but the biggest, most world-threatening villains require collective action. They need a whole graduation class\u2019s worth of students to destroy a big snakey mayor, the support of one\u2019s friends to combat a secret military base filled with monsters, a whole army of new slayers to battle the First. Now, more than ever, that feels like a message to take comfort from, from the comfort of indoors. <strong>Rebecca Nicholson</strong></p> <h2>\u2018The thought of rewatching fills me with dread\u2019</h2> <p>Rewatching TV shows, especially at a time of massive global crisis, sounds like a genuinely lovely idea that will doubtless bring a warm feeling of comfort and joy to many people\u2019s lives. Except, I won\u2019t be one of them. The thought of a repeat viewing with shows I love and which have serious rewatch potential \u2013 Arrested Development or The Office \u2013 fills me with dread. That is even true of rewatching a casual, noncommittal episode (something I only ever allow myself to do \u201cfor work\u201d).</p> <p>But outside of that: absolutely not. Never. Ever. The feeling of shame, of drowning in 10,000 other, newer shows begins to set in within milliseconds. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you finished Cheer yet?\u201d my brain says. What about Schitt\u2019s Creek? Sure, you don\u2019t know anyone who actually watches it and you have no idea what it\u2019s about, but people are always talking about it on Twitter aren\u2019t they? What about the new series of This Country, or Shrill, or literally anything else that you\u2019ve not already seen? And that\u2019s before you even get to the classics. What about Breaking Bad, that show you watched one series of and never thought about ever again? Maybe now\u2019s the time to get really, really into that like everyone else did 10 years ago. Or Game of Thrones: that was a bit of a big deal, maybe you ought to finish that one?</p> <p>The whole thing is just another source of anxiety, to be honest, which is a shame because I would love to watch The Office Christmas specials guilt-free. Just once, ideally this summer, while all my other plans are off. <strong>Hannah J Davies</strong></p>",
  "<p>The ice-cream shop Island Pops in Brooklyn usually sees its business pick up from a winter lull this time of year, when the days are longer and the spring weather sets in.</p> \n<p>Instead, its doors are closed to walk-in customers at the order of health authorities hoping to stem the spread of coronavirus by keeping people in New York City out of restaurants, bars, gyms and movie theaters.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/coronavirus-us-bailout-what-you-need-to-know\">$1,200 checks for all?

Early last year, a flu she suffered stymied his cinematic vision for popping the question during a scheduled trip to Colorado that would have afforded a jaunt to a gorgeous snow-filled valley. So the film-maker scouted a new exterior location in New Mexico, near his parents\u2019 home in El Paso \u2013 the site of their next trip. This provided his ultimate, successful proposal with a sandy backdrop, plus snow-dusted mountains in the distance.</p> <p>The cinephiles remain determined to marry at their original venue, the Motion Picture &amp; Television Fund retirement community for showbiz vets in Woodland Hills, California. Clymer works there and wants all the retirees she\u2019s bonded with to attend her reception in their own backyard.

Official data seen by Guardian Australia indicates there were 115 cases in that category on Thursday, with a further 432 cases under investigation.</p> <p>As of Thursday night, it appeared unlikely that stage 3 lockdowns would be imposed in the most populous states before the weekend, and the Morrison government wants to stretch the time before that happens as long as possible. Data collected by the government through the Citymapper app points to a substantial drop off in movement around cities since the government closed the border, and restrictions on crowds were imposed in mid-March.</p> <p>As well as establishing the trigger points for the next sequence of lockdowns, Friday\u2019s meeting will also consider as yet uncompleted work on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/national-cabinet-to-consider-lockdowns-for-coronavirus-hotspots-and-help-for-renters\">financial assistance measures for renters</a> and landlords. The nuts and bolts of that package are being worked up by treasurers, with the states responsible for residential tenancies and the commonwealth dealing with commercial landlords and renters.</p> <p>The states are looking to ensure that residential tenants don\u2019t get evicted over the coming months if they cannot pay their rent and will propose options to ensure there are no rent increases during the crisis.</p> <p>The Morrison government wants the states to offer land tax relief for landlords, but is unlikely to get the states on board. The commonwealth is considering tax relief for landlords prepared to either cut rent or provide rent holidays for their tenants.</p> <p>The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, is also prevailing on the banks to help carry the load of suspended rental income for the duration of the crisis. The insurance industry has also been in talks with the Morrison government over the rent package.</p> <p>It is believed insurers are concerned they may be on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars in payments under landlord insurance policies. The insurance covers landlords for a variety of problems, including non-payment of rent. It is believed most policies do not exclude non-payment caused by a pandemic.<br><br>\u201cThe insurance industry is aware of discussions around the impact of Covid-19 on commercial and domestic rents and is talking to government about the issue,\u201d an Insurance Council of Australia spokesman said.</p> <p>Also on the agenda for Friday\u2019s national cabinet meeting is a conversation about reducing the amount of elective dental surgery to free up protective equipment. There will also be another conversation about schools in an effort to land on a national position.</p> <p>Morrison held talks with education unions this week and is attempting to broker arrangements where schools around the country move to provide distance learning by term two but campuses remain open for students who need to attend because their parents are essential services workers, or because they are in disadvantaged households.</p> <p>With the economy already profoundly disrupted by the pandemic, business and unions are attempting to recalibrate industrial arrangements.

The measure, which would cost $21bn for three months assuming 1.7m Australians are displaced from their jobs, was one proposal put to treasury officials at a meeting on Wednesday.</p> <p>The government is examining wage subsidies for the third round of stimulus but is reluctant to adopt income support that gives more assistance to higher income earners than workers on average incomes or minimum wages. It also wants to deliver support through the existing tax and transfer system.</p> <p>The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said the government had not adopted a wage guarantee because \u201cthe advice in front of us was that that was not the best way in an Australian context\u201d to provide support, because \u201cthe existing jobseeker payment framework\u201d \u2013 unemployment benefits \u2013 would reach households faster.</p> <p>The government is yet to respond to Labor\u2019s call to change the income threshold and taper rates for unemployment benefits so more families are able to access jobseeker payments where one partner is jobless but the other earns more than $48,000.</p> <p>Options are still being developed by the social services minister, Anne Ruston, and the government characterises an agreement between the prime minister and the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, as a commitment only to consider changes with a view to expanding eligibility.</p>",
  "<p>Facade has always been central to figure skating. The sport\u2019s culture dictates that athletes should smile through pain and errors. In the <a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/p/what-does-kiss-cry-mean-in-figure-skating-the-little-nook-is-a-big-part-of-olympics-coverage-8229793\">\u2018kiss and cry\u2019 area</a> - where skaters wait for their scores \u2013 there are rarely dramatic displays. Even when a performance is unfairly marked by the judges, skaters will blow kisses to the camera and wave to the crowd. However peeved they may be, they\u2019ll never reveal it, preferring instead to suffer in silence. Burying true feelings just goes with the territory.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a vicious cycle when you live inside the bubble,\u201d says Kiira Korpi, a two-time Olympian for Finland who is now a psychology student at the New School in Manhattan and a children\u2019s rights activist. \u201cYou don\u2019t even realise how unhealthy or toxic some of the cultural norms are.\u201d</p> <p>Last week should have seen the world championships take place in Montreal, but the Covid-19 pandemic <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2020-03-11/world-figure-skating-championships-canceled-coronavirus-concerns\">put paid to that</a>. Unintentionally, it may have shifted the landscape of women\u2019s figure skating in the process.</p> <p>Barring a minor miracle, three Russian teenagers would have battled it out for the podium places: 16-year-old Alena Kostornaia and a pair of 15-year-olds, Anna Shcherbakova and Alexandra Trusova. The trio have revolutionized figure skating. They only made their senior debuts last year but blitzed through the sport, ensuring a multitude of headlines. In the Grand Prix final last December, Kostornaia claimed gold while Shcherbakova and Trusova rounded out the medals. They repeated the trick at the European championships the following month; their opponents left dumbstruck by their dominance.</p> <p>What makes them so good? Well, owing to their remarkable jumps, they maximize the technical points on offer. Trusova and Shcherbakova have both mastered skating\u2019s holy grail: the quad, an exhaustive element \u2013 and up until recently an unheard-of feat for ladies, which is four full rotations in the air.</p> <p>However, there are concerns. First, rather than a skating competition for women, are we now dealing with a jumping competition for girls? Second, and much more importantly, what\u2019s the cost of success \u2013 physically, emotionally and psychologically \u2013 for this collection of raw, developing children?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/17/figure-skating-john-coughlin-and-the-disturbing-reality-of-athlete-on-athlete-abuse\">Figure skating, John Coughlin and the disturbing reality of athlete-on-athlete abuse</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe worst aspect to this is that most of the time, in skating and gymnastics and maybe other sports, you grow up in a culture that\u2019s very authoritarian,\u201d Korpi says. \u201cYou grow up to believe if you get injured it\u2019s because you\u2019re weak. Or if your body or psychological state fails it\u2019s because you are weak. But why does the body of a teenager break?</p> <p>\u201cObviously, the athlete has responsibility but we never really question if there\u2019s something wrong with the coaching. Has there been a lot of over-training? I hear from doctors about 12-year-olds in America, Finland and Sweden \u2013 and I\u2019m sure in Russia it starts even earlier \u2013 coming to clinics with stress fractures and things which shouldn\u2019t happen at that age. It points to the fact the training has been too much. And how do they deal with that when they\u2019re so young?\u201d</p> <p>All three Russian teenagers boast the same coach: Eteri Tutberidze, who has built a stable of female talent. She is a divisive figure, though not much is known about her \u2013 unusual for a skating community that can border on the incestuous. She made her name as a coach in 2014 when a 15-year-old girl in a red dress named Yulia Lipnitskaya cast a spell in Sochi and was crucial to Russia winning gold in the team event. She became a star. The following month, she finished second at the world championships but was quickly discarded as her body began to develop. By the end of 2016, she was done with the sport altogether. Drained and disillusioned, the following year she revealed a long-running battle with anorexia. \u201cI\u2019m no longer drawn to the ice,\u201d she said, damningly.</p> <p>By that stage, Tutberidze had moved on and guided another prodigy, Evgenia Medvedeva, to back-to-back European and world titles. But at the 2018 Olympics, Medvedeva <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/23/olympic-figure-skating-zagitova-medvedeva\">was pipped to first place by her training mate</a>, 15-year-old Alina Zagitova, three years her junior. Tutberidze had a new favorite and within months, Medvedeva made a startling and unprecedented move. She left Russia altogether, deciding to continue her skating career in Canada. \u201cI feel more adult here,\u201d Medvedeva said later in 2018.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b81c6a1fd9417b33a3e977acee423c816d105dfb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b81c6a1fd9417b33a3e977acee423c816d105dfb/0_0_4924_3306/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Evgenia Medvedeva and Eteri Tutberidze\" width=\"1000\" height=\"671\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Evgenia Medvedeva reacts with coach Eteri Tutberidze after she was pipped for gold in the women\u2019s free skate at the Pyeongchang Olympics.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maddie Meyer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And then there\u2019s Zagitova, the reigning Olympic and world champion. Still just 17, she announced in December that she was taking a break from skating for an indefinite period. The previous month, she had admitted finding it difficult to keep up with younger competitors, who she still trained alongside in Moscow. Most worryingly of all, she described how even attempting a quad jump was unrealistic for her until she got slimmer.</p> <p>\u201cQuads are too dangerous for me for the time being,\u201d she said. \u201cI will need to prepare for them physically and mentally. I will also need to lose some weight, something like 3kg, to decrease the risk of injuries.\u201d</p> <p>And this is a cornerstone of the debate surrounding the jumping phenomenon in women\u2019s skating and the rise of the so-called Russian Dolls: the female body.</p> <p>Puberty can vastly change how a skater performs. They grow taller, and heavier. It\u2019s expected. Most critically of all, it\u2019s natural. But in some skating quarters it\u2019s seen as an unwanted development and detrimental to skills such as the quad jump. Physical changes mean tweaking of techniques. And sometimes, coaches don\u2019t have the interest or patience. They\u2019ll merely find a younger skater to shape instead. Somebody who is prepubescent and weighs less. So, it\u2019s a genuine possibility that skaters on the edge of adolescence are buying into a fear and suspicion of puberty. And in a society where body image and the messaging surrounding it is such a hot topic, it seems skating has aligned itself with a deeply unsettling pattern.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous,\u201d Korpi says. \u201cI was never educated on the effects of not getting your period. The expectation was that it was a good thing. Nobody was talking about the symptoms it can create, the psychological problems, the stress fractures that can happen due to the fact you don\u2019t get enough energy and your hormonal function not working. So we need to call out the community for sending these unhealthy messages. This notion you should always restrict your food and always lose weight and no matter what you must restrict, restrict. That kind of messaging is so concerning.</p> <p>\u201cI know many athletes who are emotionally and physically broken because the system doesn\u2019t care how much goes to waste as long as there are a few who make it. But what\u2019s worrying is that those who make it are only there for a few years and then they\u2019re broken too: they\u2019re \u2018too old\u2019 or can\u2019t sustain their careers.\u201d</p> <p>Korpi has a particular academic interest in the abuse of children and sees such behaviour as commonplace within skating circles.</p> <p>\u201cThere can be serious emotional abuse in training and coaching,\u201d Korpi says. \u201cMaybe skating is specifically vulnerable to child abuse because of the way the sport has developed and the way we value those crazy jumps and how it\u2019s easier to do them when you don\u2019t have an adult body yet. So the more robotic you can treat your mind and body the better. The coach is the one that holds the key to success. But if their coaching is emotionally abusive it can have very drastic consequences and has been compared a lot to the abuse between children and parents.\u201d</p> <p>Some say it\u2019s an overreaction. That skating has always produced exceptional, young talent. And it\u2019s worth mentioning that coaches such as Tutberidze are working within the ISU\u2019s age-limit rules. Ultimately, her job is to develop champions and she would certainly argue that everything else \u2013 regardless of the moral implications \u2013 is not a coach\u2019s concern.</p> <p>\u201cSkating has had child stars \u2013 Tara Lipinski, Michelle Kwan, Sarah Hughes \u2013 but they weren\u2019t pushed out of the sport because they couldn\u2019t keep up with the technical demands,\u201d Korpi says.</p> <p>Because of the postponed world championships, the trio of Russian teenagers may not compete again competitively until the end of the year. By that stage, their bodies may have changed dramatically and Tutberidze may have moved on to her next project.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Eteri\u2019s child factory is the biggest problem in skating,\u201d Korpi says. \u201cThe problem is the sick culture that\u2019s been created. Eteri\u2019s factory is a symptom of this inhumane direction and culture our sport is taking. She\u2019s not the cause. There are many other coaches who work in a similar manner to her and many federations that support this kind of coaching.\u201d</p> <p>So, it seems like skating has a decision to make: keep the facade in place or start to ask itself some tough questions.</p> <p>\u201cFor many people, it\u2019s not interesting anymore,\u201d says Korpi. \u201cPeople miss watching emotionally mature women skate instead of girls. It\u2019s almost \u2013 and I feel this too \u2013 difficult to watch some of these very, very young child stars. Because you can\u2019t help and think of what\u2019s behind that kind of performance and success.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>It begins like any other daring escape mission: a packed bag, a methodical plan gone slightly awry, split-second brushes with danger, a narrowly avoided exposure. But Esther Shapiro, portrayed by Shira Haas in the lead role of Netflix\u2019s new miniseries Unorthodox, is neither secret agent nor jailbird. She\u2019s a Hasidic Jew in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, and she\u2019s making a break for Berlin. If she\u2019s fleeing a prison, she\u2019s only doing so in the most strictly metaphorical sense. For the past year, Esther has been suffocating in a loveless arranged marriage and, at age 19, she wants a second chance while she\u2019s still got her youth.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/25/incredible-story-of-netflix-feelgood-crip-camp-it-blew-my-mind\">'It blew my mind': the incredible story of Netflix's feelgood Crip Camp</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It sounds like ready-made human drama, but Deborah Feldman really lived it. She detailed her time in New York, her risky departure from the <em>derech</em> (a Hebrew word meaning \u201cpath\u201d), and her personal reinvention in Germany with the memoir Unorthodox: The Scandalous Rejection of My Hasidic Roots in 2012. A teenage mother, she severed ties with her husband as well as the repressive patriarchy he came to represent, and eventually took advantage of the German citizenship afforded by her great-grandfather to settle in Berlin. She enrolled her son in the local school system, and that\u2019s how she came to meet Anna Winger.</p> <p>Like her, Winger was raising a child after coming to Berlin from faraway places. Winger had spent her youth hopping between Massachusetts, Mexico and Kenya with her anthropologist parents, ultimately finding a home on the same terms as Feldman.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019d talked a lot about the experience of being Jewish in Germany, and how there are common themes throughout,\u201d Winger tells the Guardian over the phone from her home in Berlin, as a youngster\u2019s voice eagerly anticipates afternoon bagels in the background. \u201cDislocation, a reason for coming, grappling with history, the metropolitan New York-ness of Berlin. There was a lot of common ground we\u2019d found in normal conversation. The show, in a funny way, became our way to build out from those talks.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zVhRId0BTw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-zVhRId0BTw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Winger had created Deutschland 83, a hit TV series tracking the movements of an East German spy on the western side of the wall during the cold war era, and she recognized potential for a new project in Feldman\u2019s extraordinary journey. \u201cAs someone who\u2019s an outsider, my whole body of work in TV speaks to Berlin\u2019s history and identity in one way or another,\u201d Winger says. \u201cI\u2019ve lived here now for 17 years, and I think that one of the things that makes the city really striking is how layers of history exist simultaneously. My other show takes place in divided Berlin, with a spy going from East to West. We also have two worlds in Unorthodox, with a specific vision of both Berlin and New York.\u201d</p> <p>A considerably greater distance separates the Jewish enclave of Brooklyn from Esther\u2019s refuge across the Atlantic, and Winger (along with co-creator Alexa Karolinski and series director Maria Schrader) required some artistic license to traverse it. The real Feldman remained in New York for some time after going OTD \u2013 that\u2019s \u201coff the <em>derech\u201d</em> \u2013 while her avatar Esther hightails it directly out of America. For the sake of an arc-based narrative, Esther gains a musical motivation, pursuing acceptance to an elite orchestral and choral program. \u201cThere\u2019s a real music academy called the Barenboim-Said Akademie where Jews and Muslims play classical music together, like a whole utopia,\u201d Winger explains. \u201cWe were inspired by this idea, as the sort of institution that could only begin in Berlin.\u201d</p> <p>Feldman\u2019s story had everything except a villain, so Winger shifted a portion of the four episodes\u2019 perspective to Esther\u2019s husband Yanky (Amit Rahav). Because he\u2019s a real schlemiel (a Yiddish term referring approximately to the kind of guy who\u2019s always spilling his soup) and intermittently sympathetic, Winger invented the harsher Moishe (Jeff Wilbusch) as a partner on the trip to retrieve Esther. His presence implicitly tacks a \u201cby force, if necessary\u201d on to the previous sentence. \u201cDeborah gave us a lot of creative freedom,\u201d Winger says, \u201cbut she was also excited about us coming up with something that speaks to present-day Berlin, which doesn\u2019t appear in the book.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1c245c4caffb8bc71b702f68e5745d8012c8c8dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c245c4caffb8bc71b702f68e5745d8012c8c8dc/0_0_3600_2403/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shira Haas stars as Esther Shapiro in Unorthodox.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shira Haas stars as Esther Shapiro in Unorthodox.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anika Molnar/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The city, a meeting point of the past and future for modern Jewry, emerged as the linchpin of the show\u2019s conflicted perspective on religious identity. The memory of the Holocaust has a more palpable presence there than in any American city, but Esther\u2019s multicultural group of new friends take more interest in clubbing than visiting memorials to genocide. She\u2019s likewise torn between independence and reverence, rejecting the strictures of her Satmar sect even as she maintains a deeper, broader relationship to the Jewish faith. Her connection to Judaism forms an integral part of her notion of self, and she\u2019s defensive of something most outsiders can\u2019t understand. For Winger, gaining insight on the insular and exclusive world of Hasidim was a must.</p> <p>\u201cThe first person we hired was this incredible guy, Eli Rosen, who was our Yiddish translator and cultural consultant,\u201d Winger recalls. \u201cHe was a cantor before he left the community, and we had him on set every day working with the actors and the language. It\u2019s not just that it\u2019s Yiddish \u2013 it\u2019s that there are 13 or 14 different kinds of Yiddish, and we needed everyone speaking the right dialect, which is a Hungarian Yiddish mixed with some English. It\u2019s a very particular patois that they speak in Brooklyn, sometimes just from neighborhood to neighborhood. You might say something a bit differently in Borough Park than you would in Williamsburg. Hyper-localized.\u201d</p> <p>She also tapped actors from New Yiddish Rep, a New York theatre company with a healthy membership of OTD twentysomethings and thirtysomethings. \u201cWe met people, went to homes, and learned about their individual journeys,\u201d Winger continues. \u201cJewish culture is almost like a spectrum from orthodox observance to secularism, but there\u2019s always more uniting us than dividing us. If anything, that should be the message of the show.\u201d</p> <p>These collaborators provided a way into the Yiddish tongue; like many present-day Jews in the west, Winger heard her grandparents use the occasional slang but never learned it herself. (Mastering German, English and Spanish kept her plenty busy.) The language now stands as a link to a rich vein of heritage that must be consciously maintained in order to survive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b6b75886de5ace1e4e3fe26c2be9c8bf11ef8d6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6b75886de5ace1e4e3fe26c2be9c8bf11ef8d6e/0_0_3600_2403/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Esther Shapiro escapes her loveless marriage for Berlin in the Netflix series Unorthodox.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Esther Shapiro escapes her loveless marriage for Berlin in the Netflix series Unorthodox.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anika Molnar/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cDoing this in Yiddish was part of the project from the beginning,\u201d Winger says. It was the language of literature and theatre. It\u2019s been preserved by the religious community, and the Hasidim are the only ones that speak it on a daily basis. There were about 10 different people involved with this project that came from the community, in one way or another \u2026 We thought it was important that everyone playing the Hasidic characters actually be Jewish, because we wanted the audience to have a familiarity with the language by the time they\u2019ve seen the episodes, even if it\u2019s just an emotional familiarity.\u201d</p> <p>Unorthodox joins the Israeli series Shtisel in Netflix\u2019s limited library of Yiddish-language programming, but they both fit into a wider trend of forwardly Jewish programming on the small screen over the past few years. Esther\u2019s uphill battle to obtain a divorce mirrors that of The Marvelous Mrs Maisel\u2019s heroine Midge as she splits from her husband, while elsewhere, the Nazi-killers of Hunters get kosher revenge. The Plot Against America tackles antisemitism head-on every Sunday night at HBO, and back in 2017, hip studio A24 brought Yiddish to the big screen with Menashe, a drama set entirely within Borough Park.</p> <p>\u201cI have to say that while we were working on this show, we didn\u2019t see ourselves as fitting into something larger than us,\u201d Winger confesses. \u201cI wish I had a better answer. It makes me feel strangely comforted to think that other people were also approaching these same issues in other creative ways.\u201d</p> <p>Steeped as Unorthodox may be in the particulars of Jewish life and culture, Winger sees Esther and Feldman\u2019s twinned pilgrimage to freedom as a more primal act. Much in the same respect that the Jewish religion was founded on such core human values as resilience, togetherness and respect, so too can an account of a woman claiming agency in her own life operate on a universal frequency. Winger and Feldman came together as expatriates, and they believe audiences will be able to forge that bond just as naturally.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an uplifting story,\u201d Winger says. \u201cIf you follow it through to the end, it\u2019s about people finding their way in the world, defining their own <em>derech</em>, and that\u2019s relatable to everyone. It\u2019s a specific circumstance, but in that specificity, it becomes weirdly accessible \u2026 Anyone who feels a need to struggle for individuality against their community, they\u2019ll find some of themselves in the show. I hope it\u2019s a little bit cathartic, and leaves people who might like to start something somewhere else with hope. It\u2019s all about renewal.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Unorthodox is now available on Netflix</p></li> </ul>",

There are no land borders with Italy, while France, Switzerland, Austria and Slovenia \u2013 all countries that are doing much better \u2013 do have them.</p> <p>This may, in fact, be one of the reasons for the country\u2019s late response. Spain thought it was far enough away. \u201cSpain will only have a handful of cases,\u201d said Dr Fernando Sim\u00f3n, the head of medical emergencies in Madrid, on 9 February. Six weeks later he gives out daily figures of hundreds of deaths.

  "<p>By the time they locked down Italy, it seemed like it was already too late. Hundreds of people there had died of Covid-19 , with thousands infected. Over the next two weeks, the death toll soared. In New Zealand, we have oddly been in the opposite position: no one has died from the virus. Seven people are in hospital but they\u2019re not in intensive care or on ventilators. There are more than 280 people confirmed to have the disease.</p> <p>Yet this country has begun at least four weeks of some of the strictest restrictions anywhere in the world to fight Covid-19, clamping down on most movement, association and \u2013 to the chagrin of some \u2013 shopping, in the hope that a tragedy like the one unfolding in Italy and elsewhere can be avoided. </p> <p>There wasn\u2019t time to finesse plans \u2013 to ensure everything was perfect \u2013 before the rules came into effect, Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/ardern-urges-new-zealanders-to-act-like-you-have-covid-19-as-lockdown-looms\"> told us on Wednesday.</a> We were just going to essentially give it a punt.

We had dinner as usual (takeaways \u2013 because who knows when we\u2019ll next have those?). Children played on a driveway up the street. Only the teeth-clenching sound of an alert blaring from our phones thanks to Civil Defence officials, reminding us of the impending lockdown \u2013 and providing a hefty shot of adrenaline to anyone who wasn\u2019t already on edge \u2013 reiterated what was about to happen.</p> <p>It was faintly surreal to prepare to hunker down without having seen the enemy yet. Most New Zealanders don\u2019t have Covid-19.Most New Zealanders don\u2019t know anyone who has Covid-19. They don\u2019t know anyone who knows anyone who has Covid-19</p> <p>For most of us the spread of the virus so far had been a matter of inconvenience. Life was close to normal. At the weekend, I was briefly stymied to learn I could not take the kids to the museum, so we took them on a bush walk instead. We still went to swimming lessons, a cafe for brunch. We took precautions, but when we ambled into supermarkets for late-night cheese purchases, queues were not long and the essentials (cheese) were still available.</p> <p>In other nations the dismantling of public life did not come as a surprise when it happened \u2013 things felt bad already in many cases. But for New Zealand in peacetime it felt downright bizarre.</p> <p>On Wednesday night, people out walking \u2013 the single approved outdoor pastime, beyond shopping for groceries and seeking medical help \u2013 took exaggerated arcs on the footpath to avoid each other, and near-empty buses sped past like limousines ferrying just one or two people each. </p> <p>At first I wondered if life would change for me after the new measures began. I am an introvert and long walks are already my favourite hobby. I constantly promise to see my friends and then never actually see them. It\u2019s been years since I darkened the doors of a nightclub. And unlike my husband, who could not do his job from home on Monday and sat on the couch eating creme eggs, which he is allergic to, I have worked at our house for four years and am used to the mental pitfalls.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/ardern-urges-new-zealanders-to-act-like-you-have-covid-19-as-lockdown-looms\">Ardern urges New Zealanders to 'act like you have Covid-19' as lockdown looms</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But then I think about dinner out for my birthday next week, getting a coffee at the corner cafe, the playgrounds, the pools, board games with friends, seeing their babies, the library, getting ice creams with the kids. I thought I was a homebody but I\u2019d bargained without all of these little measures that we spool out through our day or week or month to feel and be part of things.</p> <p>When I was involved in covering the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/christchurch-shooting-brenton-tarrant-pleads-guilty-to-new-zealand-mosque-attacks-that-killed-51\">Christchurch terrorist attack</a> last March, I wondered if our relaxed way of life would change as a result of what had happened. And for a tiny while, it seemed there was a tension in the streets, armed police everywhere. But eventually life just sort of went back to normal, at least in public. New Zealanders pride themselves on that, that nothing \u2013 no matter what \u2013 changes the \u201cshe\u2019ll be right\u201d way in which they\u2019ve become accustomed to living.</p> <p>But Covid-19 has changed that, and very suddenly. Still, the hope is that if everyone plays by the rules, it needn\u2019t change things forever.</p> <p>What we don\u2019t have a sense of yet is what the enduring image of this crisis will be: the line around the block outside an Auckland gun shop \u2013 a culture this country has tried to reject after the mass shooting in Christchurch \u2013 or the electronic traffic billboards re-purposed with the exhortation to \u201cbe kind\u201d. I think we know the country we want to be revealed as, the country we want to be. And when we all emerge blinking into the sunlight after this is over, the best possible scenario would be to find that, in true New Zealand fashion, nothing much has happened at all.</p>",

Nature day, or Sizdah Bedhar, is celebrated on the 13th of the first month of the Persian new year, marking the end of the Nowruz celebrations before a return to work.

The government has been widely criticised within Iran for not taking more stringent measures earlier, but Rouhani repeatedly claiming the crisis was under control pointed to statistics on declining numbers of rail journeys and cancelled hotel bookings to claim the guidance was largely being followed.</p> \n  <p>The President also said only a third of government employees should be in work, with a large proportion of those permitted to work being health workers. He said more than 1.2m of the 2.5m government employees would continue to be kept away from work.</p> \n  <p>Claiming the coronavirus pandemic was about to enter a second phase in Iran, he praised those Iranians that had abided by advice and not travelled to holiday resorts during Iran\u2019s new year break, but there is clearly a concern that the pandemic will spread again when millions return from their holidays. The ability of Iran to track those with the infection is limited, and promises by the army to clear the streets have been made before, only for little to happen.</p> \n  <p><strong>Rouhani also claimed the issue of US economic sanctions on Iran was set to be raised at the UN Security Council</strong>. The head of the Central Bank of Iran claimed Iran had made progress in being allowed to repatriate its assets in overseas banks to purchase medicines following fresh guidance to banks.</p> \n  <p>The US has claimed it has allowed Iran to purchase medicines, but banks have been wary of financing the deals.</p> \n  <p>Rouhani has already announced that prisoners released on furlough will now not be required to return to jail at the beginning of April, as originally planned, but instead the end of the April, an implicit admission that the pandemic is going to take longer to control than originally hoped.</p> \n  <p>There is widespread distrust within Iran of official daily government figures on the numbers killed or infected by the disease.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-25T10:35:59.319Z\">at 10.35am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7b30148f08af215f6facfa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sarahboseley\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-25T10:22:31.169Z\">10.22am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>China\u2019s tough lockdown and social distancing measures in Wuhan and other provinces appear to have successfully ended coronavirus infections</strong> and may chart a route back to normal life, according to a report from the University of London\u2019s Imperial College, <strong>Sarah Boseley</strong>, the Guardian\u2019s health editor, reports.</p> \n  <p>The report, from Prof Neil Ferguson and his team who have been the main modellers of the epidemic for the UK and other governments, suggests it is possible to lift the social distancing restrictions, as China has begun to do, without a resurgence of the epidemic. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ebd852246f24d35a28a35b9ed674d9cf9f0d862\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ebd852246f24d35a28a35b9ed674d9cf9f0d862/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Residents get out of a bus in Wuhan, China, on Wednesday after the public transport was partly resumed in the city\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Residents get out of a bus in Wuhan, China, on Wednesday after the public transport was partly resumed in the city.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP via Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Prof Chris Donnelly of Imperial and Oxford Universities, one of the team, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>At this difficult time, these results suggest that, after containment, a carefully managed and monitored relaxation of effective large-scale lockdowns may be possible even before an effective vaccine is available.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Ferguson said their analysis \u201cprovides some hope for countries currently in various levels of lockdown that once case numbers are brought to low levels, it might be possible to relax social distancing \u2013 provided equal measures to limit the risk of the resurgence of transmission are introduced.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But, he stressed, relaxing the lockdown policies would depend on \u201crapid and ubiquitous testing and rigorous case and contact isolation policies\u201d. </p> \n  <p>That would mean testing everyone with symptoms and following up and isolating their contacts, in order to stamp out any further flare-ups of infection.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-25T10:32:28.171Z\">at 10.32am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7b2cf58f081e5eda23656b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-25T10:13:14.329Z\">10.13am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Restrictions on movement brought in to curb the spread of the coronavirus are <strong>preventing aid from reaching refugees and displaced peoples</strong>, the Norwegian Refugee council has said. </p> \n  <p>The organisation said 300,000 refugees in the Middle East are among those who it is not able to reach, as it called on governments to relax border restrictions for the delivery of humanitarian aid.</p> \n  <p>Appealing to world leaders, Jan Egeland, the NRC secretary general, said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>While governments are taking tough and much-needed measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus, millions of refugees and displaced people still depend on humanitarian assistance.

disease, such as coughing or shortness of breath, before being referred for testing.</p> \n  <p>The change is a response to a backlog of 40,000 cases awaiting testing, and an additional 20,000 people per day seeking testing, which has \u201ccast the net too widely\u201d.</p> \n  <p>The chief medical officer, Tony Holohan, said this had led to inappropriate testing and the goal now was to focus on people in hospital, healthcare workers and other priority categories.</p> \n  <p>Of 17,992 tests carried out so far 6% have tested positive. Authorities hope in coming weeks to increase capacity to 15,000 tests a day.

But Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary insisted that sites could remain open where social distancing is observed and claimed it was essential for infrastructure works to continue and dangerous cladding to be removed from buildings.</p> \n  <p>Those sites that cannot operate within the rules should shut immediately, he said in a round of broadcast interviews.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There will be construction sites where following the government guidelines is possible.

Germany and France have been criticised in recent weeks for imposing export bans on some of these products.

claiming success in controlling the outbreak which just one month ago saw thousands of confirmations a day.</p> \n  <p>However, residents and analysts have questioned the near-zero rate of community transmissions, expressing concern that the Chinese government is prioritising economic recovery over total virus containment. </p> \n  <p>The low figures have led Chinese authorities to lift stringent travel restrictions in Hubei, effectively freeing millions of people from two months of extraordinary lockdown.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a

Temples, gurdwaras and mosques, usually overflowing with life, stood silent.</p> \n  <p>The lockdown will have a particularly calamitous impact on the 300m Indians who live below the poverty line, and exist hand to mouth. The reality of a lockdown for the tens of millions who live on the streets; for the swathes of large families who live crammed into a single room often with no ventilation or running water; and for the rickshaw drivers who live in their rickshaws and rely entirely on their daily income is likely to be devastating.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7abfe18f081e5eda236337\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/davidsmith\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-25T04:14:52.168Z\">4.14am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <h2>Trump seeks to reopen \u2018large sections\u2019 of US by Easter, clashing with experts</h2> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\" style=\"background-color: rgb(246, 246, 246);\">Donald Trump</a> is aiming to reopen \u201clarge sections of the country\u201d by Easter, he told reporters on Tuesday, as officials advised anyone who has recently left New York to self-quarantine for two weeks.<br></p> \n  <p>The US president has put himself on collision course with his own health experts by floating a deadline for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/trump-vows-to-open-up-our-country-even-as-deaths-from-coronavirus-rise\">firing up the economy</a>, claiming without evidence that the current shutdown would cause more deaths than the coronavirus itself.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI hope we can do this by Easter,\u201d Trump told reporters at an unusually brisk White House briefing. \u201cI think that would be a great thing for our country.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Asked if that timeline \u2013 12 April \u2013 was realistic , he replied: \u201cWe\u2019re going to look at it.

  "<p>The high court has rejected calls to free hundreds of immigration detainees who, lawyers and human rights activists say, are at risk from Covid-19 while behind bars.</p> <p>The ruling, following a hearing over Skype on Wednesday, was handed down in response to an urgent legal challenge from <a href=\"https://detentionaction.org.uk/\">Detention Action</a>.</p> <p>The legal action asked for the release of hundreds of detainees who are particularly vulnerable to serious illness or death if they contract the virus because of particular health conditions, and also for the release of those from about 50 countries to which the Home Office is currently unable to remove people because of the pandemic.</p> <p>The two judges \u2013 Dame Victoria Sharp, president of the Queen\u2019s Bench division, and Mr Justice Swift \u2013 came down strongly on the side of the Home Office and highlighted the range of measures already being implemented by the home secretary, Priti Patel.</p> <p>These included the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/21/home-office-releases-300-from-detention-centres-amid-covid-19-pandemic\">release of more than 300 detainees</a> last week, ongoing assessments of the vulnerability of individual detainees to the virusand a range of \u201csensible\u201d and \u201cpractical\u201d steps the Home Office is taking to make detention centres safer, such as single occupancy rooms and the provision of face masks for detainees who wish to wear them.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems likely that the arrangements already in place by the secretary of state will be sufficient to address the risks arising in the majority of cases,\u201d the judges said, adding that \u201cthe present circumstances are exceptional\u201d.</p> <p>The court hearing on Wednesday heard that 736 people are still being detained in the UK, while 350 have been released in recent days. It was also confirmed that detainees in three detention centres have displayed symptoms of Covid-19.</p> <p>The Home Office previously confirmed to the Guardian one case of Covid-19 on Sunday at Yarl\u2019s Wood immigration removal centre in Bedfordshire, which mainly houses women.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/million-undocumented-migrants-could-go-hungry-say-charities\">Million undocumented migrants could go hungry, say charities</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The court heard that in a second centre - Brook House, near Gatwick airport - one detainee who had displayed symptoms was reportedly serving food to other detainees just before he fell ill.</p> <p>Chris Buttler, representing Detention Action and also representing a detainee who lawyers say is at greater risk from Covid-19 because he suffers from high blood pressure, told the court that expert evidence suggests the virus \u201cwill run rampant\u201d through detention facilities.</p> <p>He argued that the home secretary was acting unlawfully and falsely imprisoning many detainees because removals are no longer possible to 49 countries and it is difficult to remove people to many others.</p> <p>He said that the Home Office was a \u201cglaring exception\u201d to the government\u2019s moves to suppress Covid-19 and that leaving people in detention would further burden the already overstretched NHS when they get sick.</p> <p>\u201cThe home secretary is arguably falsely imprisoning some clients who there is no realistic risk of removing,\u201d Buttler told the court.</p> <p>Lisa Giovannetti QC, representing the Home Office, told the court: \u201cGovernment accepts all reasonable steps should be taken to shield people in high-risk categories and we have been proceeding on that basis. I can\u2019t claim the system is perfect but it\u2019s a reasonable one.\u201d</p> <p>She said reviews to identify the most vulnerable detainees were under way and this process is due to be completed imminently, adding that numbers in immigration detention have fallen substantially from 1,200 in January to 736 now.</p> <p>As part of Detention Action\u2019s case, the public health expert Prof Richard Coker, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, provided an expert report warning that prisons and detention centres provide ideal incubation conditions for the rapid spread of the coronavirus, and that about 60% of those in detention could be rapidly infected if the virus gets into these locked facilities.</p> <p>Toufique Hossain of Duncan Lewis Solicitors, who brought the case, said: \u201cThis litigation has brought about the release of hundreds of detainees, preventing many from suffering serious harm.</p> <p>\u201cHundreds more remain in detention in terrible conditions. Though we are disappointed with the ruling today, this action has clearly focused the minds at the Home Office on vulnerable individuals they usually wilfully neglect.\u201d</p> <p>Bella Sankey, Director of Detention Action, said: <em>\u201c</em>While the high court declined to grant our interim relief tonight, our litigation has already forced major and rapid concessions from the government: 350 people released from detention in the past week; an undertaking to proactively review the detention of all those held under immigration powers according to updated guidance and with a view to further significant releases; and a very strong presumption against any new detentions for people facing removal to around 50 countries.</p> <p>\u201cThe government has also been forced to issue new guidance on hygiene standards in detention and to accept that detention poses high risks to those with Covid-19-relevant underlying health conditions.</p> <p>\u201cWe will monitor the implementation of all these guarantees and continue to hold the government to account.\u201d</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe welcome the court\u2019s decision. Immigration Enforcement is responding to the unique circumstances of the coronavirus outbreak and following the latest guidance from Public Health England. The safety of detainees and staff is of vital importance.</p> <p>\u201cDecisions to detain are made on a case-by-case basis and kept under constant review, but our priority is to maintain the lawful detention of the most high-harm individuals, including foreign national offenders.\u2019\u2019</p>",
  "<p>A wearable spring-based contraption that attaches to the legs has the potential to boost human running speeds by 50%, according to researchers who hope to build the first prototype over the next year.</p> <p>Scientists came up with the concept after computer models showed that it was possible to dramatically increase the amount of energy people put into each running step by enabling them to do work when their feet are in the air.</p> <p>The device, which leads to what the researchers concede is an \u201cunconventional means of running\u201d, could set the stage for a new Olympic sport, they believe, and be adopted by police forces and emergency rescue teams. According to the scientists\u2019 calculations, if Usain Bolt mastered the contraption, his top speed would rocket from 27.8mph to nearly 50mph.</p> <p>\u201cWe wanted to see what physics allows and then explore it further by developing a device,\u201d said David Braun, an engineer who works on human augmentation at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.</p> <p>\u201cThis shows us how far we can push the boundaries and what key features we should focus on to develop the new technology.\u201d</p> <p>Braun hit on the idea after studying the mechanics of running and cycling. While the fastest human running speed on the flat is close to 28mph, the equivalent top cycling speed is nearer 50mph. Much of the difference is due to bicycles being in contact with the ground the whole time and the pedalling mechanism which allows the rider to power along constantly.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you look at world-record running, the foot is on the ground only 20% of the time, so for 80% of the time it is in the air and not providing any energy for motion,\u201d Braun said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96f81b14a549468275ec8228269944a9fa0a3a7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96f81b14a549468275ec8228269944a9fa0a3a7c/0_0_1692_741/1000.jpg\" alt=\"spring based running contraption\" width=\"1000\" height=\"438\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>What is needed, he <a href=\"https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/13/eaay1950\">reports in Science Advances</a>, is a way for runners to do work when their feet are off the ground.</p> <p>Braun and his colleagues used computer models to test a number of theoretical devices that took into account air resistance, the power limit of the human leg and the energy that is lost when the foot impacts the ground. They concluded that a spring-powered device that attached to the legs could give runners the boost they sought.</p> <p>The principle behind the device is to store energy by compressing a spring when the runner lifts and bends their trailing leg before they swing it forwards. When the leg moves forward, the spring is locked and remains compressed until the foot hits the ground. Only then is the energy released to power the runner forwards.</p> <p>\u201cThis allows runners to do work during the aerial phase of the running motion,\u201d Braun said. \u201cIt\u2019s the key to borrowing the benefits of cycling and using them in running.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/03/technology-2050-save-humanity-or-destroy-us\">Technology in 2050: will it save humanity \u2013 or destroy us?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A second requirement is for the springs to be \u201cprogrammable\u201d so that the stiffness can be increased as the runner picks up speed. This can be done with a mechanism that steadily shortens how much of the spring can be compressed, since shorter springs are stiffer than longer ones.</p> <p>The effect, Braun said, is comparable to the gears on a bike that are switched up as the cyclist rides faster.</p> <p>Just as ice-skating and cycling take time to grasp, so might the final contraption take some mastering, the researchers admit.</p> <p>And while Braun hopes to have a demonstration model finished in a year, it may take several more years of development to reach its full potential.</p> <p>\u201cAt the early stage, it will look like an exoskeleton, but in the later stages we hope it will look like a shoe,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to build a prototype but quite another to miniaturise it.\u201d</p>"
