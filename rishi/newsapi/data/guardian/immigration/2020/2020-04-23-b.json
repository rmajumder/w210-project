Research shows that remittances help alleviate poverty in lower- and middle-income (LCMI) countries, and are linked with reductions in malnutrition, child labour, and missed school in disadvantaged households.<br><br>The dramatic fall will be felt sharply after a record $554bn was sent to LMICs in remittances in 2019 - overtaking foreign investment for the first time. The latter is predicted to drop by a whopping 35% next year, which means the decline in weekly or monthly money transfers to struggling families in countries such as Guatemala, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, and Ukraine will hit communities hard. The unprecedented crash in crude oil prices will also add to the woes.<br><br>The biggest falls are expected in Europe and Central Asia (27.5%), followed by Sub-Saharan Africa (23.1%), South Asia (22.1%), the Middle East and North Africa (19.6%), Latin America and the Caribbean (19.3%), and East Asia and the Pacific (13%).<br><br>On the bright-ish side, the World Bank reckons that remittances will recover slightly by 2021, to rise by an estimated 5.6% to $470 billion. But - and there are a lot of buts - this depends on how the pandemic evolves across the globe during the rest of the year, and the measures implemented to mitigate the spread of the virus. Also, remittance flows are typically counter-cyclical, as migrant workers tend to send more money to their families in times of crisis and hardship back home. But, this pandemic is truly global, and so is the economic fall-out.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-23T19:49:17.299Z\">at 8.49pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea1ec508f08eb2f433f562f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jasonburke\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-23T19:34:25.542Z\">8.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Jason Burke</strong>, the Guardian\u2019s Africa correspondent, has written this dispatch on how <strong>South Africa</strong> will begin to ease its lockdown:</p> \n  <p>South Africa\u2019s president <strong>Cyril Ramaphosa</strong> spoke to the nation for the second time in three days on Thursday night, giving 56 million people the good news that the very strict lockdown that they have endured for nearly month would be lifted at the end of the month, but undoubtedly disappointing some by making it very clear that changes to the lives of many would not be substantial.</p> \n  <p>So far South Africa, which has been praised for its pro-active strategy of screening and testing to contain the Covid-19 virus, has nearly 4,000 confirmed cases and has suffered 75 deaths.

But from May 1st South Africa will move to level four, which will allow \u201csome activity to resume subject to extreme precautions\u201d. </p> \n  <p>Few further details were immediately available though Ramaphosa mentioned the phased reopening of schools. The country\u2019s borders will remain shut however. Level three would allow some social activities, but even level two would mean a continuing ban on religious services, sporting events, concerts, cinema and similar gatherings. </p> \n  <p>Ramaphosa stressed the risk of a new surge of infections, and though the president did not mention the coming winter, experts have repeatedly warned that the month ahead are likely to be difficult. Very significant restrictions look set to remain in place for six months at least. </p> \n  <p>\u201cLet us stay strong and united,\u201d Ramaphosa, a popular leader who took power in 2018 and won an election last year, said. <br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-23T19:37:04.367Z\">at 8.37pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea1e3698f08eb2f433f55eb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-23T19:24:41.881Z\">8.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Dubai</strong> has become the latest city to ease lockdown restrictions, announcing that cafes and restaurants are to reopen with a maximum capacity of 30 per cent. </p> \n  <p>Reuters reports public transportation services, including the subway, will resume from 26 April.

And amid a global pandemic, this year\u2019s month of fasting and reflection for the world\u2019s Muslims will be very different, writes <strong>Martin Chulov</strong>, the Guardian\u2019s Middle East editor.</p> \n  <p>Normally a sociable time, where abstaining from food and water during daylight hours gives way to sumptuous meals and gatherings at dusk, the 2020 rituals have been modified to fit public health directives that urge people to maintain a distance from each other while the coronavirus remains active. </p> \n  <p>Mosques will remain closed to evening prayers and feasting will become a more intimate affair, within the confines of family homes. Large public banquets, provided by authorities, or benefactors, have been outlawed in much of the Islamic world, where curfews and lockdowns remain rigidly enforced.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a06a0dd4eff7e5113090a2a67612eabcec73d27e\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a06a0dd4eff7e5113090a2a67612eabcec73d27e/0_0_2691_1815/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man uses a monocular during a gathering on the roof of Al Musariin mosque in Jakarta, Indonesia, to watch for the moon to mark the first day of Ramadan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"674\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man uses a monocular during a gathering on the roof of Al Musariin mosque in Jakarta, Indonesia, to watch for the moon to mark the first day of Ramadan</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Willy Kurniawan/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Ahead of the fast there was even discussion about whether going without sustenance for much of the day may have an effect on immunity \u2013 and hence people\u2019s capacity to fight off Covid-19. However, with no clarity about whether this is the case, and evidence to support the contrary \u2013 that fasting may in fact be beneficial \u2013 the premise of this year\u2019s Ramadan remains unchanged.</p> \n  <p>\u201cMuslim religious authorities around the world are advocating wide restrictions on gatherings, in or out of mosques, as a result of the corona pandemic,\u201d said Dr HA Hellyer, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cThe mosques will remain virtually closed; the usual charity meal tables will be absent from the streets; and the frequent family socialising associated with Ramadan will be suspended.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Ramadan under lockdown is the antithesis of the festival. But, as Covid-19 took hold in the lead up to the fast, religious authorities and governments remained determined to ban congregational activities \u2013 a move that could deny the impoverished more than the chance to socialise. Charity is also an important part of the month, with cash, food and other donations regularly given to those with few means to afford them.</p> \n  <p>Mosques across the Middle East and north Africa \u2013 in Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Jordan, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates \u2013 have largely been shuttered throughout the crisis and will not offer shelter or seclusion to those fasting this year. </p> \n  <p>Some regional states have amended their curfew times to make it easier for people to shop during fasting hours. Coronavirus has even taken a toll on traditional Ramadan TV fare, with social distancing disrupting filming in the run-up, leaving shows unfinished. Clerical bodies, meanwhile, have encouraged people to embrace this year\u2019s restrictions by focusing on close family members.</p> \n  <p>In a statement earlier this month, Egypt\u2019s Grand Mufti, Shawki Allam, said: \u201cWe must look to the positive aspects during these exceptional times that have compelled many people to be quarantined in their homes and turn this into an opportunity for bonding and forgiveness and restoring the spirit of serenity and cooperation.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-23T12:59:57.722Z\">at 1.59pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea180ea8f08a1178d5b0551\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-23T12:02:56.601Z\">1.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In most of the world, medical staff have been lauded as heroes for their response to the coronavirus pandemic.

He also said that children or adolescents with a fever or symptoms consistent with the coronavirus should stay at home in quarantine.</p> \n  <p>The deputy prime minister also asked children in Spain to forgive the confusion the government had caused on Tuesday after it said children would be allowed out only to accompany a parent to buy food or medicine. A huge public outcry resulted in a u-turn within hours, and the government insisting that children would have more room to roam.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI want to say sorry because over the past few days and hours, the government hasn\u2019t been as clear as it could have been when it came to explaining how you\u2019ll be allowed to go out for walks with your families from Sunday,\u201d said Iglesias. </p> \n  <p>\u201cI know this confinement hasn\u2019t been at all easy for you - you\u2019ve had to stop going to school and seeing your teachers and friends.

  "<p>The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/coronavirus-testing-to-be-offered-to-england-key-workers-and-families\">expanded the criteria</a> for who qualifies for a free test for coronavirus, so who will this include and how will the ramped-up testing regime work?</p> \n<h2><strong>Why is testing being expanded now?</strong></h2> \n<p>Hancock is desperate to meet a target for testing 100,000 people per day by Thursday 30 April but appears a long way off achieving that. On Wednesday there were only 23,560 tests, still below an interim target of 25,000 tests by the middle of April. The 100,000 target has been dismissed as arbitrary and overambitious, but Hancock is determined to meet it. He claims the criteria can be expanded because there is now greater capacity for testing but too few people have been coming forward for tests. These would be tests for whether people currently have the virus, not antibody tests to show if people have previously been infected.</p> \n<h2><strong>Is there capacity to test 100,000 people a day?</strong></h2> \n<p>Not yet, but Hancock claims the government is on course to meet the target in terms of capacity, if not the tests themselves. On Thursday he said capacity had increased overnight from 40,000 to 51,000 tests, which he claimed was ahead of schedule.</p> \n<h2><strong>Will more than 100,000 tests eventually be available?</strong></h2> \n<p>Yes, according to Hancock. \u201cOur ultimate goal is that everyone who could benefit from a test gets a test,\u201d he said.</p> \n<h2><strong>Who previously qualified for a test?</strong></h2> \n<p>Initially only patients in hospital could get tests. When Hancock pledged the 100,000 target by the end of April, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/matt-hancock-sets-target-of-100000-coronavirus-tests-a-day\">he also announced plans to test NHS staff</a>. Later he broadened the criteria to include care home staff.</p> \n<h2><strong>Who now qualifies for tests?</strong></h2> \n<p>Up to 10 million essential workers and their families in England who are showing symptoms of coronavirus. The list of essential workers is the same as the one used to allow the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-maintaining-educational-provision/guidance-for-schools-colleges-and-local-authorities-on-maintaining-educational-provision\">children of key workers</a> to carry on going to school during the lockdown. In addition to health and social care staff, the list includes teachers, judges, some lawyers, religious staff, and journalists providing public service broadcasting. Also included are local civil servants, police, armed service personnel, fire and rescue service staff, immigration officers and prison and probation staff. Some private-sector staff also qualify including vets, those in food production, essential financial services and information technology, as well as those working in the oil, gas, electricity and water sectors.</p> \n<h2><strong>How do you apply?</strong></h2> \n<p>Employers of essential workers will be able to apply on the government\u2019s website to get a test for any of their staff. From Friday any essential workers who need a test will be able to book an appointment on the website themselves. Hancock said: \u201cThis also applies for people in essential workers\u2019 households too who need a test.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/coronavirus-uk-how-many-confirmed-cases-in-my-area\">Coronavirus UK: how many confirmed cases are there in my area?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong>What happens after you apply?</strong></h2> \n<p>After entering your details on the government website, essential workers will then get a text or an email inviting them for an appointment. After taking a test, results will be sent out by text or email within about two days. Those testing positive with mild symptoms will be expected to follow the government\u2019s isolation guidelines.</p> \n<h2><strong>Where will tests take place?</strong></h2> \n<p>There are regional test sites in around 30 locations across England, with more planned. The army will be providing mobile testing sites in more remote areas. And Hancock also promised home testing kits.</p>",

Shopping in physical stores, recreational activities, personal services, and a long list of other types of spending have been sharply reduced.</p> <p>As a result, the businesses that normally provide these goods and services have sharply reduced activity, or shut down entirely.

  "<h2><strong>\u2018A VISION THAT NO ONE ELSE HAS\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Given the team\u2019s dismal form of late, news that Big Phil Neville <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/22/phil-neville-to-step-down-as-england-womens-manager-next-summer-before-euro-2022-olympics\">is to step down</a> as England Women\u2019s manager when his contract expires next summer \u2013 and not therefore guide the team at the rearranged European Championship in 2022 \u2013 hardly comes as a surprise.

It began with Neville having to apologise for some sexist tweets and explain away the unavoidable sense that \u2013 given his coaching CV consisted of spells with the wildly successful Manchester United of David Moyes and the runaway train of trophy success that was Gary Neville\u2019s Valencia, not to mention the triumphant England Under-21 side at Euro 2013 who definitely didn\u2019t finish bottom of their group having scored once and lost all three games at the finals \u2013 his key qualification for the job was that he was A Famous England Men\u2019s Footballer rather than an exceptional managerial talent.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/22/phil-neville-to-step-down-as-england-womens-manager-next-summer-before-euro-2022-olympics\">Phil Neville to step down as England Women's manager next summer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And at first \u2013 some distinctly Brentian verbiage aside \u2013 he seemed to be steering things calmly out of the post-Sampson malaise. A first SheBelieves Cup success is not to be sniffed at and your view of the 2019 World Cup campaign may depend on your perspective, but a last-four exit against inarguably the best team in the world is a fair effort. If nothing else, his side added another memorable chapter to England\u2019s Big Book of World Cup Semi-Final Heartbreak \u2013 inspirational-captain-misses-late-late-penalty-clanger was a very fine addition to the ever-expanding canon even if 2015\u2019s added-time-own-goal-catastrophe will take some beating. </p> <p>But plenty of managers have learned over the years that no one is too fussed about your odd pronouncements as long as you\u2019re winning. However, offering \u201cI have a vision that no one else has, I\u2019ve got bravery that no other coach has, so thank your lucky stars\u201d after a limp defeat against Norway that has extended your winless run to four games just makes you sound slightly unhinged. \u201cI know if they go to the cinema \u2013 it\u2019s the detail you need to be successful,\u201d he said of his squad in 2018. \u201cIf they have an ice cream I know about it.\u201d Which was all very well at the time, but when you\u2019ve won three in 11 people start to wonder if keeping track of whether Millie Bright had been to see the latest Avengers or if Toni Duggan has had a hankering for a Raspberry Mivvi were really such vital metrics after all.</p> <p>Perhaps most damagingly, describing a third-place play-off you\u2019ve just lost as \u201ca nonsense game\u201d when half your squad are, quite rightly, extremely proud of the 2015 bronze medals they\u2019ve got at home, is not the hottest of takes.

Getting lost on the way to the ground would prove a fairly accurate precursor to the day as a whole. Even when we took a 1-0 first-half lead, I was punched in the eye during our celebrations by my overexcited friend Mark. Our team rolled over abjectly after half-time, losing 2-1 to a team of 10 men with nothing to play for, and went down on goal difference. On the train home I got drunk alone on terrible lager and tried to cheer myself up by chatting to some other passengers, only to be utterly humiliated by their response.

  "<p>The coronavirus pandemic will trigger \u201clasting changes\u201d in shopping behaviour, according to one of the world\u2019s biggest manufacturers of grocery brands.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/unilever\">Unilever</a>\u2019s chief executive, Alan Jope, said the health crisis would accelerate the growth of online food shopping. He also predicted a permanent increase in demand for soap and other cleaning supplies as improved hygiene became a priority for households.</p> <p>\u201cI think we will be able to look back and see this as a point of inflection for online grocery shopping,\u201d he said. \u201cGood luck getting an appointment for a grocery delivery. I think that will persist and we will adjust our approach to reflect that.\u201d</p> <p>In the coming months, people would want to wash their hands more and be concerned about surface hygiene in homes, Jope added. \u201cThe whole hygiene thing will carry on.\u201d</p> <p>Unilever, which owns more than 400 brands, was updating investors after a torrid three months in which the business experienced seesawing levels of demand. While shoppers filled kitchen cupboards with jars of the group\u2019s Hellman\u2019s mayonnaise, Pot Noodles and Cif surface spray, the lockdown forced consumers to cut back on products such as Cornetto and Magnum ice-cream, which are reliant on sales to the cafe and restaurant trade.</p> <p>The shift to home working had also sapped demand for grooming products such as shampoo and deodorant, with Jope conceding that people \u201cshaving a bit less\u201d was hitting demand for razors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unilever rang up sales of \u20ac12.4bn in first three months of 2020, level with a year ago and short of analyst expectations. In common with other companies, the Anglo-Dutch group withdrew its financial guidance as it navigated its way through what Jope described as a \u201chuman crisis\u201d.</p> <p>Demand for its cleaning and hygiene products, such as Cif and Domestos bleach, jumped more than 10% in the first three months of 2020, resulting in an overall 2.4% increase in its homecare sales. However, the collapse in demand for ice-cream put a drag on food sales, which fell 1.7% after orders from traditional tourist hotspots did not materialise, given the uncertain outlook going into the holiday season.</p> <p>The company was not tapping the government for financial support, Jope said. \u201cWe think that the government schemes to protect jobs and people\u2019s livelihoods are intended for small businesses and sectors that are more under threat than Unilever\u2019s,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t think is intended for companies like ours; we would rather keep our destiny in our own hands.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>When the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price for May futures contracts \u2013 an agreement to buy or sell the commodity at a predetermined price at a specified future date \u2013 tumbled to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/oil-prices-sink-to-20-year-low-as-un-sounds-alarm-on-to-covid-19-relief-fund\">-$38 a barrel</a>, the Covid-19 economic crisis appeared to have taken a turn to the surreal. Traders, some of whom buy oil not to use but as a financial asset, were paying people to take oil from them because only a few had the capacity to take delivery in <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil-usa-storage/no-vacancy-main-us-oil-storage-in-cushing-is-all-booked-idUSKCN22332W\">Cushing, Oklahoma</a>, where storage space is virtually full.</p> <p>What happened in oil trading on Monday 20 April was an epiphenomenon conjured by oil as a financial commodity. Nobody thought that oil demand had permanently cratered, and indeed the WTI price for June delivery stayed just above <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52350082\">$20 a barrel</a>, as did the price of Brent crude, the benchmark for European, Middle Eastern and African oil.</p> <p>However, this does not mean there isn\u2019t trouble brewing in the oil markets, and as a result, for the rest of us. Even at the June price, the going rate is dangerously low. For the past few years, a worldwide oversupply means oil has been sold too cheaply for producers to extract oil profitably or finance petrostates, such as Saudi Arabia. This was the outcome of an overshoot in the industry as US producers sought to frack shale oil. This made up for a previous undersupply in global markets, but ensured that by 2014, the addition of shale to the conventional oil supplied by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and Russia had produced a glut.</p> <p>When too many producers wish to sell too much oil, they engage in a destructive race to the bottom. When that price reaches a crisis point, it is in the producer states\u2019 interests to cooperate to constrain supply to force prices back up. This dynamic is what pushed Saudi Arabia and Russia to form a reluctant alliance in November 2016 in what became known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/30/russia-saudi-arabia-extend-deal-opec-oil-output\">Opec+</a>. But Saudi-Russian cooperation also allowed American shale companies to freeride on higher prices.</p> <p>After the US <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-50875935\">slapped sanctions on Moscow</a> over the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline \u2013 a project that would allow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/25/nord-stream-2-russian-gas-pipeline-likely-to-go-ahead-after-eu-deal\">Russia to export more gas to Germany</a> \u2013 at the end of last year, Vladimir Putin became increasingly reluctant to facilitate US freeriding by cutting Russian output.</p> <p>As Covid-19 hit and the global economy started to grind to a halt, Opec+ came apart. It seems that when Putin refused to cut production to stabilise prices, Mohammed bin Salman decided to flood the market instead to procure a bigger market share. Given<em> </em>that demand was evaporating<em>, </em>this was<em> </em>a spectacular misjudgment by the Saudi crown prince, and it caused <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/mar/09/markets-plunge-crash-financial-crisis-coronavirus-ftse-italy-oil-price-dow-business-live\">share and bond markets to crash</a> during the week beginning 9 March.</p> <p>If the collapse in the May contract on 20 April was a transitory illustration of the problems in oil markets, the fact that 2022 futures prices for that day were not much above $30 emphatically does not bode well. Oil needs to be expensive enough to cover the costs of production,<strong> </strong>and in the case of American shale oil to service the debt sustaining the sector.<strong> </strong>Without higher prices there will be insufficient supply to restore growth, and oil will cause cascading defaults across credit markets that will risk another banking crisis. The Mexican state oil company, Pemex, is already reeling under a debt crisis, and the credit rating agency Moody\u2019s has <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-pemex-moody-s/moodys-says-pemex-debt-makes-it-hard-to-recover-investment-grade-idUSKBN2222KN\">this week downgraded</a> Mexico\u2019s sovereign debt because of Pemex\u2019s woes.</p> <p>The bad news for those who think the collapse in oil prices is good for the climate is that our financial markets, economies and politics are inescapably intertwined with oil, and the oil industry is in trouble. There can be no rapid transition to a green economy because there are not yet sufficient alternative energy sources to replace the volume of economic and daily activity that oil powers. It is quite possible that oil demand will not hit 100m barrels per day again for a long time, if ever. But there will be no beginning to an economic recovery from the global shutdown that does not involve consumers buying more expensive oil and oil-dependent goods. </p> <p><br>\u2022 Helen Thompson is professor of political economy at Cambridge University<br></p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump has inevitably made coronavirus about immigration. \u201cIn light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1252418369170501639\">Trump </a>tweeted, \u201cI will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States!\u201d Nativism renders this \u201cinvisible enemy\u201d visible in the form of human beings who can be painted as a threat and blamed for our problems.</p> <p>Staff then rushed to draft an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/us/politics/coronavirus-immigration-green-cards.html\">executive order</a> that comports with Trump\u2019s tweet. But travel bans already covered Europe and China, land borders with Mexico and Canada were mostly closed, unauthorized border crossers were automatically deported, refugee resettlement was globally suspended, and ordinary visa processing was frozen. That\u2019s on top of Trump\u2019s prior banning of people from Muslim-majority and African countries, slashing refugee admissions, and forcing asylum seekers to remain in Mexico. Immigration had already been all but halted.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nativism has always thrived by providing visible substitutes for 'invisible enemies'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It turns out, however, that exceptions will be made for guest workers. That\u2019s because nativism have always run up against business\u2019 demand for labor. This emergency, however, could reset the contours of that debate, just as the first world war-era red scare weakened business opposition to restriction, facilitating the passage of the national origins quotas, which sharply limited immigration along brazenly racist lines from the 1920s through 1965. This is the golden age that nativists like Stephen Miller take inspiration from.</p> <p>Trump is moving to hermetically seal the country, making real the fantastic promise of his pledged \u201cimpenetrable WALL\u201d. What ordinary politics could not secure, a global pandemic has delivered: a nativist, if temporary and ad hoc, fever dream. It could get much worse, and more permanent, too.</p> <p>Coronavirus has accelerated the dynamics that enabled Trump\u2019s nativist presidency and the global rise of the far right. The countries that long benefited from global dominance have for decades failed to broadly redistribute empire\u2019s benefits to their citizens: neoliberalism decimated worker power, stagnated wages, and funeled wealth to the richest. The same geopolitics that delivered such massive wealth and power to the global north also led to the mass arrival of migrants. Without a powerful left, nativist nationalism is the interpretative frame that won out. Nativism has always thrived by providing visible substitutes for \u201cinvisible enemies,\u201d from the abstract violence of global capitalism to the US empire raging against its unexpected limits.</p> <p>Since the Clinton administration, business has been content with a bipartisan war on \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d and the militarization of the border as long <em>legal</em> immigration remained untouched. While Trump has failed to secure legislative cuts to legal immigration, he has done a lot to restrict it administratively. Covid-19 provides him with incredible new opportunities. But the guest worker exemption shows that business still wields ample power in the conservative coalition, and that racist and culture war policy must bend to the profit imperative.</p> <p>Trump and his allies have celebrated the ban in the language of rightwing populism, emphasizing its purported economic benefits for working-class Americans. In court, however, the executive order will likely be defended on the same national security grounds that were successfully marshalled to defend the Muslim ban, this time under the guise of the nation\u2019s public health.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The pandemic, of course, has exposed the inescapability of human sociality and proven the libertarian premise that every man is an island to be a lie</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The pandemic, of course, has exposed the inescapability of human sociality and proven the libertarian premise that every man is an island to be a lie. Nationalism\u2019s promise to protect Americans behind secure borders has likewise been shown to be empty: as long as coronavirus exists in one place it threatens every place. But contrary evidence has never easily demolished powerful ideologies.</p> <p>Instead, the trajectory of the pandemic will, if left unchecked, reaffirm the very status quo that is facilitating its spread. The same global inequalities that drive immigration and facilitate the xenophobic response to it could create a situation where the virus is tamed in the global north while it ravages the global south. Massive outbreaks in poor countries could then lead to this temporary shutdown in human movement transitioning into a more permanent system that locks much of the poor world behind a massive cordon sanitaire.</p> <p>If Trump\u2019s suspension of immigration survives legal challenge, creating this new multi-tiered system of travel and immigration restriction will only require that he selectively lift bans on particular countries. Declaring wealthy countries as \u201ccorona-free\u201d would provide a facially non-discriminatory public health pretext for enacting a fundamentally racist program. The only way to exit the nativist hellscape is to fight for a redistribution of the resources that the global south needs to fight the pandemic. The struggle against the xenophobic far-right is now also fundamentally a fight for a globally just response to Covid-19, including massive debt relief. The solution to a global pandemic must be global in scope. If it\u2019s not, Trump\u2019s makeshift solution will be to further split the world into pieces.</p>",

I think we were in about 24 hours before the United States, but we made the decision about the same time and it was the extraordinary discipline of our Chinese Australian community, which meant that we resisted that first wave of cases. The wave of cases that impacted Australia came from predominantly returning Australians from other parts of the world, where the virus had transmitted to out of China. <br></p> \n   <p>What\u2019s important is that we work together in a transparent way.

Our purpose here is just pretty simple: we\u2019d like the world to be safer when it comes to viruses. It seems like a pretty honest ambition that I\u2019m sure most people in the world would agree with.

  "<p>The dormitories in which Singapore\u2019s migrant workers live have, until recently, been almost hidden from view. The vast, steel buildings are mostly on the outskirts of town, tucked inside industrial estates, far away from the city-state\u2019s glittering skyscrapers and luxury hotels.</p> \n<p>Inside, the men who carry out backbreaking work to build Singapore\u2019s infrastructure, sleep on bunk beds, crammed into rooms with as many as 20 people.

Singapore, <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.20022707v1.full.pdf\">recently lauded</a> for its gold-standard approach to testing and tracing, now demonstrates both the dangers of neglecting marginalised communities, and the vulnerability of nations to a second wave of infections.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/singapores-cramped-migrant-worker-dorms-hide-covid-19-surge-risk\">Singapore's cramped migrant worker dorms hide Covid-19 surge risk</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>On Wednesday, the number of cases surpassed 10,000. This compares with just 200 infections recorded on 15 March, when its outbreak appeared to be nearly under control. Almost all new reports involve migrant workers.</p> \n<p>Last week, the country extended a partial shutdown that was introduced at the start of April, with people told to stay indoors as much as possible. All migrant workers have been told not to leave their dorms, and are instead having food delivered by authorities.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt feels like we\u2019re in a prison. [It is] too difficult. [There is] too much heat in the room,\u201d says A, who asked to remain anonymous, fearing that he might face repercussions for speaking to the media.

The country acted quickly to minimise the risk of transmission: border restrictions were introduced, an exhaustive contract-tracing programme rolled out and a home quarantine system was strictly enforced. Tests were also made free for all. The country, which avoided sweeping shutdown measures throughout March, appeared to have contained the virus.</p> \n<p>But rights groups say little attention was paid to migrant workers who, despite the pandemic, continued to live in close quarters, and spent hours a day travelling on the back of crowded lorries to get to and from construction sites. \u201cThe way the workers were stacked in [on the back of lorries], it was like the way goats are stacked in when they are taken to a slaughter house,\u201d says B, a second worker, who also asked to be anonymous.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Activists say they raised concerns about the risks posed by the virus to migrant workers as early as February. In March, the campaign group Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2) said <a href=\"http://twc2.org.sg/2020/03/23/straits-times-forum-employers-practices-leave-foreign-workers-vulnerable-to-infection/\">the risk of an outbreak among this community was \u201cundeniable\u201d</a>.</p> \n<h2>Inequality laid bare</h2> \n<p>When clusters began to emerge, the government moved 7,000 workers, mostly people who do essential jobs such as working on power plants, out of the buildings. About 293,000 remain housed in such facilities. Authorities say they will prioritise relocating older people. Cleaning services have been increased to improve hygiene, officials say, and meals are also being delivered to prevent workers needing to use communal kitchens.</p> \n<p>The outbreak has brought to the surface the glaring inequality in Singapore, which relies heavily on a workforce of about a million migrant workers to build its famous skyscrapers, and clean its gleaming shopping malls. Most have travelled to the country from Bangladesh, India and other south Asian countries, in the hope of sending money back home. Their lifestyles are a stark contrast to the country\u2019s wealthy elite and financial workers.</p> \n<p>Kokila Annamalai, a local activist who supports migrant workers, fears that the spread of Covid-19 within the dormitories has fanned the flames of xenophobia and racism. She points to comments made online and in the media. \u201cOn top of [the view that] \u2018it\u2019s their fault for not being clean and for their eating habits\u2019 and things like that, there is also this almost worse mindset of \u2018they\u2019re driving our numbers up and it makes us look bad on the world stage, and they should go home\u2019,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>While such remarks have been condemned by Singapore\u2019s home affairs and law minister, Kasiviswanathan Shanmugam, campaigners say official messages have also been unhelpful. Workers have been urged to \u201cbe responsible\u201d, wear face masks at all times, report symptoms to their dormitory operators and stay at least one metre from one another.</p> \n<p>A recent study by Mohan Dutta, a professor at Massey University in New Zealand, suggests such guidance is often just impractical. The overwhelming majority of about 100 workers surveyed said they were unable to maintain such a distance at all times. More than half described their rooms as unhygienic.</p> \n<p>Just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/singapores-cramped-migrant-worker-dorms-hide-covid-19-surge-risk\">last week</a>, workers reported that they did not have enough soap to wash their hands.</p> \n<h2>\u2018I had no idea I would have to live like this\u2019</h2> \n<p>Workers are generally reluctant to voice complaints. Most take out huge debts in order to work in Singapore, often to find on arrival that they will be paid less than promised. A typical salary is around S$500-750 (\u00a3285-\u00a3425) a month. They are required to hold temporary work permits, but these are tied to their employer, making them extremely vulnerable to exploitation.</p> \n<p>B sold his family land and took loans so he could afford to pay an agency about S$7,000 to work in Singapore, where he hoped he would earn a high salary. As the eldest son, he is responsible for supporting his extended family, as well as his own wife and children. He knew that he would be required to work hard in Singapore, but his body was unprepared for the long hours of heavy lifting on construction sites. He did not expect that he would live, initially, in a container with eight others. \u201c[I] had no idea that I would have to live like this and be in this much pain,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8d01dce0d52080a96cffc9955df7ec657cff8e7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8d01dce0d52080a96cffc9955df7ec657cff8e7/0_65_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Singapore\u2019s skyscrapers were built on migrant labour.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Singapore\u2019s skyscrapers were built on migrant labour.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Edgar Su/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Now, about a decade later, he says he is at least lucky to share a dorm room with just 12 people \u2013 fewer than many of his peers, and a contrast to his previous room, which had virtually no natural light. A also shares a room with 12 others. The heat is so suffocating, that everyone sleeps on the floor, he says. He is afraid to use the communal toilets, which are unclean.</p> \n<p>Many in Singapore are sympathetic towards the workers. \u201cThey deserve more. They deserve what every Singaporean deserves,\u201d says William Lai, a photographer. \u201cI don\u2019t know what is going through the minds of these people [who blame workers] ... It is not their fault. They don\u2019t want to be affected by this.\u201d</p> \n<p>In a speech this week, Singapore\u2019s prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, said migrant workers would be cared for in the same way as Singaporeans: \u201cWe will look after your health, your welfare and your livelihood.\u201d Almost all the migrant workers infected have only mild symptoms, he added.</p> \n<p>Dutta believes the crisis could present an opportunity to reform how migrant workers are treated, but he added that small tweaks would not be enough. \u201cSubstantive changes are needed in how Singapore looks at migrant workers, what rights migrant workers have, and how they are able to advocate for their own health and wellbeing,\u201d says Dutta.</p> \n<p>B says that, for a start, migrant worker dormitories should be more strictly controlled, with caps on the number of workers allowed per room and per bathroom facilities. \u201cIt is not like Singapore cannot regulate it.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cThis entire city is built on our labour and on our hard work,\u201d he adds. \u201cThat tells you what you need to be told about the culture that we bring, and how our culture makes up the clean and sparkling facade of the city.\u201d</p> \n<p>Workers, he adds, do not expect special kindness, just their basic labour rights.</p> \n<p><em>Additional reporting by Redwan Ahmed</em></p>",

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/08-04-2020-who-timeline---covid-19\">The dates</a> are by now well-rehearsed. 31 December: China informs the World Health Organisation that cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause have been detected in Wuhan. 20 January: human-to-human transmission is confirmed. 24 January: scientists publish <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext\">an article in the Lancet </a>noting the coronavirus\u2019s \u201cpandemic potential\u201d. 9 March: Italy imposes a national quarantine and enters lockdown. To this list of key moments, we can now add 24 March: Slavoj \u017di\u017eek\u2019s publisher announces that he has written a book about coronavirus.</p> <p>That\u2019s roughly 100 days between the outbreak of Covid-19 and \u017di\u017eek firing up the presses. It\u2019s an impressive feat, and for a prolific philosopher-provocateur known for his use of humour, feels like it was designed to be the punchline to a gag: what reproduces itself more quickly, the coronavirus or the commentary?</p> <p>But <em>Pandemic!: Covid-19 Shakes the World</em> is thin on humour. In fact, \u017di\u017eek wonders aloud whether he should exercise caution with his distinctive flights of conceptual fancy, given his \u201c(as yet) safe external position\u201d from the widespread suffering. He doesn\u2019t. Over the course of the short book, he enlists those typically \u017di\u017eekian thinkers and tactics \u2013 Hegel, Lacan, an analogy for capitalism\u2019s health derived from Quentin Tarantino\u2019s <em>Kill Bill</em> \u2013 to form 10 impressionistic chapters. Each circles a different subject, very occasionally landing on the thesis: a \u201cnew form of what was once called communism\u201d is needed to avoid this pandemic resolving into a global nightmare.</p> <p>The opening gambit is to use Jesus Christ\u2019s injunction on resurrection to Mary \u2013 \u201cTouch me not\u201d \u2013 to explain how social distancing can underwrite solidarity. \u017di\u017eek describes himself as a \u201cChristian atheist\u201d, so it\u2019s not a surprising start and is also a little too neat. An odd chapter on \u201cPutogan\u201d, a portmanteau of Russia and Turkey\u2019s leaders, allows him to write about the refugee crisis, oddly implying that it is the main challenge facing European \u201coperational unity\u201d during the pandemic. \u201cPolitical correctness\u201d, one of the philosopher\u2019s bugbears, is mentioned twice. It\u2019s hard to shake off a sense that \u017di\u017eek, with the speed and efficiency of a just-in-time production line, has simply corralled events into a shape that fits his pre-existing interests and logical operations.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>\u017di\u017eek powerfully makes the point that the moral task during this pandemic is to alleviate suffering, not to 'economise'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is nothing inherently wrong with that. But what in the book works? There is a nice passage that counters the view that humanity is being \u201cpunished\u201d by this epidemic for exploiting the natural world. \u017di\u017eek thinks that such arguments have a reassuring function, since they assume that humans \u201cmatter in some profound way\u201d; the really difficult thing to accept is that this \u201cstupid self-replicating mechanism\u201d, as he describes the virus, \u201chides no deeper meaning\u201d. He is at his most powerful \u2013 useful, even \u2013 when simply pointing out that the moral task during this pandemic is to alleviate suffering, not to \u201ceconomise\u201d. There is something profoundly radical in the way states have adhered to this anti-economistic logic by locking down, and the temptation to return to \u201cnormal\u201d at the expense of the sick must be resisted.</p> <p>That said, \u017di\u017eek has an inner liberal that stops him from praising China\u2019s leaders \u2013 pioneers of the lockdown \u2013 for their handling of the crisis. He endorses journalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/verna-yu\">Verna Yu</a>\u2019s comment that \u201cif China valued free speech, there would be no coronavirus crisis\u201d, in reference to the muzzling of whistleblowers. This disguises an inconvenient truth: as the months pass, China will likely emerge as the most effective superpower at dealing with the pandemic; the comparison with the poorly organised systems centred in Washington and Brussels is already stark. A crisis of legitimacy will follow and in anticipation of this \u2013 to find a way out of the binary between an incompetent western barbarism and ruthlessly efficient eastern totalitarianism \u2013 \u017di\u017eek plumbs the present to find the unfolding of a latent \u201ccommunism\u201d.</p> <p>When \u017di\u017eek uses the term \u201ccommunism\u201d he is not talking about the \u201cold-style\u201d states of the 20th century, he tells us, but the necessity for a \u201cglobal organisation that can control and regulate the economy as well as limit the sovereignty of nation states when needed\u201d, and a coordinated shift away from the market. He sees stirrings of this in the massive mobilisation of state resources to pay private sector wages, nationalise services and direct industrial production.</p> <p>When Donald Trump is issuing cheques to millions of Americans, and a Conservative British government is effectively <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/29/northern-rail-franchise-to-be-renationalised\">nationalising the railways</a>, old orthodoxies melt into air. And what further encourages \u017di\u017eek is that this newfound solidarity is not based on leftwing idealistic sloganeering, but bare necessity. In Israel, the prime minister Benjamin<strong> </strong>Netanyahu \u201cimmediately offered help and coordination to the Palestinian authorities\u201d to fight coronavirus because, as \u017di\u017eek puts it, \u201cif one group is affected, the other will inevitably also suffer\u201d. Communism is the translation of this epidemiological reality into a durable politics.</p> <p>Though this is interesting, it\u2019s an image of communism that lacks a central scene: the fate of the working class. In the global south, where most of the world\u2019s labourers live, millions find themselves desperate and immediately without income. In countries where there are fewer ventilators than cabinet members, where social distancing in crowded slums is impossible, where debt repayments to western creditors are set to rise, where there are no powerful central banks to issue bonds that investors will trust, \u017di\u017eek\u2019s \u201ccommunism\u201d means little. And contrary to his sketch of the situation in Israel, reports show Palestinians are worried about coronavirus overwhelming the West Bank after one sick labourer was \u201cunceremoniously dumped\u201d at the border by Israeli police. Israel has also linked the political conditions of returning captured soldiers to any future coronavirus-aid to Gaza, Reuters reports. It turns out the logic of domination trumps even the rationalism of \u201cbiological\u201d solidarity.</p> <p>\u017di\u017eek has spent his career writing in anticipation of a world-historic moment like the coronavirus pandemic, a truly totalising event that would allow the Hegelian philosopher \u2013 Hegel\u2019s being a totalising philosophy \u2013 to deploy his skills on the frontline. But this first attempt from our philosophical key-worker is forgettable. It\u2019s frustrating, because there are moments when his analysis would be clearly useful, as when he asks: \u201cWhere does data end and ideology begin?\u201d It\u2019s a vital question as we spend our days glued to fatality graphs, but he doesn\u2019t answer it. That, as he argues, \u201cthe virus hides no deeper meaning\u201d must be a chilling prospect indeed.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Pandemic!: Covid-19 Shakes the World by Slavoj \u017di\u017eek is published by OR Books and is available from <a href=\"http://www.orbooks.com/\">www.orbooks.com</a></em></p>",

  "<p>In a typical election year, canvassers across the country would be beginning to fan out on street corners, college campuses, concerts and rallies to pepper Americans with a simple question: \u201cAre you registered to vote?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/22/coronavirus-us-jails-incarceration-death-toll-study\">Mass incarceration could add 100,000 deaths to US coronavirus toll, study finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This early work is critical to campaigns trying to build a support base for election day. But this year, the Covid-19 pandemic has made it nearly impossible to register new voters.</p> <p>Limited voter registration is most likely to affect young people, minority groups, and naturalized immigrants, groups projected to contribute to record-high turnout in November. Freezing them out is likely to benefit Republicans, who tend to see a more diverse and younger electorate as a threat.</p> <p>In Kentucky, where Mitch McConnell faces a closely-watched Senate re-election battle in November, <a href=\"https://kentucky.gov/Pages/Activity-stream.aspx?n=SOS&amp;prId=309\">just 504</a> people registered in March as Covid-19 restrictions went in to effect. By comparison, more than 7,200 voters registered the month before.</p> <p>Meanwhile, more states are turning to vote-by-mail amid the pandemic, relying on voter registration rolls to send out election materials. Those unable to register might not get their applications, or ballots, in time .</p> <p>\u201cWe are going to be in a position where folks who are eligible will not be brought into our electoral process unless states are proactive about this,\u201d said Myrna P\u00e9rez, director of the voting rights and elections program at the Brennan Center for Justice.</p> <p>That\u2019s especially important in key swing states, where elections are won by slim margins.</p> <p>It is almost impossible, for example, to register to vote in New Hampshire right now. The swing state is <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/electronic-or-online-voter-registration.aspx\">one of a handful</a> that doesn\u2019t let voters register online. The local election offices are closed. Last week, state officials said anyone fearful of the virus could register to vote <a href=\"http://x\">by mail</a> \u2013 but the process is complicated.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I called my city clerk\u2019s office, she said, \u2018Well, once Covid-19 is over, you can register to vote,\u2019\u201d said Olivia Zink, the executive director of Open Democracy, a civic action group. It could be several more months before offices fully reopen.</p> <p>Many of the missing voters may be young people. Voters aged 18 to 23 are expected to be <a href=\"https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/essay/an-early-look-at-the-2020-electorate/\">10% of all eligible voters</a> this year \u2013 a larger proportion than in 2016. But they may also be first-time voters, unfamiliar with how to register.</p> <p>Activists say states like Texas, which like New Hampshire has no online registration, make it even harder for this group.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Republicans feel power shifting out. The floor\u2019s falling out from beneath them</p> <footer> <cite>Luke Warford</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cOur state is living in an outdated political process. And that political process is strategically disenfranchising a new wave of voters,\u201d said Antonio Arellano, the interim executive director of Jolt, a Texas advocacy group that targets young Latino voters. \u201cSome of them may fall through the cracks.\u201d</p> <p>Texas is also projected to become majority Hispanic by 2022, and Republicans fear those changes will hurt their electoral chances, said Luke Warford, voter expansion director for the Texas Democratic party.</p> <p>\u201cRepublicans feel power shifting out. The floor\u2019s falling out from beneath them,\u201d he said. </p> <p>On Tuesday, Texas Democrats announced a new <a href=\"https://www.texasdemocrats.org/are-you-registered-to-vote/\">website</a> where voters can input their voter registration and have filled-out documents sent to them with prepaid envelopes. The party is aiming to register more than 1 million new voters.</p> <p>Such strategies could be essential to registering voters en masse since a many voters register at motor vehicle offices, or DMVs, which are now closed. <a href=\"https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/eac_assets/1/6/2018_EAVS_Report.pdf\">Over 35 million people</a> registered to vote at DMVs between 2016 and 2018 \u2013 45% of the registrations submitted.</p> <p>The closure of these offices has also made it more difficult to get the identification required in many states to vote. VoteRiders, a group that assists people in getting IDs, has been left helping people obtain the documents they need when the offices eventually open, said Laina Reynolds Levy, a spokesperson.</p> <p>Newly naturalized immigrants, another important voting bloc, may also be disenfranchised this year. US Citizen and Immigration Services cancelled citizenship oath ceremonies and in-person interviews, which could leave about 441,000 nearly naturalized citizens unable to vote in November, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/coronavirus-may-stop-hundreds-thousands-becoming-citizens-time-vote-november-n1178541\">according to NBC News</a>.</p> <p>With government offices closed, registering voters will depend even more on advocacy groups, which are now organizing online and unable to knock on doors or develop trust in person.</p> <p>Those interactions are critical when reaching out to communities targeted by voter suppression that tend to be skeptical of government, said Charlane Oliver, co-founder and co-executive director of the Equity Alliance, a Tennessee group focused on black voters.</p> <p>In recent years, Oliver\u2019s group has met voters at places like laundromats and nightclubs \u2013 something they can\u2019t do now.

In this sad, beautiful story of self-recovery, the writer found his piece of paradise with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/apr/17/pakistan-taliban-hindu-kush\">Kalash people in the Hindu Kush</a> in north-west Pakistan, having followed in the footsteps of Peachey and Daniel from Rudyard Kipling\u2019s The Man Who Would be King. The Kalash are the last people in the Hindu Kush who continue to practise their ancient pagan religion in the valleys of Bumburet, Birir and Rumbur. They look almost European, possibly descended from Alexander the Great. I wanted to meet them. Having travelled through beautiful Pakistan in 1995 I returned in 2015 and, travelling through some adventurous terrain and situations, also found that piece of paradise.

Gregory David Roberts imbues the narrative with a real sense of place. It is a novel about Bombay (now Mumbai) as much as it is about the storyline and colourful characters he creates. Lin, the narrator, arrives in Bombay on the run using a false passport and makes friends with Prabaker, a local. Together they enter the hidden world of the city\u2019s slums and mingle with down-and-outs and reprobates. Lin and his friends meet at the Leopold Cafe \u2013 and I just had to visit the cafe when I eventually got to Mumbai!

  "<p>You probably think you know the story of One Hundred and One Dalmatians. You\u2019ve seen the film, whether that\u2019s the charming 1961 animated version with one of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-YkJdYQzis\">catchiest tunes ever</a> (\u201cCruella de Vil, Cruella de Vil, if she doesn\u2019t scare you, no evil thing will\u201d), or the 1996 live-action version starring the goddess that is Glenn Close.</p> <p>But while the films should be an integral part of any childhood, they don\u2019t really measure up to Dodie Smith\u2019s book. For one thing, that\u2019s not even the real title. The novel is called The Hundred and One Dalmatians, and, as you might expect from the author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/may/31/featuresreviews.guardianreview25\">I Capture the Castle</a>, it\u2019s far richer and funnier than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/dec/12/artsfeatures1\">the films</a>. When I went back to it recently \u2013 favourites from my childhood seem to be what I need to read right now \u2013 I was entirely entranced by it, once again.</p> <p>In Smith\u2019s story, the dogs are vastly superior to the humans, though they\u2019re very fond of them and consider them as pets who are \u201cgentle, obedient, and unusually intelligent \u2013 almost canine, at times\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cLike many other much-loved humans, they believed they owned their dogs, instead of realising that their dogs owned them,\u201d writes Smith, a dog lover herself, who owned nine Dalmatians. \u201cPongo and Missis found this touching and amusing and let their pets think it was true.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3cf1202446c625044c6d31b4acc236c40d709b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3cf1202446c625044c6d31b4acc236c40d709b4/14_13_2432_1669/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spots all over \u2026 some of the pups featured in a 1996 version of Smith\u2019s The Hundred and One Dalmatians.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"686\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spots all over \u2026 some of the pups featured in a 1996 version of Smith\u2019s The Hundred and One Dalmatians.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And the novel also includes a third adult Dalmatian. When Pongo and his wife Missis have 15 puppies, Mrs Dearly (no Roger and Anita here) goes out to find a dog who can help feed them and bumps into Perdita by the roadside. (But don\u2019t worry, this doesn\u2019t spark some canine menage a trois, Pongo is clear that while Perdita is a \u201cvery pretty girl\u201d, she\u2019s \u201cnot a patch on his Missis\u201d.)</p> <p>Fortunately for the Dearlys, they find themselves \u201crather unusually rich\u201d, because Mr Dearly has \u201cdone the Government a great service (something to do with getting rid of the National Debt) and, as a result, had been let off his Income Tax for life\u201d. This is the sort of line I\u2019d have had no idea about as a child, but which amuses me enormously as an adult.</p> <p>But unfortunately, while out for a walk in Regent\u2019s Park with Nanny Cook (plump) and Nanny Butler (plumper), they run into a certain Cruella de Vil. She was at school with Mrs Dearly, until she was expelled for the hilarious crime of drinking ink, and when she spots the Dalmatians she notes that they would make \u201cenchanting fur coats\u201d. The Dearlys are invited for dinner \u2013 purple soup, green fish, pale blue meat and black ice cream, all of which tastes of pepper \u2013 and the adventure begins.</p> <p>You know what happens next. The puppies are kidnapped, Pongo and his wife (who is Missis, not Perdita, remember!) set out to find them. They rescue them, all 97, The End. But there is so much more to Smith\u2019s novel along the way: Cruella\u2019s \u201cabsolutely simple white mink coat\u201d; Pongo and Missis trying to tell the Dearlys where the puppies are with a \u201cwuff, wuff, wuffolk\u201d; Colonel Sheepdog promoting himself to Brigadier General, and making his cat assistant Pussy Willow a Captain after the puppies are saved.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"406d57f60e9b191560f71cadf7d0e4746d891937\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/406d57f60e9b191560f71cadf7d0e4746d891937/0_187_2828_1698/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dodie Smith in 1934.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dodie Smith, who owned nine Dalmatians, pictured in 1934.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sasha/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is genuine terror here as well. When the puppies are trapped in Hell Hall, they fling a bone over the wall scratched with SOS: Save Our Skins. And there\u2019s something nightmarish about Hell Hall itself. When the rescuers arrive, Missis gasps, \u201cIt\u2019s seen us!\u201d because \u201cit really did seem as if the eyes of the house were staring at them from its cracked and peeling black face\u201d.</p> <p>The wisdom of the book feels particularly poignant during these strange times: as the Dearlys sit sadly on Christmas Eve, waiting in vain for their dogs to come home, Mr Dearly puts some carols on the gramophone. \u201cNow carols are always beautiful but if you are sad they can make you feel sadder. (There are some people who always find beauty makes them feel sadder, which is a very mysterious thing.)\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s no more comforting scene in all literature than when Pongo and Missis \u2013 bedraggled, injured and exhausted \u2013 are taken in by an ancient spaniel, whose pet is the equally ancient Sir Charles. The spaniel feeds them his supper, lets them sleep in Sir Charles\u2019s four-poster bed, and then brings them to the Great Hall, where Sir Charles toasts endless slices of bread on the fire, buttering them thickly before tossing them to the spaniel who hands them on to his friends.</p> <p>So if you\u2019re feeling sad, anxious and exhausted \u2013 and aren\u2019t we all these days? \u2013 there\u2019s no better antidote than returning to The Hundred and One Dalmatians. All I need now is one hundred and one slices of hot buttered toast.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump has rebuked a state governor and Republican ally over his decision to reopen bowling alleys, hair salons and other businesses on Friday \u201cin violation\u201d of the phased federal guidelines.</p> \n<p>\u201cI want him to do what he thinks is right, but I disagree with him on what he\u2019s doing,\u201d the US president said of Brian Kemp, the governor of Georgia. \u201cI think spas and beauty salons and tattoo parlours and barbershops in phase one ... is just too soon.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump was speaking on Wednesday at a wide-ranging coronavirus taskforce briefing in which he announced he had signed a \u201cvery powerful\u201d order curbing immigration, contradicted experts on how long the virus will linger and compared the crowd size at his last 4 July celebration to Martin Luther King\u2019s I Have a Dream speech.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/22/georgia-reopening-kemp-governor-mayors\">Georgia's Covid-19 reopening pits white governor against black mayors</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Georgia\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/21/georgia-mayors-brian-kemp-republican-coronavirus\">huge gamble</a> is likely to be watched closely by state governors across the nation. Trump released national guidelines last week for states to pursue a staggered reopening of their economies once they achieve 14 days of declining new infections \u2013 a criterion that the Peach State has not met.</p> \n<p>Kemp endured widespread ridicule when he admitted, on April Fools\u2019 Day, that he had only just learned that people without symptoms can still spread coronavirus, even though health experts had warned about the possibility for months.</p> \n<p>Georgia now has more more than 21,000 infections and 846 deaths, according to the state department of public health. The state has tested less than 1% of its population for Covid-19, ranking in the bottom 10 per capita and raising fears that it could suffer a resurgence and be forced into another lockdown.</p> \n<p>On Friday, elective medical procedures will resume and barbershops, nail salons and gyms will reopen with restrictions and requirements to stagger shifts and keep workspaces six feet apart. Limited in-restaurant dining will resume next week but bars and nightclubs will remain closed.</p> \n<p>Trump said he had spoken to Kemp, for whom he campaigned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/03/georgia-governor-stacey-abrams-brian-kemp\">against the Democrat Stacey Abrams in 2018</a>, and made his views clear. \u201cThey can wait a little bit longer, just a little bit, not much, because safety has to predominate. We have to have that. So I told the governor very simply that I disagree with his decision but he has to do what he thinks is right.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, joined the criticism. \u201cIf I were advising the governor, I would tell him that he should be careful,\u201d Fauci said at the briefing. \u201cI would advise him not to just turn the switch on and go, because there is a danger of a rebound.\u201d</p> \n<p>Democrats seized on the president\u2019s remarks. Nikema Williams, the chairwoman for Democratic party of Georgia, said: \u201cYou know it\u2019s a serious failure when Donald Trump, whose failed leadership is responsible for how badly this crisis is hitting America, distances himself from his crony Brian Kemp, who is endlessly determined to make this crisis as painful as possible for Georgians.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump and his experts appeared less in sync, however, on the potential risk of a coronavirus resurgence in the autumn, or fall. First the president falsely claimed that Dr Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, had been \u201ctotally misquoted\u201d in a Washington Post article <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/coronavirus-second-wave-hydroxychloroquine-trial\">about the danger</a> of the virus in tandem with seasonal flu.</p> \n<p>He then had to look on as Redfield told reporters: \u201cI\u2019m accurately quoted in the Washington Post.\u201d </p> \n<p>Trump shifted gear and objected to the newspaper\u2019s headline, before seeking once again to downplay the threat: \u201cWe will not go through what we went through for the last two months \u2026 And if it comes back, though, it won\u2019t be coming back in the form that it was. It will be coming back in smaller doses that we can contain \u2026 It may not come back at all.\u201d</p> \n<p>Fauci, however, was bluntly realistic: \u201cWe will have coronavirus in the fall. I am convinced of that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump also announced that he had signed an executive order that will temporarily suspend the issuance of certain green cards for 60 days he said aimed at protecting American jobs. The order includes a long list of exemptions, including for those who are currently in the country, those who have valid immigrant visas, people seeking entry to work as physicians and nurses, and the spouses and unmarried children of US citizens.</p> \n<p>But the American Civil Liberties Union warned that the order will delay the ability of families to reunite and of employers to hire workers necessary to their enterprises. Omar Jadwat, director of its immigrants\u2019 rights project, said: \u201cWhile the order is limited in scope, President Trump\u2019s transparent attempt to distract from his own failures with this unwarranted suspension will cause real pain for families and employers across the country.</p> \n<p>\u201cMeanwhile, he continues to fail to take obvious steps that will save lives \u2013 like releasing people from Ice facilities that cannot keep them safe from Covid-19. We all deserve better leadership than this.\u201d</p> \n<p>In a bizarre riff, Trump also spoke optimistically about staging a 4 July celebration on the National Mall, including an air display. He compared the turnout at last year\u2019s event to the March on Washington in 1963. \u201cI saw a magnificent picture of Dr Martin Luther King and I saw a magnificent picture of our event last year, and both of them were maxed out. It was beautiful to see. Beautiful, very similar. This year, most likely, we\u2019ll be standing six feet apart. We\u2019ll have to do that in a very interesting way.\u201d</p> \n<p>Histories of the Trump presidency are likely to record how he compared the crowd size at his inauguration, also on the National Mall, to that of Barack Obama, even though photos show his predecessor\u2019s was significantly bigger.</p>",

Further downstream, however, Egypt has long seen the Gerd as an existential threat that could deprive its 100 million people of the water they need to survive in a changing climate. Some Egyptian officials have even <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/hacked-stratfor-emails-egypt-could-take-military-action-to-protect-its-stake-in-the-nile-2012-10\">discussed</a> bombing the dam.</p> <p>Ethiopia and Sudan say the dam\u2019s hydropower is essential for their citizens to develop and thrive.</p> <p>Mufti fingers prayer beads as he talks: \u201cI believe that within one year of the filling of the dam\u2019s reservoir, shortcomings will start to appear,\u201d he says. \u201cThis dam is endangering rights \u2013 the right to life and the right to work.\u201d</p> <p>He also fears the dam itself risks collapse. \u201cThere will be a shortage of water, and a lack of safety of the dam abrogating [the] human right to life of the Sudanese people.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1c599bb20f2bc558d6e65efc1fcbe1344a8ad1f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c599bb20f2bc558d6e65efc1fcbe1344a8ad1f9/0_0_4000_2661/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Families gather by the shallow waters of the Nile River at Tuti island in Khartoum, where the Blue Nile and the White Nile meet to become the Nile river\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Families gather by the Nile river at Tuti island in Khartoum, where the Blue Nile and the White Nile meet to become the Nile river.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ozan K\u00f6se/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mufti left Sudan\u2019s delegation to the talks in 2010 after Ethiopia declared it would continue building.

Last year at this time, the water was plentiful.\u201d</p> <p>The Blue Nile offers a terrifying picture of the climate crisis \u2013 not just for Sudan\u2019s water resources but for the entire region. Ali walks over cracked soil as he points at the remaining crops with his cane, his long white robe billowing in the winds.<br><br>As Sudan, Egypt and Ethiopia argue over the Nile Basin\u2019s waters, the climate crisis is encroaching. Ali wants the river to sustain his crops, which this year featured much more alfalfa because it can be grown in dry areas. But this meant fewer profits; alfalfa does not generate as much profit as the tomatoes and okra he sells in Khartoum. The lack of water also meant money was needed for a diesel-powered pump for irrigation.<br><br>He knows the exposed riverbed means that communities downstream will experience drought. The water levels were so low, he was convinced that the Ethiopian authorities had begun filling the dam\u2019s reservoir, decreasing the flow to the Blue Nile. \u201cI think the dam is affecting us here,\u201d he says, repeating the fears of other local farmers.</p> <p>The lack of water is already displacing people. \u201cI know farmers who have given up their land and have moved to work with others who can afford pumps,\u201d says Ali, who fears the same fate if he can\u2019t keep up with the increasing costs. \u201cWe have never been tired like this year. With this amount of water, how can I farm? We don\u2019t go to the government for the solution,\u201d he says bitterly.<br><br>Further up the bank, cotton farmer Hassan Khallafallah was proud of this year\u2019s crop, but worried about next year.

The Sudanese proposal optimises the power generation from the Gerd \u2013 Ethiopia\u2019s objective \u2013 and minimises harm during filling and operation to both downstream countries of Sudan and Egypt,\u201d he said in a statement to the Guardian.<br><br>Hamid stressed that the countries had \u201cagreed on a filling timetable of seven stages. This can increase or decrease from seven years\u201d, according to drought and water levels, lengthening the timetable if the water levels of the Blue Nile are lower than average.<br><br>A shared filling timetable is needed because the dam will <a href=\"https://e360.yale.edu/features/vanishing-nile-a-great-river-faces-a-multitude-of-threats-egypt-dam\">create a reservoir</a> twice the size of the Hoover Dam\u2019s Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the US, decreasing the flow of the Blue Nile by up to 25% and potentially decreasing the power of Egypt\u2019s Aswan dam.</p> <p>While the preliminary agreement mentions potential dry periods, there has been extraordinarily little mention of climate change, an undeniable threat to water resources.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"566afa166e9f9479ce716c78d63d55bdee49339e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/566afa166e9f9479ce716c78d63d55bdee49339e/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters against the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance dam in Khartoum, Sudan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters against the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance dam in Khartoum, Sudan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sudanese supporters of the dam say the annual rainy season that helps the Nile flood provides more than enough water.

The drill sergeant is a traditional figure here, and Hilton Pelser\u2019s performance as the monstrous Sergeant Brand measures up in sadism and abuse.

The story of a young white man seeing military action in the service of the apartheid regime, finding comradeship with other white men and never for one moment questioning what he is doing might look now like a tragic or pathetic story of naivety. (One of them, Sachs, played by Matthew Vey, offers some limited leftist talk of Mao and Che in a bar.) But, in this context, it is the gay white man, not the black man, who has victim status.

Look at the moon with your naked eyes and notice the dark and light-grey patches. Light-grey areas are mountainous highlands; the dark grey are long-dried-up lava beds called \u201cseas\u201d because early astronomers took them for actual seas. If you look closely you can see a white circle (where the seven would be if the moon were a clock face) with rays of white pointing out from it. This is Tycho; a crater about as big as East Anglia. If you have any kind of binoculars \u2013 old or even toy ones \u2013 grab them and have a closer look at the moon. You\u2019ll see more detail around the craters and seas but have a look around the edge of the moon, too, and see it\u2019s not a perfect circle. The rough, jagged outline is because of lunar mountain ranges.</p> <p>The phase of the moon changes daily. The phase is how much of the moon is visible from Earth \u2013 full, half and crescent, for example. The line between the light and dark side of the moon is called the terminator. Each night, look closely at the terminator and you\u2019ll see different craters, valleys and mountain ranges as the line slowly moves across the surface.</p> <h2>Planets</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fccfc37a4a775f35702f88db1edb9c8fe89d8918\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fccfc37a4a775f35702f88db1edb9c8fe89d8918/0_0_4782_3188/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Night sky, with constellations and Venus and Mars close to each other.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Night sky, with constellations and Venus and Mars close to each other.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brickley Pix/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the evening, Venus is a bright dot in the west. It shines brightly because the thick clouds that shroud it are reflecting sunlight towards us. If you\u2019ve got binoculars to hand, or a small telescope, notice that Venus isn\u2019t a perfect circle either \u2013 it has phases just like the moon.</p> <p>In the east on pre-dawn mornings throughout April and May, Jupiter, Saturn and Mars line up as three incredibly bright colourful dots. They\u2019re all visible with the naked eye, though with binoculars Mars will look salmon pink, Saturn oval-shaped (because of the rings) and you may even see some of Jupiter\u2019s moons.</p> <p>On 4 July after 9.30pm, the Moon, Jupiter and Saturn will all be very close together in the sky, forming a conjunction, which is a rare event.</p> <h2>Constellations and stars</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ad994832235d125e5c8d7a18211046e4ff10c12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ad994832235d125e5c8d7a18211046e4ff10c12/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stars of the Plough constellation in the night sky.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stars of the Plough constellation in the night sky.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Howard Litherland/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Constellations are official patterns of stars, and you\u2019ll be familiar with some names and patterns. During April, Orion will be visible in the west after sunset. Recognisable by the three stars in a row that form his belt, this is one of my favourites because hanging from his belt is a \u201csword\u201d containing another three stars and the middle \u201cstar\u201d is a naked-eye visible nebula where baby stars are being born. Look at this with binoculars and you may spot a blurry smudge that some see as coloured turquoise.</p> <p>Look north for the Plough (often called the Big Dipper). The second star on the \u201chandle\u201d of the Plough is a naked-eye double star. Look closely or use binoculars and you\u2019ll be able to see them clearly even with high light pollution.</p> <h2>International Space Station</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4116db9a1fddf8c201c27e57c7f320eedf69bab8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4116db9a1fddf8c201c27e57c7f320eedf69bab8/0_111_1440_789/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Screengrab from spotthestation.nasa.gov\" width=\"1000\" height=\"548\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Screengrab from <a href=\"https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/\">spotthestation.nasa.gov</a></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Orbiting the Earth, 250 miles up, is the International Space Station (ISS), home to (usually) six astronauts from around the world.

A year ago the prime minister, Mark Rutte, gave a<a href=\"https://www.government.nl/documents/speeches/2019/02/13/churchill-lecture-by-prime-minister-mark-rutte-europa-institut-at-the-university-of-zurich\"> sweeping vision of a savvier, more realpolitik-</a><a href=\"https://www.government.nl/documents/speeches/2019/02/13/churchill-lecture-by-prime-minister-mark-rutte-europa-institut-at-the-university-of-zurich\">positioned EU in the world</a>. Surveying \u201cthe chaos of Brexit\u201d, Rutte said, \u201cthere is no such thing as splendid isolation\u201d. Dutch Eurosceptic parties have quietly shelved visions of \u201cNexit\u201d.</p> <p>And yet Dutch political scientist Catherine De Vries sees echoes of the British debate. The Dutch political class, which she notes like to describe their country as \u201cthe Netherlands Inc\u201d have a transactional attitude to Europe. The Dutch have benefited tremendously from \u201cthe tree of European integration\u201d, she observes. \u201cNow that we have been able to reap the fruits of those developments, we are questioning whether we need the tree anymore or do we actually need to water the tree?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/after-coronavirus-how-will-europe-rebuild\">After coronavirus: how will Europe rebuild?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf Dutch politicians don\u2019t explain for a very long time how the Dutch economy benefits from the single market, it\u2019s very difficult to explain why the Dutch should pay for the single market \u2026 That reminds me very much of the British discussions.\u201d</p> <p>The Dutch are hardly alone in keeping a flinty eye on EU spending. With Austria, Denmark and Sweden, the Dutch make up \u201cthe frugal four\u201d that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/21/eu-leaders-at-odds-over-filling-brexit-shortfall\"> helped sink a deal on the next EU budget</a> in February. But no other leader seems to cause as much irritation as Rutte, who arrived at the summit with a biography of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin to get through that night, because \u201cwhat else is there to do\u201d. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, was said to have been irked by Rutte\u2019s \u201cchildish\u201d behaviour, the Dutch daily Volkskrant reported.</p> <p>Rem Korteweg, a senior research fellow at the Clingendael Institute in The Hague, blames \u201cshambolic PR\u201d by the powerful Dutch finance ministry and \u201cpoor diplomacy\u201d for the current Dutch EU woes. Exhibit A is the Dutch finance minister, Wopke Hoekstra, who voiced contrition after remarks questioning why some countries lacked financial buffers to cope with the coronavirus shock provoked a furious reaction.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"426b49f4a63698749b6f60ca776ff955f07cd3d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/426b49f4a63698749b6f60ca776ff955f07cd3d7/275_406_3835_2301/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, is said to have irked EU leaders by arriving at a summit with a book to read.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bart Maat/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Korteweg thinks the Dutch also failed to see which way the Germans were leaning in a recent debate on crisis rescue plans, leaving them <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/08/eurozone-fails-to-agree-on-540bn-coronavirus-rescue-plan\">isolated at a </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/08/eurozone-fails-to-agree-on-540bn-coronavirus-rescue-plan\">Eurozone finance ministers\u2019 meeting</a>. \u201cOn economic and financial issues the Netherlands always likes to be Robin to Germany\u2019s Batman,\u201d he said. But it also suits Germany to have the Dutch \u201cplay the bad guy\u201d, he added. \u201cGermany having the Dutch on their outer right-hand flank allows Germany to play a more central and more mediating role.\u201d</p> <p>Dutch author <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/joris-luyendijk\">Joris Luyendijk</a> points to political games ahead of next year\u2019s elections. \u201cOne reason the Dutch are so loud is that Hoekstra is positioning himself to succeed Rutte as the Dutch prime minister and for that he needs to look tough. This is very British: playing domestic politics in Brussels.\u201d</p> <p>However, there are deeper reasons for the cooling romance between Dutch political elites and Brussels. The Dutch, one of the largest small member states, have lost weight since enlargement to eastern Europe. Disaffection was evident in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jun/02/eu.politics\">resounding </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jun/02/eu.politics\">Dutch no to the EU constitution in 2005</a>, which De Vries sees as opening the way to the more \u201ctransactional discourse\u201d about the EU in domestic politics. \u201cThat was then exploited by the extreme right,\u201d she says, who fanned claims about \u201c\u2018an EU superstate and wasteful bureaucracy\u2019.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/apr/11/eu-coronavirus-relief-deal-enemies-debt-eurozone\">The EU's economic response to coronavirus helps only Europe's enemies | Yanis Varoufakis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now the Netherlands is coming under pressure from France, Spain and Italy to pledge \u201csolidarity\u201d, code for more spending, either via shared debt, or massive grants to help the worst-hit countries. In <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9667bd73-a809-497e-a3ca-8781c0549901\">an interview with the Financial Times</a>, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, effectively pinned responsibility for the EU\u2019s fate on Germany and the Netherlands agreeing \u201cfinancial transfers and solidarity\u201d. Anything less would fuel populism in Italy, Spain and perhaps France, the French president argued.</p> <p>It is an argument that cuts little ice in the Dutch parliament, where Rutte\u2019s government has no majority in either chamber. Earlier this month seven lawmakers tabled a resolution against \u201cdebt union\u201d, led by Pieter Omtzigt, an influential voice in the Christian Democratic Appeal party that is part of Rutte\u2019s coalition. Asked if any Dutch government would agree mutualised debt, Omtizgt responded simply: \u201cNo.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"607e424497adc4342b403996af475a77783509d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/607e424497adc4342b403996af475a77783509d9/0_203_4675_2804/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The French president, Emmanuel Macron\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The French president, Emmanuel Macron, pictured meeting farmers in Brittany on 22 April, has pinned responsibility for the EU\u2019s fate on Germany and the Netherlands agreeing financial solidarity.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: St\u00e9phane Mah\u00e9/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dutch government sources, in common with German ones, think others fail to appreciate big offers already made in the white heat of the crisis, from tearing up EU stability and growth pact rules, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/ecb-asset-purchase-programme-boosts-euro\">the European Central Bank\u2019s \u20ac750bn bond-buying programme</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/eu-risks-break-up-over-coronabonds-row-warns-italian-pm\">a \u20ac540bn rescue package.</a></p> <p>As other incumbent leaders across the world, Rutte is enjoying a surge in the polls, while his rivals in the far-right Freedom party and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/03/thierry-baudet-dutch-rightwing-populism\">populist Forum for Democracy </a>have been sinking. But politics is volatile. \u201cA move towards eurobonds in March of next year would be a windfall for Forum for Democracy,\u201d suggests Korteweg. \u201cThey would want nothing less than that Rutte is forced to sign up to a form of eurobonds and then cash in at the ballot box in March.\u201d</p> <p>Luyendijk adds: \u201cMacron is half-right because, yes, refusing mutualised debt will fuel populism in the south. But by adopting mutualised debt you are going to fuel populism in the north. Dutch train drivers work till 65 while their French colleagues can retire in their late or even early 50s. Where is the solidarity in that?\u201d But never say never, he says. \u201cBluntness bordering on boorishness is quintessentially Dutch but so is, in this country of coalitions, flexibility and flip-flopping.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>In the summer of \u201999, before I started high school, I spent the New Year holidaying with my best friend William\u2019s family at Coopers Beach, in the far north of New Zealand. The beach was idyllic, with warm water and pohutukawa trees that overhung its golden sands. But we didn\u2019t go swimming. Instead, we relentlessly watched a VHS copy of Adam Sandler-starring golf comedy Happy Gilmore.</p> <p>Based on an average 10-day holiday, my projection is 40 viewings of the film. Some might dispute this figure, but some disputed whether Happy Gilmore deserved to play in the Tour Championship and, spoiler, he won.</p> <p>Forty viewings of any motion picture can have deep and lasting repercussions on your psyche. I know the film\u2019s weird minutiae precisely, like the curve of the tongue on the mini-golf park clown Happy trashes during a training scene.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/22/orphan-black-gripping-sci-fi-series-shows-that-in-dark-times-family-or-a-clone-club-prevails\">Orphan Black: gripping sci-fi series shows that in dark times, family (or a 'clone club') prevails</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To me, the film\u2019s villain Shooter McGavin trying to dislodge a deflated beach ball from his nine-iron is the equivalent of the plastic bag in American Beauty.</p> <p>Shooter McGavin is the embodiment of evil, driven by ego and a relentless desire for a gold jacket. He has no redeeming qualities and looked a little bit like my dad who has plenty but dresses just as badly. Apparently Kevin Costner turned down the role because he\u2019d already signed on for Tin Cup and didn\u2019t want to do two golf movies in one year. Two golf movies might have saved Costner from sinking his career with Waterworld, in the same way that Happy Gilmore saved me from Waterworld New Zealand, AKA the ocean.</p> <p>Adam Sandler\u2019s bravura performance as the deranged ice hockey-player-turned-golfer revealed itself as a nuanced masterpiece to the 12- and 13-year-old brains of William and myself.

Steve (who legally changed his name to Estevez at some point) was obsessed with Michael Jackson. His room was stuffed with MJ memorabilia and he even sported a white-hatted, Smooth Criminal-era, Michael Jackson tattoo on his shoulder.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know what possessed Steve to change his name to Estevez, but I do know that watching Happy get his arse handed to him over and over again in his fist fight with US game show host Bob Barker (who was apparently trained in real life by Chuck Norris) reinforced in me that fighting is dumb and embarrassing. I also have a deep reverence for mentor figures (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vFPAyJXN1k\">RIP Chubbs</a>) \u2013 and Julie Bowen\u2019s Virginia Venit (the head of Tour Championship PR and Happy\u2019s love interest) remains a shining model of professionalism in the face of workplace condescension.</p> <p>But if there\u2019s one lesson to take from Happy Gilmore in this time of lockdown it comes in the film\u2019s most recognisable scene, in which Sandler\u2019s bent over on all fours screaming at his golf ball: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just go home! That\u2019s your home! Are you too good for your home?!\u201d</p> <p>Now is not the time to be the recalcitrant golf ball. Go to your home and stay in it. You\u2019re not too good for it. Treasure your home like Happy treasures his grandma\u2019s house.

My heart hurts more than my head over his infection. This virus does not discriminate. While kids are more resilient, they can suffer same severity of symptoms. I\u2019m applying a modified version of my remedies for his protocol with a focus on lots of vitamins. Since his sense of smell and taste have disappeared, I am feeding him healthy foods that I normally can\u2019t get him to touch. I kept a diary of the past week including my remedies and things that I did to stay sane through it all. \ud83d\ude4f Link in bio, as they say.</a></p> <p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;>A post shared by <a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/cristinacuomo/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;> Cristina Cuomo</a> (@cristinacuomo) on <time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2020-04-22T17:41:41+00:00&quot;>Apr 22, 2020 at 10:41am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=&quot;//www.instagram.com/embed.js&quot;></script></body></html>\"></iframe> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea0d82b8f0898fe360d660a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T23:50:19.249Z\">12.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>That briefing has now ended.
