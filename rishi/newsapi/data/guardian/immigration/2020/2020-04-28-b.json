  "<p>When New Zealand holds its post-virus general election later this year, the country will go through a fiercely ideological debate about economics and resources.</p> <p>On 19 September, New Zealanders are scheduled to go to the polls. By then, the country is likely to have eliminated Covid-19, providing an enormous boost for Jacinda Ardern\u2019s government, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/new-zealand-starts-gradual-exit-from-coronavirus-lockdown\">which is blitzing the immediate health crisis.</a></p> <p>However, at the election New Zealanders will also be evaluating the contrasting left-and rightwing prescriptions for dealing with a severe economic depression. And that could see a fiercely-ideological election debate based around economics and resources.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/why-do-female-leaders-seem-to-be-more-successful-at-managing-the-coronavirus-crisis\">Are female leaders more successful at managing the coronavirus crisis?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Currently, the treasury is forecasting unemployment could go as high as 26%. Regardless of whether this worst-case scenario comes to pass, there will be extreme economic dislocation and suffering. Politicians will need to provide voters with a compelling vision, backed by detailed policies, for rebuilding the country.</p> <p>Recreating the old order won\u2019t be good enough. After all, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/ardern-accused-of-making-new-zealand-businesses-sacrificial-lambs-in-covid-19-lockdown\">the looming depression </a>will come on top of huge pre-existing problems of inequality, poverty, a housing affordability crisis, and a creaking welfare state.</p> <p>If Labour is to embody the spirit of the times, it will embrace radical new economic policies. This means proposing new progressive income taxes, a wealth tax, a universal basic income, a massive state housing programme, and an overhaul of the public health system. And that\u2019s just for starters.</p> <p>If National is to keep to its conservative impulses, then it will campaign on being \u201cbetter economic managers\u201d, cutting regulations, reducing taxes on business, and generally letting the private sector lead the recovery.</p> <p>However, it\u2019s unlikely that a traditional austerity sales pitch will be welcome in 2020. The landscape has changed dramatically, with traditional rightwing economic prescriptions now jettisoned by governments of all colours. Instead of a small state being the answer, the crisis has required huge state intervention. As a number of economists have noted, we\u2019re all socialists now.</p> <p>The state has even bailed out of the most rightwing voice in New Zealand politics \u2013 the Taxpayers Union. For this neoliberal lobby group to apply for, and be given, $60,000 of subsidies in order to keep operating is testament to the fact that the old order of pro-market politics has died.</p> <p>National will have to do better than recycle policies from the neoliberal era. In fact, to be truly competitive it is very likely, come September, they will be proposing their own big-spending statist economic interventions. On issues such as infrastructure, National has the potential to be an even bigger party of government than Labour.</p> <p>Policies such as a universal basic income \u2013 once relegated to the political fringes \u2013 could even be adopted by the right.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/apr/23/covid-19-crisis-reset-economies-sustainable-footing\">The Covid-19 crisis creates a chance to reset economies on a sustainable footing | James Shaw</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For the immediate future, politics is going to be all about economics. In that sense it will mark the return of the traditional left-right politics that dominated the 20th century, before social issues gained the ascendancy. Since the 1960s, politics in countries like New Zealand have become less about economics (or what political scientists call \u201cmaterialist concerns\u201d) and more about post-materialist issues.</p> <p>These non-economic issues \u2013 debates on everything from nuclear weapons, abortion, sexual politics, racism and environmentalism \u2013 never fitted easily into the traditional left-right spectrum.</p> <p>Important debates raised by feminists, M\u0101ori nationalists, the peace movement, environmentalists and so forth also brought into play concepts such as culture wars, political correctness, identity politics, woke politics, and social liberalism. Alongside this, other non-materialist concerns around free speech, immigration, and religion have been central to understanding modern politics.</p> <p>The importance of these strains of contemporary politics wax and wane, and at various times the culture wars have receded. When the global financial crisis hit in 2008, there was a concentration on more basic economic issues. On the left there was a spike of concern about workers\u2019 rights, economic inequality, the welfare state, and so forth.</p> <p>Such concerns underpinned much of the debate in New Zealand\u2019s 2008, 2011 and 2014 elections. Then, with economic prosperity returning, post-materialist concerns came to the fore again. Issues like gender and ethnic inequality dominated, especially on the left. And climate change grew to become an overarching concern.</p> <p>In the wake of Covid-19, post-materialist issues are likely to weaken once again, becoming overshadowed by more basic concerns about putting food on the table.</p> <p>Labour and National, as the original left-right political parties, will be relatively well suited to this re-emerging debate on economic and resource issues.</p> <p>But where will the minor parties fit in? Even before the coronavirus crisis, the minor parties were struggling for relevance. This situation has only been made worse, and some could even be finished off by the return to a more economic focus.</p> <p>The Greens are unlikely to prosper, and may not even survive, as concerns about the environment take a back seat for voters dealing with an economic crisis.</p> <p>The rightwing Act party, which has at times played a central role in the culture wars, especially on free speech issues, will have to reorientate towards its original radical pro-business programme.</p> <p>The M\u0101ori party, currently out of Parliament, will have to prioritise being the voice of M\u0101ori at the bottom of the economic pile.</p> <p>There is still one rising non-economic concern that provides an opportunity for a minor party: nationalism. According to a number of opinion polls we\u2019re experiencing a surge of patriotism. People are celebrating New Zealand\u2019s stand-out success in battling the virus. There\u2019s one party that is uniquely equipped to surf that wave \u2013 Winston Peters\u2019 New Zealand First.</p> <p>Given National has ruled out building a government with Peters\u2019 help, any surge of nationalist support for NZ First will make the re-election of the Labour-led Government much more likely, regardless of what happens in the economic debates.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Bryce Edwards is a senior associate at the Institute for Governance and Policy Studies at Victoria University, Wellington, New Zealand</em></p></li> </ul>",

Headlined \u201c<a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30134-0/fulltext?dgcid=raven_jbs_etoc_email\">Decolonising Covid-19</a>\u201d, it argues that even before the health impact of the pandemic has been felt in the developing world, it\u2019s economic impact is proving hugely damaging. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>UNDP has estimated income losses of US$220 billion in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) and that nearly half of all jobs in Africa could be lost. This, combined with the potential health impact, could be catastrophic. A Comment published in The Lancet Global Health in April found that a rapid acceleration in the number of cases in west Africa, as has been seen in Europe, could quickly overwhelm vulnerable health systems that typically have fewer than five hospital beds per 10,000 population. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>There is a risk, the Lancet says, that attempts to tackle the pandemic by richer nations could leave the developing world \u201cin the dark\u201d, whilst, at the same time, expertise developed in Africa from dealing with, for example, the Ebola epidemics, is not being respected. </p> \n  <p>And, it adds, \u201ca sinister undercurrent has re-emerged\u201d as teams around the world race to develop treatments and vaccines for Covid-19.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>At the beginning of April, two French doctors sparked an intense backlash over comments made during a live television discussion about Covid-19 trials in Europe and Australia by saying that the studies should be done in Africa first \u201cwhere there are no masks, no treatments, no resuscitation\u201d, reasoning that certain studies on AIDS had been carried out in prostitutes \u201cbecause we know that they are highly exposed and that they do not protect themselves\u201d. </p> \n   <p>Africa is a continent where the legacy of colonialism is particularly heavy. It is shocking to hear these remarks from scientists in the 21st century, at a time when the work of epidemiologists, infectious disease modellers, public health specialists and, indeed, all health workers, is in the public spotlight like never before. At the WHO press briefing on April 6, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus responded plainly, \u201cTo be honest, I was so appalled, and it was at a time when I said we needed solidarity. These kinds of racist remarks will not help. It goes against solidarity. Africa cannot and will not be a testing ground for any vaccine \u2026 The hangover from a colonial mentality has to stop.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2214-109X%2820%2930134-0\">Read the rest of the article here</a>.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-28T14:44:46.071Z\">at 3.44pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea83bf48f082c9ba20aa187\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-28T14:23:22.004Z\">3.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is <strong>Damien Gayle</strong> taking back control on the live blog now, with thanks to Simon Burnton for covering my break.

This will now be eased and new measures introduced. These include a nationwide night-time curfew, mandatory wearing of facemasks and a ban on \u201cnon-essential\u201d travel between different regions.</p> \n  <p>But a new and immediate two-week lockdown will be imposed in northern Nigeria\u2019s largest city Kano after officials said they were probing reports of \u201cmysterious deaths\u201d that doctors say often involve pneumonia.</p> \n  <p>In <strong>South Africa</strong>, where a strict nationwide lockdown has confined 56 million people to their homes for all but essential journeys since late March, restrictions are being loosened on Friday to allow some people to go back to work in designated industries and basic public transport to function. Schools however remain shut and sales of alcohol banned.</p> \n  <p>South Africa has been lauded for its aggressive effort to root out pockets of infection with screening and testing, as well as its big economic relief package. However there are signs that the lockdown - which has been largely respected - is beginning to fray. </p> \n  <p>In a national address last week, Cyril Ramaphosa described five stages of progressively looser lockdown. But no dates have been given for moving down (or up) the scale beyond May 1st and the shift to phase four, and different phases can be imposed in different parts of the country simultaneously. </p> \n  <p>Strategies have differed across Africa. <strong>Kenya </strong>has imposed a loose lockdown in the capital Nairobi and port city of Mombasa along with a nationwide curfew. <strong>Ghana </strong>recently lifted most of the restrictions placed on inhabitants of major cities but has maintained a ban on social events and public gatherings are still banned. </p> \n  <p>So too has the <strong>Democratic Republic of Congo</strong>, which imposed a loose lockdown on parts of the capital Kinshasa. In <strong>Malawi</strong>, legal action has blocked attempts by the government to impose a lockdown while in <strong>Tanzania</strong>, president John Magufuli has been criticised for not imposing one fast enough. <br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-28T13:57:26.830Z\">at 2.57pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea8312c8f08103bdf809770\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/kim-willsher\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-28T13:41:09.496Z\">2.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Philippe also said there was a risk of France\u2019s economy collapsing if the lockdown was not ended, and that the country\u2019s hospitals had held up well to the challenge posed by the virus.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe risk of a second wave, which might mean another lockdown, is a risk we have to take seriously,\u201d he said, adding France had to \u201cprotect, test and isolate\u201d. </p> \n  <p>The lockdown would be followed by a monitoring phase, which would continue until 2 June, with regulations differing between regions. \u201cOur national strategy has to be adapted to different circumstances,\u201d Philippe said, adding that he would be meeting local officials on Wednesday and unions on Thursday to discuss the end of lockdown measures.</p> \n  <p>\u201cSo, we have to live with virus, to end the lockdown progressively and adapt to circumstances; these are the three elements of our strategy,\u201d he said.<br></p> \n  <p>Philippe said the availability of masks had been a subject that angered and upset a lot of French people. \u201cGiving masks to medical workers, necessarily meant depriving others of them,\u201d he said. </p> \n  <p>He said local authorities that bought masks would be reimbursed by the government for half the price, and that there would be enough masks in the country for the general public by 11 May, the day the lockdown ends, but said it would be some time for masks to be freely and widely available in shops.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-28T13:43:53.198Z\">at 2.43pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea8301f8f082c9ba20aa0f2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/kim-willsher\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-28T13:33:25.592Z\">2.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">French prime minister outlines schedule for end of lockdown</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The French prime minister, <strong tabindex=\"-1\">\u00c9douard Philippe,</strong><strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong>has begun outlining the schedule for the end of the coronavirus lockdown in France to MPs in the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale. </p> \n  <p>Philippe began saying the situation was unique. \u201cWho could have envisaged a France where schools, universities, caf\u00e9s, restaurants, the majority of businesses, libraries \u2026 beaches, stadia \u2026 would be closed.

the lowest per capita in the world. </p> \n  <p>The antibody tests taken from blood samples do not always pick up early-stage infections but show whether a person had the virus in the past, even if the person had no symptoms. </p> \n  <p>In comparison, the standard swab test determines whether a person has the virus at that moment by looking for it in secretions. <br></p> \n  <p> Several Indian

unification minister Kim Yeon-chul, who oversees North Korea engagement, told lawmakers. </p> \n  <p>He said at a parliamentary hearing </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is true that

particularly unusual given the current (coronavirus) situation.\u201d </p> \n  <p>The US president, Donald Trump, said on Monday he has a good idea how Kim Jong-un is doing and hopes he is fine, but would not elaborate. </p> \n  <p>The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said he was aware of reports on Kim\u2019s health and he was was paying close attention to developments. </p> \n  <p>North Korea had cancelled some large events, and imposed a border lockdown and quarantine measures in an effort to prevent an outbreak of the coronavirus. </p> \n  <p>But if Kim Jong-un is hiding out due to fears surrounding Covid-19, it would \u201cpuncture a hole in the state media narrative of how this crisis has been perfectly managed\u201d, said Chad O\u2019Carroll, CEO of Korea Risk Group, which

has rejected claims it was the origin of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n  <p>The head of the lab told Reuters the claims have no basis in fact, adding there were still no conclusive answers as to where the disease started. </p> \n  <p> Conspiracy theorists have claimed Covid-19, now responsible for more than 200,000 deaths worldwide, was synthesised by the <strong>Wuhan Institute of Virology</strong> (WIV), based in the city where the disease was first identified. </p> \n  <p>Though the scientific consensus is that the coronavirus evolved naturally, such claims have gained traction. </p> \n  <p>The US president, Donald Trump, said on 15 April that his government was investigating whether it had originated in the Wuhan lab. </p> \n  <p>Yuan Zhiming, professor at WIV and the director of its National Biosafety Laboratory, said \u201cmalicious\u201d claims about the lab had been \u201cpulled out of thin air\u201d and contradicted all available evidence. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThe WIV does not have the intention and the ability to design and construct a new coronavirus,\u201d he said in written responses to questions from Reuters. \u201cMoreover, there is no information within the SARS-CoV-2 genome indicating it was manmade.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Some conspiracy theories were fuelled by a widely read scientific paper from the Indian Institute of Technology, since withdrawn, claiming that proteins in the coronavirus shared an \u201cuncanny similarity\u201d with those of HIV. </p> \n  <p>However, most scientists now say Covid-19 originated in wildlife, with bats and pangolins identified as possible host species. </p> \n  <p>\u201cMore than 70% of emerging infectious diseases originated from animals, especially wild animals,\u201d Yuan said. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIn recent years, we have seen increasing risks posed by close contact between humans and wild animals, with global climate change and the continuous expansion of human activities,\u201d he said. </p> \n  <p>All seven known human coronaviruses have origins in bats, mice or domestic animals, scientists say. </p> \n  <p>Yuan also rejected theories that the lab had accidentally released a coronavirus it had harvested from bats for research purposes, saying the lab\u2019s biosecurity procedures were strictly enforced. </p> \n  <p>\u201cHigh-level biosafety labs have sophisticated protective facilities and strict measures to ensure the safety of laboratory staff and protect the environment from contamination,\u201d he said. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div

Government has ended in-person visits in the country\u2019s correctional facilities, <a href=\"https://www.icrc.org/en/document/covid-19-detainees-solomon-islands-can-now-call-their-loved-ones\">replacing them with scheduled phone calls</a> using phones donated by the International Committee of the Red Cross. Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare announced Friday that the nation <a href=\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/415197/solomons-has-capability-to-test-for-covid-19-in-country\">now has domestic testing capability</a>, thanks to equipment donated by China.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Vanuatu:</strong> The country\u2019s third largest island is in <a href=\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/415230/vanuatu-s-malekula-in-lockdown-after-interaction-with-filipino-boat\">temporary lockdown</a>. Travel to Malekula and its surrounding islands is forbidden following the news that two men had ignored quarantine rules and gone aboard a Philippines-based cargo ship. Officials say there is only a very low likelihood that anyone on board is infected, but they\u2019re taking no chances.</p></li> <li><p><strong>New Caledonia:</strong> The resumption of domestic flights has been deferred until 4 May and international flights remain barred, except for repatriation. Pro-independence members of the government have <a href=\"https://www.lnc.nc/breve/les-membres-independantistes-du-gouvernement-s-opposent-a-l-arrivee-dimanche-de-militaires-de-metropole\">asked that a flight carrying 180 military personnel be cancelled</a>. This flight is part of the regular rotation of French soldiers stationed overseas. </p></li> <li><p><strong>Samoa:</strong> The IMF last week approved a <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2020/04/24/pr20189-samoa-imf-executive-board-approves-us-million-disbursement-address-covid-19-pandemic\">US$22m concessional loan</a> to the government Samoa to address \u201curgent balance of payment needs created by Covid-19.\u201d Samoa has long been saddled with high levels of debt, including loans from China EXIM Bank.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Marshall Islands:</strong> The foreign minister has joined the governor of Guam in expressing concern about the travel of US citizens to Guam and the Marshalls while the Covid-19 crisis persists.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Federated States of Micronesia:</strong> The United States government last week announced a multi-million dollar assistance package for Pacific island countries, including about US$7.7m for the FSM.</p></li> <li><p><strong>French Polynesia: </strong>Health minister Jacques Reynal claimed this week that the <a href=\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/415175/french-polynesia-considers-covid-19-stopped\">transmission of Covid-19 in the territory has \u201cstopped</a>\u201d. This comes four days after two new cases were reported. A territory-wide curfew is scheduled to end today.</p></li> <li><p><strong>French Polynesia:</strong> The territory <a href=\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/415292/another-covid-19-case-in-french-polynesia-as-restrictions-eased\">reported another case on Tuesday</a>, bringing the total to 58. This came just days after health minister Jacques Reynal claimed the transmission of Covid-19 in the territory had \u201cstopped\u201d. A territory-wide curfew is scheduled to end today.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Palau:</strong> The government has taken delivery of four tonnes of medical aid donated by a Cambodia-based company Horizons Holdings. The cargo arrived by chartered aircraft from China.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Guam:</strong> Citing the possibility of undetected cases among neighbouring populations, Governor Lou Leon Guerrero has written to US Vice President Mike Pence <a href=\"https://www.civilbeat.org/2020/04/guam-asks-to-pause-migration-from-3-pacific-nations-during-virus-crisis/\">to request a suspension</a> of incoming international flights from Palau, the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia. None of these nations have any confirmed cases. </p></li> </ul> <h2>Australia and New Zealand</h2> <p>Australia has just over 6,600 cases and 84 deaths from Covid-19. The rate of infection has continued to slow, with the country recording between nine and 21 new cases a day for the past seven days. Many states have announced slight loosening of lockdown laws, and more than two million people across the country have downloaded an app that aims to assist the government with contract tracing of cases.</p> <p>New Zealand\u2019s strict level-four lockdown ended on Monday night, meaning that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/fried-chicken-and-bento-new-zealanders-dream-of-takeaways-as-lockdown-prepares-to-lift\">New Zealanders are now allowed to go out for takeaway</a> and some are able to return to work. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/new-zealand-prepares-to-lift-strict-lockdown-after-eliminating-coronavirus\">Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the country</a> had successfully stopped the \u201cwidespread, undetected community transmission\u201d of Covid-19.

  "<p>An Iranian scientist who has been pleading for weeks to be released from a US immigration jail due to his fragile health has contracted Covid-19, according to his family and attorneys.</p> <p>Dr Sirous Asgari, a materials science and engineering professor who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/sirous-asgari-coronavirus-us-ice-immigration-detention\">spoke out in March</a> about the unsanitary and \u201cinhumane\u201d conditions in detention, was placed in an isolation cell this week inside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) jail in Louisiana. His lawyers learned on Tuesday that his Covid-19 test was positive, and in a phone call with the Guardian, Asgari had a bad cough and said he had had a fever for days.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/sirous-asgari-coronavirus-us-ice-immigration-detention\">'I won't survive': Iranian scientist in US detention says Ice will let Covid-19 kill many</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He and his family are calling for his release to a medical facility where he can receive proper care.</p> <p>\u201cIt makes sense to send me to the hospital as soon as possible. I don\u2019t trust them at all,\u201d the 59-year-old said on Tuesday amid repeated coughing fits. \u201cIf something happens, they are not fast responders \u2026 I prefer to leave this dirty place.\u201d</p> <p>Asgari\u2019s story sparked international outrage after he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/sirous-asgari-coronavirus-us-ice-immigration-detention\">spoke</a> about his fears of Covid-19 spreading inside crowded Ice facilities with substandard cleaning practices and a lack of supplies. The professor, who has a history of respiratory problems, was exonerated in a US sanctions trial last year, but Ice has refused to release him or allow him to return to Iran. Iran\u2019s foreign minister recently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JZarif/status/1243504082050068481\">called</a> for his release, as have some <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoaquinCastrotx/status/1246909194781052928\">US lawmakers</a> and human rights groups.</p> <p>Asgari is confined to a small room at the Winn correctional center in a Louisiana, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/12/coronavirus-us-deep-south-poverty-race-perfect-storm\">state hard hit by coronavirus</a>.</p> <p>Ice informed the attorneys that Asgari\u2019s test was positive on Tuesday, but Asgari said Ice had not yet told him the results and that he had learned of them on a call with his family and lawyers. \u201cThe nurse \u2026 always says the test results are not in,\u201d Asgari said, noting that the medical staff checked on him twice or three times a day.</p> <p>Ice told Asgari\u2019s lawyers he would only be released to a hospital if he was struggling to breathe, the attorneys said.</p> <p>Bryan Cox, an Ice spokesman, said there were two confirmed Covid-19 cases at Winn but declined to answer specific questions about Asgari.</p> <p>The professor has repeatedly raised concerns about Ice continuing to bring in new detainees into the close quarters of the facility, mixing them with those already jailed. Asgari said he got a bad fever after Ice recently brought a new group to his pod.</p> <p>The specifics of Asgari\u2019s case have been particularly shocking to immigration attorneys. Asgari, a father of three, has deep ties to the US, including two children living in America. In 2017, he was charged with fraud and trade secret theft relating to his work with a university in Ohio. But after a long trial, he was acquitted in November 2019.</p> <p>But because the US had revoked his original visa, he was taken into Ice custody and has remained detained. Since the pandemic hit, he has tried to \u201cself-deport\u201d to Iran or get approval to stay with his family in the US but has been denied. Now, even if released, he would probably be unable to get on an immediate flight due to his diagnosis.</p> <p>\u201cThis mass [detention] under this outbreak of a nasty virus is absolutely wrong,\u201d Asgari said on Tuesday after learning of his test results. \u201cWhat more proof do they need?\u201d </p> <p>Asgari said he was unable to shower while in isolation and was given a bowl of water he could use to wash his head. He said he had also pleaded for fresh fruit, which he has not had for a month.</p> <p>At Winn, he and other detainees <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/us-jail-immigrants-coronavirus-deportation\">told the Guardian</a> last month that many of them were trying to get deported because they were so fearful of Covid-19 exposure inside. Several men said the detainees were responsible for all cleaning, and there was a single shower and only two toilets for all 44 of them to share. They are also sleeping on beds spaced roughly 2ft apart.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this is happening. It\u2019s devastating,\u201d said Mehrnoush Yazdanyar, an attorney working with Asgari\u2019s family. \u201cEvery fear he had has been realized, one by one, with him ending up with Covid-19. This is an innocent man who hasn\u2019t committed any crimes. He shouldn\u2019t be behind bars. Why does the US government continue to keep him in detention?\u201d</p> <p>The number of positive Covid-19 cases inside Ice jails has been steadily climbing, with Ice officials reporting that <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article242203726.html\">hundreds of detainees</a> have the virus. But only a fraction of people inside immigration jails have received tests so far, and rights groups fear the rate could be much higher. Some judges have ordered Ice to release detainees due to Covid-19 risks, and advocates have urged the US to conduct immediate mass releases to avoid a huge death toll inside.</p> <p>As of 18 April, Ice had 30,737 people in custody, and the population in jails has declined by roughly 8,000 since 29 February, according to the Ice spokesman.</p> <p>Cox said Ice had adequate cleaning supplies, adding in an email that the agency had \u201ca long history of handling communicable diseases in the course of everyday operations\u201d and had \u201ctaken extensive precautions to limit the potential spread of COVID-19\u201d.</p>",

This marks a sharp rise from the official death toll up to 10 April, which was 1,043. From Wednesday, the government will publish daily figures for the number of coronavirus deaths in care homes and the community. This follows complaints for many weeks that by only publishing hospital deaths, figures could be underestimating the true number of deaths by as much as half, according to some estimates.<br></li> \n   <li>The Scottish government published new guidance recommending <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/28/sturgeon-urges-scots-to-wear-coronavirus-face-masks-for-shopping-and-travel\">the public should wear face coverings</a> in \u201climited circumstances\u201d where it was not always possible to remain two metres apart, for instance in supermarkets and on public transport. The UK government said it was still considering advice submitted on this issue submitted by Sage last week, which maintained there is \u201cweak\u201d evidence of face masks having a \u201csmall\u201d protective effect.

Announcing the cuts, IAG said it expected recovery to 2019 passenger levels to take several years.</li> \n   <li>Eligibility for free coronavirus tests has been extended to NHS patients and staff who do not have symptoms, and care home residents and staff who do not have symptoms (those who do have symptoms qualify for tests already). Anyone over 65 with symptoms and anybody who needs to leave home to go to work who has symptoms, as well as members of their family, will also be eligible. </li> \n   <li>And the former prime minister Theresa May urged ministers to consider the impact of lockdown for domestic abuse and mental health, as well as the economy, when deciding how quickly to lift restrictions. Speaking in a debate on the domestic abuse bill, she said there was \u201cclear\u201d evidence that domestic abuse was increasing during lockdown because perpetrators have greater freedom to act and victims find it harder to leave. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s it from us today on the UK side, thanks to all of you for following along and to everybody who got in touch with tips and suggestions.

Here\u2019s an extract.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>After the Plague and the Great Fire, London was rebuilt by [the architect Christopher] Wren. In the decades after the second world war, London\u2019s manufacturing base dwindled to a fraction of its former self, and the Docks, the hub of the world\u2019s goods-trading economy were shuttered. But London was reborn as a city of services \u2013 financial, business, educational, creative, cultural, scientific, technological and more.</p> \n   <p>It seems unlikely that London, and cities like it, are about to disappear. But London may become a very different place from what it is now. A city where creative class or knowledge workers work from home as much as they commute to the office. Where the jostling for the best table in the restaurant takes place when booking online and not in the queue on the street. Where stadiums, art galleries and concert halls are redesigned to ensure public health along with entertainment and high culture. Where delivery vehicles are necessarily electric, and deliveries are grouped by algorithms and priced accordingly. Where pavements and public areas are widened to allow easy transition to social distancing, and where road space is recognised as a precious asset and charged for as such. Where the slow process of reimagining the high street gets speeded up. In this new London, centrality will retain both its allure and its economic benefits \u2013 but they will become relatively more expensive.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In Scotland pavement widening is already on the agenda.

Cycling campaigners welcomed the initiative, asking councils to quickly install new infrastructure.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SpokesLothian/status/1255143756791025666\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SpaceForDistancing?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SpaceForDistancing</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SpacesForPeople?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SpacesForPeople</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CovidStreets?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CovidStreets</a><br><br>Statement by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MathesonMichael?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MathesonMichael</a> MSP<br><br>\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\udeb2is up 35%<br>\ud83d\ude42he wants this to continue, also to grow\ud83d\udeb6\u200d\u2640\ufe0f<br>\ud83d\ude42100% cash to councils (\u00a310m fund) for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PopUpBikeLane?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#PopUpBikeLane</a>/<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/widefootway?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#widefootway</a><br>\ud83d\ude42legal certainty &amp; help to councils<br><br>\ud83d\ude4b\u200d\u2640\ufe0fNow Councils must step up! <a href=\"https://t.co/tY3XnoPM3a\">pic.twitter.com/tY3XnoPM3a</a></p>\u2014 Spokes CycleCampaign (@SpokesLothian) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpokesLothian/status/1255143756791025666?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 28, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-28T15:31:17.001Z\">at 4.31pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea841be8f082c9ba20aa1e8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-28T14:46:42.024Z\">3.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cce5a40afc546a82d474ed39fda9480860dc360d\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cce5a40afc546a82d474ed39fda9480860dc360d/0_184_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Signs thanking key workers and the NHS are seen in south London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Signs thanking key workers and the NHS are seen in south London.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron Chown/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea840578f08103bdf80982f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/deniscampbell\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-28T14:41:57.140Z\">3.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Matt Hancock</strong> was wrong to state earlier that some children have died from the new set of serious symptoms that resemble toxic shock syndrome and is closely linked to Covid-19, it has emerged.</p> \n  <p>When asked about the condition on LBC radio this morning the health secretary said: \u201cWe have lost some children.\u201d However, he was referring to children dying from Covid-19 and not from this new inflammatory syndrome, which is confounding and worrying doctors. </p> \n  <p>The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has now clarified that Hancock did not mean to suggest that any children had lost their lives as a result of the new set of symptoms, which include intense stomach pain, gastrointestinal problems and an inflamed heart. </p> \n  <p>A source at the DHSC said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The health secretary was referencing deaths we\u2019re aware of that sadly related to Covid-19 not the inflammatory syndrome.

The high court last year ruled the scheme \u2013 which obliges private landlords to check the immigration status of tenants and prospective tenants, with the risk of five years in prison if they get it wrong \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/01/right-to-rent-scheme-ruled-incompatible-with-human-rights-law\">to be racially discriminatory</a>.</p> <p>Whatever its intention, what the law did in practice was encourage many landlords to withhold places to live from anyone who carried the potential for trouble under the act. The high court had ruled the measure unfair, saying it had \u201clittle to no effect\u201d on controlling immigration and that it flew in the face of human rights laws guaranteeing freedom from discrimination. That seemed sensible.</p> <p>Enter the appeal court, considering a cry of foul from a government that talks of the hostile environment as if it were a relic of the past while simultaneously keeping its strictures in place. The appeal court accepted that, under this law, some landlords did indeed discriminate against would-be tenants who had no British passport \u2013 as is the case with 17% of British nationals in England and Wales. That in itself was a victory for those such as the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI) who opposed the scheme. But the appeal court judges dismissed the view of the high court and ruled the scheme, for all its problems, \u201cjustified\u201d and \u201cproportionate\u201d. They used legalese language but, basically, their conclusion was: \u201cHey, bad stuff happens.\u201d</p> <p>No law is perfect. But how can it be right to legally bolster a scheme so palpably open to abuse against such a significant section of lawfully entitled residents and British citizens? Are they, despite human rights law that is supposed to protect them, to be seen as collateral damage by ministers stuck in the mindset that caused the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\">Windrush scandal</a>? Indeed the very people affected by that scandal, those unable to fully document their legitimate status, are the ones who could be made to suffer all over again when landlords deny them a place to live.</p> <p>The judges took the literal view that the legislation as written does not instruct landlords to discriminate. \u201cDiscrimination is not sanctioned under this scheme,\u201d they said. They were comforted by Home Office assurances that the checks landlords must take \u2013 sight of variables such as passports, ID cards, driving licences and letters from government departments \u2013 were not excessively onerous, and that landlords were told of the \u201cneed to treat all tenants equally\u201d. Meanwhile, they were told, empathetic officials helped vulnerable people meet the requirements. And to all that, the judges nodded agreement.</p> <p>But would any reasonable person, knowing the Home Office\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/27/home-office-windrush-report-damns-hostile-environment-policy\">hostile environment record</a>, accept these as realistic safeguards against discrimination? </p> <p>In fact the judgment noted evidence provided by the Residential Landords Association indicating that under this law, 5-6% of landlords discriminated against potential tenants who did not have British passports \u2013 and that the \u201cevidence of likely intent produces a figure of over 40%\u201d. But hey, bad stuff happens.</p> <p>Migrants legitimately seeking homes may suffer discrimination, judges said. But the discrimination is \u201centirely coincidental\u201d. The government and its legislation can\u2019t be blamed if people don\u2019t obey. Yet that is, of course, to dismiss the impact of discrimination on those who bear the brunt of it. And, as we know, people will often abuse bad law.</p> <p>And so ministers have their victory. As things stand, a bit of discrimination is acceptable. \u201cI am delighted,\u201d crowed the junior immigration minister Chris Philp.</p> <p>Thankfully, our system still has safeguards. The JCWI says it will refer the matter to the supreme court. So there is still a chance to draw a line in the sand, and to declare there is no level of acceptable discrimination. </p> <p>Yes, bad stuff happens. But it\u2019s no basis for public policy.</p> <ul> <li><p>Hugh Muir is a senior assistant G1 editor</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Frida Kahlo made a dramatic entrance to her only solo show in Mexico City. The artist arrived by ambulance and had to be stretchered into the gallery. Her sick bed, which had preceded her by truck, awaited her. The tequila flowed.</p> <p>The 46-year-old artist, who had less than a year to live, spent many months confined to bed by injury and illness during her short life. But her bedroom in La Casa Azul, the family home in Mexico City that she transformed into a sanctuary and menagerie, was where she blossomed as an artist.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e0aa579bb9e8811ed2b91ceb040b5f2d90729eb0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0aa579bb9e8811ed2b91ceb040b5f2d90729eb0/0_0_2398_3600/666.jpg\" alt=\"Self-Portrait Dedicated to Dr Leo Eloesser, Frida Kahlo, 1940.\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Self-Portrait Dedicated to Dr Leo Eloesser, Frida Kahlo, 1940.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 2020 Banco de M\u00e9xico Diego Rivera Frida Kahlo Museums Trust, Mexico, D.F. / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cShe made art out of her pain and her frustration,\u201d says the author <a href=\"https://www.jessieburton.co.uk/index.html\">Jessie Burton</a>, who painted her own writer\u2019s hut blue as a homage to the Mexican artist\u2019s home in Coyoac\u00e1n. \u201cBeing contained not just in her house but in a bed for so long meant her art was almost like a metaphysical resistance. She was going to break out of those four walls, express herself and tell her story through painting.\u201d</p> <p>Kahlo\u2019s life story, a triumph of creativity against the odds, makes her a role model for an artist in quarantine. Most of her paintings are modest in size but pack a powerful punch. While Diego Rivera, her older and more famous husband was painting murals in Detroit in the 1930s, she was painting an early masterwork, the nude-self portrait Henry Ford Hospital, to channel the grief and trauma of losing a child, coupled with the death of her mother. It is the first depiction of a miscarriage in western art history.</p> <p>Back in Mexico, her bedroom was a safe haven but it was also a stage. Burton says that there is always an element of performance in her art and the way she fashioned her image. \u201cAll of these paintings are gestures of keeping up one\u2019s spirit, accepting one\u2019s lots and doing the best with it but there were a lot of complicated things going on.\u201d</p> <p>Kahlo might seem the modern artist most suited to self-isolation but she would have hated not being able to socialise and flirt. One of several lovers, the artist<a href=\"https://www.noguchi.org/isamu-noguchi/biography/biography/\"> Isamu Noguchi</a>, had to flee the Casa Azul when almost caught in bed with Kahlo by a gun-toting Rivera. Noguchi recalled: \u201cEverything that she couldn\u2019t do, she loved to do. It made her absolutely furious to be unable to do things.\u201d That included dancing, despite her disabilities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b986bd01f39dc7090322681f87f03036ad095f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b986bd01f39dc7090322681f87f03036ad095f4/0_273_2720_1910/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Detail from Henry Ford Hospital by Frida Kahlo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"702\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Detail from Henry Ford Hospital by Frida Kahlo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gianni Dagli Orti/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe worse she felt, the more she would adorn herself,\u201d says Circe Henestrosa, who co-curated the V&amp;A\u2019s Frida Kahlo show in 2018. The artist survived polio as a child but it left her with a withered and shortened right leg. She wore long skirts and three pairs of socks to disguise her disability from a young age. Kahlo\u2019s pelvis was smashed in a bus crash, aged 18. Henestrosa explains that Kahlo used her distinctive style, a blend of traditional Mexican Tehuana dresses, and modern European fashion, to draw focus from the torso up, and so distract attention from her wounded body.</p> <p>In the year she spent bed-bound afterthe crash, Kahlo abandoned her plan to become a doctor and turned to art. The artist\u2019s familiarity with death, which she nicknamed \u201cla pelona,\u201d the bald one, meant she never pulled her punches on canvas. She had no hesitation about portraying blood, her own and other\u2019s. The American playwright and politician <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Clare-Boothe-Luce-American-playwright-and-statesman\">Clare Boothe Luce</a> was shocked to receive a portrait she commissioned from Kahlo of a mutual friend. The Suicide of Dorothy Hale depicts the death of the aspiring actor, who jumped off a skyscraper. It is one of Kahlo\u2019s most surrealist works, a label she rejected. \u201cI never painted my dreams,\u201d she said. \u201cI painted my reality.\u201d</p> <p>Kahlo\u2019s art also continues to resonate today because of her radical politics. An idiosyncratic mix of communism, Mexican pride and lapsed Catholicism, she was a far more outspoken critic of America than her husband. Henestrosa points to a late, unfinished self-portrait of 1954 in which Stalin looms over Kahlo. It is not the kind of image reproduced in Kahlo kitsch and merchandise. Her Marxism recently irked Donald Trump\u2019s US ambassador Christopher Landau, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/frida-kahlo-mexico-christopher-landau-ambassador-twitter-us-trump-a9090126.html\">who tweeted </a>on a visit to Casa Azul that he admired the artist but had problems with her admiration of Stalin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f628faf478d16f19b9c700027bba4b1bc6758b59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f628faf478d16f19b9c700027bba4b1bc6758b59/0_0_2527_2999/843.jpg\" alt=\"The Suicide of Dorothy Hale, by Frida Kahlo.\" width=\"843\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Suicide of Dorothy Hale, by Frida Kahlo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Craig Smith/Collection of Phoenix Art Museum, gift of an anonymous donor</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Henestrosa had just finished installing an exhibition of the artist\u2019s extraordinary wardrobe in San Francisco\u2019s de Young Museum when coronavirus hit. The clothes and paintings now hang in darkened galleries. The museum\u2019s director, Thomas Campbell, who hopes to extend the loans so the show can reopen, says that Kahlo\u2019s words - \u201cFeet, what do I need you for when I have wings to fly?\u201d - have become an inspirational mantra during the lockdown.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hettie-judah\">Hettie Judah</a> has written a new book about Kahlo, which is due to be published later this year. She describes how, when ill and near death, Kahlo recalled in her diary an earlier period of confinement. As a child, struck down with polio, she would breathe against the window of her bedroom and draw a door through which she escaped in her imagination.</p> <p>Like the elderly Matisse, painting and collaging in the south of France, Kahlo transformed her mundane surroundings into something magical.

The Spanish newspapers had just <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/coronavirus-spanish-flu-1918-pandemic-from-spain\">faithfully reported its devastating effects</a>. Unlike Spain, a neutral power in the first world war, countries like the UK and the US were saddled with legislation banning reporting that lowered morale. This led to what is often classed as a catastrophic failure of the fourth estate. Vital health reporting was relegated to dismissive paragraphs, so mass gatherings went ahead and the bitterest harvest was reaped. Meanwhile, papers such as the Washington Times went big on things like a picture of a soldier chasing a turkey wearing a fez, beneath the headline THANKSGIVING IS COMING!

  "<p><br>Three days before the UK went into lockdown and the world changed beyond all recognition, I had to catch a train from London to Edinburgh with my six-year-old autistic son, two-year-old daughter and partner. We were travelling back to Scotland a week later than planned after a harrowing visit with my parents. My mother, who has metastatic breast cancer, had ended up in intensive care just as the first UK deaths from coronavirus were being announced. She was still in hospital when we left. Now, somehow, I needed to make the magical transformation from daughter to mother, get my head in gear and get my children home before the journey I had been routinely making for 20 years became, at worst, impossible or, at best, freighted with risk.</p> <p>Two days earlier, my partner had tried to take him home to give me a little more time with my mum, but at King\u2019s Cross he had a meltdown and refused to get on the train. It is perhaps one of the great understatements of my life to say that my nerves were jangling.</p> <p>The usual questions replayed on a loop composed by anxiety. Would he get in the taxi or run away? (He would get in the taxi.) Would he be able to cope with the sensory overload of the platforms at King\u2019s Cross? (Yes.) Would there be time to grab a coffee and sandwich? (Of course not.) Now, suddenly, there was a new strain of questions. Would the train be too busy for us to keep our distance from other passengers? Would there be handwash in the toilets, and would we be able to get our son to use it? And when we got home, would we be able to get the handful of foods he eats or would the Birds Eye Chicken Dippers have been emptied from Tesco?</p> <p>We families of autistic children are a resilient bunch. We have learned the high art of appearing calm as we work our arses off to make this noisy, intolerant and unpredictable world habitable for our children. We are like the people who paint the rooms before the Queen enters them, forever one step ahead of our little rulers, trying to make their passage through life smoother, better, happier. We are fighters. And it turns out these skills are extremely handy in a global pandemic.</p> <p>Self-isolation is, for many families, an overdramatic descriptor of daily life. Physical distancing often comes with the territory. My son used to have a habit of screaming, \u201cSAY GOODBYE!\u201d to any friend I ran in to on the street until I had no choice but to carry out his orders. Don\u2019t get me wrong. He loves people, but he needs to know when they\u2019re coming.</p> <p>His passions before the pandemic were school, a special-needs family swimming session every Saturday, watching the trains from a nearby McDonald\u2019s car park with a McFlurry and chips, the play park, the local ice-cream shop and going to visit \u201cAjji and Tata\u201d (my parents) in London. None of this is possible now. And like many autistic people, my son struggles with change and chronology. So according to neurotypical reasoning, life under lockdown would be especially hard for him. This is why it\u2019s a relief that the UK coronavirus rules have been relaxed for people with autism and learning disabilities, which means families like ours can leave our homes for exercise more than once a day and travel beyond our local area if necessary. And sometimes, for us, it is. My son might be pro-physical distancing as a rule of thumb, but he doesn\u2019t know how to keep two metres apart from anyone. He has a deep sensory love of running his body and hands along railings and walls. The world is now a minefield.</p> <p>Yet he is coping brilliantly. New routines have been laid down, quickly and organically. Every day he scoots three circuits of our local park with his \u201cbabuga\u201d (our son\u2019s name for his other mother: its etymological root is \u201cbike\u201d\u2026 don\u2019t ask). He doesn\u2019t notice people wearing masks, perhaps because he struggles with facial recognition, perhaps because this simply isn\u2019t the way his brain identifies humans. In the morning, we act out The Tiger Who Came to Tea in his bedroom (his sister is daddy, I\u2019m the tiger, my son, naturally, is EVERYONE). In the afternoon he jumps up and down on our coal box, and we shout at him ineffectually. He says hello to Ajji and Tata on the phone: my mother is back at home thanks to the everyday miracle of NHS social care we are only now beginning to acknowledge. There is screen time, the building of train tracks and ceaseless reciting of the alphabet.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>His autistic logic results in a Zen-like acceptance of our new reality that no mindfulness course could teach</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I wouldn\u2019t call any of it home-schooling exactly, unless doing a roly-poly on to a cherry tomato is on the curriculum, but his progress continues at its own idiosyncratic and spellbinding pace. And witnessing the flowering of my son\u2019s relationship with his sister has been one of the happiest experiences of my life. As well as being deeply challenging, lockdown is a tender lesson in what really matters not just to my son but to all small children. Home. The family unit. A cup of popcorn on the sofa in front of Paddington 2. The little things. We never did big birthday parties or trips to the museum so this collective simplifying of our days is already familiar to us. What\u2019s amazing is not how much is lost, but how much is gained when restrictions are imposed upon us.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll go back to school on \u2026 Monday? Tuesday?\u201d This is what my son says every day, though it\u2019s unclear if he is genuinely asking or just likes the repetition of the days of the week. The point is he\u2019s fine with it. School is closed. It would be impossible for him to go until it\u2019s open again. And that\u2019s that. His autistic logic results in a Zen-like acceptance of our new reality that no mindfulness course could teach. Meanwhile, my neurotypical two-year-old is asking why people are wearing masks. Fear of the world beyond our front gate is creeping in. The other day, she breathed a sigh of relief when we turned on to an empty street and said softly from her buggy: \u201cIt\u2019s nice and quiet here.\u201d</p> <p>One of the paradoxes of lockdown in a city is the horizons that have broadened overnight. Our street now has the requisite WhatsApp group filled with everyday gallantry and pledges to hold a street party once this is all over. I told this group my son is autistic and favours a particular brand of margherita pizza if anyone spotted one. A neighbour, whom I probably still wouldn\u2019t recognise if I saw her, promptly delivered two large pizzas to our doorstep and refused payment, saying her nephew was autistic and had a similarly restricted diet. The following week another pizza appeared from \u201cNo 18\u201d. I don\u2019t think any of them knew our son was autistic before this crisis. They probably saw him careering down our street barefoot or loudly reciting the numbers on their front door in his phase when he had to \u201cdo my numbers\u201d before coming home. Perhaps they drew their own conclusions. Now they know they are responding not just with kindness but pizzas. And disclosures of their own.</p> <p>Meanwhile, my son continues to meet the precariousness of life with courage, humour and idiosyncrasy. In my admittedly limited and neurotypical experience, lockdown is both harder and easier for him than I might have expected. Not that I have many expectations. Another skill acquired from parenting my son \u2013 and no one on this ravaged planet has taught me more than this particular six-year-old boy \u2013 is to expect nothing beyond having every single one of your assumptions challenged. There may be no going back to how things were, but there is no going forward either. According to my son\u2019s watertight logic, now is the only place to be.</p>",
  "<p>The vulture culture of endless TV reboots relies on the lure of familiarity, enticing viewers with the promise of something they remember fondly from the past. A big part of that nostalgia can be a memorable theme tune, which presents producers with a sonic dilemma: bring back the beloved track wholesale as a respectful hat-tip to history? Risk giving it a modern spin that may alienate hardcore fans? Or is it time to abandon the creaky old version and try something new?</p> <p>ITV\u2019s recently rebooted Van Der Valk with Marc Warren went the remix route, which makes it the first of these valuable case studies.</p> <h2>Van Der Valk</h2> <p>If you set aside Barry Foster\u2019s wondrous golden curls, the one thing everyone remembers about Van Der Valk is the theme tune. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/sDvZquq5TxE\">Eye Level</a> was an appealing nursery-rhyme melody with an oompah strut, lavishly rendered by the Simon Park Orchestra. Originally written by Jack Trombey (a pen name for the Dutch composer and trombonist Jan Stoeckart), it started life as a piece of library music, but in 1973 was abruptly elevated to the status of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/zvesdlGe-EI\">platinum-certified No 1 smash</a> thanks to Van Der Valk\u2019s success. Wisely, it was revived intact for the 1990s continuation. But the 2020 version \u2013 with episode one now available on <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/hub/itv\">ITV Hub</a> \u2013 takes a much more tentative approach, favouring a soundscape of moody strings while piping in the merest whisper of Trombey\u2019s melody, as if a child is picking out Eye Level on piano in the next room. If this new incarnation is killed off after one season, the wishy-washy theme will be the prime suspect.</p> <h2>Dynasty</h2> <p>If you go back and watch any of the glitzy turbo-soaps of the 1980s \u2013 such as <a href=\"https://youtu.be/H2J4YJ2mXyU\">Dallas</a>, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/cF2Opqt-iKU\">Dynasty</a> or the winetastic <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ypZT4lQHoK8\">Falcon Crest</a> \u2013 it feels as if their title sequences are as luxurious as the affluent families portrayed, stretching to a minute or even longer. How best to honour these lush, full orchestra mini-suites in the time-poor 2010s? A Dallas revival in 2012 attempted <a href=\"https://youtu.be/VhCJJ7EbUNU\">a subtly nipped and tucked version of the classic theme</a>, but was cancelled after three seasons. The current Dynasty reboot takes a more aggressive approach, filleting the memorable middle eight from Bill Conti\u2019s rousing original and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/5pUFTS2b6j8\">remixing it into a savagely brief but club-ready banger</a>. It\u2019s an inspired workaround.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f70938ffd399f1b03862e3a304bf1b32dcf3342\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f70938ffd399f1b03862e3a304bf1b32dcf3342/0_367_1549_929/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper in the revamped Doctor Who.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper in the revamped Doctor Who.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Doctor Who</h2> <p>When Russell T Davies rematerialised Doctor Who in 2005, it was 16 years after the last Sylvester McCoy-led season and almost a decade since Paul McGann\u2019s ill-fated TV movie. Rebooting is built into the sci-fi show\u2019s DNA, but there was probably some nervousness among fans that the relaunch might ditch <a href=\"https://youtu.be/75V4ClJZME4\">the classic Who theme</a>, composed by Ron Grainer and brought to otherworldly life by Delia Derbyshire and her BBC Radiophonic Workshop synth sorcery. In the end, the new composer Murray Gold stayed <a href=\"https://youtu.be/z75qvDtbxjQ\">pretty faithful to the original</a>, ramping up the percussion and adding a restless violin counter-melody. Like the Doctor themselves, it\u2019s a timeless theme that keeps coming back in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/NiI4yoOHNx0\">subtly altered forms</a>.</p> <h2>Battlestar Galactica</h2> <p>With its magisterial brass fanfares, stately pace and strident melody, the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/shyJyAk2-l0\">original theme for Battlestar Galactica</a> \u2013 credited to composer Stu Phillips and show creator Glen A Larson \u2013 would have been the perfect overture for an epic, galaxy-spanning space opera. Unfortunately, the short-lived 1978 series about a devastating star war between ruthless robots and space-refugee humans was laden with hammy acting and a confusing mythology. Ronald D Moore and David Eick revived the brand in 2003 for an apocalyptic miniseries and by the time it morphed into a TV drama, it had <a href=\"https://youtu.be/mKJLt7AZnr0\">a thrilling new theme by Bear McCreary</a>. Characterised by keening singing and Stomp-style drum freak-outs, it was a useful signpost that this gritty reboot would be a million light years from the garish old BSG.</p> <h2>Blockbusters</h2> <p>First broadcast in 1983, the hexagon-heavy student favourite has proved to be a surprisingly durable format, with a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/kKhnVvHWJ3A\">whooshing, futuristic theme to match</a>. After an initial decade-long run with suave Bob Holness at the helm and an audience hand-jive on Fridays, it has been variously revived by the BBC, Challenge TV and Sky (twice). Perhaps the short-lived BBC Two version hosted by Michael Aspel in 1997 would have lingered in more people\u2019s minds if it hadn\u2019t swapped out the original banging theme tune for <a href=\"https://youtu.be/MLLa7b-z6Q8\">a tinny Casio parp-a-long</a>. Much better is the current Comedy Central series hosted by Dara \u00d3 Briain, wisely <a href=\"https://youtu.be/l_cdoTqd8Pc\">revisiting the original with some added Stranger Things synthwave vibes</a>.

The slick but bland 2010 reboot couldn\u2019t quite match that record \u2013 it wrapped-up a decade-long, 240-episode, run earlier this month \u2013 but can still hold its head up high. Would it be reductive to suggest the modern version would have run aground far earlier if it had messed with <a href=\"https://youtu.be/AepyGm9Me6w\">the rollicking original theme by Morton Stevens</a>, a track that instantly inspires anyone in the surrounding area to mime a canoeing motion? Perhaps, but <a href=\"https://youtu.be/E3haZoHepUw\">embracing those exuberant retro vibes</a> helped give Hawaii Five-O V2.0 some much-needed personality.</p>",
  "<p>A major research project into one of the world\u2019s most popular and captivating paintings has revealed new secrets but the most tantalising question remains: just who was the girl with a pearl earring?</p> <p>Researchers at <a href=\"https://www.mauritshuis.nl/en/explore/the-collection/artworks/girl-with-a-pearl-earring-670/\">the Mauritshuis gallery in The Hague</a> on Tuesday revealed the results of extensive investigations into its star painting, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/nov/02/art\">Johannes Vermeer\u2019s Girl with a Pearl Earring</a>, thought to date from about 1665. </p> <p>The Netherlands\u2019 researchers were stunned to discover, for the first time, delicate eyelashes on the girl\u2019s face and evidence of a green curtain behind her head. They have also gained fresh insights into how Vermeer painted the work, what changes he made and which pigments he used, including discovering that the white for the earring originated in England\u2019s Peak District.</p> <p>But the biggest mystery endures and that is a good thing, said Abbie Vandivere, the head of <a href=\"https://www.mauritshuis.nl/en/explore/restoration-and-research/girl-with-a-blog/\">The Girl in the Spotlight</a> research project.</p> <p>\u201cWe were able to find out so much about Vermeer\u2019s materials and techniques but we still don\u2019t know exactly who the girl is,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is good that some mysteries remain and everyone can speculate about her. It allows people their own personal interpretation of the girl; everyone feels their own connection with the way she meets your eyes.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that she is still a mystery keeps people coming back and keeps her exciting and fresh.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"65f911dab8bcf9876ad3f23be2645a0dc44a3c12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65f911dab8bcf9876ad3f23be2645a0dc44a3c12/71_0_1777_1067/1000.jpg\" alt=\"close-up of Girl with the Pearl Earring\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Mauritshuis found that the blue paint was made from the semi-precious stone lapis lazuli, from what is now Afghanistan.

A similar argument was made for the formless expanse behind her.</p> <p>Both discoveries \u201cput the girl in a defined space and bring us a lot closer to her\u201d, said Vandivere. They suggest Vermeer was faithfully observing and painting a real person in a real space.</p> <p>Speculating on who the girl was, with her enigmatic expression, wide eyes, unusual blue turban and huge pearl earring, remains part of the fun.</p> <p>The novelist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/feb/16/tracy-chevalier-vermeer-girl-with-pearl-earring-world-tour\">Tracy Chevalier</a>, in her book Girl with a Pearl Earring, which became a successful film, imagines the character as a maid in Vermeer\u2019s house who is persuaded to secretly pose for him.</p> <p> The Mauritshuis research has also brought us closer to Vermeer\u2019s painting techniques, said Vandivere, showing how he began composing the painting in various shades of brown and black before adding the colours, working systematically from the background to the foreground.</p> <p>The pearl itself is an illusion in that \u201cit has no contour and also no hook to hang it from the girl\u2019s ear\u201d, she said.</p> <p>Researchers also discovered changes Vermeer made, including shifting the position of the ear, the top of the headscarf and the back of the neck.</p> <p>Researchers have been able to pinpoint where the raw materials for the colours came from. Vermeer would have bought them in his home town of Delft, but the lead ore in his white would have come from the Peak District; the cochineal in his red was made from insects that lived on cacti in Mexico and South America; and the blue in the headscarf was made from the semi-precious stone lapis lazuli, from what is now Afghanistan. It is surprising how much he used, said Vandivere, because in the 17th century it would have been more precious than gold.</p> <p>The director of the Mauritshuis, Martine Gosselink, said: \u201cThe girl hasn\u2019t revealed the secret of her identity yet but we got to know her a little better. This is not the end point of our research.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>One for dreams, one for writing down things you might otherwise forget, one for composing drafts and organising your thoughts: in the end, they all get mixed up, but that\u2019s half the fun of keeping notebooks.

Literature is, after all, meant to be improving. And some people think they can always improve on what someone else has written or painted or drawn.

You\u2019d hardly want to be seen writing in the <a href=\"https://flashbak.com/photographs-of-the-famous-cafe-de-flore-in-paris-409903/\">Caf\u00e9 de Flore</a> in Paris, would you, no matter how high-flown your topic. Only tourists go there now, and probably get a little thrill writing things while they sip their coffee, just to get an inkling of what it must feel like to be writing in the Caf\u00e9 de Flore. Once it would have been postcards, but now they post their little selfies on Instagram, with notes that say: \u201c<em>I am writing this in Caf\u00e9 de Flore, can you believe it?\u201d</em>All too easily, unfortunately.</p> <p>Rubbing their knees together in delight under the tabletop, and squeezing their eyes shut until they feel the blood roaring in their ears, they overflow with glee, and with the urge to communicate their excitement, achieved by grinning inanely to the stranger at the next table, hoping they\u2019ll get one back. It might be a famous writer they\u2019re grinning at, although it seems unlikely. Artists and thinkers rarely go there now, nor to the nearby <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Deux_Magots\">Les Deux Magots</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/05/sunday-with-hans-ulrich-obrist-i-go-to-london-zoo-mostly-for-the-architecture\">Hans</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/05/sunday-with-hans-ulrich-obrist-i-go-to-london-zoo-mostly-for-the-architecture\">-Ulrich Obrist hasn\u2019t swung by </a>to interview anyone there for months.

As used by Vincent van Gogh, the advertising for the notebook also tells us. Perhaps the notebooks played a part in the reasons Van Gogh shot himself, when he could no longer bear people seeing him, sitting in a bar and composing his begging letters to his brother in his little Moleskine. Nowadays he\u2019d have a begging-letter template set up on his laptop, and we would be spared a great deal of his misery. He could just as easily send a text message, saying: \u201cGet me out of here, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/1999/jan/28/arttheft.art\">Dr Gachet</a> is completely unbearable, we were having a chat in his office and I had to go and calm down in a cafe, but the people in there were terrible, it was full of foreign tourists, you\u2019ve no idea what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jul/05/les-rencontres-d-arles-photography-festival-libuse-jarcovjakova\">Arles</a> is like these days, so I went for a walk in this cornfield and now there\u2019s no coverage, I can\u2019t get a signal to call you, and there\u2019s nowhere else I can go and no one I can turn to.

They picked my pocket. I was returning home from visiting my aunt, who was in a coma in hospital. I didn\u2019t have a book with me that day and so whiled away the hours drawing her, on what turned out to be her deathbed. She just lay there, breathing heavily. What I really mean is snoring, at a volume quite out of proportion to her still and tiny body. The nurses had left the window open beside her, it was early autumn, and I think they hoped she would catch pneumonia and die. Not that she\u2019d have noticed. They probably needed the bed. Anyhow, I had made several drawings of the unmoving figure of my aunt, and some bastard in the station stole my notebook, probably thinking it was a wallet. Much good may it have done them. As soon as they realised what a worthless object they had in their hands, they probably tossed it in the nearest bin without even glancing at the drawings, much less my notes. And I doubt they spent any time correcting whatever infelicities of my pen they found among my scribbled pages. Perhaps they looked at the drawings and thought the perspective was a bit off. Mine certainly was, that day.</p>",

They have a relationship with the landlord, so I imagine that is a discussion they will have with the landlord to determine how much has the landlord been able to recoup and can that be offset against any loss of rent claim that\u2019s been made.</p> \n  <p><strong>Leigh:</strong> Are you encouraging your members to pursue tenants? </p> \n  <p><strong>Whelan:</strong> No, we\u2019re not encouraging them to do so, but it is up to individual insurers to make their own arrangements with their relationship with the landlord. But it\u2019s really again around community expectations as well. But <strong>they are contracts at the end of the day that have been entered into, and the insurers are abiding by those contracts and so too the tenants should be as well. </strong></p> \n  <p><strong>Leigh: </strong>It hardly seems in the spirit of things though. There\u2019s a range of rent moratoriums that are being put in place as a result of Covid-19. Landlords are suffering some of that pain, and are then turning to their insurer, and you\u2019re telling me you think it would be alright if the insurer then went back and sued the tenant?</p> \n  <p><strong>Whelan</strong>: No, what I\u2019m saying is they need to take into account the community expectations and the degree to which they\u2019re able to absorb that is really their own individual decisions. That\u2019s something that the company must take onboard themselves and decide themselves. It is down to the individual companies to make those decisions. We encourage and provide information to them, but at the end of the day it\u2019s an individual company decision to make. </p> \n  <p><strong>Leigh:</strong> I think we can be pretty sure about what the community sentiment would be on this. I\u2019m just surprised that the Insurance Council doesn\u2019t have an approach to it, that you\u2019re essentially taking this hands off, \u2018it\u2019s up to our members\u2019 approach to what could turn out to be quite a serious problem.</p> \n  <p><strong>Whelan: </strong>Well, I wouldn\u2019t quite characterise it like that. We do monitor the situation and feed back what we believe are the issues that insurers should be taking into account when they are making these sorts of decisions. So it\u2019s not that we\u2019re absent in this discussion. We are participants in it obviously, because we want to make sure that the industry\u2019s reputation is held high. So that\u2019s an expectation on our behalf. And there\u2019s also a code of practise, which they\u2019re expected to abide by, which goes to issues around financial hardship and people in vulnerable positions. And that has some quite strong requirements on those particular companies to be able to abide by that code of practise.

The violence prevention not-for-profit Youth Alive! brought a hospital-based violence intervention program to Highland hospital in the 1990s. Several other programs have emerged in the region since then, and they have been credited with contributing to the decrease in gun violence in the Bay Area over the past 10 years.</p> <p>\u201cWhen people are in the hospital and in crisis they need guidance through that moment,\u201d says Kyndra Simmons, the Youth Alive! intervention director. \u201cSome people just want to feel safe again.

The pair had been out clubbing after Posey broke up with his girlfriend earlier in the day, and they were recapping the night when several men walked up and tried to jack the car.</p> <p>As Posey and his friend sped<strong> </strong>off, the would-be robbers opened fire from behind.

The constant pain, the magnitude of losing my ability to walk and having to relearn stuff,\u201d Posey recalls of his time in rehabilitation. \u201cI had to learn how to close my hand so I could write. I had to learn how to get dressed by myself, use the bathroom, shower by myself and take care of myself.\u201d</p> <p>Posey spent six months in Fairmont\u2019s acute rehabilitation and another three months in the facility\u2019s long-term nursing department. Meanwhile, a local not-for-profit that helps people with disabilities found him a wheelchair-accessible apartment where he could live on his own. Eventually he moved into an apartment in San Leandro, where he\u2019s been for the past three years.<strong> </strong>Although he was denied victim\u2019s compensation funds by the state board, he receives social security, and disability benefits from the state.</p> <p>Before the shooting<strong> </strong>that left him paralyzed, Posey envisioned \u201ca life of grandeur\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cMy expectation was being able to make a lot of money playing sports or being a performer,\u201d he said. \u201cI was really into the materialistic side of what life offers.\u201d</p> <p>After his injury, his first priority was to simply regain independence. He now drives himself around in a car that has been modified with hand controls in lieu of gas and brake pedals. His social life centers around the kickbacks in friends\u2019 homes and events like Golden State Warriors championship parades. Navigating his first parade as a wheelchair user was \u201cridiculous\u201d, he recalled. At one point he found himself stuck on a walking bridge. \u201cYou trying to get out of the crowd bro?\u201d, a<strong> </strong>group of parade-goers asked<strong>,</strong> before lifting him, wheelchair and all, over a railing and out of the thick crowd.</p> <p>\u201cIt was funny for the most part because these people didn\u2019t know me from a can of paint,\u201d Posey recalled. \u201cIt\u2019s cool to see that there are people who are willing to help other people.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--immersive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F5bda476bc41b8bdd12e923eb939912c21fb8fdd4%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3138_2092&amp;left-caption=&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fac12657e72e020422547daef46847b09e2a20920%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3240_2160&amp;right-caption=&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\" data-alt=\"Jeremy Posey\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F5bda476bc41b8bdd12e923eb939912c21fb8fdd4%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3138_2092&left-caption=&right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fac12657e72e020422547daef46847b09e2a20920%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3240_2160&right-caption=&always-place-captions-below=false\">Jeremy Posey</a> <figcaption>Jeremy Posey was left permanently paralyzed after being shot in his friends car.

Posey says he\u2019s lost friends to gun violence and attended functions that ended in shootouts.</p> <p>And two years before her own injury, Gutierrez\u2019s brother\u2019s head was grazed by a bullet during a Halloween party.

I couldn\u2019t go into my classroom and pay attention to what was happening. I started cutting class and smoking weed to cope.</p> <p>Eventually, Gutierrez, who played for Golden Bear Volleyball Club, UC Berkeley\u2019s youth team, was expelled from school.</p> <p>\u201cThat was the wrong way to respond to the trauma I was displaying,\u201d Gutierrez says of school administrators\u2019 response to her behavior. \u201cThose were very normal behaviors that people experiencing gun violence and trauma begin to take on.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Rochelle Dicker, a University of San Francisco trauma surgeon, has seen countless gunshot wound victims in her almost two-decades-long career.</p> <p>When someone comes into a trauma center after being shot the \u201cair is a lot thicker with tension and anxiety\u201d than it is during other emergencies, Dicker says.

In 2012, the US Department of Justice <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/defendingchildhood/cev-rpt-full.pdf\">recommended</a> that more HVIPs should be developed across the country. According to a <a href=\"https://lawcenter.giffords.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Healing-Communities-in-Crisis-URL.pdf\">2016 report</a> from the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, HVIPs combine effective gun violence reduction practices like focused deterrence and connecting people with employment resources.</p> <p>The report argues the programs are ultimately also cost-savers. Hospital treatment for a non-fatal gunshot wound patient typically amounts to around $24,000. The total costs of a single instance of gun violence can be up to six figures, when incarceration and families\u2019 income loss are included. Dicker\u2019s Wraparound Project is credited with saving UCSF an estimated $500,000 a year.</p> <p>Both Gutierrez and Posey received support from Youth Alive!\u2019s HVIP.

  "<h2>Trump\u2019s focus on judges started back on the 2016 campaign trail</h2> <p>Donald Trump made many promises on the campaign trail in 2016. He promised to build a border wall and make Mexico pay for it. He promised to resurrect American industry.</p> <p>And he promised to fill the courts with conservative judges, understood to mean judges who were skeptical of environmental regulations, who were not enthralled with the legacy of the civil rights era and who took a narrow view of a woman\u2019s right to choose.</p> <p>To combat doubts about his conservative credentials, Trump took the unusual step of releasing, while still a candidate, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/18/donald-trump-supreme-court-picks-conservatives\">a list of his potential picks</a> for the US supreme court. The list was curated by the Federalist Society, the country\u2019s largest organization of conservative legal activists. For evangelical Christians and other groups, the list signaled that Trump was a safe White House pick.</p> <h2>Has Trump delivered on his promises on judges?</h2> <p>As Trump\u2019s first term winds down, there is no great border wall, and no resurgent manufacturing sector. But the highest hopes of Trump\u2019s evangelical supporters have been realized, as the president has made good on his promise to fill the federal bench with a new brand of conservative judge \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/01/28/judicial-appointments-in-trumps-first-three-years-myths-and-realities/\">younger</a>, more ideologically committed and <a href=\"https://www.acslaw.org/judicial-nominations/diversity-of-the-federal-bench/\">less diverse</a> than their peers.</p> <p>At the circuit court level, Trump has installed 51 judges, or about 30% of all active judgeships, just one step before the US supreme court. He is preparing to fill dozens of district court vacancies. Most significantly of all, Trump has appointed two justices to the supreme court, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, out of nine total.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Trump\u2019s%20court%20takeover&amp;description=This%20series%20examines%20the%20historic%20pace%20and%20nature%20of%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20remaking%20of%20the%20federal%20courts%20and%20the%20conservative%20agenda%20it%20will%20usher%20in%20on%20a%20range%20of%20issues%20from%20voting%20rights%20to%20climate%20and%20from%20healthcare%20to%20criminal%20justice&amp;read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2Fseries%2Ftrumps-court-takeover&amp;links=false\" data-alt=\"series linker\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&title=Trump\u2019s%20court%20takeover&description=This%20series%20examines%20the%20historic%20pace%20and%20nature%20of%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20remaking%20of%20the%20federal%20courts%20and%20the%20conservative%20agenda%20it%20will%20usher%20in%20on%20a%20range%20of%20issues%20from%20voting%20rights%20to%20climate%20and%20from%20healthcare%20to%20criminal%20justice&read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2Fseries%2Ftrumps-court-takeover&links=false\">series linker</a> </figure>  <h2>Are the judges powerful?</h2> <p>Together these judges wield immense power over who gets to vote, who gets to marry, who has access to healthcare, who carries a gun, who is branded a criminal, who may join a union, who is protected from discrimination and who has permission to discriminate on religious grounds.</p> <p>Pervasive influence on the federal judiciary is an immense prize, with implications spanning generations, given that federal judgeships are lifetime appointments. And it is a prize, analysts say, that Trump has handed the conservative movement, creating a powerful bulwark for his own political fortunes.</p> <p>\u201cThese judges have all been vetted in terms of judicial philosophy,\u201d said Sheldon Goldman, a professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who focuses on the federal bench. \u201cAll believe in a bench that is not activist in terms of promoting civil libertarian values.

Trump also has benefited from dozens of retirements by judges who were appointed by previous Republican presidents.</p> <p>But his best friend in the effort has been Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, who by blocking nominees under Barack Obama helped create 17 appeals court vacancies for Trump when he took office, more than any of his recent predecessors. McConnell also held a supreme court seat open for Trump, and he has changed Senate rules to speed the confirmation of Trump judges.</p> <h2>Have Trump\u2019s judges made any impact yet?</h2> <p>While experts advise that it could take five years or more for the full picture to develop of how Trump\u2019s judges are changing the courts, and the country, signs are emerging of a potential phase shift.</p> <p>Formerly reliable progressive benches have issued rulings that threaten access to reproductive healthcare, while others have greenlighted the Trump administration\u2019s most reckless attacks on voting rights and on vulnerable populations, from the disabled to victims of police abuse to asylum seekers.</p> <p>The supreme court, meanwhile, has consistently sided with Trump administration requests for emergency relief from lower court rulings against executive actions by Trump to create a wealth test for green card applicants, divert Pentagon funding for a border wall, ban transgender individuals from the military and more.</p> <h2>What is at stake in these changes?</h2> <p>Goldman expressed general confidence in the health of the judiciary and said many Trump judicial appointees were qualified for their posts. But he warned of dire consequences if Trump\u2019s judges gave in wholly to the president\u2019s desire to prosecute his political enemies and destroy the free press.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a president who has authoritarian instincts,\u201d said Goldman. \u201cWe have a president who is rather vindictive. That\u2019s really the big issue now \u2013 whether the constitution of the United States, the bill of rights, will survive Trump.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>For all the extravagant projects of the Donald Trump presidency, and for all its flamboyance and bluster, his makeover of the judiciary \u2013 a quieter project that has been ratcheted forward by a network of quieter people \u2013 may prove to have the longest and most far-reaching impacts on the daily lives of Americans.</p> <p>All new presidents change the courts by filling vacancies. But what is only now coming into focus is the impact that Trump\u2019s unprecedented number of judicial appointments is having on the courts, ruling by ruling, and on the day-to-day lives of Americans, in areas such as healthcare, voting rights, criminal justice, anti-discrimination efforts and the climate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=51%20&amp;title=active%20circuit%20court%20judges%20are%20Trump%20picks%2C%20almost%2030%25%20of%20the%20total%20bench\" data-alt=\"judges\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&number=51%20&title=active%20circuit%20court%20judges%20are%20Trump%20picks%2C%20almost%2030%25%20of%20the%20total%20bench\">judges</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe change is happening. It\u2019s happening before our very eyes,\u201d said Sheldon Goldman, a professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who focuses on the federal bench.</p> <p>While the US supreme court is the country\u2019s highest judicial authority and attracts most national and international attention, it is the country\u2019s appeals courts that have the last word on justice in the vast majority of cases. They hear thousands of cases each year, compared with the 100-150 the supreme court typically hears. And largely unlike the British court system, federal judges in the United States are selected by politicians in a process that has become an intense area of focus for outside partisans.</p> <p>Trump has notched more confirmations of appeals court judges, faster, than any president at a similar stage in history, a record he frequently gloats about and <a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2019/11/trumps-exaggerated-judicial-boasts/\">cannot resist inflating</a>.</p> <p>Trump has appointed 51 out of the 179 active circuit court judges, or almost 30% of the entire bench, and next month the total is expected to hit 53. By comparison, Barack Obama appointed 55 circuit court judges and George W Bush appointed 62 \u2013 in eight years each. Trump\u2019s judges, who can serve for life, have a starting <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/01/28/judicial-appointments-in-trumps-first-three-years-myths-and-realities/\">median age</a> of 48.2, compared with 52.8 for Obama and 51 for Bush.

In 2018, when a district judge in the ninth circuit blocked Trump restrictions on asylum applications, Trump tweet-raged <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1065581119242940416\">that</a> \u201cthe 9th Circuit is a complete &amp; total disaster\u201d and \u201cout of control\u201d with \u201ca horrible reputation\u201d.</p> <p>In the last two years, however, the ninth circuit has changed.</p> <p>Court vacancies and ruthless engineering by McConnell have allowed Trump to install 10 new judges on the ninth circuit, which with 29 active judges total is by far the biggest in the land. When the family planning cases landed before the court last year, two Trump appointees were selected at random to sit on an 11-member ruling panel.</p> <p>In late February, the court handed down its decision. The judges split 7-4 precisely according to the party identities of their appointing presidents. To the shock of longtime observers of the federal courts, the ruling greenlighted Trump\u2019s family planning restrictions \u2013 with the sure result, <a href=\"http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2020/02/24/19-15974_opinion.pdf\">in the words</a> of dissenting Judge Richard Paez, that \u201cwomen and their families will suffer for it\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe majority disregards 20 years of progress, insistent on hauling the paternalism of the past into the present,\u201d Paez wrote. He quoted a district judge in Oregon: \u201cThis is madness.\u201d</p> <p>But as shocking as the ruling might have been, scholars saw in the ninth circuit decision a clear augury, \u201ca precursor for what we\u2019re likely to see in the future,\u201d according to Carl Tobias, a professor at Richmond School of Law specializing in federal judicial selection.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a classic case that shows you how much power these new judges have,\u201d Tobias said. \u201cThat\u2019s a concrete example of the changing dynamics of that court.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7362ffe8933902d010b40c05daf9cf66beaca4a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7362ffe8933902d010b40c05daf9cf66beaca4a6/0_260_6062_3638/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Asylum seekers wait for their turn to cross to the United States at El Chaparral crossing port on the US-Mexico border in Tijuana, Baja California state, Mexico, on 29 February 2020.

In fact, a 63% majority of Trump judges replaced judges who had been appointed by previous Republican presidents, according to <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/01/28/judicial-appointments-in-trumps-first-three-years-myths-and-realities/\">analysis by</a> Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institute.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s just a little early to begin making determined judgments about how much things have changed on the courts of appeals,\u201d Wheeler said.</p> <p>But the data is beginning to pile up, in rulings starting at the top \u2013 the supreme court, where Trump has installed two justices out of nine, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch.

In December, a Trump judge on the court joined a two-to-one majority attacking Obama\u2019s healthcare law, ruling that the former \u201cindividual mandate\u201d to carry health insurance was unconstitutional. Other judges on the court have joined controversial opinions on <a href=\"http://www.pfaw.org/blog-posts/trump-judges-deciding-vote-allows-trump-to-spend-3-6-billion-on-border-wall-despite-injunction-against-it-confirmed-judges-confirmed-fears/\">border wall construction</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pfaw.org/blog-posts/trump-judge-tries-to-give-white-voters-another-chance-to-prove-racial-discrimination-claim-confirmed-judges-confirmed-fears/\">voting rights</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pfaw.org/blog-posts/trump-circuit-judges-reaffirm-decision-undermining-fair-housing-act-confirmed-judges-confirmed-fears/\">fair housing</a>.</p> <p>Even in cases where Trump judges replaced judges appointed by an earlier Republican, Trump\u2019s judges as a group espouse a more extreme conservative philosophy \u2013 which may be enhanced in practice if the judges see their appeals court jobs as tryouts for the US supreme court.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that at least some of them are doing their judging with one eye on the health of Ruth Ginsburg and Steve Breyer,\u201d said Wheeler. \u201cWondering, \u2018what can I do to persuade the administration that I\u2019d be a great person to appoint to the supreme court?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In critiquing the recent ninth circuit decision on family planning, Paez warned that Trump\u2019s judges were seeking to turn back the clock of American jurisprudence.</p> <p>\u201cThe majority would return us to an older world, one in which a government bureaucrat could restrict a medical professional from informing a patient of the full range of healthcare options available to her,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>\u201cI strongly dissent.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>\u201cMost of the time, you fail; there are many more defeats than victories,\u201d Juan Antonio Pizzi says. He is right, even when it comes to his peer group \u2013 possibly the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/apr/11/barcelona-coaching-champions-league\">most successful coaching class in history</a> \u2013 but it is still an unusual reflection for a man who was La Liga\u2019s top scorer and, as a player and manager, won the league in three countries. All the more so when it is a reflection prompted by the time he led Chile to the 2016 Copa Am\u00e9rica. Minutes after winning the final, Pizzi sat before the press \u2013 and started talking about failure.</p> <p>He laughs now but there was a lesson there. \u201cIt\u2019s true: when you take over a team, most of the objectives you set, you fail to meet,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd however much you try to console yourself with your style, methodology, some improvement, what you want is to win and when you don\u2019t, which is most of the time, disappointment comes. You lose more than you win and your mind is occupied more with defeat than enjoying victory, which is gone very quickly.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/27/cambuur-captain-im-still-angry-its-an-unbelievable-decision\">\u2018This is horrible': Cambuur stunned after dream season turns to dust</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So, why do it? Pizzi laughs again. <em>Because</em>. As he looks over his career there is plenty of chance; as he looks at <em>that</em> team, the one that may have been the origin of his coaching career, it can feel like fate. Alongside him as Barcelona kicked off the 1996-97 season were Julen Lopetegui, Pep Guardiola and Luis Enrique. In fact, of that XI only two didn\u2019t become coaches \u2013 and both stayed in football \u2013 and only five members of the squad didn\u2019t become managers or sporting directors, and that includes a scout, a president and a candidate to head Fifa. Even the translator became a coach. You\u2019ll have heard of him.</p> <p>\u201cJos\u00e9 Mourinho was very, very intelligent; he absorbed knowledge and methodology very fast,\u201d Pizzi says. \u201cBut no, no one imagined this. In fact, he was very respectful, very aware of his role, although he was astute in learning from both managers.\u201d The first of those was Bobby Robson, the second Louis van Gaal, and Pizzi learned from them too. They all did. So much so that when Pizzi is asked whether there\u2019s an explanation for that team producing so many managers, he responds swiftly: \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRobson would get names wrong and we\u2019d be there shooting looks at each other, going along with it. But he was fundamental: he had to lead Barcelona through the hardest era in 20 years, making that post-Cruyff period as trauma-free as possible. That was his great virtue. He was old school, close to the players, and the lessons from him were not just about football, they were human. He was an exceptional person and whenever we meet up, we remember him fondly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b702751c07bea52bae2671ab3a5b1bec41eaf5d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b702751c07bea52bae2671ab3a5b1bec41eaf5d2/0_217_2656_1594/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bobby Robson with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho (left) and Ronaldo after winning the European Cup Winners Cup with Barcelona.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bobby Robson with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho (left) and Ronaldo after winning the European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup with Barcelona.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colorsport/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHe and Van Gaal used different means, let\u2019s say. One was emotive, human; the other, Louis, based his work more on tactical knowledge, structure. There was respect but it was ideas and his ideas were genuinely different. Barcelona came from a Dutch footballing culture with Cruyff and Van Gaal shared that but it was very theoretical, very methodical, analytical. I\u2019ve been lucky with the coaches I played for and you take things from all of them.\u201d</p> <p>Not that those things necessarily added up to managerial material. After retiring, Pizzi and his wife opened a shop selling Argentinian polo gear but that didn\u2019t go well. He advised agents on the signing of players. It wasn\u2019t until later that he went on a coaching course with former Spain and Barcelona teammates in Las Rozas, northwest of Madrid.</p> <p>\u201cAt times your personality opens a pathway and, even if you don\u2019t realise it, you end up being what deep down you really want to be without even knowing it,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were 20 or so of us \u2013 Pep, Luis Enrique, Nadal, Alkorta, Salinas, Ferrer \u2013 and we went in part because we had time to fill, but you start to feel ideas forming, you learn, begin to wonder if you can do this, if you can sit in a job interview and convince.\u201d</p> <p>One colleague and friend was already convinced. \u201cPep had such conviction in his footballing vision,\u201d Pizzi says. \u201cHe has brought those to England; football there had already evolved a lot but he represented a change and you can see his identity on that team. He doesn\u2019t need to win the Champions League for people to appreciate that. A coach doesn\u2019t need a title, which depends on so many factors, to express his virtues; the analysis has to look beyond that. It\u2019s like Messi: he doesn\u2019t have to win a World Cup to prove he\u2019s the most transcendental player in history.\u201d</p> <p>Pizzi speaks as one who denied Messi an international title. Having coached in Argentina, Peru, Chile, Mexico and Spain, Pizzi got the Chile job in 2016. He was not first choice, he knows, and talks openly of coincidence and chance, of luck, of opportunity arriving out of the blue, but he led them to the final with players such as Claudio Bravo, Eduardo Vargas and Arturo Vidal \u2013 \u201ca completely different person to the perception that many have of him because of the way he looks, the image that he projects: super professional, super respectful, a very good teammate, a man of solidarity\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b6535853cfa90d6aa51473566ff897b78da6d752\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6535853cfa90d6aa51473566ff897b78da6d752/0_573_3280_4314/760.jpg\" alt=\"Juan Antonio Pizzi speaks to Alexis S\u00e1nchez during Chile training in 2016.\" width=\"760\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Juan Antonio Pizzi speaks to Alexis S\u00e1nchez during Chile training in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nelson Almeida/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alexis S\u00e1nchez, too. \u201cAlexis was in a perfect place at Arsenal,\u201d Pizzi says, \u201cand suddenly he changes city, coach, teammates, fans [by joining Manchester United] ... sometimes that adaptation happens quickly, sometimes it takes longer. In Alexis\u2019s case, I think it took too long. He didn\u2019t seem to be able to connect and emotionally he dropped. The consequences of that state of mind were translated in his performances. I don\u2019t know what destiny holds for him but I think this experience in Italy [at Internazionale], away from English football, might be good for him. I really hope so. I\u2019m sure that if he can find tranquillity and his form, he\u2019ll be very important for United.\u201d</p> <p>In the final Chile beat Messi\u2019s Argentina. Pizzi\u2019s Argentina, too. As a player he had made his Spain debut against the country of his birth; now as a manager he had denied them. \u201cThe truth is, I didn\u2019t enjoy it fully. Of course I was happy my team had won but I couldn\u2019t rid myself of my feelings for Argentina. That\u2019s a risk you take on when you work for another national team; It\u2019s not a pleasant situation to play against the country where you were born, where your friends are, your family ...\u201d</p> <p>Maybe that touch of melancholy was there in what he said at the end? Maybe, but Pizzi sees it as realism. As he celebrated, he knew losses had led him there and more would follow. That\u2019s about all he knows for sure, all any of us do. Like everyone, he is in lockdown, back in Argentina. There, he waits. And then, there is no plan. Is England an option? \u201cOf course. It\u2019s a great league, the best in the world, an aspiration for all coaches. But football takes you: it\u2019s the game that decides. Football leads you down the path football wants, not the one you map out.\u201d</p>",

She has made an appeal in 17 languages to the 3,500 detainees who were held in the centre during the five-month period that a young whistleblowing employee secretly filmed his colleagues abusing detainees, asking them to come forward to give evidence.</p> <p>In the spring of 2017 Callum Tulley told the BBC that he was witnessing abuse of detainees during his work as a junior officer at Brook House, and agreed to wear an undercover camera for a number of months. He filmed one G4S officer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/25/immigration-detainee-allegedly-choked-g4s-guard-demands-public-inquiry-panorama-home-office\">throttling a detainee</a>, digging his fingers into the man\u2019s neck and whispering in his ear: \u201cDon\u2019t move, you fucking piece of shit, I\u2019m going to put you to fucking sleep.\u201d</p> <p>He recorded others bullying inmates, making dehumanised comments, and showing no sensitivity towards detainees who were self-harming and suicidal. Tulley was occasionally moved to tears by the brutality he witnessed.

It flagged up staff shortages and an ineffective whistleblowing structure as contributing factors to events. The Home Office\u2019s professional standards unit also launched an internal investigation and both the <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/home-affairs-committee/inquiries/parliament-2017/inquiry/\">home affairs select committee</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.nao.org.uk/report/home-offices-management-of-its-contract-with-g4s-to-run-brook-house-immigration-removal-centre/\">National Audit Office</a> conducted reviews.

  "<p>If Ovidiu Olea is astonished by the fact that he\u2019s gone from being a finance guy to a mask mogul in four months, he shows no sign of it. The transition started innocuously. Late in January, when the coronavirus spread beyond Wuhan, Olea decided he would buy masks for his staff. He lives in Hong Kong, where he runs a payment technology firm. His staff isn\u2019t large \u2013 just 20 employees \u2013 but finding even a few hundred masks proved hard. Part of the problem was that last year, after protesters in Hong Kong used masks to hide their identity, the Chinese government restricted supplies from the mainland. Before the pandemic, half the world\u2019s masks were manufactured in China; now, with production there shifting into overdrive, that figure may be <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-the-richest-country-on-earth-cant-get-you-a-face-mask-11585741254\" title=\"\">as high as 85%</a>. If China isn\u2019t sending you masks, you likely aren\u2019t getting any at all. We have no masks, local pharmacies told Olea, but if you find some, we\u2019ll buy them from you.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/11/how-the-face-mask-became-the-worlds-most-coveted-commodity-podcast\">How the face mask became the world's most coveted commodity \u2013 podcast</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Olea got to work. In a journal article, he read that epidemiologists spoke highly of N95 respirators, masks that filter out 95% of small particulate matter. Stealing time out of his day job, Olea began phoning N95 suppliers in Mexico, Turkey, Indonesia, Ireland. Each one turned him down. \u201cThe answers ranged from \u2018No\u2019 to \u2018We only sell to accredited buyers\u2019 to \u2018Come back next year,\u2019\u201d Olea told me. After three days, Olea found a South African firm named North Safety Products, which had 500,000 masks in stock. Olea bought them all, at less than a pound per mask, certain that he would be able to sell the surplus.</p> \n<p>During their conversations, North Safety Products executives warned Olea to be careful. There were \u201cinterested parties\u201d lurking outside its factory gates, ready to bribe truck drivers for their cargoes. Olea hired a security detail to ride alongside his truck of masks as it drove to the airport in Johannesburg. (He sent me a photo of the team: six grim men packing pistols and rifles, clad in camo and bulletproof vests. \u201cThey asked if I wanted machine guns as well. I thought not. We\u2019re not invading Lesotho. Let\u2019s keep it reasonable.\u201d) In mid-February, two weeks after he placed his order, his shipment touched down in Hong Kong. Within six hours, the buyers he had signed up had collected nearly all of the masks. \u201cEven if I\u2019d had 5m masks,\u201d Olea said, \u201cI\u2019d have sold out.\u201d</p> \n<p>Olea, who has a keen nose for business opportunities, quickly became possessed by this new line of work. Since February, as the pandemic has streaked around the planet, he has bought and sold on another million N95 masks from North Safety Products. In March, Olea became a middleman for Chinese-made three-ply masks, too, the simple kind that just about everyone everywhere is now opting to wear. He sold masks to the Hong Kong government, to European countries, via their diplomats in Hong Kong and China, and to European companies, which wanted them for their employees. All told, Olea reckons he\u2019s sold about 48m of them.</p> \n<p>By April, Olea decided he might as well take the next step. He bought a mask-making machine from a Chinese manufacturer: an eight-metre-long assembly line, which shapes and cuts sheets of plastic into masks. When I spoke to him, in mid-April, I was reading about mask prices close to \u00a36 a pop, and Olea was waiting with giddy excitement for his machine to reach him. He was still running his payments firm, and masks were a departure from that work. \u201cBut these are weird times,\u201d he insisted. \u201cWe all must do something to survive.\u201d</p> \n<p>No object better symbolises the pandemic than the mask, and no object better explains the world into which the pandemic arrived. Social distancing, at first, felt like a strange notion: the inaction of it, the vagueness of it. But the mask sang out to our deepest consumeristic impulses. In the absence of a drug or a vaccine, the mask is the only material protection we can buy; it\u2019s a product, and we\u2019ve been trained like seals to respond to products. As a result, in every corner of every country, the humble face mask \u2013 this assembly of inexpensive plastic \u2013 has been elevated into a fetishised commodity. One mask broker described it as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/market-for-chinese-made-masks-is-a-madhouse-says-broker\" title=\"\">a madhouse</a>\u201d, another as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddisalvo/2020/03/30/i-spent-a-day-in-the-coronavirus-driven-feeding-frenzy-of-n95-mask-sellers-and-buyers-and-this-is-what-i-learned/#199e11b356d4\" title=\"\">the craziest market I\u2019ve ever seen</a>\u201d.</p> \n<p>Countries have hoarded masks, and used them as chips in geopolitical games.

We already have MaskClub.com which, like a \u201cjam of the month\u201d club, offers $9.99-a-month mask subscriptions: the best-beloved business model of hipster e-commerce. Last year, an industry insider told me, Burberry had toyed with the notion of putting face masks on some of its models during a catwalk show \u2013 a wink, perhaps, at our apocalyptic future. By March, things had become real, and the fashion house <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2020/03/30/burberry-making-gowns-masks-nhs-12479187/\" title=\"\">was pledging</a> to make masks and gowns for the UK\u2019s NHS. From a healthcare perspective, the mask was a matter of life and death. But it also took on the function of a talisman \u2013 as an object to hang comfortingly between the body and a diseased society.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e0e4b23bea5e8f048388e938d8d19e552e768430\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0e4b23bea5e8f048388e938d8d19e552e768430/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protective masks hang in a decontamination unit in Somerville, Massachusetts.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protective masks hang in a decontamination unit in Somerville, Massachusetts.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Dwyer/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>All this when no one even seemed to know precisely how useful masks were, or who should wear them. The advice we got was a mess. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/apr/10/world-health-organization-who-v-coronavirus-why-it-cant-handle-pandemic\" title=\"\">World Health Organization</a> maintained, at first, that healthy people had no need for masks. But people bought masks anyway. Shelves were emptied. People improvised. A friend of mine in Tel Aviv ended up fashioning one for herself out of her husband\u2019s boxer shorts \u2013 washed and dried, she assured me, and slid over her head like a balaclava. Then, in early April, the WHO reversed its counsel, and a host of governments followed suit, which sparked a fresh run on mask stocks.</p> \n<p>In this pandemic, the mask reveals far more than it hides. It exposes the world\u2019s political and economic relations for what they are: vectors of self-interest that ordinarily lie obscured under glib talk of globalisation and openness. For the demagogues who govern so much of the world, the pandemic has provided an unimpeachable excuse to fulfil their dearest wishes: to nail national borders shut, to tar every outsider as suspicious, and to act as if their own countries must be preserved above all others.</p> \n<p>When these tendencies combine with a fawning loyalty to the free market, the results can be ruinous. In mere weeks, the mask went from being an urgent human need to a cynically exploited asset in a global resource grab \u2013 the fastest such journey, perhaps, of any product in history. Sometimes, it felt as if the mask itself was beside the point \u2013 that it was just a trigger to rehearse old routines of acquisitiveness and discord, with no further, greater end in sight.</p> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<p>We\u2019ve been living with the coronavirus long enough now that we can distinguish the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/apr/23/coronavirus-face-masks-around-the-world-in-pictures\" title=\"\">various tribes</a> of mask-wearers. Note the shopper in the pasta aisle, clad in a classic white N95 with the 3M manufacturer logo just under the snout. The N95 and its equivalents keep out nearly every particle larger than 0.3 microns, and although the virus is tinier, the fibres in the mask\u2019s layers obstruct its passage. These masks are meant to go first to healthcare workers, which might explain the shopper\u2019s furtive, guilty eyes. Note the finance bro out for his allotted hour of jogging, wearing a Vogmask \u2013 a brand so stylish that its midnight-blue model might even match his suit when he eventually returns to the City. Note the extreme worrier in the GVS Elipse P100, the heavy-duty mask that promises to keep out 99.97% of particles. In the age of Covid-19, the equivalent of sensible shoes may be the simple surgical mask or the home-hemmed cloth. The gaps in their weave are big enough for the virus to pass through, but they do at least protect others from the wearer\u2019s sneezes and coughs.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5d25beb5-14fb-47b4-bd06-0714dbfabc04\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cqLnDhHSJDU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Such deep familiarity with masks is hard-won. The pandemic has brought on a global shortage of masks, which is really a global shortage of one particular plastic inside the masks \u2013 a type of non-woven polypropylene that acts as a filter. In casual conversation, people in the mask business call the plastic \u201cmeltblown\u201d, referring to how its plastic filaments are made. Meltblown goes into many things: jackets, nappies, filters in water purifiers and air conditioners. Masks are in short supply not because they\u2019re difficult to produce, but because the meltblown industry is used to stable, long-term demand. It churns out just enough for its customers and no more. To install an assembly line of meltblown takes many months, even at the calmest of times; with demand now soaring, some companies supplying meltblown equipment are quoting timelines of up to two years to even deliver a new machine.</p> \n<p>Hot out of the plant, meltblown looks like a giant toilet roll: 15,000 yards or so of polypropylene wrapped around a cardboard core. The material feels like synthetic cloth, but it\u2019s so thin that you might accidentally put your finger through it, an executive at one American meltblown manufacturer told me. He asked to keep his and his company\u2019s names out of this article, for a reason I\u2019ve never been given before. They don\u2019t want to be known more widely, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re so overburdened with enquiries already. If any further information gets out, that\u2019s another thousand messages coming in every day. That makes it impossible to do any work.\u201d Until last year, just 2 or 3% of his company\u2019s meltblown went into face masks, he said. This year, it\u2019s 95%.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"16aebaf27d74fc9aaa773114022c1c07576baae1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16aebaf27d74fc9aaa773114022c1c07576baae1/0_301_4941_2966/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manufacturing of meltblown fabric for use in face masks in Chengdu, China.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manufacturing of meltblown fabric for use in face masks in Chengdu, China.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chine Nouvelle/SIPA/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Until now, countries didn\u2019t consider meltblown a strategic commodity, so during the past three decades, much of its production has migrated from the west to low-cost factories in Asia. The executive\u2019s company is one of just five or 10 remaining manufacturers in the US, he said, and China produces close to half of all the meltblown in the world. As a result, the rush for masks provided a compressed, vivid reminder of something we\u2019d been aware of for a couple of decades now: that in all manufacturing and trade, the lines of commerce inevitably bend towards China.</p> \n<p>Early in February, the Chinese government began preventing exports of meltblown, so that the material could first be used to assemble masks for China\u2019s own population. The prospect of being cut off from half the world\u2019s meltblown supply \u201cput the fear of God\u201d into everyone who manufactured anything that contained it, the executive said. The market price of meltblown went up fourfold. He began to get 200 or 300 phone calls a day from mask companies all over the world, demanding meltblown. Even Chinese mask manufacturers rang him, worried that their country might run out. They\u2019d offer cash up front and try to outbid each other. \u201cThey\u2019d say: \u2018Name your price, any price you want to, anything,\u2019 and I\u2019d explain that we don\u2019t do it that way,\u201d said the executive. Then they dangled bribes before him: all-expenses-paid holidays. Just tell us where you want to go.</p> \n<p>Also in February, the Chinese government effectively made itself the sole customer of the major mask-making factories in its territory. This applied to Chinese-owned companies, but also to big mask plants in China owned by foreign firms; their products were earmarked for domestic use and banned from being shipped overseas. On 3 February, in <a href=\"https://guide.jsp.co.uk/statement/JSP%20Coronavirus%20Statement%203%20February%202020.pdf\" title=\"\">an apologetic letter</a> to customers, the British company JSP Safety said that its output of masks was running low, because two of its Chinese factories had been \u201cformally requisitioned by the government to make disposable RPE [respiratory protection equipment] for Chinese government agencies\u201d.</p> \n<p>Christopher Dobbing, who founded the Cambridge Mask Company in 2015, said his own factory in China was small enough to escape the government\u2019s notice, so his inventory wasn\u2019t snapped up by the authorities. But he did see, first-hand, the wave of Chinese panic-buying. \u201cChinese communities everywhere snapped up our masks wherever we had a footprint, so that they could send them home,\u201d Dobbing said. Chinese companies overseas <a href=\"http://www.chinaisa.org.cn/gxportal/xfgl/portal/content.html?articleId=4e44369ab9d5797768fa034525b2aad5c816782b7dd0ee3c401cfc3af43c1c3a&amp;columnId=58af05dfb6b4300151760176d2aad0a04c275aaadbb1315039263f021f920dcd\" title=\"\">were also</a> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-07/china-implores-employees-and-clients-to-scour-world-for-masks\" title=\"\">asked</a> to purchase and ship back masks. On 26 January, Dobbing got 1,200 emails and 400 phone calls. \u201cMaybe they thought we were a huge company, but we were just a couple of guys in an office, panicking as the orders flowed in.\u201d By 28 January, he was taking pre-orders for March.</p> \n<p>Roughly 2bn masks were imported into China in February. To those with a kneejerk mistrust of China\u2019s rulers, it appeared as if, having first failed to contain the disease, they were now ransacking the mask market just when the coronavirus was starting to race through other nations. After a Chinese real-estate company in Sydney <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-doctors-issue-protective-equipment-warning-after-report-china-backed-firm-sourced-bulk-supplies-from-sydney\" title=\"\">was discovered</a> to have bought millions of masks, the Australian Medical Association urged its government to keep protective gear safe from foreign buyers. A lawyer attached to Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/04/05/trump-admin-weighs-legal-action-over-alleged-chinese-hoarding-of-ppe/\" title=\"\">compared</a> China\u2019s actions to \u201cfirst-degree murder\u201d and wondered aloud if the US could sue Beijing. The US state of Missouri then went on to do just that, arguing in its <a href=\"https://ago.mo.gov/docs/default-source/press-releases/2019/prc-complaint.pdf?sfvrsn=86ae7ab_2\" title=\"\">lawsuit</a> that China had \u201choarded personal protective equipment \u2013 thus causing a global pandemic that was unnecessary and preventable\u201d.</p> \n<p>But for the US and the rest of the west to complain about China aggressively pursuing its own interests is, in one way, to engage in a fundamental duplicity. China\u2019s wealth and power are the result of a longstanding international consensus championed by the US: that the quest for the lowest possible cost of production and the highest possible profit is paramount. According to this philosophy, if that means offshoring nearly everything to China, nothing must be allowed to stand in the way: not the hollowing-out of industry at home, or the loss of livelihoods, or human-rights concerns. And it isn\u2019t just China that has prospered from this arrangement. It has also been good to the richest people in the richest countries. Many of those same people now seem affronted by the world they helped create.</p> \n<p>As events transpired, few large nations behaved very differently from China once the disease blazed up within their own borders. \u201cA dog-eat-dog world is back,\u201d one former Polish diplomat <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/amid-coronavirus-a-dog-eat-dog-world-is-back/\" title=\"\">lamented</a>, as if such a world had ever gone anywhere in the first place.</p> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<p>By mid-March, China had relaxed its rules, allowing both masks and meltblown to be sold overseas again, to nations that were now in dire need of pandemic gear. But the market kept failing: supplies of masks often didn\u2019t make it to doctors, nurses, the elderly and others who required them most.</p> \n<p>During the great global scrum that followed, governments used every conceivable means to get hold of masks for their citizens before they went elsewhere. Foreign embassies in China turned their diplomatic staff <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/defence/coronavirus-mea-plays-proactive-role-in-fight-against-covid-19/1938679/\" title=\"\">into scouts</a> for medical supplies; Canada hired a multinational consulting firm to help <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-building-own-ppe-supply-chain-in-china-1.5530259\" title=\"\">figure out</a> which manufacturers could be trusted. Freight agents in China, who book space on ships and planes for goods leaving the country, found themselves handling medical equipment and little else. One agent in Shanghai, Fredrik Barner, had been shipping auto parts until this spring, when he was flooded with orders to move masks instead. \u201cI\u2019ve been in the industry for 10 years and I\u2019ve never seen such high air-freight rates,\u201d Barner told me. \u201cNormally, the rate is around $3 or $4 a kilogram. That went up to $17 or $18.\u201d</p> \n<p>Nations that couldn\u2019t make enough masks for themselves had to find unconventional ways to bring them in from China. In Ireland, the government asked Aer Lingus to run supplies out of Beijing. The airline had never flown to China before, and the planning and approvals for a new route would usually have taken six months. Aer Lingus did it in a week. Brian O\u2019Sullivan, Aer Lingus\u2019s chief flying instructor, captained the first plane to Beijing on 27 March, taking with him four other pilots, two engineers and a specialist in balancing loads in an airplane. Ten hours out, six hours on the ground, then 13 hours back: the kind of flight schedule that is, for a single crew, inconceivable in regular aviation.</p> \n<p>They landed in Beijing very early on a Sunday morning. Through the plane\u2019s open door, O\u2019Sullivan noticed that the airport, which usually buzzes like a beehive with flights landing and taking off, was practically in hibernation; in six hours, he saw just half a dozen or so departures. His crew never left the aircraft, O\u2019Sullivan told me, because that would have required them to go into quarantine. Instead, they stayed in business class, behind thick plastic drapes, while ground handlers loaded first the cargo hold and then economy class: huge green bags filled with masks, gowns and gloves were strapped into the seats, as if the cabin had been booked out by gigantic pods of peas. \u201cWe didn\u2019t shake hands with anyone,\u201d O\u2019Sullivan said, \u201cbut there were plenty of smiles and thankyous and nodding heads.\u201d When I spoke to him in mid-April, Aer Lingus had completed 30 Beijing flights, and expected to run another 200 or so by the end of May.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\" no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>To meet the rush for masks, a strange alternate ecosystem of suppliers sprang up, often supplying products of dubious quality. In Europe, several buyers of Chinese masks found their products to be sub-standard. The Dutch government had to recall 600,000 masks. Finland <a href=\"https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/04/09/finland-discovers-masks-bought-from-china-not-hospital-safe.html\" title=\"\">discovered</a> that an order of 2m surgical masks, which are discarded after use with a single patient, weren\u2019t good enough for hospital wear. Even if they had been up to scratch, those 2m masks would have only met the country\u2019s needs for four days.</p> \n<p>It wasn\u2019t always clear who was producing these masks. Being in the trade, Christopher Dobbing got a number of emails throughout March and April from Chinese mask vendors he\u2019d never heard of before. He sent me a few of them, and I rang one of the listed numbers, in the city of Zhangjiagang, 100 miles or so from Shanghai. A woman picked up and introduced herself as Rita. She told me that the company she worked for had been selling K95 masks since the first week of March, for $2.50 a pop. I asked if they manufactured the masks as well.</p> \n<p>She laughed. \u201cNo, we make tin plate. But our clients in America and Europe asked if we could source masks, so we do that now,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe get them from a big factory nearby, which makes masks.\u201d</p> \n<p>I asked how long it would take to send 10,000 masks to London. She couldn\u2019t say. There weren\u2019t many flights out of the country, and after some batches of exported masks had been found to be defective, Chinese customs authorities were inspecting mask cargoes more rigorously. A friend of hers, another mask vendor, had been waiting two weeks already for one of her shipments to clear customs, she told me.</p> \n<p>The factory that actually made the masks belonged to another company, Rita said. Chinese manufacturers that produce masks for medical use in the west must be certified by government health agencies such as the US Food and Drug Administration. Rita assured me that the manufacturer had an FDA certificate, and she emailed me a scan to prove it. It had been issued on 1 April. In the space where the manufacturer\u2019s name should have been displayed, there was just a short span of white space followed by the generic words Technology Co., Ltd. It looked like any company might print its name into the blank space and make the certificate its own. On the FDA\u2019s database, I looked up the certificate\u2019s number. The FDA had awarded it to Jiangsu Newborn Medical Technology Co, Ltd \u2013 a different company altogether.</p> \n<p>Among those tempted to reinvent themselves as mask merchants were drug dealers, who used the crisis to diversify their portfolio. Logan Pauley, a researcher at the Center for Advanced Defense Studies in Washington DC, tracks the sales of illicit drugs on the internet, focusing on trafficking from east Asia to the rest of the world. Towards the end of February, he noticed that some of the dealers he monitors were advertising masks and gloves. He sent me screenshots. \u201cMask, 3ply, 50pcs per box, 20 box min. $33.50 per box, exclude shipping charges,\u201d ran one Facebook post by a user named Vicky, in a group where people otherwise offer fentanyl for sale.</p> \n<p>It was difficult to know how to feel about these transactions, Pauley said. On the one hand, Vicky\u2019s masks might well be of terrible quality, and there was a danger that the masks would be deliberately mislabelled, whisked through US customs, and then sold on to US hospitals short of gear. \u201cCustoms is swamped right now,\u201d said Pauley. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to be opening and checking every box.\u201d On the other hand, he said, the FDA and other international authorities that license medical supplies \u201chave made it difficult, in this time of need, to get new suppliers approved in a timely fashion. If the masks are good, the hospital may be paying three times the price for them, but it\u2019s still better than waiting for FDA approvals.\u201d</p> \n<p>He was right. If I\u2019d been a hospital administrator in critical need of masks, perhaps I\u2019d have placed an order with one of these shadowy brokers. In the absence of government supplies or a well-ordered mask market, the seediest corners of the internet seemed to offer one of the few ways to find any masks at all.</p> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<p>Alongside the new mask middlemen and the criminal elements finding a fresh vocation, there were the groups who had never fabricated a mask before, but who had a sure sense of money to be made. From February onwards, legions of new mask-makers emerged, of every size and shape: from big companies such as BMW to the amateurs the meltblown executive characterised as \u201cfour neighbours in a cul-de-sac in Los Angeles, who\u2019ve gone on to the internet to learn about sewing masks\u201d. A face mask-making machine costs about $100,000, he told me, and it makes about 70,000-100,000 masks a day. He has received at least 200 enquiries from Americans who are importing machines from China \u2013 \u201cpeople who just have 100K to spend and a bit of space, and want to make some money.\u201d</p> \n<p>You\u2019d like to think they have some experience doing this, he said, but many of them don\u2019t know a thing. They ring him when they\u2019re expecting a new machine in three weeks, to ask vaguely for mask textile.</p> \n<p>\u201cDo you want meltblown?\u201d he asks them.</p> \n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> \n<p>What about noseclips? What about spun-bound polypropylene, the plastic that encases the melt-blown?</p> \n<p>\u201cOh, we need to get some of that, too, do we?\u201d</p> \n<p>And then, the executive said to me with a sigh: \u201cI have to spend half an hour teaching them about mask manufacturing.\u201d</p> \n<p>All these breakdowns in the market \u2013 the hospitals without masks, the bogus gear, the exorbitant prices, the hoarding, the fly-by-night profiteers \u2013 seem to expose the limits of orthodox economics. The most ardent devotees of the free market believe that supply and demand solve every basic problem if they\u2019re permitted to work unconstrained. When demand is high, the price climbs, and the prospect of profit brings in a host of new suppliers. With time, the market rewards those who sell good products and punishes those who sell poor ones; with time, the price settles so that it allocates products most efficiently to those who value them most.</p> \n<p>That\u2019s the theory, anyway, and its advocates insist that it applies even in a crisis. In 2012, for instance, researchers at the University of Chicago asked eminent economists for their opinions on Connecticut\u2019s plan to outlaw price-gouging \u2013 exploitatively high prices \u2013 during floods or other weather cataclysms. Seventy-seven <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JwfFDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA82&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=connecticut+2012+price+gouging+weather&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DpDYaMSZDs&amp;sig=ACfU3U1edKBXJpI4IT5ntHyRR69cgTO2eQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjVkrK1rfnoAhWyunEKHXzbDm0Q6AEwB3oECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=connecticut%202012%20price%20gouging%20weather&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">percent</a> of the economists thought that governments shouldn\u2019t curb or interfere with prices \u2013 that, all things considered, the best way to get vital goods to those who needed them was to put no reins on the market at all.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e2b9a315c5d597cb77a8da5dda99dd13199ac2c4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2b9a315c5d597cb77a8da5dda99dd13199ac2c4/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vendors selling masks at the roadside in Los Angeles this week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vendors selling masks at the roadside in Los Angeles this week.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Vogel/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But this pandemic has provided a huge weight of evidence to the contrary: tales <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/coronavirus-indonesia-seizes-half-a-million-masks-amid-panic-buying\" title=\"\">of</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/nyregion/brooklyn-coronavirus-price-gouging.html\" title=\"\">hoarders</a>, of doctors and nurses so short of protective gear that some wore <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nurse-at-brooklyn-hospital-on-coronavirus-protective-clothing-its-a-garbage-bag-its-like-something-out-of-the-twlight-zone-2020-04-07\" title=\"\">bin bags</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/01/nhs-staff-making-masks-from-snorkels-amid-ppe-shortages\" title=\"\">snorkels</a>, and of deals so desperate that a <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/the-trump-administration-paid-a-bankrupt-company-with-zero-employees-2455-million-for-n95-masks-which-its-never-manufactured/ar-BB12JwUk\" title=\"\">security training company</a>, bankrupt for months and with no employees, somehow won a $55m contract to supply masks. These failures happen, in part, because ordinarily the market\u2019s idea of efficiency involves getting products to those willing to pay the most for them. In a crisis, or even outside of one, that isn\u2019t the same as getting products to the maximum possible number of people who need them.</p> \n<p>\u201cI have always thought that economists were obsessed with efficiency, no matter what happened to distribution,\u201d Angus Deaton, the Nobel-winning economist, told me. But distribution is what matters, particularly in an emergency. During this pandemic, the best scenario for everyone would be to get masks to doctors and nurses first \u2013 \u201cwe want to keep them well, so that they can save our lives and the lives of others,\u201d said Nicholas Bloom, a Stanford economist who studies periods of panic and uncertainty. But high prices in unregulated markets keeps masks out of reach for the hospitals that need them. By the time the market culls bad suppliers, stabilises the price and compels hoarders to sell, the disease has spread and people have died.</p> \n<p>Solving this, Bloom said, requires a hand on the tiller: steering the market in ways that classical economists tend to dislike. One strategy is to cap prices so that they don\u2019t become exorbitant but still offer the kind of profits that draw new manufacturers in. Bloom also thinks governments should requisition masks for their health services first, before allowing the rest into the market. \u201cIt\u2019s no different from how food was rationed during the world wars. Or how Britain bought tanks from Vickers during the second world war. It didn\u2019t have to take over the firm. It just offered a fair price. This is the same,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is like an economy in wartime.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<p>For anyone who views the prevailing international order as a brutish contest for resources, disguised occasionally by noble words and fine treaties, the scramble for masks offers a perfect little parable. It has taken on the appearance of a zero-sum struggle straight out of a game-theory seminar: with limited supply and endless demand, one mask for you is one mask less for me. To this austere truth, nations have reacted in familiar ways; amid the novel chaos created by Covid-19, old enmities and hardened habits reassert themselves.</p> \n<p>So when, in early April, news anchors in Pakistan <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ani/covid-19-china-buffoons-all-weather-ally-pakistan-by-sending-underwear-masks-120040500163_1.html\" title=\"\">complained</a> that China had sent their country masks made out of underwear, Indian nationalists on Twitter launched a mocking <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/underwear_mask_for_pakistan\" title=\"\">hashtag</a>. A couple of weeks before that, when British tabloids reported on French border guards impounding two trucks of masks earmarked for the NHS, it confirmed the worst suspicions of every Eurosceptic. \u201cThis shows you all you need to know about European cooperation,\u201d Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader and ardent Brexiter, told the Sun. When the EU did<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/uk-missed-three-chances-to-join-eu-scheme-to-bulk-buy-ppe\" title=\"\"> invite Britain to take part</a> in a bulk purchase of protective apparel and ventilators, though, the government passed. The reason appears to be either the stubbornness of its Brexit spirit or its ineptitude in checking its email; both seem equally possible under Boris Johnson\u2019s government.</p> \n<p>The US, for its part, treated the procurement of masks as a smash-and-grab operation. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/global-battle-coronavirus-equipment-masks-tests\" title=\"\">April</a>, an incredible account emerged of Americans brandishing cash on the runway of a Shanghai airport, buying up a cargo of masks that was already on a plane, ready to fly out to France. No one quite clarified who these Americans were, or how they barged onto the runway, but the episode enraged French officials. In its wake, Renaud Muselier, the president of the regional council of Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, chose to bring his masks home by sea. \u201cAt least that way, I can be sure nobody will steal my masks from the tarmac,\u201d he told a French TV station.</p> \n<p>The US was also accused of waylaying masks in Bangkok before they flew on to Germany, and of blocking the delivery of 3m American-made masks to Canada. Last month, Ovidiu Olea, the Hong Kong entrepreneur, purchased 50,000 sets of masks, gloves and coveralls, which he planned to donate to the health service in his native Romania. \u201cEverything else was ready, and then my coveralls supplier called to say that some Americans showed up, paid three times the price, and bought my order out from under my nose,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6a6386814815c1bf68619fe7240279974679b378\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a6386814815c1bf68619fe7240279974679b378/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Germany\u2019s defence minister welcoming a shipment of 10 million masks and other protective items from China in Leipzig this week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Germany\u2019s defence minister welcoming a shipment of 10 million masks and other protective items from China in Leipzig this week.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jens Schlueter/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the EU, relations between member nations have prickled with tension over the lack of masks and other gear. By the end of February, there were more than 1,000 coronavirus cases across Italy, and it needed more protective gear \u2013 masks in particular. Around that time, a legislator in Italy\u2019s coalition government told me, France and Germany implemented national laws that declared masks as strategic assets, which meant that if masks were transiting through these countries, bound for elsewhere, they could be appropriated. For a while, she said, France and Germany kept hold of some masks that Italy had ordered from India, Turkey and Vietnam.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn those darkest moments, China stepped in and offered 200,000 masks as a present,\u201d the legislator said. A plane landed in Rome, carrying masks and gear but also traditional Chinese herbs: an exercise in what has come to be known as \u201cmask diplomacy\u201d. Not long afterwards, France and Germany lifted their mask seizure laws and sent free masks to Italy. But by that point, the legislator said, \u201cthe damage had been done\u201d.</p> \n<p>Since then, Italy has bought more than 20m masks from China, but China has been expert at projecting these sales as an extension of its benevolence. The Chinese government now buys full newspaper pages for advertorials that laud its assistance to Italy. After we spoke, the legislator texted me an opinion poll by an Italian thinktank, in which 52% of respondents named China as Italy\u2019s best friend. \u201cLook at the list of enemies,\u201d she wrote. On top: Germany at 45% and then France at 38%.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s alarming,\u201d she said, \u201chow the public isn\u2019t seeing that European institutions are actually doing a lot for Italy.\u201d Germany reserved dozens of intensive-care beds for Italians, flew them in for treatment and delivered ventilators to Italian hospitals; France sent hundreds of thousands of protective suits. But China\u2019s mask diplomacy has fanned a mistrust of the EU kindled years ago by Italy\u2019s populists. The legislator sounded despondent. \u201cI wish I could say this mask diplomacy isn\u2019t working very well. But it is, unfortunately.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<p>Whatever the new normal is after this pandemic, everyone I spoke with agreed on one thing: there will be masks. Lots and lots of masks. They\u2019ll be handed out on airlines and at hotels; they\u2019ll be stacked next to the till at Boots; they\u2019ll be stashed in sock drawers and linen closets in practically every home. Every country will produce and stockpile its own supply, unwilling to rely any more on the vagaries of the international market; Germany, forever ahead of the curve, has already <a href=\"https://www.thelocal.de/20200408/highly-likely-that-face-mark-requirement-will-come-to-germany-says-bavarian-president\" title=\"\">begun</a>.</p> \n<p>We already guessed, before the pandemic, that one version of our future would entail masks for billions of us. It\u2019s the version in which we keep burning carbon, polluting our air and aggravating global warming so much that our land keeps going up in flames. But that still felt distant enough to be somewhat avoidable. We could hope that, however slowly or inexpertly, countries would pool their energies to stop this. Now, though, the age of masks has arrived sooner than we anticipated, brought on by an entirely different threat altogether. And the manner of its arrival carries a warning: that with the world as it is, the solidarity needed to battle climate change may be impossible to secure, and that the future of smoky skies and rising seas is the only one that lies ahead of us.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/how-coronavirus-almost-brought-down-the-global-financial-system\">How coronavirus almost brought down the global financial system | Adam Tooze</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Ovidiu Olea\u2019s mask machine arrived from China on the third Monday of April.

An additional 5.1 million people in 96 countries had been displaced by disasters.</p> <p>Alexandra Bilak, the IDMC director, said she had hoped internal displacement would receive more global attention this year, following the launch in October of a <a href=\"https://disasterdisplacement.org/press-release-by-co-chairs-of-the-un-secretary-generals-high-level-panel-on-internal-displacement-on-commencement-of-work\">UN high-level panel</a> to address the problem and find long-term solutions. The panel held its first meeting in February.</p> <p>However, Covid-19 was expected to shift focus away, she said. \u201cWe were so hoping this year would be really the wake-up call to the international community, with the new high-level panel on internal displacement. We thought this year would be the year of internal displacement,\u201d said Bilak.</p> <p>She said it was too early to assess the full impact of the coronavirus on displacement and the efforts to address it, but was worried about future funding.</p> <p>\u201cIf we\u2019re about to plunge into a recession, of course it\u2019s going to have an impact on the generosity of donor governments,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a really bad situation for everybody.\u201d</p> <p>Bilak added there was great concern for the safety of people who have been displaced. \u201cIDPs (internally displaced people) are often highly vulnerable people living in crowded camps, emergency shelters and informal settlements with little or no access to healthcare. The global coronavirus pandemic will make them more vulnerable still. It will compromise their already precarious living conditions, by further limiting their access to essential services and humanitarian aid.\u201d</p> <p>Bilak said the Norwegian Refugee Council and other humanitarian agencies were already reporting that government restrictions were affecting the delivery of aid.</p> <p>The report, published on Tuesday, showed that the majority of new cases of displacement last year were in poorer countries.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/may/10/global-neglect-of-millions-forced-from-their-homes-by-conflict-branded-pitiful\">Global neglect of millions forced from their homes by conflict branded 'pitiful'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The highest number were recorded in sub-Saharan Africa, where escalating violence and deteriorating security in the Sahel and ongoing conflict in Somalia and South Sudan continued to drive hundreds of thousands from their homes.</p> <p>Tropical storms and monsoon rains in south and east Asia and the Pacific had also displaced millions. India, the Philippines, Bangladesh and China each recorded at least 4 million displacements, although the majority were the result of evacuations by their governments.</p> <p>By the end of last year, more than 130,000 people were still unable to return home after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/23/families-stranded-without-aid-in-wake-of-mozambique-cyclone\">devastation of cyclones Idai</a> and Kenneth.</p> <p>Bilak warned that next year\u2019s displacement report was \u201cgoing to be extremely difficult\u201d to compile as people responsible for collecting data may struggle to do so under current restrictions. \u201cWe could end up with a black hole of data,\u201d she said.</p>",
  "<p>For three weeks, Jack* lived in a bubble. He was oblivious to the ban on gatherings, the state of emergency declarations, the run on toilet paper. His phone was confiscated, and the television news never switched on.</p> <p>Jack was in the middle of his own crisis. He had checked into the South Pacific Private treatment centre in Sydney because his life was \u201cspiralling out of control\u201d. He was just 20, and for two years had been addicted to illicit drugs, especially crystal methamphetamine, known as ice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian Australia coronavirus email signup button\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a></strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>His parents, John* and Marie*, had done everything they could to help him get off drugs, including moving from Melbourne to Lakes Entrance in Victoria\u2019s East Gippsland six months before. \u201cAs an addict, you find it. And I found it the first night I moved down here. It just finally clicked for me that I just couldn\u2019t live like this any more.\u201d</p> <p>John says that for two years, every decision the family made revolved around how to help Jack get off drugs. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through hell,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"454b2fdcb5caefb0a5b9056c91ff734887e27cd3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/454b2fdcb5caefb0a5b9056c91ff734887e27cd3/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The South Pacific Private rehabilitation centre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Days at the South Pacific Private rehabilitation centre follow a strict routine that begins at 6.30am. Inpatients have no access to news and only telephone contact with loved ones.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carly Earl/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In early March, Jack was an inpatient at South Pacific in Curl Curl, a Sydney beachside suburb. Each day was structured: up at 6.30am to walk along the beach, breakfast at 7.30am, group therapy for two and a half hours, intense sessions about trauma, anxiety and depression; \u201cwhat caused you to use, essentially\u201d. There were lessons about basic life skills, setting boundaries, the process of change.</p> <p>Jack was cut off from the outside world. He had just one visitor during his time at South Pacific. There were occasional 10-minute phone calls and no news. The idea was that Jack and other patients focused on their recovery with no distractions.</p> <p>When Jack emerged, he went straight to Beachwood Recovery House next door, where he planned to stay for 10 weeks. A person with serious drug misuse problems can be weaned off the physical addiction fairly quickly, but often needs weeks of gradual transition to normal life. Controls were loosened slowly. Phones were returned, Sundays were free time, and the television set was on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cc7d57265346ba43ebe7edbdb6ad7f68d6c0cd63\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc7d57265346ba43ebe7edbdb6ad7f68d6c0cd63/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beachwood Recovery House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">After leaving the rehabilitation centre, Jack spent only a week at Beachwood Recovery House before it was closed due to physical distancing measures.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carly Earl/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI walked straight in and on the news was this big headline saying coronavirus, the borders are gonna shut. I was like, \u2018oh my God\u2019.\u201d Physical distancing measures had already been introduced at Beachwood, reducing numbers in therapy sessions. He spent a week there until its day programs shut down due to coronavirus fears and he was asked to leave.</p> <p>\u201cI was really upset because I didn\u2019t really want to come back to Lakes Entrance because this is where a lot of my shit happened,\u201d says Jack. The closure was abrupt. Jack\u2019s mother, Marie, drove nearly eight hours from Lakes Entrance to Sydney and picked him up on 23 March.</p> <p>\u201cShe was crying, for starters, because I hadn\u2019t seen her in a month,\u201d he says. \u201cShe said she just wanted to bring me home in isolation while this virus dies over. But she noticed a massive change in me \u2013 in the way I spoke and acted \u2013 so she was really happy.\u201d</p> <p>The pandemic hasn\u2019t caused people\u2019s existing challenges to disappear. It has just added another layer of complexity for people with drug and alcohol problems. Jack is fortunate. The demand for treatment in Australia far exceeds supply, a commission investigating the rise of ice addition in New South Wales <a href=\"https://www.dpc.nsw.gov.au/assets/dpc-nsw-gov-au/publications/The-Drug-ice-1546/02-Report-Volume-1a.pdf\">found this year</a>. His parents\u2019 health insurance covered most of the $21,000 cost of rehab, although they had borrowed money to pay for the transition program.</p> <p>Isolation can also exacerbate stress and anxiety. A YouGov Galaxy survey commissioned by the Foundation for Alcohol Research and Education <a href=\"https://fare.org.au/many-australians-using-more-alcohol-and-worried-about-household-drinking/\">found that 70% of Australians were drinking more alcohol</a> now than usual.</p> <p>So far, Jack is doing well at home. He\u2019s a tall, gentle-faced young man, his charm and self-deprecating humour masking two years of chaos. \u201cI\u2019m 75 days clean and sober,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a95f840515e4c64a64053797eddb9b4e7bd92f3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a95f840515e4c64a64053797eddb9b4e7bd92f3e/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pamphlets at the The South Pacific Private rehabilitation centre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Although Beachwood Recovery Centre has closed, the South Pacific rehabilitation facility remains open, with a 48-hour quarantine for new patients.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carly Earl/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Coronavirus has meant his Narcotics Anonymous meetings are now online, a trend experts say is likely to continue post lockdown. He\u2019s a social creature, and he misses going to Melbourne to visit his friends. He\u2019s filling his time bushwalking, mountain bike riding, \u201ctrying to stay sane \u2026 and annoying the shit out of my parents, who are amazing\u201d.</p> <p>When all this is over, he\u2019d like to go back to Sydney to complete the transition program. The South Pacific rehab centre remains open, with a 48-hour quarantine for new patients, and sessions held in large rooms to enable social distancing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/on-top-of-everything-coronavirus-is-making-australias-drug-crisis-a-whole-lot-worse\">'On top of everything': coronavirus is making Australia's drug crisis a whole lot worse</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Isolating in the pretty holiday town of Lakes Entrance might help Jack and it might not. He has deleted the contacts of former friends who were users from his phone, and the temptations of late-night clubbing are gone.
