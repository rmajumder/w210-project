  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Global known death toll passes 335,000</h2> <p>According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 5,180,982 people have become infected, while at least 336,404 have died around the world. The figures, which are based on official releases and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the true scale of the pandemic.</p> <h2>South America is now pandemic\u2019s centre \u2013 WHO</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/22/coronavirus-live-news-trump-pushes-to-open-churches-as-brazil-death-toll-passes-20000-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ec8173a8f0864e579f16205#block-5ec8173a8f0864e579f16205\">South America has become a new centre of the pandemic</a>, with Brazil hardest-hit, while cases are rising in some African countries that so far have a relatively low death toll, the World Health Organization says.</p> <p>\u201cIn a sense, South America has become a new epicentre for the disease,\u201d Dr Mike Ryan, WHO\u2019s top emergencies expert, says. He adds that Brazil is \u201cclearly the most affected\u201d.</p> <h2>Police spoke to Downing Street adviser after trip during lockdown</h2> <p>In the UK, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/22/coronavirus-live-news-trump-pushes-to-open-churches-as-brazil-death-toll-passes-20000-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ec822258f0886ce4f5d8cdb#block-5ec822258f0886ce4f5d8cdb\">police have spoken to the prime minister\u2019s key adviser Dominic Cummings</a> about breaching the government\u2019s lockdown rules after he was seen in Durham, 264 miles from his London home, despite having had symptoms of coronavirus.</p> <p>Officers approached him days after he was seen rushing out of Downing Street when the prime minister tested positive for the virus at the end of March, a joint investigation by the Guardian and the Mirror finds.</p> <h2>Peru extends state of emergency</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/22/coronavirus-live-news-trump-pushes-to-open-churches-as-brazil-death-toll-passes-20000-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ec8379f8f0864e579f162f0#block-5ec8379f8f0864e579f162f0\">Peru extends its state of emergency until the end of June</a> with only a very partial lifting of its lockdown as infections continue to climb despite more than two months of confinement.</p> <p>Peru is the second-worst affected Latin American country, with more than 111,000 cases and a death toll of 3,148, according to official figures.</p> <h2>Iceland to lower national emergency rating</h2> <p>Iceland is set to lower its national emergency rating on Monday, as authorities say there are just two people left in isolation waiting to recover from their infections. Iceland has <a href=\"https://www.covid.is/data\">recorded 1,803 confirmed cases</a>; 10 people have died and 1,791 have recovered.</p> <h2>80 million infants may have missed out on routine vaccines</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/22/coronavirus-live-news-trump-pushes-to-open-churches-as-brazil-death-toll-passes-20000-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ec7f5d48f0864e579f16036#block-5ec7f5d48f0864e579f16036\">About 80 million infants may have missed out on vaccines</a> for diseases including diphtheria, measles and polio as a result of the disruption to healthcare services caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the World Health Organization says.</p> <p>According to data collected by the WHO and its partners, the provision of routine immunisations for children under the age of one has been hindered in at least 68 countries, causing disruption to vaccine programmes not seen since their inception in the 1970s.</p> <h2>660,000 forced to flee homes since UN\u2019s ceasefire call</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/22/coronavirus-live-news-trump-pushes-to-open-churches-as-brazil-death-toll-passes-20000-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ec7b6598f0886ce4f5d86f4#block-5ec7b6598f0886ce4f5d86f4\">Fighting has forced 660,000 people to flee their homes</a> since the UN secretary general called for a global ceasefire to focus on handling the pandemic, an NGO says.</p> <p>Ant\u00f3nio Guterres reiterated his call for an end to conflict this week. But the Norwegian Refugee Council says that the UN security council has failed to provide leadership for ceasefires, peace talks or protection of civilians during the pandemic.</p> <h2>UK orders quarantines for new arrivals</h2> <p>Two-week quarantines <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/22/uk-arrivals-8-june-quarantine-for-14-days-coronavirus\">will be imposed on new arrivals to the UK from 8 June</a>, with a \u00a31,000 fine awaiting anyone who breaches the measure.

  "<p>I am very tired of Joe Biden. My vote for him was already hanging by a thread before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/22/joe-biden-draws-criticism-americans-who-back-trump-aint-black\">his disastrous interview with Charlamagne tha God</a> on Friday. Interrupting the Breakfast Club host\u2019s explanation that black people needed assurances that our communities will benefit from his presidency, Biden asserted: \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a problem figuring out whether you\u2019re for me or for Trump, then you ain\u2019t black.\u201d</p> \n<p>Again, I am very tired of Joe Biden. Not because I am a purist, or have inflexible ideological commitments of what it will take to remove Donald Trump from office. But rather because Biden\u2019s condescension towards black communities is intolerable.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/15/biden-progressives-push-left\">The fight is on for progressives to push Biden to the left. They might just win | Cas Mudde</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>I want to believe that Biden\u2019s condescension started after the respected Representative <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/04/joe-biden-jim-clyburn-endorsement-super-tuesday\">James Clyburn</a> called the former vice-president an \u201chonorary black man\u201d at a private dinner in March. But his mistreatment of black people, verbally and politically, is decades old, and is a reflection of the Democratic party in general.</p> \n<p>Throughout Biden\u2019s career, he has boasted about his ability to bridge partisan divides by sacrificing the needs of black people and poor people in the name of \u201ccompromise\u201d. For the last 30 years, Biden has repeatedly talked about freezing, cutting, or raising the age for social security and other benefits \u2013 as much as $2tn one time. <a href=\"http://inthesetimes.com/article/21856/joe-biden-cut-medicare-social-security-retirement-age\">His response</a> to concerns that these cuts would hurt the poor? \u201cWe\u2019re going to do lots of hard things \u2026 we might as well do this.\u201d</p> \n<p>Social security is an important program for black people, especially as we age. Among <a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/news/press/factsheets/africanamer-alt.pdf\">African Americans receiving </a><a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/news/press/factsheets/africanamer-alt.pdf\">social </a><a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/news/press/factsheets/africanamer-alt.pdf\">security</a>, 35% of elderly married couples and 58% of unmarried elderly persons relied on it for 90% or more of their income. The reliance is not due to laziness or spending habits \u2013 people of color and white people make <a href=\"https://crr.bc.edu/briefs/401k-plans-and-race/\">similar choices and contributions to retirement</a> \u2013 but due to racism, lack of workplace retirement plans and barriers to accessing high-paying jobs.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey know where my heart is,\u201d Biden <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/us/politics/joe-biden-iowa-black-voters.html\">has said</a>, of black voters.</p> \n<p>But do we?</p> \n<p>Senator Kamala Harris was <a href=\"https://amp.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/03/black-woman-president-kamala-harris\">severely scrutinized</a> for her treatment of poor black women as a prosecutor \u2013 yet Biden\u2019s criminal justice record makes Harris look like Thurgood Marshall. Biden authored and successfully passed the $30bn 1994 <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/20/18677998/joe-biden-1994-crime-bill-law-mass-incarceration\">Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act</a>. Besides putting 100,000 additional police officers in the streets, the crime bill distributed funding for new prison construction, encouraged prosecutors to charge children as adults, and even added the death penalty for 28 new areas, including <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-69-federal-death-penalty-act-1994\">drug-related offenses</a>. Pushing for further criminalization, then senator Biden argued that George HW Bush\u2019s crime plan <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?8997-1/democratic-response-drug-policy-address\">did not go far enough</a> because it did not \u201cinclude enough police officers to catch the violent thugs, not enough prosecutors to convict them, not enough judges to sentence them, and not enough prison cells to put them away for a long time\u201d. An older black generation fought through Jim Crow only for Biden to help make sure that their children and grandchildren lived through a new Jim Crow.</p> \n<p>On the House floor, Biden compared his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/us/joe-biden-crime-laws.html\">criminal justice approach</a> to Richard Nixon\u2019s law and order stance: \u201cI would say, \u2018Lock the SOBs up.\u2019\u201d Black people were arrested in droves following this bill, despite comparable drug use rates to white people; many are still sitting in prison today. Biden has since acknowledged flaws in the bill, but last summer he reiterated his support for the bill. The law spent $30bn but contributed to only <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/26/opinion/the-police-cant-solve-the-problem-they-are-the-problem.html\">a 1.3% decline in violent crime</a>. He has yet to call for it to be repealed.</p> \n<p>Today, some cities plan to expunge marijuana records and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/12/02/evanston-illinois-reparations-plan-african-americans-is-marijuana-tax/\">hope to pay reparations</a> to black people formerly incarcerated for marijuana offenses. But Biden can\u2019t seem to let go; <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/06/joe-biden-legalize-marijuana-111642\">he is inconsistent and ambivalent about marijuana legalization</a>. He has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/18/politics/joe-biden-marijuana-gateway-drug/index.html\">argued</a> it may be a gateway drug, a statement he has since <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomangell/2020/03/06/joe-biden-is-frustrated-people-think-he-still-believes-marijuana-is-a-gateway-drug/#5a5184749aa2\">dialed back</a>.<strong> </strong>Of course, keeping marijuana illegal at the federal level does not mean that people will not use it, but rather that the extra police that he put on the street will send people of color to jail for using it. Ironically, the police were probably nowhere to be found when Biden\u2019s friends <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/20/politics/in-secretly-taped-conversations-glimpses-of-the-future-president.html\">George W Bush</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/\">Barack Obama</a> used marijuana. If anything, the drug seems to be a gateway to the White House.</p> \n<p>Despite attempting to cut social programs and increasing mass incarceration, Biden claims to care about black families. But he doesn\u2019t seem to know many. During the September 2019 Democratic debate he claimed that poor families should put on a <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/video/sports/joe-biden-parents-should-make-sure-you-have-the-record-player-on-at-night-to-expand-childrens-vocabulary/vi-AAHfDMH\">record player</a> so their children will know more words. Recently, during an interview with the New York Times editorial board, he argued that poor black parents feel ashamed <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/17/opinion/joe-biden-nytimes-interview.html\">because they cannot read and skip parent-teacher conferences</a>. He was hoping to encourage them to be better parents. But his assertion is incorrect. Black and white parents have comparable participation rates overall and attend parent-teacher conferences at the <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2017/2017102.pdf\">exact same rates</a>. In fact, black parents and poor parents are the most likely to check their children\u2019s homework and <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2017/2017102.pdf\">meet with</a> guidance counselors. Biden instead relied on stereotypes that black people are not involved in their children\u2019s lives.</p> \n<p>Harris forced Biden to confront his work with racist elected officials to stop integration efforts using school busing. That was not his only education mistake. Biden played a significant role in creating the student debt crisis, including making student loan discharge \u201c<a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/01/07/joe-biden-student-loans/\">nearly impossible</a>\u201d. This is devastating to black people, who disproportionately carry school debt. While the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/06/why-women-hold-the-majority-of-student-loans.html\">average school debt</a> for black women with a bachelor\u2019s degree is about $25,000, that level of education does not provide the same level of financial security for black women as it does other groups, including white people with less education (primarily because of sexism and racism).</p> \n<p>Again and again, Biden\u2019s relationship with black Americans, like the Democratic National Committee\u2019s relationship, has been patronizing at best and actively harmful at worst.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Biden\u2019s friendship with one black person does not mean that he\u2019s a friend to black people</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Some black people will support Biden because of his association with Barack Obama \u2013 even though <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/obama-to-biden-dont-run\">Obama himself doesn\u2019t seem especially excited about Biden</a> becoming president. The Obama days feel distant yet warm compared to Donald Trump\u2019s current presidency. But remember: Biden cycled millions of black people in and out of jail, voted for massive numbers of poor people to go to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/12/us/politics/joe-biden-iraq-war.html\">war in Iraq</a>, threw Anita Hill under the bus <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/us/politics/joe-biden-anita-hill.html\">to confirm a conservative justice</a> to the US supreme court, and, under Obama\u2019s administration, helped to deport <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2019/11/joe-biden-deportations-immigration-barack-obama\">millions of immigrants</a> and <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2018/08/joe-biden-democratic-party-military-hawk\">bombed brown countries</a>. When Biden was vice-president, black <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2017/12/obama-foreclosure-crisis-wealth-inequality\">home ownership and wealth</a> declined significantly, even as it <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2019/02/28/feature/the-heartbreaking-decrease-in-black-homeownership/\">rose</a> for other races. Biden\u2019s friendship with one black person does not mean that he\u2019s a friend to black people.</p> \n<p>The Democratic party holds black people in an abusive relationship but says you cannot leave because the other option is more abusive. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t believe that a vote against Biden solely means a vote for Trump. Perhaps it is a vote against being captured by the party that makes empty promises every four years when it is election time, and delivers nothing. Perhaps it is a vote against the crime bill, drones and deportations. Perhaps it is a vote against covert and overt racism.</p> \n<p>Biden and others will rightfully argue that Trump is worse, and I agree. But what can Biden actually deliver? Will there be fewer drones if he\u2019s president? Maybe not. Fewer deportations? Maybe not. Less money to police departments? No. Will fewer black people die from police? Unlikely. Will black people have healthcare? Unlikely. Will black wealth increase? Unlikely. Will Palestinian lives be safer? Unlikely. Commitments to preserving our climate? Doubtful. If black people have a hard time figuring out the differences between Trump and Biden, then that is Biden\u2019s problem, not ours.</p> \n<p>Joe Biden refuses to reckon with the harm that he has caused to people all over the world. His best line is that he is better than the other guy, and that is exactly how abusive relationships function. Black people \u2013 all people \u2013 deserve better than Biden and the Democratic party. And yes, we are still black.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Derecka Purnell is a social movement lawyer and writer based in Washington, DC.

  "<p>India has reported more than 6,000 new Covid-19 cases, its biggest one-day increase, while China<strong> </strong>has abandoned setting a GDP growth target because of the \u201cgreat uncertainty\u201d caused by the pandemic.</p> <p>The sharp increase in new infections in <strong>India</strong> came after the government began easing lockdown restrictions and as airlines prepared to reopen selected domestic routes.</p> <p>\u201cThis surge has happened after movement of people was partially allowed,\u201d said Giridhar Babu, an epidemiologist at India\u2019s public health foundation. \u201cBut if you see overall, this is a much lower trajectory as compared to the rest of the world.\u201d</p> <p>Babu said India \u201cseems to have the capacity\u201d to contain the coronavirus, after authorities reported a total of more than 118,000 cases \u2013 up 5% from Thursday\u2019s figure - including 3,583 deaths.</p> <p>India\u2019s lockdown has been extended to 31 May but the rules have been relaxed in regions less severely affected by the pandemic. Roughly 30% of domestic flights are due to resume from Monday.</p> <p>Infections have surged in <strong>Indonesia</strong>,<strong> </strong>the world\u2019s fourth most populous nation, ahead of celebrations this weekend to mark the end of Ramadan, raising questions about the government\u2019s commitment to curbing the pandemic.</p> <p>The country reported 973 new cases, its highest one-day count, bringing its official total to more than 21,000 \u2013 although the real figure is thought to be much higher. Officials have said the public are not taking proper precautions, but only four of 34 provinces and 26 cities have imposed wide-scale restrictions.</p> <p>The rates of new infections have begun to dip in much of the world, but the disease is continuing its deadly march in <strong>Latin</strong> <strong>America</strong>, which was described by the World Health Organization on Friday as \u201ca new epicentre\u201d of the pandemic.</p> <p><strong>Russia</strong> reported 150 new deaths, a record daily number that took the country\u2019s official death toll from Covid-19 to 3,249. Authorities reported 8,894 new coronavirus cases, bringing the total to 326,448.</p> <p><strong>China</strong>\u2019s 3,000-member National People\u2019s Congress opened in Beijing on Friday with a minute\u2019s silence for coronavirus victims. The gathering was delayed by two months and has been shortened to a week because of the pandemic.</p> <p>In an apparent acknowledgement of the steep challenges China faces from a stricken economy and increasing international hostility, the premier, Li Keqiang, said \u201cno specific target\u201d would be set for growth this year, for the first time since the country began publishing GDP goals in 1990.</p> <p>\u201cThis is because our country will face some factors that are difficult to predict in its development due to the great uncertainty regarding the Covid-19 pandemic and the world economic and trade environment,\u201d Li said, adding that the government would instead \u201cgive priority to stabilising employment and ensuring living standards\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Singapore</strong> said its case total now exceeded 30,000, with 612 new infections, almost entirely in cramped dormitories for the city state\u2019s low-paid migrant workers.</p> <p><strong>Thailand</strong> said it would maintain its state of emergency until the end of June. Shopping centres and department stores in the kingdom opened at the weekend for the first time in almost two months as the rate of infection slowed, but bars, nightclubs, cinemas, playgrounds and some sports remain off-limits.</p> <p>The WHO said <strong>Africa</strong> was approaching 100,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases.</p> <p>The UN said the virus was assumed to be spreading throughout <strong>Yemen</strong>. Appealing for urgent funding, Jens Laerke, a spokesman for the UN office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs, said Yemen\u2019s healthcare system \u201chas in effect collapsed\u201d.</p> <p>He said aid workers were turning people away because of a lack of medical oxygen or sufficient supplies of personal protective equipment in the war-ravaged country. Yemen\u2019s malnourished population has among the world\u2019s lowest immunity levels.</p> <p>Months before a general election in <strong>New Zealand</strong>, the leader of the main opposition party was ousted after a poll showed an 84% approval rating for the way the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has handled the pandemic.</p> <p>In the <strong>US</strong>, pictures emerged of Donald Trump wearing a face mask during a factory visit in Michigan. The president had earlier been called a \u201cpetulant child\u201d by a state attorney general for allegedly refusing to wear a mask during a tour of the plant.</p> <p>The <strong>Czech Republic</strong> said the virus remained under control nearly two weeks after shopping centres, cinemas and restaurant terraces were reopened. \u201cThe massive easing of 11 May did not affect the epidemiological curve,\u201d said the health minister, Adam Vojtech.</p> <p>In <strong>Spain</strong>, the government said the Madrid region and the Barcelona metropolitan area \u2013 the two areas hardest hit by Covid-19 \u2013 would be able to move into the next phase of lockdown de-escalation from Monday.</p> <p>The loosening means all of Spain will now be in at least the second phase of the exit plan: people can meet in groups of up to 10, and restaurant and cafe terraces can reopen at 50% capacity. Places of worship will be able to operate at 30% capacity.</p> <p>The health minister, Salvador Illa, said 47% of the country would move to the third and penultimate stage on Monday, meaning people can visit shopping centres and eat inside restaurants, both of which will operate at 40% capacity.</p>",

But, he said: \u201cFundamentally mutations, especially here, are nothing to worry about ... it is just some kind of minor typo [in the genome] that are either neutral or actually often not favourable to the virus.\u201d<br><br><a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.21.108506v1\">The study</a>, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, was carried out by a team of researchers in the UK and France, who scrutinised more than 15,000 coronavirus genomes collected from patients around the world since the outbreak began. <br><br>Across all the genomes they uncovered 6,822 mutations in total, relative to the ancestral genome, but none of the genomes showed more than 29 single position changes.<br><br tabindex=\"-1\">Further analysis revealed 273 of the mutations cropped up repeatedly \u2013 with the team focusing on the 31 mutations that appear to have arisen independently at least 10 times.<br><br tabindex=\"-1\">\u201cThere is no such thing as a European strain, an American strain, an Icelandic strain- there has been a lot of mixing from the beginning of the pandemic,\u201d said Balloux. <br><br tabindex=\"-1\">\u201cIf there is a mutation that appears and makes it transmit better, then we should see it happening multiple times,\u201d he added. \u201cIf you have a mutation that happened once over the pandemic, then that is most unlikely to be something beneficial [to the virus].\u201d<br><br tabindex=\"-1\">They then looked at whether these mutations made the virus more transmissible. \u201cWe just work out whether the ones that carry a mutation, whether they have more descendants, whether they are actually spreading faster [than closely related genomes without the mutation] \u2013 and the answer is no,\u201d said Balloux, adding the mutations could be introduced by enzymes involved in the body\u2019s immune system. In fact, the team says, some of the mutations studied seem to be actually harmful to the virus.<br><br tabindex=\"-1\">Balloux added that while there is not enough data as yet to explore whether mutations may make the virus more deadly or cause more severe symptoms, he said it is unlikely.<br><br tabindex=\"-1\">\u201cViruses don\u2019t benefit from killing their hosts.

The home secretary, Priti Patel, is expected to unveil the plans at the daily Downing Street briefing later. The measures, which will be introduced next month, will be reviewed every three weeks, the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, said. Tony Smith, a former head of Border Force, said he was surprised quarantine measures had not been brought in sooner.</p> \n  <p><strong>Sir Paul Nurse: \u2018We are desperate for clear leadership\u2019</strong></p> \n  <p>Sir Paul Nurse, the chief executive of the Francis Crick Institute and 2001 Nobel laureate for medicine, has delivered a scathing attack on the government\u2019s handling of the crisis. \u201cWe are desperate for clear leadership at all levels,\u201d he told the BBC. He said the UK had been \u201ctoo much on the back foot, increasingly playing catchup\u201d.</p> \n  <p><strong>Care home boss calls for repeat testing</strong></p> \n  <p>Weekly testing of all residents and staff could help ease the Covid-19 outbreak in care homes, the boss of one of the UK\u2019s largest care providers said. Sam Monaghan, chief executive of MHA, which took part in a government pilot of whole-home testing, said asymptomatic cases meant the virus could spread without being noticed. He said: \u201cWhat we\u2019re saying is either once a week or once a fortnight. Some of the research that seems to have been done would suggest that weekly would be the most effective way. There was a real reluctance to test staff. They were going to test the residents but they were not going to test the staff. But that was the most highly likely way the infection could have come into the home.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Government borrowing hits record \u00a362bn in April</strong></p> \n  <p>UK government borrowing hit its highest level on record last month amid the Covid-19 pandemic, as retail sales across the country plunged at a record pace. The Office for National Statistics reported that public borrowing in April is estimated to have surged to \u00a362.1bn. That\u2019s \u00a351.1bn more than in April 2019, and the highest borrowing in any month since records began in January 1993.</p> \n  <p><strong>Independent Sage warns against school reopening plan</strong></p> \n  <p>The Independent Sage committee has warned that 1 June is too soon for schools to reopen safely and that more time is needed to set up an effective track and trace system to contain future outbreaks. The group, chaired by the former government chief scientist Sir David King, says that new modelling of the coronavirus shows the risk to children will be halved if they return to school two weeks later than ministers propose. Delaying until September reduced the risk still further. A straw poll of Unison members working in schools in England found that the vast majority remain concerned over the safety of their workplaces opening to more pupils on 1 June.</p> \n  <p><strong>New spitting incident at a London station</strong></p> \n  <p>Union leaders have condemned another \u201cdisgusting and frightening\u201d spitting incident at a London station. The Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) said a man approached staff at Mile End London underground station on Thursday and demanded they open the gate as he did not have a ticket for the barriers. He became aggressive and swore at an older female customer who intervened, and spat at her, said the union. British Transport Police were called and spit samples were taken from the female customer\u2019s face and arm.

Delaying until September reduced the risk still further.</p> \n  <p>The extra two weeks would allow more time for infections to fall in the community and for crucial track and trace capacity to be built up so that new cases are found and isolated fast. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIt is clear from the evidence we have collected that 1 June is simply too early to go back. By going ahead with this dangerous decision, the government is further risking the health of our communities and the likelihood of a second spike,\u201d Professor King said. </p> \n  <p>In a draft consultation published on Friday, the experts say local authorities must demonstrate low levels of infection and an ability to contain new infections before schools are reopened, with public consultation a \u201cvital\u201d part of the decision-making process.</p> \n  <p>The report urges authorities to consider summer camps and outdoor schools for educating children with community playing fields and sports clubs requisitioned for teaching purposes.</p> \n  <p>King said the decision of when to re-open schools was a \u201ccareful balance\u201d but added it was vital for young people to get back to the classroom as soon as it was safe to do so. \u201cThe current climate is likely to disproportionately affect the most disadvantaged in society, therefore it is vital that the government also considers innovative ways to help those who need it most.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>Professor King established the Independent Sage committee amid concerns over the lack of transparency around scientific advice reaching ministers from the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), co-chaired by the chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance and England\u2019s chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty. </p> \n  <p>Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the school leaders\u2019 union NAHT, said: \u201cSupport for a fixed date for school return is vanishing quickly. What is needed now is local flexibility to determine when it is right for schools to open up to more pupils, informed by evidence of what is happening in their local area.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The Independent Sage committee will host an online discussion at midday on Friday for teachers, parents, children and union representatives in association with the British Medical Journal and Mumsnet.

  "<p>The British Grand Prix faces a race against time to resolve the problem created by the government\u2019s imposition of quarantine on all entry into the UK. The chances of the race at Silverstone being held <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/19/british-grand-prix-decision-expected-by-the-end-of-this-week\" title=\"\">look increasingly slim</a> but Formula One is understood to be remaining in a dialogue with the government in an attempt to find a solution.</p> <p>F1 is studying the full quarantine document before entering into further talks with the government.

I\u2019m very, very conscious that it\u2019s extremely complicated drafting these things and working up against ever-moving deadlines.</p> <p>\u201cI remain optimistic that a sensible and pragmatic solution, which puts the onus on the sport quite rightly to come up with the right solution, can be found.\u201d</p> <p>The home secretary, Priti Patel, confirmed the quarantine restrictions on Friday, which will begin on 8 June. The measures will be reviewed every three weeks but with F1 intent on starting the season in early July, any review would likely be too late for the British GP to maintain its current slot.</p> <p>The F1 season is due to get under way with two races in Austria, the first on 5 July. Silverstone was scheduled to host two races, one of which would have been the British Grand Prix, on 26 July and 5 August. However, with the 14-day quarantine imposed neither race at Silverstone can be held and are expected to be replaced by meetings at Hockenheim in Germany or potentially in Budapest.</p> <p>Alongside the Italian GP, the British Grand Prix is the only meeting to have been held every year since the F1 world championship began at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/13/noise-and-smoke-silverstone-f1-blast-off-70-years-go\" title=\"\">Silverstone in 1950</a>. There remains a chance the race could be scheduled for later in the year if the quarantine restrictions are relaxed but with F1 attempting to finalise the European leg of the season, the focus will be on confirming any meetings that can definitely go ahead.</p> <p>The current quarantine rules also present further complications for F1 as it attempts to build a new calendar. Seven of the 10 F1 teams are based in the UK. On their return to the UK, a 14-day quarantine would mean a three-week gap before the next race could take place. During that period none of the team members that have travelled would be able to work at their respective factories.</p> <p>F1 could have to construct a calendar working on the basis that the quarantine restriction may remain in place for the rest of the year depending on the outcome of its conversations with government.</p> <p>Triple-header and even quadruple-header meetings are being considered, to maximise the teams\u2019 use of time before each enforced break. The teams are understood to be willing to adapt to meet these demands in order to begin racing again.</p> <p>After the opening four races and the first quarantine period, the expectation is of a further four. They are likely to be held without teams returning to the UK and consisting of one of Hockenheim or Budapest, then Spain, Spa and Monza. When the sport begins the flyaway part of the season, these races would also have to be held in tranches, with three-week gaps between each. Currently under consideration are Azerbaijan, Russia, China and Japan as one block, then the US, Mexico and Brazil, followed by Vietnam, Bahrain and Abu Dhabi to conclude the season.</p>",

And the government should go further by removing the charge for all migrant workers.\u201d</p> \n<p>Charities supporting migrants say they are seeing huge debt problems caused by low-paid workers having to find thousands in fees. The surcharge is paid as a \u00a31,000 fee every two and a half years along with other visa fees.</p> \n<p>Nazek Ramadan, the director of charity Migrant Voice, also said the NHS surcharge should be waived for all migrant workers.</p> \n<p>She said: \u201cThe partial U-turn by the government doesn\u2019t go nearly far enough. From October, a family of four renewing their 2.5-year visas will have to pay \u00a36,240 just for the NHS surcharge \u2013 that\u2019s on top of the \u00a34,000 cost of the visas. Just like British workers, migrants contribute to the NHS through taxes. This surcharge is not only unfair, but, added to the extortionate cost of work visas, crippling for many.</p> \n<p>\u201cAt our meetings with our members, we learn that teaching assistants, cleaners, bus drivers and other workers across the country are drowning in debt and struggle to feed their children. To abolish the charge for some but not others is cruel and indefensible.

We hope to document and pay tribute to those who have died working on the frontline of the pandemic.</p> <p>We will be adding the cases to a database and hope to examine these deaths in more detail at a later date.</p> <h2>Joselito Habab</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"bb995b97a8bd65f17bf2693a6622f4fd83abdb4d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb995b97a8bd65f17bf2693a6622f4fd83abdb4d/80_28_647_809/400.jpg\" alt=\"Joselito Habab\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joselito Habab.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Warrington and Halton teaching hospitals NHS trust/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Nurse<br><strong>Place of work:</strong> Warrington hospital<br><strong>Date of death:</strong> 20 May 2020</p> <p>Habab contracted Covid-19 while working on the frontline of the pandemic, and died in the early hours of 20 May.

  "<p>My wife received a text from a friend recently, asking her to thank me for something I had said about home schooling. My wife told me this, and followed up with the question: \u201cWhat the hell do you know about home schooling?!\u201d I decided to interpret her tone as playful rather than laced with rage, but she is absolutely right.</p> <p>I have been spending an increasing amount of time working, which means my involvement in home schooling has evaporated. I am upstairs while the kids do home school with their mum, seeing me only when I pop downstairs to ask them to keep it down a bit, which I imagine makes my wife love me even more. In my defence, I only do this when I am recording voiceovers, a home setup that requires me to cover myself in a duvet to deaden any echo and use my phone as a torch inside my makeshift tent. (Remember that if you happen to watch anything with my voice on it during lockdown.)</p> <p>My wife and I are both from teaching backgrounds, and everyone assumes we are finding this an absolute doddle. They imagine we dust off the whiteboard that we have knocking about for whenever we fancy some role play, and deliver the curriculum to our children in a manner that is superior to them actually being at school.</p> <p>The reality is that we try and fail to log in to the websites that the school needs us to, before discovering the work requires us to print something out. Our printer, which has been sitting in a corner next to the ab roller, has been called out of retirement only to have us bang the top of it repeatedly while screaming: \u201cWhy would the school set work that means we have to print stuff?!\u201d</p> <p>The fact that I am spending nowhere near as much time with the children as my wife is something I feel increasingly guilty about. There will, hopefully, never be a period in our lives like this again, with the opportunity to spend so much time together as a family. I have decided, therefore, to engage with them as much as possible when I finish work, joining them for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/fortnite\" title=\"\">Fortnite</a> discussions and letting them help me to a level of proficiency that will stop kids from Pittsburgh calling me a bot. We talk about skins; I pretend to understand when they give me instructions; and they pretend not to be annoyed that I continue to make progress at a pace a sloth would take the piss out of.</p> <p>Does this make me a great parent? They are put through their educational paces by their doting mother, and pulled into line when they mess about. Once they\u2019ve finished doing that, Dad comes over with the figurative ice-cream and lollipops. \u201cOh, enough of that boring woman, guys: Fun Dad is here!\u201d</p> <p>I was pondering the unfairness of this while playing with the boys the other night. \u201cI must figure out a solution,\u201d I thought to myself. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m just <em>too</em> much fun?\u201d</p> <p>It was then that the boys finally plucked up the courage to ask if they could abandon me for a bit to play with their actual friends online. I realised I wasn\u2019t Fun Dad at all. They were having just as miserable a time with me as they were doing home school, which I consider job done.

  "<p>As the coronavirus spreads around the world, there are concerns that it will mutate into a form that is more transmissible, more dangerous or both, potentially making the global health crisis even worse. What do we know about the way the virus is evolving?</p> \n<h2>Is the virus mutating?</h2> \n<p>All viruses mutate and the Sars-Cov-2 coronavirus that causes Covid-19 is no exception. Mutations arise when the virus replicates inside cells and mistakes are made in copying its genetic code. Unlike humans, whose genes are written in double-stranded DNA, the coronavirus genes are carried on single-stranded RNA.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>How fast is the virus mutating?</h2> \n<p>The coronavirus is actually quite stable. Scientists have analysed about 13,000 samples in Britain since mid-March and found that new mutations appear roughly twice a month. The rate of mutations is important because the faster a virus mutates, the quicker it changes behaviour. A fast-evolving virus can be harder to make a vaccine against because by the time it has been developed, the parts of the virus the immune system attacks might have changed. Seasonal influenza mutates so rapidly we need a different vaccine each year.</p> \n<h2>How does coronavirus vary around the world?</h2> \n<p>The genetic code from coronaviruses around the globe show that it splits into groups as it spreads. There is nothing unusual about this. <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/117/17/9241\">Researchers in Germany</a> identified three main genetic groups of the virus in April, which they named A, B and C. Groups A and C are mostly found in Europeans and Americans, while group B is most common in East Asia. But there are smaller groups too, which scientists can use to trace infections back to their sources, and ultimately back to a region such as Wuhan or northern Italy.</p> \n<h2>Why do mutations matter?</h2> \n<p>Mutations happen by chance all the time. Most have little effect, and some hamper the virus, but over time single or multiple mutations can potentially build up that make the virus more successful by enabling it to spread more easily. Mutations can also make the virus more dangerous, for example by making it more efficient at infecting cells.</p> \n<h2>What mutations has the virus picked up?</h2> \n<p>A number of mutations have caught scientists\u2019 attention. Researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine studied more than 5,000 coronavirus genomes from around the world and discovered <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.28.066977v1\">several mutations</a> that may be evidence of the virus adapting to humans. Two mutations are in the critical \u201cspike\u201d protein that the virus uses to invade cells.</p> \n<p>The spike mutations are rare at the moment, but Martin Hibberd, a professor of emerging infectious diseases and a senior author on the study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, said their emergence highlighted the need for global surveillance of the virus. That will reveal whether the new mutations help it to spread and whether vaccines may need to be redesigned.</p> \n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.29.069054v1\">another preliminary study</a>, scientists at Sheffield University and Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico found similar mutations in the spike protein which the authors claim may help the infection to spread. While that is possible, other scientists believe it is too early to know whether any of the mutations are helping the virus thrive.</p> \n<p>Prof Nick Loman at the University of Birmingham said that all coronaviruses are very similar and that viruses with particular mutations can rise up in different areas for a range of reasons. A major factor is which virus gains a foothold first, the so-called founder effect, which may come down to one person\u2019s travel plans rather than any adaptation of the virus. \u201cFrom the point of view of people who are understandably concerned about this pandemic, I\u2019m sure it will not matter which mutations the virus has. It\u2019s not a good virus either way,\u201d he said. \u201cWe look to see if any of the mutations change behaviour and we don\u2019t have any evidence for that.\u201d</p> \n<p>But there is some reason for hope. <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.21.108506v1\">Another preliminary study</a>, this time by researchers in the UK and US, revealed that after looking at more than 15,000 coronavirus genomes from patients around the world, scientists found no sign the virus is becoming more transmissible \u2013 in other words it is not becoming easier to pass from person to person.</p> \n<p>The team found 6,822 mutations in total, relative to the ancestral genome, however none of the genomes showed more than 29 single position changes, known as SNPs. The researchers then focused on 31 mutations that appear to have arisen independently at least 10 times.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf there is a mutation that appears and makes it transmit better, then we should see it happening multiple times,\u201d said Prof Francois Balloux, a co-author of the research at University College London. However the team found these mutations either had a neutral impact on the virus, or were actually detrimental to it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2>What else can mutations tell us?</h2> \n<p>As scientists learn more about the genetic makeup of coronaviruses, they will be able to use the information to trace an individual\u2019s infection to nearby clusters and ultimately back to its origin. That can be useful for tracing outbreaks and spotting newly imported infections. But intense monitoring will also flag up how the virus mutates and acquires resistance to and drugs and vaccines that are used in the future. \u201cAs those become available, we would expect to see functional mutations just like with see with antibiotic resistance in bacteria,\u201d Loman said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"04fcb605-dc6b-400f-9a32-dea28497dcee\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sMtzWVTPmLI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",
  "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>Just when you think things can\u2019t get much more surreal, we hear that Donald Trump has been dosing himself up with the anti-malarial drug <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/19/hydroxychloroquine-trump-and-covid-19-what-you-need-to-know\">hydroxychloroquine</a> in efforts to ward off the coronavirus that he doesn\u2019t yet have. \u201cI\u2019m taking it for about a week and a half now and I\u2019m still here, I\u2019m still here,\u201d he told reporters during a White House briefing. Given that hydroxychloroquine is not a vaccine, is completely unproven as a treatment for Covid-19 and can have dangerous side-effects, you can only wonder about the president\u2019s state of mind. And that of his medical team who are happily prescribing him a drug that is far more likely to do him harm than good. Next he\u2019ll be hooking himself up on a ventilator at night. I thought my hypochondria was bad \u2013 I\u2019ve lost count of the number of times over the past 10 weeks when I\u2019ve woken up with a slight headache or the merest hint of a sore throat and imagined I had the virus \u2013 but it\u2019s never occurred to me to start dosing myself up with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/remdesivir-the-antiviral-drug-is-being-touted-as-a-possible-coronavirus-treatment-but-will-it-work\">remdesivir</a>. It would be like me marching into the doctor\u2019s and demanding to be put on a course of chemotherapy on the off chance that I had cancer. Or having elective surgery to remove my appendix to ensure that I don\u2019t get peritonitis.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>Two weeks back my daughter was tidying her garden in Minneapolis when she came across a small burrow of tiny, furless animals, with their eyes shut, that were clearly no more than a day or so old. She sent me a picture and we wondered if they might be moles, before someone pointed out they were above ground, had large ears and were obviously rabbits. Anna even got round to setting up a webcam so she could check up on them at all times, and we got used to watching the mother returning from time to time to feed them and scrape her fur to keep them warm. At a time when so much else in the world seemed so bleak, they came to represent something new and hopeful. A week or so ago, we got the call that we had been dreading. The webcam had picked up a neighbour\u2019s cat entering the burrow. When Anna went out to check up on them, there was no sign of the bunnies. Then today, Anna was looking out of her kitchen window and spotted a small rabbit at the bottom of her garden. It was almost certainly from a different burrow, but I would like to believe it was one that had escaped the carnage and come back to let us know that just occasionally the natural world can provide a happy ending.</p> <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> <p>Boris Johnson sold himself to many voters at the last election as the great communicator: the leader who could unite a divided country and get Brexit done. So it\u2019s been a surprise to find just how invisible he\u2019s been since recovering from the coronavirus. He\u2019s given one confusing TV statement \u2013 with no questions allowed \u2013 and sent out junior cabinet ministers in his place at the Downing Street press conference. One explanation for his absenteeism over the last week has been that he was so wounded by his mauling from Keir Starmer at prime minister\u2019s questions that he had spent the last seven days preparing for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/20/this-time-boris-is-better-prepared-but-the-qc-still-gets-under-his-skin-pmqs-john-crace\">this week\u2019s encounter</a>. If so, it only partially paid off: Boris was much more of his usual aggressive, unpleasant self, but the Labour leader still came out comfortably ahead on points. Not least because Boris insisted that all those overseas nationals who were working on low salaries in the NHS would have to pay a visa surcharge of \u00a3624 to access health services if they got ill while doing their jobs of trying to keep the rest of us alive. It was so obviously unjust and immoral that Boris was shamed into doing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/johnson-forced-to-drop-nhs-surcharge-for-migrant-health-workers\">massive U-turn</a> the following day. There was no screeching reversal, however, on him forcing through a vote preventing MPs from accessing Commons proceedings remotely at a time when the official government policy is still for people to work from home if they possibly can. When recess ends in 10 days\u2019 time, the only MPs able to join in the debate will be the 50 or so allowed in under the physical distancing guidelines. So MPs from constituencies remote from London will be in effect disenfranchised. Some would call it a scandal. Boris calls it taking back control.</p> <h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> <p>We need to talk about Kevin. Again. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/15/zoom-dog-groom-how-stay-alert-covid-19-boris-johnson\">Last week</a> I wrote about my friend Kevin\u2019s experience of coronavirus testing as performance art. What neither of us had realised was that he was only in the first act of the play. Two weeks to the day after his initial test, for which he was never able to get the results, he was offered a second test. On Monday this week he went off to have that second test. The following day a result of \u201cunclear\u201d arrived back, so a further test was required. However, what was also unclear was whether the result was from the first or second test. Kevin rang the ironically named helpdesk which, as ever, had no information and put him on hold for several minutes. After a discussion with all of his colleagues, the adviser reported back that they had unanimously concluded that the result couldn\u2019t have come from the second test as they had never known of an instance when the system had been that efficient. So on the basis of their absolute certainty of the incompetence of the system, they say he should ring back next Monday to find out if the series is to be extended to a third test. And the government wonders why the whole country doesn\u2019t share its excitement when it announces a new testing programme.</p> <h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019ve watched more of the Downing Street press briefings than I care to remember and will have to endure many more before the pandemic is over. Though sadly I will miss <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/22/priti-patel-to-outline-coronavirus-quarantine-plan-for-travellers-to-uk\">Priti Patel\u2019s outing</a> this evening as the home secretary is such a liability she is only allowed out in public when no sketch writers are writing for the following day. Already though, there are signs that the government is regretting its decision to give the country daily updates, not least because more often than not the minister taking the press conference \u2013 Boris has long since decided these are too much like hard work and can\u2019t be bothered to turn up \u2013 has nothing new to announce. So on Thursday we were treated to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/21/matt-hancock-is-not-ok-someone-really-ought-to-furlough-him\">Matt Hancock</a> running through the same slides that have been used in every other briefing for the past two weeks, before being forced to admit that the \u201cworld-beating\u201d test, track and trace app that he had insisted only a month or so ago would be a game-changer in easing lockdown restrictions wasn\u2019t going to be ready in time. And, in any case, it wasn\u2019t such a big deal as all that and had only ever been intended to be an adjunct to human track and trace. Most of us would just settle for solutions that were good enough to make a difference. Still, in these days of existential despair, just occasionally something remarkable does happen. I had been checking on the status of my exercise bike I had ordered from Amazon and had been informed that the one I had ordered was now indefinitely unavailable, so I had mentally prepared myself for the likelihood it would never appear. Then, out of the blue, I got an email saying it would arrive on 3 June. Even more remarkably, it turned up two weeks early and was comparatively simple to assemble. It has been the best \u00a3229 I have spent for a long time. Nearly an hour free from anxiety about the coronavirus and thoughts of missing my family and friends. What more could anyone want?</p> <p><strong>Digested week, digested: </strong>Starmer 3-0 Johnson.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4cd4a178b1cde58680e77999792ca23d6a098105\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4cd4a178b1cde58680e77999792ca23d6a098105/0_67_5455_3274/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brighton beach\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Picture of the week: \u2018We shall fight the coronavirus on the beaches.

  "<p>\u2018It\u2019s like the seven stages of grief,\u201d says <a href=\"http://www.paulavarjack.com/\">Paula Varjack</a>, of the way Covid-19 has affected the world of theatre. As a freelance theatre-maker, Varjack will no longer be launching two new shows this summer at the Edinburgh fringe \u2013 the fruit of years of careful strategy \u2013 while all her other engagements are indefinitely on ice. But after the denial, anger, bargaining etc, Varjack thought she might at least end up at some sort of acceptance; maybe she could even come to see the closure of theatres as an opportunity to reimagine the art form wholesale. There\u2019s been some of this, says Varjack, but she\u2019s also realised that grieving for your livelihood \u2013 for your whole vanishing industry \u2013 isn\u2019t simply a process. \u201cIt\u2019s a cycle,\u201d she says.</p> <p>I\u2019m struggling to get past the shock stage myself, and I\u2019m not (or at least, no longer) a freelance artist \u2013 although as artistic director of <a href=\"https://www.cptheatre.co.uk/\">Camden People\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://www.cptheatre.co.uk/\">theatre</a>, I work closely with many of them. The point of CPT is to support emerging theatre-makers, particularly those making innovative or socially engaged work, so that they can get a foothold in the industry. We\u2019re only as good as the artists we work with \u2013 and those artists are, in the era of Covid-19, in serious trouble. Those we\u2019re closest to \u2013 artists from marginalised backgrounds, and at the fragile start of their careers \u2013 are more vulnerable than most as their work dries up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3d01e78454ccde187f79d883c324c864c19d62a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d01e78454ccde187f79d883c324c864c19d62a7/0_0_2316_3088/750.jpg\" alt=\"Bryony Kimmings\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Creative energy ... superstar live artist Bryony Kimmings has raised \u00a340,000 through her #GigAid support scheme</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not that support hasn\u2019t been made available. There\u2019s the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/13/uk-self-employed-coronavirus-scheme-attracts-110000-claims-in-first-hours\">Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS)</a>, and the Arts Council\u2019s emergency fund for creative practitioners. But the Arts Council can\u2019t cater for everyone: <a href=\"https://www.rashdash.co.uk/just-some-thinking\">some terrific artists have been refused funding</a>. And many more aren\u2019t eligible for the government\u2019s offer. Those whose income derives jointly from PAYE and freelance work can find themselves excluded. So too artists whose income is too small, those who\u2019ve freelanced for less than a year and foreign nationals whose visa status disqualifies them. Together, those categories cover <em>a lot</em> of theatre-makers; 70% of the industry\u2019s workforce is self-employed. Many are now left with no earning power and no institutional support.</p> <p>In its place, there is at least solidarity. I\u2019ve been speaking to freelancers about their plight, and everyone comments on the spirit of mutuality that\u2019s come to the fore. At CPT, we financially compensated all the artists whose shows were cancelled when we shut down \u2013 possible mainly because audience members donated the cost of their tickets, and several fellow artists \u201cpaid forward\u201d their cancellation fees. Elsewhere, superstar live artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/mar/16/uk-theatre-coronavirus-cancellations\">Bryony Kimmings initiated her #GigAid support scheme</a>, raising \u00a340,000 for artists who\u2019d lost work due to Covid-19, while theatre-maker Scottee offered <a href=\"https://www.scottee.co.uk/post/2020/03/20/room-to-respond-2020\">paid mentoring sessions</a> for producers and artists, and micro-commissions to create digital work for home viewing. Online round-tables and peer support networks have proliferated.</p> <p>I spoke to the artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/nov/27/the-ex-boyfriend-yard-sale-haley-mcgee\">Haley McGee</a>, whose <a href=\"http://www.haleymcgee.ca/creative-quarantine-challenge\">14-Day Creative Quarantine Challenge</a> is an online programme for artists seeking to stay creative during lockdown. It\u2019s been so successful \u2013 more than 1,100 people have signed up \u2013 that McGee has had to automate the service. Manchester\u2019s Contact theatre had a similar initiative, <a href=\"https://contactmcr.com/development/a-weeks-notice/\">A Week\u2019s Notice</a> (\u201cFor seven weeks, seven freelance artists each suggest seven creative ideas to help you Take Notice \u2026\u201d), aimed at safeguarding the mental health of the isolated \u2013 and giving artists work. \u201cPeople want to be doing something,\u201d says McGee. \u201cNot just watching more live streams. We\u2019re already all watching too much TV.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"288d132df3122f614b7f5964407b6edde5d41761\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/288d132df3122f614b7f5964407b6edde5d41761/0_345_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theatre-maker Scottee at 2019\u2019s Edinburgh Fringe\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peer support networks abound ... theatre-maker Scottee has offered paid mentoring sessions for producers and artists.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I hosted a Zoom meeting from CPT the other week, to reunite six artists we\u2019d been supporting to develop new shows before the lockdown struck. Mid-conversation, one of the participants announced: \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve felt like an artist in four weeks.\u201d It\u2019s not just artists\u2019 jobs that have evaporated, it\u2019s their identities \u2013 which, without work, can start to feel very brittle. To have no income is bad; to have no role or purpose in the so-called \u201cnew normal\u201d is worse.</p> <p>Which partly explains the current boom of theatre online. Here, the National Theatre streams its greatest hits. There, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/may/03/gateshead-international-festival-of-theatre-review\">Gateshead International </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/may/03/gateshead-international-festival-of-theatre-review\">festival</a> takes place, to great acclaim, on Zoom, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/dec/06/forest-fringe-diy-theatre\">indie collective Forest Fringe</a> launches Forest Fringe TV. It\u2019s a tribute to the sector\u2019s indomitability: if we can\u2019t find audiences in our auditoriums, we\u2019ll hunt them down in their homes instead. It\u2019s an exciting creative challenge in itself. Paula Varjack\u2019s live work has a digital element; now she\u2019s exploring how to make digital work with a spirit of liveness. \u201cI\u2019m seeing it as just another form to play with,\u201d she says. \u201cIt feels like there\u2019s a lot of genuine experimentation happening right now, which people are receiving in an open and forgiving way.\u201d </p> <p>But there\u2019s a flipside. Some see the rush to digital as a panic \u2013 and that the urge to show how easily theatre can be reproduced online downplays what makes it unique. Some feel under pressure to deliver #content, while lacking the skills to do so. \u201cI haven\u2019t been excited at watching a single filmed show,\u201d says the <a href=\"https://anniesiddons.co.uk/\">theatre-maker and playwright Annie Siddons</a>. \u201cI\u2019m not a film director,\u201d she says. \u201cThe skill sets are different. And those who don\u2019t have video material good to go are panicking, because they\u2019re not being swept up in the new wave of digital content splurging. They\u2019re just feeling even more left behind.\u201d</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the concern that digital \u2013 and the effects of the lockdown more widely \u2013 privilege the well-resourced and entrench elitism. To make and distribute digital theatre successfully, it helps to have resources, staff, an archive of recorded performance and an established audience. And then: how on earth do you monetise it? David Loumgair runs the sector support organisation <a href=\"https://commontheatre.co.uk/\">Common</a>, which represents working-class theatre-makers. He\u2019s concerned that recent progress towards diversity will be reversed by the lockdown, citing a recent commission that offered \u00a3150 for new digital work \u2013 \u201cbarely enough to cover the artist\u2019s time,\u201d he says, \u201cfar less the up-skilling required.\u201d The website What\u2019s On Stage also drew heavy criticism when its Lockdown Playwriting prize offered only \u00a3500 for new hour-long playscripts. It has since <a href=\"https://artspod.net/news/whats-on-stage-announces-lockdown-playwriting-prize-in-collaboration-with-the-turbine-theatre/\">cancelled the prize</a>.</p> <p>But then, freelance artists have always been taken for granted. If there\u2019s a positive right now, it\u2019s that the exploitation and insecurity has become impossible to ignore. <a href=\"http://exeuntmagazine.com/features/theatres-left-behind-freelancers/\">Research at the online magazine Exeunt</a> into the plight of freelancers ineligible for government support found that 40% are considering a career change, 1 in 3 are experiencing housing insecurity, and over half are struggling with depression and anxiety because of their financial situation. It is alarming \u2013 and yet different only by degrees, perhaps, from many artists\u2019 pre-lockdown experience of freelance theatre practice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c669481ee210aac2cf94bca807761e74d4f7f58\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c669481ee210aac2cf94bca807761e74d4f7f58/0_0_3996_2712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dominic Garfield in a pre-lockdown performance of Early Days of A Better Nation by Tom Bowtell\" width=\"1000\" height=\"679\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s time for something new\u2019 ...

He told me that current conditions aren\u2019t such a change for HighRise, who are all too familiar with job insecurity and living hand-to-mouth. They\u2019re also, like most independent theatre-makers I know, light on their feet and resourceful, which can be useful skills in a crisis.</p> <p>Garfield\u2019s experience of lockdown so far has been perfunctory treatment from several venues with whom HighRise had bookings (being strung along; gigs cancelled at the last-minute; no compensation), and small acts of generosity from others. With emergency funding from the Arts Council secured, they can at least sustain \u2013 albeit digitally \u2013 their New Gens project with young people. Garfield also hopes to put the company\u2019s recent show <a href=\"https://www.roundhouse.org.uk/whats-on/2018/last-word-2018-/lil-miss-lady/\">Lil.Miss.Lady</a> online, but won\u2019t consider charging for it (\u201cwe\u2019re competing with people who can do screen entertainment a lot better than us\u201d) and won\u2019t do so until he\u2019s worked out how to generate online the crackling sense of event that attended its live performances.</p> <p>Can that be done? What does \u201cliveness\u201d even mean in the era of coronavirus, when our closest relationships are mediated by screens, and a crowded room could be a death sentence? Everyone in theatre knows that, even after the lockdown is lifted, there\u2019s no quick return to normal for an art form that draws its lifeblood from \u201csocial gathering\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t know what theatre <em>is</em> now,\u201d says Garfield. \u201cBut I know that it\u2019s dumb to think about it. It\u2019s time for something new.\u201d</p> <p>Maybe that \u201csomething new\u201d can be a revolution in how the industry treats its freelancers. There\u2019s been much discussion of <a href=\"https://davidjubb.blog/2020/04/25/time-to-change/\">a blog posted by ex-Battersea Arts Centre director David Jubb</a>, proposing a new funding model that delivers money not to buildings and organisations, but straight to artists. Might the worst of times also be the best of times? Some see an \u201cincredibly exciting opportunity\u201d (<a href=\"http://exeuntmagazine.com/features/dialogue-making-work-collectively/\">in the words of performance-maker Xavier de Sousa</a>) to reimagine what theatre is and how it\u2019s made. Others, justifiably, can\u2019t see past this month\u2019s rent payment, and simply long to be back in a theatre, doing what they do. </p> <p>\u201cWhat I really want,\u201d says Varjack, \u201cis to be able to perform the shows I\u2019ve developed in a live space as soon as possible. But that\u2019s not going to happen any time soon.\u201d</p>",

\n  <p>The prime minister, <strong>Scott Morrison</strong>, announces jobkeeper on 30 March:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>\u201cToday, I announce that we are committing $130bn over the next six months to support the jobs and livelihoods of what we anticipate are being almost <strong>six million</strong> Australians, who will need that lifeline in the months ahead.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Around 900,000 employers and sole traders express interest, and then enrolments commence in mid-April.</p> \n  <p>The treasurer, <strong>Josh Frydenberg</strong>, reports on 24 April that around 400,000 employers, covering 2.5 million employees have enrolled.</p> \n  <p>In his address to parliament on 12 May, Frydenberg says:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>\u201cThere are now more than 835,000 businesses employing more than 5.5 million workers who are formally enrolled in the program.\u201d </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Then on 14 May, the treasurer announces the number of people on jobkeeper \u201cnow exceeds six million\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Meanwhile, after collecting the tax file numbers and other information on eligible employees, the ATO begins paying out jobkeeper earlier this month.

That 1.3 million figure brings the unemployment rate to just under 10%.</p> \n  <p>It is suddenly looking like that unofficial unemployment rate just got a lot more official.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T05:13:31.722Z\">at 6.13am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec75c7f8f0864e579f15967\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T05:01:03.525Z\">6.01am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is a pretty fair take:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/lucethoughts/status/1263693519245291522\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAKING: Journalists stoked to learn they are no longer the worst at maths.</p>\u2014 Lucy Carter (@lucethoughts) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lucethoughts/status/1263693519245291522?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 22, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T05:11:41.142Z\">at 6.11am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec75c328f0864e579f15965\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T04:59:52.197Z\">5.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As has <strong>Adam Bandt</strong>:<br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AdamBandt/status/1263695310955544577\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Wow.<br><br>Suddenly $60b in already-budgeted funds available.<br><br>Let\u2019s:<br>- extend JobKeeper to all who need it, inc all casuals<br>- keep new JobSeeker rate <br>- have Jobs &amp; Income Guarantee for young people<br>- fund nation-building planet-saving projects to recover.<br><br>How would you spend $60b? <a href=\"https://t.co/McxLg7ou9V\">https://t.co/McxLg7ou9V</a></p>\u2014 Adam Bandt (@AdamBandt) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamBandt/status/1263695310955544577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 22, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec75c0c8f08a1782fa7f676\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T04:59:12.792Z\">5.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Jim Chalmers </strong>has already responded:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Another day, another shambles from a treasurer who just can\u2019t stop seriously stuffing up this key program. </p> \n   <p>This just shows you can\u2019t trust a hopeless government with a good idea like wage subsidies for workers. </p> \n   <p>After all the lectures about fiscal responsibility, Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg have had to admit to getting their numbers wrong by $60bn.</p> \n   <p>For weeks they\u2019ve been telling casuals and others that the program was full when in reality they were 3 million workers short. </p> \n   <p>If they can\u2019t get this basic maths right how can we expect them to get the recovery right?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T05:11:12.483Z\">at 6.11am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec75bcb8f08a1782fa7f675\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T04:58:19.513Z\">5.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Anthony Albanese </strong>has announced another doorstop on the back of the jobkeeper reporting screw-up news.</p> \n  <p>He\u2019ll be up at 3.45pm.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T05:10:32.095Z\">at 6.10am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec75a448f0864e579f15962\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T04:52:05.867Z\">5.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Not only is that $60bn now free, Australia\u2019s short- to medium-term economic outlooks, from the RBA to the government itself, have been based on $130bn being spent.

Instead of reporting how many employees were eligible, businesses reported how much they expected to receive for their employees.</p> \n  <p>In that way, one became 1,500.</p> \n  <p>We are not joking. Here is the official release.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Joint media release with the Australian Taxation Office</strong></p> \n  <p>Late yesterday, the ATO and Treasury advised the Government of a reporting error in estimates of the number of employees likely to access the JobKeeper program. <br></p> \n  <p><strong>The enrolment forms completed by 910,055 businesses who have self\u2011assessed as eligible under the scheme had indicated that this program would cover around 6.5 million eligible employees. <br></strong></p> \n  <p><strong>The ATO\u2019s review of these forms has found that around 1,000 of those businesses appear to have made significant errors when reporting the estimate of eligible employees on their enrolment form. </strong><br></p> \n  <p><strong>The most common error was that instead of reporting the number of employees they expected to be eligible, they reported the amount of assistance they expected to receive. </strong><br></p> \n  <p><strong>For example, over 500 businesses with \u20181\u2019 eligible employee reported a figure of \u20181,500\u2019 (which is the amount of JobKeeper payment they would expect to receive for each fortnight for that employee).</strong></p> \n  <p>This reporting error has come to light as the ATO and Treasury have been analysing the amounts being paid out under the scheme, reconciling these with the estimates provided by enrolled businesses of the likely number of eligible employees. It was not picked up by the ATO earlier as their primary focus in the first fortnight of JobKeeper payments was on ensuring that JobKeeper payments were paid promptly to those eligible for them, and not paid to those who were ineligible. These initial estimates from businesses of employees covered are not linked to payments, and so were not as carefully analysed.</p> \n  <p>Importantly this reporting error has no consequences for JobKeeper payments that have already been made to eligible businesses, as payments under the scheme depend on the subsequent declaration that an eligible business makes in relation to each and every eligible employee. This declaration does not involve estimates and requires an employer to provide the tax file number for each eligible employee. By contrast, the only use of the information collected in respect of the reporting error was to provide an early estimate of the number of expected employees likely to access the JobKeeper program.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T04:46:18.116Z\">at 5.46am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec756488f08a1782fa7f661\"

from stable to negative, but maintains its AAA rating from the Fitch ratings agency.</p> \n  <p>Ratings like this dictate how easy it for countries to borrow money, as well as the interest rates on those borrowings.</p> \n  <p>As AAP reports:<br></p> \n  <p>Fitch said it expects Australia\u2019s economic growth will fall sharply in 2020 and government spending in response to the health and economic crisis will cause large fiscal deficits and a sharp increase in government debt.</p> \n  <p>It forecast the $2tn economy to contract 5% this year driven by a plunge in economic activity during the second quarter due to virus containment measures.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cWhile these measures have effectively curbed the spread of the virus, they also constrained household consumption and reduced business sentiment and investment,\u201d Fitch said. </p> \n  <p>It expects a gradual economic recovery to begin in the second half of 2020 affirmed Australia\u2019s rating but said a downgrade is possible in the absence of a fiscal consolidation strategy or if there is economic or financial sector distress.</p> \n  <p>Fitch said fiscal deficits are set to swell at both the federal and state levels as a result of the discretionary fiscal measures such as the jobkeeper wage subsidy program and economic contraction. </p> \n  <p>It forecast the government deficit to rise to 6.9% of GDP in 2019-20 and 9.0% in 2020-21, from 1.2% in 2018-19.</p> \n  <p>Fitch\u2019s move follows a similar action by S&amp;P Global Ratings in April, when it downgraded the outlook on Australia from stable to negative as a result of the government\u2019s stimulus measures. <br></p> \n  <p>The federal treasurer,<strong> Josh Frydenberg</strong>, said Fitch\u2019s action is a reminder of the importance of maintaining medium-term fiscal sustainability. </p> \n  <p>\u201cOur measures are temporary, targeted and proportionate to the challenge we face and will ensure Australia bounces back stronger on the other side, without undermining the structural integrity of the budget which Australians have worked so hard to restore,\u201d he said in a statement.</p> \n </div> \n <p

  "<p>Voters will occasionally forgive a government they deem heartless, if they reckon it has the steel to get the job done. They might even, though rarely, forgive a government they deem incompetent, if they believe its heart is in the right place. What they will never forgive is a government that is both uncaring and useless. And yet that is precisely the judgment that now hovers over Boris Johnson and the administration he leads.</p> <p>Johnson had surely intuited as much when he performed his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/21/a-timeline-of-the-pms-u-turn-on-the-nhs-surcharge-a-timeline-of-pms-u-turn-nhs-surcharge-for-migrant-health-workers\">rubber-burning U-turn</a> late on Thursday, ditching his previous insistence, reiterated 24 hours earlier, that foreign-born NHS and care workers must pay an extra fee for the privilege of using a service that could not function without them. The notion of such a surcharge reeked of meanness of spirit, the demand that it increase from \u00a3400 to \u00a3624 stank. The hypocrisy was particularly pungent: even Scrooge didn\u2019t clap on the doorstep for those from whom he was squeezing every penny.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Public patience for a government that is incompetent will not last long</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Clearly in-house genius Dominic Cummings is losing his touch if he didn\u2019t see that one coming. Of course, the surcharge policy would have to be ditched. No government could be on the wrong side of health and care workers during a pandemic that has the nation clinging to doctors and nurses as its only protection. That would be true of a government that was handling things well. But it is triply true of a government handling things badly.</p> <p>No need to dwell on the excess deaths number, which suggests Britain will soon have lost as many people to coronavirus as it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/almost-55000-excess-uk-deaths-during-covid-19-outbreak-says-ons\">lost civilians</a> in the second world war. Contemplate instead the current situation, in which the government has already eased the lockdown in England and plans to ease it more on 1 June, even though it has not yet built a robust system that can find, test, trace and isolate new cases.</p> <p>Maybe it will all come good on the night. Perhaps at 11.55pm on 31 May, a breathless Matt Hancock will rush towards the Downing Street microphone to announce, still panting, that the contact-tracing app is online and the last contact-tracer is in place. But for now this looks like a government that has seen a cart and a horse and put them in the wrong order. Surely, the first move was to build the system that would keep the lid on any future outbreak and only then \u2013 once the app was tested and working, once the tracers were not merely recruited but fully trained, once the local health organisations best placed to run testing were involved \u2013 start lifting the restrictions that have kept the virus under relative control.</p> <p>Instead, the government is now hastily <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-easing-the-uk-out-of-lockdown-is-a-confidence-game-and-the-pm-is-losing-11991899\">changing its story</a>, explaining that an app previously touted as essential is now merely \u201cthe cherry on the cake\u201d, so there\u2019s no need for us to worry if it\u2019s not ready yet. The focus now, they tell us, is on those human contact tracers. Except they\u2019re not fully up to speed either. No wonder the NHS Confederation <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52748564\">is warning</a> of \u201ca second surge\u201d if the lockdown is eased any further.</p> <p>Cart-before-horse has become the repeating pattern. Johnson dumped the simple \u201cstay home\u201d advice for the opaque \u201cstay alert\u201d \u2013 prompting the number of Britons who regard the government\u2019s messaging as clear <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benatipsosmori/status/1263477716675973120?s=20\">to drop</a> from 90% to 56% \u2013 on 10 May while the daily death rate was still grievously high. He said people should be \u201cactively encouraged\u201d to return to their workplaces, before those places had been retooled for physical distancing. The inevitable result was to nudge people back on to trains and buses \u2013 regardless of his suggestion that they should avoid public transport \u2013 before he\u2019d ensured a sufficient, accessible supply of the face masks that the best advice suggests are necessary for such travel. He\u2019s doing it again now on schools, announcing a return date of 1 June <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/education/2020/05/reopening-schools-question-logistics-not-risks-teachers\">before</a> the extra teachers and classrooms are in place that would allow socially distanced teaching to be viable.</p> <p>Logic would dictate that you prepare first and, once that\u2019s done, you loosen the restrictions. Johnson\u2019s preferred method is to signal a relaxation, then scramble to put in place the mechanisms that might make that relaxation possible.</p> <p>The consequences of this \u201cact now, prepare later\u201d approach have been lethal. Witness the decision to release infected patients from hospital and back into care homes unequipped to receive them. Reporting by the BBC\u2019s Lewis Goodall <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lewis_goodall/status/1263219921124720640?s=20\">shows</a> that the more expensive homes had the staff, and the space, to keep the virus at bay and keep their residents alive; the cheaper ones worked staff round the clock with no PPE, and the disease duly ran riot. Incredibly, those well-resourced homes kept their residents alive in part by defying government instructions, imposing an early lockdown when the official advice was to keep the doors open.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/21/nhs-workers-bereavement-scheme-unfairness\">We forced the government to do right by NHS workers. Let\u2019s keep pressure on | Hassan Akkad</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Add that to the long list of flawed decisions \u2013 the 11-day delay to lockdown, the football matches and concerts that were not stopped, the airports that remained (and still remain) open to unhindered arrivals from all over the world, the abandonment of contact tracing in mid-March \u2013 and it\u2019s no surprise that the British Medical Journal (BMJ) <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1932\">declared</a> this week that \u201cthe UK\u2019s response so far has neither been well prepared nor remotely adequate\u201d. Some of that, the BMJ argues, goes back to decisions taken over several years, such as austerity and the \u201cdecimation\u201d of the country\u2019s local and regional public health capacity. That may predate Johnson\u2019s premiership, but it does not predate this government, which has been in power for a full 10 years. This is on them.</p> <p>So far the public has been patient. It has granted its leaders the benefit of the doubt, allowing that this is a global crisis not of their making. Crucially, it has wanted to believe that the government means well, even if it is stumbling. That\u2019s certainly been the perception of Johnson himself, who came so close to death at the hands of the virus. The surcharge row was a perilous moment because it shook that understanding, casting the government as lacking basic compassion.</p> <p>More such moments are coming. Why is it right that foreign-born porters, cleaners and care workers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YvetteCooperMP/status/1263501628692406272?s=20\">are excluded</a> from the automatic visa extension that has rightly been granted to doctors and nurses? Why is an army veteran who served this country, who worked and paid taxes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/19/british-army-veterans-children-call-on-government-to-waive-27000-nhs-bill\">landed</a> with a \u00a327,000 bill for treatment that would be free to everyone else? How could Johnson praise two migrant nurses for saving his life and then <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikegalsworthy/status/1263101739223232512?s=20\">say</a>, \u201cOn the other hand \u2026\u201d as he attempted to defend charging them to use the NHS they work for?</p> <p>He would be wise to learn the lesson of the reversal that was forced on him by an adroit Labour leader this week.

We may never know the true nationality of \u201cpatient zero\u201d in Europe. And it doesn\u2019t much matter, because the true patient zero in our continent is Europe itself.</p> <p>From the first detection of the virus on European territory, Europe has been in a coma.</p> <p>Long lockdowns and home confinement concealed the gravity of the patient\u2019s condition. With the freedom to move around even within countries taken away, few dared to cross borders. Now, as countries ease restrictive measures, Europe\u2019s true state of health is becoming clear.</p> <p>This is a dystopian outcome for millions of EU citizens who live in \u2013 or regularly commute to \u2013 another EU member state. With only a handful of countries reopening their borders, an unprecedented patchwork of national restrictions, including border controls and quarantine rules, continues to make travel across the continent practically impossible. After weeks of home confinement, many of us remain trapped in our country of residence or in that of origin, unable to cross borders again. Some of us can\u2019t visit families, rejoin their loved ones, go to their places of work, or even get home.</p> <p>While EU member states have the legal right temporarily to reintroduce internal border controls for reasons of public protection, and to lift them again, their decisions \u2013 as the French president Emmanuel Macron <a href=\"https://www.elysee.fr/emmanuel-macron/2020/03/12/adresse-aux-francais\">pledged</a> \u2013 \u201cmust be taken as Europeans, at the European level, because it\u2019s at this level that we\u2019ve constructed our freedoms and protections\u201d.</p> <p>Yet despite <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/communication_freemovement.pdf\">a timid attempt</a> by the European commission to coordinate the reopening of unrestricted cross-border movement within the union, the Schengen common-travel area remains in limbo, along with the lives of millions of EU citizens. If restrictions are easing, borders are not falling.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/how-coronavirus-is-reshaping-europe-in-dangerous-ways\">How coronavirus is reshaping Europe in dangerous ways</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most EU countries maintain controls and quarantine regulations on new entrants.

Denmark is opening its borders to Germany, but <a href=\"https://www.thelocal.se/20200515/danish-parties-ready-to-reopen-border-to-germany-but-not-to-sweden\">not to Sweden</a> \u2013 despite Sweden\u2019s southernmost region having a lower infection than across the Oresund bridge in Copenhagen.</p> <p>This chaotic mosaic of measures not only lacks any solid health justification \u2013 as repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/articles-detail/updated-who-recommendations-for-international-traffic-in-relation-to-covid-19-outbreak\">stated</a> by the WHO \u2013 but also contradicts what the European Union is about.</p> <p>EU citizens have the right to the same legal treatment across the union, free from any form of discrimination. So when France imposes mandatory quarantine on those arriving from Spain, but not from other countries, it is actually discriminating among EU citizens. This is equally true for Portugal whose borders are <a href=\"https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/news/portugal-to-help-emigrants-to-return-for-summer-vacations/\">selectively reopening</a> vis-a-vis \u201cthose countries with the greatest number of Portuguese\u201d. A similar discriminatory pattern also exists in Hungary which <a href=\"https://konzuliszolgalat.kormany.hu/information-on-hungarian-entry-requirements-due-to-covid-19-situation\">exempts</a> from its border controls the nationals of the Czech Republic, Poland, Germany, Austria, and Slovakia. Proposed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/what-is-the-future-for-travel-and-immigration-in-age-of-covid-19\">travel bubbles</a>, such as the Baltic bubble \u2013 allowing free travel between across the three Baltic countries also raise discriminatory concerns.</p> <p>Letting EU countries re-establish borders was wrong in the first place. Border controls \u2013 as well as selective quarantine regimes \u2013 reflect an artificial, misleading attempt at resorting to nationality as the dividing line between the healthy and unhealthy. The nation state is not the right geographical or administrative unit with which to counter a virus that is not only borderless, but also doesn\u2019t spread uniformly within any country\u2019s territory. That\u2019s why the EU <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/communication_freemovement.pdf\">recommended</a> lifting restrictions \u201cin areas with a comparable epidemiological situation\u201d \u2013 in other words regions, not countries.</p> <p>Ultimately the maintenance of border checks reveals an alarming lack of trust among EU countries, instigated by provisional data that lacks any comparability on how each of them handled the pandemic. Unwinding these different national measures will take some time and leave scars on \u201cpatient Europe\u201d. As such, they risk fuelling nationalist sentiments that were diluted by decades of European integration.</p> <p>As the summer approaches, the reopening of Schengen is driven more by the urge to let holidaymakers and tourists spend money than the need to ensure that EU citizens can pursue cross-border lives. But a border-free Europe is not the prerogative of tourists and interrail travellers. Free movement is an existential precondition for millions of citizens living, commuting, parenting and therefore regularly travelling between jurisdictions.</p> <p>The aim should not be the return to the status quo but to update and strengthen the travel-free zone to avoid it being suspended again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09d1d524b7297911a69ee1d01a0812da5e308402\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09d1d524b7297911a69ee1d01a0812da5e308402/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A German border police officers checks the documentation of a driver at a checkpoint at the German-French border.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A German border police officer checks the documentation of a driver at a checkpoint at the German-French border.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Niederm\u00fcller/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We Europeans were sold a dream.

  "<p><strong>Indonesia</strong> has reported its highest number of daily coronavirus cases as millions of people in the world\u2019s fourth most populous country prepared to mark the festival of Eid al-Fitr without the usual celebrations and gatherings.</p> <p>This year\u2019s festivities will be dampened by the economic hardship for many as Indonesian migrant workers, who usually send money back home to their families, have been left stranded and with no income.</p> <p>Indonesian president Joko Widodo has banned people travelling home to their families for the holiday, though thousands have reportedly made the journey this week, despite fears that this could prompt further rises in transmission.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/21/modi-the-fanatic-is-using-the-coronavirus-crisis-to-destroy-indias-heritage\">Modi the fanatic is using the coronavirus crisis to destroy India's heritage | Anish Kapoor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Officials said the virus has been spreading at its fastest rate over the past nine days, due in part to a worsening outbreak in East Java.</p> <p>On Thursday, the country reported 973 new infections, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 20,162. The authorities have asked the military and the police to prevent arrivals in Jakarta until a full reopening of the capital is permitted.</p> <p>As of Friday, 5,101,97 cases of coronavirus have been reported around the word, with the US recording the highest number of infections. There is growing concern about the outbreak in<strong> Brazil</strong>, which recorded its biggest daily death toll on Thursday, when 1,188 fatalities were reported. Brazil now has 310,087 recorded cases \u2013 seen as a likely underestimate given the lack of testing in the country \u2013 and has almost overtaken Russia to become the second worst-hit country behind the US.</p> <p>Across the world, many Muslim countries have said they will tighten restrictions this weekend for Eid, which marks the end of the holiest time in the Muslim calendar, the Ramadan month of fasting.</p> <p>In <strong>Lebanon</strong>, an economic crisis that was already causing huge hardship has worsened as a result of the pandemic and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/22/lebanon-cash-crisis-eid-nothing-to-celebrate\">left Muslims in despair as Eid begins</a>.</p> <p>\u201cEven during the civil war there was money and no one starved,\u201d said an unemployed public bus driver, Mohammad, in Beirut. \u201cNow it\u2019s just welfare.

New trips mean new Covid-19 infections,\u201d he said, quoted by the semi-official news agency ISNA.</p> <p>The health ministry announced 66 more deaths and another 2,392 cases of coronavirus infection across Iran, which has the Middle East\u2019s deadliest outbreak.</p> <p>For the most vulnerable, who have lost work and are stranded away from home, the holiday period will be especially challenging.

This year, however, many have seen their work cut as businesses have been forced to close.</p> <p>Wasito, who works as a plumber in <strong>Malaysia</strong>, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that he has not been paid his monthly wages of 2,500 ringgit ($575) during the six-week shutdown. Instead, he has been forced to borrow money from his employer just to eat.</p> <p>\u201cI did not dare to ask why I wasn\u2019t paid because I don\u2019t want to be fired, and I\u2019m too embarrassed to borrow money again for Eid,\u201d he said. \u201cMy wife has been calling every day and crying.

There are so many wonderful things about the series - especially the escapism it provides at this time - but I think my favourite is the space in which the natural sounds are allowed to exist in.</p> <p>Harrison\u2019s wonderfully childish excitement is lovely to hear - as are her well-informed and often philosophical pontifications - but the real beauty is in the moments in-between. It\u2019s something I often find lacking in audio these days: the importance of nothing - the brief silence between the musical notes and the slight hesitation before a word is heard. The Stubborn Light of Things captures those moments in a way that embodies the open expanse Melissa is taking us through.
