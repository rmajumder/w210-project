Iata\u2019s director general, Alexandre de Juniac, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The industry\u2019s outlook grows darker by the day.

Allowing them an exemption would weaken any debt-relief initiative. Providing aid through the World Bank and other donors while allowing commercial debt payments to absorb a large share of the transfer would be the financial equivalent of pouring water into a bucket with large holes. To put the figures in context, commercial debt repayments would be equivalent to over half of the emergency Covid-19 financing being prepared by the World Bank for delivery through IDA.</p> \n   <p>... Official creditors should make it clear that they expect commercial creditors to apply comparable treatment. There are precedents which, if not directly applicable, could serve as a guide. These include the \u2018Vienna Initiative\u2019 through which European governments coordinated the response to the 2009 financial crisis. If necessary, governments should encourage participation by making access to special Covid-19 financing programmes conditional on commercial creditors participating in the debt standstill. Faced with a global public health emergency that demands a global financial response, governments must deploy their regulatory powers and financial resources in the interest. The G20 should work with the IMF and World Bank to convene a commercial creditors summit to agree terms for creditor participation in debt repayment suspension.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/commercial-creditors-must-sign-up-to-global-debt-deal-or-forgo-covid-19-help\">Commercial creditors 'must sign up to global debt deal' - or forgo Covid-19 help</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-14T16:57:16.441Z\">at 5.57pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e95e3c18f082a2cd32a6aa3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-14T16:38:41.425Z\">5.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The coronavirus lockdown in <strong>Uganda</strong> has been extended for another three weeks, with the president, Yoweri Museveni, calling on people to be disciplined to avoid spreading infection. </p> \n  <p>In a lengthy address to the nation on Tuesday, Museveni reaffirmed Uganda\u2019s 35 restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus, adding that judging by the comparatively low number of infections in the country - 54 confirmed cases as of Monday - they seemed to have worked.

The strictest measures implemented so far have been gatherings of more than 50 people and a ban on visits to nursing homes.</p> \n  <p>But its soft approach has drawn criticism. On Tuesday Sweden\u2019s public health agency said it had recorded a total of 11,445 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 1,033 deaths. Neighbouring Finland, which has about half the population of Sweden, had as of Tuesday reported 64 deaths, and has closed down restaurants and schools.</p> \n  <p>In an open letter, a group of 22 doctors, virologists and researchers from Sweden\u2019s top hospitals, universities and research institutes pointed write:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>One would like to imagine that Sweden has also had a forward-looking strategy, especially as our country has always had a different way of dealing with the spread of infection than the rest of the world. One would like to imagine that our authorities have prepared well since the epidemic broke out in China, and especially since it was clear that the problem was likely to be global.</p> \n   <p>\u2026 If there was a well-thought-out, well-functioning strategy for Swedish infection prevention work with Covid-19, Sweden would hardly have the same death toll as Italy today, and 10 times higher than Finland\u2019s. If there had been a well-developed, well-functioning strategy, half of Stockholm\u2019s elderly residents would not have been affected by the epidemic - and in some cases over 20% of the healthcare staff would be antibody positive.</p> \n   <p>\u2026 The approach must be changed radically and quickly. As the disease-free virus spreads, it is necessary to increase social distance. Close schools and restaurants in the same way you do in Finland. Everyone who works with the elderly must wear adequate protective equipment. Prior to mass testing of infectiousness on all caring staff and testing for antibodies to sars-covid-2 so that established immune personnel can return to work.

He appealed to Germans to continue following the hygiene regulations as well as keeping their distance, saying these remained the two most crucial ways to dampen the virus\u2019 spread.</p> \n  <p>He added that in Germany the average age of those infected was 49, and a cough, temperature, blocked nose and loss of taste and smell remained the most commonly reported symptoms. In 2% of cases people developed pneumonia he said, while 16% of cases ended up in hospital.</p> \n  <p>On Monday, the Academy of Sciences, Leopoldina released a long-awaited study in which it recommended a staggered return to normal life starting with schools reopening.

system</h2> \n  <p>In the third week of March, while most of our minds were fixed on surging coronavirus death rates and the apocalyptic scenes in hospital wards, global financial markets came as close to a collapse as they have since September 2008. The price of shares in the world\u2019s major corporations plunged. The value of the dollar surged against every currency in the world, squeezing debtors everywhere from Indonesia to Mexico. Trillion-dollar markets for government debt, the basic foundation of the financial system, lurched up and down in terror-stricken cycles.</p> \n  <p>On the terminal screens, interest rates danced. Traders hunched over improvised home workstations \u2013 known in the new slang of March 2020 as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-18/global-traders-creating-the-ultimate-work-from-home-rona-rigs\">Rona rigs</a>\u201d \u2013 screaming with frustration as sluggish home wifi systems dragged behind the movement of the markets. At the low point on 23 March, $26tn had been <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2020/03/22/goodbye-dow-30000-hello-dow-10000/#559a9620ff50\">wiped off</a> the value of global equity markets, inflicting huge losses both on the fortunate few who own shares, and on the collective pools of savings held by pension and insurance funds.</p> \n  <p>What the markets were reacting to was an unthinkable turn of events. After a fatal period of hesitation, governments around the world were ordering comprehensive lockdowns to contain a lethal pandemic. Built for growth, the global economic machine was being brought to a screeching halt. In 2020, for the first time since the second world war, production around the world will contract. </p> \n  <p>It is now clear that we can, if circumstances demand, turn the economy off. But the consequences are catastrophic. </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/how-coronavirus-almost-brought-down-the-global-financial-system\">How coronavirus almost brought down the global financial system</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e95475c8f08db3109f21f15\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/helen-davidson\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-14T05:18:50.139Z\">6.18am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <h2>Global Covid-19 cases near 2 million as Putin warns Russia faces \u2018extraordinary\u2019 crisis</h2> \n  <p>The number of Covid-19 cases recorded worldwide is nearing 2 million, as Vladimir Putin warned warned officials to brace for \u201ccomplex and extraordinary\u201d scenarios in Russia as a result of the outbreak.</p> \n  <p>The country reported 2,558 new cases on Monday, its highest daily figure yet, as officials tightened lockdown restrictions in Moscow.

We will die,\u201d says another man. \u201cThe Malta military ship number is P52.\u201d</p> <p>The migrants, who were allegedly boarded by the Maltese navy roughly 20 miles south-west of Malta, were eventually rescued by the Maltese authorities.</p> <p>The Guardian has asked the Maltese navy for comment but the officials have did not respond.</p> <p>Since the beginning of the coronavirus emergency, the central Mediterranean route has become increasingly impenetrable for people fleeing war-afflicted Libya.</p> <p>The risk, according to charitable organisations, is that the restrictive measures in Italy and Malta will set the migrant situation back years, to when boats from Libya would set off on their own, risking people\u2019s lives in the attempt to reach Italian shores.</p> <p>\u201cEuropean governments\u2019 actions to close their ports to people rescued at sea put lives at risk and cannot be justified on public health grounds,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/judith-sunderland\">Judith Sunderland</a>, associate Europe and central Asia director at Human Rights Watch.</p> <p>\u201cRecent and unfolding events in the Mediterranean Sea raise serious concerns that <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/europe/central-asia/european-union\">European Union</a> countries will use the Covid-19 pandemic as an excuse to evade their responsibilities under international law to respond to boats in distress at sea.\u201d</p> <p>On Friday, Italian authorities said a 15-year-old who had landed on the Italian island of Lampedusa on Tuesday had tested positive for Covid-19 and been placed under quarantine.</p> <p>The rescue boat Alan Kurdi, operated by the German NGO Sea Eye and named after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/01/alan-kurdi-khaled-hosseini-mediterranean-refugees-sea-prayer\">three-year-old Syrian boy who drowned in 2015</a>, is currently the only NGO rescue boat operating in the central Mediterranean.</p> <p>The coronavirus outbreak has forced many charities to concentrate their aid efforts elsewhere, while other rescue groups, such as Sea Watch and SOS M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e, have not returned to international waters after being quarantined for 14 days after their last missions at the end of February.</p> <p>In a sign of how dangerous Libya is for those trying to reach Europe, dozens of people held at Tripoli\u2019s main port since Thursday fled the facility as it was being shelled early on Friday morning.</p>",

Of course being able to announce almost limitless government spending does help a lot, but he is less evasive than most of his colleagues and generally does a better job than the rest of them at sounding positive yet not deluded.</p> \n  <p>He managed it again today, even though some of his assumptions are verging on the heroic. The OBR does broadly back his claim that the economy will be able to recover quickly. But his suggestion that Boris Johnson\u2019s open-chequebook \u201clevelling up\u201d agenda will be able to survive intact after the national debt has risen much higher seems optimistic, to put it politely. And perhaps his boldest claim is that this is no inherent tension between safeguarding the economy and protecting lives. That argument might look robust now, but it is likely to appear more tenuous in the months to come.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Sunak insisted that the UK economy would be able to recover \u201cquickly and strongly\u201d after the coronavirus crisis was over. </strong>He made the claim in response to a report from the Office for Budget Responsibility suggesting a three-month lockdown, followed by three more months of partial lockdown measures, could shrink GDP by 35% and put unemployment up by more than 2m. Sunak insisted that this was not a firm forecast, but he accepted that the economic impact of the crisis would be significant. However, he claimed recovery could come very quickly. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This is going to be hard, our economy\u2019s going to take a significant hit and as I\u2019ve said before that\u2019s not an abstract thing, people are going to feel that in their jobs and in their household incomes ...</p> \n   <p>Yes it will be difficult in the short term. I\u2019m happy to be honest about that with people. I think the measures we\u2019ve put in place will help and then as we get through this it will mean that we can recover quickly and strongly and get our lives and economy back to normal.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Improbable as this claim may seem, it is in line with <a href=\"https://obr.uk/coronavirus-reference-scenario/\">the OBR analysis, </a>which envisages that says that \u201creal GDP falls 35% in the second quarter, but bounces back quickly\u201d.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Sunak rejected suggestions that the coronavirus crisis, and the enormous increase in government borrowing and debt that it will generate, would prevent the government from pursuing its \u201clevelling up\u201d agenda (which prioritises infrastructure spending, particularly in the north)</strong>. When this suggestion was put to him, he replied: </li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Once we get through this obviously we will have to take stock of public finances and the economy and make the right decisions at that point and I\u2019ve talked before about doing whatever we need to to right the ship at that point.</p> \n   <p>But what I would say is we remain very committed to the agenda that we set out before which was about levelling up and spreading opportunity around this country, and indeed I believe this can still be a critical part of how we get back to normal here.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He rejected claims that there was an inherent contradiction between protecting the economy and saving lives.</strong> In <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/chancellor-delivers-daily-coronavirus-update-14-april-2020\">his opening remarks</a> he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The third point I want to make is this: right now, the single most important thing we can do for the health of our economy is to protect the health of our people.</p> \n   <p>It\u2019s not a case of choosing between the economy and public health \u2013 common sense tells us that doing so would be self-defeating.</p> \n   <p>At a time when we are seeing hundreds of people dying every day from this terrible disease, the absolute priority must be to focus all of our resources \u2026</p> \n   <p>\u2026 not just of the state, but of businesses, and of all of you at home as well, in a collective national effort to beat this virus.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He refused to back a call for the government to scrap the pensions \u201ctriple lock\u201d as a result of the crisis, to free up money to help young workers who are particularly likely to be disadvantaged</strong>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/scrap-triple-lock-uk-pensions-coronavirus-crisis\">The Social Market Foundation, a centrist thinktank, has proposed this idea.</a> Asked if he agreed, Sunak said he would not write his budget now. But he said he wanted to provide opportunity for people, whatever age they were.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the government was working with the ONS to speed up the publication of information about the deaths of people with coronavirus in care homes.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that the coronavirus job retention scheme is due to open on 20 April.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said he would c</strong><strong>onsider making some of the coronavirus business loans 100% guaranteed by the government, not just 80% guaranteed. </strong>George Osborne, a former Tory chancellor, has proposed this idea.

Now they take place by conference call, just once a day, and they regularly last for more than an hour (like today\u2019s). They have also become a lot more useful, partly because of the length (it is not as if political journalists have a lot of other things to do), partly because of the format, but also partly because No 10 needs to engage with the media more than it thought it did in the pre-coronavirus era.</p> \n  <p>Most of the briefing was taken by the prime minister\u2019s spokesman, but we also heard from a Treasury spokesman talking about the OBR report.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The Treasury spokesman stressed that the OBR description of what might happen to the economy was not an official government prediction - although he did not challenge it in any significant way.</strong> He described the OBR analysis as \u201cone scenario\u201d, but he said that the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has already acknowledged that coronavirus was going to have a \u201csignificant impact\u201d on the economy. Sunak is chairing the government\u2019s daily coronavirus press conference at 5pm this afternoon.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The Treasury spokesman implied the OBR report vindicated government policy. </strong>He said the report confirmed that, if the government had not intervened, the economic impact on people would be \u201cmuch worse\u201d. And he said the OBR did say that the impact of the lockdown would be \u201ccontained in time\u201d and that there would be a rapid bounce back.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The Treasury spokesman said figures for how many workers were being furloughed under the government\u2019s job retention scheme would be available when the online portal was up and running at the end of April.</strong> The OBR estimates that around of 30% of employees will take advantage of this. <a href=\"https://obr.uk/coronavirus-reference-scenario/\">The OBR report</a> says:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have tried to estimate a cost that is consistent with the assumptions underpinning the economic scenario. Doing so implies that around 30 per cent of employees will be covered at a cost of \u00a342bn (equivalent to almost 15 per cent of total employee compensation in the baseline). We estimate that around a fifth of that returns to the Exchequer in income tax and NICs \u2013 an effect that is captured implicitly via the fiscal ready-reckoning rather than explicitly here. The first payments are expected this month.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The Treasury spokesman rejected claims that take-up was higher than the government expected. He said that the Treasury had never predicted what the take-up would be, and that a high take-up showed that the scheme was doing what it was meant to be doing.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said that the OBR\u2019s decision to model the impact of a three-month lockdown, followed by three months of partial lockdown (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-uk-live-news-lockdown-extended-peak-dominic-raab-boris-johnson-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e959a8d8f082c29014b0914#block-5e959a8d8f082c29014b0914\"> 12.16pm)</a>, should not be seen as an indication of what the government was planning.</strong> It was just a modelling assumption by the OBR, he said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The PM\u2019s spokesman rejected suggestions that the government was playing down the number of coronavirus deaths in care homes</strong>.

When it was put to him that the figures being given by care home providers suggested the official government figures for the number of care homes affected by coronavirus (13.5%) understated the scale of the problem, the spokesman said the government figure was the best available.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The PM\u2019s spokesman said the most recently daily figure for the overall number of tests carried out (in the 24 hours to 9am yesterday) was 14,506.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The PM\u2019s spokesman was unable to say whether the government would investigate every death of a social care worker with coronavirus.</strong> The government has said that the death of every NHS worker with coronavirus will be investigated.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The PM\u2019s spokesman said the scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) was meeting now to consider its evidence for government about the case of extending the lockdown.</strong> He said the government would be responding on Thursday. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The PM\u2019s spokesman said government advisers were reviewing policy on whether members of the public should wear masks. </strong>The group looking at this is \u201cNervtag\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/new-and-emerging-respiratory-virus-threats-advisory-group\">the new and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group,</a> the spokesman said.

We understand that participating countries may begin to receive PPE two weeks after orders are placed. Deliveries will be subject to the same demand pressures as all other procurement currently taking place. Participating in this scheme would not have allowed us to do anything that we have not been able to do ourselves.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The PM\u2019s spokesman sidestepped questions about whether the government would hold a public inquiry into its handling of coronavirus</strong>. He said the government was focusing on tackling coronavirus. But he went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>As we progress through this pandemic, we are of course looking at any improvements that we can make and any lessons that we can learn.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The PM\u2019s spokesman would not endorse a statement from Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, about the government being too slow to ramp up testing.</strong> On ITV last night Vallance said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>At the beginning, Public Health England got off to a good start in terms of testing to try and make sure they caught people coming in to the country with it. I then think it\u2019s not scaled as fast as it needs to scale \u2014 and that\u2019s being done now. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked about this, the spokesman said the government was very clear about the need to scale up testing. </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The PM\u2019s spokesman said that Boris Johnson was still off work.</strong> He was not engaged in any government business, the spokesman said. He said there was nothing new to add about the condition of the PM, who is continuing his recovery at Chequers. He said the priority for the PM was for him to \u201crest and recover\u201d and that his medical team had advised him not to immediately return to work. The spokesman was unable to say whether the PM would be holding his usual weekly audience with the Queen (which currently takes place by telephone) this week.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The PM\u2019s spokesman said that the government would be saying more later this week about its plans for a partial \u201cvirtual parliament\u201d when MPs returns from their Easter recess next week.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said suppliers of personal protective equipment (PPE) should not be prioritising England over Scotland.</strong> He said it was being distributed \u201cevenly across the UK\u201d in a \u201cfour-nation approach\u201d. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Our PPE strategy is UK-wide, making sure that frontline workers in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all have the PPE they need to stay protected while taking care of patients.

It says GDP could fall by 35% in the second quarter of the year.</p> \n  <p>Here is an extract.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In addition to its impact on public health, the coronavirus outbreak will substantially raise public sector net borrowing and debt, primarily reflecting economic disruption. The government\u2019s policy response will also have substantial direct budgetary costs, but the measures should help limit the long-term damage to the economy and public finances \u2013 the costs of inaction would certainly have been higher ...</p> \n   <p>We do not attempt to predict how long the economic lockdown will last \u2013 that is a matter for the government, informed by medical advice. But, to illustrate some of the potential fiscal effects, we assume a three-month lockdown due to public health restrictions followed by another three-month period when they are partially lifted. For now, we assume no lasting economic hit.</p> \n   <p><strong>Real GDP</strong> falls 35% in the second quarter, but bounces back quickly. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Unemployment</strong> rises by more than 2 million to 10% in the second quarter, but then declines more slowly than GDP recovers. Policy measures support <strong tabindex=\"-1\">households and companies\u2019 finances</strong> through the shock.</p> \n   <p><strong>Public sector net borrowing</strong> increases by \u00a3218bn in 2020-21 relative to our March budget forecast (to reach \u00a3273 bn or 14% of GDP), before falling back close to forecast in the medium term.

The report says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The year-to-date analysis shows that, of deaths involving the coronavirus (Covid-19) up to week 14, 90.2% (3,716 deaths) occurred in hospital, with the remainder occurring in hospices (33 deaths), care homes (217 deaths) and private homes (136 deaths).</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The problem with these figures, of course, is that they are probably more than two weeks out of date. The cut-off date was 11 days ago. But the figures are also based on information from registered death certificates, and on average they take five days to process.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-14T10:22:56.078Z\">at 11.22am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9570168f081a236f192eaa\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/andrewsparrow\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-14T08:27:25.285Z\">9.27am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Coronavirus much more widespread in care homes than official figures suggests, says leading firm</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Good morning.

They calculated the potential benefits by including the social welfare aspects of cutting emissions and of economic growth, which gives more weight than some other models to developing countries with large populations of poor and vulnerable people. They found that better international cooperation on emission would lead to better outcomes for such people, who are likely to be worst affected by climate breakdown.</p> <p>However, their findings also show such a strategy has greater benefits for developing countries with high emissions, such as India, Indonesia, Nigeria and China, than for developed countries such as the US and the EU in the medium term, though all benefit in the longer term.</p> <p>Their findings come at a critical time for governments around the world grappling with the coronavirus crisis, and its dire economic impacts.

That gives governments more time to improve their national plans, called <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs\">nationally determined contributions</a> in the UN jargon, but so far there is little sign they are doing so. Only Japan and Chile, the host of last year\u2019s talks, among major countries have so far submitted fresh plans, and while Chile agreed to step up climate action, Japan\u2019s plan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/30/campaigners-attack-japan-shameful-climate-plans-release\">showed no improvement</a>.</p> <p>A UK government spokesperson for Cop26 told the Guardian: \u201cWe welcome Chile\u2019s climate leadership as Cop25 president in submitting a strengthened emissions reduction target, and hope to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/03/saving-the-planet-uk-role-vital-if-cop-26-climate-talks-to-succeed\">all countries following their lead</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Current climate plans showed that the rich world must do more, said Rachel Kennerley, climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth. \u201cBudgets should be rebalanced to provide emergency finance and help poorer nations \u2013 it\u2019s the fair and right thing to do. If we don\u2019t pay now, this is the kind of bill that, like a person ignoring a credit card statement, will only multiply in time. </p> <p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s the kind of expenditure that repays multiple benefits and should really be seen as a smart investment. As if stopping climate change isn\u2019t enough, it will deliver a better quality of life for more people around the world, faster.\u201d</p> <p>The economic benefits of curbing greenhouse gas emissions, compared with the high costs of reneging, should spur governments to act on the climate, according to the Nature study\u2019s authors. However, investments are needed to realise these gains, particularly from developed countries. The outlay would amount to between $5tn and $33tn for the US, and between $16tn and $105tn for the G20 countries as a whole.</p> <p>The study said: \u201cEarly and quick action will provide a better chance to close the widening emissions gap, even though a large amount of abatement cost would occur in the short term.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Since the coronavirus outbreak, cruise ships have transformed from (polarizing) sites of pleasure to floating dungeons where the extremely unlucky have been, or continue to be, confined. The Guardian recently reported that, as of last Friday, more than 6,300 people \u2013 crew and passengers alike \u2013 were still stranded on cruise ships.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/09/revealed-6000-passengers-on-cruise-ships-at-sea-despite-coronavirus-crisis\">Revealed: 6,000 passengers on cruise ships despite coronavirus crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Those stuck aboard are understandably <a href=\"https://www.cruiselawnews.com/2020/03/articles/disease/cruise-coronavirus-crisis-crew-members-on-the-ruby-princess-plea-for-help/\">frightened and uncertain</a>. The sick are unable to receive long-term care, and the threat of contagion is omnipresent. A wave of would-be vacationers who have returned to dry land are launching lawsuits against cruise companies; some <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/costa-cruise-lines-coronavirus-covid-19-luminosa-2020-4\">have accused</a> cruise operators of endangering passengers by covering up cases of coronavirus onboard. Indeed, cruise companies \u2013 despite claiming to have been blindsided by the speed and severity of the coronavirus outbreak \u2013 continued to launch voyages even after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic.</p> <p>Between cruise operators\u2019 disastrous pandemic response and the economic effects of the pandemic, the future of the cruise industry is uncertain. Cruise operators are no doubt wondering when \u2013 or if - passengers will return. But the better question is: <em>Should </em>passengers return?</p> <p>There are plenty of reasons for the answer to be no.</p> <p>For many tourists, cruises are the ideal vacation \u2013 a chance to see the world with limited hassle and unlimited buffets. But, as Covid-19 has emphasized, in addition to convenience and luxury, cruises also provide a golden opportunity to get sick. Even in the absence of a global pandemic, cruise ships are ideal incubators of infectious diseases.</p> <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/vsp/surv/gilist.htm\">investigate</a> about 13 outbreaks of gastrointestinal bugs like <em>E</em><em> coli</em> and <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/cruise-ship-nightmare-after-measles-norovirus-outbreaks-why-does-anyone-ncna1043516\">norovirus</a> aboard cruise ships a year; influenza and chickenpox are also fairly common.

Yes, you can get sick anywhere, but according to Tara C Smith, professor of epidemiology at Kent State University, cruise ships <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/cruise-ship-nightmare-after-measles-norovirus-outbreaks-why-does-anyone-ncna1043516\">genuinely amplify</a> the risk of infection \u2013 in part because of the close quarters onboard, and in part because passengers are at the mercy of companies\u2019 hygienic standards. In 2019, Carnival Cruises <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/carnival-fantasy-cruise-ship-receives-failing-sanitation-score-2019-8\">failed</a> sanitation inspections for offenses including \u201cbrown water\u201d discharge from showers in the medical center and unclean food service utensils. Moreover, when you fall ill on a cruise you are dependent on contractor physicians who charge high fees regular health insurance is unlikely to cover.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A passenger\u2019s carbon footprint triples in size when taking a cruise</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>After investigating air quality on cruises, the Johns Hopkins University professor Ryan David Kennedy <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/24/health/cruise-ship-air-quality-report/index.html\">told CNN</a> their onboard air pollution was \u201ccomparable to concentrations measured in polluted cities, including Beijing and Santiago\u201d. Yet the health risks posed by cruise ship emissions do not only affect their passengers. As Forbes <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesellsmoor/2019/04/26/cruise-ship-pollution-is-causing-serious-health-and-environmental-problems/#3c8bdbf337db\">reports</a>, a single cruise ship emits daily pollution equal to a <em>million</em> cars. A passenger\u2019s carbon footprint triples in size when taking a cruise. The Royal College of Physicians <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-39129270\">estimates</a> that the premature deaths of about 40,000 Britons every year are linked to air pollution, with the cruise and shipping industry being <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/air-pollution-uk-shipping-levels-record-environment-fumes-damage-nitrogen-dioxide-sulphur-a8189691.html\">major contributors</a>.</p> <p>Then, there\u2019s the fact that cruises expel enormous quantities of hideous discharge into the ocean. Cruises are <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/carnival-cruise-ships-dumped-sewage-waste-into-ocean-report-2019-4\">notorious</a> for covering up the fact that they illegally dump sewage, garbage and sulfurous fuel waste \u2013 sometimes even <a href=\"https://www.stand.earth/latest/markets-vs-climate/carnivals-cruise-pollution/46000-people-ask-national-park-service-suspend\">in the protected waters of national parks</a>.

Even massive fines \u2013 such as the $40m US Carnival was charged in 2016 for <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/tourism-cruises/article118245433.html\">illegally dumping oily water off the coast of England and trying to cover up the crime</a> \u2013 hardly matter when some cruise companies earn revenues of almost <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/carnival-corporation--plc-reports-fourth-quarter-and-record-full-year-earnings-300769295.html\">$19bn</a> annually, essentially tax-free. Cruise companies are able to <a href=\"https://www.cruiselawnews.com/2011/02/articles/taxes/no-taxes-the-cruise-lines-dirty-little-secret/\">exploit a loophole</a> to avoid most US taxes and labor regulations; three major companies make up <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/23/21187076/cruise-line-industry-bailout-trump-coronavirus-us-companies-tax\">70%</a> of the global cruise market, all of which are incorporated in countries with tax and labor laws very different from those of the US.</p> <p>Yes, many people who work on cruises are currently losing their jobs, and that is rightly sad. But bear in mind that the cruise industry\u2019s economic model is built around hiring people from poor countries whose economic prospects are so bad they are willing to endure exploitation and mistreatment. Despite the industry\u2019s massive profits, cruises pay employees as little as <a href=\"https://www.cruisecritic.com/articles.cfm?ID=261\">$600 a month</a>.</p> <p>Additionally, cruises further the misguided notion that vacationers should be entitled to travel anywhere, no matter how culturally and ecologically sensitive. Case in point: as sea ice dwindles, the Arctic has emerged as a <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/cruises/articles/the-best-arctic-and-antarctic-cruises/\">chic destination</a>, allowing cruise passengers to observe the effects of climate change while actively contributing to it.</p> <p>It\u2019s comforting to believe that our vacations benefit local communities \u2013 but that\u2019s not always true, especially in the case of cruise tourism. Residents of Nunavut, Canada, <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-complicated-relationship-between-cruise-ships-and-the-arctic-inuit\">have expressed</a> concerns that cruise ships disrupt wildlife and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/04/arctic-cruise-boom-canada-inuit-indigenous-communities\">threaten</a> their culture. Investigations have also found that the sunny economic impact figures provided by the cruise industry may <a href=\"https://thewalrus.ca/cruise-ships-often-represent-the-worst-of-capitalism/\">overstate the revenue</a> their business actually brings to local communities.</p> <p>When cruise lines are able to sail again, they will do their best to lure customers back with <a href=\"https://www.cruzely.com/will-cruises-get-cheaper-signs-point-to-more-cruise-deals/\">cheaper prices</a>. Hopefully, the debacle of the cruise industry\u2019s botched pandemic response has shown consumers what industry watchdogs have known for decades: the cruise industry is an ethical disaster that shirks accountability at every turn.

Even today, Biden says he has \u201c<a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/joe-biden-says-millennials-dont-have-it-tough-780348\">no empathy</a>\u201d for young people who complain about indebtedness and precarity. He has told millennials who raise concerns about his environmental policies that they should \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3dqR9oQ9pE\">go vote for someone else</a>\u201d. Plenty have been willing to do just that. So while some commentators, such as Vox\u2019s Matthew Yglesias, have <a href=\"https://youtu.be/TmHFt13osiQ\">suggested</a> that activists and left media are responsible for Biden\u2019s \u201cunity problem\u201d, the more blameworthy culprit is Biden himself.</p> <p>In fact, it doesn\u2019t seem as if Biden has much interest in solving his \u201cunity problem\u201d. In an ostensible effort to reach out to the left, Biden recently <a href=\"https://www.democracynow.org/2020/4/10/headlines/joe_biden_calls_for_medicare_eligibility_age_to_be_lowered_from_65_to_60\">debuted new policies</a> on healthcare and education. Did he adopt the policies recommended in the activists\u2019 letter, namely Medicare for All and canceling all outstanding student debt? <a href=\"https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/joe-biden-outlines-new-steps-to-ease-economic-burden-on-working-people-e3e121037322\">No, he did not</a>. Instead, he merely proposed lowering the existing Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 60 and canceling tuition-related debt for students who attended public colleges who earn under a certain income.</p> <p>The first of these policies almost seems like a deliberate insult. Biden\u2019s response to those young people demanding a better health policy is to offer a policy that won\u2019t help any of them for decades. And to understand just how pitifully stingy this \u201cconcession\u201d is, remember that dozens of Democratic senators, including plenty of \u201cmoderates\u201d, have <a href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article211824324.html\">already</a> endorsed lowering the Medicare eligibility age to 55. You can find an op-ed in Forbes (not exactly the Democratic Socialists of America newsletter) <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/teresaghilarducci/2020/04/10/now-more-than-ever-is-time-to-lower-medicares-age-to-50/#6d26b0ee52be\">suggesting</a> 50 would be a better age. Bill Clinton <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/07/us/clinton-proposes-opening-medicare-to-those-55-to-65.html\">proposed 55</a> in 1998, and Hillary Clinton <a href=\"https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2016/07/12/clinton-health-care-plan\">advocated 55</a> in 2016. So Biden\u2019s big concession to the left is actually more conservative than a centrist Democratic proposal! It\u2019s not nothing, but it\u2019s about as close to nothing as a policy can get without literally being nothing, and it shows that Biden isn\u2019t serious about courting the left.</p> <p>Remember, too, that we\u2019re only talking about the <em>platform. </em>This is where negotiations <em>start. </em>By the time a proposal has gone through the political process, it inevitably gets watered down. Maybe, if we\u2019re lucky, we\u2019ll get the Medicare age dropped from 65 to 63 by the year 2030 or something. And even that prospect assumes that Biden is serious about fighting for his platform. At election time, politicians have an unfortunate habit of promising voters whatever they think voters want to hear. Needless to say, they don\u2019t always follow through, and you\u2019re often better off looking at their record than their rhetoric. From Biden\u2019s record, it\u2019s more plausible that he\u2019ll follow through on his <a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/03/09/all-you-need-know-biden-reportedly-weighing-billionaires-michael-bloomberg-and-jamie\">reported plan</a> to put Michael Bloomberg and JPMorgan\u2019s CEO, Jamie Dimon, in his cabinet than that he\u2019ll overhaul the healthcare system.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Many progressives are going to have a difficult time voting for Biden</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The student debt plan is a disappointment, too. Why only public colleges, when so much unsustainable debt comes from private universities? Why only tuition-related expenses? Why is it means-tested? If Biden wants to impress the left, he will need a big, sweeping plan, not a plan with dozens of qualifiers and caveats that recalls Kamala Harris\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/kamala-harris-student-debt-proposal-confused-people-2019-7\">infamous proposal</a> to forgive debt only for \u201cPell grant recipients who start a business that operates for three years in disadvantaged communities\u201d.</p> <p>I actually really hope Biden embraces one of the big left policy proposals such as Medicare for All or the Green New Deal, because he can\u2019t afford to write off progressive votes, and the stakes of this election are high. If Donald Trump is re-elected, it will be a disaster: he will be emboldened and more powerful, and will end his second term with almost complete control of the courts. Democracy as we know it may disappear altogether; US militarism will escalate; carbon emissions will spiral out of control; and brutal new immigration policies will be introduced. Trump needs to lose, but Biden is <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/01/a-biden-nomination-means-a-second-trump-term\">already a weak candidate</a>, and he will be even weaker if he can\u2019t turn out the progressive base.</p> <p>Many progressives are going to have a difficult time voting for Biden. He has shown contempt for them and betrayed many of the causes they care about. To make matters worse, Tara Reade\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/04/evaluating-tara-reades-claims\">credible</a> sexual assault <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/us/politics/joe-biden-tara-reade-sexual-assault-complaint.html\">allegation</a> against Biden will make it difficult for those who consider themselves allies of women and supporters of #MeToo to vote for him in good conscience. Biden has a long way to go to convince the left he\u2019s worth supporting.</p> <p>So far, though, it seems as if Biden is mostly concerned with reassuring rich Democratic donors and party bigwigs that he will keep his promise that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2019/06/19/joe-biden-to-rich-donors-nothing-would-fundamentally-change-if-hes-elected/\">nothing would fundamentally change</a>\u201d. That could almost be Biden\u2019s campaign slogan at this point. But it doesn\u2019t seem like a winner. He will need to do better if he\u2019s going to stand a chance of beating Trump.</p> <ul> <li><p>Nathan Robinson is the founding editor of Current Affairs.

Despite promising signs the country is flattening the curve, the prime minister, Australians should expect restrictions to continue for many more weeks.<br></li> \n   <li>Tasmania recorded its sixth Covid-19 death, a 91-year-old woman at Mersey Hospital. The national toll is now 62.</li> \n   <li>A South Australian intensive care nurse at Royal Adelaide Hospital tested positive for Covid-19.</li> \n   <li>Virgin Australia put its shares into a trading halt as it looks for financial assistance to keep going and considers \u201crestructuring alternatives\u201d due to the coronavirus crisis.

Now in my dealings with the states and territories on vocational education, there has been a strong willingness to deal with these issues because we understand we\u2019ve got significant skills shortages that we have to start addressing.

  "<p>When Nish Kumar\u2019s political comedy show <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/b08yxh4h/the-mash-report\">The Mash Report</a> returned to our TV screens earlier this month, things looked very different to the last series \u2013 and not just because he\u2019d accidentally shaved his beard off. With the UK\u2019s Covid-19 lockdown in place, Kumar hosted the show from his spare room, forcing him to grapple with a professional camera and lighting on his own.</p> <p>Writing the show had been challenging, too. He knew that viewers who were isolated from loved ones needed a laugh. But making jokes while respecting the gravity of the situation is a tricky balancing act. In the end, Kumar decided to not to hold back: \u201cThis whole situation is a weird combination of boring and terrifying, like an epidemiology lecture delivered by Freddy Krueger \u2013 or Dominic Raab being, well, Dominic Raab,\u201d he announced. Meanwhile, co-star Rachel Parris tackled self-appointed coronavirus experts, including \u201ctesticle with teeth\u201d, JD Wetherspoon boss Tim Martin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4acbce870f7a81219ce190299e27ac0e4a808c6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4acbce870f7a81219ce190299e27ac0e4a808c6d/0_1218_4912_6142/800.jpg\" alt=\"Doesn\u2019t shy away from tough topics \u2026 Rachel Parris.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Doesn\u2019t shy away from difficult material \u2026 Rachel Parris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Mash Report \u2013 and Kumar and Parris\u2019s segments in particular \u2013 has never shied away from tough topics. In past series, Kumar has taken on the rise of the far right, Conservative immigration policies and climate change, somehow making them all funny.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s obviously not providing people with a full escape,\u201d he says. \u201cThe last few years have been very frenetic. We\u2019ve tried to take those news stories and make them into something that is entertaining, funny and gives people some catharsis, but also doesn\u2019t denigrate the seriousness of the issues.\u201d</p> <p>Kumar has been creating political comedy for around a decade. During that time, multiple Conservative governments, Brexit and Trump have provided fuel for his best material, causing his profile to rise as he became host of the BBC\u2019s topical radio comedy Newsjack, before taking the lead on The Mash Report.</p> <p>His personal politics are on the left: \u201cI\u2019d hoped, after the financial crisis in 2008, that we would look at the systemic failures that had allowed the crash to happen and rebalance our economy. I\u2019m sad that anger has been directed towards groups of people who are entirely blameless \u2013 people on benefits, people from minority groups. These are not the enemies.\u201d</p> <p>That sense of injustice fuels Kumar\u2019s best work, when, as he puts it, \u201cyou believe in the idea that you\u2019re writing the joke about.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s clearly easier, then, to write impassioned comedy when objectionable politicians and policies provide your punchlines: Nigel Farage\u2019s xenophobia, Theresa May\u2019s hostile environment, Donald Trump\u2019s everything. If things were different \u2013 a socialist government, fully funded public services, impeccable leaders \u2013 would the material dry up?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Prior to 2016, you had to convince people that politics was something they wanted to hear about</p> <footer> <cite>Nish Kumar</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI would much rather work a bit harder,\u201d Kumar laughs. \u201cI would rather be writing jokes in a less volatile political climate, still committed to ideals, but without the world burning.

That comes through strongly in her standup. It\u2019s there in Newsjack, too, but across the show, which has other writers and receives submissions from the public, there\u2019s a drive to satirise each end of the political spectrum. \u201cIt\u2019s not a party political broadcast for anyone,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s been a big journey for me \u2013 you can\u2019t just say: \u2018These are the bad guys\u2019.

It\u2019s a really hard balance to strike, but it\u2019s also part of making a good show.\u201d</p> <p>Over on The Mash Report, Kumar has freedom to broadcast his opinions. \u201cWe wanted to do something that had a point of view.

His 2019 Edinburgh show I, Tom Mayhew was a takedown of austerity, based on his own experience of the benefits system and the way claimants are treated. His next show looks at so-called low-skilled jobs \u2013 how they\u2019re integral to our society (as proven by the current crisis) and bring joy and worth to many workers, despite the fact they\u2019re not well-paid.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re passionate about something, it makes it easier to write comedy about it,\u201d he says. \u201cEven if it\u2019s tough, you\u2019ll find a way to write something funny because you want to express these thoughts and feelings.\u201d</p> <p>If we did end up in a socialist utopia, Mayhew admits that his onstage persona would become cheerier. \u201cBut even if the political landscape changed there will always be people to be held accountable, and there\u2019ll always be perceptions that will need challenging.\u201d</p> <p>Like Kumar\u2019s material about climate change or Pritchard-McLean on misogyny, Mayhew\u2019s comedy doesn\u2019t shy away from heavy topics. Yet he\u2019s conscious that audiences don\u2019t want to be preached to. \u201cI want my comedy to be funny first, but meaningful a close second,\u201d he says. \u201cEven if it doesn\u2019t change people\u2019s minds, they\u2019ll hopefully be a bit more understanding of a viewpoint that isn\u2019t theirs.

According to the <a href=\"https://kareningalasmith.com/counting-dead-women/\">Counting Dead Women campaign</a>, since lockdown on 23 March at least 10 women and children have been killed by men they knew. Six more killings of women by men in that period are yet to be confirmed as domestic homicides. As well as domestic homicides, Dwyer warns that \u201cwhat we\u2019re also going to see is an increase in suicides \u2013 people who really want to flee but can\u2019t and feel they have no other choice\u201d.</p> \n<p>Solace\u2019s 23 refuges across the capital are now completely full, and because nobody can move on from the 159 spaces, none of its 45 self-contained units are coming free.</p> \n<p>So will the extra \u00a32m from the government be enough? \u201cFor any individual charity focusing on violence against women and girls, that amount would be huge because we run things on a shoestring,\u201d Dwyer replies. \u201cSpread across the whole country, it\u2019s pitiful.\u201d</p> \n<p>She thinks the money will mainly be spent on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/09/uk-domestic-abuse-helplines-report-surge-in-calls-during-lockdown\">national domestic abuse helpline</a>, which refers women on to organisations like Solace to provide a roof over victims\u2019 heads. \u201cRegarding accommodation, we\u2019ve sent numerous letters to various secretaries of state, including Priti Patel, and had no response to any of them,\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe welcome the inclusion of tackling perpetrators in her announcement, suggesting that they should be the ones to leave, and would like to see how the home secretary plans to put this into practice. In the meantime, we are still funding accommodation from our emergency appeal for those women and children who have managed to flee.\u201d</p> \n<p>Since the lockdown began, Solace has had to pay for emergency accommodation for 10 women who have fled their homes, including a heavily pregnant Muslim woman with three children who was turned away for help by a council housing department. </p> \n<p>It wouldn\u2019t step in because the government advice has been that nobody should move \u2013 so housing officers are interpreting that as everyone should go home, Dwyer explains. \u201cIt\u2019s a madness, and it\u2019s really terrifying us that we are still seeing people turned away at this time.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a69d5c0b-bac3-4d08-9162-6d08a24a974e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/69XVUWvb3fM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>All her organisation\u2019s face-to-face support to help traumatised victims make safety plans, or organise the best way to flee, has had to go online.

The charity, which has an annual income of just under \u00a312m, is burning through money it has not budgeted for.</p> \n<p>Solace and the Public Interest Law Centre <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/31/call-for-uk-domestic-violence-refuges-to-get-coronavirus-funding\">wrote a letter </a>last month asking the government to provide emergency funding for domestic abuse organisations during the pandemic. \u201cRight now, we need money. If we don\u2019t get that funding, more people will die,\u201d she says. </p> \n<p> Dwyer is trying to anticipate the level of funding needed both now but also after the crisis, when she expects services to be inundated.</p> \n<p>\u201cEven in the healthiest relationship, being cooped up is extra pressure. We\u2019ve now got a situation where perpetrators may never have worked from home and end up becoming even more abusive. Then if you\u2019ve got someone using it as an opportunity to further isolate you, saying \u2018we need to self-isolate, we can\u2019t go out\u2019 \u2013 well, it\u2019s really difficult. And we don\u2019t know how long this will go on for.\u201d Victims only have bad options, she points out. \u201cEither you leave and become homeless, or you end up sleeping somewhere really unsafe, or you stay at home and risk your life.\u201d</p> \n<p>And as the risks soar for victims, so too does the pressure on staff at domestic abuse charities. They are now cleaning refuges daily but have not been able to access <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/nhs-staff-protection-doctor-ppe-coronavirus\">personal protective equipment</a> (PPE), despite a number of suspected Covid-19 cases.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhole houses have had to self-isolate, but they have not been tested, despite some people being very unwell,\u201d says Dwyer. Solace is now having to deliver food to its refuges that are in complete lockdown, and there have also been suspected Covid-19 cases among employees which, she explains, has had an impact on staffing levels and heightened the anxiety of the workforce. \u201cWe have developed a redeployment list so that staff from other services are supporting each other,\u201d says Dwyer. \u201cAll senior managers have also volunteered themselves for the list.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cYes I\u2019m really stressed, because it\u2019s stressful,\u201d she adds. \u201cWe have amazingly resilient staff and working through it all together has been great, but what we want is to be able to continue to support our services. That\u2019s the biggest thing. My concern as well is for the wider sector, because we know the smaller specialist organisations will be completely drowning at the moment.\u201d</p> \n<p>Of course it doesn\u2019t help that domestic violence services have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/23/council-funding-womens-refuges-cut-since-2010-england-wales-scotland\">slashed since 2010 </a>. </p> \n<p>Although the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/08/theresa-may-domestic-violence-bill-women\">domestic violence bill</a> introduced by Theresa May\u2019s government is seen as a big step forward, it looks unlikely to be passed any time soon \u2013 and none of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/housing-secretary-confirms-new-support-for-survivors-of-domestic-violence\">\u00a316.6m pledged by the government </a>earlier this year to help fund domestic abuse refuges has yet reached those providing services. <strong> </strong> And while Dwyer welcomes the creation of the first domestic violence commissioner, Nicole Jacobs, she says on its own it\u2019s not enough.</p> \n<p>She insists that the government and society need to take domestic abuse more seriously. \u201cIt\u2019s become normalised for a lot of people, it\u2019s become seen as inevitable,\u201d says Dwyer. \u201cBut it\u2019s not.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Curriculum </strong>vita<strong>e</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Age</strong> 40</p> \n<p><strong>Lives</strong> North London</p> \n<p><strong>Family</strong> Partner </p> \n<p><strong>Education</strong> St Gerard\u2019s school, Bray, Co Wicklow; Trinity College Dublin (Spanish, economics and Portuguese BA); University College Dublin (MSc, international development education); University of London, UCL and Queen Mary (LLM, public international law, and higher diploma, human rights law); Cranfield University (studying for MBA)</p> \n<p><strong>Career</strong> 2019-present: chief executive, Solace Women\u2019s Aid; 2016-19: strategic lead for violence against women and girls, Haringey council; 2012-16: violence against women and girls strategy manager, Tower Hamlets council; 2008-12: national children and young people manager, Women\u2019s Aid Federation of England;<strong> </strong>2007-08: programme manager, All Ireland Programme for Immigrant Parents, Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (ISPCC); 2002-07: various roles across international development and human rights, focusing on human rights defenders, rights of women and the rights of children, in Mexico, Peru, Switzerland and Dublin.</p> \n<p><strong>Interests</strong> Brewing, cooking, travel and social justice.</p> \n<p><br>24hr National Domestic Violence Helpline: 0808 2000 247</p> \n<p>Solace Advice helpline: 0808 802 5565 (London).

  "<p>In the third week of March, while most of our minds were fixed on surging coronavirus death rates and the apocalyptic scenes in hospital wards, global financial markets came as close to a collapse as they have since September 2008. The price of shares in the world\u2019s major corporations plunged. The value of the dollar surged against every currency in the world, squeezing debtors everywhere from Indonesia to Mexico. Trillion-dollar markets for government debt, the basic foundation of the financial system, lurched up and down in terror-stricken cycles.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/04/coronavirus-global-financial-collapse-prevented-podcast\">How coronavirus almost brought down the global financial system \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On the terminal screens, interest rates danced. Traders hunched over improvised home workstations \u2013 known in the new slang of March 2020 as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-18/global-traders-creating-the-ultimate-work-from-home-rona-rigs\" title=\"\">Rona rigs</a>\u201d \u2013 screaming with frustration as sluggish home wifi systems dragged behind the movement of the markets. At the low point on 23 March, $26tn had been <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2020/03/22/goodbye-dow-30000-hello-dow-10000/#559a9620ff50\" title=\"\">wiped off</a> the value of global equity markets, inflicting huge losses both on the fortunate few who own shares, and on the collective pools of savings held by pension and insurance funds.</p> <p>What the markets were reacting to was an unthinkable turn of events. After a fatal period of hesitation, governments around the world were ordering comprehensive lockdowns to contain a lethal pandemic. Built for growth, the global economic machine was being brought to a screeching halt. In 2020, for the first time since the second world war, production around the world will contract. It is not only Europe and the US that have been shut down, but once-booming emerging market economies in Asia. Commodity exporters from Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa face collapsing markets.</p> <p>It is now clear that we can, if circumstances demand, turn the economy off. But the consequences are catastrophic. Across the world, hundreds of millions of people have been thrown out of work. From the street hawkers of Delhi to the personal trainers of LA, the service sector \u2013 by far the most important employer in the modern economy \u2013 has been poleaxed. Never before has the global economy suffered a shock of this scale all at once. In the US alone, at least 17 million people have lost their jobs in the last three weeks. A severe global recession is now inevitable.</p> <p>The crucial question is how much of the world economy will survive the lockdown, and this depends on the availability of credit. Business runs on credit. The bits of the economy that do continue to function \u2013 the warehouses, the mobile phone providers and internet firms \u2013 all need credit. Wage bills for those still working are financed through credit. Even greater is the need of those who are not working. If they can\u2019t get loans, bills will go unpaid, which spreads the pain. To survive the lockdown, millions of families and firms around the world are relying on grants and loans from the state. But tax revenues have collapsed, so states need credit, too. Across the world we are witnessing the largest surge in deficits and government debt since the second world war.</p> <p>But who do we borrow from? Banks, financial markets and money markets provide the financial fuel of the world economy. Normally, credit is sustained by the optimistic promise of growth. When that dissolves, you face a self-reinforcing cycle of collapsing confidence, contracting credit, unemployment and bankruptcy, which spreads a poison cloud of pessimism. Like an epidemic, if left uncontrolled, it will sweep all before it, destroying first the financially fragile and then much else besides. It is not for nothing that we speak of financial contagion.</p> <p>What began with the lockdown in Wuhan in January is more intense and more fast-moving than any recession we have seen before. In a matter of weeks we have been confronted with an economic outlook that is as grim as at any moment since the 1930s. But it could have been even worse. Imagine a situation in which, on top of the pain of the lockdown and the hellish scenes in hospital wards, we also face calls for austerity because the government cannot safely finance extra spending. Imagine that interest rates were surging, and the terms for credit cards, car loans and mortgages were suddenly getting stiffer. All of this may still happen. It is already happening to the weaker economies around the world. But for now at least, it has not happened in Europe and the US \u2013 even after the turbulence of March 2020, when the pandemic hit with full force.</p> <p>What Europe and the US have succeeded in doing is to flatten the curve of financial panic. They have maintained the all-important flow of credit. Without that, large parts of their economies would not be on life support \u2013 they would be stone dead. And our governments would be struggling with a financial crunch to boot. Maintaining the flow of credit has been the precondition for sustaining the lockdown. It is the precondition for a concerted public health response to the pandemic.</p> <p>During major crises, we are reminded of the fact that at the heart of the profit-driven, private financial economy is a public institution, the central bank. When financial markets are functioning normally, it remains in the background. But when they threaten to break down, it has the option of stepping forward to act as a lender of last resort. It can make loans, or it can buy assets from banks, funds or other businesses that are desperate for cash. Because it is the ultimate backer of the currency, its budget is unlimited. That means it can decide who sinks and who swims. We learned this in 2008. But 2020 has driven home the point as never before.</p> <p>The last six weeks have seen a bout of intervention without precedent. The results have been momentous. A giant public safety net has been stretched out across the financial system. We may never know what went on behind the closed doors of the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England during those critical moments in March. So far, only <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-09/some-ecb-officials-had-doubts-about-emergency-bond-purchases\" title=\"\">muffled sounds of argument</a> have reached the outside. But as the virus struck, the men and women in those three central banks held the economic survival of hundreds of millions of people and the fate of nations in their hands. This is the story of how global financial meltdown was averted by central banks taking decisions that, just a month earlier, they would have dismissed as utterly impossible.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The financial markets scan the world for risk. Even the slightest disruption in the vast networks of finance, production and trade offers the opportunity for profit or the threat of loss. So the news on 23 January, that the outbreak of an unknown virus was serious enough for the Chinese authorities to impose a gigantic quarantine, hit the traders on their Bloomberg terminals hard. Bank economists struggled to get a grip on the dimensions of the problem. Would this be a minor disruption like Sars in 2003? Or were we facing the nightmare scenario of the Hollywood film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/30/what-can-we-learn-about-coronavirus-from-watching-contagion\" title=\"\">Contagion</a>?</p> <p>In late January, investors began to move more and more money out of things like commodities and shares in companies, and into the relative safety of government bonds. What comforted them was the idea that the virus was a problem contained in China. The day that illusion burst \u2013 the day that investors realised that Covid-19 was becoming a global pandemic \u2013 was Monday 24 February. Over the weekend the Italian government had announced that it was imposing a quarantine in parts of northern Italy. It was the first place in the west to do so.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9a900558f352fc351fe1067ee4b65cb30b726ecc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a900558f352fc351fe1067ee4b65cb30b726ecc/0_0_5312_3541/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Around the time Italy imposed a national lockdown in early March, investors worldwide began to panic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Around the time Italy imposed a national lockdown in early March, investors worldwide began to panic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alessandro Serran\u00f2/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ever since the financial crisis of 2008, Italy\u2019s economy had been stagnating. Both its banks and its public finances were in a precarious state. Italy\u2019s debt levels were high enough to cause bond markets to periodically panic. Now the country would become the frontline in the virus fight. The coronavirus would test the solidarity of the eurozone at its weakest link.</p> <p>At this point, not everyone was taking the threat seriously. The caseload in the US still looked tiny. Donald Trump dismissed the virus as a \u201cscare\u201d. But investors were now seriously worried. Over the week that began on 24 February, America\u2019s main stock market index, the S&amp;P 500, lost 10% of its value. The chair of the US Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, was concerned enough to signal that he would soon be bringing forward a cut in interest rates, in order to stimulate consumption and investment. It was a conventional reaction, but Covid-19 was no longer looking like a conventional threat.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>By early March, whatever complacency had prevailed was long gone. The death toll in northern Italy was rising into the hundreds and it was only a matter of time before the government in Rome would be forced to declare a nationwide lockdown.</p> <p>Investors around the world started to panic. In times of uncertainty, they want safe-haven assets. What makes a government bond a safe investment is not only the financial standing of the borrower, but the depth of the market in which lenders can sell them if they want to get their money back sooner. There is no deeper market than that for US Treasuries, as US government bonds are known. The greater the demand for safety, the lower the interest rate the US government generally has to pay to borrow. In the first week of March, those rates were at record lows.</p> <p>For the rest of the world economy, this run to safety was an alarming signal. One sector that knew it was heading for trouble was oil. When the global economy slows, so does the demand for energy. The oil industry of the 21st century consists, on the one hand, of large, state-controlled producers \u2013 above all the Opec group dominated by Saudi Arabia and Russia \u2013 and, on the other hand, of the US\u2019s upstart fracking industry. To match falling demand for oil, the Saudis wanted to cut overall production and thus prop up the price. For this they needed the agreement of the other big producers, but Russia refused to go along with them. As Moscow saw it, cutting production with a view to propping up prices was an invitation to American shale producers to fill the gap. If the politics of climate change meant that the future really would bring a transition away from fossil fuel, winning the end game involved seizing as much of the market as possible for as long as oil was being pumped. So Russia decided not to cut production, but to launch a price war. Not wanting to be outdone, over the weekend of 7-8 March, Saudi Arabia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/saudi-arabia-oil-price-war-production-increase-aramco\" title=\"\">took up the challenge</a>. It announced that it would be maximising production and discounting its prices.</p> <p>On Monday 9 March, as markets opened, oil prices plummeted. The benchmark Brent crude fell 24% by the end of trading. By the end of the month its value had halved. From the point of view of the financial markets, the ferocity of the competition in the oil industry was a harbinger of things to come. Falling demand would force industry after industry to either slash prices or contract production. Either way, it was bad news for profits.</p> <p>When trading opened on Wall Street that morning, the situation was so dire that the circuit-breakers \u2013 automatic stops to trading that are triggered when prices fall by a certain amount \u2013 were soon activated. This was supposed to slow a wild selloff. But it sent a message of panic. As soon as trading resumed, everything sold.</p> <p>A rout like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/mar/09/markets-plunge-crash-financial-crisis-coronavirus-ftse-italy-oil-price-dow-business-live?page=with:block-5e663c6f8f085f0b8d944e59\" title=\"\">the one that began on 9 March</a> has a perverse logic. When fund managers face withdrawals from the people whose money they manage, they need cash and have to choose which assets to sell first. They might prefer to sell the riskiest investments, but those can be disposed of only for a large loss. So instead, they attempt to sell their most liquid and safe assets \u2013 government bonds. That means the prices of those bonds fall, dragging them into the maelstrom. This has the knock-on effect of unravelling a basic relationship on which many investors rely: typically, when shares go down, bonds go up, and vice versa. So to protect yourself against risk, you buy a portfolio made up of both. If everything works as it\u2019s supposed to, the swings should balance each other out. But in the panic that began on 9 March, this was no longer happening: rather than balancing out, the price of shares and bonds were collapsing together. The only thing that anyone wanted to hold was cash, and what they wanted most of all were dollars. The surging US dollar in turn spread the pressure worldwide to everyone who owed money in that currency.</p> <p>The Fed had desperately tried to halt the run. To signal its willingness to support the economy and ease the pressure on the world economy from the strong dollar, it had <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/emergency-rate-cuts-events-caused-past-fed-coronavirus-timeline-when-2020-3-1028964493#1-october-2008-lehman-falls1\" title=\"\">brought forward</a> an interest rate cut that had been expected for the middle of the month. But with the darkening horizon, lower interest rates did little to help. Who would borrow or invest under such circumstances? Confidence was broken. Just how badly would become clear over the following two weeks.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>It was a cruel twist of fate that Italy was the first European country struck by the virus. Italy has a sophisticated medical system; Lombardy, the region worst affected by the virus, is among the richest places in the world. The weakness lies in the country\u2019s public finances. To fight the crisis, Italy needed to be spending money on public health and to support the economy during the lockdown. But would the corset of the euro give it the leeway?</p> <p>The problem was that spending to meet the coronavirus crisis would raise Italy\u2019s public debts. The more indebted you are, the higher the price you pay to borrow. For a European government, that premium is measured by the difference, or \u201cspread\u201d, between your interest rate and that paid by Germany, the highest-ranked borrower in Europe. With its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/05/eu-could-fine-italy-3bn-for-breaking-spending-and-borrowing-rules\" title=\"\">pre-crisis debt</a> at just under 135% of GDP, Italy was perilously close to the point at which rising spreads would drive up its deficit and thus, in a vicious circle, make its debts less and less sustainable.</p> <p>To ensure that investors stay calm, it is the job of central banks to act as the buyer of last resort. But because Italy is a member of the eurozone, it no longer has an independent national central bank that can buy its debt. Its monetary policy is set by the European Central Bank, which is prohibited from directly buying a member country\u2019s newly issued debt. That left the Italians exposed. As the coronavirus crisis intensified in late February and investors became concerned by the prospect of greater state spending, the spread to German interest rates increased. If they rose too far, Italy would face not only a public health disaster but a financial crisis, too. What could Europe do to help?</p> <p>Italy already had reason to feel abandoned by its European partners: they had done little to help it tackle its chronic unemployment problem, or to take in the refugees arriving from north Africa. The coronavirus was a new test. The signs were not good: other member states were grudging in their reaction to Italy\u2019s appeals for help. But what really mattered, for the country\u2019s financial survival, was the stance taken by the ECB.</p> <p>Under its former president, Mario Draghi, the ECB had emerged in the course of the last financial crisis as the pivot of the European economy. Draghi\u2019s promise to do <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/26/eurozone-crisis-greece-bailout-barroso#block-501117ec95cb1d4f92af2233\" title=\"\">whatever it takes</a> to hold the eurozone together, uttered at the height of the crisis in July 2012, has become a mantra of modern economic policy. Faced with a financial panic, restoring confidence is key \u2013 and because a central bank is in charge of issuing currency, it is the only crisis-fighter with truly unlimited firepower.</p> <p>Northern European fiscal and monetary conservatives had always been suspicious of Draghi\u2019s interventions, which they saw as a way to transfer Italy\u2019s liabilities on to Europe\u2019s balance sheet. And his <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-ecb-policy/draghi-ties-lagardes-hands-with-promise-of-indefinite-stimulus-idUKKCN1VW2SR\" title=\"\">final round</a> of bond-buying, in 2019, proved particularly controversial. By the time he ended his stint at the ECB that autumn, it was all Angela Merkel\u2019s government in Berlin could do to ensure that there were no unseemly scenes at his retirement party.</p> <p>Christine Lagarde, the former finance minister of France and IMF boss, took over as head of the ECB in October 2019, and inherited Draghi\u2019s extraordinarily difficult position. Now she would have to demonstrate that she could handle a major financial crisis. The ECB press conference on 12 March was the crucial test.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1d392f4089b34020b6fcf7cf2f1e1c553ebcffba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d392f4089b34020b6fcf7cf2f1e1c553ebcffba/0_0_3500_2727/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christine Lagarde seen in a German TV broadcast of the ECB\u2019s coronavirus press conference on 12 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"779\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christine Lagarde seen in a German TV broadcast of the ECB\u2019s coronavirus press conference on 12 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ralph Orlowski/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The ECB had good news for Europe\u2019s banks: they would receive a huge amount of low-cost funding. It was also going to buy an additional \u20ac120bn in assets \u2013 although if that was spread across the members of the Eurozone, as the rules demanded, it would hardly give Italy the support it needed. But the critical moment came when Lagarde was asked a question about the ECB\u2019s attitude to sovereign debt. Her <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-04-06/coronavirus-lagarde-s-810-billion-u-turn-came-in-just-4-weeks?srnd=premium\" title=\"\">response</a> was remarkable. \u201cWe are not here to close spreads,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not the function or the mission of the ECB. There are other tools for that, and there are other actors to actually deal with those issues.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSpreads\u201d meant Italy. And what Lagarde seemed to be saying was that it was somebody else\u2019s problem. But if the ECB wasn\u2019t going to help Italy, who would? Did it really expect the other member states of the eurozone to string together a fiscal safety net for Italy? Obviously, given the bad blood between Italy and the northern Europeans, Lagarde had to walk a fine line. But with hundreds of people dying every day, with global financial markets in a state of repressed panic, was the ECB seriously suggesting that it would wait for Berlin, Paris and Rome to settle their differences before putting out the fire? It was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/ecb-announces-plan-to-help-eurozone-banks-withstand-coronavirus\" title=\"\">breathtaking</a>.</p> <p>For investors, Lagarde\u2019s comment came like a bolt of lightning. And within minutes, she started to backtrack. She went in front of the cameras to promise that the ECB would use the flexibility of its \u20ac120bn programme to prevent the fragmentation of the euro area \u2013 code for helping Italy. But the damage was done. The markets slumped, and the price that Italy had to pay to borrow leaped: averaged out, the spread moved by 0.65%. That may not sound like a big difference, but when applied to a mountain of debt the size of Italy\u2019s, it raises the interest bill by <a href=\"https://thegeneraltheorist.com/2020/03/15/loose-lips-cost-ships-lagardes-language-and-italys-eur14-billion-bill/\" title=\"\">as much as \u20ac14bn</a> for just one year. It was the last thing Italy needed. In a rare public rebuke, both Paris and Rome distanced themselves from the ECB. The crisis was pulling Europe further apart.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>After five terrifying days of market turmoil, the weekend of 14-15 March was a moment for central banks around the world to coordinate their response. What everyone wanted was dollars, so it was above all the Federal Reserve that needed to take the lead. And as its chair, Powell did. He called an unscheduled press conference for the afternoon of 15 March. What he announced was remarkable.</p> <p>With immediate effect, the Fed was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/15/federal-reserve-cuts-interest-rates-near-zero-prop-up-us-economy-coronavirus\" title=\"\">cutting interest rates to zero</a> \u2013 something it had done just once before, at the height of the crisis in 2008. To stabilise the US Treasury bonds market, it would be buying $700bn in a new round of so-called quantitative easing. And it would start big, buying $80bn by 17 March. In the space of just 48 hours, it would spend more on treasuries than the Fed spent in most months in the aftermath of 2008.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f17764cd536915f3b57efb88144f5c1a9dca6b32\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f17764cd536915f3b57efb88144f5c1a9dca6b32/0_0_6240_4160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The New York Stock Exchange on 16 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The New York Stock Exchange on 16 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These were measures for the US economy. But the coronavirus was a global problem. The flight to safety and the ensuing rise in the dollar had put pressure on everyone who had borrowed in the US currency. So, to ensure that dollars could be piped to every financial institution in every major financial centre in the world, the Fed announced that it was <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-swaps/fed-increases-frequency-of-swap-line-operations-with-other-major-central-banks-idUKKBN21726G\" title=\"\">improving the terms</a> on the so-called liquidity swap lines \u2013 deals by which the major central banks agree to exchange dollars for sterling, euros, swiss francs and yen in unlimited amounts.</p> <p>Powell was deploying the main weapons of the 2008 crisis with far greater speed than his predecessors ever had. But it was still not enough. When the markets opened the next day, 16 March, the fall was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/16/markets-hit-by-further-losses-despite-us-interest-rate-cut-willie-walsh-ba-coronavirus\" title=\"\">vertiginous</a>. The circuit-breakers are supposed to come into effect if the market falls by more than 7%. That morning, the fall was so quick that the S&amp;P 500 dropped by 8.1% before trading could be stopped. The so-called fear index, VIX \u2013 a measure of market volatility \u2013 surged to levels last seen in the dark days of November 2008.</p> <p>The fear in the markets was now feeding on itself. If the Fed\u2019s magic of 2008 no longer worked, then what would?</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The foreign exchange market, where currencies are traded, is the biggest market in the world. And the place where the most transactions are booked is the City of London. On an average day, transactions back and forth total $6.6tn. But on Wednesday 18 March, there was only one trade: people wanted to sell everything. The only thing they wanted to buy were dollars. Every other currency was falling.</p> <p>The central banks\u2019 failure to calm the markets had set the stage for the worst days of the panic. Coronavirus cases were piling up in Europe more rapidly than at the peak of the crisis in Wuhan. Hedge funds were placing multi-billion-dollar bets that the recession in Europe would be protracted. Blue chip companies like Apple were facing stiff premiums to borrow for as little as three months ahead. Even gold, a classic safe haven, was selling.</p> <p>That Wednesday, on his third day as governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey organised a press conference in an effort at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/mar/19/stock-markets-fall-ecb-coronavirus-stimulus-sterling-oil-prices-ftse-dollar-business-live?page=with:block-5e739e0d8f085c6327bc32ab#block-5e739e0d8f085c6327bc32ab\" title=\"\">reassurance</a>. But as he was speaking, sterling plunged by 5% to its lowest level since 1985. Meanwhile, the market for UK government bonds, also known as gilts \u2013 the oldest major asset market in the world \u2013 was witnessing unprecedented turmoil. It was, in Bailey\u2019s understated phrasing, \u201cbordering on the disorderly\u201d.</p> <p>In response, the Bank of England monetary policy committee met the next day in emergency session and announced that the Bank would be buying \u00a3200bn in gilts. Unlike in 2008, it would not be doing so on a prearranged schedule. As Bailey explained: \u201cWe will act in the markets promptly and rapidly as we see appropriate.\u201d This was no time for timetables. The central bank was, by its own admission, flying by the seat of its pants.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9a2f52d27f5e8cae8f0fcceaee2c9c1738dda8aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a2f52d27f5e8cae8f0fcceaee2c9c1738dda8aa/0_61_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On an emergency conference call on the evening of 18 March, the ECB executive board decided that it, too, needed to act. Under a <a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2020/html/ecb.pr200318_1~3949d6f266.en.html\" title=\"\">pandemic</a> <a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2020/html/ecb.pr200318_1~3949d6f266.en.html\" title=\"\">emergency</a> <a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2020/html/ecb.pr200318_1~3949d6f266.en.html\" title=\"\">purchase</a> <a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2020/html/ecb.pr200318_1~3949d6f266.en.html\" title=\"\">programme</a>, it announced that it would begin by buying \u20ac750bn of government and corporate debt. But the ECB was willing to go even further than that. It said that, if necessary, it would revise some of its \u201cself-imposed limits\u201d.</p> <p>For an institution as hidebound as the ECB, this amounted to a revolution. Self-imposed limits \u2013 inflation targets, rules on which European government\u2019s debt it could buy and in what quantities \u2013 are what the ECB lives by. It is clear that conservative members of the bank\u2019s governing council <a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/accounts/2020/html/ecb.mg200409_1~baf4b2ad06.en.html\" title=\"\">continued to resist such a move</a>. But in the end it was the turmoil in the markets that decided the issue. The ECB needed to send a signal of determination. If Lagarde had fluffed her \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d moment, the ECB was now at least promising to do whatever was necessary.</p> <p>By the end of the third week of March, 39 central banks around the world, from Mongolia to Trinidad, had lowered interest rates, eased banking regulations and set up special lending facilities. To ease the pressure on emerging markets, the Fed widened the network of liquidity swap lines to cover 14 major economies including Mexico, Brazil and South Korea. This was a remarkable wave of activism. But the pandemic itself was only beginning to bite. Central banks could cushion the financial shock, but not address the actual economic implosion, let alone the health crisis.</p> <p>European governments had been quick to move. Germany had thrown aside its fiscal caution and was committed to a <a href=\"https://www.thelocal.de/20200406/german-government-to-guarantee-100-percent-of-loans-to-smaller-firms-in-coronavirus-aid-package\" title=\"\">gigantic programme</a> of government guarantees for business lending. But this made all the more glaring the gap to Italy and Spain, which were not only hardest hit by the virus, but also constrained by the financial legacy of the eurozone crisis. They did not want to risk sliding back into a debt crisis.</p> <p>In the US, the Fed had leaped into action. But where were the politicians? Congress was distracted by the upcoming presidential election. What was needed was an unprecedented rescue package for an economy in freefall. How were Republicans and Democrats to reconcile fundamental differences over health care and unemployment insurance, or the notorious cronyism of the president and his clan? Since the Democrats had won control of the House of Representatives in 2018, legislation had been largely paralysed. Now, in the face of a tsunami of job losses, the two parties had to come to an agreement.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>As trading began in Asia early on the morning of Monday 23 March, the news from Washington made it clear that there had been no deal on Capitol Hill. The futures markets plunged so violently that circuit breakers were activated again \u2013 by now this had happened an unprecedented five times in two weeks. If it wanted to avoid a meltdown when Wall Street opened, the Fed would have to make another move.</p> <p>Until this point, Jerome Powell had been moving in the shadow of his predecessor, Ben Bernanke, who had been Fed chair in 2008. But by 23 March, Powell had activated all the basic elements of the 2008 repertoire \u2013 slashing interest rates, using quantitative easing, supporting money markets. But it had not worked, partly because it could not reach the source of the crisis itself \u2013 that is, the virus and the lockdown \u2013 and also because it was not reaching the bit of the credit system that was most vulnerable in 2020: the borrowing by big corporations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5bf09ffecba39cac687aba04e5611469e2d4e1e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bf09ffecba39cac687aba04e5611469e2d4e1e8/0_181_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Fed has always steered clear of corporate debt, which it considered politically sensitive. If you bought debt from individual firms, you were vulnerable to accusations of favouritism. If you bought a cross-section of debt you ended up holding many very poor-quality loans. But by the early hours of 23 March, it was clear that something had to be done to stabilise the corporate debt market. Since 2008, bonds issued by non-financial corporations have surged from $3.3tn to more than $6.5tn. If their value fell too far, US corporations would not only face shutdowns and a complete loss of revenue, but also a crippling credit squeeze.</p> <p>Ideally, the Fed would have made a grand announcement in conjunction with a Congressional stimulus package. But by the evening of 22 March, it was clear that the package being proposed by the Republicans was unacceptable to the Democrats. It might take days for them to square the difference. The financial markets would not wait.</p> <p>On 23 March, 90 minutes before markets opened, Powell made his move. He announced that the Fed was setting up legal entities \u2013 off the books of the Fed, but guaranteed by it \u2013 that would have the capacity to buy highly rated corporate debt, or at least any debt that the ratings agencies were still willing to declare investment-grade. In effect, the Fed was establishing itself as the backstop to the trillion-dollar corporate bond market. The Fed ramped up its asset-purchase programme, to an astonishing $375bn in Treasury securities and $250bn in mortgage securities in a single week.</p> <p>It was an extraordinary move to widen the scope of central bank intervention into the corporate economy. And it was understood as such by the markets. Since the start of the year, the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones, as well as the FTSE 100, had lost 30% of their value. That day, they began to recover.</p> <p>Two days later, on 25 March, backing arrived from Congress when the Senate passed its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/senate-passes-coronavirus-stimulus-package\" title=\"\">giant package of $2tn</a> \u2013 more than twice the size of the stimulus bill passed in 2009. It provided funds to top up unemployment insurance, to support small businesses and the US\u2019s privatised hospital system. Crucially, it also set aside $454bn to cover Fed losses. Since most loans would not be expected to go bad, this would enable the Fed to make more than $4tn in loans, if necessary.</p> <p>In the US, the public health campaign against the virus was still a shambles. But as far as economic policy was concerned, the full power of the American state was now being deployed behind the emergency programme. And the Fed was also acting as a provider of dollar liquidity to the world economy. In the UK, too, the Treasury and the Bank of England were working closely to link the huge increase in government spending to efforts to stabilise financial markets.</p> <p>But in the eurozone, that kind of coordination was lacking. The ECB had managed to stop the immediate panic. Yet there was still the question of whether the member states could come up with a financial plan to support their hardest-hit neighbours, Italy and Spain. The obvious solution was to issue debt jointly to fight the crisis together \u2013 an idea raised repeatedly during the eurozone crisis, when it had been bitterly resisted by a conservative northern European coalition led by Germany. This would ensure that Italy was not constrained by its pre-existing financial weakness.</p> <p>For a coalition of nine states led by France, Italy, Spain and Portugal, the case was obvious. On 25 March they called for a \u201ccommon debt instrument\u201d to fund a crisis response. The ECB threw itself energetically behind the proposal. But, once again, the Netherlands and Germany <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/apr/11/eu-coronavirus-relief-deal-enemies-debt-eurozone\" title=\"\">refused to budge</a>. The issue was shoved off into the Eurogroup, a meeting of the eurozone\u2019s finance ministers, where the outline of a deal did finally emerge two weeks later. By then the immediate panic had passed. As Lagarde and her central banking colleagues had feared from the outset, it was on their shoulders that the stability of the eurozone continued to rest.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Will the massive financial firewalls built by central banks on both sides of the Atlantic be enough to withstand the bad news that is headed our way over the coming weeks and months? It is too early to tell. But the first test came on Thursday 26 March, when the US Department of Labor announced that, in a single week, 3.3 million Americans had signed on for unemployment insurance. It was completely unprecedented. A graph stretching back half a century simply turns upwards in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/26/us-unemployment-rate-coronavirus-business\" title=\"\">vertical surge</a>. In the next two weeks, another 13.5 million people would be added to the insurance rolls. And there was no end in sight. America is on pace for national unemployment to reach 30% by the summer \u2013 greater than during the Great Depression of the 1930s.</p> <p>The shutdown spelled disaster for millions of American families, at least half of whom have no financial reserves to speak of, and for businesses up and down the land. How would the markets react? Astonishingly, they ended 26 March up 5%. The largest surge in unemployment ever recorded in history was met with a relaxed shrug.</p> <p>Why weren\u2019t investors more terrified? Because the scale of Congressional stimulus made clear that, no matter how divided American politics were, that wouldn\u2019t stand in the way of a huge surge of spending. And the Fed, for its part, would make sure that the huge flow of new debt was absorbed, if necessary on to its own accounts. The private credit system, the government budget and the balance sheet of the Fed were welded together in a closed loop.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>What the Fed, the Bank of England and the ECB managed to do in March was prevent the damage caused by the shutdown being made even worse by an immediate collapse of corporate credit. At the same time, by stabilising sovereign debt markets, they have enabled a huge surge in public spending to fight the crisis and cushion its social and economic side effects. To do this they have both widened the safety net to parts of the financial system never before protected, and intervened on a scale far greater even than in 2008.</p> <p>In the final days of March, the Federal Reserve was buying Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities at the rate of $83bn per day, or just shy of $1m per second. On 9 April, at the same moment as the latest horrifying unemployment numbers were released, it announced <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200409a.htm\" title=\"\">another $2.3</a><a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200409a.htm\" title=\"\">tn</a> in support targeted specifically at municipal debt and lower-grade corporate debt. That same day, the Bank of England adopted an even more radical approach. Rather than going through the process of having the Treasury issue debt that would then be bought by the central bank, it announced that it would be offering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/bank-of-england-to-finance-uk-government-covid-19-crisis-spending\" title=\"\">direct monetary finance</a> to the government, to provide it with whatever funding it needed. This would be temporary, but it was still a radical move. The government\u2019s current account at the Bank of England would be repurposed to allow, if necessary, tens of billions of pounds in coronavirus spending. The last time the British government resorted to this mechanism was at the height of the crisis in 2008.</p> <p>What we have seen in the financial system, over the past few weeks, is a victory of sorts \u2013 but it is a defensive one. Once again, we are propping up a fragile, profit-driven system to avoid something even worse. It is also a victory limited in scope.</p> <p>By flattening the curve of financial panic, the central banks of advanced economies have managed to ensure that life under the lockdown is not made even more unbearable by the shutting off of credit to business and households. They have also ensured that the public health response to Covid-19 can proceed at any scale that is required. Within Europe, there are questions about the differences between eurozone members: Germany has been able to deliver a conspicuously larger fiscal response to the crisis than have Italy or Spain. But those inequalities pale next to the problems facing much of the rest of the world. There the crucial supply of credit is being cut off even before coronavirus cases begin to mount, meaning, once again we have confirmed that the global financial system is hierarchical. At the apex stands the US Federal Reserve. The ECB, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England and their advanced-economy counterparts all enjoy the Fed\u2019s direct support. Thanks in no small part to that support, the advanced-economy central banks enjoy great latitude in propping up their credit systems. They might face moderate movements in their currency\u2019s exchange rate, but no devastating financial squeeze.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/how-will-the-world-emerge-from-the-coronavirus-crisis\">\u2018We can\u2019t go back to normal\u2019: how will coronavirus change the world?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That is what the emerging-market economies have been suffering since February.

  "<p>Devs is a slow, beautiful sci-fi drama thriller about a machine that can see backwards and forwards in time \u2013 back to Christ on the cross, forward to some looming unknowable crisis. It grapples with all the big questions. Is there such a thing as free will? Do we live in a multiverse? Could we all be part of a complex simulation?</p> <p>Devs is masterminded by Alex Garland, famous for writing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/02/alex-garland-the-beach-20-years-on\">The Beach</a> and directing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/22/ex-machina-review\">Ex</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/22/ex-machina-review\"> Machina</a>. The series has inspired the sort of frantic online rabbit-holing not seen since the glory days of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/lost\">Lost</a>. It\u2019s the show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/westworld--episode-by-episode\">Westworld</a> wishes it was. Its reception in the US has shown what British viewers can expect when it begins on BBC Two this week: give it enough time and it will consume your every waking thought.</p> <p>And yet the strangest thing about Devs is that the beating heart of this very serious show is Nick Offerman. Yes, Nick Offerman from comedy. Nick Offerman from <a href=\"https://offermanwoodshop.com/\">woodwork</a>. Nick Offerman from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/14/how-we-made-parks-and-recreation-amy-poehler-nick-offerman-mike-schur\">Parks and Recreation</a>, the satirical US series about an Indiana town\u2019s parks department in which he played Ron Swanson, the libertarian, anti-government boss striving to make his department as ineffective as possible.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I have a lot of experience of making people laugh. But also making them cringe, vomit and sob</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Speaking from his home in LA, where he\u2019s under lockdown, Offerman seems as surprised about this career turn as anyone. \u201cAny farm boy like myself, that packed up and went off to theatre school, is chasing the dream of working with a person like Alex,\u201d he says. \u201cI was working at my woodwork shop when I got the call that he wanted to meet with me, and I teared up a little bit. In my world, it was not expected that someone like Alex would turn his gaze in my direction.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, it\u2019s perfect casting. Offerman plays Forest, a conspiratorial tech CEO so ravaged with grief for his dead daughter that he\u2019s built a giant statue of her on the grounds of his campus. Amaya, his quantum computing company, is being investigated by engineer Lily Chan, who believes it is responsible for the disappearance of her boyfriend. Although Forest starts the series as an out-and-out villain (and it\u2019s great to see Offerman use his physical heft for something other than excessive meat consumption), we gradually see a more humane side as we understand the rationale for his time-bending invention.</p> <p>How does he feel about the central theme, the question of whether we live in a deterministic universe? \u201cI love ruminating about the big existential questions,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I was brought up in a family of salt-of-the-earth public servants, in the middle of Illinois, in the middle of America. I can wrap my head around the science of determinism, but in my everyday life, it\u2019s the last thing I can think about because I\u2019m usually in the middle of choosing the sandwich I\u2019ll be having for lunch \u2013 and then the slightly larger, warmer sandwich I\u2019ll be having for dinner.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a60c59d997dd881e0a9aa4663c095394a0bed751\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a60c59d997dd881e0a9aa4663c095394a0bed751/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alison Pill and Nick Offerman in Devs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Big questions \u2026 Alison Pill and Nick Offerman in Devs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Raymond Liu</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a very Offerman answer, rooted in both good-hearted Americana and food. Time and time again during our interview, he\u2019ll return to these twin wells, bringing up the morals that were instilled in him by his family and comparing TV reviews to various types of fast food (\u201cWho put gruyere in this cheeseburger? Are you insane? One star!\u201d).</p> <p>Offerman, 49, was born in the tiny village of Minooka to a mother who was a nurse and a father who taught social studies at high school. He\u2019s one of four children and much of his growing up was done on a soybean farm, which is just the sort of quirky background detail that could belong to his most famous character. In fact, if you close your eyes, you feel like you could be talking to Ron Swanson. And this might be becoming a problem.</p> <p>Although Parks and Recreation finished half a decade ago, people still have a tendency to see Offerman through the lens of Swanson. It\u2019s understandable \u2013 the character incorporated many of Offerman\u2019s traits: his flair for woodwork, his talent with a saxophone and his outward projection of gruff manliness. It\u2019s a comparison that Offerman has played up, with books like <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/314287/paddle-your-own-canoe-by-nick-offerman/\">Paddle Your Own Canoe</a> and a standup tour called <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/70299862\">American Ham</a>. But enough is enough. On his most recent comedy tour, Offerman took to singing a song entitled I\u2019m Not Ron Swanson, which contained the lines: \u201cHe can eat a big-ass steak for every single meal / \u2019Cause his colon is fictitious, while mine is all too real.\u201d</p> <p>Was the song born of frustration? \u201cIt\u2019s a little complicated,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause people want to conflate me with Ron Swanson\u2019s politics. He\u2019s a staunch libertarian, and I\u2019m interested in everybody having healthcare or being paid a living wage. When I used to look at social media more closely, there would be angry fans saying, \u2018I brought my shotgun to your comedy show and it turns out you\u2019re a total snowflake.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c6b6044b9498521f77c7d22ea207a2de46a96cbc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6b6044b9498521f77c7d22ea207a2de46a96cbc/39_76_2655_1593/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2026 alongside Amy Poehler in Parks and Recreation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Green shoots of genius \u2026 alongside Amy Poehler in Parks and Recreation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In truth, the two are poles apart. Offerman took two semesters of ballet. He toured Japan doing kabuki theatre. He repeatedly refers to himself as the black sheep of the family, who cries easily and believes Yoko Ono <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpCQ5yWUx7g\">is a misunderstood genius</a>. He\u2019s thoughtful and articulate on gender and race, and very concerned with the issue of sustainable food.</p> <p>There were other downsides to playing Swanson, too. \u201cI couldn\u2019t go to a restaurant. No matter what I ordered, they would put an inch-thick layer of bacon on my plate. I\u2019d order a cheeseburger and they\u2019d make me a one-pound cheeseburger. And I would give them a thumbs-up and hear my cardiologist screaming in my head.\u201d</p> <p>Yet there have always been many sides to Offerman. As well as the tours, the books (four in seven years), his parallel career running a woodshop in LA, and the <a href=\"https://www.earwolf.com/show/in-bed-with-nick-offerman-and-megan-mullally/\">intimate podcast</a> he and his wife Megan Mullally host from their bed, Offerman has amassed a wildly varied filmography. There has been voice work in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/14/ice-age-collision-course-review\">Ice Age</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/13/the-lego-movie-review\">Lego</a> movies, prestigious Oscar bait in the form of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/19/the-founder-review-michael-keaton-mcdonalds-biopic\">The Founder</a>, and such heartfelt little indie films as 2018\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/03/hearts-beat-loud-review-warm-indie-drama\">Hearts Beat Loud</a>. Then there are TV appearances in Curb Your Enthusiasm, Will &amp; Grace and Fargo.</p> <p>\u201cI come from theatre,\u201d he says, referring to Defiant Theater, the experimental Chicago company he co-founded in the early 1990s, winning rave reviews for productions that included everything from Shakespeare to Stephen King. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a street theatre actor, that means you try to perform in a myriad of genres. Whatever\u2019s on that season. So you might do a Sam Shepard play, then maybe a musical. I have a lot of experience on stage of making people laugh certainly \u2013 but also making people cringe, vomit and sob.\u201d</p> <p>Yet Devs feels like his greatest leap so far. It\u2019s a tremendous performance that sees Offerman shuttling between menace, vulnerability, goofiness and outright terror. Perhaps most impressive is the way that, as of a character who can see the future and therefore can never be surprised, he\u2019s able to give such a relatable human performance. Given its themes, the show is bound to alienate as many people as it beguiles \u2013 something Offerman seems fully aware of.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a great novel,\u201d he says. \u201cWith a lot of people you can say, \u2018Oh, you should read this Murakami book.\u2019 And they\u2019ll say, \u2018Are you insane? What is this Windup Bird Chronicle? This is madness.\u2019 But then there will be 15% of people that say, \u2018Oh my god, that was the best book I\u2019ve ever read.\u2019 There is a quote I wear on my sleeve that goes, \u2018If you\u2019re not offending 33% of your audience, then it\u2019s not art.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f23da1707ab1decf615009f6337849863d42b54b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f23da1707ab1decf615009f6337849863d42b54b/259_594_2922_1753/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2026 Offerman (right) with Karl Glusman in Devs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beguiling \u2026 Offerman (right) with Karl Glusman in Devs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Raymond Liu/BBC/FX Networks</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This does not seem like a particularly optimal time to be promoting a TV series, with the world gripped by coronavirus. Does it feel strange? \u201cWell, it does,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, everything is kind of strange. For those of us whose work involves outputting any sort of content to an audience, everything has to be couched with sensitivity to the tragedy unfolding all around us.</p> <p>\u201cFortunately, the greater percentage of us will get through this. A lot of people are suffering and perishing at the hands of the deadly virus. But there are exponentially more people suffering and dying because of the incredible bed-shitting that our administration has performed. The failure \u2013 the face-plant of our government in the face of this pandemic \u2013 has been unbelievably embarrassing and shameful. And continues to be so. I mean, that sad clown just continues to dance and bleat as though the stock market will somehow save him from the incredibly gory butcher\u2019s bill he is being presented with.\u201d</p> <p>He takes a breath. \u201cBut to answer your question, I\u2019m glad \u2013 because I think our show is just magnificent.\u201d</p> <p>Offerman is a reassuring man to talk to in a crisis. There\u2019s a lot of solace to be had in his mixture of political fury and good-natured idealism. \u201cAs an eternal optimist,\u201d he says, \u201cmy hope is that something might come out of this time of reflection, where we\u2019re all being made to hold still for a while. Perhaps when it\u2019s over, we will walk outside and look at a tree, or reacquaint ourselves with squirrels and birds in our neighbourhood, and say, \u2018Oh, there is beauty, there is worth, there is incredible value to the world and to life. And it doesn\u2019t come through my phone, it doesn\u2019t come through consumerism, it doesn\u2019t come from capitalism.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Another deep breath. \u201cI had the good fortune of growing up in a frugal and loving family, so I understood that we can have a beautiful and rewarding life without having three Porsches in the garage. Having three Porsches is not actually that great, because you have to pay to maintain three Porsches. But if you instead get together with your family and build a canoe or a rowboat, you only need one of those. And you can have fun all year.\u201d</p> <p>What a total snowflake.</p> <ul> <li><p>Devs starts on BBC Two at 9pm on Wednesday 15 April.</p></li> </ul>",

Italy to date has registered 20,465 deaths.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Greece\" data-alt=\"Greece daily deaths chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Greece\">Greece daily deaths chart</a> </figure>  <p>Greece, it is generally agreed, is having a better crisis than may have been expected. Tsiodras recently allowed himself to speak of \u201ca flattening of the curve\u201d even if authorities accept that the prospect of Orthodox Easter, on 19 April, is unlikely to be without challenge. Traditionally, Greeks flock to ancestral villages in the countryside to celebrate the biggest festival in their religious calendar.</p> <p>The country\u2019s ability to cope with a public health emergency of such proportions was not a given. After almost a decade embroiled in debt crisis \u2013 years in which its economy contracted by 26% \u2013 Greece\u2019s health system has far from recovered.</p> <p>State hospitals bore the brunt of cuts demanded in return for rescue loans from international lenders to keep the nation afloat and in the eurozone. With the epidemic\u2019s arrival in Europe, officials were forced to acknowledge, 18 months after the country exited its third bailout, that it had only 560 intensive care unit (ICU) beds.</p> <p>It was a stark reality that left no room for mitigation strategy, or contemplating policies of achieving \u201cherd immunity\u201d.</p> <p>Greece, like Italy, also has a large elderly population, with about a quarter of pensionable age. \u201cThere were realities, weaknesses, that we were very aware of,\u201d said Dr Andreas Mentis who heads the Hellenic Pasteur Institute. \u201cBefore the first case was diagnosed, we had started examining people and isolating them. Incoming flights, especially from China, were monitored. Later, when others began to be repatriated from Spain, for example, we made sure they were quarantined in hotels.\u201d</p> <p>Mentis sits on the scientific committee that advises the centre-right government on the deadly disease. What is increasingly being seen as textbook crisis management, even by political foes, has been attributed as much to prioritising science over politics as to a managerial approach that focused on what the 51-year-old prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has described as \u201cstate-sensitivity, co-ordination, resolve and swiftness\u201d.</p> <p>Alex Patelis, Mitsotakis\u2019 economics adviser, said: \u201cThere are problems you can solve through spin and others that require truth and transparency. It was very clear we needed experts and we needed to listen to them. That said, Greeks have been through crisis; they know what it is. I think that also enabled them to adapt and be stoic.\u201d</p> <p>From the outset the 25-strong committee pushed for the socially disruptive choice of lockdown, a devastating option for a country that had only just begun to show signs of economic rejuvenation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"827b913b41111f8f31b929477b8230566f3fc9c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/827b913b41111f8f31b929477b8230566f3fc9c1/0_175_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police close off a seaside promenade in Thessaloniki, Greece\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police close off a seaside promenade in Thessaloniki.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murad Sezer/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In late February, before Greece had recorded its first death, carnival parades were cancelled. On 4 March, before most of Europe, schools were ordered closed. Within days, bars, cafes, restaurants, nightclubs, gyms, malls, cinemas, retail stores, museums and archaeological sites were also shuttered.</p> <p>Traumatic scenes in Italy, across the Adriatic, shocked Greeks as much as anyone else and were highlighted by Tsiodras and Hardalias as they tried to ram home the message of the dangers posed by the disease. </p> <p>The measures were not immediately accepted and in quick succession the government was forced to shut down beaches and ski resorts, ban public gatherings of more than 10 people, prohibit travel to islands to all but permanent residents and \u2013 as argument raged over the power of faith and science \u2013 take on the influential Greek Orthodox church, whose clergy refused to give up services and the rite of Holy Communion. Air links with the worst-affected countries were suspended.</p> <p>But the pandemic was also a catalyst for an administration elected to power last July on an agenda of reform and as Greece went into lockdown, the government announced it was harnessing the crisis to enact long overdue digital reforms aimed at both protecting citizens\u2019 health and modernising the state.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the pandemic broke, the need to simplify government processes became paramount,\u201d Greece\u2019s minister of digital governance, Kyriakos Pierrakakis, told the Guardian. \u201cOne of the first things we did to limit the incentives for people to exit their homes was to enable them to receive prescriptions on their phones. That, alone, has saved 250,000 citizens from making visits to the doctor in the space of 20 days. It has dramatically helped reduce the number of people exiting their home, which can only be a good thing.\u201d</p> <p>Documents that once required appearances at government offices and dealing with a labyrinthine bureaucracy were made available online, likewise saving thousands of trips daily. \u201cBy changing the nature of the interaction of citizens with the state, our hope is that ultimately public trust in institutions will be further regained,\u201d said Pierrakakis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3af59c356badb05b6aa36b1c5201b9d342d20687\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3af59c356badb05b6aa36b1c5201b9d342d20687/0_0_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Migrants quarantined in tents on Lesbos\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People from sub-Saharan Africa in quarantine in a designated space on the island of Lesbos last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manolis Lagoutaris/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, Greece has managed to almost double the number of ICUs. But doctors say testing, limited with rare exception to hospitals, will need to be much more widespread for confidence to prevail. With two refugee camps quarantined after detainees tested positive for coronavirus, concerns abound over facilities described as \u201cticking health bombs\u201d by the government.</p> <p>The costs to an economy so dependent on tourism are already high \u2013 and that is before emergency funding worth \u20ac14.5bn (\u00a312.6bn) in state benefits and tax deferrals is taken into account.</p> <p>For now, however, the government is basking in the limelight of unexpected praise for having flattened the curve.</p> <p>\u201cIf we pull through this, if we show that we are competent and can deliver, the rest will come,\u201d said Patelis, adding that Athens\u2019 objective was to regain some of the credibility that had been shattered during its bailout years. \u201cThe faster you deal with a health crisis, the greater the short-term economic costs, but then the greater the long-term benefits too.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 15 April 2020 to clarify when Greece first closed some schools in response to the coronavirus crisis.</p>",
  "<p>The coronavirus pandemic has led to an unprecedented global surge in digital surveillance, researchers and privacy advocates around the world have said, with billions of people facing enhanced monitoring that may prove difficult to roll back.</p> \n<p>Governments in at least 25 countries are employing vast programmes for mobile data tracking, apps to record personal contact with others, CCTV networks equipped with facial recognition, permission schemes to go outside and drones to enforce social isolation regimes.</p> \n<p>The methods have been adopted by authoritarian states and democracies alike and have opened lucrative new markets for companies that extract, sell, and analyse private data.

Officials last month said they would use mobile apps, employ CCTV cameras with facial recognition, QR codes, mobile phone data and credit card records in a digital surveillance menu that opposition members had termed a \u201ccybergulag\u201d.</p> \n<p>Most quarantine violations are, however, still exposed by physical surveillance, meaning police patrols and roadblocks on the streets. Pavel Chikov of the Agora International Human Rights Group noted that a more sophisticated system could be \u201ctoo expensive\u201d for many of the country\u2019s regions to employ. In Tatarstan, an SMS permission system looked suspiciously similar to a local parking app, suggesting the government may just have adapted the technology.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>When Moscow did finally roll out its QR-code system this week, the website quickly crashed, and remained down on Monday morning.

As the nation began Holy Week, Hardalias chastised priests and bishops who continued to hold services in violation of the recommendations of the Holy Synod, the church\u2019s ruling body, and government orders for \u201cputting people\u2019s lives in danger\u201d. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThey must finally understand that they are not more Christian than the rest,\u201d he said insisting that this Easter would be different, with Greeks staying at home so that the country \u201ccould break the virus\u2019 chain of transmission\u201d. </p> \n  <p>Rogue clerics have been increasingly in the government\u2019s sights amid reports of clerics opening church doors despite the nationwide ban. In a startling snub, for which he has shown no remorse, the Bishop of Corfu, Nektarios, held a service on the island at the weekend attended by a local mayor, a senior municipal councillor and at least three other people. The rite of Holy Communion was also conducted, as is tradition in the Orthodox church, from a shared chalice. The bishop, who was forced to appear before a public prosecutor today, will be tried, along with the two officials who attended the service, on 25 May.

warning that as much effort must be made to fight the virus in care homes as in the NHS, <strong>Robert Booth</strong>, the Guardian\u2019s social affairs correspondent, writes.<br></p> \n  <p>Snapshot data from varying official sources shows that in Italy, Spain, France, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland\">Ireland</a> and Belgium 42%-57% of deaths from the virus have been happening in care homes, according to a report by academics based at the London School of Economics.</p> \n  <p>Published official data for deaths in care homes in England and Wales are believed to significantly underestimate fatalities in the care sector, with the Office for National Statistics currently only accounting for 20 Covid-related deaths in all care homes in the week ending 27 March. Fresh figures are due out on Tuesday, but are unlikely to be be up to date.</p> \n  <p>Last week, the industry body Care England told the Guardian the figure was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/covid-19-hundreds-of-uk-care-home-deaths-not-added-to-official-toll\">likely to be approaching 1,000</a>, with deaths reaching into double figures at numerous homes. Over the weekend, fresh death tolls emerged, including 12 fatalities of residents at the 71-capacity Stanley Park care home in County Durham.
