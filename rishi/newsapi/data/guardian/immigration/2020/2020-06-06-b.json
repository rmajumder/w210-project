The total number of infections in Herat is 3,621 with 64 deaths.</p> \n  <p>In the capital, Kabul, 161 new cases have been recorded. In the remote province of Kunar, five patients tested all returned positive results, as seven patients died of Covid-19 overnight. In Helmand, two patients tested in the last 24 hours both were positive and the province recorded its first death.</p> \n  <p> Meanwhile, amid continuing conflict, at least 20 Afghan security forces personnel were killed in two incidents in the last 24 hours.

confirmed infections.</p> \n  <p>The health ministry reported 9,887 new cases on Saturday, bringing the total to 236,657.</p> \n  <p>Most of the new cases are in rural areas following the return of hundreds of thousands of migrant workers who left cities and towns after the lockdown in late March.</p> \n  <p>The lockdown is now largely being enforced in high-risk areas while authorities have partially restored train services and domestic flights and allowed shops and manufacturing to reopen. </p> \n  <p>Shopping malls and religious places are due to open on Monday with restrictions to avoid large gatherings.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-06T05:11:33.182Z\">at 6.11am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div

In their hands, this crisis will become a setting for shock doctrine and the UK will be at the sharp end.

Now, as they seek to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/13/treasury-tax-hikes-pay-freezes-covid-19-costs-budget-deficit-spending\">claw back \u00a3337bn</a> from public spending, it looks possible that their time in government will be marked by a newer and nastier austerity.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As well as mobilising big numbers, any new movement will need to be disruptive and militant if it is to be effective</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Labour and the wider left have a huge task ahead of them. By 2024, it will be too late to undo much of the damage. A movement of resistance against the onslaught on jobs and public services, on migrants and many basic rights and protections, will have to be urgently built. In the Jeremy Corbyn years, social movements and industrial action tailed off. The left will now have to take its demoralised activist base from cheering on the old Labour leadership to organising protests against NHS privatisation, strikes against a new wave of cuts, rent strikes and direct action in a matter of months. As well as mobilising big numbers, any new movement will need to be disruptive and militant if it is to be effective.</p> <p>Sooner or later, this situation will leave <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/02/keir-starmer-puts-boris-johnson-on-notice-over-handling-of-coronavirus-cummings-labour\">Keir Starmer</a> in an awkward position. On one hand is his instinct to be cautious, and his respectability offensive aimed at winning over middle-ground voters. On the other, his promise to stay true to the radical policies of the Corbyn period, to inspire voters and to be in tune with the grassroots of the party. If he opts for an approach anything like that of Ed Miliband, who infamously refused to back strikes during the anti-austerity movement of 2011, his credibility and popularity will be shattered.</p> <p>To navigate the coming storm, the left will have to be bold, but so too will the Labour leadership. Starmer must situate Labour as the centre of a wider movement against the new austerity and the Tories\u2019 Brexit plans and he must go on the offensive. As Starmer himself has argued, there was never anything to be gained by Labour giving ground to rightwing narratives about immigration. And there is no public support for cuts or for economic deregulation. Every attempt to enact them must be met with resistance and a radical, alternative vision \u2013 at the dispatch box and in the streets.&nbsp;</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Michael Chessum is national organiser for Another Europe Is Possible&nbsp;</p>",

Some states have recorded record spikes in hunting licence applications, a reversal of recent trends and in Vermont, fishing license sales are up more than 50%.How much of this can be ascribed to people with time on their hands, and how much to need is still hard to discern. What is clear is some trends, including the smallholding organic farm movement, coupled with greater awareness of food justice and food insecurity, are coalescing under Covid-19.</p> <p>Some years ago, New York artist Dan Colen purchased Sky High Farm in the Hudson Valley with the idea of giving back. With no farming experience to act on, he called on a friend with experience in public health programme development.</p> <p>Colen sought to form relationships with food-justice organisations, and has delivered more than 81,000lb of vegetables and 41,000lb of protein to date, including a delivery service with Project EATS to elder residents in Brooklyn\u2019s Marcus Garvey apartments.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It makes no sense to have upstate farmers who can\u2019t sell their product and downstate families who can't get enough to eat</p> <footer> <cite>Andrew Cuomo, New York governor</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What\u2019s clear is that the least advantaged, in the city and beyond, are looking at being poorer, and organisations that were focused on farming education are turning to feeding people and building coalitions with community farms.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that we\u2019re going to see the extent of it for a while, but the food pantries are experiencing a massive increase in clients,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ve suddenly got a middle class looking at being food-insecure.\u201d</p> <p>At the same time, pressure adapt is revealing cracks in the system: farmers have reported that crops and herds may have to be destroyed if processing and distribution doesn\u2019t pick up. New York governor Andrew Cuomo identified the problem last week, announcing a $25m New York food bank grant to spend on agricultural products grown in the state.</p> <p>\u201cIt makes no sense to have upstate farmers who can\u2019t sell their product and downstate families who can\u2019t get enough to eat,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Under the shadow of the Catskill mountains, the cold spring has forced Fabio Chizzola to light fires under his apple trees to ward off frost damage into mid-May. He and wife, Laura Ferrara, sidelined careers in fashion, purchasing Westwind Orchard in 2002.</p> <p>Chizzola\u2019s supplies of frozen pork have virtually sold out. As the major food supply chains are threatened, and higher supermarket prices are going some way to narrow the price gap with organic, small-farm produce, he detects a shift.</p> <p>\u201cIn all this craziness, hopefully something positive will come out. Small farmers are the soul of this country and every country. This is not a machine of mass-production, it\u2019s a livelihood, and I hope the world is catching up on that.\u201d</p> <p>Comedy is made of the Covid-quarantined showing-off newfound bread-baking skills, Ferrara shifting dozens of sourdough starters. \u201cYou really can\u2019t fail with bread if you keep trying.

Local restaurants are delivering there, too, in part to keep their staff employed during lockdown. If the big food companies could do anything, she ventures, they could join that effort.</p> <p>Ninety miles from New York, where many might typically compete for heirloom tomatoes at a city farmers\u2019 market, the message, amplified by Covid, is to take more care with ourselves and those around us. \u201cWe\u2019ve been taking a lot of things for granted, and it\u2019s our responsibility to be in the community,\u201d Ferrara says. \u201cThere are people who can\u2019t just call out for a meal.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 This article was updated&nbsp;on Sunday after the original story incorrectly said that Sky High Farm delivered to Brooklyn\u2019s Marcy public housing, not the Marcus Garvey apartments.&nbsp;</em></p> <p><br></p>",

It\u2019s all to do with immigration and the people that have voted to leave the EU \u2026 for me, it\u2019s because of racism, because they don\u2019t want people coming into our country. It frustrates me because if you see some of the places these people are coming from, these other countries, it [the situation there] is a lot worse and we are supposed to be a country of freedom, as is America. So that just proves to me how bad the racism is \u2013 because they\u2019ve had enough of immigrants. It\u2019s just a nail in the coffin.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Things have to change. It\u2019s at a point now where \u2026 what is it going to take?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What is there to do? Gray talks of the need to \u201ckeep protesting and protesting and protesting until things change\u201d, to keep the Black Lives Matter movement at the top of the news agenda.</p> <p>\u201cIt annoyed me to see the whole Madeleine McCann thing come out and try and take away what is going on out there,\u201d Gray says, with reference to how the story of the missing girl has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/04/madeleine-mccann-praia-da-luz-christian-bruckner-strongest-suspect-yet\">returned to the front pages</a> after the identification of a suspect. \u201cThat\u2019s no disrespect to that little girl and her family. But to me it seemed to be trying to brush aside what is really going on in the Black Lives Matter protest.</p> <p>\u201cIs it because she\u2019s a white girl? Yes. That\u2019s the facts. What people are not seeming to understand at the minute is these are the things that are happening. This is where it goes beyond the blatant racism we are seeing and the videos [of police brutality] and whatever. This is stuff that really hurts people, as well.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f8b5562614329c4a1f2148d1169bf57c55cf4a28\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8b5562614329c4a1f2148d1169bf57c55cf4a28/1183_0_2918_3648/800.jpg\" alt=\"Jadon Sancho celebrates scoring for Borussia Dortmund against Paderborn by revealing a \u2018Justice for George Floyd\u2019 undershirt\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jadon Sancho celebrates scoring for Borussia Dortmund against Paderborn by revealing a \u2018Justice for George Floyd\u2019 undershirt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lars Baron/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThings have to change. It\u2019s at a point now where \u2026 what is it going to take? People are complaining about the protests, they\u2019ve always got something to say but they don\u2019t understand how we feel. They don\u2019t get it. All they want to say is: \u2018No, all lives matter,\u2019 but this is not the point. We are fighting because black lives don\u2019t matter. That is as simple as it is.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy for a white person to think we have got it good or whatever but we don\u2019t because you\u2019re not the person that\u2019s getting pulled over by the police, you are not the person that is getting judged by what you wear and how you look. You are not the person that has to pick and choose where you go, what countries you go to because of things like this. They will never get it. That is the ignorance of it.\u201d</p> <p>Gray hopes to see gestures of support from players during Premier League matches, as has happened in the Bundesliga. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want it just to be a phase \u2013 it needs to be for ever,\u201d Gray says. \u201cRacism has been in football since football started, it\u2019s never going away, it\u2019s never got better. It\u2019s just noticed more because everything is on TV, everything is magnified.</p> <p>\u201cSo I hope players take a stand and I hope this is more than just wearing a T-shirt of Kick It Out. That hasn\u2019t worked before and it\u2019s not going to work now. We need to push and have a stronger stand on it.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><strong>India</strong>&nbsp;has overtaken&nbsp;<strong>Italy</strong>&nbsp;as the sixth worst-affected country, after another biggest single-day rise in confirmed Covid-19 infections.</p> <p>India\u2019s health ministry reported 9,887 new cases on Saturday, bringing the official total to 236,657. The country has fewer confirmed cases than only the&nbsp;<strong>U</strong><strong>S</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Brazil</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Russia</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Britain</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Spain</strong>.</p> <p>India\u2019s official death toll of 6,642 is relatively low compared with the other countries, but experts say the country is still nowhere near its peak and doctors fear what will happen once the imminent monsoon season begins.</p> <p>Despite there being no sign the infection curve flattening, the country will begin opening up on Monday after more than two months of the world\u2019s largest lockdown, which has involved 1.3 billion people. Shopping malls and places of worship will open their doors, but no large gatherings, distributions of food offerings, sprinkling of holy water or touching of idols and holy books will be allowed.</p> <p>Almost half of the country\u2019s known cases have been traced to the four densely populated cities of Delhi, Chennai, Ahmedabad and Mumbai, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/29/india-mumbai-hospitals-overwhelmed-coronavirus-cases\">where hospitals have already run out of beds</a> and patients sleep on floors and share oxygen tanks. As the millions of migrant workers who spent weeks trapped in the cities return home, however, they are spreading the virus to remote rural areas that often have no medical facilities to speak of.</p> <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) noted on Friday that India\u2019s lockdown had helped it dampen transmission of the disease but said there was a risk cases would rise again as people returned to their ordinary lives.</p> <p>\u201cAs India and other large countries open up and people begin to move, there is always a risk of the disease bouncing back up,\u201d Dr Mike Ryan, the head of WHO\u2019s emergencies programme, told a news conference in Geneva.</p> <p>Latin America remains a coronavirus hotspot, and the situation deteriorated in <strong>Mexico,</strong> where the health ministry reported an additional 4,346 cases and 625 new deaths. That brought the country\u2019s confirmed total to 110,026 cases and 13,170 deaths.</p> <p>Despite the rising infection rate, Mexico\u2019s president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/coronavirus-brazil-record-daily-death-toll-mexico\">continued to insist</a> his strategy had been effective. He dismissed media reports about the escalating death toll, which is second only to Brazil\u2019s in the region, as alarmist and irresponsible.</p> <p>The death toll also continued to rise in <strong>Russia, </strong>where 197 people died in the past 24 hours. The country\u2019s official death toll is 5,725. There were also 8,855 new cases, according to officials. This pushed the total number of recorded infections to 458,689.</p> <p>The official death toll has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/st-petersburg-death-tally-casts-doubt-on-russian-coronavirus-figures\">called into question</a> after mortality data from Russia\u2019s second-largest city,&nbsp;St Petersburg, revealed it had issued 1,552 more death certificates in May 2020 than in May 2019, a rise of a 32%. It was a strong indicator that hundreds of deaths caused by Covid-19 are not being reflected in the city\u2019s official coronavirus death toll for the month, which was 171.</p> <p>The number of confirmed coronavirus cases increased in <strong>Germany</strong> by 407 to 183,678.</p> <p><strong> China</strong>&nbsp;recorded three new confirmed cases, down from five the day before. All were imported from abroad, according to the National Health Commission (NHC). The total number of infections in China, where the virus first emerged late last year, stands at 83,030.</p> <p>The G20 pledged on Saturday to provide more than $21bn (\u00a317bn) to fight the coronavirus. The group called on all countries, NGOs, philanthropies and the private sector in April to help close a financing gap estimated at more than $8bn to combat the pandemic.</p> <p>The group said in a statement: \u201cThe G20, with invited countries, has coordinated the global efforts to support the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. To date, G20 members and invited countries have pledged over $21bn to support funding in global health.</p> <p>\u201cThe pledges will be directed towards diagnostics, vaccines, therapeutics and research and development.\u201d</p> <p>The airline industry continues to reel from the effects of the pandemic. United Airlines became to latest airline to announce cuts with the closure of cabin crew bases in Hong Kong, Tokyo and Frankfurt.</p> <p><strong>New Zealand</strong> is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/05/cant-quite-believe-it-new-zealand-tiptoes-towards-elimination-of-coronavirus\">on course to declare itself free of Covid-19</a> by next week. It would be the first country among the OECD group of wealthy countries, and the first that has recorded more than 100 cases, to do so.</p> <p>Hailed for its successful containment of the virus, New Zealand has recorded only 22 coronavirus deaths. The last person known to have contracted the virus domestically left quarantine on 18 May. Scientists said they would be able to declare the domestic elimination of the virus after 28 days of no known cases, which will be on 15 June.</p> <p>\u201cAccording to our model, that would put us nearly at the 99% probability of elimination,\u201d said Nick Wilson, a public health specialist from the University of Otago.</p> <p>Elsewhere around the world:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Poland&nbsp;</strong>plans to extend a ban on international flights until 16 June.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Australia</strong>\u2019s deputy prime minister,&nbsp;Michael McCormack, said China\u2019s warnings that its citizens were not safe from racist attacks in the country related tocoronavirus were based on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/06/coronavirus-live-news-china-warns-of-covid-linked-racial-violence-overseas?page=with:block-5edb06538f08bd75dbb62cd1#block-5edb06538f08bd75dbb62cd1\">\u201cfalse information\u201d</a>.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Indonesia</strong>&nbsp;reported its biggest daily rise in Covid-19 infections, with 993 new cases, taking its total official number to 30,514.</p></li> <li><p>The&nbsp;<strong>Philippines\u2019</strong>&nbsp;health ministry reported seven new coronavirus deaths and 714 new infections.

He labelled the argument \u201cfutile\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Justice Fagan also acknowledged the right to protest and the importance of the Black Lives Matter protest in drawing attention to the treatment of Indigenous Australians at the hands of police, but reasoned that many Australians had had to forfeit rights during the pandemic, including to attend church and forfeiting their livelihoods.</p> \n  <p>Organisers had previously indicated they and supporters would attend the protest regardless of the legal decision, and it has been noted that last week in Sydney some 3,000 people gathered to join a protest based on conspiracy theories over 5G and police took no action.</p> \n  <p>Amnesty International UK had called for the protest to be allowed, saying that \u201cPeaceful protest is a fundamental human right, and the New South Wales police should work with organisers to ensure that attendees can social distance, and protests can be carried out in a safe manner.

At first glance, it looks like a decorous way to deal with a leak in the ceiling, but the arrangement is for ritual and reflection. \u201cMy mother had a lot of crystals in her house,\u201d Donoso says. \u201cI was meditating with her from the age of 11.

  "<p>Nirmal Purja is someone who responds to a crisis by becoming completely calm. When the Nepalese mountaineer saw the line of about 100 people waiting to reach the crest of Everest on 22 May last year, he knew there was no way he could overtake the slower climbers. Mentally, he abandoned the record he was attempting, for the fastest climb between the neighbouring peaks of Lhotse and Everest.</p> <p>Poor weather at the start of the climbing season had meant there was only a very small window of time in which people could attempt the summit \u2013 just three clear days. In 2018, the year before, there had been 11 good days, allowing climbing companies to stagger their teams. Purja had known there would be queues, but was taken aback by the numbers.</p> <p>Purja, a 36-year-old veteran of the Royal Navy\u2019s elite Special Boat Service, has climbed Everest four times, and was philosophical. \u201cIt is what it is. I always try to stay calm on the mountain,\u201d he tells me, speaking from his home in Winchester. In normal circumstances, he would have been up Everest this year, but he is defusing the frustrations of lockdown by <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beyond-Possible-Soldier-Fourteen-Peaks/dp/1529312248/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=\" title=\"\">writing a book</a> about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/01/nirmal-nims-purja-speed-climber-worlds-14-highest-peaks-everest\" title=\"\">climbing all 14 of the world\u2019s highest mountains</a> in just 189 days last year.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Summits can be a disappointment when you see that number of people taking selfies in such a spiritual place</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He took a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/26/i-wont-be-joining-queue-everest-overcrowding-summit\" title=\"\">picture of the queue at the top of Everest</a>, which he later posted on Instagram, mainly as an explanation to his sponsors and supporters \u2013 a vivid image of the obstacle that had slowed him down. Then he tried to assess how he could help. He knew things could go catastrophically wrong, and quickly; this stretch of Everest, from the sheer rockface of the Hillary Step to the summit, was the most exposed part of the climb, with drops of up to 3,000 metres (9,842ft) on either side. As people queued, they got colder and used up unplanned-for quantities of their oxygen supplies. It was literally the worst place on Earth to get stuck in a queue.</p> <p>Looking at the line, with climbers travelling in both directions, Purja realised it would be impossible to rescue anyone who needed to be taken off the summit fast. Every climber was clipped to a safety rope, and the path is too narrow to allow the more experienced climbers to unclip and pass the slower climbers. The queue continued to build. Purja couldn\u2019t be confident that other climbers would be helpful in an emergency. \u201cIf you have to drag a body through that, no one would be able to give up the path to them. There <em>is</em> no path, and people are in their own survival state at that altitude, struggling to put one foot in front of another. Everyone is in that fine line between death and life.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e4d7f852ea7942ad8bad5eddfb1b2b9537112e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e4d7f852ea7942ad8bad5eddfb1b2b9537112e7/1676_0_2765_3456/800.jpg\" alt=\"Nirmal Purja at the summit of Everest summit in May 2019.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nirmal Purja at the summit of Everest in May 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: published with permission of Nirmal Purja</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Purja paused at Hillary Step and tried to quell flaring tensions between climbers; there were arguments about whether the people trying to get to the summit should be given priority over those trying to descend. \u201cI managed the queue for two hours. Rather than people fighting over who should go up first, it\u2019s better if it is managed systematically,\u201d he says. He worked out who had been waiting in critically cold conditions for the longest and prioritised them, and tried to calm the other climbers, taking off his mask to issue instructions.</p> <p>Purja\u2019s experience and military background meant that climbers were happy to be guided by him. Elsewhere, local Nepalese guides were finding it harder to convince their clients that they needed to turn back. There was a dangerous clash between the typically alpha-plus personalities of people who want to summit Everest and their guides, who are dependent on their fees for survival.</p> <p>\u201cWhen people are in stressful situations, they do shout,\u201d Purja says. \u201cYou can only get a few words out at that altitude: \u2018Move faster! Come off!\u2019 I disagree with it, but people come to Everest carrying a huge financial burden. Not only that, but they have spent more than two months and a lot of effort to be ready. That\u2019s why everybody rushes for the top.\u201d</p> <p>A year on, Thomas Becker tells me he remains disturbed by the behaviour he witnessed while queueing to reach the highest place on Earth. He is a lifelong climber, although it was his first attempt at Everest. He describes the experience as being \u201cvery <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2012/jan/24/review-lord-flies-william-golding\" title=\"\">Lord Of The Flies</a>\u201d. At the worst part of the queue, he was stuck in a line of around 40 climbers, behind a woman who was struggling. He had never met her and didn\u2019t know her name, but was worried by how inexperienced she seemed, unable to use her ice axe. He spent several hours helping her, so that he could shuffle forward himself, patiently advising her where to put her feet and catching her when she slipped. Behind them, tempers began to fray and climbers started swearing: \u201cFucking get moving!\u201d, \u201cGet the fuck off here!\u201d, \u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"21f6fa14899d3f96cd84c098ab671ab3f5b0d946\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21f6fa14899d3f96cd84c098ab671ab3f5b0d946/1_0_2695_2022/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thomas Becker, who teaches law at Harvard, climbing Everest\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomas Becker, who teaches law at Harvard, describes queuing on Everest as \u2018very Lord Of The Flies\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Thomas Becker</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Becker, a former rock guitarist who teaches human rights law at Harvard, was startled by the ruthlessness of his fellow climbers. Earlier in the day, he had discovered that someone had stolen eight of the oxygen tanks his team had stashed by their tents at base camp, which meant he was climbing the most dangerous stretch of the mountain with just two canisters instead of six. The theft was \u201cdisappointing\u201d, he says now, with polite understatement. \u201cThere is a code of ethics on the mountain that you don\u2019t steal anyone else\u2019s oxygen, because it could be fatal.\u201d He was also puzzled. \u201cThis is not the norm. Sometimes, someone might take one to stay alive, but to have a big chunk of tanks stolen... The folks we were with said this was the first time they had ever seen anything like that.\u201d</p> <p>He managed to feel a brief sense of elation as he embarked on the final stretch, edging closer to an ambition he had held since reading about Everest as a child. But it was a fleeting sensation. \u201cIt became less exciting when we started to see people being brought down, dead bodies. It became sad quickly.\u201d By the time he got to the summit, he had walked past a number of corpses. \u201cJust 10 minutes shy of Hillary Step, there was a guy attached to a rope who had passed away, dangling there. I think I saw five bodies that day, six maybe. There are people literally lying in your path, frozen,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s brutal.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are people who call up and ask: \u2018I\u2019ve never climbed anything. Can I go with your company? And I need a discount\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Purja\u2019s startling images of the queue at the top of Everest quickly went round the world. People who know nothing about mountaineering were shocked by this contradiction between the mountain\u2019s reputation as a lonely and unattainable peak, and the banal reality of a rush-hour crush. But it was more than banal: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/28/walking-over-bodies-mountaineers-describe-the-carnage-at-the-top-of-mount-everest\" title=\"\">11 people died on Everest that May</a>, more than twice the number of climbers who had perished the previous year \u2013 a figure widely attributed to the crowded conditions and the extra physical stresses caused by waiting in temperatures of -30C, at an altitude where oxygen levels are not sufficient to sustain human life. Climbers call it \u201cthe death zone\u201d.</p> <p>But within the climbing community, people were less surprised. Last year\u2019s was just a more extreme version of the bottlenecks that have been troubling the mountain with increasing frequency. The deaths were not caused by the queue itself, they argue, but a different problem: the rising numbers of inexperienced climbers who view Everest as the ultimate selfie destination, and the proliferation of companies willing to take their money and let them have a go, regardless of their ability.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ebaeae09a8c5c04c093ba535759d6725f44072d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ebaeae09a8c5c04c093ba535759d6725f44072d/0_76_3264_1957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Expedition leader Greg Vernovage with his Nepalese team\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Climbers don\u2019t know the risks and aren\u2019t concerned with them,\u2019 says expedition leader Greg Vernovage, centre, with his team.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Greg Vernovage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere are people who call up and ask: \u2018I\u2019ve never climbed anything. Can I go with your company? And I need a discount,\u2019\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.mountainguides.com/guides.shtml\" title=\"\">Greg Vernovage</a>, Everest expedition leader with International Mountain Guides, a well-established climbing firm. \u201cUnfortunately, there is probably a company out there now that will take them. It\u2019s very easy to jump on your computer and dig around for the lowest common denominator.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, 381 permits to climb the mountain were issued by the Nepalese government (a record number, 35 more than the previous year). The cost of climbing Everest varies wildly; cut-price operators will offer to take you up for as little as $30,000 (\u00a324,600) \u2013 a price that includes the $11,000 (\u00a39,000) permit \u2013 or you can pay $200,000 (\u00a3164,000) if you want to stay at the best hotels in the Nepalese capital of Kathmandu and be taken by the most experienced guides. Last autumn, Nepal\u2019s Ministry of Tourism showed no sign of wanting to restrict the numbers of permits issued after last season, encouraging more people to come \u201cfor both pleasure and fame\u201d.</p> <p>There is suspicion that less well-established guides and companies find it harder to tell tourists they need to turn back if they see them struggling. \u201cJust like a kid thinks they can eat a whole bag of candy without getting sick, climbers just want to stand on top. They don\u2019t know the risks and they aren\u2019t concerned with them,\u201d Vernovage says. \u201cCompanies need to be a bit more forceful with clients. Just because you pay the money, that doesn\u2019t give you a ticket to be on the summit team. I\u2019ve had that difficult conversation with people.\u201d</p> <p>The cheaper firms have fewer backup staff, lower supplies of spare oxygen and less ability to manage things when dangerous situations arise. Purja, who runs <a href=\"https://www.nimsdai.com/\" title=\"\">his own climbing company</a>, attributes the higher number of deaths in 2019 not so much to the numbers on the mountain as to the growth of cheaper operators, who employ less experienced guides. \u201cWe have backup people to help clients who are struggling. If everyone had been climbing with that support, no one would have struggled.\u201d</p> <p>Four Indian climbers were among the dead last year, leading to speculation that lower average salaries in India result in these climbers choosing cheaper tour operators, with tragic consequences. Attempting the mountain is expensive, so climbers are sometimes older, at the end of their careers, with expendable income but less physical stamina.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I saw people take 14 hours to cover a distance that took me two \u2013 people who usually have nothing to do with mountains</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There has been no climbing season this year. The view from the ground has been spectacular: the disappearance of a pollution haze means the snow-capped peaks of Everest have been visible from Kathmandu for the first time in decades. But the only people on the mountain are a small group of Chinese researchers and surveyors \u2013 there to place 5G masts, and to mark the 60th anniversary of the first Chinese ascent of the north side of the mountain. </p> <p>On 13 March, Nepal\u2019s government locked down Everest, announcing that no climbing would be allowed on the mountain because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Police have patrolled the roads nearby to prevent anyone approaching. The cooks, porters and guides who help international tourists attempt the summit have mostly returned to their villages. With the disappearance of a year\u2019s income, many have been pushed into destitution; a number of climbers have <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/climbing-community-fund-covid19\" title=\"\">launched fundraisers</a> to help Everest workers feed themselves and their families.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m doing fine, I\u2019m in England, I\u2019ve managed to get income from my book,\u201d Purja says. \u201cBut the community there is suffering.

As soon as he saw the queues at the top, he understood he was going to have to turn around. He was making an entirely self-sufficient attempt to summit, carrying his own kit and without oxygen \u2013 the most intensely challenging way to climb the mountain. \u201cThere are only a tiny fraction of people who can climb without oxygen,\u201d he says. He views its use as a form of cheating, \u201clike doping, like an enhancing drug\u201d. But without oxygen, it was too risky to wait in line. He abandoned his climb around 100 vertical metres from the summit. It wasn\u2019t the crowds that surprised him: \u201cYou don\u2019t go to Everest for a lonely adventure,\u201d he says. But he was dismayed by the slowness of the people ahead of him.</p> <p>\u201cI saw people who took 14 hours to cover a distance that took me two hours \u2013 these are people who usually have nothing to do with mountains.

It is surprising that there are not more of them, given how unprepared and naive people are. They pay the money and hire an agency, and think that this is a summit guarantee.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://eliasaikaly.com/\" title=\"\">Elia Saikaly</a>, a Canadian film-maker, was on Everest last year to make a documentary about a team of four women from Saudi Arabia, Oman and Lebanon. Like G\u00f6ttler, they made their ascent the day after Purja\u2019s photograph was taken, when the queues were still long. Saikaly had attempted Everest many times before, and succeeded on two earlier occasions. But he remains <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/audio/2019/jun/04/death-carnage-chaos-a-climber-on-his-recent-ascent-up-everest\" title=\"\">troubled by what he saw that day</a>; he is now making a film about how his attitude to the mountain was changed by his experiences.</p> <p>There were between 25 and 40 people on and around the summit when Saikaly arrived at the tiny plateau at the top, a patch of mountain not much bigger than the surface area of a couple of ping-pong tables. He felt subdued as he arrived there. \u201cI didn\u2019t want anything to do with it, to be honest. Summits can be a bit of a disappointment, when you see that number of people taking selfies in such a spiritual place,\u201d Saikaly says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the pure experience it once was. The loss of life is very challenging. It makes you question why people do this and why you are there. We celebrated quietly.\u201d</p> <p>Becker also had mixed feelings as he stood at the peak, contemplating his achievement. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t an \u2018I found God\u2019 moment at the top that some people say they have. I was torn,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve dreamed about climbing it since I was a kid. But I think the 13-year-old me would have found it upsetting to go to the mountain and see it like that.\u201d</p> <p>Becker says he felt alienated by the \u201calmost colonialist culture of must-conquer-the-mountains\u201d. Some of his fellow climbers had already conquered figurative mountains in their business careers. \u201cThey think, because of that, they can conquer <em>the</em> mountain. There are people who paid six figures to get to the top and so they think: \u2018I\u2019m going to get my money\u2019s worth. I must make it to the top of the mountain, who cares what happens?\u2019 I think it draws certain people who will be happy to go to the top, at almost any cost to themselves and others.\u201d</p> <p>As well as this nagging ambivalence, Becker was in physical difficulty: his attempts to ration his depleted oxygen supply had led to his tank freezing; his mask had frozen on to his face and beard, the condensation inside it creating a cascade of ice down his front; his goggles were frozen to his suit. Without goggles, he was worried about developing ice blindness in the glare of the sun on the descent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d9a658032b79849e0d6222c048e6f863092f83f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d9a658032b79849e0d6222c048e6f863092f83f/0_0_3088_2316/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US guide Garrett Madison on Everest with flags and other climbers behind him\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It can be a good reality check; it reinforces the gravity of it all,\u2019 says US guide Garrett Madison of seeing dead climbers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Garrett Madison</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most of all he, like other climbers on Everest last year, was very shaken by the experience of having to walk past so many dead climbers. <a href=\"https://madisonmountaineering.com/garrett-madison/\" title=\"\">Garrett Madison</a>, a US guide who was climbing with Saikaly, says it is something climbers see every year, but remains hard to get used to. \u201cFor a first-time climber, it can be shocking,\u201d he says. \u201cIt can be a good reality check; it reinforces the gravity of it all.\u201d</p> <p>Conditions are so harsh at the summit that it is usually impossible to expend energy on carrying bodies back. \u201cIt is a major effort to bring a corpse down,\u201d Madison says. \u201cIt is not like you can just chuck them on your back and trot on down.\u201d</p> <p>Becker was unable to avert his eyes. \u201cThe first person had the same boots as me, the same scrawny build as me. It was scary \u2013 he looked like me. I imagined myself in that situation, and I very much did not want to be in that situation. I was just sad for this guy. I thought about his family \u2013 does he have kids or a wife, or parents? What are they going to think?\u201d</p> <p>Worse was a sense that some seemed unconsciously to revel in the danger. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that anyone saw a dead body and thought: \u2018Oh, this is great!\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cThere were some people who seemed upset about it. But there were others whose attitude was \u2013 and I\u2019m speculating \u2013 \u2018Wow, this is such a dangerous mountain, and I made it!\u2019 It almost made it more romantic that they made it to the top despite these deaths. That attitude was pretty uncomfortable.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>In the wake of last year\u2019s queues, there has been renewed discussion in Nepal about how better regulation of firms and climbers could be introduced. Some trekking firms would like firmer control of how many climbers can attempt the summit on a given day. A government panel recommended that anyone applying for a permit must in future show that they have successfully completed a 6,500 metre (21,325ft) climb, but the proposals had not been implemented before Covid-19 prompted lockdown. The damage caused to the country\u2019s tourist industry may have reduced the willingness to regulate.</p> <p>This April, a team of Nepalese soldiers had been due to mount an expedition to remove the mess that has been accumulating on the mountain for years: piles of empty fuel canisters, tents (the climbing company\u2019s logo carefully cut out before they were abandoned, to avoid responsibility), food wrappers and human excrement. But when climbing permits were cancelled, the cleanup operation was also abandoned.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Last year there was a line of people quite literally dying because of the over-commercialisation of the mountain</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>No one is sure whether the crowds will return next year. Most climbers who were forced to cancel trips this spring would like to return in 2021, which means the queues could be heavier still, with two years\u2019 worth of tourists attempting to summit at once. But if there is a global economic slump, fewer people will have the spare money to fund this very expensive adventure travel.</p> <p>Purja hopes that climbers will come back, to restore the livelihoods of the Nepalese climbing community, but he also hopes the next season will be cleaner and less chaotic. Other climbers say last year\u2019s season has made them re-evaluate their attitude to Everest.</p> <p>\u201cLast year there was a line of people quite literally dying because of the over-commercialisation of the mountain,\u201d Becker says. \u201cPeople have come to think, if you throw money at it you can get to the top, which brings more inexperienced people to the mountain and more sherpas to work there. It does make me reflect on what kind of climbing I want to do, what\u2019s responsible and doesn\u2019t endanger myself and others. And to think about whether I am perpetuating this culture \u2013 the romanticisation of Everest. I worry that, am I in some way part of the problem?\u201d</p>",

He understands how to wield power and holds a consistent worldview. He\u2019s an aggressive advocate for executive power and the police \u2013 who happens to be America\u2019s top law enforcement officer at the same time as unrest roils the country.</p> <p>\u201cBarr is vastly more intelligent than Donald Trump,\u201d&nbsp;Stuart Gerson, a former colleague of Barr\u2019s,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/magazine/william-barr-attorney-general.html\">recently told</a>&nbsp;the New York Times Magazine. \u201cWhat Trump gives Bill Barr is a canvas upon which to paint. Bill has longstanding views about how society should be organized, which can now be manifested and acted upon to a degree that they never could have before.\u201d&nbsp;(Gerson was my boss when I worked at the US Department of Justice from 1990 to 1992. Barr was head of the department from November 1991 to January 1993.)</p> <p>Trump and Barr are close in age. Both grew up during the Vietnam war and the 1960s- and 1970s-era unrest. But where young Trump\u2019s&nbsp;\u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQcTOxaW62s\">personal Vietnam</a>\u201d&nbsp;involved&nbsp;dodging syphilis, avoiding the draft, \u201cbone spurs\u201d and apprenticeship in his father\u2019s growing real estate empire, Vietnam, for&nbsp;young \u201cBilly\u201d Barr,&nbsp;was different. The war was part of his family\u2019s reality.</p> <p>Barr\u2019s older brother was&nbsp;in Vietnam,&nbsp;fighting in the navy.&nbsp;Barr\u2019s&nbsp;father had served&nbsp;in the army during the Second World War&nbsp;and&nbsp;was a member of the Office of Strategic Services, the forerunner to the Central Intelligence Agency.&nbsp;</p> <p>As a Columbia undergraduate, Barr stood fast against&nbsp;the&nbsp;anti-war protesters who sought to bring the university to its knees.&nbsp;Back then, the operative divide was \u201cStaten Island v Scarsdale\u201d \u2013&nbsp;conservative, often Catholic, students from the&nbsp;blue-collar New York City outer borough versus liberal, often Jewish, students from affluent suburbs.&nbsp;Barr, though far from working-class, was firmly planted in the first camp.&nbsp;</p> <p>At the time, radical leftwing&nbsp;activists such as Berkeley\u2019s Mario Savio argued that people of conscience must&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.metrotimes.com/news-hits/archives/2014/12/01/mario-savios-bodies-upon-the-gears-speech-50-years-later\">throw themselves</a>&nbsp;against the machinery of the state.&nbsp;Barr, in contrast,&nbsp;saw himself as holding the line against anarchy and disorder.&nbsp;When protesters attempted to storm the university library, Barr and a group of counter-protesters blocked them. The standoff, according to the New York Times, was resolved by a massive fistfight. The counter-protestors won.</p> <p>Ultimately, however, Barr\u2019s side of the student culture war lost. Nixon, though an anti-communist, knew the American public\u2019s appetite for the war was rapidly depleting. He pulled America out of Vietnam after 20,000 US soldiers were killed on his watch.&nbsp;</p> <p>When Saigon fell&nbsp;and the draft ended, the two sides of the culture war retreated to their respective&nbsp;corners. Leftist students started their \u201clong march through the institutions\u201d \u2013 academia, journalism and the cultural sphere.&nbsp;</p> <p>And Barr and the pro-Vietnam crowd started their own long march, too. Barr briefly served in the CIA as an analyst and then in the agency\u2019s legislative counsel\u2019s&nbsp;office,&nbsp;where he met George HW Bush, then helming the agency.&nbsp;When Bush was later elected president, in&nbsp;1988, Barr&nbsp;joined the administration and&nbsp;rapidly rose&nbsp;to the top of the justice department,&nbsp;where he served his first tenure as attorney general.&nbsp;A profile&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-06-21-op-1236-story.html\">at the time</a>&nbsp;described Barr as a \u201cbookish-looking son of educators who speaks with a muted New York accent\u201d,&nbsp;and extremely effective.</p> <p>During the 1992 Los Angeles riots following the Rodney King verdict,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-should-ask-george-hw-bush-what-happens-when-william-barrs-the-attorney-general-and-a-citys-on-fire?ref=author\">Barr argued</a>&nbsp;that \u201cour system is fair and does not treat people differently\u201d. He conceded that \u201cour national criminal-justice system is a diverse [and] broad one\u201d,&nbsp;with cases of individual bias, but that \u201ctaken in its totality, the system seems to operate fairly\u201d.&nbsp;He&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/03/politics/bill-barr-los-angeles-riots-attorney-general/index.html\">blamed</a>&nbsp;the riots mainly on opportunistic gang violence.</p> <p>After two days of rioting,&nbsp;Bush and Barr invoked the Insurrection Act at the request of California\u2019s Republican governor, Pete Wilson. The statute is a rarely-used provision that permits the president to use federal military forces for domestic law enforcement, which is normally illegal. Together with the national guard, the US army and marines deployed to LA and helped restored order.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the Trump presidency, history has offered Barr a kind of do-over</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Today the US faces a situation akin to the 1992 riots, not to mention the 1960s clashes over Vietnam.&nbsp;Barr and the pro-Vietnam crowd lost&nbsp;that&nbsp;battle, but hoped to win the war.&nbsp;Now, in the Trump presidency, history has offered Barr a kind of do-over.</p> <p>In the New York Times,&nbsp;Gerson,&nbsp;Barr\u2019s former justice department colleague,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/magazine/william-barr-attorney-general.html\">characterized</a>&nbsp;Barr&nbsp;as \u201chierarchical\u201d and \u201cauthoritarian\u201d in outlook, committed to the premise that \u201ca top-down ordering of society will produce a more moral society\u201d.</p> <p>In speeches,&nbsp;Barr, a traditionalist Catholic, has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-william-p-barr-delivers-remarks-law-school-and-de-nicola-center-ethics\">railed</a>&nbsp;against \u201cmilitant secularists\u201d, who seek \u201cto mitigate the social costs of personal misconduct and irresponsibility\u201d.</p> <p>Barr and many conservatives of his generation&nbsp;remember&nbsp;the 1960s&nbsp;cultural revolution as a kind of traumatic rupture in US history \u2013 a Pandora\u2019s box that unleashed decadence, sexual permissiveness&nbsp;and&nbsp;rebelliousness, and led to the&nbsp;atomization of society and the decline of the family&nbsp;unit. The results, as they see it, were leftist militancy, drug&nbsp;addiction, out-of-wedlock childbirth and a decoupling of religion from society. For a certain kind of conservative, undoing that legacy&nbsp;has been a decades-long political project.</p> <p>In the long term, Trump\u2019s real legacy as president may be the stamp he puts on the federal judiciary. The judges he has appointed \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/05/05/how-close-is-president-trump-to-his-goal-of-record-setting-judicial-appointments/\">193 so far</a>, including two supreme court justices \u2013 are already wading into fierce legal disputes concerning abortion, immigration, sexual orientation and other issues. Their rulings will reverberate long after Trump leaves office. His judicial nominations are frequently&nbsp;drawn from the ranks of the Federalist Society, a conservative legal organization founded in the early 1980s at&nbsp;the&nbsp;Harvard, Yale and University of Chicago&nbsp;law schools&nbsp;as a counterweight to&nbsp;what its members perceived as&nbsp;the liberal orthodoxies prevalent at the leading law schools.</p> <p>The Federalist Society and its supporters, <a href=\"https://fedsoc.org/contributors/william-barr\">including Barr</a>, frame themselves as favoring strict readings of the constitution; in practice, however, they have frequently pushed for the expansion of executive power. One particular target of their hostility is the 1973 War Powers Act, Congress\u2019s attempt to reassert itself&nbsp;after&nbsp;the debacle of Vietnam&nbsp;and rein in the war-making powers of the president.&nbsp;</p> <p>In 2001,&nbsp;looking back at the Gulf war and his advice as attorney general to&nbsp;then president&nbsp;George HW Bush,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/bill-barr-war-powers-insights-his-2001-oral-history-interview\">Barr recalled</a>: \u201cI believed that the president did not require any authorization from Congress, and I believed that the president had constitutional authority to launch an attack against the Iraqis.\u201d</p> <p>Now the battlefield is urban America.

  "<p>Justice advocates in Victoria believe disadvantaged groups may have been unfairly targeted by the state\u2019s police during the enforcement of Covid-19 lockdown laws, after new data revealed areas with higher migrant populations and significant social housing stock have been among the most heavily enforced.</p> \n<p>Victoria police released location data for the almost 6,000 fines issued for breaches of the state\u2019s public health orders. The data showed there had been little correlation between enforcement of the orders and the spread of Covid-19 in the state.</p> \n<p>Besides the city of Melbourne, which had far more fines recorded than any other council area in the state, an analysis of Covid-19 infection data showed many areas with a high number of cases had seen relatively low enforcement.</p> \n<p>In Stonnington, an affluent area in Melbourne\u2019s inner east, there were 82 fines issued by Victoria police to 17 May despite the area having the state\u2019s second-highest number of cases. Banyule, in the city\u2019s north-east, had the third-highest number of cases but had seen only 39 fines issued.</p> \n<p>Yet some heavily targeted areas with higher migrant populations or greater social housing density had relatively few cases. Police in Greater Dandenong, which has a high migrant population, issued 333 fines to 17 May despite there being only 15 cases recorded. Yarra, which despite being relatively affluent has a high proportion of social housing, saw 287 fines while recording only 29 cases.</p> \n<p>It has led to suggestions that areas with higher migrant and social housing populations have been unfairly targeted during the lockdown, and prompted calls for increased transparency around enforcement in the state.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere needs to be some explanation as to why we\u2019re seeing enhanced policing occurring in some of these areas,\u201d said Daniel Nguyen, an advocacy co-ordinator with the Police Accountability Project run by Flemington&nbsp;Kensington Community Legal Centre.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf it\u2019s not discrimination, OK, but let us know why. And this is the problem we\u2019re seeing. Without clear data it\u2019s difficult to dispel the valid concerns people do have that certain ethnic or cultural backgrounds are being more affected by these rules.\u201d</p> \n<p>Victoria police have issued almost 6,000 fines for breaches of public health orders related to Covid-19 since they were introduced in mid-March. An analysis by the Age newspaper last month found the state had issued fines at <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/ahead-on-penalties-victoria-leads-nation-on-covid-19-lockdown-fines-20200527-p54x0d.html\">almost triple the rate of any other state or territory</a>. At $1,652, the fines are also harsher than any other state in Australia.</p> \n<p>At the same time, Victoria police have been less transparent around their use. While police in New South Wales have provided breakdowns of the location and reason for fines issued by police there, Victoria has up until now given scant detail about how the fines have been enforced.</p> \n<p>According to Nguyen, many of the concerns around the enforcement of Covid-19 laws speak to broader issues around policing in the state.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s similar in the sense that we don\u2019t have some of this data around ethnicity, age, and demographics so we don\u2019t have any sense of what\u2019s occurring around stop and search enforcement, for example,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe same sorts of issues we have with general day to day interactions between police and the public has only manifested itself in a broader context during Covid.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/06/fines-issued-during-covid-in-victoria/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In a hearing of the Victorian parliament\u2019s inquiry into the Covid-19 response, Victoria police commissioner Graham Ashton revealed at the time in mid-May, only 165 fines had been paid in full, while 337 had been cancelled, and another 437 were under review.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Just 37 of the fines issued were issued to businesses.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Ashton said the fines went through the same process as traffic fines when landing in Fines Victoria, to see if they would likely be overturned by court.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cThey have a good idea of where the court sets the bar, and so when they go through it they can then immediately see, \u2018Oh, this particular fine\u2019s not going to go through any sort of court review process satisfactorily\u2019 where the courts would see where the officers placed the discretion.\u201d</p> \n<p>The police minister, Lisa Neville, said those fines were off the back of 70,000 calls to the police assistance line, and 48,000 compliance checks, but couldn\u2019t say how many of the fines resulted from people calling the line.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cSo there would be a significant portion of them that have come from the police assistance line but not all of them, because some of them will be potentially people dobbing in people they do not like,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>The service was reportedly getting&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/police-hotline-swamped-with-covid-19-calls-as-victorians-dob-in-neighbours-20200408-p54i5g.html\">about 600 calls per day</a>.</p>"
