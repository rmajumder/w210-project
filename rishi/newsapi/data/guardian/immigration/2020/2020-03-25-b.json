  "<p>The All England Club will decide at an emergency meeting next week if it is advisable or even viable to hold this year\u2019s Wimbledon tournament, due to start on 29 June, but the mood is downbeat. The outgoing AELTC chief executive, Richard Lewis, said on Wednesday night the main board are \u201cworking hard to bring certainty to our plans\u201d, after much recent speculation.</p> <p>Lewis, who acknowledges a postponement would be difficult, said the club will consult with the game\u2019s main stakeholders \u2013 the LTA, ATP, WTA, ITF and the other three grand slams. He added: \u201cThe single most important consideration is one of public health, and we are determined to act responsibly through the decisions we make.\u201d</p> <p>Wimbledon, which sits perilously close to the prime minister\u2019s best-case forecast for a flattening out of coronavirus within 12 weeks, have abandoned plans to leave the decision until late April.</p> <p>\u201cWith such uncertainty about, changing big, long-term contracts and setting mutually acceptable new dates is difficult and complicated, as can be seen from what has been happening with the Olympics,\u201d said an insider with long experience of negotiating international TV sporting deals on Wednesday. \u201cFor that reason, I\u2019d say the chances of Wimbledon going ahead in June are slim to zero. You go with it now or you call it off.\u201d</p> <p>He said the same strategic thinking underpinned the decision this week by the Japanese government and the IOC <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/24/tokyo-olympics-to-be-postponed-to-2021-due-to-coronavirus-pandemic\" title=\"\">to postpone the Tokyo Olympics</a>. They originally announced they would decide within four weeks; ultimately, the call was forced on them within 24 hours. The new date for the Games, the source said, would be determined by an international sporting calendar that is set in stone \u2013 except, of course, when disrupted by something as unexpected and life-threatening as a global health crisis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/18/tennis-bodies-suspend-sport-until-7-june-with-sideswipe-at-french-open\">Tennis bodies suspend sport until 7 June with sideswipe at French Open</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt is a matter of finding a window,\u201d he said, \u201cand there aren\u2019t many of those for big sporting events. American TV, to a large extent, determines when a lot of these events can take place. It is not just about the tennis schedule. There is NFL, college sport, baseball, golf and, to a much lesser extent there, [ice] hockey, soccer and tennis.\u201d</p> <p>Against this background, and the quickening spread of Covid-19 \u2013 in reaction to which Roger Federer has donated one million Swiss francs to vulnerable families in Switzerland \u2013 there would seem to be dwindling belief within the All England Club that Wimbledon will escape postponement or even cancellation, as has been the case with practically every other sport.</p> <p>Sources say it is highly unlikely Wimbledon would seek to fill the gap created by the postponement of the Olympic Games. The thinking is that it is safer \u2013 and more convenient \u2013 to stick with the existing arrangements, however perilous in terms of planning, than disturb a system that has been in place for years. </p> <p>Time is not on their side given the scale of the operation. It takes up to two months to get the site ready for the championships so, realistically, a decision needs to be made by the end of April or the start of May at the latest. The chances of a return to normality in that timeframe do not look promising. It may be tempting for the AELTC to switch its efforts to its expansion across the road from the main grounds on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/oct/10/wimbledon-tennis-73-acres-wimbledon-park-golf-club\" title=\"\">newly acquired Wimbledon Park Golf Club</a>.</p> <p>Early visitors to Wimbledon will know how close to their deadline contractors have to go in setting up everything from corporate marquees to the many shops dotted around the grounds, as well as parking provisions and security. Wimbledon is, in effect, a small town that comes to life for a fortnight once a year.</p> <p>So, while officially the AELTC is still monitoring the situation, there is acknowledgment the sporting landscape remains too volatile \u2013 in the UK and globally \u2013 for an event as big as Wimbledon to commit to definitely going ahead.</p> <p>The difficulties in moving Wimbledon deeper into the tennis schedule became obvious nearly two weeks ago when the French Tennis Federation (FFT) decided unilaterally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/17/french-open-tennis-postponed-until-late-september-due-to-coronavirus\" title=\"\">to reposition its championships</a> away from the crisis high-point of the spreading virus in May to the supposedly safer waters of September.

Among other considerations, this seeks to protect its insurance claims given it can argue the decision has been taken out of its hands.</p> <p>Nonetheless, if, as Boris Johnson says, it will take at least three months for coronavirus to noticeably start fading, the odds on Wimbledon going ahead in June are surely indeed \u201cslim to zero\u201d.</p>",

Officials in Spanish regions such as Madrid and Catalonia initially dealt with a shortage of testing resources by asking people with mild symptoms to simply self-isolate, while Italy\u2019s top coronavirus response official, Angelo Borrelli, has suggested the real number of infections there is probably 10 times higher than the official count.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54962685ec5c4b9978e171f69a24c5443ce1de3f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54962685ec5c4b9978e171f69a24c5443ce1de3f/0_244_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An almost empty street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An almost empty street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bryan R Smith/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The accelerating pandemic \u2013 it took 67 days to reach the first 100,000 cases and four days to hit the latest 100,000, according to the WHO \u2013 has led to an estimated 1.7 billion people being ordered to remain at home around the world.</p> \n<p>In the US, where infections have passed the 55,000 mark and more than 800 people have died, legislators reached a deal on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/senate-passes-coronavirus-stimulus-package\">$2tn (\u00a31.85tn) rescue package</a> on Wednesday, the biggest bailout in US history.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"cadefc22-6bff-4cf8-adce-c413778f0d4b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qCyyfquAJgU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In New York \u2013 home to nearly half of the confirmed cases in the US \u2013 the shuttering of bars, restaurants, clubs and gyms may have helped slow the rate of hospitalisation in recent days, the state\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, said on Wednesday.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/coronavirus-us-new/map\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cNow that is almost too good to be true ...

  "<p>Gunmen and suicide bombers have killed at least 25 worshippers, including women and children, and injured many others in an early morning attack on a Sikh Gurdwara in the heart of Kabul.</p> <p>The attack lasted hours as the gunmen held hostages on Wednesday while Afghan special forces and international troops tried to end the siege in a complex that is home to many families, as well as a place of worship.</p> <p>Narender Singh Khalsa, a member of parliament who represents the Sikh community, told Reuters that there were three attackers, who arrived when the buildings were full of worshippers. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis\">Islamic State</a>, which has targeted Sikhs in Afghanistan before, said it carried out the attack.</p> <p>Up to 200 people were trapped inside the temple when the attack began at about 7am, interrupting worship that had started an hour earlier. The attackers reportedly threw grenades, and after bursting into the complex, started shooting indiscriminately.</p> <p>\u201cThe attackers arrived on the stairs and started killing the women. My nephew shouted and said to me \u2018Uncle, please go downstairs\u2019, and when I tried to go downstairs, they shot my nephew in the head,\u201d said Harander Singh, who lost several other relatives including his wife, father and daughter.</p> <p>\u201cMy dearest daughter was wounded, and she was repeatedly calling me \u2018Dad\u2019 before she died,\u201d he told Reuters, through tears.</p> <p>The attack was condemned internationally and across much of Afghan society.</p> <p>\u201cMy colleague Meharwan Singh lost his uncle and 20 friends, including two children and four women, in this appalling terrorist crime today,\u201d said Nader Nadery, a top civil servant and presidential adviser, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/N_Nadery/status/1242822644564713472?s=20\">on Twitter</a>. \u201cI share his pain and outrage.\u201d</p> <p>Afghanistan\u2019s tiny Sikh community is one of few religious minorities in the country, protected by law but frequently targeted by extremists and subject to discrimination.</p> <p>Thirty years ago it was 500,000 strong, but after decades of conflict and the rise of the Taliban \u2013 who ordered Sikhs to wear yellow armbands \u2013 many have sought asylum in India and the community is thought to have been reduced to about 300 families.</p> <p>In 2018 a convoy of Sikhs and Hindus travelling to meet the president, Ashraf Ghani, was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-44677823\">targeted by an Islamic suicide bomber</a>. The massacre on Wednesday was the second Isis attack on a religious minority in March; a gathering of the predominantly Shia Hazara ethnic minority was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/06/dozens-killed-in-attack-on-political-rally-in-kabul\">also attacked earlier this month</a>, with more than 30 people killed.</p> <p>As news of the latest attack broke, a spokesman for the Taliban, which recently signed a withdrawal deal with the US government and is moving towards intra-Afghan talks, was quick to deny any responsibility in the killings.</p> <p>Afghan officials and Taliban leaders met for several hours of talks on Wednesday and are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/suhailshaheen1/status/1242833687424774150\">expected to start</a> a prisoner release programme next week.

His headline announcement related to the NHS \u201cvolunteer army\u201d, but what was equally interesting was the defensiveness that seems to be creeping in to his public statements about coronavirus. He did not have a proper answer at all to Gary Gibbon\u2019s questions about why coronavirus testing in the UK was not as thorough as in some other countries, and he opened his statement with the words \u201cfrom the very beginning of this crisis I have followed the advice of our world-leading scientists\u201d - which did sound a little like someone starting to make excuses.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson said that more than 400,000 people had expressed interest in joining<a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/2020/03/your-nhs-needs-you-nhs-call-for-volunteer-army/\"> the NHS \u201cvolunteer army\u201d announced yesterday.</a> </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When we launched the appeal last night we hoped to get 250,000 over a few days.</p> \n   <p>But I can tell you that in just 24 hours 405,000 people have responded to the call.</p> \n   <p>They will be driving medicines from pharmacies to patients.</p> \n   <p>They will be bringing patients home from hospital.</p> \n   <p>Very importantly they\u2019ll be making regular phone calls to check on and support people who are staying on their own at home.</p> \n   <p>And they will be absolutely crucial in the fight against this virus.</p> \n   <p>That is already \u2013 in one day \u2013 as many volunteers as the population of Coventry.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, blamed global shortages for the fact that they government was not carrying out more coronavirus tests. </strong>He was responding to a question from Channel 4 News <strong>Gary Gibbon, </strong>who asked why the UK was \u201cso woefully behind other countries\u201d when it came to testing. In response, Johnson did not provide an explanation, but insisted that the UK was ahead of some other EU countries and that testing was being ramped up. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are going up from 5,000 to 10,000 tests per day, to 25,000, hopefully very soon up to 250,000 per day. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Whitty addressed the question more directly. He said global shortages explained why there were not enough test kits. At the moment it was not possible to test NHS staff and others who were self-isolating, he said. He went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This is a global problem. Basically, every country is wanting this new test for a disease that wasn\u2019t actually being tested for anywhere three months ago. So everybody wants, so there is a global shortage, and that\u2019s a bottleneck for us ...</p> \n   <p>There are multiple components in these tests, including the chemicals that make them up, the swabs that you use, and there are shortages along many of these supply chains, essentially because every county in the world is simultaneously wanting this new thing. Some components of this are old, but the scale of this is something which has obviously occurred at an extraordinary speed. And that\u2019s just a practical reality. Anyone who understands how supply chains work, and the huge demand for this globally, would understand that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson confirmed that the government might introduce wartime-style legislation to outlaw profiteering during the coronavirus crisis.</strong> Asked about the problem, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I dislike it very much and I do not want to see people profiteering, exploiting people\u2019s need at a critical time, in a national emergency.</p> \n   <p>We are indeed looking very carefully at what is going on.</p> \n   <p>The Competition and Markets Authority already has various powers that it may use but are looking at the legislative framework to see what it may be necessary to do to prevent profiteering just as happened in war time many years ago.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Whitty said the coronavirus peak would be \u201cprobably manageable\u201d for the NHS if people kept to the lockdown rules</strong>.

This is because they have limited reserves, constrained borrowing powers, and the funding flowing to them as a result of the Barnett formula may not reflect the challenges that they face. As a result, their ability to respond effectively may be delayed or compromised, and vital funding misallocated across the UK.

Ferguson\u2019s views are important because he was the lead author on<a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf\"> the Imperial College paper</a> that persuaded the government to drastically escalate its social distancing strategy.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Ferguson said that he and his colleagues were now \u201creasonably confident\u201d that the NHS would be able to cope with the coronavirus epidemic. </strong>That was partly because the NHS had surged its capacity, and partly because of the suppression measures taken by the government, he said.<br></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There will be some areas that are extremely stressed but we are reasonably confident - which is all we can be at the current time - that at the national level we will be within capacity ...</p> \n   <p>If the current measures work as we would expect them then we will see intensive care demand peak in approximately two to three weeks and then decline thereafter.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said he would expect the strain on the NHS to peak in about three weeks\u2019 time. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If the current measures work as we would expect them to, then we will see intensive care unit demand peak in approximately two and a half to three weeks\u2019 time, and then decline thereafter. </p> \n   <p>The reason for that lag is because it takes people something like two to three weeks from being infected to being in an intensive care unit. So the measures put in place last week, intensified this week, we think will have had a significant effect on transmission. But it takes that time for it to propagate through to healthcare demand.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said he expected up to 10% of the population in London to get coronavirus.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that, as countries around the world relaxed the suppression measures they would impose, they would have to rely on other strategies such as testing and contact tracing. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We clearly cannot lock down the country for a year.</p> \n   <p>The challenge that many countries in the world are dealing with is how we move from an initial intensive lockdown ... to something that will have societal effects but will allow the economy to restart.</p> \n   <p>That is likely to rely on very large-scale testing and contact tracing.

This week the government said that businesses involved in non-essential work should close and tonight parliament itself is due to shut down, with MPs starting the Easter recess one week earlier than expected. <strong>Jacob Rees-Mogg,</strong> the leader of the Commons, has tabled a motion on today\u2019s order paper to that effect. The recess won\u2019t start until the coronavirus bill has been passed, but it is due to clear its final stages in the Lords later this afternoon. The decision to adjourn early comes as no great surprise, but it is yet one more sign of the way the coronavirus outbreak has upended all aspects of normal life.</p> \n  <p>This move means that today will be Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s last PMQs as Labour leader. In other circumstances this would have been a big moment, but today attention will be elsewhere.</p> \n  <p>The early adjournment obviously is not intended as a comment on parliament\u2019s usefulness, and today we should see some good examples of how MPs perform a vital scrutiny function. PMQs will mark the first time Boris Johnson has taken questions from anyone since he delivered his unprecedented lockdown directive on Monday night. And this morning there are two potentially important committee hearings, the highlight of which will be Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, being questioned by the science committee. Some have claimed that the experts are really running the country at the moment and, appropriately enough, Vallance is up at 12pm - the same time as PMQs.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea9f2b0569c1a3d014ee3de5ce67940dc469bed4\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea9f2b0569c1a3d014ee3de5ce67940dc469bed4/0_0_746_240/500.jpg\" alt=\"Adjournment motion\" width=\"500\" height=\"161\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adjournment motion</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: House of Commons</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> \n  <p><em>9.30am: </em>Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, the work and pensions secretary, gives evidence to the Commons work and pensions committee about coronavirus.</p> \n  <p><em>10.15am: </em>Prof Neil Ferguson, director of the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College gives evidence to the Commons science committee about coronavirus.

  "<p>Britain\u2019s deputy ambassador to Hungary, Steven Dick, has died in Budapest after contracting coronavirus. Dick, 37, died on Tuesday, according to a Foreign Office statement on Wednesday afternoon.</p> <p>\u201cSteven was a dedicated diplomat and represented his country with great skill and passion. He will be missed by all those who knew him and worked with him,\u201d said the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab.</p> <p>Dick joined the FCO in 2008 and had previously been posted to Kabul and Riyadh. He took up his posting in Budapest last autumn after undergoing a year of full-time intensive Hungarian language training. He was well-liked on the diplomatic circuit in the city and was friendly, sociable and enthusiastic about his work.</p> <p>He had recently returned to Budapest from a holiday in Mexico, and early last week he said in a WhatsApp message that he had contracted coronavirus and was in isolation, but was feeling fine except for being bored.</p> <p>Local sources said he had been treated at a hospital in Budapest in recent days. It appears his condition deteriorated rapidly.

This is particularly important given the aggressive fiscal stimulus from European and Asian governments in the past two weeks. The US government needs to be seen as not just counting on the Fed to do all the heavy lifting, especially when cutting rates and providing liquidity alone are not sufficient to help businesses and households to get through such tough times.</p> <p> \u201cThe key question is whether these policies will be enough to facilitate a rebound once the virus is contained and shutdowns are removed. To answer this question we are following the employment data closely. If government policies prevent people from losing their jobs then a bounce back looks feasible. We are more confident that the stimulus policies put in place in Europe will adequately support employment. We suspect - and believe the jobless claims data out tomorrow will testify - that US unemployment is already on the rise which will prolong the period of weakness.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-25T08:08:30.476Z\">at 8.08am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e7b0dac8f08af215f6fac06\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-25T07:53:30.289Z\">7.53am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Recruitment firm <strong>Staffline </strong>reports that the UK jobs market has been changed dramatically, if maybe only temporarily, by Covid-19.</p> <p>It told the City this morning....</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is a marked increase in demand in the food sector, including food processing, logistics and supermarkets....</p> <p>Conversely, demand from other sectors such as retail, automotive and manufacturing has diminished considerably with the Group\u2019s limited exposure to white collar and permanent recruitment also impacted. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e7b0a2d8f081e5eda236474\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-25T07:46:08.317Z\">7.46am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Rentokil hit by Covid-19</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40b1190da27cc6ffedfdfbe78af93ca50e92982c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40b1190da27cc6ffedfdfbe78af93ca50e92982c/0_33_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rentokil worker in a red hat\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Pest control firm Rentokil has warned the City that the coronavirus is having a much deeper impact on its firm than previously thought.</strong></p> <p>It says that \u201cin the last 10 days the outbreak has escalated rapidly impacting businesses around the globe in an unprecedented manner\u201d. </p> <p>This has forced Rentokil to withdraw its previous profit guidance for 2020, as the company cannot predict the impact of Covid-19 on its business.

There have been 60 reported deaths so far.</p> \n<p>About a third of the cases are in South Africa, which recorded a steep rise overnight. The country\u2019s health minister, Zweli Mkhize, said on Wednesday that the number of coronavirus cases had reached 709, up from 554 a day before.</p> \n<p>South Africa will go into a strict 21-day lockdown at midnight on Thursday in an attempt to avoid a \u201ccatastrophe of huge proportions\u201d, said the president, Cyril Ramaphosa.

All restaurants, fast-food outlets, pubs, bars and taverns will be shut and transportation of alcohol is banned.</p> \n<p>Bheki Cele, the police minister, said anyone thinking of ignoring the restrictions, faced six months in prison, a fine or both, and warned that two people have already been charged with attempted murder for refusing to obey orders to self-isolate.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou buy food and go and cook it at home.

The first case has been reported in Libya.</p> \n<p>Most African nations have imposed restrictions and taken a range of extraordinary measures to try to combat the crisis. Many flights have been suspended, with entries for travellers from much of Europe and the US effectively impossible.</p> \n<p>Rwanda, Kenya and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have all imposed curfews and lockdowns in recent days.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.nation.co.ke/news/Corona-Virus-Update-Kenya/1056-5503860-kw92u4/index.html\">President Uhuru Kenyatta </a>said that he and other top Kenyan officials would forego much of their salaries, and announced a package of support for one of Africa\u2019s most dynamic economies.</p> \n<p>Authorities in the DRC, which has recorded 48 cases, are seeking to isolate the capital, Kinshasa, from the rest of the country, while Ethiopia is to release more than 4,000 prisoners in an effort to decongest crowded jails, according to state media.</p> \n<p>Mali recorded its first cases on Wednesday.

  "<p>International cooperation on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/09/mysterious-source-of-illegal-ozone-killing-emissions-revealed-say-investigators\">ozone-depleting chemicals</a> is helping to return the southern jet stream to a normal state after decades of human-caused disruption, a study shows.</p> <p>Scientists say the findings prove there is the capacity to heal some damaged climate systems if governments act promptly and in coordination to deal with the causes.</p> <p>The southern jet stream is a powerful wind that shapes weather patterns and ocean currents in the southern hemisphere, particularly in the summer.</p> <p>Up until about 2000 it had been shifting from its usual course and moving southwards towards the Antarctic at a rate of one degree of latitude each decade, affecting storm tracks and rainfall over South America, east Africa and Australia.</p> <p>Previous research has shown this was primarily driven by the depletion of the ozone layer by manmade chemical compounds such as chlorofluorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, found in fridges, aerosols and other industrial processes.</p> <p>These chemicals, which were used in vast quantities until they started to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/20/how-to-stop-the-climate-crisis-six-lessons-from-the-campaign-that-saved-the-ozone\">phased out</a> under the United Nations 1987 <a href=\"https://ozone.unep.org/treaties/montreal-protocol\">Montreal protocol </a>, thinned the ozone layer, causing a widening \u201chole\u201d high above the south pole that affected wind patterns.</p> <p>The new paper, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2120-4\">published in the journal Nature</a>, shows that the Montreal protocol has paused the southward movement of the jet stream since the turn of the century and may even be starting to reverse it as the ozone hole begins to close. Last September, satellite images <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/2019-ozone-hole-is-the-smallest-on-record-since-its-discovery\">revealed</a> the ozone hole annual peak had shrunk to 16.4m sq km, the smallest extent since 1982.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a success story. This is more evidence that the Montreal protocol has led to the recovery of the ozone layer,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author, Antara Banerjee, who works in the chemical sciences division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and is a visiting fellow at the University of Boulder, Colorado.</p> <p>The expected effect on people will vary from region to region. In Patagonia (southern Chile and Argentina), there should be more rain and less carcinogenic ultra-violet light. The findings will be of more concern for central South America (Uruguay, Paraguay, southern Brazil and northern Argentina), where ozone depletion was previously <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-013-1777-x#Sec21\">found</a> to bring more rainfall and wider bands of agricultural production. The same may also be true of east Africa and other desert areas in the mid-latitudes.</p> <p>Previous <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2201\">studies</a> suggest the reversal may also be good news for Australia, which has suffered more drought because the movement of the jet stream pushed rain-bearing storms away from its coast during winter. Whether this is enough to offset the rise in carbon emissions is another matter.</p> <p>The restoration of ozone is not enough to push southern hemisphere weather patterns back on to a normal track because other industrial emissions \u2013 such as carbon dioxide and methane \u2013 continue to exert a disruptive force in the opposite direction.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a tug of war between ozone recovery and increasing CO<sub>2</sub>. That\u2019s why we are seeing a pause. In the near future, the ozone factor could dominate and the jet stream will move back towards equator. But once the recovery is complete, CO<sub>2</sub> could push it southwards again,\u201d Banerjee said.</p> <p>Alexey Karpechko, a reviewer of the paper who works for the Finnish Meteorological Institute, said the paper illustrated how ozone depletion had been the main driver in atmospheric circulation.</p> <p>\u201cThis is good news, definitely. It shows our actions can stop climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can see coordinated action works. It is a strong message to us as emitters of greenhouse gases. This shows we can manipulate the climate both ways: in a wrong way and by reversing the damage we have done.\u201d</p> <p>Whether this will affect the loss of Antarctic sea ice remains a major unanswered question. Previous studies suggested the ozone hole had a chimney-like effect that sucked some of the heat out of the atmosphere, which meant the south pole warmed more slowly than the north. But Banerjee said such a view was controversial and required further study.</p>",

  "<p>Stringent new international restrictions on movement introduced because of the coronavirus pandemic are threatening the lives of millions of people across the world already caught up in humanitarian emergencies.</p> <p>UN agencies, aid groups and international experts have warned that the new restrictions, which have closed borders and ports, and severely limited the movement of key staff from Africa to South America and Asia, threaten a \u201cdramatic\u201d knock-on effect in countries suffering from conflict, extreme climate events and other crises.</p> <p>Lola Castro, regional director of the World Food Programme (WFP) for southern Africa, said the interruption of food programmes for millions of people in the 12 countries that they cover, which have experienced three years of poor harvests because of drought, would have a \u201ccritical impact\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf anyone says they are not worried about this, they are not across the issue,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The warning came as the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, launched a $2bn (\u00a31.7bn) coordinated global humanitarian response plan to fight Covid-19 in some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable countries, in a bid to protect millions of people and stop the virus from circling back around the globe.</p> <p>The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) reported that new coronavirus movement restrictions meant it was currently unable to reach thousands of people, including 300,000 in the Middle East.</p> <p>\u201cWhile governments are taking tough and much needed measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus, millions of refugees and displaced people still depend on humanitarian assistance. Aid workers should fall into the same category as medical staff, food retailers or pharmacists.</p> <p>\u201cIf supermarkets and pharmacies can remain operational during this crisis, then so should the delivery of humanitarian aid,\u201d said Jan Egeland, the NRC\u2019s secretary general.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Humanitarian organisations have already suspended relief programmes in some countries due to government restrictions, causing uncertainty and hardship for families.</p> <p>\u201cThe risk of Covid-19 spreading to overcrowded displacement sites in Asia, Middle East and parts of Africa is extremely high, and will lead to a humanitarian catastrophe if we can\u2019t protect those most at risk of infection,\u201d said Egeland.</p> <p>All of which has exacerbated fears that rising coronavirus cases in areas already in the grip of a humanitarian emergency could provoke a devastating \u201cdouble tap\u201d effect on the societies and people least able to deal with the pandemic, at a time when western donors are preoccupied with outbreaks in their own countries.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a real issue,\u201d said Vidya Diwakar, a researcher at the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) in London.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s the direct impact of the disease but there\u2019s also indirect impacts around border closures and logistics supply. We need to think about different ways of delivery, like mobile payments. But the catch is that many people in chronic poverty may not have access to mobiles.\u201d</p> <p>Andrew Shepherd, Diwakar\u2019s colleague at the ODI, said: \u201cThe other aspect of this is that this is a rapid onset disaster. We really have very little time given the weak health systems and food issues in many of these countries.</p> <p>\u201cA quick response is very important. One urgent question is how we are going to prioritise what is going to be a huge volume of need. How to prioritise people living in pre-existing crises and focus most energy on them.</p> <p>\u201cWe are talking about countries facing really difficult crises like natural disasters and climate extremes, and countries facing conflict. It is the reason the UN secretary general called this week for a global ceasefire.\u201d</p> <p>In South Africa, which has the largest number of reported cases on the continent and is the main humanitarian logistical centre for southern Africa, 35 out of 53 border posts have been closed or restricted even as agencies have sought exemptions for aid cargo shipments to continue.</p> <p>Even before the corona virus outbreak began in China in December, Castro explained, roughly 45 million people in the region were defined as food insecure, with 8.1 million relying on the WFP.</p> <p>\u201cThe lean season has been very, very hard for the past three years, with almost no rain and no harvest. We are also supporting some 4 million people every month in Zimbabwe. We are talking about millions who could be affected,\u201d Castro added.</p> <p>Elsewhere in Africa, new restrictions on entry for foreign staff into countries from South Sudan to the Democratic Republic of the Congo is also impacting day to day operations.</p> <p>It is not only Africa. Afghanistan has experienced a huge influx of citizens fleeing back from Iran, which is suffering one of the world\u2019s worst coronavirus outbreaks. That has come as Pakistan has closed its joint border crossings, which are the main route for aid into Afghanistan. Although the country is still allowing exemptions for cargo, the situation is being watched with concern.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/24/mogadishus-refugees-waiting-for-death-as-covid-19-reaches-somalia\">Mogadishu's refugees 'waiting for death' as Covid-19 reaches Somalia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Bangladesh, which is host to an estimated 900,000 Rohingya refugees who fled from neighbouring Myanmar, the government has asked aid groups not to bring in new staff, and to limit travel between the camps and the nearby town of Cox\u2019s Bazar, according to aid workers who spoke to the New Humanitarian website.</p> <p>\u201cIf aid workers aren\u2019t allowed to scale up urgent services because of lockdowns or stay-at-home orders, vital supplies will run out and displaced people will have their lifelines cut off,\u201d said Egeland, reinforcing the point.</p> <p>\u201cWe are asking governments to allow us to stay and deliver so that we can assist and protect the most vulnerable before it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p> <p>Castro added that, with coronavirus cases mounting in southern Africa, her agency would have to adapt rapidly.</p> <p>\u201cFor our teams in the field and our beneficiaries, we have to totally change our distribution models,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to reduce the concentration of people at distribution points, introduce handwashing facilities and make sure we have protective equipment.</p> <p>\u201cWe then need to over come border closings, airlines closures, ports becoming affected.

  "<p>An eerie quiet had descended over a city usually overflowing with chaos on Wednesday morning. As Delhi residents woke on the first day of a three-week nationwide lockdown imposed on India\u2019s population of 1.3 billion people in an attempt to halt the spread of the coronavirus, it was to a capital that was a ghost of its former self.</p> \n<p>Gone was the wall-to-wall traffic, the overcrowded alleyway fruit and vegetable markets, the auto-rickshaws, the chai wallahs, the <em>chaat</em> stalls, the bicycles piled high with wicker baskets and the overcrowded temples, mosques and gurdwaras. Highways were empty and roads lined with police and paramilitary officers and checkpoints. Chalk circles were drawn on the ground outside grocery shops and hospitals for people queuing to stand in to ensure they kept a healthy distance apart.</p> \n<p>Many also awoke to the reality of three weeks of hardship they were not sure they would be able to survive. More than 300 million people in India live below the poverty line, often living a hand to mouth existence as daily-wage workers with nothing in reserve to keep them going.</p> \n<p>Ram Yadav, 55, a rickshaw driver in north Delhi, lives in a room he shares with four others at a cost of 1,000 rupees (\u00a311) a month. He said he was overcome with anxiety at not being able to earn money for at least three weeks, if not more. \u201cI have to pay for my room, pay rent for my rickshaw, and I have family back home who are waiting for me to send money, but I don\u2019t know how I will do that and also survive.

The country has only 40,000 ventilators, one doctor per 11,600 people, one hospital bed per 1,826 people and one isolation bed per 84,000 people. The number of coronavirus cases is still low compared with Europe and the US, with just over 500 people infected and 10 deaths, but testing is also markedly behind other countries. Only about 17,000 tests have been carried out.</p> \n<p>\u201cIndia can not take any chances now,\u201d said Bhramar Mukherjee, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health who leads a team studying the spread of the coronavirus around the world. \u201cEven with the projected best-case scenarios, the already overstretched healthcare system will definitely collapse. There will be fatalities and deaths.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe need to increase testing, think of pragmatic surveillance strategies. We need to brace ourselves and prepare for a long haul.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But in a densely populated country where personal space is a luxury, the edict from the prime minister, Narendra Modi, calling for physical distancing and people to \u201cforget what going out means\u201d seemed like an almost impossible and unenforceable demand. Communal spaces form the basis of Indian society, three generations of a family tend to live together or next door, millions gather together in temples, mosques and gurdwaras on a daily basis and 64 million people live in overcrowded and insanitary slums.</p> \n<p>There are signs that India is already buckling under the weight of the increasing coronavirus caseload. A junior doctor in Kolkata who works in a state hospital where infected patients are being treated, and spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, said the four doctors in his hospital had been forced to work without the special personal protection equipment kits recommended by the World Health Organization because the authorities had not ordered them.</p> \n<p>\u201cLike many other doctor and paramedic colleagues and friends I worry that there is a high chance that I have already been infected and perhaps remained asymptomatic,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is extremely stressful for me while I am still working as a doctor among the patients.</p> \n<p>\u201cAfter working directly among the corona suspects I am sure of one thing, that unless the authorities bring more population under test we will not be able to curb or stop the spread of the infection. Lots of people who are potential carriers are not being tested even after they turned up at hospitals with some symptoms. Many others are not even reporting to the hospitals.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"55be248e53a702e8733dd88a28f3290a2e17804e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55be248e53a702e8733dd88a28f3290a2e17804e/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Firefighters disinfect the grounds of a hospital in Mumbai\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Firefighters disinfect the grounds of a hospital in Mumbai.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Prashant Waydande/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It was a similarly chaotic picture in the state of Bihar, which is dealing with around 50 coronavirus cases. Bihar also reported its first death at the weekend, a man who had recently returned from Qatar. Dr Ajay Kumar Bharti, the chief medical officer at Sadar hospital, where the man died, said they were ill-equipped to treat coronavirus patients safely. \u201cWe don\u2019t have surgical masks available right now and hence have ordered a local tailor shop to stitch 5,000 masks made of clothes and make them available soon,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Before lockdown was imposed, state borders began to close and India\u2019s railways, which usually carry 23 million passengers a day, shut down, tens of thousands of migrant workers returned to their villages from states such as Kerala and Maharashtra, the current centres of India\u2019s outbreak, raising fears of an already uncontrollable spread.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe available bed facility at government hospitals is not adequate,\u201d said the prominent Indian health expert Dr Rajiv Rajan. \u201cThe situation will turn alarming if we move into stage three and the patients start flooding the hospitals.\u201d</p> \n<p>For the people of Jammu and Kashmir however, Modi\u2019s announcement on Tuesday evening was met with a familiar dread and panic. Lockdowns have long been part of their way of life and since Modi revoked the state\u2019s special status last October and split it in two, they have endured a six-month crackdown which has crippled many essential services, including healthcare.</p> \n<p>As a result, Kashmir\u2019s healthcare system does not have enough manpower or machinery to deal with the outbreak.

  "<p>Last week, my friends and I were squeezed into a booth at Heyn\u2019s, an ice cream shop in Iowa City. While the coronavirus was on everyone\u2019s mind \u2013 we were liberally spritzing from my home-made bottle of hand sanitizer - hardcore social distancing had not descended upon the town yet.</p> <p>As we ate our cups of butter brickle, I felt Aimee stiffen by my side. She pointed her chin at the door, her face a mask of distress. I followed her gaze to see a little boy wholeheartedly licking the doorknob. We watched in horrified fascination.</p> <p>\u201cThis is what happens,\u201d Aimee sighed, \u201cWhen you spare the rod.\u201d</p> <p>That was our last \u201cin real life\u201d night together. After we elbowed our way out the door and hugged goodbye, the University of Iowa moved classes online and we tucked ourselves, reluctantly, into our respective homes.</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s up for a virtual happy hour?\u201d Marisa texted the group a few days later.</p> <p>\u201cIn!\u201d we said, thoroughly sick of our own company. After a lot of back and forth about platforms, I suggested we download Houseparty.</p> <p>Houseparty had gotten a lot of attention among the under-24 set when it first started back in 2016. Its CEO, Sima Sistani, touted it as the \u201cnext best thing to hanging out in real life\u201d. It had been installed by 35 million users (40% of whom were outside the US.) In subsequent years, however, downloads of the app had declined \u2013 that is, until the pandemic. Downloads in March 2020 were the highest of the year. Twitter confirmed Houseparty\u2019s re-emergence into public consciousness: \u201cEveryone is back on Houseparty. It\u2019s 2017 again.\u201d \u201cMake Houseparty great again!\u201d \u201cWho\u2019s down to get Houseparty again and get this social distancing lit?\u201d</p> <p>Ready to get literally anything lit, I persuaded everyone to download the app and meet up in an hour. I brought out the wine, sent my new username out and waited. Slowly people started popping up on my phone screen. We broke into smiles and all started speaking at once. The audio immediately became a garbled mess.</p> <p>\u201cDammit!\u201d I shouted. \u201cY\u2019all broke Houseparty!\u201d</p> <p>The audio did smooth out shortly after, but kept dropping intermittently, probably due to my slow internet. This might have been a blessing, as I believe I missed a whole section about how Ian didn\u2019t use soap in the shower.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What we are really finding out from this coronavirus is what everyone\u2019s news source is</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cJust a vigorous blast on the pits\u201d is all I heard.</p> <p>\u201cVox said this is gonna last 18 months,\u201d Jeremy said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we are really finding out from this coronavirus is what everyone\u2019s news source is,\u201d Aimee said. \u201cMine is y\u2019all.\u201d</p> <p>Jeremy tapped a pair of dice on top of the screen, that launched a trivia game. We all tapped fast and furious on answers to questions like: what was the name of Cady\u2019s high school in Mean Girls (Answer: North Shore.) There was a lot of yelling and laughter and then the game ended. I started thinking about dinner.</p> <p>\u201cI ordered a pizza last night,\u201d I said. \u201cWe drove to the pizza place but they didn\u2019t let us in. They asked us to roll down the window and threw the pizza at us.\u201d</p> <p>We laughed and for a brief moment it felt like we were all at the Dandy Lion again, joking over cheeseburgers. Shortly after, we signed off. It was dinnertime, tacos had to be made, soylent consumed.</p> <p>Seeing my friends via Houseparty didn\u2019t feel normal \u2013 not by a long shot \u2013 but it did seem to lift, somewhat, the isolation I was feeling. That glass (or two) of wine felt much better when it was shared, even if just on a screen. My friends agreed. (Well, all except the one who doesn\u2019t use soap.) The games were too easy, he thought.</p> <p>\u201cYou try being a competitive virtual playground in the age of corona,\u201d Jeremy joked.</p> <p>Games notwithstanding, faced with an indefinite period of social distancing, I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019ll all jump back on to Houseparty in a day or so.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Another doctor, Charles from west Africa, who did complete the medical conversion exams and is practising in the UK, is doing research into some aspects of Covid-19 with colleagues in the US. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at trying to prevent some of the complications of Covid-19 such as lung fibrosis,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>He added that part of the GMC conversion exams for overseas doctors known as <a href=\"https://www.gmc-uk.org/registration-and-licensing/join-the-register/plab\">Plab 1 and Plab 2</a> \u2013 Professional and Linguistic Assessment Board \u2013 focus on the nuances of the English language rather than on medical expertise. They cost \u00a3230 and \u00a3840 respectively, and courses medics must take before sitting these exams can cost in the region of \u00a32,000 and upwards.</p> \n<p>\u201cI was listening to the BBC 24/7 to perfect my English language to pass these exams,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was about techniques, about playing the game. If you are a qualified doctor you should be able to work in the UK during the pandemic.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cSo many overseas qualified doctors I know are driving Ubers or have opened takeaway restaurants because it\u2019s so difficult to get reaccredited here.

They are able and willing to play their part in tackling this pandemic,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThe veto on asylum seekers working is outrageous. If we have asylum seekers who are qualified doctors why not bring them forward?\u201d</p> \n<p>Anna Jones of <a href=\"https://refuaid.org\">RefuAid</a>, which supports refugee healthcare specialists and other professionals into employment with loans for accredition and other things, has called on Hancock to fast-track fully qualified overseas doctors and nurses into NHS jobs.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have 230 doctors who are fully qualified in their own countries. Most have many years of experience as doctors. It can take these doctors 12 to 18 months to get their language qualifications and their Plab 1 and Plab 2 qualifications,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cA lot of these doctors have clinical experience in high-pressure, low-resource settings. I can understand that it\u2019s important to ensure that people\u2019s medical qualifications are legitimate. We have obtained copies of the doctors\u2019 qualifications from their home countries.\u201d</p> \n<p>Una Lane, the director for registration at the GMC, said: \u201cWe\u2019re working hard to help qualified doctors join the frontline to provide vital care to patients.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have always worked closely with refugee doctors and their representative organisations to help them register with us so that they can practise here and care for patients in the UK. We are continuing to do this but are also pointing them to advice from NHS England about roles that they could undertake that would not require registration or a licence to practise in the short term.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cRefugee doctors are eligible for discounts. We cover the fees for EPIC verification and offer two free attempts at Plab 1, with Plab 2 discounted to half price. The application fee can be paid in 10 instalments if requested.\u201d</p> \n<p>A government spokesperson said<strong>: </strong>\u201cWe are hugely grateful for the vital contributions that doctors are making in the national effort to tackle coronavirus, and are considering a wide range of further measures, at pace, as part of our response. There are no immigration checks for anyone requiring testing or treatment and they will be treated for free.\u201d</p>",

  "<p><em>The Schengen Agreement, signed on 14 June 1985, saw five countries agreeing to begin reducing internal border controls with the ultimate goal of allowing free movement with the Schengen area. It went into effect on 26 March 1995, with other nations soon joining.</em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/coronavirus-france-on-war-footing-as-europe-locks-down-macron\">EU brings in travel ban as France joins coronavirus lockdown</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Five sign border accord</h2> <p>by John Palmer<br>20 June 1990</p> <p>The joint action by Belgian and Dutch police in arresting five IRA suspects was hailed by the five European Community governments which yesterday signed an agreement in Luxembourg to abolish border controls. The signing ceremony in the hamlet of Schengen, involving ministers from Belgium, France, Holland, Luxembourg and Germany, is a step towards a 12-nation single European market without frontiers.</p> <p>But the agreement is regarded with suspicion by the British government.</p> <p>The agreement will allow development of a common police information system, and an understanding that police from the five states may pursue suspects across borders for up to 10 kilometres and, with the exception of France, make arrests. Britain continues to insist that only national border controls can assure action against criminals and terrorists.</p> <h2>Passport controls abolished in seven states as \u2018Schengenland\u2019 takes latest step towards integration</h2> <p>by Alex Bellos and John Carvel<br>27 March 1995</p> <p>British travellers to Schengenland are unlikely to notice much difference to their journeys. Holidaymakers driving on motorways between the seven countries which have signed the Schengen convention will not need to show their passports, but the implementation of the free-travel area brought little change at most land border crossing points, where immigration control had become sporadic over recent years.</p> <p>The latest step in European integration appeared to be going ahead smoothly at airports in the seven European Union member states where passport controls were abolished on flights between France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Spain and Portugal.</p> <p>The change, however, does not mean anyone can travel without a passport on the Continent. In each of the Schengen countries police can ask people to prove their identity with an identity card, which Britons do not have, or a passport.</p> <p>Only Britain is opposed in principle to abandoning border controls. Italy and Greece are members of Schengen and will abolish internal border controls when their external borders are secure. Austria is due to become a member next month. Denmark, Sweden and Finland want to join if they can preserve open borders with Norway and Iceland. Ireland has no objection in principle, but does not want to disturb the common travel area with Britain.</p> <p>Some observers fear an increase in random identity checks with the consequence that such checks are more annoying than having to show a passport at the border.</p> <p>New procedures are also likely on the external Schengenland border, where security is being strengthened, and this may affect the British traveller. At the Calais ferry terminal, for example, there may eventually be more passport checks \u2013 now cursory or non-existent \u2013 causing delays.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/05/is-the-schengen-dream-of-europe-without-borders-becoming-a-thing-of-the-past\">Is the Schengen dream of Europe without borders becoming a thing of the past?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the sleepy village of Schengen on the south-western tip of Luxembourg, where the plan was agreed in 1985, an abandoned customs house at the end of the bridge leading to Germany and France is no more than a cobwebbed relic of former national divisions.</p> <p>MEPs celebrating abolition of controls in Schengen yesterday were outnumbered by German and French motorists nipping over the border as usual to top up with cheap Luxembourg petrol and lower-duty alcohol and cigarettes.</p> <p>Queues may also form at ports and airports due to border guards accessing the elaborate Schengen computer network, built in a bombproof bunker in Strasbourg, which has already been loaded with 2 million data files on people, stolen cars and fake identity cards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a7519be7657fce25b2db498c470681245f2b8cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a7519be7657fce25b2db498c470681245f2b8cd/0_106_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An old custom post on the border between Belgium and France in Alveringem, Belgium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An old custom post on the border between Belgium and France in Alveringem, Belgium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fran\u00e7ois Lenoir/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The brave new world of a Europe without frontiers</h2> <p>by Ian Traynor<br>from Suben on the German and Austrian frontier<br>27 March 1995</p> <p>It is nigh impossible to find Schengen on a map of Europe, even harder than finding Maastricht. But for the border guards, politicians and officials who yesterday began policing the brave new world of a Europe Without Frontiers, Schengen is more than a village in Luxembourg.</p> <p>It\u2019s a country. \u201cIn Schengen you can travel from here uncontrolled right down to Portugal,\u201d said Josef Heisl, head of the German border police on this stretch of the frontier with Austria. It\u2019s a portent. \u201cA milestone on the way to a united Europe,\u201d said Manfred Kanther, Germany\u2019s interior minister.</p> <p>But for Tomasz, a Hungarian student driving to Cologne, it is a nuisance. \u201cThe Germans are always the same if you\u2019ve got a smart car. They\u2019re convinced it\u2019s stolen. Now they\u2019ve got this new system for tracing,\u201d he said as the Bavarian guard ordered his Opel Calibra aside while its details were fed into the Euro-computer.</p> <p>An hour earlier, a traveller\u2019s details were fed into the network. Back came the unwonted response that the French authorities had queries about the subject\u2019s residence permit.</p> <p>\u201cThere was no arrest warrant out for him,\u201d Mr Heisl explained. \u201cWe let him go. But we made a note of his details, address, and forwarded them to the French.\u201d</p> <p>Further north on the German-Polish border, a Pole trying to enter Germany was handcuffed and led away when the computer spat out the revelation that she was on France\u2019s wanted list.</p> <p>For the citizens of the seven countries participating in Schengen, most of western continental Europe is now entirely hassle-free when it comes to travelling. The corollary, of course, is that the external borders of \u201cSchengen\u201d get ever tighter.</p> <p>This was clear in Suben on the Danube yesterday. There was no doubt with whom Mr Heisl\u2019s guards were concerned. Austria is not yet part of Schengen, but Austrians milled back and forth unchecked. Every east European car had to pull aside.</p> <p>For its part, the Polish government reacted sniffily to the overtures of the Schengen beneficiaries. Bonn asked Warsaw to introduce a a fast lane for EU nationals. The Poles said no.</p> <p>Britain is less troubled by that prospect, having set its face against joining Schengen, fearing undesirables.</p> <p>Europe Without Frontiers should have started up two years ago under the Single European Act that provided for free movement of \u201cgoods, services, persons and capital\u201d. In negotiating the deal, Margaret Thatcher backed freedom for goods, services and capital, but objected to that for human beings.</p> <p>Glitches in the computer system, legal problems, and worries about criminals, illegal immigrants, drugs, plutonium and stolen cars have also held up Schengen. But new police powers are being framed to combat the risks, alarming civil libertarians.</p> <p>Under various bilateral agreements, national police forces can cross the border and, in certain cases, make arrests in another country.</p> <p>Mr Heisl is all for this: \u201cWe should bring in these powers everywhere. Now is the right time to do it. Politically, we might not get another chance. The criminals now have free rein in Schengen.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 8 April 2020.

  "<p>Did you notice? There was a moment when something shifted, and all topics of conversation besides Covid-19 started to sound trivial. Things will surely shift again, as people realise that the self-confinement could last and escapism becomes our collective goal, but for now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/08/misinformation-coronavirus-contagious-infections\">Adam Kucharski\u2019s</a> <em>The Rules of Contagion </em>is the book you might want to reach for. Not least \u2013 given that the present pandemic is very much in the ascendant \u2013 for its subtitle: <em>Why Things Spread \u2013 and Why They Stop.</em></p> <p>Kucharski, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, tells the story of the mathematical modelling of infectious disease, about which we have heard so much lately. The book\u2019s hero is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/aug/19/world-mosquito-day-114-years\">Ronald Ross</a>, the British doctor who in the late 19th century discovered that mosquitoes spread malaria and was rewarded with the 1902 Nobel prize in physiology or medicine.</p> <p>Ross wasn\u2019t the first to describe an epidemic mathematically, but he was the first to do so armed with a thorough understanding of the biological and social processes that shape it, and this made all the difference. Whereas others had looked backwards, observing how epidemics unfolded over time, he looked forwards, making predictions about the course of an outbreak and how various interventions might affect it. His ideas form the basis of modern disease modelling, and of our governments\u2019 strategies to combat Covid-19. It\u2019s partly thanks to Ross that we have the concept of herd immunity \u2013 hopeful because it means that not every mosquito has to be squashed, not every person has to be vaccinated, for a population to be protected against a disease.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9970cf1c988f48762c43f09bb8a18227905cb86a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9970cf1c988f48762c43f09bb8a18227905cb86a/0_232_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Red Cross worker pours a sanitising gel into a driver\u2019s hand in Dakar, Senegal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Red Cross worker pours a sanitising gel into a driver\u2019s hand in Dakar, Senegal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zohra Bensemra/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Epidemic is a Greek word meaning \u201con the people\u201d, and until Hippocrates requisitioned it to refer exclusively to the spread of a disease, the Greeks applied it to anything that percolated through a population \u2013 from fog to rumour to civil war. What\u2019s striking about Kucharski\u2019s tale is how we\u2019ve circled back to that pre-Hippocratic outlook. Ross and mathematician Hilda Hudson set the ball rolling when they folded their ideas about the spread of disease into a broader \u201ctheory of happenings\u201d, but they distinguished between \u201cdependent\u201d happenings, such as a contagious disease, and \u201cindependent\u201d happenings, which could not be passed from person to person. In the latter category they placed accidents, divorce and chronic diseases \u2013 the kind that kill most of us today.</p> <p>A century on, ideas have changed. Now the thinking is that many of the things that Hudson and Ross might have considered independent \u2013 obesity, smoking, even loneliness \u2013 are catching, too. We talk about financial contagion and epidemics of knife crime, and methods borrowed from public health are being applied to try to nip these problems in the bud, or at least slow their spread. Remember when Glasgow had the ignominious reputation of being the murder capital of Europe, known for its signature \u201cGlasgow smile\u201d? Then the Violence Reduction Unit was set up there in 2005, modelled on similar projects in the US, and the city\u2019s homicide rate was cut by two-thirds.</p> <p>Ross would be surprised, gratified and perhaps also slightly amused. The man who explained that a disease can only get a foothold in a population if new infections outnumber recoveries complained in his lifetime about how long it took for new thinking \u2013 his \u2013 to catch on. \u201cThe world requires at least 10 years to understand a new idea,\u201d he wrote, \u201chowever important or simple it may be.\u201d In the 21st century, everyone has got with the programme, including marketers whose goal is to ramp up the transmissibility of an idea or meme as far as they possibly can.

Marine ecologist George Sugihara was wooed away from his study of fish populations to build predictive models for Deutsche Bank. \u201cBasically,\u201d he observed later, \u201cI modelled the fear and greed of mobs that trade.\u201d Epidemiologist Gary Slutkin moved from public health in Africa to crime reduction in Chicago, and Kucharski himself interned at an investment bank in Canary Wharf before turning his attention to the spread of dengue fever and Zika virus disease in the Pacific. And on the theme of crossovers, he includes the pleasing anecdote that bookseller Thomas Guy got out of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/aug/10/featuresreviews.guardianreview1\">South Sea Company just before that particular bubble burst in 1720</a>, and used his profits to found Guy\u2019s Hospital in London. Isaac Newton wasn\u2019t so lucky. \u201cI can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies but not the madness of people,\u201d he allegedly said, after losing the equivalent of \u00a320m in today\u2019s money.</p> <p>One of the most interesting and topical parts of the book is about the mathematical modelling of fake news. We already knew this was contagious \u2013 albeit with its own specific mechanisms of contagion \u2013 but as we are seeing yet again, a pandemic of fake news can feed off, and interact with, a pandemic of infectious disease. Happily, the modellers are beginning to get a handle on how fake news spreads, and how to stop it, and their insights are already being translated into practice. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which now has Covid-19, polio and measles as well as Ebola, a third of the workforce involved in the Ebola response are social scientists whose job is to build bridges with local people, understand their thinking around the disease, and reinforce sound information while countering rumours.</p> <p>Memory, too, is contagious \u2013 and so is forgetting. We collectively forgot the worst catastrophe of the 20th century, the so-called \u201cSpanish\u201d flu that happened just over a century ago, and now it\u2019s all anyone can talk about. Will that revived memory outlast the new pandemic, or will it sink back into the sediment of our minds as soon as the danger has passed, and the social networks have moved on? It\u2019s too early to say, but one could argue that our long forgetting of that pandemic weakened our incentive for investing in healthcare systems and doing all the other things that public health experts have been urging us to do for decades, to prepare ourselves for the next one. A contagion of forgetting prompted a pandemic which prompted a contagion of remembering.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The world requires at least 10 years to understand a new idea, however important or simple it may be</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Modellers have a saying: \u201cIf you\u2019ve seen one pandemic, you\u2019ve seen \u2026 one pandemic.\u201d Covid-19 doesn\u2019t behave like flu, which doesn\u2019t behave like Ebola. The title of <em>The Rules of Contagion</em> refers to the things that are common to all pandemics \u2013 from the ice bucket challenge to bitcoin to infectious diseases \u2013 rather than those that are peculiar to each one. Modellers have spent the last century teasing out those rules, and now their conclusions are being put to the mother of all tests. This book explains how they arrived at them, and why they indicate that what each of us does next will make a difference. There may still be a lot of uncertainty around Covid-19, but one thing is clear: for Kucharski and his fellow modellers, it will be one more learning experience.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Laura Spinney\u2019s Pale Rider: The Spanish Flu of 1918 and How It Changed the World is published by Vintage.

His conclusion: it can be <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16907878\">safe to donate often</a>, if the antibody level of someone\u2019s blood is monitored closely \u2013 at a minimum, before every fifth donation. In the US, this test is routinely conducted every four months, with no minimum threshold. \u201cThe donor doesn\u2019t notice a drop of antibodies, but is far more at risk for infections. It\u2019s a trappy situation,\u201d Hellstern said.</p> \n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3001115/\">Paul Strengers</a> from the International Plasma Fractionation Association (IPFA), the loss of antibodies may have a highly deleterious effect on the immune system, and in the worst case could lead to potentially deadly infections like pneumonia. \u201cThis may include also any influenza virus but also the coronavirus,\u201d Strengers said, adding that there was no evidence so far of actual infections among high-frequency donors.</p> \n<p>In the plasma donation centers, donors the NDR/the Guardian talked to last month said they were not advised in advance of possible long-term health consequences.</p> \n<p>BPL Plasma did not respond to all of the questions asked by the Guardian and NDR but said in a statement: \u201cBPL collection centers operate in strict accordance with the FDA &amp; industry guidelines that exist to promote the safety of both plasma donors and the patients who use plasma derived therapeutics.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked about impact of Covid-19, BPL Plasma said this week that health and safety of staff and donors was their mission, adding: \u201cWe are closely monitoring guidelines issued by both federal and local authorities and are implementing enhanced safety protocols in our collection centers.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the UK, the maximum plasma donation allowance is 15 liters per person per year.

Asked about the discrepancy in donation frequencies permitted in the US versus the UK, the agency said it was a question for \u201crelevant US authorities\u201d.</p> \n<p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said its \u201cregulations have been established to ensure that a donor is in good health prior to donation\u201d, and added: \u201cWe recognize that regulators in other countries may reach different regulatory conclusions even when considering the same data.\u201d</p> \n<p>When asked about the high donation frequency, the PPTA, a private trade organization that represents the for-profit plasma-producing pharmaceutical companies in North America and Europe, said the plasma centers were meeting all FDA standards.</p> \n<h2><strong>Coronavirus</strong></h2> \n<p>A reduction in plasma donors because of the Covid-19 crisis could affect the supply chain of plasma shipments to the UK, and Europe, which imports around 40% of its blood plasma from the US. \u201cWe do expect the rapid spread of Covid-19 could adversely impact the supply of plasma,\u201d a BPL Plasma spokesperson said.</p> \n<p>Most European countries don\u2019t pay donors but rely on paid plasma donations imported from the US. As reporting by <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/pharmaceutical-companies-are-luring-mexicans-across-the-u.s.-border-to-donate-blood-plasma\">ARD German TV and ProPublica</a> has shown, border centers are the country\u2019s most lucrative collection centers, with the most high-frequency donors.</p> \n<p>To prevent shortages in times of the global pandemic, blood and plasma donation centers in Europe and the UK are now begging healthy donors to continue giving blood and plasma at home. Alexa Wetzel with PPTA told NDR/the Guardian: \u201cIt takes seven to 12 months to produce plasma medication. If the numbers of donations drop now, we will see effects within six or seven months.\u201d Plasma centers in the US and Europe are also taking several safety measures like creating distance between the donors and measuring fever before donations.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3bc5ae583c3f053f6511bd58dc0100c6966ee0b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3bc5ae583c3f053f6511bd58dc0100c6966ee0b/0_0_7415_4776/1000.jpg\" alt=\"donor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"644\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Most donors don\u2019t know if what they are doing is wrong in terms of the legality of using their visa for paid donations.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gabriela Campos/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Experts from health agencies, pharmaceutical companies and not-for-profit blood centers say the coronavirus does not affect the safety of plasma medication. \u201cCorona is a respiratory virus.

  "<p>We have been living in a bubble, a bubble of false comfort and denial. In the rich nations, we have begun to believe we have transcended the material world. The wealth we\u2019ve accumulated \u2013 often at the expense of others \u2013 has shielded us from reality. Living behind screens, passing between capsules \u2013 our houses, cars, offices and shopping malls \u2013 we persuaded ourselves that contingency had retreated, that we had reached the point all civilisations seek: insulation from natural hazards.</p> <p>Now the membrane has ruptured, and we find ourselves naked and outraged, as the biology we appeared to have banished <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/23/icu-doctors-tough-decisions-coronavirus-uk\">storms through our lives</a>. The temptation, when this pandemic has passed, will be to find another bubble. We cannot afford to succumb to it. From now on, we should expose our minds to the painful realities we have denied for too long.</p> <p>The planet has multiple morbidities, some of which will make this coronavirus look, by comparison, easy to treat. One above all others has come to obsess me in recent years: how will we feed ourselves? Fights over toilet paper are ugly enough: I hope we never have to witness fights over food. But it\u2019s becoming difficult to see how we will avoid them.</p> <p>A large body of evidence is beginning to accumulate showing how climate breakdown is likely to affect our food supply. Already farming in some parts of the world is being <a href=\"https://nexusmedianews.com/drought-is-crippling-small-farmers-in-mexico-with-consequences-for-everyone-else-photos-73b35a01e4dd\">hammered by drought</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/climate/farms-climate-change-crops.html\">floods</a>, <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/farmers-count-cost-of-fires-but-hopes-new-vintage-not-up-in-smoke-20191228-p53nbb.html\">fire</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/20/locust-crisis-poses-a-danger-to-millions-forecasters-warn\">locusts</a> (whose resurgence in the past few weeks appears to be the result of <a href=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/20032020/locust-swarms-climate-change\">anomalous tropical cyclones</a>). When we call such hazards \u201cbiblical\u201d, we mean that they are the kind of things that happened long ago, to people whose lives we can scarcely imagine. Now, with increasing frequency, they are happening to us.</p> <p>In his forthcoming book, <a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.co.uk/9780008308599/our-final-warning-six-degrees-of-climate-emergency/\">Our Final Warning</a>, Mark Lynas explains what is likely to happen to our food supply with every extra degree of global heating. He finds that extreme danger kicks in somewhere between 3C and 4C above pre-industrial levels. At this point, a series of interlocking impacts threatens to send food production into a death spiral. Outdoor temperatures become <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(18)30240-7/fulltext\">too high for humans to tolerate</a>, making subsistence farming impossible across Africa and South Asia. Livestock die from heat stress. Temperatures start to <a href=\"https://www.cbd.int/financial/2017docs/usa-climateagro.pdf\">exceed the lethal thresholds</a><a href=\"https://www.cbd.int/financial/2017docs/usa-climateagro.pdf\"> for crop plants</a> across much of the world, and major food producing regions turn into <a href=\"https://epic.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/nplants2016193.pdf\">dust bowls</a>. Simultaneous <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/115/26/6644\">global harvest failure</a> \u2013 something that has never happened in the modern world \u2013 becomes highly likely.</p> <p>In combination with a rising human population, and the loss of irrigation water, soil and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/19/us-beekeepers-lost-40-of-honeybee-colonies-over-past-year-survey-finds\">pollinators</a>, this could push the world into structural famine. Even today, when the world has a total food surplus, hundreds of millions are malnourished as a result of the unequal distribution of wealth and power. A food deficit could result in billions starving. Hoarding will happen, as it always has, at the global level, as powerful people snatch food from the mouths of the poor. Yet, even if every nation keeps <a href=\"http://paris-equity-check.org/warming-check\">its promises under the Paris </a><a href=\"http://paris-equity-check.org/warming-check\">agreement</a>, which currently seems unlikely, global heating will amount to between 3C and 4C.</p> <p>Thanks to our illusion of security, we are doing almost nothing to anticipate this catastrophe, let alone prevent it. This existential issue scarcely seems to impinge on our consciousness. Every food-producing sector claims that its own current practices are sustainable and don\u2019t need to change. When I challenge them, I\u2019m met with a barrage of anger and abuse, and threats of the kind I haven\u2019t experienced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/nov/26/foreignpolicy.iraq\">since I opposed the Iraq </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/nov/26/foreignpolicy.iraq\">war</a>. Sacred cows and holy lambs are everywhere, and the thinking required to develop the new food systems that we need, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/08/lab-grown-food-destroy-farming-save-planet\">lab-grown food, </a>is scarcely anywhere.</p> <p>But this is just one of our impending crises. Antibiotic resistance is, potentially, as deadly as any new disease. One of the causes is the astonishingly profligate way in which these precious medicines are used on <a href=\"http://www.saveourantibiotics.org/media/1773/farm-antibiotic-use-in-the-united-states.pdf\">many livestock farms</a>. Where vast numbers of farm animals are packed together, antibiotics are deployed prophylactically to prevent otherwise inevitable outbreaks of disease. In some parts of the world, they are used not only to prevent disease, but also as growth promoters. Low doses are routinely added to feed: a strategy that could scarcely be better designed to <a href=\"http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/136454/e94889.pdf\">deliver bacterial resistance</a>.</p> <p>In the US, where 27 million people have no medical cover, some people are now treating themselves with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/11/fish-antibiotics-human-use-cheaper-than-doctor\">veterinary antibiotics</a>, including those sold, without prescription, to medicate pet fish. Pharmaceutical companies are failing to invest sufficiently in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/mar/24/the-drugs-dont-work-what-happens-after-antibiotics\">search for new drugs</a>. If antibiotics cease to be effective, surgery becomes almost impossible. Childbirth becomes a mortal hazard once more. Chemotherapy can no longer be safely practised. Infectious diseases we have comfortably forgotten become deadly threats. We should discuss this issue as often as we talk about football. But again, it scarcely registers.</p> <p>Our multiple crises, of which these are just two, have a common root. The problem is exemplified by the response of the organisers of the <a href=\"https://bathhalf.co.uk/2020/03/covid-19-update/\">Bath Half Marathon</a>, a massive event that took place on 15 March, to the many people begging them to cancel. \u201cIt is now too late for us to cancel or postpone the event. The venue is built, the infrastructure is in place, the site and our contractors are ready.\u201d In other words, the sunk costs of the event were judged to outweigh any future impacts \u2013 the potential transmission of disease, and possible deaths \u2013 it might cause.</p> <p>The amount of time it took the International Olympic Committee to postpone the Games could reflect similar judgments \u2013 but at least they got there in the end.<strong> </strong>Sunk costs within the fossil fuel industry, farming, banking, private healthcare and other sectors prevent the rapid transformations we need. Money becomes more important than life.</p> <p>There are two ways this could go. We could, as some people have done, double down on denial. Some of those who have dismissed other threats, such as climate breakdown, also seek to downplay the threat of Covid-19. Witness the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/brazils-jair-bolsonaro-says-coronavirus-crisis-is-a-media-trick\">claims that the coronavirus is nothing more than \u201ca little flu\u201d</a>. The media and opposition politicians who have called for lockdown are, apparently, part of a conspiracy against him.</p> <p>Or this could be the moment when we begin to see ourselves, once more, as governed by biology and physics, and dependent on a habitable planet. Never again should we listen to the liars and the deniers. Never again should we allow a comforting falsehood to trounce a painful truth. No longer can we afford to be dominated by those who put money ahead of life. This coronavirus reminds us that we belong to the material world.</p> <p>\u2022 George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist</p>",

When I returned from my trip around Central Europe I isolated myself (in a borrowed apartment away from my mother and sister) since the number of cases of COVID-19 (in Germany for instance) were similar to Italy in the beginning. Around ten days ago I started feeling some symptoms, exactly the same time as my father - who traveled with me from Brussels. I was feeling tired, had shivers, a sore throat and coughed. My dad experienced the same symptoms, but much more intense and with a fever. In Sweden you can not test yourself for COVID-19 unless you\u2019re in need of emergent medical treatment. Everyone feeling ill are told to stay at home and isolate themselves. I have therefore not been tested for COVID-19, but it\u2019s extremely likely that I\u2019ve had it, given the combined symptoms and circumstances. Now I\u2019ve basically recovered, but - AND THIS IS THE BOTTOM LINE: I almost didn\u2019t feel ill. My last cold was much worse than this! Had it not been for someone else having the virus simultainously I might not even have suspected anything. Then I would just have thought I was feeling unusually tired with a bit of a cough. And this it what makes it so much more dangerous. Many (especially young people) might not notice any symptoms at all, or very mild symptoms. Then they don\u2019t know they have the virus and can pass it on to people in risk groups. We who don\u2019t belong to a risk group have an enormous responsibility, our actions can be the difference between life and death for many others. Please keep that in mind, follow the advice from experts and your local authorities and #StayAtHome to slow the spread of the virus. And remember to always take care of each other and help those in need. #COVID #flattenthecurve</a></p> \n     <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/gretathunberg/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Greta Thunberg</a> (@gretathunberg) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2020-03-24T15:22:26+00:00\">Mar 24, 2020 at 8:22am PDT</time></p>\n    </div>\n   </blockquote> \n   <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-24T16:06:19.799Z\">at 4.06pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7a282e8f08e4a2e5edc024\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-24T15:34:36.712Z\">3.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Russia</strong> is to close nightclubs and cinemas due to the coronavirus, reports the RIA Novosti news agency.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-24T16:02:58.004Z\">at 4.02pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7a27cc8f08c78e185cfed0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-24T15:32:15.399Z\">3.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Italy\u2019s</strong> economy minister, Roberto Gualtieri, has said the eurozone\u2019s bailout fund should be used to help economies hit by the coronavirus crisis, with no strings attached.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe must use all the resources available at the EU level, including the ESM [the European Stability Mechanism], without any conditionality,\u201d Gualtieri told parliament.</p> \n  <p>The minister added that the EU should consider issuing a common debt instrument, or safe asset, something so far resisted by some of its richer members.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-24T16:02:19.921Z\">at 4.02pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7a250e8f08d17da4d88b28\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-24T15:23:02.160Z\">3.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYGovCuomo/status/1242468192712351745\">Cuomo goes</a> on to take aim at Donald Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1241935285916782593?s=20\">tweet</a> that the \u201ccure must not be worse than the problem itself\u201d.</p> \n  <p>It\u2019s all very well, the New York governor says, \u201cBut if you ask the American people to choose between public health and the economy then it\u2019s no contest.</p> \n  <p>\u201cNo American is going to say, accelerate the economy at the cost of human life because no American is going to say how much a life is worth.

in adult prisons,\u201d Amnesty International Australia Indigenous Rights Lead, Lidia Thorpe said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cMost of these kids are later released without conviction, only underlining that it\u2019s totally unacceptable to leave them in prison when they would be safer at home with their family.</p> \n  <p>Thorpe said under the Convention of the Rights of the Child, detention of a child before trial or after sentencing must be used only as a measure of last resort, for the shortest time possible, and separate from detained adults wherever possible.</p> \n  <p>\u201cGiven that the spread of COVID-19 is a particular public health concern in custodial environments, the authorities should urgently release these children and seriously consider the same for other groups at special risks,\u201d Amnesty said.</p> \n  <p>Earlier today the NSW government announced new emergency powers aimed at keeping the justice system functional, including giving the corrections minister power to

Carnival Corp\u2019s Ruby Princess, became the country\u2019s largest source of coronavirus infections as one of its passengers also became the eighth fatality nationally. <br><br>In a chain of events described by New South Wales state Police Minister David Elliott as a \u201cmonumental stuff-up\u201d, about 2,700 passengers were allowed to leave the ship when it docked in Sydney on 19 March. <br><br>By Tuesday, around 130 of those passengers had tested positive and officials were frantically hunting down other travellers to test them and track their movements. <br><br>Australia stepped closer to a full lockdown on Tuesday, with authorities warning of harsher penalties for anybody violating self-isolation orders as they began to worry that hospitals were starting to feel the strain. <br><br>With 1,984 cases, Australia has registered significantly lower rates of coronavirus compared to elsewhere in the world, but the infection rate has quickened in recent days and NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said it was now at a \u201ccritical stage.\u201d <br><br>While schools officially remained open in most of the country, parents were strongly advised to keep their children home, as

Experts <a href=\"https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/03/hundreds-of-u-s-coronavirus-cases-may-have-slipped-through-screenings/\">at Harvard University</a> have projected an infection rate in the US of between 20 - 60%, meaning that while it is impossible to reliably estimate the American coronavirus death toll <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/16/upshot/coronavirus-best-worst-death-toll-scenario.html\">a reasonable scenario</a> could result in hundreds of thousands of lives lost.</p> \n  <p>On first look, given the potentially devastating death toll directly associated with coronavirus, it appears unlikely to be matched by an increased rate in suicide, making the presidents claim almost certainly inaccurate. </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><em>In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255.

The country\u2019s betting shops will also be closed.</p> <p>Ireland had staged one meeting each day behind closed doors since Friday after Horse Racing Ireland (HRI), which administers the sport both north and south of the border, decided last week to continue racing with strict measures in place to ensure physical distancing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/23/poetic-flare-shows-real-promise-as-irish-flat-season-gets-under-way\">Poetic Flare shows real promise as Irish Flat season gets under way</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Irish Flat season on turf got under way at Naas on Monday but the latest restriction, which is due to be in place until 19 April, will mean the cancellation of both the Irish Lincolnshire on the Flat this weekend and the Irish Grand National meeting at Fairyhouse over the Easter weekend on 12 and 13 April. Prospects for the five-day Punchestown Festival, the climax to the Irish jumping season which is due to open on 28 April, also seem increasingly bleak.</p> <p>Ireland had been the only major racing nation in Europe still staging meetings after the BHA decided to suspend the British programme until at least 1 May last Tuesday. France, which had raced behind closed doors from early March, suspended all meetings until mid-April a day earlier.</p> <p>South Africa, which had also been staging regular meetings behind closed doors in recent days, also announced on Tuesday that racing in the country will end from Friday for at least three weeks.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone has to do their job,\u201d Gordon Elliott, the trainer of dual Grand National winner Tiger Roll, said on Tuesday. \u201cIf we get back after a month, it won\u2019t be the end of the world. Everybody is going to have to tighten up and hopefully we\u2019ll get through it OK.\u201d</p> <p>HRI issued a brief statement on Tuesday, confirming that all racing in the country would cease \u201cas of midnight tonight as per the latest Government guidelines on Covid-19\u201d.</p> <p>It added: \u201cThe Board of Horse Racing Ireland will meet tomorrow morning and will issue a press release soon after.\u201d</p>"
