We are very concerned about rising cases in low- and middle-income countries,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>Meanwhile Europe\u2019s director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the agency responsible for advising governments, including the UK, on disease control, has said that Europe should brace for a second wave of infections \u2013 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/top-eu-doctor-europe-should-brace-itself-for-second-wave-of-coronavirus\">The question is when and how big.

That it\u2019s not the time now to completely relax,\u201d she said. </p> \n  <p>Here are the top developments from the last few hours: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/global-report-coronavirus-pandemic-not-over-warns-the-who\">World sees largest daily rise in cases</a>. </strong>The World Health Organization gave a stark warning on Wednesday that the coronavirus pandemic is far from over, after 106,000 new cases were recorded worldwide over the past 24 hours \u2013 the most in a single day so far. Speaking in Geneva, the WHO\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the virus was spreading in poorer countries, just as wealthier nations were emerging from lockdown.</li> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/top-eu-doctor-europe-should-brace-itself-for-second-wave-of-coronavirus\">Europe should brace itself for a second wave of coronavirus infections</a></strong>, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments on disease control. \u201cThe question is when and how big. That is the question in my view,\u201d said Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.</li> \n   <li><strong>Trump considers an in-person G7 meeting despite coronavirus pandemic. </strong>Donald Trump has said he may seek to revive a face-to-face meeting of Group of Seven leaders near Washington, after earlier canceling the gathering due to the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cI am considering rescheduling the G-7, on the same or similar date, in Washington, DC, at the legendary Camp David,\u201d the US president tweeted on Wednesday. \u201cThe other members are also beginning their COMEBACK. It would be a great sign to all \u2013 normalization!\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>International imports and exports have fallen to their lowest level for at least four years</strong>, according to World Trade Organization figures. Warning that there was little prospect of the downturn ending soon, the global authority on trade said it believed import and export activity would fall precipitously in the first half of 2020.</li> \n   <li><strong>Tourists will be welcomed back to Greece from 15 June</strong>, the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has announced. \u201cThe tourism period begins June 15, when seasonal hotels can reopen, and direct international flights to our tourist destinations will gradually begin 1 July,\u201d Mitsotakis said in a televised address.</li> \n   <li><strong>South Africa records its first neonatal coronavirus death. </strong>South Africa has recorded its first neonatal coronavirus death, the country\u2019s health ministry has said.The two-day old baby was born prematurely and had lung difficulties that required ventilation support immediately after birth, the health minister Zweli Mkhize said.</li> \n   <li><strong>France is to launch a complete shake-up of its health system</strong>, widely considered to be one of the best in the world, yet exposed by the pandemic. President Macron had already promised to overhaul the \u201csalaries, careers, speciality training and professional situation\u201d of staff, and to invest and reform financing of the health system.</li> \n   <li><strong>The arrival in Bangladesh of possibly the most powerful cyclone in more than a decade complicated coronavirus containment measures</strong>. Authorities were attempting to move 2.2 million people to safety as Cyclone Amphan made landfall on Wednesday morning, after days brewing in the Bay of Bengal.</li> \n   <li><strong>Amnesty International has urged governments to conduct urgent search operations to find as many as 1,000 Rohingya refugees</strong> who are stranded at sea and at risk of being hit by the cyclone. Rights groups said governments were using the pandemic as an excuse to turn away boats carrying stranded refugees, who may have been at sea for months.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Trump administration called on the UN to remove references to sexual health from its Covid-19 humanitarian response plan</strong>. In a letter to the UN secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the acting administrator for the US agency for international development, John Barsa, urged the UN to \u201cstay focused on life-saving interventions\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>The US president, Donald Trump, lashed out at Beijing, blaming it for \u201cmass worldwide killing\u201d</strong>.

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Latin America\u2019s infection rate overtakes US and Europe</h2> <p>Latin America has reported more new coronavirus cases than either the United States or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news\">Europe</a> for three days in a row, driven by high numbers in Brazil, Peru and Mexico, CNN analysis of Johns Hopkins University and World Health Organization data shows. The region reported at least 32,854 new cases on Wednesday, more than half of which were in Brazil.</p> <h2>Italy\u2019s death toll could be 60% higher than assumed</h2> <p>Italy\u2019s coronavirus death toll in March and April could be nearly 19,000 higher than the official figure of 32,000, the national social security agency said Thursday. As of Friday, the pandemic has claimed 32,486 deaths in Italy, of which 26,715 have been in Lombardy alone, Europe\u2019s worst affected region.</p> <h2>Brazil\u2019s PM to sign off federal aid programme</h2> <p>Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro said he will sign off a 60 billion-real ($10.72 bn) federal aid programme for states and cities hit by coronavirus, but asked governors for support by freezing public sector pay increases.</p> <h2>British government acted too slow, says scientific adviser</h2> <p>A scientific adviser to the British government has said that he would have liked ministers to have acted \u201ca week or two weeks earlier\u201d in the virus pandemic. Ian Boyd, who sits on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which advises ministers on Covid-19, said it would have made \u201cquite a big difference\u201d to the death rate.</p> <h2>Chechnya\u2019s leader <strong>Kadyrov</strong> possibly ill with Covid-19</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/head-of-chechen-republic-hospitalised-with-suspected-covid-19\">Ramzan Kadyrov</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/head-of-chechen-republic-hospitalised-with-suspected-covid-19\"> is in a Moscow hospital </a>suffering from suspected coronavirus, Russian news agencies reported, adding that the ally of Vladimir Putin was \u201cunder medical supervision\u201d and in a \u201cstable\u201d condition.</p> <h2>Russian economy battered by Covid-19</h2> <p>Russia\u2019s industrial output fell by 6.6% in April compared to the previous year, with its economy predicted to shrink by up to 6% in 2020. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">Russia</a> imposed a \u201cnon-working\u201d period across the country at the end of April, and Russia\u2019s Audit Chamber predicts that the number of unemployed will grow from 2.5 million to eight million this year.</p> <h2>Remote working is here to stay for Facebook workers</h2> <p>Half of Facebook\u2019s workforce could shift to permanent home working by the end of the decade, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/21/facebook-coronavirus-remote-working-policy-extended-years\">founder Mark Zuckerberg has revealed</a>, saying it was \u201cquite possible\u201d that over the next five to 10 years about 50% of staff at the company could be working from home.</p> <h2>California pastors to defy stay-at-home order</h2> <p>More than 1,200 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california\">California</a> pastors say they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/21/california-pastors-services-stay-home-order\">will resume in-person services this month </a>in defiance of governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s stay-at-home order to slow the spread of coronavirus. California has more than 85,700 coronavirus cases and more than 3,400 deaths.</p> <h2>Puerto Rico to reopen economy</h2> <p>Puerto Rico will cautiously reopen beaches, restaurants, churches, malls and hair salons next week under strict new rules as the US territory emerges from a two-month lockdown that stifled business activity on an island that now has a 40% unemployment rate.</p>",
  "<p>The US has declared its intention to leave the Open Skies Treaty, which is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/05/trump-administration-treaty-war-russia-withdraw\">intended to reduce the risk of war</a> by allowing Russia and western nations to conduct observation flights over each other\u2019s territory.</p> <p>Washington informed the other 33 parties to the treaty of its intention to deliver a formal six-month notice of withdrawal on Friday, accusing Russia of violations.</p> <p>\u201cI think we have a very good relationship with Russia, but Russia didn\u2019t adhere to the treaty, and so until they adhere to the treaty, we will pull out,\u201d Donald Trump told reporters. He added: \u201cThere\u2019s a very good chance we\u2019ll make a new agreement or do something to put that agreement back together.\u201d</p> <p>In a written statement, the secretary of state Mike Pompeo said the US could reconsider its withdrawal during the six month notice period \u201cshould Russia return to full compliance with the Treaty\u201d. Moscow denies being in violation of the agreement.</p> <p>By starting the six-month notice period now, the administration ensures that - even if Donald Trump loses the election in November \u2013 the US will have left the treaty before a Biden administration takes office.</p> <p>\u201cThe timing of the Trump administration\u2019s decision to withdraw is clearly tied to the political calendar,\u201d said Bob Menendez, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \u201cBy rushing this abrupt withdrawal, it is clear the Trump Administration is attempting to bind a future administration from participation in this longstanding and valuable treaty for our nation.\u201d</p> <p>America\u2019s European allies are keen to keep the treaty going. They have benefited from the more than 1,500 overflights carried out under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/05/trump-administration-treaty-war-russia-withdraw\">the OST</a>, allowing them to observe Russian military movements, and see it as a remaining element of international cohesion and transparency.</p> <p>\u201cThe writing has been on the wall for a long time,\u201d a European diplomat said, adding it was \u201cstill disappointing\u201d.</p> <p>The OST is the third arms control agreement Trump has left. He took the US out of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/08/iran-deal-trump-withdraw-us-latest-news-nuclear-agreement\">Iran nuclear deal in 2018</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/01/inf-donald-trump-confirms-us-withdrawal-nuclear-treaty\">Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces</a> treaty in 2019. There are fears for the future of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/01/us-senate-pushes-trump-to-safeguard-last-russian-nuclear-arms-control-treaty\">the last treaty limiting US and Russian strategic nuclear weapons</a>, New Start, which is due to expire in February next year, and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which the US has signed (observing a voluntary moratorium on nuclear tests) but not ratified.</p> <p>It is unclear how Russia will respond to US withdrawal. They will now be able to fly over US bases in Europe but the US will no longer be allowed to overfly Russia.</p> <p>Under the 2020 defence spending act, the administration is supposed to explain to Congress how leaving OST serves US security interests and give assurances that Washington has consulted its partners, 120 days before serving formal notice of withdrawal.</p> <p>\u201cReckless deal wrecking and the collapse of US leadership continues,\u201d Kingston Reif, director for disarmament and threat reduction policy at the Arms Control Association said.</p> <p>\u201cThe treaty benefits US and European security. Our allies value it and don\u2019t want us to leave. It has been an important tool for responding to Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine. This is a propaganda coup for Moscow.\u201d</p> <p>The US has complained about curbs that Moscow has imposed on overflights that have violated the accord. Russia limited the flight time of observation flights over the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad and set up an exclusion corridor along the border of the Russian-occupied regions of Georgia, South Ossetia and Abkhazia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/europe-must-prepare-for-us-exit-from-vital-russia-treaty-former-nato-generals-warn\">Europe must prepare for US exit from vital Russia treaty, former Nato generals warn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cRealize the Russians were cheating,\u201d Tim Morrison, who was briefly the top arms control official in the Trump White House, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tim_Morrison/status/1263512735385600004\">said on Twitter</a>. \u201cThey were misusing the treaty against the US \u2013 as senior military and civilian leaders warned.

  "<p>There\u2019s sometimes a fine line between a government reacting nimbly to events and one that appears to be totally at sea. But right now Boris Johnson is working flat out to make it abundantly clear that his government has chosen to firmly come down on the side of complete cluelessness.</p> <p>On Wednesday at prime minister\u2019s questions, Boris had been clear. It was entirely right for people from overseas working in the NHS and social care sectors to pay a \u00a3624 visa surcharge to use the NHS themselves. After all, if they were going to come over here and try to save people\u2019s lives \u2013 the prime minister\u2019s included \u2013 then they ought to pay for the privilege. It was just common sense. People working on the front line were far more likely to get coronavirus, so they could well end up using NHS resources that should have been available to hardworking Brits who wouldn\u2019t dream of doing such a highly skilled job for so little money. Call it the Corona Cough-Up.</p> <p>Midway through Thursday, though \u2013 after a lot of pushback from all opposition parties and several of his own MPs \u2013 Boris had a change of heart. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/johnson-forced-to-drop-nhs-surcharge-for-migrant-health-workers\">NHS staff and care workers would be exempt from the surcharge</a>. Though, needless to say, all other workers who helped keep the NHS up and running, such as delivery drivers and childminders, would still get fleeced. Because they were all still slackers and freeloaders.</p> <p>So you might have thought that Boris might want to use the daily Downing Street press conference as a platform to explain his unexpected fit of compassion and largesse. Or even to express his delight that the police had decided that doing financial favours for someone he had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/08/boris-johnson-failed-to-disclose-meetings-with-jennifer-arcuri-in-diary\">doing IT with</a> was no big deal.</p> <p>Only, Boris doesn\u2019t do press briefings any more. Or anything much. Can\u2019t be arsed. Why should the prime minister explain anything to anyone during the worst health crisis in 100 years? It was a nice afternoon, he was about to go on a 10-day Whitsun break with Carrie, Dilyn the dog and some baby that had mysteriously appeared in Downing Street, and he could do without the hassle. And it had been a whole two months since he\u2019d taken 10 days off right at the beginning of the pandemic. In any case, he\u2019d already had coronavirus, so he was just fine.</p> <p>Inevitably, then, it was Matt Hancock who got lumbered with the press conference. Matt gets landed with all the shit jobs right now and he\u2019s resigned to the fact that he\u2019s been set up as the fall guy. Old habits die hard with the health secretary. His natural demeanour as the enthusiastic class nerd, whose exercise books are full of high-school massacre fantasies, is hardwired into his personality. He longs to stand up to the prime minister, but instinctively crumbles. He justifies it as furthering his career, but there\u2019s a tragic sadness to his ambition these days. As if he knows he ran out of road several weeks back, but can\u2019t help himself.</p> <p>Matt opened by talking about mental health awareness week. \u201cIt is OK to not be OK,\u201d he said. These were the only true and heartfelt words he said throughout the hour. Because he was talking to himself as much as anyone following the briefing on TV. Matt is not OK. He hasn\u2019t been OK for a while. He\u2019s become snappier, more short-tempered. He\u2019s aged visibly over the past few months. Lines have appeared on his shiny, prepubescent face. In time, we might see hints of acne. If anyone in the cabinet really cared about his mental health, they\u2019d put Matt on a furlough scheme for several months.</p> <p>After monotoning his way through a spiel about various tests that he knows no one would take seriously, as the government has failed on just about every promise it has so far made during the crisis, Matt came to the bit he had been dreading: the questions. Inevitably, first up was Johnson\u2019s U-turn on the visa surcharge. Here was his chance to stick up for himself, to say he had never believed in it and it had only ever been some vindictive scheme dreamed up by Boris and Priti Patel to keep Brexiters happy. But Matt didn\u2019t have the self-worth to be anything other than a lapdog. Boris had misunderstood Keir Starmer at PMQs and had imagined he was talking about the surcharge in general and not just for NHS workers.</p> <p>Matt was now in so deep that the lies began to slip off the tongue with increasing ease. Yes, the government was all over social care, and no person would be asked to sell their home to pay for their care. Which will come as news to my mother, who had to sell hers to pay for her care. But the health secretary\u2019s worst moment came when he was asked about his \u201ctest, track and trace app\u201d that only a few weeks ago he was telling the country would be key to easing lockdown restrictions, but has now gone missing in action. It was due to be launched nationwide in mid-May, but now Matt can\u2019t even bring himself to mention it in polite conversation. Selective amnesia.</p> <p>What app? Oh, that app. Well, when he had said it was vital, what he had really meant was that it was utterly peripheral. In fact, in many ways it was far better that the test and track process begin without the app, as it was far better to have tracking from people who had scarcely been given any training in what they were doing. Everything was going to be fine \u2013 just not yet. After a question about restarting football from Robbie Savage \u2013 basically, just forget it \u2013 Matt slipped away. It had been an ordeal.

They had been previously given a one-year exemption.</p> \n<p>However, just 24 hours earlier, at prime minister\u2019s questions, Johnson had dug in over the charge in an exchange with Starmer. He justified the fee because of the financial contribution it made to the NHS, which he estimated at \u00a3900m.</p> \n<p>Figures from the House of Commons Library showed that \u00a3917m was raised over four years from all migrants paying the surcharge. The library estimated it would cost about \u00a335m a year to exempt all NHS staff, and more for care workers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The SNP, Lib Dems and other opposition parties also voiced their concerns about the charge, while emotional social media videos by Syrian hospital cleaner Hassan Akkad on the plight of the lowest-paid healthcare workers during the coronavirus pandemic have been shared thousands of times.</p> \n<p>Jeremy Hunt was among the leading voices calling for the U-turn, despite introducing the fee in 2015 during his time as health secretary. The now chair of the health select committee urged the government to change its mind just as No 10 announced it was dropping the surcharge.</p> \n<p>Speaking to Nick Robinson on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Political Thinking podcast, he said: \u201cGiven the sacrifices that we\u2019ve seen during the coronavirus pandemic, low-paid frontline health and care workers need to be thought about differently, and I think one of the ways that we could do this is by looking at that surcharge, so I very much hope the government will do something.\u201d</p> \n<p>Despite the mounting pressure, Tory MPs were still surprised by the speed at which Johnson changed tack. An increase to the surcharge was a manifesto promise in last year\u2019s general election campaign.</p> \n<p>The education select committee chair, Robert Halfon, who was one of the four Tory MP rebels who said the charge should be abandoned, added: \u201cI had no idea this was going to happen \u2013 not in a million years. I think it\u2019s impossible to say to NHS workers in very low-paid work, who are risking their lives to look after us, that we are going to whack a few hundred quid charge on them. </p> \n<p>\u201cIt was just unpalatable to the British people. I welcome that the prime minister has listened. This raises a much bigger issue, and if there\u2019s any silver lining to Covid-19, I hope this means a relentless focus on how we can help the low-paid.\u201d</p> \n<p>Conservative MP William Wragg, who was the first to say he would support Labour in its bid to scrap the surcharge, said Johnson had \u201cshown true leadership\u201d and had listened and reflected.</p> \n<p>Former Conservative cabinet minister David Mundell said the shift was the right thing for Johnson\u2019s government to do. \u201cIt was inconsistent with the deep gratitude everyone feels for NHS staff at this time,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Earlier in the day, former Conservative party vice-chair and MP for North Thanet, Sir Roger Gale, said it would \u201crightly be perceived as mean-spirited\u201d, while Andrew Boff, a senior Tory on the Greater London assembly, said: \u201cI\u2019m very proud of my party, but this is not its finest hour. These people have saved lives, then we give them a bill.\u201d</p> \n<p>The former Tory party chair Chris Patten said the fee would be \u201cimmoral and monstrous\u201d.</p> \n<p>Another senior Tory, Bob Neill, chair of the justice select committee, said the charge was \u201ca small sum in the overall scheme of things\u201d and the government should show generosity of spirit as a nation.</p> \n<p>Tory MPs in Scotland and London were said to be very uneasy with the fee as they are the regions that rely most heavily on migrant labour in the healthcare sector and where immigration policies can be hard to defend. The Royal College of Nursing had also wanted health workers to be exempt from the \u201cunfair\u201d charge.</p> \n<p>So far during the crisis, 181 health service and 131 care staff have died, according to government figures.</p> \n<p>The reversal is being viewed as a victory for Starmer. Following the announcement, he called the decision \u201cthe right thing to do. We cannot clap our carers one day and then charge them to use our NHS the next.\u201d </p>",
  "<h2>26 April</h2> \n<p>At the daily government coronavirus press conference, the home secretary, Priti Patel, said the surcharge was \u201cunder review\u201d when challenged on the issue, adding: \u201cWe are looking at everything, including visas and surcharge.\u201d</p> \n<h2>16 May</h2> \n<p>Three weeks after Patel said the policy was under review, it emerged that the Home Office did not specifically review the surcharge, only temporarily exempting NHS workers whose visas were due to expire before October by extending their visa for free for one year.</p> \n<h2>18 May</h2> \n<p>The shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, urged a government rethink, saying on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI think that it is totally unfair on the one hand to be saying thank-you to those foreign-born workers we have in our NHS, and then charging them for actually using it.\u201d</p> \n<h2>20 May</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1e3f26c7efd10518bf0ac4534ba54a44a068ac9\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1e3f26c7efd10518bf0ac4534ba54a44a068ac9/0_192_5185_3111/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Keir Starmer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, challenged Boris Johnson on the issue at PMQs on Wednesday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Taylor/AFP/Getty</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>At PMQs, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, challenged Johnson on the issue, saying: \u201cDoes the prime minister think it is right that care workers coming from abroad and working on our front line should have to pay a surcharge of hundreds, sometimes thousands of pounds to use the NHS themselves?\u201d</p> \n<p>The prime minister defended the decision as \u201cthe right way forward\u201d. But in the evening, rebellion started brewing among backbench Conservative MPs, with three influential Commons committee chairs backing Starmer\u2019s calls.</p> \n<p>William Wragg, chair of the public administration and constitutional affairs committee, tweeted: \u201cNow is the time for a generosity of spirit towards those who have done so much good. I am sure that Conservative colleagues will be supportive.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>21 May</strong></h2> \n<p>Hassan Akkad, a Syrian hospital cleaner whose viral video on the NHS bereavement scheme for migrant workers led to a government U-turn, said on Good Morning Britain: \u201cIt\u2019s unfair, it\u2019s unjust, and I would argue that it\u2019s inhumane. For most cleaners and porters this is two weeks\u2019 salary.\u201d</p> \n<p>Jeremy Hunt, who introduced the fee in 2015 during his time as health secretary, added his voice to calls for it to be scrapped, saying: \u201cLow-paid frontline health and care workers need to be thought about differently.\u201d</p> \n<p>A government spokesperson continued to defend the position, saying the NHS \u201cneeds funding\u201d. But later government sources were quoted as saying the prime minister had been \u201cthinking hard\u201d about the position before a statement was released saying: \u201cWork by officials is now under way on how to implement the change and full details will be announced in the coming days.\u201d</p> \n<p>At the daily government press conference, when asked why Johnson had changed his mind, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the prime minister was talking about the surcharge in general, whereas now he was talking about exemptions.</p> \n<p>Nearly a month after her cancelled review, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pritipatel/status/1263516558581694464\">Priti Patel tweeted</a>: \u201cGiven these extraordinary circumstances, Matt Hancock and I are working together to remove NHS and care workers from the NHS surcharge as soon as possible.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic junior doctors Ibreez Ajaz and Mohammad Ivan have been working in the intensive care unit, doing gruelling 13-hour shifts from 8am to 9pm.

When I first saw the news I thought it was a joke,\u201d said Ibreez. \u201cI am really glad \u2013 it\u2019s great for morale and for showing appreciation for our work.

The surcharge costs \u00a3300 a year for student visas and \u00a3400 a year for all other visa and immigration applications. It is set to rise in October. A migrant\u2019s dependants usually need to pay the same amounts.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Who does not need to pay?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>You don\u2019t pay this fee if you are applying for indefinite leave to enter or remain, or if you are a diplomat or member of a visiting armed forces. Other exemptions include a dependant of a member of the UK\u2019s armed forces and a family member of a European national, as well as asylum seekers and victims of slavery or human trafficking.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Paying these fees, as well as visa charges, had taken its toll on Ibreez and her husband. \u201cWhile we are not living paycheck to paycheck, we have been scrimping and saving, and we really need to consider our next 5-year visa and we thought if the surcharge goes up to \u00a3624 a year for both of us \u2013 and with visa costs on top of that \u2013 it is a lot of money,\u201d Ibreez, who came to the UK from Texas, US, said.</p> \n<p>She said that the surcharge and extra costs have meant that the couple were unable to buy a car, adding that for some migrants arriving in the UK the high costs mean they cannot bring their children over.</p> \n<p>\u201cA car does give you a sense of freedom \u2013 you don\u2019t have to wait for a bus or have to think about taking a cab or anything like that. Our main concern in our first year was about having enough to pay for a three-year visa,\u201d she added, saying that the couple had to take on extra hours to ensure they had enough money for that.</p> \n<p>\u201c[All our savings] are not for rainy day funds but for visas, we have to put a chunk of money aside for that purpose and it is a matter of priority,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are lucky we do not necessarily need to use the health services but even if we were we were already paying in for it with taxes and national insurance and we are also part of the workforce,\u201d said Ibreez.</p> \n<p>On top of surcharge fees, a migrant worker on a 10-year pathway to citizenship will pay visa fees every two and a half years to allow them to keep working. These are currently \u00a31,033. After three sets of fees, the worker pays for indefinite leave to remain at the end of 10 years, for a further \u00a32,389. The costs are far higher than in other European countries.</p> \n<p>Ibreez\u2019s husband, Mohammad, also regularly sends money back to his mother in Bangladesh, where he hails from. \u201cYes we are both working and that helps us financially together but yes \u2013 if we talk about the money we could save from not paying this it would help.\u201d</p> \n<p>For couples, such as Ibreez and Mohammad, the charges being lifted means they feel a new sense of support. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic when people clap on Thursday for the NHS and we are getting lots of support within the community but this is a great way for the government to show that the gratitude is meant.\u201d</p> \n<p>She says that her and her husband both came to the UK for a purpose and with the aspiration of supporting a free health system that they admire.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was about the concept of this universal healthcare,\u201d Ibreez said.</p> \n<p>Mohammad added: \u201cThe NHS has been proving how healthcare should be worldwide and I really like the idea that we can provide to patients without thinking what their circumstances are. That is a wonderful thing.\u201d</p> \n<p>Doctors also welcomed the government\u2019s decision. Dr Rebecca Lewis, of the Doctors\u2018 Association UK said the organisation was delighted with the U-turn.</p> \n<p>\u2018\u2018At all times, but especially in the current pandemic, it is absolutely right that health workers who should be exempt from an extra charge to access the health service they contribute so much,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are privileged to have them care for us, and finally this has been recognised. This a welcome decision from Boris Johnson and one we applaud.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<p>\u201cYour football has to be mirrored by your soul,\u201d J\u00fcrgen Klopp says as he explains why his appearance on the touchline has no effect on his team\u2019s performance. Liverpool\u2019s manager is midway through a fascinating answer about his dress code and has an important message for the aspiring coaches listening to him on Zoom. \u201cYou have to bring your own character in.\u201d</p> <p>This is an unusual setting for Klopp. It is Liverpool\u2019s first day back in phase one training but the manager of the Premier League\u2019s dominant force has given up part of his afternoon to take part in a mentoring session for Kick It Out, football\u2019s anti-discrimination charity.

Lami, buzzing as he holds up a copy of Klopp\u2019s autobiography, takes a risk with a question about the German\u2019s fashion sense. \u201cComing as a refugee to England, appearance is something I\u2019ve always been kind of cautious about,\u201d the 29-year-old says. \u201cI\u2019ve been critical of myself and made sure I\u2019m well dressed. But when I look at you, I don\u2019t see a traditional coach in terms of a suit. How did you go against that traditional look?\u201d</p> <p>The manager of the European champions listens intently before letting out a booming laugh. \u201cInteresting,\u201d Klopp says. \u201cWhat I can read between the lines is that I look like a tramp on the sidelines?\u201d</p> <p>Klopp has taken a shine to Lami, who tells the former Borussia Dortmund manager about moving to England from Albania when he was a boy, his challenging upbringing in east London and falling into a downward spiral after struggling to make it as a footballer. Lami fell in with the wrong crowd and it was only after he was stabbed that he went down a path that has led to coaching in the Middle East. Klopp is impressed and he does not mind being asked about his lack of sartorial elegance.</p> <p>\u201cI was a player and the next day I was the manager,\u201d Klopp says, remembering how he got his break at Mainz at the age of 35. \u201cIn my locker room was the tracksuit of the guy who had the job two days before. It didn\u2019t even fit me. I was just focused on the game. I never thought about how I look. I know it\u2019s not too cool because we are working in public but then when I came to Borussia Dortmund I thought: \u2018Maybe I have to change.\u2019 I went for a while wearing jeans and a shirt. But I just didn\u2019t feel comfortable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48eaae167963203ec6003bfa9a29f715962a6451\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48eaae167963203ec6003bfa9a29f715962a6451/0_132_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"J\u00fcrgen Klopp opted for a suit for the Champions League final as Borussia Dortmund manager in 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">J\u00fcrgen Klopp opted for a suit for the Champions League final as Borussia Dortmund manager in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s bad for you.

You think you have to convince people with the way you look.\u201d</p> <p>As Klopp enters full motivational mode it becomes obvious to see how he connects with his players. He wants Lami to trust himself but also points out the ultimate test will be how his team look on the pitch.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/audio/2020/may/21/illicit-haircuts-celtics-title-and-lifting-morale-football-weekly-extra-podcast\">Illicit haircuts, Celtic's title and lifting morale \u2013 Football Weekly Extra</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cBe yourself as a coach,\u201d Klopp says. \u201cIf you want to look great, then wonderful.

I like when you see the soul or character of the coach in the team. Guardiola again: you see a team and think: \u2018Wow, that\u2019s either Guardiola or somebody who worked with him.\u2019 But you can never be exactly the same. Dressing is one part of our character. Wear what you want, but don\u2019t make it the most important thing. In the end the game is what counts. But don\u2019t worry: you can be world champion in a suit or a tracksuit. You just have to be comfortable.\u201d</p> <p>Lami wants to know the secret of Klopp\u2019s self-belief. \u201cI was full of confidence as a kid,\u201d he says. \u201cWhatever I did my mother said: \u2018Brilliant.\u2019 My father said: \u2018Sensational.\u2019 I got filled with love. I don\u2019t doubt people. I am completely open. I have nothing to hide. I give everything but I don\u2019t expect I get something for it.\u201d</p> <p>Klopp\u2019s acceptance that defeat is part of life has been a key part of his success at Liverpool, who are within touching distance of winning their first title in 30 years. \u201cI give everything. I expect my players to give everything. Then we see what we get. That creates the mentality of the team.\u201d</p> <p>Rahman, part of the former Birmingham and Derby defender Michael Johnson\u2019s staff when Guyana reached the Gold Cup for the first time last year, asks about communication. For Klopp, the key is thinking about the message. \u201cI know myself well,\u201d he says. \u201cI trust myself to say the right thing in the right moment.\u201d</p> <p>The mind goes back to Liverpool\u2019s finest escape acts under Klopp: the Europa League <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/14/liverpool-borussia-dortmund-europa-league-report\" title=\"\">quarter-final win over Dortmund</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/07/liverpool-barcelona-champions-league-semi-final-second-leg-match-report\" title=\"\">fighting back from a 3-0 defeat</a> in the first leg to reach the Champions League final at Barcelona\u2019s expense last season. \u201cAgainst Dortmund we were 3-1 down at half-time.

I said: \u2018Boys, this is the day we create a story we can tell our grandchildren.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cBefore Barcelona, it was not planned. I said: \u2018It is really unlikely you go through, but because it\u2019s you we have a chance.\u2019 It\u2019s 100% what I thought. You cannot create a proper message by searching for it.

It\u2019s a nice game, a simple game. But it\u2019s not easy. That\u2019s why so many people think they understand it but stop so early. There are lot of things to learn. A lot of things to watch. You have to learn constantly.</p> <p>\u201cThe moment you stop learning, the game develops. I started 20 years ago. Is it the same game? No. It\u2019s so much more physical, so much quicker. The other thing is be yourself. You have no other chance. The moment you try to act like somebody else, you constantly think: \u2018What would he do?\u2019 Be yourself and learn more about the game.

The ending of the virtual Commons is in reality intended to bring an increasingly awkward parliament back to heel. But it could easily have the opposite effect.</p> <p>Mr Rees-Mogg has done all this because Boris Johnson\u2019s government is much more rattled by the politics of Covid-19 than it lets on. The prime minister\u2019s handling of coronavirus issues on television and in parliament has been shabby.

When his party, and even the country, has needed him to rise to the occasion, he has been out of sight and let unimpressive lieutenants face the music. Unsurprisingly, his ratings have fallen.

The former business secretary <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5801/cmselect/cmsctech/correspondence/200518-Chair-to-Prime-Minister-re-COVID-19-pandemic-some-lessons-learned-so-far.pdf\" title=\"\">Greg Clark</a> also wrote to Mr Johnson on behalf of the science select committee this week, saying that testing capacity had been \u201cinadequate for most of the pandemic so far\u201d \u2013 a devastating judgment just as ministers battle to get a system in place in England by 1 June.</p> <p>Meanwhile, there have also been significant revolts on the Conservative backbenches. In the first, on agricultural standards in any post-Brexit trade treaty with the US, 23 Tory MPs <a href=\"https://votes.parliament.uk/Votes/Commons/Division/784\" title=\"\">voted against</a> the government. This week, No 10\u2019s efforts to put its own man in charge of the Commons liaison committee that supposedly holds Mr Johnson to account provoked 16 <a href=\"https://votes.parliament.uk/Votes/Commons/Division/792\" title=\"\">Tory rebels</a>. A day after Westminster closed for Whitsun, No 10 was forced into the humbling U-turn on the migrant workers health surcharge after another much larger and more damaging <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/21/tory-mp-backs-labour-call-scrap-nhs-fees-migrant-health-staff\" title=\"\">Tory revolt</a> forced Mr Johnson to backtrack. The prime minister\u2019s ascendancy looks more fragile now.</p> <p>In the context of a pandemic in which more than 250,000 inhabitants of this country have tested positive for Covid-19 and in which more than 36,000 <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/uk-coronavirus-deaths-covid19-36000-a4447451.html\" title=\"\">have now died</a>, the government\u2019s parliamentary travails must be kept in proper perspective. Nevertheless, its political problems at Westminster are a striking metaphor for its wider mishandling of the coronavirus crisis. When the pandemic struck in March, virtual proceedings should have been introduced immediately, but were not. When the emergency system kicked in, it worked better than expected. But as it took root, the government came under challenge. Things started to go wrong in many areas. Other governments seemed to handle the pandemic better. Like Mr Johnson when he loosened the lockdown, Mr Rees-Mogg has now lurched prematurely back to the old normal, but without proper preparations in place. This is a government in disarray.</p> <p>The Tory high command clearly hopes that a recess and a full return to Westminster will enable it to run a much tighter ship. In fact, Mr Johnson and Mr Rees-Mogg are still busking it, as the latest U-turn shows. They are hoping that something will turn up. They would like to shift the argument back from health to Brexit. But the pandemic is not going away. Instead, it is exposing the government\u2019s failures and inadequacies more brutally with every day that passes.</p>",
  "<h2>NOTE TO SELF: MUST GET BLACKOUT BLIND</h2> \n<p>Frivolous sadness-related similes and metaphors are tough in a time of intense global misery. In many ways, The Fiver would suggest it\u2019s best to avoid them together. It\u2019s probably enough just to say something is sad rather than trying to find something of comparable sadness, especially if the level of sadness you are feeling really isn\u2019t very far up the sadness scale. For example, The Fiver ran out of ketchup while preparing a hot dog the other day, and had no choice but to continue with nothing but mustard. It was, as our empathetic reader will no doubt appreciate, an unhappy situation. I suppose you could say that we were approximately as sad as a dog that can\u2019t find its squeaky ball in the brief period before it is distracted by a squirrel, but unhappy would almost certainly do.</p> \n<p>Conjuring a perfect metaphor/simile is harder than a granite tank, particularly on the hoof. It\u2019s no coincidence that a list of the top 10 worst lyrics in the entire history of popular music compiled in 2007 featured \u201cmore sacrifices than an Aztec priest\u201d, \u201cyou\u2019re about as easy as a nuclear war\u201d and \u201cslowly walking down the hall, faster than a cannonball\u201d. Similes might sound very clever in the author\u2019s head, but in fact many people find them less impressive than a really tired, wilted old flower from, like, a garage or something. And so to Luis Enrique, coach of Spain\u2019s national team, who recently went on a show about basketball to talk about football. The decision-making here already seems questionable.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/20/atalanta-gian-piero-gasperini-serie-a\">Atalanta's Gian Piero Gasperini: 'Players who aren't used to working hard scare me'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It quickly became clear that the 50-year-old treats viruses with much the same disdain as he does <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/27/luis-enrique-sacked-robert-moreno-spain-disloyal-no2-euro-2020\">a sometime assistant\u2019s coaching career</a>. \u201cI would have had no fear,\u201d he said, asked whether a slightly younger him would have been willing to throw himself back into pitch-based rough-and-tumble despite prevailing viral concerns. \u201cOn a personal level, I\u2019m not worried about the virus but aware that there could be an impact on older people and those susceptible to greater suffering.\u201d And what, he was asked, about the spectacle of elite football being played behind closed doors? \u201cIt\u2019s sadder than \u2026\u201d he began. Now, where is this sentence going? Because really it\u2019s not very sad at all, is it? It\u2019s far from ideal, to be sure, but we can probably stop there. But the sentence has been started and there\u2019s no backing down now. It\u2019s got to finish somehow. \u201cIt\u2019s sadder than dancing with your own sister,\u201d he sighed.</p> \n<p>And, well, this is true. It is sadder than dancing and families, and sadder than rainbows and butterflies and fluffy bunny rabbits and lambs frolicking in long green grass and ice cream and laughter. It is sadder, in short, than things that are not sad. Sure, one might prefer to have someone else to dance with, but your own sister will certainly do. Luis Enrique had successfully avoided idiocy, at the expense of producing a simile that was about as revealing as a blackout blind inside a sealed box, wrapped in thickly lined curtain. \u201cWe have to remember, I guess, that this is big business and I understand that with football back, it may serve as a way of helping people in dealing with confinement,\u201d he concluded. \u201cWatching football in these circumstances is certainly odd.\u201d Fair point. Add it to the list of certainly odd things we\u2019re doing at the moment. It\u2019s a long one, and growing by the hour.</p> \n<h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> \n<p>\u201cYou must grow and improve, day by day, because if you do not improve, you are done.

There were 297 boat crossings by migrants in 2018, 1,890 last year and at least 1,040 so far this year.</p> <p>Under current legislation known as the Dublin convention one EU country can send an asylum seeker back to another if there is evidence that they were fingerprinted, claimed asylum or spent time in the first EU country before arriving in the second.</p> <p>However, human rights lawyers and campaigners say that they have gathered evidence that under Operation Sillath migrants are already being returned swiftly to France before their asylum claims have been properly considered, and even if there is no evidence of these things happening in France, in breach of the convention.</p> <p> Lily Parrott, a lawyer at Duncan Lewis solicitors, who is working on a legal challenge about Operation Sillath and the return of asylum seekers to France who arrive in small boats, said: \u201cWe are increasingly concerned about a trend that we have seen where the Home Office seeks to remove people from the UK to France after they arrived to the UK by boat. We feel that this is being done illegally and on the basis of a conflation between the Dublin convention and a UK-France treaty about border management.</p> <p>\u201cThis would be an egregious breach of European law that allowed many asylum-seekers to be wrongly removed from the UK.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this month the home secretary, Priti Patel, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/05/06/priti-patel-seeks-french-backing-plan-return-channel-migrants/\">urged her French counterparts</a> to back a new crackdown to enable the UK to return Channel migrants to France even if they have been found in British waters.</p> <p>A Home Office freedom of information response in March 2020 seen by the Guardian stated that last year (2019) 21 people were removed to France under the disputed clause of the Dublin convention.</p> <p>A further freedom of information response from the Home Office refers to Operation Sillath but declines to provide information about the operation on the basis that it would be too costly.</p> <p>An immigration detention centre visitor group has also raised concerns about the practice of returning people to France. The organisation sends visitors to people in the detention centres where some of the migrants have been detained.</p> <p>They expressed concern about \u201can alarming trend\u201d to attempt to remove asylum seekers from the UK to France even though their fingerprints had not been found in the European-wide database known as Eurodac and there was no clear evidence they spent any significant amount of time in France or claimed asylum there. They said that out of nine such cases they worked with recently at least two were possible victims of trafficking and three were possible victims of torture. One was removed to France by the Home Office where he was subjected to torture and abuse by migrant smugglers.</p> <p>Clare Moseley, founder of the charity <a href=\"https://care4calais.org/\">Care4Calais,</a> said that people crossing on boats had fled some of the most dangerous countries in the world.</p> <p>\u201cWhen they turn to us for help we simply must treat them fairly and properly. I know a man who was sent back to France in error and then was finally and correctly given UK asylum thanks to the excellent work of his lawyers. Being aware of his suffering I find it deeply shocking to think a different outcome was possible and may well have happened to others in the same position.\u201d</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cNo one should be making these dangerous and illegally-facilitated crossings from France to the UK. France is a safe country and no one should be getting on these boats and putting themselves in danger. We are working closely with the French government to tackle this dangerous and illegal activity, including returning over 155 migrants back to European countries.\u201d</p> <p>The French embassy has been approached for comment.</p>",
  "<p>Air travellers will have to wear face masks throughout all stages of their journey, they could be assessed in interview booths if they show signs of Covid-19, and will need to say goodbye to loved ones outside the airport, according to guidelines issued by the EU\u2019s air safety body.</p> <p>Instructions issued to airports and airlines also include: restrictions on hand luggage, reserving an on-board toilet for cabin crew and no onboard duty free or food trolleys.</p> <p>The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) <a href=\"https://www.easa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/dfu/EASA-ECDC_COVID-19_Operational%20guidelines%20for%20management%20of%20passengers_final.pdf\">published 28-pages of guidelines</a> that will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/16/small-planes-and-no-business-class-will-flying-ever-be-the-same-again-covid-19\">radically alter the experience of flying</a>, including physical distancing measures that Heathrow\u2019s chief executive has previously said would be impossible to implement. The UK has had no role in shaping EASA policy since the official Brexit date of 31 January but remains a member until the end of the year.</p> <p>Airlines and airports are likely to adopt many of the guidelines, which cover every stage of the air travel process.</p> <h2><strong>Arrival and check-in</strong></h2> <p>Anyone who develops symptoms after booking, or has been in contact with someone suffering from Covid-19, should not turn up to the flight.</p> <p>Passengers should not expect a lingering goodbye with loved ones at the terminal. With few exceptions, nobody who is not travelling or working there will be allowed inside.</p> <p>Those travelling are expected to take precautions such as washing hands and wearing masks, with exceptions for children under six and people with a medical reason not to. Regular reminders will be broadcast through the public address system, alongside the usual security messages and flight information.</p> <p>EASA also recommends \u201crespiratory etiquette\u201d, such as covering the face when sneezing. Those who do not comply could be ejected from the airport and suffer further penalties from local authorities.</p> <p>Physical distancing is defined as 1.5m, rather than the 2 metre gap Britons have been told to maintain. As in many shops and offices, there will be floor markings to show people where to stand in queues.</p> <p>However, physical distancing is unlikely to be feasible in many airports and the EASA guidelines state that if the 1.5m rule is not possible, the airport should implement additional measures such as hand hygiene. John Holland-Kaye, Heathrow chief executive, said physical distancing at a boarding gate would mean a queue of 1km for a jumbo jet. </p> <p>EASA said airport operators should set up interview booths for people found to have a temperature of more than 38C to assess possible illness.</p> <p>However, it also admits that temperature screening is not considered particularly effective at spotting Covid-19 and is more intended to \u201cdissuade ill persons from travelling by air and enhance public confidence\u201d. Nonetheless, Heathrow airport last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/06/heathrow-to-carry-out-temperature-checks-on-passengers\">rolled out temperature screening</a>, using camera detection systems to monitor multiple people at a time for signs of fever.</p> <p>Airport staff will need to wear face masks and hand them out to passengers not sporting their own. Protective perspex barriers are also likely to become a feature of check-in desks and security areas, under the guidelines. Heathrow has said it is installing 600 hand sanitiser stations, putting up signage featuring government health advice and even looking at using UV light to sanitise surfaces.</p> <h2><strong>Security</strong></h2> <p>As with the terminal, physical distancing will not always be possible in the security area. All staff will be wearing masks but security employees performing body checks may also be wearing face shields. Security screening trays will be much more frequently disinfected. Heathrow is also testing contact free security screening equipment.</p> <h2><strong>Boarding and disembarking</strong></h2> <p>Hand luggage restrictions could be even stricter. EASA recommends cutting down on cabin bags to speed up boarding and reduce contamination risk. It recommends airlines incentivise customers to do this, so there may be discounts on hold luggage charges.</p> <p>Passengers should be spaced apart if possible while boarding and disembarking and where buses are used, more should be provided. There may be an automated disinfectant dispenser at the aircraft door and a mat soaked with disinfectant to walk on.</p> <h2><strong>On board</strong></h2> <p>The aircraft should be thoroughly disinfected between flights, so trays are likely to be less grubby at least. EASA has asked airlines to install better air filters to clean the air in the cabin but everyone, passengers and crew, will be expected to wear masks. EASA recommends discarding them after four hours, meaning several may be needed for long-haul flights.</p> <p>Airlines have toyed with the idea of blocking off the middle seat to keep passengers further apart but whether this is mandatory will depend on where you are flying. Europe and the US do not require it, but Malaysia and Indonesia do.</p> <p>Using the toilet will be more difficult, with airlines advised to reserve one for cabin crew and prevent passengers queuing in the aisles where possible.</p> <p>The short-haul airline easyJet says there will be no food service on board its planes, at least initially. EASA has recommended \u201creduced\u201d food and drink services and no duty free sales onboard.</p> <p>EASA recommends strict protocols if someone falls ill on board with Covid-19 symptoms. Two rows of seats in every direction should be cleared and anyone who was sitting in them could be interviewed by public health authorities when they land. Their travelling companions will also be isolated.</p> <p>The ill passenger should be given their own toilet and be seated at the back right, near the outflow valve through which dirty air is dumped. The air nozzle above their seat should be turned off to reduce droplet spread and only crew members who have already interacted with them should continue to do so. </p> <h2><strong>Arrival and baggage claim</strong></h2> <p>Thermal screening may be applied at the arrival airport and airlines should provide public health authorities with a \u201cpassenger locator card\u201d if requested for contact tracing purposes. This will give a passenger\u2019s name, allocated seat and phone number or email.</p> <p>Governments have been asked to simplify border control processes, such as by using facial recognition. Immigration halls may have to be redesigned to ease passenger flow and border control agents will be trained to spot signs of illness.</p> <p>After collecting baggage, passengers will be told to leave the airport as soon as possible. Meet and greet will not be allowed for the most part. Where it cannot be avoided, a special area will be set up away from other arrivals.</p>",

Elsewhere, a homeless man is slowly sinking into the pavement outside a corporate office block. A disturbed janitor with a headful of rightwing propaganda brings a shotgun to his school. Volunteers dispense care and supplies at a foodbank in a coastal town. A Bolivian cleaner shouts to the oblivious office workers around her: \u201cAm I invisible?\u201d</p> <p>These are probably not the images of modern Britain that Theresa May had in mind when she announced a celebratory <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/12/festival-of-brexit-boss-120m-event-will-prove-cynics-wrong-martin-green\">Festival of Brexit</a> back in late 2018, but as a state-of-the-nation snapshot, they speak volumes. They are all from <a href=\"https://theuncertainkingdom.co.uk/\">The Uncertain Kingdom</a>, an anthology of 20 short films made last year. The films vary widely in subject and tone, from surreal comedy to hand-sketched animation. But recurring themes emerge: xenophobia, loneliness, identity, class and poverty. The overall mood could not be described as festive \u2013 apprehensive, more like. Is this really who we are? Or should that be, who we <em>were</em>? Thanks to Covid-19, The Uncertain Kingdom already has a time-capsule quality to it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"54ba6e230abe37db6bc1b9bf4267c8d255cb551a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54ba6e230abe37db6bc1b9bf4267c8d255cb551a/0_120_1997_1997/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Jencks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Jencks: \u2018We need to do quite a lot of shouting. And a lot of sighing.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David M Benett/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The so-called Festival of Brexit (now scheduled for 2022), was the direct inspiration for The Uncertain Kingdom, explains its instigator, <a href=\"https://www.electricshadowcompany.com/people\">John Jencks</a>: \u201cI was in the bath listening to Radio 4. It was November 2018, and there was an announcement about a post-Brexit festival that would bring us all together again and make us feel so proud of being British. And I groaned .\u201d Like many Britons, Jencks, a producer and director best known for his film adaptation of Stephen Fry\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jun/01/the-hippopotamus-review-stephen-fry-novel-roger-allam\">The Hippopotamus</a>, was not convinced the time was yet ripe for \u201cbringing us all together\u201d. \u201cActually we needed to do quite a lot of shouting. And a lot of sighing,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I thought the idea of a cultural response to this very febrile moment was utterly important.\u201d</p> <p>Jencks called on two producer colleagues, <a href=\"https://theuncertainkingdom.co.uk/the-team\">Georgia Goggin and Isabel Freer</a>, and they set up a fund to commission 20 shorts, with a budget of \u00a310,000 each. Some film-makers were invited directly, and there was an open call for proposals that received more than 1,100 applications. There were no rules, but each film had to \u201cmake an argument about Britain\u201d. The aim was less to present a coherent work than a diversity of perspectives. \u201cWe started to compare ourself with exhibitions, such as<a href=\"https://www.museumbookstore.com/blogs/blog/sensation-one-of-the-most-controversial-art-shows-of-all-time\"> Sensation</a>,\u201d says Jencks, citing the controversial 1997 British art show.</p> <p>The objective was not to provoke controversy per se, but seeing the results, and the conspicuous absence of flag-waving national pride, it is no great stretch to anticipate criticisms of \u201cdoing down Britain\u201d or pursuing a \u201clefty agenda\u201d. Britain\u2019s creative communities are generally progressive, and despite the producers\u2019 efforts to bring more right-leaning film-makers on board, political \u201cbalance\u201d was always going to be a challenge. \u201cThere are celebratory, joyous moments in a lot of the films. They\u2019re not uniformly negative,\u201d says Jencks. \u201cThey don\u2019t use the idea of Britishness as a punching bag. They are critical of Britain and our times and where we find ourselves, maybe because the idea of Britishness is so oblique.\u201d</p> <p>The Uncertain Kingdom might not use \u201cBritishness\u201d as a punch bag but it does literally use Cameron\u2019s head as one. The punching occurs in Strong Is Better Than Angry, directed by <a href=\"http://hopedicksonleach.com/\">Hope Dickson Leach</a> (best known for 2016 rural drama<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/may/14/the-levelling-review-mark-kermode-somerset-hope-dickson-leach\"> The Levelling</a>). It was a filmed at a women\u2019s kickboxing class in Edinburgh, where a diverse group talk about their anger, its causes \u2013 and who they\u2019d most like to punch. As well as Cameron, the list includes Donald Trump, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Nigel Farage, Boris Johnson, Brett Kavanaugh and Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/carrie-lam-blames-hong-kong-education-system-for-fuelling-protests\">Carrie Lam</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2d2c4523a277b2005dc52bd840970aca9aaf9600\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d2c4523a277b2005dc52bd840970aca9aaf9600/0_101_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hope Dickson Leach with the Cameron head on set of Strong Is Better Than Angry\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Political punch bag: Hope Dickson Leach with the Cameron head on set of Strong Is Better Than Angry</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The director says she was kickboxing to deal with her own anger at the time. \u201cProfessional stuff, but also it was #MeToo, and watching the government flailing around with Brexit.\u201d Dickson Leach maintains that rather than condoning violence against public figures, her film is about \u201cpunching up\u201d. \u201cI sort of wanted it to be shocking that women had these violent fantasises that drove us,\u201d she says. \u201cAround #MeToo, there was a lot of conversation between women about how anger was disallowed. Cinema is a space for violence and fantasy, so I didn\u2019t want to hold back. In the end I thought: \u2018I\u2019m not going to be scared by this, and if there\u2019s public anger, then so be it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Other films in The Uncertain Kingdom are less violent but no less direct in their criticism. Headline issues take on a personal dimension in short documentaries such as <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0759049/\">Carol Salter</a>\u2019s Left Coast, on a Blackpool food bank, or <a href=\"https://www.ellen-evans.com/\">Ellen Evans</a>\u2019s Motherland, on victims of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/19/lambs-to-the-slaughter-50-lives-ruined-by-the-windrush-scandal\">Windrush scandal</a>, black Britons recently deported to Jamaica. \u201cThey didn\u2019t really consider themselves anything but British,\u201d says Evans, who in a previous life was an immigration caseworker for an MP. \u201cTo be sent back to a place that the British state is deeming to be their home, but personally doesn\u2019t feel like it, is such a shocking thing.\u201d The uncertainty of the deportees\u2019 status could be seen as a mirror to Britain\u2019s uncertainty about its own identity. \u201cI was really interested in asking a question about what it means to be British, and more fundamentally, who gets to decide?\u201d</p> <p>The Uncertain Kingdom has its lighter moments. In Verisimilitude, an actor in a wheelchair rankles at being a \u201cdisability consultant\u201d to a narcissistic, able-bodied star. In Swan, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004692/\">Mark Addy </a>plays a man preparing for a new, elite tier of British citizenship which involves being transformed into a swan. And in The Conversation, communication difficulties between a young black man and his white partner are expressed in the form of an intense, physical dance routine. \u201cThere are visceral feelings we all share but can\u2019t put into words,\u201d says film-maker <a href=\"https://www.lanremalaolu.com/\">Lanre Malaolu</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bd1dad1f9d00c085593f2fe01096f9e571577b85\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd1dad1f9d00c085593f2fe01096f9e571577b85/53_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lanre Malaolu\u2019s short The Conversation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Communication difficulties in Lanre Malaolu\u2019s short The Conversation, starring Onyemachi Ejimofor</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Recent events have given some of the films an unintended resonance. In Death Meets Lisolette, a young girl in a seaside town finds Death (played by Outnumbered\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/16/hugh-dennis-my-family-values\">Hugh Dennis</a>) locked in a barn. Her grandmother has early-onset dementia and is looking for a way to end her life, so the girl makes a deal. What was intended as a gentle comedy, now feeds into a national reassessment of attitudes to mortality and the elderly. The film\u2019s images of a Grim Reaper stalking the beaches, scythe in hand, chime uncannily with recent news footage of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/07/florida-grim-reaper-beach-interview\">a campaigner who did exactly the same thing in protest at the premature reopening of beaches in Florida</a>.</p> <p>With Britain effectively on pause, these films give us a snapshot of the country as it was, and ask whether it\u2019s one we really want to return to. \u201cWhen I think about the individual ideas in the films, none of them have gone away,\u201d says Jencks. \u201cThey\u2019re all going to be waiting for us once we get out of the world we currently we find ourselves in \u2013 or they have been exacerbated by it, like isolation and loneliness, for example.\u201d</p> <p>The Uncertain Kingdom initiative has recently commissioned a 21st film, says Jencks, to be made under lockdown conditions. The original intention was to hold community screenings showing four or five of the most relevant films, followed by audience discussion. Jencks hopes that can still happen. \u201cA little bit of bloodletting and shouting might let us get to a point where we <em>could</em> have a post-Brexit festival of Britain. I\u2019m not against that, except if it is being used to paper over cracks or stuff a sock down someone\u2019s throat. There are loads of brilliant things about this country and they should be celebrated, but we\u2019re not there yet.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://theuncertainkingdom.co.uk/\">The Uncertain Kingdom is out 1 June</a> on BFI Player, Curzon Home Cinema, iTunes, GooglePlay and more</p></li> </ul>",

Four days after the England entourage walked into the gift shop near to the team hotel foyer where they were based for their warm-up matches, Moore was under arrest. It was a worldwide sensation and for an impressionable nine-year-old, on my teacher\u2019s prompting, the seemingly upstanding England captain became the focus of my attention.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"07af2e870c4ada94f89765c3c9f3b86a5348a1d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07af2e870c4ada94f89765c3c9f3b86a5348a1d8/0_365_2656_1595/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Plain clothed and uniformed policemen surround England Football captain Bobby Moore, in white shirt, as he leaves the Fuego Verde jewellery shop in Bogota, Colombia in May 1970, where it was claimed he had stolen a bracelet.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Plain clothed and uniformed policemen surround England Football captain Bobby Moore, in white shirt, as he leaves the Fuego Verde jewellery shop in Bogota, Colombia in May 1970, where it was claimed he had stolen a bracelet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The nation fretted about whether Alf Ramsey\u2019s \u201cleader and right-hand man\u201d would even get to play in Mexico.

The resultant match-up was a mouthwatering prospect: continental rivalry - the current world champions against the hot favourites; a supreme defence against an unparalleled attacking force. Their <a href=\"https://footballia.net/matches/brazil-england-world-cup\">showdown in Guadalajara</a> was replayed in full about a decade ago by the BBC and more than lived up to its reputation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c352d2d5e9db4f6b10a5ae4e0d4681e018f89ad6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c352d2d5e9db4f6b10a5ae4e0d4681e018f89ad6/0_0_1900_1092/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Teams from England and Brazil line up prior to their World Cup match in the Jalisco Stadium in Mexico.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"575\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Teams from England and Brazil line up prior to their World Cup match in the Jalisco Stadium in Mexico.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1970 England were feared by everyone, including the Brazilians, who were rampant in an explosive start against Czechoslovakia, with Jairzinho, Rivelino and Pele (twice) serving notice of their intent.

  "<p>The coronavirus pandemic triggered a significant drop in applications to the UK for asylum and visas in the first quarter of the year, as well as a fall in the number of people removed from the country, official figures show.</p> <p>There were significant falls for work and study visas in March, in particular for Chinese nationals, and this was likely to be related to Covid-19, the Home Office said.</p> <p>Work visa applications were down 3% in the first three months of the year, compared with the first quarter of 2019, and, while study visa applications were up 65% in the same period, they fell significantly in March, the Home Office said.</p> <p>Overall arrivals into the UK were down 18% in the first three months of the year to 23.7m arrivals \u2013 but this figure will still alarm critics of the government\u2019s border policy in the runup to the UK lockdown.

  "<p>In the weeks and months after my kids were born, I couldn\u2019t tolerate watching violence on television. I sought out the softest, lamest shows around. I watched multi-season family dramas in which people yelled at one other, broke down, stormed off, then came back, reconciled and broke down again.</p> <p>I did two seasons of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/09/midsomer-murders-boxset\">Midsomer Murders</a>, the winsome drama that began in the late 1990s, and dug up prestige BBC shows from a decade earlier \u2013 the kind in which characters in large drawing rooms exchange brittle remarks, and all the relationships between the men had a gay subtext. I thoroughly enjoyed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/21/from-downton-abbey-to-belgravia-a-brief-guide-to-julian-fellowes\">Downton Abbey</a>.</p> <p>The pandemic has seen off our usual methods of escape, and for those of us lucky enough to be home and safe, the question of where to go in our heads can be tricky. It\u2019s unhealthy to fall down a news wormhole, but avoiding the news seems bad too. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/13/from-blyton-to-bryson-comfort-reading-to-enjoy-during-lockdown\">Novels require more peace of mind</a> than I have. And while the days are fraught with commitment \u2013 schoolwork, housework, regular work, lesson prep, the ceaseless whir of the printer and the sink full of dishes, again \u2013 they also seem aimless and without end. No one goes to bed in my house any more. If there\u2019s a minute off, it is hard to know where to go.</p> <p>It started with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/13/the-outsider-review-stephen-king-slashfest-is-like-csi-on-sleeping-pills\">The Outsider</a>, the HBO adaptation of a Stephen King book in which a shapeshifter \u2013 I talk about \u201cshapeshifters\u201d now \u2013 causes boils to break out on his victims\u2019 necks, then comes back in the form of their abusive dead mothers to taunt them. I kept waiting to lose interest, as I tend to do with horror. Instead, I was beside myself with enjoyment. I binged the series in three nights straight, thinking it was the best thing I\u2019d ever watched.</p> <p>From there, I moved on to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/26/the-terror-review-menacing-arctic-horror-series-gives-a-lasting-chill\">The Terror</a>, the Hulu show based on Sir John Franklin\u2019s doomed 1845 expedition to the Arctic. It has Ciar\u00e1n Hinds blustering about in period costume, and it illuminates an interesting period of naval history; but that wasn\u2019t it. In the second episode (spoiler alert), a demonic polar bear appears on the scene, ripping a bunch of sailors in half and putting Hinds head-first down an ice hole. Bingo.</p> <p>Since it came out, in 2018, I\u2019d been avoiding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/05/a-quiet-place-review-john-krasinski-emily-blunt\">A Quiet Place</a>, the John Krasinski alien flick in which a woman (Emily Blunt) has to give birth in perfect silence, lest she alert to her presence a bunch of flappy-legged creatures who \u201csee\u201d through their ears and eat humans. Artwork for the movie showed Blunt, wide-eyed with terror, with a hand over her mouth. God, I thought. Why do people watch this stuff?</p> <p>It\u2019s all I watch, now. Through a combination of anxiety and boredom, lethargy and fear, the only thing I\u2019m interested in is the apocalypse. In the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/week-three-isolation-kids\">early days of the lockdown</a> in New York, it was easy to watch regular TV and feel a pang of sadness and alarm at scenes in busy restaurants. Now, I couldn\u2019t care less those about those people clinking glasses or pushing their way through Times Square. They are innocent to the point of delusion.</p> <p>I don\u2019t want thoughtful internal journeys, or wistfulness or subtlety. I tried <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/26/normal-people-review-sally-rooney-bbc-hulu\">Normal People</a> and was impatient to the point of fury; this is all very well, I thought, but when is someone going to lose an arm? How could it possibly compete with something like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/30/train-to-busan-review-nonstop-thrill-ride-zombies\">Train to Busan</a>, the brilliant South Korean zombie flick in which fast-moving zombies take over a train, causing a fund manager to reboot his humanity? (\u201cAt a time like this,\u201d he tells his daughter, \u201conly look after yourself.\u201d Well, he certainly learns his lesson).</p> <p>I watched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/07/cargo-review-the-living-dead-have-us-spooked-but-in-a-painful-way\">Cargo</a>, a great Australian zombie movie starring Martin Freeman, in which, after the zombie apocalypse, only the indigenous people survive. I rewatched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2005/jul/01/1\">War of the Worlds</a>, the Tom Cruise version, in which he spends the entire movie just shouting his kids\u2019 names. It was as terrible as I remembered, but there was no denying the fact that, at the sight of the aliens gathering in a weather event behind what looks like the Long Island Expressway, I was infinitely soothed.</p> <p>I went back to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/oct/22/contagion-film-truth-viral-pandemic\">Contagion</a>, of course, Steven Soderbergh\u2019s virus movie from 2011. But, strangely, it didn\u2019t hit the spot. I don\u2019t want documentary. I don\u2019t want a show about a <em>virus</em>, unless it is extraterrestrial. Consolation only comes in watching something worse than reality, that externalises the sense of the world gone insane. I want monsters, and aliens, and armies of the undead. I want to see people being stalked by an unnamed terror. I want some reflection of savagery that won\u2019t be smoothed over, an emergency that can\u2019t be absorbed.</p> <p>\u2022 Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>A court ruling has given hope to thousands of migrants, including health and care workers, that they will no longer have to pay visa and NHS surcharge fees if they cannot afford them.</p> <p>An immigration court found that the Home Office was applying too harsh a test on whether people should be forced to pay.</p> <p>It comes as Boris Johnson faces <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/21/tory-mp-backs-labour-call-scrap-nhs-fees-migrant-health-staff\">growing pressure</a> to scrap the health surcharge for migrant health and social care workers in light of their essential role during the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>Although the Home Office has granted a free <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/home-secretary-announces-visa-extensions-for-frontline-health-and-care-workers\">one-year extension</a> to visas for migrant health and social care workers \u2013 a move estimated to benefit 3,000 workers \u2013 they will be expected to resume payments thereafter. </p> <p>The ruling on Wednesday in the upper tribunal of the immigration and asylum chamber focused on the issue of fee waivers for visa applications. The NHS surcharge forms part of this application.</p> <p>Under Home Office rules, a fee waiver is possible if applicants can prove they are destitute. But many impoverished migrants fall short of the high bar for that status.</p> <p>The court ruled that the Home Office was applying the wrong test for whether or not people should have to pay thousands of pounds for their visas and NHS surcharge. Instead of the destitution test, the court said the Home Office should be applying a test of whether applicants could afford to pay the fees, and if migrants could prove they did not have the income to pay then they should not have to do so.</p> <p>The case was brought by a family of five who have not been able to regularise their immigration status because they cannot afford the fees. They cannot afford to pay because they are not allowed to work because they have been unable to regularise their immigration status.</p> <p>The parents arrived in the UK on work visas from Ghana in 2005 and 2006. Their three children \u2013 twin boys aged nine and a daughter aged five \u2013 were all born in the UK.</p> <p>The Home Office asked the family to pay \u00a37,665 in visa fees and the health surcharge, even though the family produced evidence to the court of having just one penny in their savings account. The Home Office said they did not meet the destitution test because a friend was giving them accommodation and they were getting basic support to survive from their church and a food bank.</p> <p>A freedom of information <a href=\"https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/597463/response/1445185/attach/5/Annex%201.pdf?cookie_passthrough=1\">response</a> from the Home Office showed that between January 2015 and June 2019, 24,370 people were refused permission for a fee waiver on their visa applications. Some of these may qualify for a visa waiver in the light of this judgment, and there are likely to be many others who have not yet applied and would be eligible.</p> <p>Saul Stone, a solicitor at Duncan Lewis, said: \u201cThis is a landmark judgment which will provide some reprieve to the thousands of people who apply for waivers of extortionate Home Office fees each year.</p> <p>\u201cThis group is likely to include many low-paid migrant NHS workers who have been unable to demonstrate that they are destitute but nevertheless cannot afford the fees required to apply to stay in the UK. If you are granted a fee waiver for your immigration fees, you are also granted a fee waiver for the health surcharge \u2013 it goes hand in hand.\u201d</p> <p>The Home Office was given permission to challenge the ruling at the court of appeal. It has been contacted for comment.</p>",
  "<p>Do you want the good news or the bad news?</p> <p>The good news \u2013 both for the UK, the rest of Europe and the US \u2013 is that the worst is over. April marked the bottom of the slump triggered by the response to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19</a> pandemic. Provided there is no second wave of infection (a pretty <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/top-eu-doctor-europe-should-brace-itself-for-second-wave-of-coronavirus\">hefty qualification</a>, admittedly), last month was as bad as it gets.</p> <p>The bad news is that a return to pre-crisis levels of activity is a long way off and, as things stand, will be measured in years rather than months. There is more chance of spotting a yeti in the Himalayas than there is of a sighting of the V-shaped recovery.</p> <p>Some businesses in the UK are starting to reopen, but the process is a slow one. The Office for National Statistics says that of the companies trading in late April and early May, 6% had <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronavirustheukeconomyandsocietyfasterindicators/21may2020\">re</a><a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronavirustheukeconomyandsocietyfasterindicators/21may2020\">opened in the previous two weeks.</a></p> <p>This fits with anecdotal evidence. There are more cars on the roads, more cafes and restaurants are offering takeaway services, factories have resumed production with skeleton staff.</p> <p>It also chimes with the latest purchasing managers\u2019 indices (PMIs), which have bounced off the historic lows plumbed in April. In the UK, the PMI rose from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/may/21/markets-edgy-trump-china-uk-eurozone-recession-covid-coronavirus-economy-unemployment-business-live\">13.8 to 28.9; in the eurozone it increased from 13.6 to 30.5.</a></p> <p>Any reading of below 50.0 is supposed to represent economic contraction, so on the face of it, that means activity is still falling in May, but at a slower pace than in April. That doesn\u2019t smell right: lockdown restrictions have been eased and that will have boosted output.</p> <p>Samuel Tombs, UK economist at the economic consultancy Pantheon, has tentatively pencilled in a rise in gross domestic product of 3% in May following a 20% fall in April. That seems more like it.</p> <p>For now, the economy remains on government-provided life support. Of those firms that have temporarily closed, 91% have furloughed staff, 70% have deferred VAT payments and 62% have taken advantage of the business rates holiday. Only 11% of shuttered businesses are certain their cash reserves will last for more than six months.</p> <p>Hence <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/19/chancellor-plays-down-hopes-of-quick-economic-recovery\">Rishi Sunak</a>\u2019s keenness to get more of the economy running in the coming weeks. The other piece of good news for the chancellor is that the steadily falling trend in the growth of new Covid-19 cases should allow the government to further relax lockdown restrictions.</p> <h2>Argentina\u2019s troubles spell another sovereign debt crisis</h2> <p>It\u2019s crunch time for Argentina. The bizarre attitude of Jair Bolsonaro means that Brazil \u2013 with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/coronavirus-brazil-mexico-bolsonaro\">third highest number</a> of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19</a> cases in the world \u2013 has been the Latin American country hogging the headlines, but its next-door neighbour has the more immediate problem.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/dozens-poorer-nations-seek-imf-help-coronavirus-crisis\">The International Monetary Fund </a>is worried about Argentina, and has every reason to be. The government in Buenos Aires missed a payment in April on the $65bn (\u00a353bn) that it owes to its international creditors and the grace period runs out on Friday. Without a compromise deal or an agreement to extend the deadline, Argentina will be in default for the ninth time in its history.</p> <p>This matters, and not just for Argentina. There are many countries in the world struggling with collapsing demand, pressures to spend more on creaking health systems and the spiralling costs of servicing debt.</p> <p>Three things need to happen. Firstly, private creditors, who own 41% of the debt, need to cut a deal along the lines of that offered by the Argentine government. Secondly, the IMF needs to ratchet up the pressure on its member states for an allocation of its own reserve currency \u2013 special drawing rights \u2013 which hard-pressed countries could convert into US dollars in order to help meet their debt repayments. Finally, there needs to be a mechanism whereby countries can declare themselves insolvent, just as companies can.</p> <p>As things stand, a sovereign debt crisis of the sort not seen since the 1980s is looming.</p>",
  "<p>Every day, I wake at the crack of dawn. I walk to my local hospital, put on my scrubs and my PPE. I sweat in it \u2013 mopping floors, disinfecting surfaces, cleaning everything that might be touched by a hand. I am aware that if I miss a spot, the virus might stay on the surface, and someone might die. At the end of the day I return home to my partner, exhausted \u2013 emotionally, as much as physically \u2013 put moisturiser on my hands, which are cracked and dry from the cleaning products, and fall asleep.</p> \n<p>This is my daily routine now. Before the coronavirus pandemic, I was a photographer and film-maker. But when the impact of Covid-19 started to become clear, I put that work on hold and looked for a more immediate way to help my community. I saw my local hospital, Whipps Cross, was looking for cleaners. I applied, was interviewed and trained, and began work there that same week.</p> \n<p>Yesterday, while scrolling through my phone on the walk into work, I saw <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/coronavirus-nhs-cleaners-leave-to-remain-scheme-home-office-a9523111.html\">an article that read</a>: \u201cNHS porters, cleaners and social care staff have been left out of a Home Office scheme granting families of health workers indefinite leave to remain in the UK if they die of coronavirus\u201d. It felt like I\u2019d been slapped across the face. My partner and I are both Syrian. To know that, should the worst happen to me, she would not be granted indefinite leave to remain, was indescribably hurtful. I also thought of my colleagues and their families, all of whom are incredibly important to me. While I\u2019ve done this job for just under two months, most of them have been doing it for years, if not decades. They are from all over the world: Spain, Ghana, Poland, Nigeria, Italy, the Caribbean, India. Their expertise and dedication inspires me every day.</p> \n<p>During my lunch break, I sat in my car and, out of desperation, filmed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hassan_akkad/status/1263081676890148864\">a plea to our prime minister</a>. I told him that although \u201cI\u2019ve been really enjoying the clapping that you and your fellow ministers in the government do every week, today, however, I felt betrayed, stabbed in the back.\u201d I posted it on Twitter, and within a few hours it had nearly a million views. Thousands were resharing it, voicing their solidarity with, and admiration for, the people who turn up each day at their frontline jobs and risk their lives to keep the country running.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"789aa69b-6164-468e-aa83-a6f823567551\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XkwnN2wPy1w?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Then something happened. Five hours after I posted my initial tweet, the home secretary <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pritipatel/status/1263153647791284224?s=20\">announced</a> a U-turn: the bereavement scheme was to be expanded to include all NHS support staff and their families, effective immediately and retrospectively. This action was a result of the work of pressure from unions and politicians, as well as everyone who spoke out.</p> \n<p>I am moved by the countless responses to my video from members of the public who are passionate about ensuring every worker and their family has access to an equal level of protection. This is bigger than the scheme being expanded to include NHS support staff. This is a demonstration that the country has the ability to change. To use our experiences of the pandemic to care more deeply for one another, and to take the concrete actions needed to improve the lives of both migrant workers and other marginalised communities through the UK.</p> \n<p>There is still a lot of work to do. To only include support staff in the scheme following a public outcry is not enough \u2013 the government must do more to protect key workers. Health workers are still dying on the frontline, with the recorded total \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/doctors-nurses-porters-volunteers-the-uk-health-workers-who-have-died-from-covid-19\">nearly 200 at the time of writing</a> \u2013 now <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/fields-of-operation/iraq\">exceeding the number</a> (179) of British military personnel who died in the Iraq war. A disproportionate number of BAME staff have died, and we know that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/racial-inequality-in-britain-found-a-risk-factor-for-covid-19\">minority groups are overrepresented</a> by up to 27% in the overall Covid-19 death toll.</p> \n<p>In addition to these risks, we know that there are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/19/foreign-nhs-workers-coronavirus-frontline-nhs-surcharge\">153,000 non-British nationals working for the NHS</a>, who will be taxed double to access health services because of their immigration status \u2013 once through income tax and then through the immigration health surcharge. We want to support the NHS, but also to be able to use it in our own times of need without prohibitive costs stopping us.</p> \n<p>I will continue to use my platform as much as possible, to open spaces for discussion on how we can create a more fair, inclusive, and kind society that recognises the contributions those from all over the world make not just to the NHS, but to our country as a whole. I hope you will join me in this effort.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Hassan Akkad is an award winning film-maker, photojournalist and activist who was displaced from Syria in 2012.

In a Little While (2001)</h2> <p>Once they had shaken off their youthful obsession with Siouxsie and the Banshees and Joy Division, U2 seldom sounded like anyone other than U2. In a Little While, however, has a 70s Rolling Stones feel to it. Subsequently covered by both Hanson and William Shatner, it\u2019s a lovely, loose ode to enduring romance.</p> <h2>37. Out of Control (1980)</h2> <p>U2\u2019s debut single is very much a product of its era, further bedevilled by the difficult recording session at which the band\u2019s own technical limitations were revealed. Re-recorded for 1980\u2019s Boy, however, Out of Control shone, its blazing youthful power fully revealed itself.</p> <h2>36. Sleep Like a Baby Tonight (2014)</h2> <p>The contents of Songs of Innocence were overshadowed by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/sep/10/u2-apple-launch-means-band-and-company-songs-of-innocence\">controversy over its means of distribution</a> \u2013 oddly enough, not everyone wanted a U2 album to automatically appear in their iTunes library \u2013 but they were better than the reviews suggested: produced by Danger Mouse, Sleep Like a Baby Tonight\u2019s lambent tune and electronic pulse deserve reassessment.</p> <h2>35. The Playboy Mansion (1997)</h2> <p>Another song worth salvaging from the wreckage of Pop, the drum machine-driven The Playboy Mansion is raggedly charming, its lyrics casting an ambiguous eye over media bombardment, celebrity and advertising, its guitar snaking around Bono\u2019s low-key vocal.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDl1c0nR5SI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IDl1c0nR5SI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>34. Hold Me Thrill Me Kiss Me Kill Me (1995)</h2> <p>U2\u2019s contribution to the soundtrack of Batman Forever might well be their own charming homage to Marc Bolan, albeit put through a distinct Zooropa-era filter: the string arrangement is pure Children of the Revolution, the guitars crunch very T Rex-ily, there\u2019s a distinct hint of a <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0s0LRAzjXUyFgxstSrxVke\">\u201cglam descend\u201d</a> chord sequence about the chorus.</p> <h2>33. Cedars of Lebanon (2009)</h2> <p>Cursed with the kind of title guaranteed to get U2 naysayers rolling their eyes, Cedars of Lebanon is nevertheless one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/feb/27/u2-no-line-on-horizon\">No Line on the Horizon</a>\u2019s scattered highlights: sonically muted and misty, the vocals oddly conversational, its tone weary and sombre, it feels focused and potent where the rest of the album feels confused.</p> <h2>32. Invisible (2014)</h2> <p>Kraftwerk apparently lurked among the regular musical diet of the nascent U2, but it took until 2014 for their influence to really make itself heard. Invisible\u2019s blend of classic U2-isms with motorik drums and Autobahn synths is the most successful of their recent attempts to reboot their sound.</p> <h2>31. Mothers of the Disappeared (1987)</h2> <p>There\u2019s a sense that U2\u2019s vast commercial success means their willingness to experiment gets overlooked, but The Joshua Tree\u2019s second side is thick with impressive diversions into the musical left field, as evidenced by its closing track\u2019s ominous, chilling ambient noise.</p> <h2>30. Stay (Faraway, So Close!) (1993)</h2> <p>As befits a song originally intended for Frank Sinatra, Stay pared back the sonic overload of much of Zooropa, leaving U2 more or less au naturel. Its live sound bolsters the song\u2019s beautifully elegant, elegiac, small-hours tone, its lyric inspired by the plot of the <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107209/\">Wim Wenders film </a>they wrote it for.</p> <h2>29. October (1981)</h2> <p>At the other extreme to Gloria\u2019s breast-beating lurked October\u2019s title track, an austere, suitably autumnal-sounding piano ballad in which Bono\u2019s vocals arrive only in the final 50 seconds. \u201cJoy Division had gone to our heads,\u201d shrugged the singer years later, but there\u2019s a hushed, stark beauty to the track.</p> <h2>28. Get Out of Your Own Way (2017)</h2> <p>U2\u2019s most recent albums have been marred by the audible sense of a band trying too hard, but Songs of Experience\u2019s highlight felt effortless. Its shifts from soft and sad to rousing are the sound of a band not worrying about their place in the modern pop landscape and being themselves.</p> <h2>27. Until the End of the World (1991)</h2> <p>A fantastic example of Achtung Baby\u2019s ability to adapt current musical trends so they fit into U2\u2019s universe, rather than vice-versa, the shuffling, vaguely \u201cbaggy\u201d dance rhythm here supports a retelling of the story of Judas Iscariot, a song that alternately broods and soars and a particularly sky-scraping Edge solo.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHcP4MWABGY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LHcP4MWABGY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>26. Pride (In the Name of Love) (1984)</h2> <p>The song that in effect sent U2 supernova plays fast and loose with the facts of Martin Luther King\u2019s murder \u2013 he was shot in the afternoon, not the morning \u2013 but it hardly matters. As straightforward a lunge for anthem status as they had yet recorded, Pride worked.</p> <h2>25. City of Blinding Lights (2004)</h2> <p>Either a paean to Bono\u2019s goggle-eyed first trip to London, or a description of Manhattan, City of Blinding Lights isn\u2019t about taking risks so much as U2 doing what U2 were put on Earth to do \u2013 make music that\u2019s atmospheric but anthemic, uplifting but soul-searching \u2013 and doing it absolutely perfectly.</p> <h2>24. Ultraviolet (Light My Way) (1991)</h2> <p>Julian Schnabel\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/feb/08/worldcinema.drama\">The Diving Bell and the Butterfly</a> features a scene soundtracked by Ultraviolet: the film\u2019s paralysed protagonist remembering a car journey with his lover, her hair flowing in the wind. It is an extraordinary piece of film-making that perfectly captures Ultraviolet\u2019s power, the most musically uplifting of U2\u2019s examinations of faith.</p> <h2>25. Mofo (1997)</h2> <p>Pop is generally regarded as U2\u2019s latter-day nadir: its recording was rushed, its attempt at grafting samples and loops on to U2\u2019s sound ungainly, and even its title managed to upset US rock fans. But occasionally, it worked, as on Mofo, an improbably titled song about the death of Bono\u2019s mother, complete with thrilling, Giorgio Moroder-ish synth line.</p> <h2>24. The Electric Co (1980)</h2> <p>U2 have been resident in the world\u2019s stadiums for so long, it is easy to forget they were once a post-punk band. (They would doubtless argue they still are.) It is very clear here, a song about alienation and electro-convulsive therapy, vocals hidden amid trebly, reverb-heavy guitars, drums heavy on tom-tom thunder.</p> <h2>23. Stuck in a Moment You Can\u2019t Get Out Of (2000)</h2> <p>At the other emotional extreme to Beautiful Day lies All That You Can\u2019t Leave Behind\u2019s anguished response to the death of Michael Hutchence. More complex and affecting than a standard issue tear-jerker, its lyric keeps shifting from sadness and empathy to anger at its subject: \u201cYou\u2019re such a fool.\u201d</p> <h2>22. Zooropa (1993)</h2> <p>Zooropa was Achtung Baby\u2019s scrappier sibling: if you wanted evidence of the distance U2 had travelled in recent years, the title track\u2019s experimental, episodic collision of ambience, distorted vocals and densely affected guitar was a good place to start. Moreover, they somehow did it without surrendering their, well, U2-ness.</p> <h2>21. Bullet the Blue Sky (1987)</h2> <p>Inspired by a trip to El Salvador, Bullet the Blue Sky\u2019s tribal drums, dub bass and arcs of guitar noise sound like a bold attempt to turn the experiments of post-punk into something stadium-sized. Extra fun can be had imagining Mark E Smith\u2019s reaction when he learned the chorus was based on a Fall track.</p> <h2>20. Gloria (1981)</h2> <p>U2\u2019s second album could have been their last \u2013 a confused exploration of spirituality, it nearly pre-empted a split \u2013 but when it worked, as on towering opener Gloria, it underlined what a different proposition U2 were. Who else among their peers would write an open-hearted, earnest celebration of Christian faith?</p> <h2>19. The Troubles (2017)</h2> <p>Not all of U2\u2019s recent lunges for contemporaneity have worked (who in their right minds wants to hear Bono singing through Auto-Tune?) but Songs of Innocence\u2019s concluding duet with Lykke Li did. A slow drift that never deals directly with the conflict in the title, but focuses on the impact that growing up near conflict has on one\u2019s personality.</p> <h2>18. The Fly (1991)</h2> <p>From its opening blast of chaotic guitar, The Fly boldly announces things are not as they were in the world of U2. Out goes earnestness that could border on painful, in come more murky, ambiguous songs sung in character. \u201cConscience can be a pest,\u201d offers Bono, as if starkly critiquing his former self, \u201cambition bites the nails of success.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8rQ575DWD8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z8rQ575DWD8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>17. Desire (1988)</h2> <p>Rattle and Hum marked the point at which U2 allowed their passion and self-belief \u2013 and indeed their reaction to superstardom \u2013 to slip into bombast, but sometimes its experiments with US roots music work. Fizzing with their enthusiasm for music forbidden under post-punk\u2019s rules, Desire\u2019s irresistible Bo Diddley beat is evidence.</p> <h2>16. Bad (1984)</h2> <p>Inspired by the rise in heroin use in 80s Dublin, Bad looms large in U2 legend. The original is hypnotic and slow-burning, delicately shaded with Brian Eno\u2019s electronics, the perfect launchpad for onstage development. Most famously, they <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvBgRSSlVBA\">played it for 12 minutes at Live Aid</a>, a performance they thought was a disaster, but which turned out to be a highlight.</p> <h2>15. I Will Follow (1980)</h2> <p>U2\u2019s first truly great song was a product of its era \u2013 Public Image-esque guitars, the vocal influence of Siouxsie particularly evident on the chorus, a hint of DIY experimentation in its percussive use of cutlery and a bicycle wheel \u2013 but it hoisted its influences into the service of music expressly built for crowds to sing along and punch the air to.</p> <h2>14. New Year\u2019s Day (1983)</h2> <p>The unexpected result of Adam Clayton attempting, and failing, to play the bass line to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMPR6Ujop4k\">Visage\u2019s Fade to Grey</a>, U2\u2019s breakthrough hit had what Bono admitted was a sketchy lyric about Poland\u2019s political upheavals. It didn\u2019t matter: its anthem status rests on the emotional shift between the jagged iciness of its verses and the warmth and yearning of the chorus.</p> <h2>13. Sometimes You Can\u2019t Make It on Your Own (2004)</h2> <p>How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\u2019s greatest track remains Bono\u2019s rumination on his complex relationship with his dying father. It\u2019s the perfect counter-argument to those who feel U2\u2019s music exists solely on a grand scale, painted in emotional brushstrokes too broad for its own good. Incisive and personal, it is heartbreakingly frank.</p> <h2>12. Lemon (1993)</h2> <p>Achtung Baby\u2019s singles employed a lot of hip dance remixers: the shimmering synths and falsetto vocals of Zooropa\u2019s Lemon seemed to seamlessly integrate the sound of a hip dance remix into U2\u2019s own. It is helped by the fact the song itself is great; you could strip it of its production and it would still work.</p> <h2>11. Even Better Than the Real Thing (1991)</h2> <p>Returning to Achtung Baby\u2019s many remixes, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRQg1R4jiwk\">Paul Oakenfold\u2019s version </a>of Even Better Than the Real Thing was the most famous, but then his source material was fantastic: a rattlingly exciting song about the desire for immediate gratification \u2013 \u201cSlide down the surface of things\u201d \u2013 that now seems remarkably prescient.</p> <h2>10. No Line on the Horizon (2009)</h2> <p>A commercial disappointment \u2013 selling a mere 5m copies \u2013 the album No Line on the Horizon was muddled and, in Larry Mullen\u2019s words, \u201cfucking miserable\u201d. Finding its highlights requires a degree of sifting, but its title track is fantastic: a wracked vocal over a pulsing wall of guitar effects, the intensity of which ebbs and flows throughout the song.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co6WMzDOh1o\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/co6WMzDOh1o?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>9. Beautiful Day (2000)</h2> <p>Trailed as a return to basics after the failed experiment of Pop, All That You Can\u2019t Leave Behind wasn\u2019t quite as straightforward as that, but U2 songs come no more direct and powerful than its lead single. Everything about Beautiful Day clicks perfectly, the apparent effortlessness of its widescreen euphoria at odds with its tricky gestation.</p> <h2>8. The Unforgettable Fire (1984)</h2> <p>By now, U2 could knock out potent stadium rock to order, as evidenced by Pride, but The Unforgettable Fire\u2019s best moments are more opaque, less direct. The title track is atmospheric, synth-heavy and dense with serpentine melodies, its euphoric power gradually building over the course of five minutes.</p> <h2>7. I Still Haven\u2019t Found What I\u2019m Looking For (1987)</h2> <p>The gospel inflections and earnest tone of I Still Haven\u2019t Found What I\u2019m Looking For are precisely the kind of thing that winds up U2\u2019s detractors. But blessed with a melody that sounds it has somehow always existed, its strength lies in the fact that it doesn\u2019t deal in pious sermonising; its expressions of spiritual doubt are disarmingly heartfelt.</p> <h2>6. All I Want Is You (1988)</h2> <p>Of all Rattle And Hum\u2019s attempts to tap into American music history, employing former Beach Boys collaborator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/09/van-dyke-parks-victimised-brian-wilson-buffoonery\">Van Dyke Parks</a> for All I Want Is You was the most inspired. His complex but beautiful string arrangement turns a straightforward love song into something richer, adding an undercurrent of uncertainty to Bono\u2019s vocal proclamations.</p> <h2>5. Sunday Bloody Sunday (1983)</h2> <p>A lot has been written about Sunday Bloody Sunday\u2019s lyrics \u2013 a non-sectarian, pacifist view of the Troubles \u2013 but its power lies in the way its sound keeps lurching back and forth from a clattering racket strafed with feedback and scraping violin to something more straightforward and palatable: a killer riff coupled with the singalong-inducing refrain: \u201cHow long must we sing this song?\u201d</p> <h2>4. With Or Without You (1987)</h2> <p>Daringly at odds with then-prevalent trends for pumped-up and musclebound stadium rock, With Or Without You\u2019s examination of faith and/or love is simple to the point of sounding stark: subtle, even subdued, never reaching the big climax you expect. None of which stopped it going to No 1 in the US, a very counterintuitive way of becoming the biggest band in the world.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/21/u2-review-manchester-arena-experience-innocence-tour\">U2 review \u2013 eye-popping show finds rock icons at their most human</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>3. Mysterious Ways (1991)</h2> <p>\u201cHeavy-bottomed but light-headed\u201d in the words of the producer Brian Eno, Mysterious Ways is one of a number of Achtung Baby tracks to bear the influence of contemporary indie-dance, an inspiration U2 were able to assimilate remarkably well, hence this gleefully lubricious blast of wah-wah guitar, congas and funky bass.</p> <h2>2. One (1991)</h2> <p>Achtung Baby is rightly heralded as one of the great 180-degree artistic turns a major band has ever performed, but at its heart lies a traditionally U2-esque song: a love ballad that reaches for bigger topics \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re one, but we\u2019re not the same, we get to carry each other\u201d \u2013 so emotionally powerful it apparently reduced Axl Rose, of all people, to floods of tears.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzZWSrr5wFI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GzZWSrr5wFI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>1. Where the Streets Have No Name (1987)</h2> <p>Where the Streets Have No Name had inauspicious beginnings: in effect written to order \u2013 The Joshua Tree was \u201cshort [of] a certain kind of song\u201d, the Edge later recalled \u2013 the band struggled to record it, and Eno was so unimpressed he attempted to wipe the tape. He would have erased a song that perfectly sums up U2\u2019s appeal. Powered by a particularly gripping example of Edge\u2019s patent echo-drenched arpeggios, it is breathlessly exciting without ever resorting to rock anthem cliche (the time signature changes twice). The lyrics seem to be as much about the ability of music to inspire joyful transcendence as the divisions in Belfast that inspired them and the chorus soars irresistibly. \u201cThe ultimate U2 live song,\u201d Edge suggested. He was right.</p> <p><em>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 May to state that The Troubles came from Songs of Innocence rather than Songs of Experience</em></p>",

  "<p>It was built by Sir Edwin Lutyens as the grand imperial heart of India, then reclaimed as the seat of power for an independent republic.</p> <p>Now, government plans to redevelop Delhi\u2019s emblematic central vista and build a new parliament have drawn fierce criticism.</p> <p>Writing in the Guardian, the acclaimed Indian-born sculptor Anish Kapoor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/21/modi-the-fanatic-is-using-the-coronavirus-crisis-to-destroy-indias-heritage\">has described the plans to rebuild the nation\u2019s power corridor as an act of \u201cpolitical fanaticism\u201d</a> by Narendra Modi, India\u2019s Hindu-nationalist prime minister.</p> <p>The \u201cexpensive vanity project\u201d, Kapoor writes, is Modi\u2019s \u201cway of placing himself at the centre and cementing his legacy as the ruler-maker-builder of a new Hindu India\u201d.</p> <p>The project, added Kapoor, is going ahead \u201cwithout an articulated architectural position, public consultation, parliamentary debate or peer consent\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32fb40da88fa4bac67b3a346e5a7a0d28a198478\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32fb40da88fa4bac67b3a346e5a7a0d28a198478/0_254_5641_3383/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A worker cleans the lawn at Parliament House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A worker cleans the lawn at Parliament House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hindustan Times/Hindustan Times via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Delhi\u2019s central vista, home to the grand complex of government buildings, is one of the most recognisable sites in India. The long and grassy avenue sweeps down from the India Gate war memorial to the Rashtrapati Bhavan, or president\u2019s residence, with the circular Parliament House building in between. It was designed by British architects Lutyens and Herbert Baker following the 1911 decision to move the capital of the British Raj from Calcutta to Delhi.</p> <p>The geometric design, with wide avenues and sprawling lawns, was modelled on European capitals such as Paris but was also infused with Indian influences from the architecture of Hindu temples to the red-stoned grandeur of Mughal forts. The vista remains the only area in India designated grade 1 heritage status.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a71fb085488971475cdb14e9866e3e9ab1252558\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a71fb085488971475cdb14e9866e3e9ab1252558/0_0_4380_2920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump reviews a guard of honour during a ceremonial reception at Rashtrapati Bhavan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump reviews a guard of honour during a ceremonial reception at Rashtrapati Bhavan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now, under a $3bn development plan, over the next four years an entirely new triangular parliament building will be erected next to the current heritage Parliament House, which was built in 1929, as well as a new residence for the prime minister. It will repurpose the north and south blocks into a national museum, demolish some newer ministry buildings and erect a vast new secretariat along either side of the vista, which will house all the government ministries currently scattered across Delhi. It will be the most significant transformation of the physical structures of government in India since independence; yet according to many opponents, it is not needed at all.</p> <p>The government and HCP Design, the architecture firm overseeing the project, say its necessity is not up for dispute. \u201cFrom the day after independence, parliament was too small, because the existing building was the council house for the British raj,\u201d said Bobby Desai, director of design at HCP. \u201cWe have limped along since then. It was certainly never designed to be a parliament building for a country of 1.4 billion people.\u201d</p> <p>Currently 550 representatives sit in the parliament, but is still based on the 1971 census when India\u2019s population was a just 580 million, meaning a single elected official now looks after an average of 2.5 million people. This will be up for review after 2026 and there are estimates it could raise the number of parliamentarians to over 900, thus requiring more seats.</p> <p>But opponents to the project have questioned why the Indian government cannot follow the example of ageing parliament buildings all over the world, from the French parliament to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/dec/01/a-tale-of-decay-the-houses-of-parliament-are-falling-down\">Houses of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/dec/01/a-tale-of-decay-the-houses-of-parliament-are-falling-down\">Parliament in the UK </a>and the Senate in the US, and renovate the current structure, which is less than 100 years old.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4286a7a438bc0058ce7b3a84a98a09799332158d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4286a7a438bc0058ce7b3a84a98a09799332158d/0_0_3000_2002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Central Secretariat in Delhi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Central Secretariat in Delhi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: jacus/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Desai insisted that it was unsafe to do so, and that an entirely new building was the only option. \u201cThe current building has heritage status and physically can not be expanded any further, without being incredibly invasive,\u201d he said. HCP say their design will also create 75 acres more of public green space, including part of presidential estate being opened up for the first time as an arboretum showcasing India\u2019s biodiversity.</p> <p>With Delhi currently the most polluted city in the world, many have questioned why there are funds for this grandiose development but not to clean the city\u2019s toxic air. The coronavirus pandemic, and the massive financial strain it has put on India and its millions of migrant workers, has led many to argue that the billions could now be better spent on urgently needed healthcare and welfare. However, a petition for the vista development to be delayed due to the pandemic was rejected by the Supreme Court last week.</p> <p>\u201cEverything about this project has been flawed,\u201d said Anuj Srivastava, an architect who has been part of Lokpath, a group opposing the development. \u201cThere has been no transparency, no consultation and they are pushing forward with it so fast just so they can get it done before the next election. It\u2019s clearly nothing but a vanity project for prime minister Modi, to build parliament in his own image, at an unaffordable cost.. </p> <p>\u201cA heritage area like this is under strict architectural control but that seems to have been completely disregarded,\u201d Srivastava added. \u201cThe government is riding roughshod over all the committees and bodies which are supposedly meant to protect this area.\u201d</p> <p>The selection process that awarded the project to HCP, a firm known for their close ties to Modi, was accused of a lack of transparency.</p> <p>Desai acknowledged that there had been \u201cobjections\u201d to the lack of public consultation on a project. \u201cI\u2019m not saying we have absolutely achieved the mark of how public consultation should happen in these projects,\u201d said an HCP project spokesperson. \u201cI think there is some lack from both ends, both from us and also from the end of the government.\u201d</p> <p>Historian Sohail Hashmi said the project was problematic on both a practical and symbolic level. For the first time, it will see all government buildings concentrated in a single place. \u201cWe should be talking about distributing power and instead we have a design which will be the very embodiment of the concentration of power,\u201d said Hashmi. \u201cA monument to a crazed dictatorial desire to have all government in one place, under the watch of one man \u2013 our prime minister.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 May 2020. Rashtrapati Bhavan is the president\u2019s residence not the prime minister\u2019s. A photograph caption wrongly described the Central Secretariat in Delhi as the Indian parliament building.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/lana-del-rey\">Lana Del Rey</a> has hit out at the accusations that she \u201cglamorises abuse\u201d that have trailed her throughout her decade-long career. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CAcQPuBJdir/\">In a lengthy text post to her Instagram account</a>, the 34-year-old singer criticised \u201cfemale writers and alt singers\u201d who she says have blamed her \u201cminor lyrical exploration detailing my sometimes submissive or passive roles in my relationships\u201d for \u201c[setting] women back hundreds of years\u201d.</p> <p>She wrote: \u201cIn reality I\u2019m just a glamorous person singing about the realities of what we are all now seeing are very prevalent emotionally abusive relationships all over the world.\u201d She said she had been \u201chonest and optimistic\u201d about her \u201cchallenging\u201d relationships: \u201cNews flash! That\u2019s just how it is for many women.\u201d</p> <p>From the release of her major label debut album, Born to Die, in 2012, critics have dwelt on what they perceived to be Del Rey\u2019s regressive sexual politics. The influential online music site Pitchfork said of the album: \u201cYou\u2019d be hard pressed to find any song on which Del Rey reveals an interiority or figures herself as anything more complex than an ice-cream-cone-licking object of male desire.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/20/kim-gordon-lana-del-rey-doesnt-even-know-what-feminism-is\">In a leaked draft of Kim Gordon\u2019s 2015 memoir</a>, Girl in a Band, the Sonic Youth co-founder claimed that Del Rey \u201cdoesn\u2019t even know what feminism is\u201d. Gordon wrote: \u201cToday we have someone like Lana Del Rey \u2026 who believes women can do whatever they want, which, in her world, tilts toward self-destruction, whether it\u2019s sleeping with gross old men or getting gang raped by bikers. Equal pay and equal rights would be nice.\u201d The section on Del Rey was deleted from the final published version of the book.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CAcQPuBJdir/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Goodrich had gotten poor grades in high school and only began his undergraduate studies at age 24.</p> <p>Married for 50 years, the Goodriches never had children, in part because Goodrich\u2019s medical training extended into his 40s, Judy said, but he found deep fulfillment working in pediatrics.</p> <p>\u201cHe was totally taken by wanting to help children who had facial abnormalities or deformities [by] making their lives better,\u201d she said.

Poll results from mid-March had shown black respondents were actually more likely than white respondents to see coronavirus as a serious threat to their own health, he said.</p> <p>After crowds of mask-less white protesters had started showing up at state capitols, the claims that black people not taking the virus seriously vanished, Kendi said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s hard, when you have so many white people who are protesting, to argue that they are taking it more seriously</p> <footer> <cite>Ibram X Kendi</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard, when you have so many white people who are protesting and not social distancing, to argue that they are taking it more seriously and that\u2019s why they are less likely to die,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But the same argument that black Americans were to blame for dying simply evolved, Kendi said, to focus more on their \u201cpre-existing conditions\u201d.</p> <p>In Louisiana, Senator Bill Cassidy, a white Republican and a medical doctor, had already cast doubt on whether inequities rooted in systemic racism were the reason so many black Louisiana citizens were dying of coronavirus. \u201cThat\u2019s rhetoric,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/04/07/828715984/sen-bill-cassidy-on-his-states-racial-disparites-in-coronavirus-deaths\">told NPR</a> in early April. The real answer, the answer backed by science, was that \u201cAfrican Americans are 60% more likely to have diabetes\u201d and that \u201cwe need to address the obesity epidemic\u201d.</p> <p>Addressing coronavirus disparities by suggesting that people lose weight did not actually make sense, said Finn Gardiner, an advocate at the Lurie Institute for Disability Policy at Brandeis University. On what time frame were at-risk Americans supposed to become thinner in order to protect themselves from a pandemic already in their communities?</p> <p>But Cassidy\u2019s fat-shaming was familiar, Gardiner said, a way for some Americans to watch the unfolding death while avoiding any responsibility. Americans of all races with larger bodies were left feeling \u201cexpendable\u201d, that they were \u201c<a href=\"https://disabilityvisibilityproject.com/2020/03/30/fatphobia-ableism-and-the-covid-19-pandemic/\">an acceptable sacrifice</a>\u201d, he wrote.</p> <p>Blaming the victims of American racial disparities for what they suffer has a reliable outcome: nothing is done.

Blaming dead people of color for being sinful, rather than trying to fix underlying problems, only leads to many more people dying.</p> <p>Metzl argued in his book Dying of Whiteness that the way racism has shaped gun policy and healthcare choices in this country has led to outcomes that hurt black and brown Americans, but that also led to measurable increases in the deaths of white Americans. Today, he\u2019s afraid that same dynamic is playing out again.</p> <p>But there has only been a \u201cdamning\u201d silence from the White House, Metzl said, on any plan to fix the disparities that are leading to tens of thousands of deaths.</p> <p>It\u2019s not easy to describe what it\u2019s like to be forced to witness the violent repetitions of American history. Listening to other Americans argue that you are responsible for your own death, that your body is inherently expendable, takes a particular toll, said Gardiner, the disability rights advocate, who is black.</p> <p>The Puritans had a form of torture called \u201cpressing\u201d, used during the Salem witch trials. They made the accused person lie on the ground, and then very slowly, over many days, placed one rock on their chest, and then another.</p> <p>The terror for Americans now is not that coronavirus is an unprecedented challenge: it\u2019s that all this is so devastatingly familiar.</p>",

  "<p>With the economy in tatters, corruption scandals piling up \u2013 and a recent mass murder conviction to add to his previous guilty verdicts for drug trafficking, it seemed until recently that President Desi Bouterse\u2019s 40-year grip on power in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/suriname\">Suriname</a> was coming to an end.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/30/suriname-president-guilty-of-over-1982-executions\">Suriname president guilty of murder over 1982 executions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But as South America\u2019s smallest country heads into an election on 25 May, the Covid-19 pandemic may have thrown him a lifeline.</p> <p>Bouterse is the great survivor of South American politics \u2013 and its most outrageous outlaw. After coming to power as the leader of a 1980 coup, Bouterse ruled as military dictator before adopting a behind-the-scenes role in the 1990s and 2000s.</p> <p>He was elected president in 2010, proving uniquely able to win support across the many ethnic groups that make up the former Dutch colony\u2019s population of half a million. He was re-elected at the head of his National Democratic party (NDP) with a smaller margin in 2015.</p> <p>Over his last decade in office, he has tried to delay and disrupt a legal case over his role in the 1982 murder of 15 prominent opposition members at Fort Zeelandia, a pink-brick fortified chateau in Paramaribo, the capital. But in December <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/30/suriname-president-guilty-of-over-1982-executions\">a military court found him guilty of murder</a>.</p> <p>He is appealing the decision and looks unlikely to see the inside of a cell, but the verdict marked a victory for the opposition.</p> <p>\u201cThat the president could be convicted by an independent court is a compliment to the independence of our justice system. It shows that no one is above the law,\u201d said Chan Santokhi, leader of the opposition Progressive Reform party (known by its Dutch initials VHP) \u2013 and a former chief of police who led the investigation into the murders.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"57c522fd887c0c74671fe54ce0672f452c293371\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57c522fd887c0c74671fe54ce0672f452c293371/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protestors demonstrate against corruption in the government of President Desi Bouterse in Paramaribo, Suriname on 17 February 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protestors demonstrate against corruption in the government of President Desi Bouterse in Paramaribo, Suriname, on 17 February 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ranu Abhelakh/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The criminal dealings of the Bouterse family are widely known. In 1999 Dutch courts convicted Bouterse in absentia of smuggling nearly <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1999-07-18-9907180234-story.html\">half a ton of cocaine</a> into the country, meaning he can no longer travel to countries with extradition treaties with the Netherlands.</p> <p>His son, Dino, currently resides in a Mississippi prison cell, having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/10/suriname-presidents-son-sentenced-hezbollah-proposal-new-york\">offered Suriname as a base for Hezbollah operations</a> to DEA agents working a sting. In 2011 Bouterse granted a pardon to his foster son, Romano Meriba, who had been convicted in 2005 <a href=\"https://www.stabroeknews.com/2011/12/29/news/guyana/controversy-as-bouterse-grants-pardon-to-foster-son/\">of the murder of a Chinese trader and of throwing a hand grenade at the Dutch ambassador\u2019s residence</a>.</p> <p>Such scandals have not dented Bouterse\u2019s appeal. With the no-nonsense aspect of a heavyweight boxer and a melodious voice he deploys in man-of-the-people speeches and impressive Frank Sinatra renditions, Bouterse cultivates a lovable tough-guy image that has won him widespread popularity among working-class Surinamers.</p> <p>But if his persona reminded some of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/hugo-chavez\">Hugo Ch\u00e1vez</a> \u2013 who he considered a friend and ally until the Venezuelan president\u2019s death in 2013 \u2013 then so, too, did his fiscal profligacy and disdain for democratic institutions. He boosted social spending and doled out public sector jobs to allies even as gold and aluminium exports \u2013 the country\u2019s primary source of revenue \u2013 tanked.</p> <p>To cover the cracks, the government raised more than $1.5bn in Chinese loans, development finance and a $550m 10-year bond from Oppenheimer, a New York investment bank.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9ae2ec7b765c2742bd560ccfc4f065058f526a8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ae2ec7b765c2742bd560ccfc4f065058f526a8c/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Supporters of Suriname\u2019s President Desi Bouterse (not pictured) react as he addresses them after appearing in court in Paramaribo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supporters of Suriname\u2019s President Desi Bouterse (not pictured) react as he addresses them after appearing in court in Paramaribo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ranu Abhelakh/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It wasn\u2019t enough. The currency collapsed, the major credit ratings agencies devalued Suriname to junk status and by May, the Oppenheimer bonds were trading at 35% of their original price. According to Winston Ramautarsing, head of the Surinamese Society of Economists, 38% of government income goes to servicing debt. \u201cThe situation is unsustainable, we don\u2019t have enough income to pay local salaries and \u2013 having taken expensive loans from all over \u2013 we are now going to pay the true cost,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In February the situation came to a head when <a href=\"https://www.kaieteurnewsonline.com/2020/02/06/us100-million-vanishes-at-surinames-central-bank/\">a $100m hole in foreign currency reserves was discovered after the Central Bank</a> had ordered commercial banks to place 50% of deposits with them.</p> <p>\u201cWe warned the banks that the Central Bank was broke and not to be trusted \u2013 it hasn\u2019t published a report since 2014 \u2013 but they didn\u2019t listen, and the Central Bank used the savers\u2019 foreign exchange to cover the government\u2019s imports,\u201d said Ramautarsing.</p> <p>Suriname\u2019s long-term economic prospects could be brighter, however.</p> <p>In January international oil firms announced they had discovered offshore oil, leading to speculation that the reserves recently developed in Guyana could extend into Surinamese waters. If Bouterse can cling on to power, his next term could see billions of dollars of foreign investment.</p> <p>Until recently, however, that seemed unlikely. \u201cThe loss of purchasing power as a result of the weak currency has cost Bouterse a lot of middle-class support, particularly in the capital where opposition parties have grown rapidly\u201d said Hans Breeveld, a political analyst at Anton de Kom University in Paramaribo.</p> <p>But the Covid-19 pandemic has stalled the opposition\u2019s momentum. To date the country has had 11 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and one death, but a curfew and social distancing measures have been in place since 8 April, cutting off the sparsely populated forested inland regions from the coast.</p> <p>That has made it impossible for opposition groups to organize rallies<br>or reach inland areas. The pandemic has prompted to the EU to cancel its election observation mission, although the Organization of American States (OAS) will send a 10-person team.</p> <p>\u201cIn the interior you need just 700 votes for some seats, compared to 7,000 in the capital. There\u2019s been no oversight of what\u2019s happening in the interior and Bouterse\u2019s party has a history of using national funds for his campaigns,\u201d said Breeveld. </p> <p>Santokhi warned that a failure to oust Bouterse would have wider ramifications for the region.</p> <p>\u201cSurinamers have a choice between a better future or to become the next Venezuela\u201d he says. \u201cShould Bouterse retain power, the Caribbean region can expect to see economic refugees and cross border crime.\u201d</p>",

While the experience has been life-changing for her, the Covid-19 crisis has thrown up new challenges for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/27/domestic-abuse-surge-coronavirus-lockdown-lasting-impact-mps\">those living in protected accommodation</a>, as well as the staff who are risking the virus to keep the services running.</p> <p>Through interviews and diary extracts, Annie and two women in the Reigate and Banstead Women\u2019s Aid refuge in Surrey have provided the Guardian with unique insight into life there in the time of Covid-19.</p> <p>\u201cI was concerned about coming to the refuge \u2013 anyone would be \u2013 but if you know that you\u2019re going to be able to get far, far away then it\u2019s worth it,\u201d Annie said. \u201cSo you just have to go through all your fears and break them down a little bit.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/13/my-working-week-mother-arrives-refuge-covid-19-symptoms\">My working week: 'A mother arrives at our refuge with Covid-19 symptoms'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rebecca, who is pregnant and has children, found the first few weeks of lockdown hard.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to come to terms with the news of a lockdown, the virus, being pregnant, and in a refuge with other families that I have no control over how they should keep up with hygiene,\u201d she wrote in her diary.</p> <p>\u201cSo many fears and questions linger in my mind. How will we share the toilets? We are told that [if] one of us gets sick they will use the toilet and the shower downstairs and that is where my room is.\u201d</p> <p>Rebecca explains she and the other tenants agree to a cleaning rota to allow some social distancing. \u201cSharing the communal areas is becoming a sort of nightmare because you don\u2019t know if the people here have the virus or not,\u201d she wrote.</p> <p>\u201cI keep to my room as I consider myself a high risk. I am very anxious and worried when my kids go out to the back garden and interact with other children.\u201d</p> <p>Rebecca is a migrant and has to apply for a destitution domestic violence concession, allowing her to claim public funds while applying to settle in the UK. She found the challenges of home-schooling in a new environment difficult.</p> <p>\u201cI now have to be a teacher to my kids and make sure they complete school work,\u201d she wrote.</p> <p>\u201cThey are feeling disappointed but at least the whole country is on lockdown, not just us. So it doesn\u2019t make us feel disadvantaged. I try as much as I can to assure them.\u201d</p> <p>Other children knock on the door in the refuge, which makes her anxious. She wants her children to feel at home but she is concerned about the virus. \u201cI live in fear of the unknown,\u201d she wrote.</p> <p>The women may feel anxious about the virus in the refuge but the staff are working hard to ensure they are in a safe environment.</p> <p>Charlotte Kneer, the chief executive of the Reigate and Banstead Women\u2019s Aid refuge and a survivor of abuse, said: \u201cThe big worry is it\u2019s a communal living environment in the same way as nurseries; if one gets a bug it goes through the whole place. It\u2019s the same for us.</p> <p>\u201cWe have 11 women, 24 children, in a small space where they\u2019re sharing facilities. We\u2019re trying to make sure that every day there\u2019s enough cleaning stuff.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m worried that if someone gets it, they\u2019re all going to get it.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a plan that if someone has it or suspects they have it, there\u2019s a bathroom only they and their children use. Only come out and use the kitchen when no one else is around.\u201d</p> <p>Kneer\u2019s refuge can house up to 11 vulnerable women and 24 children at a time. It offers clean, furnished rooms with televisions and tea-making facilities, a communal living area and kitchen, and a large garden with playground equipment.</p> <p>One member of staff is on site every day to hand out rations of food and toiletries.</p> <p>Multiple support services have seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/28/lockdowns-world-rise-domestic-violence\">a surge in calls to helplines</a> during the lockdown period but there are fears that the already creaking refuge system in England and Wales will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/28/refuges-from-domestic-violence-running-out-of-space-mps-hear\">not be able to cope with the number of women looking to flee abuse</a>.</p> <p>Sally, also a mother, said the lockdown had brought with it additional anxiety and frustration.</p> <p>\u201cBut I would like to add, that no matter the delay and any problems we get, this is the best place to be under the circumstances of domestic abuse. First of all me and my child, we are safe. We receive a lot of emotional and practical support here.</p> <p>\u201cIt was very helpful to understand how serious the abuse was that I went through, and how important it is to always keep my address secret and leave no chance for my perpetrator to contact me.</p> <p>\u201cThe assurance that we did the right thing removing ourselves from abuse and understanding that it wasn\u2019t all just my sensitive feelings or overreaction went a long way in feeling more confident. Being manipulated for 10 years makes you doubt yourself in every thought you have and every step you make.\u201d</p> <p>She had to take a Covid-19 test while staying in the refuge after a visit to hospital for a stomach sickness and high temperature.</p> <p>While at the hospital, one of her children spent the night with one of the refuge workers \u2013 but social services recommended this was limited to the one night.</p> <p>\u201cIt was difficult, he didn\u2019t want me to go without him and he was crying on my way out,\u201d she wrote.</p> <p>\u201cI was very worried about the Covid-19 test \u2013 if it would be positive, maybe my child had it too, then the possibility to pass it on to the woman who was looking after him, also my housemate who has asthma and her kids.\u201d</p> <p>She was ultimately discharged and the test returned negative \u2013 but because she had visited a hospital she had to self-isolate for two weeks from the rest of the refuge, although her housemate offered to help.</p> <p>\u201cI was having difficult time accepting help. My ex-partner, that I spent 10 years with, he used to call me worthless and useless and ungrateful all the time,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cSlowly he destroyed my self-esteem and my personality, I was just there to cook food and clean and take care of his needs.</p> <p>\u201cThis left a very big impact for me to ask and accept help from anyone. Now not being able to do my usual daily things was making me feel anxious and stressed a lot.\u201d</p> <p>She says that self-isolation compounds how isolated she feels having left her previous home.</p> <p>\u201cRefuge helped me a lot,\u201d she wrote, \u201cit was a life-saving decision to move here, but there always comes the feeling of isolation.</p> <p>\u201cHaving to go through lockdown and now self-isolation made it even worse, especially when you are sharing your home with another family, you don\u2019t really feel free at your own home, you don\u2019t even feel that you are at home.\u201d</p> <p>The shortage in spaces in refuges during lockdown has sparked initiatives to offer safe accommodation with specialist support, such as the Covid-19 Crisis Project run by Solace and Southall Black Sisters in London.</p> <p>There were 72 refuge vacancies in England on 3 April, compared with 170 on the same day last year.

  "<p>When The Empire Strikes Back was released 40 years ago, it was simply the sequel to Star Wars. It was not yet Star Wars: Episode V \u2013 The Empire Strikes Back, the middle chapter of a nine-film \u201csaga\u201d told in three trilogies. It was not yet subject to the obsessive tweaking that George Lucas started to do with the special editions two decades later, with their digital polishing, retconned bits of storytelling, and added characters and dialogue. And it was not yet freighted by spinoff projects, a splintered fan culture, and a mythology that\u2019s complicated by the incompatible, sometimes contradictory visions of multiple film-makers and a corporate parent fussing over its investment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/04/may-the-fourth-be-with-you-the-guardian-star-wars-day-quiz\">May the fourth be with you: the Guardian Star Wars Day quiz</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Watching The Empire Strikes Back in 2020 isn\u2019t exactly the same as watching it in 1980: the special edition, though not as aggressive as the other two in the first trilogy, has officially supplanted the original film and has a much glossier texture than other films at the time. Yet it nonetheless feels so simple and pure and liberating, not least because the future of the whole unwieldy franchise can be forgotten for 127 minutes and the past is only the 1977 Star Wars, which here serves as the first act that does all the heavy lifting for a second that only has to step on the gas.</p> <p>The first Star Wars was made as if there would never be another \u2013 and based on reactions to Lucas\u2019s rough cut, success was far from assured \u2013 but The Empire Strikes Back was made with the next film in mind, which presented a storytelling challenge that was not common at the time. It\u2019s a narrative with no beginning and no end, starting with the assumption that the audience that will know the characters and the events that preceded it and then further assuming the audience will comfortable without a conclusion. Lucas himself had a good handle on serialization \u2013 Raiders of the Lost Ark, which he would produce a year later, was inspired by old adventure serials \u2013 but many critics at the time were flummoxed, like the New York Times\u2019s Vincent Canby, who <a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/film/061580empire.html\">likened</a> the film to \u201creading the middle of a comic book\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6b6ef3e7a0a6a4fdd9a0c6f62419336bcb5a5668\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b6ef3e7a0a6a4fdd9a0c6f62419336bcb5a5668/0_0_1400_932/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Behind the scenes of The Empire Strikes Back\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Behind the scenes of The Empire Strikes Back.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/LUCASFILM/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now that such serialization has become common, it\u2019s easier to appreciate how Lucas and his collaborators \u2013 director Irvin Kershner, and screenwriters Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan \u2013 seized on the advantages of opening <em>in medias res</em> and closing on a cliffhanger. (And not just any cliffhanger, but an actual <em>setback</em>, with key players of the Rebel Alliance separated and Luke Skywalker having lost a duel with Darth Vader.) All the throat-clearing necessary is a scroll informing us that Imperial troops are chasing rebel forces across the galaxy, and that Luke (Mark Hamill) and the freedom fighters are hiding out in the inhospitable ice world of Hoth. From there, The Empire Strikes Back can immediately barrel into a series of thrilling images and set pieces: Luke and his tauntaun attacked by a wampa, a creature that looks like a Rankin-Bass abominable snowman; Han Solo (Harrison Ford) strikes out after dusk to track Luke down, facing temperatures so deadly that C3PO estimates a 725-1 chance of survival; and a probe finally locates the rebels on Hoth, leading to a siege by Imperial walkers, war machines that can\u2019t be penetrated by laser fire, but are vulnerable to harpoons and tow wire.</p> <p>The blockbuster was still in its infancy when The Empire Strikes Back was produced. Though Jaws is credited with the dawn of the blockbuster age, it wasn\u2019t as if studios immediately started filling up the summer with big-budget entertainments every week. The original Star Wars followed through on the commercial promise of Jaws, but it was this sequel that set the standard for the decade where the model changed forever. To watch that breathless sequence of events on Hoth now is to see a combination of efficiency and spectacle that blockbusters have been chasing ever since \u2013 rarely with the same success, even in the seven films that would follow it in the Star Wars saga.</p> <p>Conceiving the film as a relentless chase across the galaxy also gives Lucas and company the chance to immerse itself in world-building before it became a crippling obsession in the prequels. From the sub-arctic extremes of Hoth, which recall the Siberian wasteland of Akira Kurosawa\u2019s Dersu Uzala, The Empire Strikes Back stages action in beautifully conceived new environments: The fetid swamplands of Dagobah, where the centuries-old Jedi master Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz) takes cover; the art deco sheen of Cloud City on the planet Bespin, which seems to reflect the slick, beautiful, opportunistic soul of Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams); and the grim catacombs of a giant asteroid, where Han, Leia (Carrie Fisher), and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) hide out after the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon sputters out like an old Buick.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNwNXF9Y6kY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JNwNXF9Y6kY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>All these clean, distinct, meticulously realized settings and set pieces exist in support of the series\u2019 most powerful revelation: that Darth Vader, the fearsome antagonist of the series, is actually Anakin Skywalker, Luke\u2019s father, a Jedi who was seduced by the dark side of the Force. Now Luke, the sandy-haired naif of Star Wars, who we\u2019d understood as an uncomplicated and gung-ho hero, has to contend with a much more uncertain destiny. Lucas would need the entire prequel trilogy to explain how Anakin\u2019s sand-hating petulance would lead him to Emperor Palpatine\u2019s side, but The Empire Strikes Back suggests that possibility for Luke with the same dramatic swiftness and power of the rest of the film. Luke\u2019s failure to accept Yoda\u2019s pleas for patience and discipline at Dagobah feeds directly into his confrontation with his father, who intends to reward his worst instincts. It didn\u2019t take an entire prequel trilogy to realize that father and son have a few things in common.</p> <p>After The Empire Strikes Back, the Star Wars saga would surrender to the ungainly and sentimental Return of the Jedi, and never quite find its way back to a film that\u2019s as simultaneously streamlined and complex. The operatic qualities of The Last Jedi come closest, but by then, the series had taken on so much weight from its patched-together mythology and accumulation of old and new characters that it couldn\u2019t move at the same speed. It\u2019s an all-killer/no-filler Star Wars movie, a steady escalation of action that\u2019s already in progress from the moment it starts. The series would never \u2013 and <em>can never</em> \u2013 be this good again.</p>",
  "<h2>Top story: Minister reproached over \u2018wrong\u2019 science slur</h2> \n<p>Good morning \u2013 it\u2019s Thursday and I\u2019m Warren Murray, here to help you track and trace the big stories.</p> \n<p>A top US scientist has said governments should not count on a Covid-19 vaccine being developed anytime soon, as global infections were set to pass five million after surges in Latin American countries including Brazil. The cancer, HIV/Aids and human genome projects researcher William Haseltine has said the best approach to the pandemic is to manage the disease through careful tracing of infections and strict isolation measures whenever it starts spreading. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/global-report-coronavirus-vaccine-us-scientist-cases-5-million\">While a vaccine could be developed, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t count on it\u201d</a>, and people should wear masks, wash hands, clean surfaces and keep a distance. He said the United States and other countries had not done enough to \u201cforcibly isolate\u201d people exposed to the virus, but praised China, South Korea and Taiwan\u2019s efforts to curb infections.</p> \n<p>Surgical or everyday face masks can produce \u201cleakage jets\u201d that have the potential to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/21/face-mask-rules-more-political-than-scientific-says-expert\">propel virus particles several metres when the wearers exhale</a>, researchers at the University of Edinburgh have found. All face masks without a valve, including cloth masks, reduced the distance exhaled air travelled in a forward direction by more than 90% but unless tightly worn they could send jets downwards and backwards. At present the UK government recommends the public wear face coverings in crowded places where social distancing is not feasible.</p> \n<p>Scientists must be allowed to take independent decisions without fear of recriminations, the head of the Royal Society has warned after a cabinet minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/uk-scientists-must-not-be-blamed-coronavirus-advice-says-royal-society-head\">appeared to blame \u201cwrong\u201d science</a> for mistakes in tackling the coronavirus pandemic. The government has disowned the remarks by Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, the work and pensions secretary.</p> \n<p>Ministers responding to the pandemic have on 11 occasions ordered departments to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/21/ministers-overruled-permanent-secretaries-11-times-pandemic\">override formal objections from their most senior civil servant</a>, the permanent secretary, the National Audit Office (NAO) reports. Permanent secretaries challenged extraordinary spending pledges because they were made quickly and without full \u201cvalue for money\u201d checks, the NAO said. Because of the urgency, secretaries of state forced the spending pledges through and made themselves solely accountable. There are thought to have been only 75 such directions in the past 30 years.</p> \n<p>Stay alert to our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/21/coronavirus-live-news-global-cases-near-5m-as-eu-health-chief-warns-of-second-wave\">global live blog</a> as your day proceeds \u2013 here is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/coronavirus-latest-21-may-at-a-glance\">quick flick through overnight developments</a>.</p> \n<p><em>There\u2019s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down \u2026 and here\u2019s where you can find <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">all our coverage of the outbreak \u2013 from breaking news to factchecks and advice</a>.</em></p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018Chronic threat\u2019 \u2013 </strong>Preparing for a no-deal Brexit later this year would overwhelm emergency response teams already burnt out from dealing with Covid-19, a leaked Whitehall report warns.

It is a growing and much bigger slice of the national income than previously thought. In 2017-18 there were \u00a355bn of taxable capital gains recorded, with \u00a334bn of that divided between 9,000 individuals. The report questions whether capital gains should still be taxed at a much lower rate than other income, given they mainly flow to the rich, while the government faces a pressing need for raise revenue.

The finance ministry says imports fell 7%. The drop in exports is the worst since the 2008 financial crisis, as Japan struggles through a technical recession, juggling the health risks of Covid-19 with the need to keep the economy going.

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2><strong>Global cases near 5 million</strong></h2> <p>After the biggest single-day increase in cases worldwide so far in the pandemic, the number of confirmed infections is close to 5 million, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The true number is likely to be significantly higher, due to differing testing rates, delays and underreporting. This is true for deaths, too. At least 328,120 people have lost their lives in the pandemic so far.</p> <h2>\u2018Don\u2019t count on\u2019 vaccine\u2019</h2> <p>A top US scientist has said governments <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/global-report-coronavirus-vaccine-us-scientist-cases-5-million\">should not count on a Covid-19 vaccine</a> being developed any time soon, urging people to wear masks, wash hands, clean surfaces and keep a distance. William Haseltine, the groundbreaking cancer, HIV/AIDS and human genome projects researcher, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a slam-dunk case by any means ... because every time people have tried to make a vaccine \u2013 for Sars or Mers \u2013 it hasn\u2019t actually protected.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Migrant boat crossings to UK surge during virus lockdown</strong></h2> <p>The number of unaccompanied young migrants crossing the Channel from France to Britain has spiked during the coronavirus outbreak, as travel restrictions force them onto boats rather than trucks. Kent County Council in southeast England, which includes the major port of Dover, was dealing with \u201c230 to 250\u201d young migrants a year ago, its chief executive, Roger Gough, said.</p> <h2><strong>Mexico suffers record one-day death toll</strong></h2> <p>Mexico\u2019s health ministry on Wednesday registered 2,248 new coronavirus infections and an additional 424 fatalities, a record one-day death toll since the start of the pandemic. The new infections brought confirmed coronavirus cases to 56,594 and 6,090 deaths in total, according to the official tally. Mexico registered its biggest daily increase yet in infections on Tuesday, when it reported 2,713 new cases. Mexico\u2019s highest daily death toll was on 12 May, when health authorities reported 353 fatalities.</p> <h2><strong>World sees largest daily rise in cases</strong></h2> <p>The World Health Organization gave a stark warning on Wednesday that the coronavirus pandemic is far from over, after 106,000 new cases were recorded worldwide over the past 24 hours \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/global-report-coronavirus-pandemic-not-over-warns-the-who\">the most in a single day so far</a>. Speaking in Geneva, the WHO\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the virus was spreading in poorer countries, just as wealthier nations were emerging from lockdown.</p> <h2><strong>Europe should brace for second wave, says</strong> EU coronavirus chief</h2> <p>The prospect of a second wave of coronavirus infection across <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news\">Europe</a> is no longer a distant theory, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments \u2013 including the UK \u2013 on disease control. \u201cThe question is when and how big. That is the question in my view,\u201d said Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.</p> <h2><strong>Japan to lift state of emergency in Osaka and two other prefectures</strong></h2> <p>Japan\u2019s economy minister says experts have approved a government plan to remove a coronavirus state of emergency in Osaka and two neighbouring prefectures in the west where the infection is deemed slowing, while keeping the measure in place in the Tokyo region and Hokkaido. Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura told reporters that experts at the meeting approved the plan to lift the measure in Osaka, Kyoto and Hyogo. The measure will be kept in place in Tokyo and three neighboring prefectures, as well as Hokkaido, where the infections have slowed but need further improvement.</p> <h2><strong>Trump considers an in-person G7 meeting despite coronavirus pandemic</strong></h2> <p>Donald Trump has said he may seek to revive a face-to-face meeting of Group of Seven leaders near Washington, after earlier canceling the gathering due to the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cI am considering rescheduling the G-7, on the same or similar date, in Washington, DC, at the legendary Camp David,\u201d the US president tweeted on Wednesday. \u201cThe other members are also beginning their COMEBACK. It would be a great sign to all \u2013 normalization!\u201d</p> <h2><strong>More than 100 virus infections in French slaughterhouse</strong></h2> <p>More than 100 people have tested positive for the novel coronavirus at a slaughterhouse in western France, the regional health authorities said Wednesday. The cases follow coronavirus outbreaks at meat plants not only in France but also in Germany, Spain, Australia, the United States and Brazil - where people tend to work in close proximity. A total of 109 personnel have tested positive at the slaughterhouse in Cotes d\u2019Armor following a second wave of testing, the ARS regional health authority said in a statement. Some 818 people have been tested at the plant, it added.</p>",
  "<p>One day in the summer of 2017, I was sitting at a cafe table in the atrium of Portcullis House, across the road from the Palace of Westminster. With indoor trees and a good coffee bar, it\u2019s a pleasant place for politicians and their staff to meet, outside their cramped offices. I was there to interview an MP for a research project, hoping to learn more about how MPs understood climate change, and how that shaped their work in parliament.</p> <p>The MP arrived. She was young and, at least on the surface, full of confidence. I explained that my interviews would be anonymised, so that she and others could talk freely about how they came to their public positions on climate. She told me she regularly speaks for her party on climate change, telling people about the need for action to tackle emissions. And yet, she said, there was a catch: lots of people in the constituency she represents have jobs in an industry responsible for huge amounts of carbon pollution.</p> <p>She had two, conflicting, demands: she wanted urgent action on climate; and she also wanted government support to allow her local industry to continue polluting. She was simultaneously backing and opposing climate action. She was worried that someone \u2013 maybe a constituent or the local paper \u2013 would point out this glaring contradiction. But so far, no one had. \u201cI thought I might get a bit of pushback,\u201d she told me. \u201cI\u2019ve had absolutely zero.\u201d</p> <p>This contradiction sums up the state of climate politics in the UK today. There is strong cross-party support for far-reaching carbon targets. In June last year, the government passed a law to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/11/theresa-may-commits-to-net-zero-uk-carbon-emissions-by-2050\" title=\"\">strengthen these targets</a>, committing the UK to end virtually all emissions of carbon and other greenhouse gases within the next 30 years. There was next to no opposition \u2013 in fact, Labour and the Liberal Democrats argued for an earlier phase-out date. And yet politicians are oddly reluctant to talk about how we might actually meet these targets. There is very little honest debate about the major changes to our economy and society that will be needed if we are to meet this challenge. Like my interviewee, we\u2019re all in favour of climate action, but we haven\u2019t yet had an honest conversation about the power and the vested interests involved, or the choices that will have to be made if we are to achieve significant reductions in emissions.</p> <p>I have come to think of this as the dual reality of climate politics. We know that things need to change, and yet we\u2019re embedded in our current lives and our current politics. We exist in both realities at once. Politicians make grand statements about the threat of climate change, then flip straight back into politics-as-usual. They find it hard to imagine, and to get others to imagine, how we might talk about and bring into being a politics with climate at its heart. It\u2019s easier to look away.</p> <p>In recent months, though, politics has changed almost beyond recognition. The coronavirus pandemic is a global crisis that alters fundamentally the way we see risks, politics, and the relationship between people and society. Like everyone else, I am not sure what the world will look like on the other side. The only certainty is that everything <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/how-will-the-world-emerge-from-the-coronavirus-crisis\" title=\"\">will be different</a>. If, as I\u2019ve described, politicians have until now been finding it hard to contemplate radical changes to the status quo, has this barrier now fallen away?</p> <p>Covid-19 is, understandably, taking up all the political and media attention there is, for now. But the need for fast, radical carbon cuts \u2013 and a political strategy that will allow this to happen \u2013 has not gone away. Will green investment be prioritised in the economic stimulus packages that are undoubtedly needed? Will people think differently about travel or food security? Will we emerge with a politics that focuses more on a collective approach to global challenges such as climate? Or will we fall back into desperate attempts to rekindle the old economy and the old ways? For now, there are only questions. But my research offers some clues about how the recovery could be climate-proofed.</p> <h2>* * *<br></h2> <p>I\u2019ve worked with politicians for many years. In the early days of Tony Blair\u2019s administration, I got a job with the thinktank Green Alliance. I started to look into the backgrounds of new Labour MPs, trying to find ways of connecting with them on environmental issues. We worked with the Conservatives in opposition, too, so that they could hold the government to account. Gradually, climate issues grabbed a political foothold. In 2006, the Tories went into a local election campaign with the slogan \u201cvote blue, go green\u201d, and the parties began to compete for environmentally minded voters. Then in 2009, came the Climate Change Act, a comprehensive piece of legislation setting legally binding carbon targets into UK law.</p> <p>Even then, the dual reality was evident. Despite the obvious implications for economy and society, there was precious little media coverage or political debate about these new laws. I asked a senior Labour figure what discussions there had been about the act as it went through parliament. \u201cI don\u2019t remember it being one of the big issues,\u201d she told me. All the talk had been of counter-terrorism and banning smoking in public places. For climate, in contrast, \u201cI remember it going on in the background, but it wasn\u2019t something that had high temperature\u201d. Politicians quietly passed a radical act of parliament committing the UK to serious change \u2013 and then carried on as normal.</p> <p>That same year the act was passed, I had an idea that came to dominate my working life for a decade. Frustrated by the mismatch between the scale of the climate challenge and the response from politicians, I wanted to make sure that the next generation of MPs were equipped with all the evidence and skills they needed to make informed decisions on climate. New MPs are lobbied from all sides, but they are offered very little training or support for their new and often daunting roles. Climate science, and climate policy, is complex. How could we expect them to lead us if they didn\u2019t understand what it was all about?</p> <p>With the backing of Green Alliance and some philanthropic funders, I set up a training programme. We offered parliamentary candidates and new MPs the chance to learn about the science, policy and politics of climate in a series of tailor-made workshops. We worked with small groups of around 10 politicians, all from the same party, to allow them to question and debate freely. We asked leading climate scientists to join us to answer the MPs\u2019 questions. Businesspeople came to talk through how they were thinking about the likely impact of climate change on their companies, and climate activists explained why they campaigned on the issue. At the end of each workshop, the new MPs got together with more senior politicians \u2013 ministers or frontbenchers \u2013 to debate what climate change meant for the outlook, values and strategy of their party.</p> <p>Running these workshops was a fascinating experience. In each, there was a definite point which I came to think of as a \u201cpenny-drop moment\u201d, when the participants came to realise the significance of the climate crisis and the way it would shape our collective future. In one workshop, for example, a very eminent scientist explained to MPs how crop yields are likely to be severely affected by extreme weather, a likely scenario if global average temperatures rise by 2C or more \u2013 and that this could lead to food shortages. The response was striking. There was a silence, a collective intake of breath, a recognition of the significance of the changes that could be upon us if we don\u2019t act.</p> <p>And then, at the end of our workshop, they walked out of the door and back to their normal lives.</p> <p>We kept talking to them. We organised more briefings, and we worked with them in their constituencies to bring climate issues home. In Sheffield, we talked about how communities could set up and own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/12/community-generated-green-electricity-to-be-offered-to-all-in-uk\" title=\"\">renewable energy projects</a>. In Nottingham, we talked about resilience to floods. They were polite conversations, but all the time, that sense of dual reality was with me. If they understood the seriousness of climate change, I thought constantly, why aren\u2019t they doing more?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"afcb85fa426712679510187631f7a82fbdd47560\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afcb85fa426712679510187631f7a82fbdd47560/0_0_4597_3065/1000.jpg\" alt=\"MPs from various parties meeting climate activist Greta Thunberg at the Houses of Parliament in April last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">MPs from various parties meeting climate activist Greta Thunberg at the Houses of Parliament in April last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I became a little bit obsessed with this question. I wanted to see whether they worried about climate, or whether they had somehow convinced themselves that it would all be OK. I decided I would ask them directly. And so, in 2015, with Lancaster University, I set up my research project in order to learn more about how MPs understood climate change, and its implications for political life. I chose to work with a small number of MPs \u2013 23 in all \u2013 to get a detailed, qualitative understanding of their views. I spoke to politicians from all parties and all levels of seniority. The only group I left alone were the small, but nonetheless influential, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/11/tory-mps-five-times-more-likely-to-vote-against-climate-action\" title=\"\">number of known \u201cclimate sceptic\u201d MPs</a>, who publicly state that they do not accept the scientific consensus on climate change.</p> <p>I offered my interviewees anonymity. Many displayed a disarming frankness about their professional and personal struggles, often at odds with their appearance of breezy confidence.</p> <p>All the politicians I spoke to accepted the science of climate change. And yet they downplayed the consequences. They showed a reluctance to discuss how climate change would reshape human society. A newly elected MP, talking to me in the House of Commons, told me that climate \u201cterrified\u201d him. \u201cWhere we\u2019re sat right now might well be underwater, right next to the Thames. I wouldn\u2019t fancy our chances.\u201d</p> <p>I asked why, if it\u2019s so significant, it wasn\u2019t discussed much in parliament. But he didn\u2019t answer. He couldn\u2019t, or didn\u2019t want to, linger on this point: he steered the discussion on to electoral cycles, the health service, the economy. He was back in the manageable normality he knew, rejecting the reality of a climate-changed future that had, just a few moments before, terrified him.</p> <p>Over the course of the interviews, carried out between 2016 and 2018, I saw a pattern emerge. The way politicians responded to climate didn\u2019t just depend on what they thought about the science. Instead, it became clear to me that there were two main reasons why MPs struggled with the issue: first, because it didn\u2019t fit easily into the culture of political life and their own identity as a parliamentarian; and second, because they worried that public support for climate action was limited, and that, as representatives, they needed to be led by their electorate.</p> <h2>* * *<br></h2> <p>It\u2019s obvious that the House of Commons is an institution with a strong internal culture. Yet I was surprised by the extent to which the MPs I spoke to felt constrained by the social norms of their workplace. In one conversation, my interviewee was deliciously unguarded in her opinions of her colleagues. She said that just a few of her 600 or so fellow parliamentarians took climate seriously as an issue: \u201cYou might not get into double figures.\u201d She told me she saw everything through a climate lens, and was, in private, very critical of measures such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/25/british-taxpayers-bill-tax-relief-oil-gas-companies\" title=\"\">tax breaks for oil and gas exploration</a>. And yet she felt that she had to tread carefully: she has to fit in. I asked her what would happen if she tried to intervene in a budget debate, to make the case that fossil fuels should stay in the ground. She replied: \u201cI think they\u2019d just think you were a bit \u2018niche\u2019, is the way I\u2019d put it \u2013 I say \u2018niche\u2019 in quotes, like a bit of a lunatic fringe.\u201d</p> <p>One former MP, who had been an active climate campaigner in parliament, said: \u201cI was known as being a freak.\u201d Another told me about how he tried to avoid being seen as a \u201czealot\u201d. These remarks were common in my conversations with politicians. Some said they avoided any mention of climate for fear that it would put an unhelpful label on them. One confident, outspoken MP who worked on energy policy told me that he did what he could to promote policies that would reduce carbon, but justified his proposals on other grounds, such as reducing fuel bills. \u201cI don\u2019t use climate change as the word because I think it\u2019s just toxic,\u201d he told me. \u201cAs is the way in these issues which are contentious, you won\u2019t take people with you politically.\u201d</p> <p>This shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. We know the way people think and act is conditioned by their social world. This plays far more of a role in our responses to climate change than we might imagine \u2013 and politicians are no exception.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a4fd2319fcf5ac28d3ff3dd9d56b9b7dc53173b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4fd2319fcf5ac28d3ff3dd9d56b9b7dc53173b9/0_75_3754_4688/801.jpg\" alt=\"Sir David Attenborough addresses the Climate Assembly UK in January this year.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir David Attenborough addresses the Climate Assembly UK in January this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Stonehouse/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Back in 2001, the anthropologist Kari Norgaard spent a year living in a rural Norwegian village. That winter, the weather was unusually warm. The lake didn\u2019t freeze over, and the local ski resort had not received any snow by mid-December, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/19/snow-machines-fleece-blankets-inside-ski-industry-battle-with-climate-change-alpine-resorts\" title=\"\">having to resort to artificial snow</a> \u2013 something that had not happened before. Income from the ski industry was reduced, and the tradition of ice fishing was interrupted. When talking about this and other weather patterns, villagers mentioned climate change, and seemed to have a good level of understanding. And yet climate was not something that people factored into their daily lives.</p> <p>Norgaard uncovered a paradox: people were aware of, and concerned by, climate change, but chose to ignore it. It was an unspoken collective turning away. She asked: \u201cHow could the possibility of climate change be deeply disturbing and almost completely invisible \u2013 simultaneously unimaginable and common knowledge?\u201d She labelled this phenomenon \u201csocially organised denial\u201d. Norgaard pointed to a range of strategies people used that allowed them to continue as if climate change wasn\u2019t happening. Some said that Norway was a relatively small country, with insignificant emissions compared to the US. There was also a widespread sense that, as a rural community, they lived simply and \u201cwith nature\u201d. By telling each other these and other stories, they created the fiction that all could continue unchanged.</p> <p>Socially organised denial is alive and well in the Commons. It is exacerbated by very deliberate strategies from those who have a stake in high-carbon activities: countries, and companies, that depend on fossil fuels.</p> <p>As a result, it is surprisingly difficult for politicians to talk openly about the need to transition away from fossil fuels. Witness Nicola Sturgeon, leader of a progressive Scottish government that champions strong climate commitments, while also supporting continued oil and gas extraction in the North Sea. When challenged, her reply is always the same: the industry \u201ccannot be shut down overnight\u201d. She\u2019s right. But her dismissive response shies away from the science, which tells us very clearly that fossil fuels need to stay in the ground, and that we need a plan to move away from them, and create opportunities and jobs elsewhere \u2013 not overnight, but urgently.</p> <p>The toxic combination of socially organised denial and deliberate lobbying has created a problem that I\u2019ve come to think of as the \u201cfeelgood fallacy\u201d. So far, climate action has focused overwhelmingly on low-carbon solutions such as developing renewable energy or offering grants for electric vehicles. These are very valuable schemes, but all this positive activity masks a deeper problem. Little has been done to curb carbon-intensive activity. New coal mines are opened and new airports built with little discussion of climate impacts. If we are constantly finding new ways to dig up and burn carbon, it won\u2019t be enough just to ramp up renewable energy. Study after study shows that meeting climate goals means phasing out the extraction and use of oil, coal and gas \u2013 yet no mainstream political party has a coherent plan to do this.</p> <p>If pressed, politicians like Sturgeon could hide behind a quirk in the rules of carbon accounting. According to conventions set by the United Nations, we count the carbon where it\u2019s burned, not where it\u2019s taken out of the ground. This creates a strange incentive to dig more up, ship it out and let other countries take the hit on their carbon target. But what might make accounting sense for one country works directly against the global goal of reducing emissions.</p> <h2>* * *<br></h2> <p>Politicians, then, are constrained by the culture of political life. They also feel constrained by the electorate. There was a striking consistency in my interviews: no MP felt that their voters were putting them under particular pressure to act. As one said to me, \u201cI\u2019ve knocked hundreds, literally thousands of doors, and had tens of thousands of conversations with voters \u2026 and I just don\u2019t have conversations about climate change.\u201d</p> <p>Many of these conversations took place before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/school-climate-strikes\" title=\"\">school climate strikes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/extinction-rebellion\" title=\"\">Extinction Rebellion</a> protests began in 2018 \u2013 these were remarkable events, after which the polls showed heightened levels of concern. Yet speaking to politicians during and after the 2019 election, I heard a lot of uncertainty about how this generalised concern might translate into support for particular climate strategies. And this matters, particularly in the UK\u2019s constituency-based system, where MPs feel a particularly strong attachment to the local patch, described by one as \u201calmost like being a parent. It\u2019s got the sort of joys and terror associated with that type of emotional connection.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2110a813d81f6d8e75d87510732c26beff873300\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2110a813d81f6d8e75d87510732c26beff873300/210_0_1790_1127/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An Extinction Rebellion climate protest in the House of Commons public gallery in April 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"630\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Extinction Rebellion climate protest in the House of Commons public gallery in April 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Extinction Rebellion/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Exactly how a politician \u201crepresents\u201d the people is not at all straightforward. When an MP campaigns against a hospital closure, they are, in effect, saying\u201d: \u201cI am campaigning for local health services and this makes me a worthy representative of this area.\u201d This is a relatively straightforward claim. With climate \u2013 a complex, global issue with no clear beginning or end \u2013 it\u2019s more complicated. Politicians have to work quite hard to make a claim for why acting on climate is in the best interests of their electorate.</p> <p>They might do this through pointing out that a global problem such as climate change requires everyone to do their bit. But this claim is often ignored, because people are understandably caught up with their daily lives and struggles, or feel powerless, cynical or overwhelmed by the scale of the challenge. Some politicians point out the economic or social benefits of climate action, such as jobs in renewable energy. As one told me: \u201cI\u2019m happy to use an economic argument if that means more people will come on side.\u201d Another told me about proposals for a new road in his constituency, which he opposed. If he had used a climate argument, he said, \u201cthere would have been a rolling of eyes and saying: \u2018Oh, here he goes again.\u2019\u201d Instead, he made the case on economic grounds, saying that investment in public transport was a better option.</p> <p>There\u2019s a danger in dampening down the message in this way. If politicians don\u2019t speak out, people don\u2019t feel a sense of urgency. They are less likely to support climate action if they don\u2019t see their politicians leading the way, or offering up a strategy that is as serious as the problem it is designed to address. Climate politics becomes a silent standoff, with neither citizens nor representatives willing to make the first move.</p> <p>But this standoff contains the seeds of a solution. If politicians have the confidence to lead, to see climate action as a social contract between citizens and politicians, this is likely to lead to greater support. What could a confident climate politics look like?</p> <h2>* * *<br></h2> <p>In this new world of the coronavirus pandemic, this question is all the more urgent. Some have cheered the unintentional <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/30/clean-air-in-europe-during-lockdown-leads-to-11000-fewer-deaths\" title=\"\">environmental benefits of lockdown</a>. It\u2019s certainly true that the air is cleaner, the streets quieter. We can hear the birdsong. Carbon emissions have taken a dive, too. But this is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/19/steep-fall-emissions-during-coronavirus-no-cause-for-celebration\" title=\"\">in no way a model</a> for climate strategy. Experience from China has shown that emissions bounce back pretty quickly once lockdown restrictions are eased. But most importantly, lockdown has imposed untold misery and sacrifice. This is emphatically not what is needed for climate action. Instead, politicians need to talk about a purposeful transition: not the juddering halt of lockdown, but the managed transformation of our economy, so wellbeing increases as carbon falls.</p> <p>What the pandemic does provide, though, is the possibility of change. The government has done things in the last few weeks that no one thought possible: paying the wages of millions of private-sector workers; shoring up company finances; involving itself in the lives of individuals in ways that would previously have caused the hackles of even the most radical of politicians to rise. Fundamentally, we are rethinking the relationship between state and citizen. As citizens, we have realised that we need the state to keep us safe from crises, be they immediate, like Covid-19, or longer term, like climate change. Politicians, for their part, have realised that people can rise to the challenge, if they understand what they need to do and why.</p> <p>Once the trauma of lockdown eases, the rebuilding begins. This is perhaps the point at which the risks and opportunities for climate are at their most stark. The government could choose to align its recovery strategy with its climate strategy, or, in the rush to prop up an ailing economy, it could do the opposite \u2013 handing money out in such a way as to safeguard the high-carbon economy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dedac528d1bc759b9c5130ba1ec29d18758dbfac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dedac528d1bc759b9c5130ba1ec29d18758dbfac/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez campaigning for a Green New Deal in Washington DC in November 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez campaigning for a Green New Deal in Washington DC in November 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Reynolds/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If we are to make the right choice here, as a society, the essential first step is a simple one: speaking out. Politicians, and others, need to speak openly and with unflinching honesty about the significance of climate change. As my conversations with MPs have shown, this is a surprisingly difficult thing to do. The left has made a start, with its idea of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/12/the-guardian-view-on-a-green-new-deal-we-need-it-now\" title=\"\">Green New Deal</a>. In the US, politicians led by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ed Markey put forward <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/11/green-new-deal-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-ed-markey\" title=\"\">a plan</a> aiming for net-zero emissions and 100% renewable energy, including job creation in manufacturing, economic justice and even universal healthcare.</p> <p>Following Covid-19, what the Green New Deal now offers is, essentially, a green route to recovery. The plan has many critics, but compared to the low-key approach favoured by UK politicians, it has the advantage of being idealistic, bold and honest. It tells a story about climate action that aims to connect with voters. Elements of this approach could be seen in Labour\u2019s 2019 election offer. On the political right, though, despite support for ambitious targets, there is a distinct lack of a clear story on climate.</p> <p>A second step is to open up a more meaningful dialogue between citizens and politicians. One practical way is through processes like citizens\u2019 assemblies. Early this year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/16/climate-assembly-uk-concludes-in-world-transformed-by-coronavirus\" title=\"\">Climate Assembly UK</a> got underway. This gathering of 110 representative UK citizens, commissioned by six select committees, has heard evidence from experts on climate science and responses, has discussed and deliberated on possible solutions, and will shortly report its findings back to parliament.</p> <p>Third, improving conversations on climate change almost certainly requires more of an appeal to the heart as well as the head. The language of cost-benefit analysis and gross domestic product has its uses, but its appeal is limited, and it accentuates the divide between experts and public, rather than breaking it down. Yet this is the language that politicians have used until now. There are parallels here with the Brexit debate. Remain politicians thought they could win by putting forward a clear-headed case for economic stability, but they left the emotion out of it. In truth, we need both. People care about family, fairness and decency, and an enabling state, looking out for the interests of its citizens. This is exactly how climate action could be framed. Following the coronavirus shutdown, there\u2019s an opportunity to involve people in shaping the way we rebuild our societies and economies, to increase resilience against future threats \u2013 not least, those arising from climate change.</p> <p>Every politician is reassured if they know there is support for their proposals. They can\u2019t govern in a vacuum. We can\u2019t afford to be silent now, when politicians are debating our future. Street protests are out of the question at the moment, but there are many ways to make your voice heard. Talk to MPs and local councillors about your views on climate. Get in touch by phone or email. Ask them what they think; make it a dialogue. From a politician\u2019s point of view, showing your strength of feeling as a citizen, as someone who doesn\u2019t normally kick up a fuss, is immensely powerful.</p> <p>Given a meaningful opportunity to have their say, most people would support action in the face of the climate breakdown that is unfolding in front of us. But our democracies, in their current form, are just not offering people that choice. Politicians and citizens, if they take each other seriously, can turn this around. <br><br>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">weekly email here</a>.</p>",
  "<p>You could spend a lifetime preparing to interview John Malkovich. For starters, there are his films, about 90 of them \u2013 mainstream, indie, European arthouse, schlocky, literary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/29/being-john-malkovich-charlie-kaufman-review\">self-referential</a>, lots of stinkers and a few classics. But he says he doesn\u2019t even like movies. So then there are his more esoteric projects: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/08/malkovich-malkovich-malkovich-catherine-edelman-chicago\">a </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/08/malkovich-malkovich-malkovich-catherine-edelman-chicago\">photography exhibition by Sandro Miller in which Malkovich recreated</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/08/malkovich-malkovich-malkovich-catherine-edelman-chicago\"> iconic portraits</a>, including Dorothea Lange\u2019s Migrant Mother; collaborations with classical musicians in which he reads out venomous critiques of the great composers. Finally, there is his real love \u2013 theatre. Fortunately, Malkovich doesn\u2019t expect you to have seen all his work. In fact, he gives the impression that he would be happy if you had seen none.</p> <p>I first interviewed him 27 years ago when he had just made <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107206/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0\">In </a><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107206/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0\">the Line of Fire</a> \u2013 a thriller in which he plays an assassin determined to kill the president (and which is one of his classics). He didn\u2019t mention the film once in our hour-long meeting. Today, he is supposed to be promoting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/ng-interactive/2018/mar/06/whats-on-netflix-and-amazon-this-month\">Space Force</a>, a Netflix comedy. Again, he doesn\u2019t mention it, until I ask at the end of our call. Instead, he talks about loss. All sorts of loss, from weight (shedding 32kg \u2013 5st \u2013 as a teenager) to hair to money \u2013 and even three siblings in their 50s. But, oddly, the more he talks about loss, in that hushed, melancholy voice, the more I begin to suspect he is one of life\u2019s unlikely optimists.</p> <p>Malkovich is 66, into his fifth decade in the film industry, and insists he has been winging it the whole time. \u201cI certainly never had a plan.\u201d Would it bother him if he never got another job offer? \u201cNo!\u201d He sounds positively enthused. \u201cIt would require a change in the way we live. But we already did that 12 years ago. So that would be fine.\u201d</p> <p>In December 2008, Malkovich lost his life savings. \u201cOur then business manager had invested pretty much everything we\u2019d ever made with somebody called Bernie Madoff.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/12/bernie-madoff-prison-life-ponzi-supernova-podcast-experience\">Madoff defrauded thousands of investors out of an estimated $64.8bn</a> and was given a 150-year jail sentence in 2009. \u201cEverything I\u2019d ever made was gone.\u201d</p> <p>Malkovich had been directing a play in Mexico City and had just returned to New York. \u201cI saw a picture of Bernie Madoff in handcuffs and said to my wife: \u2018I\u2019m going to go to the corner to get a packet of cigarettes. I think we have a little problem with Madoff.\u2019\u201d How did he feel? \u201cYou know, that was a couple of days of shock, I suppose.\u201d He tells the story with such languid insouciance that I initially assume it must be for effect \u2013 but I don\u2019t think it is. This is the real Malkovich.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b12278fb27bbbf8a3ef367278bb02c0c0df5a6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b12278fb27bbbf8a3ef367278bb02c0c0df5a6f/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Malkovich as Dr Adrian Mallory in Space Force\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The final frontier ... Malkovich as Dr Adrian Mallory in Space Force.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron Epstein/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How many millions did he lose? \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. A lot. But I don\u2019t think it mattered that much. We just made changes to the way we lived and the money we spent.\u201d What changed? \u201cI had to do more work that paid for a number of years, and work all the time. And I stopped paying for everything. I just stopped paying for friends and family for a time. And we used to spend a lot of money producing movies that lost quite a lot of money. That stopped.\u201d</p> <p>Was he angry? \u201cNo. Not really. The first couple of days.\u201d Malkovich talks more slowly than anybody I know. Pretty much every word is accompanied by a pause. His language is flat and restrained \u2013 almost self-consciously untheatrical \u2013 even when telling the most dramatic stories. \u201cAfter a couple or three days, you go: \u2018You\u2019re lucky to be alive, you\u2019re lucky to have a job.\u2019 Almost no one has money in the banks. I read somewhere that a huge percentage of Americans wouldn\u2019t have $400 to put between their hands in an emergency.\u201d</p> <p>Malkovich grew up in a fairly privileged, but combustible, family in small-town middle America. His mother owned and edited the local paper in Benton, Illinois, and his father became an environmental journalist and activist. He grew up with three younger sisters and an older brother and has talked about the violence of his childhood \u2013 beatings from his father and his brother, Danny.</p> <p>Today, he says there was nothing remarkable about it. \u201cYou crossed the line and you got a beating. That was very common at that time. Sure, I had a lot of violence growing up, but so what?\u201d Is it true he would chase his brother with a butcher\u2019s knife? There is a long pause, even by Malkovich standards. \u201cMy brother didn\u2019t get anything he didn\u2019t deserve. That\u2019s not saying I didn\u2019t love him \u2013 he\u2019s gone now. He could be hilarious, very smart and extremely witty, but he was quite the torturer.\u201d Another pause. \u201cPeople get sick of being tortured.\u201d</p> <p>At the age of 16, he weighed 102kg (225lb) and was nicknamed Piggy. \u201cKids aren\u2019t very nice,\u201d he says. He went on a jelly-only diet and lost almost a third of his body weight. Yet even when he was mocked by his peers, he had style and self-belief. \u201cI used to play baseball and, when I was young, my father was my coach. He always said to me: if I cared about playing half as much as I cared about how I looked while playing, I could have been a very good baseball player.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14024c9e8b1d8984dbb9a71c578c26117e2968d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14024c9e8b1d8984dbb9a71c578c26117e2968d3/45_0_1165_1165/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Malkovich with Michelle Pfeiffer in 1988\u2019s Dangerous Liaisons.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Life imitates art ... starring in 1988\u2019s Dangerous Liaisons opposite Michelle Pfeiffer, with whom he had an affair.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In fact, Malkovich had wanted to become a professional pitcher. He only started acting because he fancied a girl in the drama group. Even then, his route into acting took detours. He drove a bus, dabbled in biology and sociology at college, then studied theatre at two universities in Illinois \u2013 dropping out of both. He moved to Chicago and became a founding member of the Steppenwolf theatre group, alongside Terry Kinney, Jeff Perry, and Gary Sinise (who directed and starred with Malkovich in Of Mice and Men).</p> <p>In its early years, the theatre\u2019s ensemble also included Glenne Headly, whom he later married, and Joan Allen. The latter said the young Malkovich, who dressed in an array of purples and long scarves, was a cross between Oscar Wilde and Franz Liszt. He was compared to Brando after he burned up the stage in Sam Shepard\u2019s True West in 1980.</p> <p>Four years later, he received an Oscar nomination for his first (non-extra) film part, playing a blind man in <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087921/\">Places In </a><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087921/\">the Heart</a>. <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094947/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0\">Dangerous Liaisons</a> made him a household name in 1988. His on-screen affair with Michelle Pfeiffer was replicated off screen and led to the collapse of his marriage to Headly. He ended up with neither woman and suffered a year-long depression. In 1989, he made <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100594/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0\">The Sheltering Sky</a> and fell in love with the second assistant director, Nicoletta Peyran, with whom he has been since.</p> <p>Slightly boss-eyed, balding by his early 20s, with legs like sequoias and an incipient belly, Malkovich made an unlikely leading man. But there was something about him \u2013 part brute, part beauty. He had grace, swagger, energy, sexuality. His contradictions made for a thrilling presence. The first time I met him, he gave a little bow when he introduced himself. He may have been 1.9 metres (6ft 2in) tall and heavily set, but he reminded me of a geisha.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t think anybody enjoys their family dying. I liked all mine. But what can you do? It\u2019s the final act in life</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In films, he has excelled at preening seducers. There are the obvious ones (the foppish predator Valmont in Dangerous Liaisons) and the less obvious (crazed Mitch Leary in In the Line of Fire is utterly bewitching). He can still be every bit as seductive today \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/02/the-new-pope-review-john-malkovich-paolo-sorrentino-jude-law\">his fabulously vain John Paul III</a> in Paolo Sorrentino\u2019s classy TV series The New Pope is irresistible.</p> <p>Does he recognise himself in these characters? Not really, he says \u2013 apart from the vanity. \u201cMany of these characters are cold or cruel or intellectual.\u201d Is he cold in real life? He sounds hurt. \u201cMaybe shy sometimes. I don\u2019t think anybody who knew me would consider me cold. I may be wrong. And seducer the same \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t associate it with myself. Intellectual I wouldn\u2019t associate with myself. More class clown than any of that.\u201d</p> <p>He says he loves playing for laughs. One of my favourite Malkovich films is a little-known comedy called The Great Buck Howard, in which he plays a famous magician fallen on hard times. It is a gloriously hammy performance. He sounds delighted when I tell him. \u201cYeah, I enjoyed doing that immensely and am glad you noticed. I prefer to have fun.\u201d</p> <p>Really? There are so many stories of him being tough and intimidating, I say. \u201cI was athletic and I guess fairly strong in some ways, but don\u2019t consider myself tough; I don\u2019t consider myself someone looking for trouble.\u201d So these stories are apocryphal? Try me, he says. Well, what about the time you were mugged and ran home to get a knife, threw the mugger against a tree and said if he ever did it again he would be dead? \u201cIt\u2019s pretty apocryphal,\u201d he says. OK, the time you broke a bus window with your fist in temper? \u201cTrue. They wouldn\u2019t let me get on the bus.\u201d Were you in a lot of pain afterwards? \u201cI was, yes.\u201d</p> <p>Malkovich does bullying rage with aplomb on screen. He recently played a character based on Harvey Weinstein in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jun/19/bitter-wheat-review-malkovich-and-mamets-monstrous-misfire\">the David Mamet farce Bitter Wheat</a>. So many actors tell you they need to be able to sympathise with their characters, but Malkovich\u2019s isn\u2019t having any of that. \u201cI don\u2019t feel the need to be sympathetic. I didn\u2019t see much in that character to feel sympathetic with.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2d61284fc88ad82ad964b90793e5864842a4df55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d61284fc88ad82ad964b90793e5864842a4df55/0_0_1873_2050/914.jpg\" alt=\"John Malkovich playing a version of himself in Being John Malkovich.\" width=\"914\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I don\u2019t consider it to be so much about me as about the nature of celebrity\u2019 ... playing a version of himself in Being John Malkovich.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext Collection/Sportsphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Was he shocked that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/harvey-weinstein-sentencing-rape-conviction\">Weinstein got a 23-year prison sentence</a>? \u201cI was shocked he even got a sentence. I don\u2019t know anybody who believed he would go to jail.\u201d He says it is too early to know whether the #MeToo movement has changed the culture of the film industry, but he hopes so. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible thing if somebody\u2019s job depends on what sexual favour they will give in return for work.\u201d Was that the culture? \u201cSure.\u201d</p> <p>Did he experience it first-hand? \u201cWhen I was young, I had a professor in the theatre department who made some advances that were unwanted. I was 19, he was in his 50s.\u201d Malkovich says he was lucky. \u201cI just said it wasn\u2019t my thing, sorry. It was someone I was fond of and I liked. So life went on. I did transfer schools, but not really because of that. The Weinstein situation is very different. It was transactional. It\u2019s terrible for women, but it\u2019s horrific also just for the idea of work.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps Malkovich\u2019s best-known film is Being John Malkovich \u2013 the brilliant absurdist comedy in which a puppeteer discovers a portal into the actor\u2019s head and then flogs tickets for it to the public. Malkovich plays Malkovich, or the Malkovich we think we know from his parts \u2013 serious-minded, arty, sleazy, with a volcanic temper. \u201cI don\u2019t consider it to be so much about me as about the future and about the nature of celebrity.\u201d He says that when he read the script, he loved it, but he asked the screenwriter, Charlie Kaufman, if he could direct it and Kaufman could make it about Tom Cruise. Kaufman gave him a firm no.</p> <p>For a number of years, Malkovich lived in France with his family (his children are 30 and 28). Now he is back in the US, living in Cambridge, Massachusetts, just outside Boston. Throughout lockdown, he has been at home with Peyran, now an academic, and their daughter, Amandine, who works in a grocery shop; his son, Loewy, is in Oregon, computer coding. No actors, then? \u201cOh, no!\u201d He sounds pleased.</p> <p>The actor has a reputation as a warmongering neo-con \u2013 he was in favour of invading Iraq and once said of the death penalty: \u201cI would have no problem pushing the switch while having dinner.\u201d But today he tells me he can\u2019t stand politics and hasn\u2019t voted since 1972\u2019s US presidential election, when he cast his ballot for the Democrat, George McGovern. \u201cI guess I think the system is pretty corrupt.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdpYpulGCKc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bdpYpulGCKc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>The spoof is out there ... watch the trailer for Space Force.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Yet his latest project is a political satire. Created by the celebrated TV comedy writer Greg Daniels and Steve Carell, Space Force stars Malkovich as a slow-talking scientist alongside Carell\u2019s manic General Mark R Naird. It is uneven, but entertaining \u2013 part Dr Strangelove, part Veep, part soppy soap. Donald Trump has said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/may/16/spacewatch-nasa-wants-one-point-six-billion-dollars-next-year-to-get-astronauts-to-moon-by-2024\">he </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/may/16/spacewatch-nasa-wants-one-point-six-billion-dollars-next-year-to-get-astronauts-to-moon-by-2024\">wants to get astronauts back on the moon by 2024</a>, but Malkovich says the concept predates the president\u2019s ambition. Does he think it is a good idea to revisit the moon? \u201cI don\u2019t know. It might be a better idea than creating more lethal versions of viruses in labs,\u201d he says, gnomically. \u201cBut it may not be the best idea we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d </p> <p>I ask why he is working so hard these days \u2013 for the love or the money? Both, he says. \u201cI always love working.\u201d Again, he says, he has been lucky.</p> <p>But you have not always been lucky, I say \u2013 I was staggered to read that three of his four siblings (all of whom became journalists) died in their 50s. It must have been devastating, I say. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cBut what can you do about it? Amanda, then Mother, then Danny, then Rebecca \u2013 and that was all over a five-year period from 2009.\u201d Did it prompt an existential crisis? \u201cNo. I try not to worry about things I can\u2019t control. Unless, say, you had a terrible mother, I don\u2019t think anybody enjoys their family or siblings dying. I liked all mine. But what can you do? It\u2019s the final act in life.\u201d</p> <p>It is unusual to find someone so accepting. Does he have a religion, a guiding philosophy? \u201cNot really,\u201d he says. He tells me a story \u2013 about shooting a film in a small town in Canada and being asked to talk to a little boy with leukaemia, whose hair had fallen out. \u201cThey wanted me to talk to him because people somehow think people in the movies have some power to do good. He was self-conscious about his hair, and I said: \u2018We\u2019ve got the same haircut,\u2019 and he said: \u2018Yes, but not for the same reason.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cAnd that is how I look at life; I was very lucky. I\u2019ve been luckier than anybody I know. Luckier than all of the children in my family, all of whom were more interesting or more talented or smarter than me. So when things have happened that have been sad and difficult, I don\u2019t feel the need to complain about them.\u201d</p> <p>So, in a way, that is a philosophy, I say \u2013 and a surprisingly positive one for someone who sounds so relentlessly downbeat. \u201cYeah!\u201d he says, with an audible surge of enthusiasm. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a negative influence. I think I\u2019m quite a positive person, all in all.\u201d</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/81021929\">Space Force</a> is available to stream on Netflix from 29 May</em></p>"
