The plan is likely to be as controversial since Russia has been banned from western-led summits following Putin\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014, and is not seen as a natural ally in the fight to defend human rights in Hong Kong.</p> \n  <p>Merkel and the French President Emmanuel Macron will also be reluctant to provide Trump with a prestigious platform, weeks ahead of the US Presidential election, to set out his China strategy.

The US is the worst-affected country in terms of cases and deaths, with 1,769,776 infections and 103,685 fatalities.</li> \n   <li><strong>Donald Trump postpones G7 summit and signals wider attendance list. </strong>In a dramatic pivot, US president Donald Trump has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/31/donald-trump-postpones-g7-summit-and-signals-wider-attendance-list-in-future\">postponed the Group of Seven</a> summit that he wanted to hold in June. He will also expand the list of countries invited to attend the rescheduled event to include Australia, Russia, South Korea and India. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One during his return to Washington from Cape Canaveral in Florida, Trump said the G7 in its current format was a \u201cvery outdated group of countries. I\u2019m postponing it because I don\u2019t feel that as a G7 it properly represents what\u2019s going on in the world.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>Key UK election battlegrounds face double hit. </strong>Key English election battlegrounds in the north-west and Midlands will be severely exposed to a double economic hit from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/31/key-election-battlegrounds-face-double-hit-from-brexit-and-coronavirus\">Brexit and coronavirus</a> should the UK fail to secure an EU trade deal by the end of the year, new analysis has warned. Boris Johnson has continued to rule out any extension to Britain\u2019s EU transition deal, which expires from January. It comes despite a deadlock in talks about a future trade deal, before the final round of talks this week.</li> \n   <li><strong>Pressure builds on South African president. </strong>South African president Cyril Ramaphosa faces a fresh leadership test over his handling of the coronavirus outbreak as Africa\u2019s most industrialised nation prepares to reopen its economy on Monday. South Africa had already slipped into recession in the final quarter of 2019 before the virus arrived in March, and the rand has depreciated by 22.9% since January. Under eased restrictions, all but high-risk sectors of the economy will be allowed to reopen on Monday. The country reported 1,727 new cases, taking the cumulative total to 30,967.</li> \n   <li><strong>Brazil cases near 500,000. </strong>Brazil registered a record 33,274 new cases of the novel coronavirus on Saturday, its health ministry said, raising the total to 498,440 in a country with one of the world\u2019s worst outbreaks. The death toll in Brazil from Covid-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus, increased to 28,834, with 956 new deaths in the last 24 hours, the ministry said.</li> \n   <li><strong>Los Angeles shuts down Covid-19 testing amid protests. </strong>Coronavirus testing centres in Los Angeles, California have been closed due to safety concerns amid protests over the death of George Floyd, according to LA Mayor Eric Garcetti, who said the centres were being closed \u201cbecause of the safety worries across the city\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>South Korea reports 27 new cases. </strong>South Korea has reported 27 new cases of the coronavirus, including 21 from the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, where officials have been scrambling to stem transmissions linked to club-goers and warehouse workers. The figures announced by South Korea\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Sunday brought national totals to 11,468 cases and 270 deaths. Twelve of the new cases were linked to international arrivals.</li> \n   <li><strong>Pope calls for world leaders to provide relief. </strong>Pope Francis implored world leaders to provide social and economic relief for the many workers who have lost jobs, and called for the enormous sums of money used to grow and perfect armaments be instead used to fund research to prevent similar catastrophes in the future.</li> \n   <li><strong>Cummings affair a danger to life, say experts. </strong>Britain\u2019s top public health leaders warned Boris Johnson that trust in the government has been shattered by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/dominic-cummings\">Dominic Cummings</a> affair and now poses real danger to life when lockdown measures are lifted this week. Cummings, Johnson\u2019s top aide, has been embroiled in a scandal after he was seen in Durham, 264 miles from his London home, despite having had coronavirus symptoms.

  "<p>University leaders have reacted angrily to the UK government\u2019s plan to control the number of students from England who can study in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, saying that it was punishing them for problems caused by the coronavirus outbreak in England.</p> <p>The Department for Education in England is expected to confirm a cap on the number of undergraduates each university can recruit this autumn \u2013 limiting institutions to an increase of no more than 6.5% in the number of new students \u2013 in a bid to stop institutions poaching students from their rivals.</p> <p>But universities and ministers in the devolved administrations said they have been shocked to learn that the DfE wants to impose the same limits on Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, despite higher education policy being devolved to individual governments.</p> <p>Sally Mapstone, the vice-chancellor of the University of St Andrews, said: \u201cThere\u2019s been no consultation about this with Scottish universities at all. When we first heard about it, it was a real shock to the sector, it was a surprise to government and to the funding councils. We feel we\u2019ve been completely blindsided by this.\u201d</p> <p>Mapstone said the decision by the UK government had come at \u201can incredibly difficult time for student recruitment\u201d, with uncertainty over the number of students attending higher education next year.</p> <p>Some universities are forecasting that the number of international students enrolling in September could drop by 50% in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic, leaving holes that some have aggressively tried to fill with UK students.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s really galling is that the student number controls were in part brought in because of unacceptable and unscrupulous behaviour by a number of English universities,\u201d Mapstone said.</p> <p>\u201cBut there is no evidence whatsoever that Scottish universities have behaved badly. We were not in that group, so to effectively penalise us for something that stems in part from behaviour south of the border seems inappropriate.\u201d</p> <p>Close to 18,000 students from England travel to Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland each year to start undergraduate degrees. Welsh universities are particularly popular with English students, with Cardiff University admitting nearly 60% of its undergraduates from across the border.</p> <p>Colin Riordan, the vice-chancellor of Cardiff University, said: \u201cIf there is any intention to limit the numbers of English students that can study in Wales, that would be a real problem and it just does not make any sense.\u201d</p> <p>Riordan said Cardiff and other universities have already sent out offers to their applicants and many would have already accepted university places.</p> <p>\u201cThat puts us in a contractual position with them, so I don\u2019t know how that would pan out. What I\u2019m hoping is that this is some sort of mix-up that hasn\u2019t been thought through, or it\u2019s some sort of mistake that can be resolved,\u201d Riordan said.</p> <p>Michelle Donelan, the universities minister for England, is to hold a further meeting with her counterparts on Monday, with further details to be announced next week, according to the DfE.</p> <p>Anton Muscatell, the vice-chancellor of the University of Glasgow, said: \u201cIf an agreement is reached between the governments, it is important that Scottish institutions are treated fairly, on similar terms to English institutions.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/21/universities-brink-crisis-coronavirus-pandemic-tuition-fees\">Universities are on the brink of crisis.

Edinburgh declined to comment on the student numbers cap extension.</p> <p>Alastair Sim, the director of the Universities Scotland group, described the new policy as \u201ca late and low blow\u201d and said: \u201cThe UK government\u2019s package of measures for UK universities in early May was England-only in the financial support it offered but it now seems to be UK-wide when it comes to the controls. This is unacceptable.\u201d</p> <p>Emma Hardy, Labour\u2019s shadow minister for universities, said the UK government needed to ensure the health of the sector in the coronavirus aftermath.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a need for stability in the system and temporary number controls. However, any decision on how this is implemented must be done in conjunction with both the Welsh and Scottish governments,\u201d Hardy said.</p>",
  "<p>As the beginning of the end of lockdown comes into view in England, a new fear should be taking shape. We entered the pandemic a grossly unequal society; we will leave it with those inequalities sharpened and multiplied.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is a pandemic of two halves. If in the first we began to see the fault lines that separated us, in the second those cracks will gape open. The first quake began to shake the political ground last week \u2013&nbsp;as a government that has dithered its way to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6b4c784e-c259-4ca4-9a82-648ffde71bf0\">second highest death rate</a> in the world heaped scorn on the public it failed to protect, in order to save one of its own. What started out as a firm but restrained <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/24/boris-johnson-defence-dominic-cummings-anger-from-allies-and-opponents-alike\">refusal to admit any wrongdoing</a> on the part of Dominic Cummings has descended into menace and mockery. Boris Johnson is aggressive and ratty during the daily briefings. Ministers such as Matt Hancock and Michael Gove <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/29/track-and-trace-is-no-laughing-matter-so-dont-turn-it-into-a-farce\">laugh</a> and <a href=\"https://www.thenational.scot/news/18475795.dominic-cummings-michael-gove-laughs-way-eyesight-claim/\">scoff</a> in interviews. It\u2019s time to move on, we are told.&nbsp;</p> <p>If there was any doubt about the true nature of this government, it has now been erased: the country is run by a small, tight-knit group of arrogant and talentless entitleds. Apart from riding the public to office, they have no interest in our safety \u2013 or our respect. We must do our duty and submit, because these are the new pandemic rules, stripped back to an essence that in normal times would be more carefully obscured. In short: know your place.</p> <p>Any illusions that we were ever protected from the rank contempt of our rulers by the logic of democracy \u2013 because the government embodies the will of the people who elected it \u2013 are now gone. Their only concern was for the will that brought them to power. And now, many more protections that we imagined were still in place \u2013 from unemployment, from homelessness, from risks to our health in the workplace \u2013&nbsp;will crumble into dust, as our society splits even more decisively into a small group of winners and a large mass of losers.&nbsp;</p> <p>Divisions are becoming more exposed each week. Already the labour force has become divided between those who can work from home and those who must go out and be on the frontline of the government\u2019s experiment in easing the lockdown; between those who can continue to cocoon and those who cannot afford to, because they are paid for piecework for each physical task \u2013&nbsp;a clean house, a day on a construction site, a hot meal delivered to your door.</p> <p>There are workers who have formal contracts that treat their labour as a service performed by a human being who has the right to notice, severance pay and protection from abuse. And there are those who have no protection from the whims of their bosses to dictate their treatment and fate. As the predicted recession bites and unemployment rises, the power that employers have over zero-hours workers grateful to have any income will produce more and more abuses, especially for undocumented workers.</p> <p>Those workers are themselves part of a larger group of migrants whose legal and formal status will not fortify them against the aftershocks of the pandemic.&nbsp;Accustomed to overpaying for their visas, residence permits and access to the NHS, they have contributed taxes and fees over the years that still do not afford them any <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/29/boris-johnson-baffled-britain-migration-laws\">access to public funds</a>. For them, there is no safety net.</p> <p>But there are still many who are even less fortunate than able-bodied workers eking out a precarious living: those for whom there is no clear end of lockdown in sight. The suspension of our lives will not end as suddenly and decisively as it began. We will be released back into our lives in batches. The healthy, the young, the able-bodied and those privileged enough to have help and care will be first. But there is another nation of shielders for whom there is still no long-term clarity. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/30/lockdown-to-be-eased-for-englands-most-clinically-vulnerable\">Advice</a> that they can go outside came suddenly and with no explanation of the risk profile or preparation for this next phase. However their vulnerability was cushioned during the universal phase of lockdown, either through the kindness of friends and family providing food and care, or through a furlough scheme that has staved off financial pain, these means will soon end. Non-shielding helpers will return to their own lives and jobs, and the furlough scheme will taper off.&nbsp;</p> <p>With its end, the most dramatic inequality of all will kick in, as the furloughed find that they have no jobs to return to and no reprieve from their financial obligations. The unemployment contagion effect is already working its way through the economy. The owner of a small family-run estate agent told me last week that he spends the majority of his time since returning to work negotiating between landlords and tenants who have defaulted on their rent, trying to stave off evictions, and winding down tenancies only when people have found somewhere to go. When I asked him how much worse it\u2019s going to get after the end of the furlough scheme, he said, \u201cI get white hair just thinking about it.\u201d</p> <p>The pandemic quickly thrived in society\u2019s cracks, claiming lives and livelihoods according to race, access to healthcare, work risk profile and economic status. Next it will open up even larger fissures. Considering the collective trauma that we have gone through, we can be allowed a moment of relief as a \u201creturn to normal\u201d begins to take shape. But it may be brief: now the task will be to scrutinise the unforgiving new landscape of sharpened inequalities, and \u2013 instead of turning on each other \u2013&nbsp;do whatever we can to soften them.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist<br></p>",

Our concern is people will feel reluctant to participate if they feel their personal data is leaving their control.\u201d</p> <p>Newly employed contact tracers have been tasked with interviewing people who test positive for coronavirus \u2013 currently a little over 2,000 a day \u2013 and asking them who they came into close contact with in the two weeks before becoming infected.</p> <p>The tracers will then call those people and ask them to self-isolate \u2013 and if they do not become sick their personal data will be retained by the NHS in England for a shorter period of five years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/contact_trace_app-zip/giv-3902m6WvhumRbMZn/\" data-alt=\"how contact tracing works graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/contact_trace_app-zip/giv-3902m6WvhumRbMZn/\">how contact tracing works graphic</a> </figure>  <p>Concerns raised by the ORG include whether the personally identifiable data retained could be subsequently obtained by the Home Office or other government departments for immigration or other purposes.</p> <p>The privacy group is also unhappy that the government has <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-test-trace-privacy-data-impact-assessement/\">failed to complete a legally</a><a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-test-trace-privacy-data-impact-assessement/\"> mandated data protection impact assessment</a>, which is supposed to be filed with the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office before any \u201chigh-risk\u201d activity is carried out.</p> <p>The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has argued that existing data protection law is sufficient, while last week Lady Dido Harding, the chair of NHS test-and-trace programme, said any data collected wold be part of \u201can NHS conversation, entirely confidential\u201d.</p> <p>However, senior politicians <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/15/mps-and-peers-call-for-legal-requirement-to-delete-uk-contract-tracing-data\">have called for ministers to introduce </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/15/mps-and-peers-call-for-legal-requirement-to-delete-uk-contract-tracing-data\"> legislation </a> to safeguard data privacy, arguing that oral reassurances are insufficient.</p> <p>In a letter seen by the Guardian, Harriet Harman, the chair of the influential joint committee on human rights (JCHR), wrote to Hancock, arguing that \u201cthese new powers require new protections\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems to us absolutely evident that the bill is needed,\u201d Harman told the Guardian. \u201cAnd instead of looking ahead to that fact, they\u2019re going to wait until it\u2019s urgent. Public opinion is very volatile about this sort of thing. One minute everyone can be seeing the absolute good sense, and the next they can have a lot of worries about it.\u201d</p> <p>Harman said the 20-year limit risked losing the trust of the public, and giving authorities too much leeway. \u201cOur goal is to make the promises that [Hancock] has already made meaningful. Assurances in a letter don\u2019t protect anyone. What protects people is legislation,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d rather they just did the bill, because I don\u2019t want to be turning around and saying \u2018I told you so\u2019 when there\u2019s some sort of scare and confidence collapses and the important test-trace-isolate initiative hits a roadblock.\u201d</p> <p>The JCHR, a cross-party committee that includes members from both houses of parliament, took the unusual step of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/15/mps-and-peers-call-for-legal-requirement-to-delete-uk-contract-tracing-data\">drafting its own bill</a> enshrining in law the requirement to delete gathered information after the end of the outbreak. \u201cThis is what Boris Johnson would describe as oven-ready,\u201d said Harman. \u201cI just think they\u2019re being irrational about it, and unwise, and are going to make things more difficult.\u201d</p> <p>In the letter to Hancock, Harman lays out 10 areas where existing law does not match the promises the government has made, from security to anonymisation.</p> <p>PHE said it was standard practice across the NHS to securely retain data for the benefit of both patients and wider public health, and that all data collection and storage is fully compliant with <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation\">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018.</p> <p>Separately, a rightwing thinktank has said an independent reviewer would bee needed to review coronavirus emergency powers and surveillance measures if they look like becoming permanent.</p> <p>A report from the Henry Jackson Society concluded that \u201ccontinued scrutiny\u201d of the powers under the Coronavirus Act was vital and should reflect the system of oversight used for terrorism legislation.</p> <p>Existing rules provide for an independent reviewer of terrorism legislation \u2013 Jonathan Hall QC \u2013 who scrutinises and reports on security bills and has access to sensitive and secret information to carry out their job.</p> <p>Nikita Malik, the author of the Leaving Lockdown report, said that the government\u2019s response to Covid-19 had involved \u201cnavigating the balance between civil liberties and national security\u201d and that \u201cwhat was needed now was greater transparency, oversight, and accountability.</p> <p>Malik also highlighted attempts to consolidate NHS databases in work being conducted to help ministers respond to the pandemic by the data mining firms Palantir and Faculty, the second of which worked on the Vote Leave campaign in 2016. The report said there were \u201cconcerns around \u2018surveillance creep\u2019 where intrusive powers are expanded or data is used to prosecute for a range of crimes\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>I wandered like a zombie into a social media argument about Kellyanne Conway, adviser to Donald Trump. I think I was looking for some outrage in public discourse I knew nothing about, to take my mind off the outrages I knew too much about. \u201cPeople will wait in line for an hour for a Georgetown cupcake,\u201d she said, \u201cso I think they can probably wait in line to do something as consequential as \u2026 cast their ballot.\u201d Her case didn\u2019t look especially strong \u2013 taking the most indulgent and absurd thing that the time-rich, regular-rich person might sometimes do, and trying to extrapolate a voting system from it.&nbsp;</p> <p>But I couldn\u2019t keep my eyes on the bigger picture; all I could think about was the queueing. This is our life now. When I dream about chance encounters with lost friends, they happen outside the Co-op. On the great scroll of things we\u2019re not really allowed to complain about, queueing is at the top. It\u2019s a trivial inconvenience, in the grand scheme of the disaster. And it\u2019s part of our national story, the one thing we are still supposed to be good at, after \u201csound governance\u201d and \u201cstiff upper lips\u201d didn\u2019t pan out so well.&nbsp;</p> <p>So OK, deport me: I hate it. It was worse at the start of physical distancing, when all the unknowability of the outside world seemed to distill into these completely random shopping experiences: would it be an hour? Would it be five minutes? Would you ever move again? I stood for 20 minutes in the underground car park of a Waitrose, watching a queue that was so still it was like an oil painting by an artist who (for a lot of totes legitimate and understandable reasons) vehemently hated the middle classes. I got so close,&nbsp;<em>so close</em>, to the inside of a butcher\u2019s, when the person ahead of me decided he would like one of each animal, whole, boned and rolled, and also he would like to learn how to tie a butcher\u2019s knot. I waited outside a Tesco, where we were patrolled by an attendant to check we were standing far enough apart. I felt like he should go full sergeant major and try to get us to stand up straight while he was at it. \u201cJust leave the guy alone,\u201d said Mr Z.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing anything to him! I\u2019m just thinking things about small amounts of power and what they do to a person.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cYou know, of everything anyone has ever thought, that is the most obvious.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>What were we doing in a queue together? That\u2019s crazy. That is like making your spouse take a blood test or a speed-awareness course, just because you have to. I can\u2019t remember. I always thought he loathed the enterprise even more than I did, but then he said he didn\u2019t hate queueing, he only hated it with me, because he found the air of delinquent restiveness very stressful. \u201c<em>My&nbsp;</em>delinquent restiveness?\u201d I said, astonished, because, from where I was standing \u2013 squarely on my line of black and yellow tape \u2013 if anyone was going to rush the doors screaming, \u201cI am not a number, I am a free man\u201d (or its lockdown variant, <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/tiny-crowd-shows-up-anti-22037507\">\u201cI am a free I am not MAN a NUMBER\u201d</a>), it would definitely be him.&nbsp;</p> <p>I got into an argument outside Sainsbury\u2019s with someone who disputed the accuracy of the two-metre mark which, in the absence of a tape measure \u2013 and if we hadn\u2019t been let in that minute \u2013 would have definitely resulted in me lying down on the ground, going: \u201cIs this, or is this not, 22cm longer than me?\u201d I found a hack, which is that people very rarely queue outside the mini-supermarkets attached to garages, and for a while that is the only place I went, and all we ate was Ginsters pasties and string cheese. The queue outside the fish and chip shop looked like party central, since a lot of us already knew each other from dog walking. But it was like turning up single to a swingers\u2019 party. We were hollow and speechless without our dogs. Maybe we had never been talking in the first place; maybe it was just the dogs that were talking? I shuffled away shyly, saying: \u201cNext time, I\u2019ll definitely bring Romeo.\u201d But I was thinking: \u201cThe only way that queue would have been worse is if my dog had been in it. I guess that\u2019s the end of fish and chips.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>There was never any reason for this to change, and yet, slowly, subtly, it did. If you make your calculations finely enough now, you can arrive at a shop without any queue, and glide around feeling magnificent, as if you have paid for a VIP fast-track at Legoland. So it is better, but it is also worse, because the resignation that had set in has now evaporated, and the dismay when you arrive to find a line is as fresh as it was in March. It is probably something the mindfulness racket could solve \u2013 what is a queue, after all, but a pocket of me-time, weightless, devoid of any duty but to exist and move along when instructed? It should be possible to enjoy it. But I would rather live on string cheese.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>I spent a lot of last year walking to and from hospital. On the way, I would pass an unprepossessing patch of grass, optimistically referred to as the local park, and consider how fantastically bleak it was that for our neighbourhood, this \u2013 <em>this</em> \u2013 constituted a public space.</p> <p>I\u2019d contrast it with sprawling, endless Hyde Park, my favourite spot in London, aside from when it\u2019s commandeered by irresponsible fringe lunatics holding their toxic rallies (Michael Bubl\u00e9\u2019s British Summer Time concert, 2018).</p> <p>This place, in comparison, was limp and joyless, with sad, bare little trees, a scrap of lawn and a squat hut in one corner that turned out on closer inspection to be a sewage pumping station \u2013 a northerner\u2019s idea of what a London green space is like.</p> <p>In the past few months, which I have spent largely trapped in one room, the park has begun to resemble the garden of Eden.</p> <p>Away from the vast, unimaginable tragedies and the small, stinging necessities of the real pandemic, there are the quirks of lockdown. And while our experiences are all different, they are not very different \u2013 that is one of the quirks.</p> <p>The great revelation for me has been the way that our worlds have become atomised, and how they have shrunk. For those of us still working, the fragmentation of office life has removed all sorts of mental barriers. Everything suddenly seems more manageable and less intimidating. I am forever talking one-on-one, with no one to overhear, and everyone\u2019s lives on partial display; apologising for the washing machine in the background, or breaking off to ask a child to shut up. The glorious anarchy of real life has breached the po-faced masquerade of the corporate world. We are all <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/mar/14/robert-kelly-children-interrupt-live-bbc-interview-south-korea\">Prof Robert Kelly now</a>.</p> <p>The shrinking has been interesting too \u2013 and ironic. For the first time since I came to London, I know my neighbours. And now I know them, I can\u2019t go within two metres of them. Or within three fridges of them, if we\u2019re using the new national system of measurement.</p> <p>The wallpaper of my life has been pulled down, so I have had to hang a new one. I sit by the window to work, and I have got used to the rhythms of other people\u2019s lives in a way that usually only happens when you\u2019re close to someone. There\u2019s the woman across the street who stands outside smoking and, when she sees someone she knows, illuminates from within like a plastic snowman. There\u2019s the teenager who takes his football for a walk every afternoon, the straps of his mask cutting into his towering bouffant; the pregnant lady in the gargantuan ice-white trainers; the bloke with the motorbike and the Queen hoodie. I am so grateful for this pantomime of familiarity that I\u2019m not even going to be rude about Queen. During the weekly clap for frontline workers, we would all smile quietly at one another.&nbsp;Life&nbsp;resembles a wholesome <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/jul/25/my-favourite-hitchcock-rear-window\">Rear Window</a>.</p> <p>Other film homages have been less enjoyable to live through. I don\u2019t dare venture as far as Hyde Park because the walk to get there is too busy. I went once, on the last day before lockdown, and Kensington High Street possessed the chilled out ambience and heartening community spirit of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/mar/26/dvdreviews.shopping7\">Dawn of the Dead</a>.</p> <p>My favourite escape routes, then \u2013 a large, cherished park, the intensity of live music \u2013 are out of bounds. But just as strangers have stepped unknowingly into the void left by friendly faces, so the small familiar area around my house has risen to its challenge. Not just the sun-baked streets of early summer, but the red brick and blue plaques, the houses that tumble down the road from the terracotta tube station, and that small neighbourhood green space I used to malign.</p> <p>I took a notebook there to finish this piece. Walking anywhere now is slightly stressful: I\u2019m an absolutist about social distancing, so spend most of the journey in the road. That was intimidating even before <a href=\"https://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/presenters/nick-ferrari/michael-gove-driving-eyesight-cummings-baranard/\">Michael Gove</a> suggested that anyone worried about their eyesight should immediately drive a car.</p> <p>Outside the park there is one world \u2013 PRACTISE SAFE DISTANCING, screams a banner strapped to the railings \u2013 and inside there is another, as the leaves at the entrance, turned half-spectral by the sun, reach down to lift you away. The grass is burnt, worn and bare already,&nbsp;but with a beauty of its own, and around the walls, penned in by houses,&nbsp;are&nbsp;untold&nbsp;gradations of green.&nbsp;In the middle-distance, the trees look shaggy and stoned.</p> <p>The park is made of irregular, impractical shapes, fenced off from one another by low, black railings, for which there must be some invisible reason. Now I love its imperfections like you love a person\u2019s imperfections, its limitations and flaws. There is a misshapen stone slab in the middle of the grass, and a hole where there was once a tree. The day before, I was almost decapitated there by a Frisbee.</p> <p>Someone has chalked EID MUBARAK on the concrete. Further along there are rainbows and the outlines of dancing people. Amid all the hurt there is some measure of happiness.</p> <p>As our worlds have shrunk, my park has grown, and I have grown to love it.</p> <p>\u2022 Rick Burin is a writer from the north of England<br></p>",

  "<p>Every Thursday at 8pm, millions of Britons have opened their front doors or stood on balconies to applaud the NHS. The ritual has been a weekly expression of gratitude to medical workers, and national pride in a state-run health service said to be the envy of the world.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s not forget,\u201d Boris Johnson said in early March, near the start of the coronavirus crisis, \u201cwe already have a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-at-coronavirus-press-conference-3-march-2020\">fantastic NHS,</a> fantastic testing systems and fantastic surveillance of the spread of disease.\u201d</p> <p>Yet those who have experienced the government\u2019s emerging testing and tracing operations for Covid-19 have had limited contact with the NHS. Instead, Britons with symptoms are directed to a network of 50 drive-through testing centres, set up by management consultants at Deloitte.</p> <p>Upon arrival, patients are marshalled not by NHS staff, but workers in hi-vis jackets supplied by outsourcing companies, such as Serco, G4S, Mitie and Sodexo. Those who cannot make the drive have received postal test kits, processed by the private diagnostics company Randox and delivered by Amazon.</p> <p>When contact tracing to stop the spread of the virus finally moved up the agenda in late April, the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, said <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-23-april-2020\">the job</a> would be done with an as\u2013yet unproven NHS app. The app has been developed by private firms for NHSX, the technology wing of the health service, which is also responsible for a Covid-19 government data operation involving tech companies Palantir, Faculty, Amazon, Google and Microsoft.</p> <p>On Thursday the government finally launched its long-awaited NHS Test and Trace Service. But despite the name, many of the 25,000 contact tracers tracking those potentially exposed to Covid-19 and advising them to self-isolate will be working not for the NHS, but rather the outsourcing firms Serco and Sitel.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/testing-flowchart-zip/giv-3902BxUIKiVHGDMV/\" data-alt=\"Testing infrastructure\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/testing-flowchart-zip/giv-3902BxUIKiVHGDMV/\">Testing infrastructure</a> </figure>  <p>The government\u2019s reliance on private contractors during the public health emergency comes after a decade of public sector reorganisation, marketisation and deep cuts to services and local government in England. The Guardian has interviewed dozens of public health directors, politicians, experts in infectious disease control, government scientific and political advisers, NHS leaders and emergency planners about the years leading up to the pandemic.</p> <p>They described how an infrastructure that was once in place to respond to public health crises was fractured, and in some places demolished, by policies introduced by recent Conservative governments, with some changes going as far back as Labour\u2019s years in power.</p> <p>\u201cThe undermining of our responsiveness to a pandemic was one of my major concerns,\u201d said Gabriel Scally, a professor of public health at the University of Bristol and a former regional director of public health in the NHS for almost 20 years. \u201cThere has been a destruction of the infrastructure that stops England coping with major emergencies. It absolutely explains why you\u2019re now seeing private companies being brought into these functions.\u201d</p> <h2>Councils left in the dark</h2> <p>Local authorities are the Cinderellas of government, their work often overlooked. But in the middle of a public health crisis, counties, districts and boroughs traditionally become the foot soldiers of national response. Few have been as badly hit as the east London borough of Newham, the local authority with the highest Covid-19 mortality rate in England and Wales.</p> <p>Yet Newham\u2019s director of public health, Jason Strelitz, was left in the dark at the start. He had no official notification that the virus had arrived in his area in mid-March, and only found out when he logged on to the government\u2019s public coronavirus tracker web page to make his daily check on the declared numbers. Strelitz did not know who in Newham had Covid-19, where they had been tested, or which part of the borough they came from.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re really concerned about the way national testing has been set up,\u201d Strelitz said. \u201cWe still don\u2019t have a clear picture of who is being tested in our area nor of the extent of community transmission in Newham.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81c1fc9fd1174ab1ca7d1417a9310c2de5419d02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81c1fc9fd1174ab1ca7d1417a9310c2de5419d02/1100_1065_4876_2927/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jason Strelitz at the Covid-19 hub for local authority action in Newham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jason Strelitz at the Covid-19 hub for local authority action in Newham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In normal times, a Public Health England (PHE) representative would be expected to contact Strelitz\u2019s environmental health teams if a case of a notifiable disease was found in the area that needed following up, enabling them to set to work tracing contacts and containing an outbreak.

Working on a salary just above minimum wage, the majority will have no medical training. Using scripts, they will contact those who have tested positive, trace people they have been in contact with, and advise them on how to isolate.</p> <p>\u201cContact tracing is a sensitive issue \u2013 I\u2019m not sure how well it can be done with a remote call centre with no understanding of people\u2019s local context,\u201d Strelitz said.</p> <p>Dominic Harrison, the director of public health for Blackburn and Darwen, has similar concerns.

Nottingham has had its central government support grant cut by 80% since 2013 and, like many other councils, no longer has reserves for emergencies such as coronavirus. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government has made an emergency grant of \u00a33.2bn to councils for Covid-19 costs, which the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, has <a href=\"https://mhclgmedia.blog.gov.uk/2020/05/14/response-to-lewis-goodall-newsnight-on-local-authority-funding/\">defended</a> as fair and generous. Mellen disagrees. Nottingham, he said, had been given \u00a319.8m as its share of the exceptional grant, but had already spent well over \u00a312m extra on Covid-19 while losing at least \u00a319m in revenue because of the lockdown.</p> <p>A Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) spokesperson did not dispute that cuts to central government grants could have had an impact on local public health networks. However, she pointed to the \u00a33.2bn emergency funding for councils, which she said was in addition to an increase of \u00a32.9bn in councils\u2019 core spending power this year. \u201cProtecting the public\u2019s health is, and has always been, a priority for the UK government,\u201d she said.</p> <h2>A decade of austerity</h2> <p>Next month, Britain will mark an anniversary many Conservative ministers would rather forget. Shortly after 12.30pm on 22 June 2010, George Osborne stepped up to the dispatch box as chancellor of the new coalition government and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/22/emergency-budget-full-speech-text\">announced</a> the longest and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/23/budget-longest-deepest-cuts-ifs\">deepest period of cuts</a> to public service spending since the second world war.</p> <p>Ushering in a new age of austerity to a raucous Commons, Osborne outlined \u00a381bn of cuts over five years. His aim was twofold: to eliminate the government\u2019s budget deficit and to reduce its debt as a share of GDP. The emergency budget would, he said, bring the country back from the brink of ruin. \u201cIt pays for the past. It plans for the future. And it protects the most vulnerable in our society,\u201d Osborne told MPs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=60%25&amp;title=cut%20in%20local%20authority%20funding%20from%20government%20since%202010\" data-alt=\"60% cut in local authority funding\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&number=60%25&title=cut%20in%20local%20authority%20funding%20from%20government%20since%202010\">60% cut in local authority funding</a> </figure>  <p>It was the prime minister, David Cameron, who had the previous year introduced the notion of \u201cthe age of irresponsibility giving way to the age of austerity\u201d. He said he expected the public spending cuts would be permanent as the private and voluntary sectors stepped in to deliver public services better than the state could. Some government departments would be cut by a third and most public sector workers would have to accept a pay freeze.</p> <p>Along with welfare, some of the most brutal reductions were imposed on local government in England as Osborne transferred the political risk of austerity to councils. Over the next decade, local authorities had 60% of their funding from central government cut, <a href=\"http://www.local.gov.uk/sites/default/files/documents/5.40_01_Finance%20publication_WEB_0.pdf\">according to the Local Government Association</a>. At the same time their ability to increase council tax, to try to replace the lost revenue, was capped. The cuts <a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/blog/public-health-cuts#anounce-of-prevention-is-worth-a-pound-of-cure\">fell disproportionately</a> on those authorities with the poorest populations.</p> <p>Cameron promised he would \u201ccut the deficit, not the NHS\u201d and Osborne ringfenced its budget. It got cash increases, but these were less than 1% a year, and failed to keep pace with growing demand from an ageing population.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=32%2C000&amp;title=overnight%20hospital%20beds%20cut%20in%20England%20since%202008-9\" data-alt=\"32,000 overnight beds lost since 2008-09\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&number=32%2C000&title=overnight%20hospital%20beds%20cut%20in%20England%20since%202008-9\">32,000 overnight beds lost since 2008-09</a> </figure>  <p>Approximately 32,000 overnight beds have been <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/bed-availability-and-occupancy/bed-data-overnight/\">lost</a> from hospitals in England in just over a decade, including some lost under Labour. Allyson Pollock, a professor of public health at Newcastle University, points out that the number of beds lost is roughly the same as the beds the NHS had to scramble <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/2020/04/nightingale-ldn-discharges-first/\">to free up for Covid-19</a> patients.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=33%2C000&amp;title=hospital%20beds%20reconfigured%20for%20Covid-19%20at%20the%20end%20of%20March\" data-alt=\"33,000 hospital beds reconfigured for Covid-19\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&number=33%2C000&title=hospital%20beds%20reconfigured%20for%20Covid-19%20at%20the%20end%20of%20March\">33,000 hospital beds reconfigured for Covid-19</a> </figure>  <p>When the coronavirus spread to Europe earlier this year, the UK ranked 24th among European countries for its numbers of <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00134-012-2627-8/figures/1\">critical care beds</a>, with 6.6 per 100,000 population, compared with Germany, which topped the league with 29.2 per 100,000.</p> <h2>NHS fragmentation</h2> <p>Two years after Osborne\u2019s announcement, with austerity beginning to bite, the then health secretary, Andrew Lansley, embarked on a complete market-oriented restructuring of the NHS. Despite Cameron\u2019s pre-election promise that there would be no more pointless, <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/never-again\">disruptive top-down reorganisations</a>, critics argue that Lansley\u2019s 2012 Health and Social Care Act did just that.</p> <p>Labour had done its fair share of subjecting the NHS to upheaval. Its programme of building new hospitals under the private finance initiative required other hospital and community health services to close, and shrank bed numbers to help cover the high annual fees to private companies. It accelerated changes brought in by the Conservatives to mimic a market, and created NHS trusts that could operate as semi-autonomous corporate bodies. By 2006, Labour\u2019s reorganisations had created 152 primary care trusts (PCTs). Overarching priorities were set by regional strategic health authorities and the Department of Health.</p> <p>But every area still had a Public Health Observatory, which included infectious disease control teams. Under government pandemic plans, each had to identify rapid response teams for testing and tracing, and these were activated during the swine flu outbreak in 2009.</p> <p>Health authorities also had consultants in communicable disease control appointed at senior level on a par with NHS hospital consultants. An independent public body, the Health Protection Agency (HPA), provided specialist support on the threat of emerging diseases. There were critics of the structures, but in planning for emergencies there was, at least, a clear chain of command and control. \u201cLabour started the process of fragmenting public health but it was at least still integrated with communicable disease control and the NHS,\u201d Pollock said.</p> <p>Lansley\u2019s legislation did away with much of that. He abolished PCTs and strategic health authorities. Instead, existing public health structures were stripped out of the NHS and redistributed, along with their budgets and staff. In a dramatic shift, local authorities were given responsibility for public health for their areas, with larger ones being required to appoint a director of public health.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77b765152eca3e8ecdfdd92638bb843b4263bb2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77b765152eca3e8ecdfdd92638bb843b4263bb2c/0_200_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Andrew Lansley speaking with staff at Frimley Park hospital in 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Andrew Lansley speaking with staff at Frimley Park hospital in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey took a perfectly well-functioning public health system and fractured it,\u201d said Julie Hotchkiss, a PCT director with responsibility for emergency pandemic response who moved to York city council during the changes. She said it took her a year to work out where her infectious disease control nurses had gone. \u201cNo one knew and there was no one to ask.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Jeanelle de Gruchy, the president of the Association of Directors of Public Health, argues it was right for local authorities to have a key role in tackling health inequalities, which tend to relate to people\u2019s living circumstances and socio-economic status. She regards the transfer of public health to local authorities as \u201cincredibly important and positive\u201d. But she adds: \u201cIt\u2019s a very big job and the transition came at a time of cuts to the public sector, not just to local government, although those were huge.\u201d</p> <p>Lansley\u2019s act also created an entirely new agency that has been at the centre of the response to the coronavirus outbreak: Public Health England. It was given two primary responsibilities: improving health and reducing inequalities by tackling \u201clifestyle\u201d diseases, such as obesity; and protecting the public from infectious diseases and environmental hazards.</p> <p>The HPA, which had previously taken a lead on infectious disease control, was folded into PHE. Martin McKee, a professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, argues the result of all these new arrangements was \u201ca hugely weakened and fragmented public health system with consequences writ large in Covid-19\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=%C2%A3850m&amp;title=cut%20from%20the%20government%20public%20health%20grant%20to%20local%20authorities%20since%202015\" data-alt=\"\u00a3850m cut to public health grant since 2015\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&number=%C2%A3850m&title=cut%20from%20the%20government%20public%20health%20grant%20to%20local%20authorities%20since%202015\">\u00a3850m cut to public health grant since 2015</a> </figure>  <p>The DHSC rejected the suggestion that the system was fragmented and that changes had affected the government\u2019s ability to respond. Lord Lansley did too. He told the Guardian that an independent review of the public health changes from 2013 published by the <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/sites/default/files/2020-01/LGA%20PH%20reforms%20-%20final.pdf\">the King\u2019s Fund</a> thinktank in January, \u201cconcluded that they were the right reforms, but were not supported subsequently by the right level of resources\u201d. Combating health threats, such as pandemics, was \u201cno more or less fragmented\u201d after 2013, Lansley said, and the problem was not the new structures or moving public health to local government but money. \u201cOur intention was for a real-terms increase in public health budgets alongside those for the NHS, but this was not followed through from 2015 onwards,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The ringfenced annual grant for public health from central government to local authorities \u2013 currently about \u00a33.2bn \u2013 has been cut by a cumulative \u00a3850m in real terms since 2015-16, according to <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/sites/default/files/2020-01/LGA%20PH%20reforms%20-%20final.pdf\">the King\u2019s Fund</a> review.</p> <p>During his two-decade career in government, Scally had been involved in emergency responses for swine flu, foot and mouth, BSE, and the fuel crisis. For previous epidemics, he said, the government took \u201ca public health approach; go in quick and hard, test, trace, isolate, throw everything at it\u201d. But, he said, \u201cthe whole system was demolished\u201d by Lansley\u2019s changes, which led him to resign.</p> <p>He then worked as an adviser for Labour\u2019s former shadow health secretary, Andy Burnham, who is now the mayor of Greater Manchester. Burnham recalls Scally constantly warning him as Lansley\u2019s bill was going through parliament that \u201cwe were losing pandemic preparedness\u201d.</p> <h2>Testing time for Public Health England</h2> <p>No branch of government appears to have received more flak over its handling of the Covid-19 outbreak than Public Health England. The government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/england-coronavirus-testing-has-not-risen-fast-enough-science-chief\">suggested it had failed</a> to expand testing at the right moment. Its top executive has been criticised by leading public health experts, such as Prof Anthony Costello of University College London, for being \u201cinvisible\u201d.</p> <p>Even before the outbreak, the agency was a target of complaints from across the spectrum. Leftwing critics have accused PHE of failing to be tough enough in its role of promoting better health. The right has accused it of being the instrument of a nanny state with a bloated budget. PHE has had precious few political friends. But even those who might be natural allies \u2013 like Prof John Ashton, the former regional director of public health for north-west England \u2013 suggest it has \u201chad a bad Covid war\u201d.</p> <p>Some of this might be down to bad luck. Its chief executive, Duncan Selbie, caught the virus along with key advisers in Westminster, and its&nbsp;emeritus medical director and director for health protection&nbsp;until 2019, Prof Paul Cosford, has cancer and has been self-isolating, although both have been working throughout.</p> <p>However, there have also been structural challenges. The Lansley act created an agency that lacked independence from government, in contrast to its predecessor, the HPA. That has led to suspicions that some PHE decisions were politically influenced, such as the varying guidance on what kind of personal protective equipment (PPE) was needed for frontline staff treating Covid-19 patients. In late March, PHE said a lower specification of protective gowns than previously advised could be used, leading <a href=\"https://www.gmb.org.uk/news/trust-draining-away-over-dangerous-downgrade-ppe-guidance\">unions to accuse</a> it of basing decisions on shortages of PPE, rather than evidence. This month, it <a href=\"https://www.hsj.co.uk/coronavirus/mask-guidance-downgraded-amid-reports-of-failing-stock/7027562.article\">downgraded the type of masks</a> NHS workers should use \u201cas a pragmatic approach for times of severe shortage\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bafd3dcb8d86d9d955feb8409a33bcf41955efda\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bafd3dcb8d86d9d955feb8409a33bcf41955efda/0_413_6192_3715/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clinical staff wearing PPE as they care for a patient at the intensive care unit at Royal Papworth hospital in Cambridge.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clinical staff wearing PPE as they care for a patient at the intensive care unit at Royal Papworth hospital in Cambridge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>PHE disputes that it was slow off the mark, and Selbie points out that it rolled out the details for its first diagnostic test in January, making it \u201cthe fastest deployment of a novel test in recent UK history\u201d. It says the guidance on PPE has been misunderstood: it was offering a solution in the event of extreme shortages.</p> <p>\u201cOur track record speaks for itself,\u201d a PHE spokesperson said. \u201cDuring 2018-19 alone, we responded to more than 10,000 disease outbreaks and emergencies across England, including meningitis, measles, E coli and the first ever UK case of monkeypox.

The report only examined PHE and not the public health systems devolved to local authorities. The same report pointed out that \u201cthere is scope for greater clarity in the responsibilities of PHE\u2019s local partners\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=%C2%A040%25&amp;title=cut%20to%20PHE%27s%20operational%20budget%20in%20real%20terms%20since%202013\" data-alt=\"40% cut to PHE operational budget\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&number=%C2%A040%25&title=cut%20to%20PHE%27s%20operational%20budget%20in%20real%20terms%20since%202013\">40% cut to PHE operational budget</a> </figure>  <p>In its defence, PHE has had to absorb disparate functions since its creation in 2013. And it too has been struck by austerity: a public health source said PHE\u2019s operational budget sustained a 40% real-terms cut between 2013 and 2019.</p> <p>It was PHE that initially had responsibility for testing, tracing and advising isolation for those who became infected. It was a huge and complicated task, but one the World Health Organization has made clear from the outset was the single most important thing countries could do to suppress the disease. The government\u2019s decision to abandon large-scale testing and tracing on 12 March remains one of its most controversial decisions.</p> <p>PHE says it reprioritised limited resources rather than abandoning tracing completely. \u201cWhen the lockdown began, our contact-tracing resource was refocused on to complex outbreaks in care homes, prisons and immigration centres,\u201d Selbie said. \u201cThe good news is, now that we have testing capacity in place and are working towards recovery, we can start mass contact tracing through the NHS test and trace programme.</p> <p>\u201cPHE\u2019s contact tracing during the \u2018\u2018contain\u2019 phase of the pandemic bought several weeks of time for the government and the NHS to prepare for what was to come, and has undoubtedly saved lives,\u201d he said.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></p></li> </ul> <p>Greg Clark, the chair of the Commons science and technology select committee, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52716828\">accused</a> PHE of choosing to \u201cconcentrate\u201d tests in its own limited number of labs rather than expanding capacity rapidly by using university and private labs, as the Germans and South Koreans had done, even though the need for mass testing was \u201cidentifiable from the beginning\u201d. PHE responded by blaming the DHSC, saying it was responsible for decisions on testing policy.</p> <p>The DHSC spokesperson said: \u201cAlthough Britain had a world-class pharmaceutical industry, it did not have the existing diagnostic base necessary to test hundreds of thousands of people each week for a new virus.\u201d She said the government had more than doubled the capacity of NHS and PHE laboratories since early March, with more than 3m tests carried out by mid-May, and that anyone with symptoms could now book a test.</p> <p>The government boasts that its new Test and Trace programme will mobilise an \u201carmy\u201d of contact tracers. But in the two months leading up to 12 March, PHE\u2019s team resembled no more than a small platoon. The Guardian has established it consisted of just 70 staff in its field services, 120 in local health protection teams, and 20 specially recruited clinical staff. In total, the contact tracing operation to manage the pandemic consisted of just 210 people.</p> <p>Documents released on Friday by the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) suggest the contact-tracing operation initially only envisaged the need to deal with a handful of cases a week. Minutes from an 18 February meeting of the group said: \u201cCurrently PHE can cope with five new cases a week (requiring isolation of 800 contacts).\u201d The minutes added: \u201cModelling suggests this capacity could be increased to 50 new cases a week (8,000 contact isolations) but this assumption needs to be stress-tested with PHE operational colleagues.\u201d</p> <p>Rather than ramp\u2013up capacity, the government scientists instead agreed in the same meeting they would need data \u201cto feed into trigger points for decisions on when the current monitoring and contact-tracing approach is no longer working\u201d. The minutes added: \u201cWhen there is sustained transmission in the UK, contact tracing will no longer be useful.\u201d</p> <p>PHE said&nbsp;the reference to five cases a week was based on modelling of how it would cope with tracking the contacts of imported cases of Covid-19. In a statement, it added:&nbsp;\u201cPHE&nbsp;could deal with 5 new cases a week&nbsp;and the associated isolation of 800 contacts \u2013 which was sufficient capacity at the time \u2013 and&nbsp;modelling suggested it had the capacity to scale up significantly as needed.\u201d</p> <p>However, two days later, at another Sage meeting, the advisers acknowledged \u201cindividual cases could already have been missed\u201d and again discussed when it would be appropriate to abandon the nascent operation. Appearing to acknowledge such a move would be controversial, the minutes said: \u201cAny decision to discontinue contact tracing will generate a public reaction&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;which requires consideration with input from behavioural scientists.\u201d</p> <p>By the time community tracing was shelvedin mid\u2013March, PHE had \u201ccontact traced\u201d only 3,500 people who were likely to have been in close proximity with infected people on flights, cruises or other places where there were known outbreaks. Of those, only 3% tested positive for Covid-19 and were advised to self-isolate.</p> <p>In other words, PHE had managed to identify and warn about 100 people with Covid-19 who might otherwise have spread the disease \u2013 a tiny fraction of the infected people. Vallance said there were <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c9cf7d0-3d11-443e-a156-d111b333fd72\">5,000 confirmed</a> Covid cases when the community testing and tracing programme stopped, but epidemiologists at Imperial College London <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/18/sage-advice-britain-coronavirus-science-government-policy\">estimated</a> 1.8 million people in Britain were infected by the end of March.</p> <p>William Hanage, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Harvard University, said the numbers of PHE staff dedicated to contact tracing in Britain in the weeks leading up to mid-March was shocking. \u201cI am sure that the people involved in this programme worked incredibly hard, and I have the utmost respect for them, tasked with doing this in the face of a global pandemic,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it beggars belief to see these numbers held up as adequate.\u201d</p> <h2>The elusive 100,000 target</h2> <p>On 2 April, three weeks after capacity had been overwhelmed and PHE had abandoned testing in the community, Hancock <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/health-secretary-sets-out-plan-to-carry-out-100000-coronavirus-tests-a-day\">announced</a> a five-pillar testing plan. He pledged to scale up the country\u2019s testing capacity to reach a target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month.</p> <p>But the architecture created in the postwar years to respond to pandemics was no longer standing. In the past, the Public Health Laboratories Service had been tasked with disease control, and with coordinating support and advice to the NHS and others. In 2003, Labour folded it into the HPA. Fifty PHLS labs that existed two decades ago have been merged with hospital labs or \u201cconsolidated\u201d by successive governments to make efficiency savings. As of January this year, just eight laboratories remained under direct PHE control, along with <a href=\"https://improvement.nhs.uk/resources/pathology-networks/\">122 NHS labs</a> in England.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3d2ce9475aa9eb47dab9844d522a3a941cb52e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3d2ce9475aa9eb47dab9844d522a3a941cb52e6/0_49_3529_2118/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Hancock giving one of Downing Street\u2019s daily coronavirus press briefings.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matt Hancock giving one of Downing Street\u2019s daily coronavirus press briefings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pippa Fowles/10 Downing Street/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hancock expected hospital labs testing patients and staff and PHE to make up 25,000 of the ambitious 100,000 target. For the other 75,000 he turned to the private sector. Deloitte, one of the big four accountancy firms, was asked to set up a network of 50 drive-through rapid testing centres, and yet more private companies, such as Serco, Sodexo, Mitie and G4S, would operate and manage the day-to-day running of them.</p> <p>A lab network to process the tests was also established. Deloitte was again given the coordinating role in the creation of new Lighthouse labs in Milton Keynes, Glasgow, Belfast and Cheshire and a further facility in Cambridge, with day-to-day running entrusted to a coalition of private and public partners, including universities and drug companies.</p> <p>But Hancock\u2019s 2 April announcement made no mention of one of the main purposes of testing: tracking or tracing.</p> <p>The Guardian soon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/hospitals-sound-alarm-over-privately-run-test-centre-in-surrey\">received reports</a> from people trying to get tested of chaos at some sites, with results going astray, dangerously leaking swab samples arriving at labs, queues of more than three hours and symptomatic people being unable to book a test or told to make round trips of more than 100 miles to test centres. Many still report results taking seven to 10 days to arrive \u2013 too long to be useful for quarantine purposes \u2013 but the DHSC maintains that 97% of test results are obtained within 48 hours.</p> <p>In the last week of April, the government <a href=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/2425455/\">changed its criteria</a> for counting tests to include ones that had been dispatched, even if they had not been received, returned or processed. The date of 30 April came and Hancock missed his 100,000 target; the number of tests conducted that day was 81,611. But the next day, on 1 May, he appeared to smash it, as 122,347 tests were recorded in government data. The magic number had, by Hancock\u2019s own admission, included nearly 30,000 postal tests sent out but not yet analysed. By 3 May the number was back down to 76,496, and the government would fail to meet its target for the next seven days, before getting back on track on 11 May.</p> <p>For Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents foundation trusts in England, Hancock\u2019s single-minded focus on reaching an arbitrary number cost the country another precious month. \u201cToo much of April was wasted by focusing on the 100,000 tests by 30 April target at the expense of other aspects of a clear strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe testing strategy, if there was one, got hijacked on the basis of just meeting that target when there were lots of other things that needed to be done.\u201d</p> <p>Hopson said the saga also illustrates the danger of trying to control testing from the centre. \u201cWe need to be ready to do test, track and trace in every part of the country. That can only be done effectively with greater local control.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Twitter finally got something right. After a torrid week of acrimony, bluster and a president unleashing a flurry of tweets threatening violence and terrifying harassment on a mid-level Twitter employee, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/twitter-hides-donald-trump-tweet-glorifying-violence\">Twitter took a stand</a> on Thursday night that set the model for proper \u201ccontent moderation\u201d on its platform.</p> <p>After Donald Trump called for violence against American citizens \u2013something he has done multiple times before at his rallies and on Twitter \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/technology/trump-twitter-minneapolis-george-floyd.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">Twitter placed a cover over the dangerous tweet</a>, making people read the warning before reading it. Once people read the tweet, they could not \u201clike\u201d it or reply to it, thus slowing its flow through the system and muffling some of the madness.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/commentisfree/2020/may/28/donald-trump-twitter-ban-social-media-order\">Why Twitter should ban Donald Trump | Julia Carrie Wong</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Twitter ruled that the tweet \u201cviolated its rules about glorifying violence\u201d. This is the first time that Twitter has chosen to enforce its own rules when it came to the company\u2019s most famous and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-followed_Twitter_accounts\">eighth-most-followed account</a> (former president Barack Obama is first, much to Trump\u2019s frustration).</p> <p>Trump was reacting to the third night of anti-violence and anti-racist protests in Minneapolis, Minnesota. George Floyd, an African American man, died on Monday after a white police officer restrained Floyd by placing a knee on his neck for eight minutes while the dying man gasped, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d Bystanders told police, \u201cHe is human\u201d and \u201cCheck his pulse.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/us/minneapolis-police-man-died.html\">Four officers were fired and </a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/us/minneapolis-police-man-died.html\">one is currently facing criminal charges for Floyd\u2019s death</a>. But the record of local prosecutors in the United States holding their own police officers accountable is poor.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/george-floyd-minneapolis-protests.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage#link-ecd3f95\">Protests also broke out in at least nine other American cities</a>, reminding Americans that their law enforcement systems too often consider African Americans disposable and beneath concern for their basic safety and human rights.</p> <p>Trump, who <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/otilliasteadman/trump-charlottesville-defend-white-supremacists\">has consistently sided with violent white supremacists</a> and has overseen anti-immigration policies that would stem ethnic diversity in the United States, issued a stern threat to anti-racist protesters in the covered tweet.&nbsp;</p> <p>Once Twitter users encountered the cover, they could click \u201cView\u201d to read the message from the president: \u201c\u2026 when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!\u201d</p> <p>So Trump\u2019s expression stands, adding to the evidence that the most powerful nation in history is run by an unhinged, petulant whiner who wants nothing more than to make people forget that more than 100,000 Americans have died this year because of Covid-19 and more than 40 million have lost jobs.&nbsp;</p> <p>Importantly, by letting the message stand, Twitter has started a conversation, not stopped it. Trump and his followers will whine about \u201ccensorship\u201d but their concerns are unlikely to concern any but those deeply committed to Trump\u2019s cause, which is overwhelmingly an attempt to disrupt any attempt to think clearly about the damage he has done.&nbsp;</p> <p>Twitter had several options in this case. It could have deleted the offending tweets, but that would have raised interest in them and risked making the conversation about deletion rather than about Trump\u2019s calls for violence. Twitter could have removed Trump\u2019s account entirely for repeatedly violating rules against inciting violence and spreading misinformation about public health and voting rights. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/commentisfree/2020/may/28/donald-trump-twitter-ban-social-media-order\">And there are strong arguments for doing just that</a>, not least of which is the fact that Trump uses Twitter to distract people from the crucial issues of the moment and his own mismanagement of crises. Twitter still has that option if Trump continues to use Twitter to endanger innocent people \u2013 which he surely will.</p> <p>If Trump could not tweet, we might all be better able to focus. His eruptions would have to occur live, in front of reporters and viewers, so they could be contextualized and mitigated. But that\u2019s not in the immediate interest of Twitter. The blowback against Twitter and its innocent employees would be fierce and probably violent.</p> <p>Earlier in the week Twitter affixed a useless \u201cfact check\u201d tag to two of Trump\u2019s tweets about postal voting.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump essentially commanded his militia of supporters to flood the employee with death threats. That\u2019s exactly what happened</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This sent Trump into a rage. It spurred him to issue a silly \u201cexecutive order\u201d that demonstrated that no one in the White House seems to understand the very Twitter-shielding law Trump was criticising or the fact that the executive branch of government has no say over that law.&nbsp;</p> <p>While the \u201cexecutive order\u201d was harmless and comical, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21272210/trump-twitter-fact-check-admin-targeting-employee-voter-fraud-controversy\">Trump also unleashed a barrage of terror</a> on to an innocent employee of Twitter. After the New York Post and then Fox News revealed that this employee had participated in the decision to affix the \u201cfact check\u201d label to the tweets, Trump named him in a tweet. By doing so Trump essentially commanded his militia of supporters to flood the employee with death threats. That\u2019s exactly what happened.&nbsp;</p> <p>This sort of behavior has been a constant tactic of authoritarian nationalists like Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India. <a href=\"https://thewire.in/politics/narendra-modi-twitter-trolls-free-expression\">Modi\u2019s political supporters are known to flood</a> journalists and critics of the government with life-upending threats and even actual violence and murder. Modi uses Twitter, Facebook and WhatApp to execute his campaigns of terror. Trump has learned well from Modi. Despite all the pain they sparked for the Twitter employee, the \u201cfact checks\u201d did nothing to help anyone. No one is likely to click on the tiny link to read further information about postal voting. The fact that Trump reacted became the much bigger story, thus defeating the purpose of the \u201cfact check\u201d. It taught no one anything and did not impede the spread of misinformation.&nbsp;</p> <p>The later move, however, is much more effective and appropriate. The standard for such content moderation should be the potential for harm rather than the truth or falsity of the claims. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/02/opinion/facebook-zuckerberg-political-ads.html\">Determining the \u201ctruth\u201d of a tweet is folly.</a> Judging \u201ctruth\u201d itself is hardly something the staff at Twitter should or could do. \u201cTruth\u201d is not the real issue or the problem.</p> <p>Right now Twitter, Facebook and YouTube are leveraged to flood our collective consciousness with stimuli. The specific nature of the stimuli matters less than the overall experience of them. We are living in a cacophony of crap. When someone powerful wishes harm on others, the standard is easier to judge and much more urgent.&nbsp;</p> <p>Hours after Twitter covered Trump\u2019s tweet, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1266342941649506304?s=20\">the official White House account quoted the tweet in its entirety</a>, escaping Twitter\u2019s efforts. Twitter has done nothing to change how it presents the thousands of earlier dangerous tweets from Trump. And everything Trump tweets ends up on Facebook, which has seven times the number of American users that Twitter does. So this all could be futile anyway.</p> <p>There is no way Twitter can scale up this policy to cover every violent world leader, let alone the 330m Twitter accounts around the world. So we should not expect this practice to \u201cfix\u201d Twitter and make it a more useful and less destructive force in the world. People will still get hurt because Twitter remains fundamentally ungovernable. But slowing down Trump\u2019s calls for violence is the right move for Twitter. It just happens to be the right move for the rest of us as well.</p> <p>Companies should do what is best for themselves, their workers, customers, users and shareholders. There is no reason to expect companies to care about anything so vague and contradictory as the \u201cpublic interest\u201d. They have no incentive to do so. But a company like Twitter has a long-term interest in making the experience of Twitter as pleasant and untroubling as possible for users and advertisers. That\u2019s why content moderation matters.</p> <p>Twitter has never stood up for the interests of Twitter users over Trump before. It has bent to Trump\u2019s will time and time again. This move demonstrates that Twitter has learned a few things, albeit at least three years too late.&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li><p>Siva Vaidhyanathan is a regular columnist for the Guardian, a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia, and the author of Antisocial Media: How Facebook Disconnects Us and Undermines Democracy.</p></li> </ul>",

  "<p>Police&nbsp;across swathes of Africa&nbsp;have failed to find more than a fraction of&nbsp;hundreds of people who&nbsp;have escaped from often unsanitary and uncomfortable&nbsp;Covid-19 quarantine centres&nbsp;in recent weeks.</p> <p>There are more than 130,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Africa, but low levels of testing means the true total is likely to be much higher.</p> <p>In Malawi, more than 400 people repatriated from South Africa and elsewhere fled a makeshift centre set up at a stadium in Blantyre, the commercial capital, last week. Police and health workers told reporters they were unable to stop the escapees as they lacked adequate protective gear.</p> <p>At least 46 escapees had tested positive for the virus, officials said. Some of those who fled told reporters they had bribed police. In separate incidents 26 people left the Mwanza border post while waiting for test results and eight others, all tested and shown to be infected, broke out of an isolation centre in Blantyre.</p> <p>In Zimbabwe, Paul Nyathi,&nbsp;a police spokesman, said a total of 148 people had escaped from centres where a 21-day quarantine is mandatory for those returning from abroad.</p> <p>&nbsp;\u201cSecurity has been beefed up at the quarantine centres and measures are being taken to repair porous dura walls and security fences at some of the facilities,\u201d Nyathi said.</p> <p>There has also been at least one mass breakout in Kenya, while individuals have also escaped from quarantine in&nbsp;Gambia, Ghana, Nigeria, <a href=\"https://www.nation.co.ke/news/africa/Truck-drivers-with-Covid-19-escape/1066-5563964-rfy9ydz/index.html\">Uganda&nbsp;</a>and <a href=\"https://allafrica.com/stories/202005250631.html\">Namibia</a>.</p> <p>Zimbabwe\u2019s information minister, Monica Mutsvangwa, told reporters earlier this month that the government is increasing security at the schools, colleges and hotels used as quarantine centres. Government spokesman Nick Mangwana suggested that security officers guarding centres with high walls and razor wire might be receiving bribes to allow people to leave early.</p> <p>Nearly all of Zimbabwe\u2019s 75 new coronavirus cases last week came from centres that hold hundreds of people who have returned, sometimes involuntarily, from neighbouring South Africa and Botswana.&nbsp;</p> <p>There have been widespread complaints about conditions in the quarantine centres, but the president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, said the returnees should not expect luxury.</p> <p>\u201cWe can try to provide for them, but we cannot provide five-star facilities like hotels,\u201d Mnangagwa said on Thursday.</p> <p>Norman Matara, secretary general of the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association, told the Guardian it was impossible to observe social distancing in the centres, which posed a significant risk to those held in them and to the country as a whole.</p> <p>\u201cIt is disturbing. It may show that people are being infected in quarantine centres. So people should not share things like amenities and do not eat in overcrowded dining rooms,\u201d Matara said.&nbsp;</p> <p>South Africa,&nbsp;a developed economy&nbsp;which attracts migrant workers from across the region,&nbsp;has more than 27,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 \u2013&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-05-01/south-africa-eases-one-of-worlds-strictest-lockdowns\">the most in Africa</a>.&nbsp;There are fears that the outbreak there could spread across southern Africa, where health systems are considerably less able to cope.</p> <p>Zimbabwe\u2019s government is also worried about people crossing porous borders illegally. The information ministry has set up a hotline number and is asking people to stop harbouring \u201cborder jumpers\u201d and those who \u201cabscond\u201d from quarantine.</p> <p>The busy border with South Africa was shut in March but there are close to 200 illegal crossing points used by traffickers to obtain basic goods that are unavailable or unaffordable in Zimbabwe.</p> <p>Earlier this month,&nbsp;41 Malawian immigrants were picked up by police after skipping the border from South Africa through the Limpopo River. Nine are being kept at&nbsp;a&nbsp;quarantine centre&nbsp;at the&nbsp;Beitbridge&nbsp;border point&nbsp;after they tested positive for&nbsp;Covid-19.&nbsp;</p> <p>Sean Muguti, a freight clearing agent at Beitbridge, said smugglers were working with truckers: \u201cIt is a&nbsp;battle for&nbsp;survival \u2026&nbsp;They will always find ways to beat the system.\u201d</p> <p>South Africa has been able to provide relatively comfortable quarantine facilities when necessary, hosting one group of nationals returning from China in a tourist lodge in the province of Limpopo.</p> <p>But elsewhere centres are often unsanitary, uncomfortable and in some cases dangerous, human rights campaigners say.</p> <p>In&nbsp;Kenya, <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/05/28/kenya-quarantine-conditions-undermine-rights\">investigations by Human Rights Watch</a>&nbsp;revealed&nbsp;poor conditions, including lack of bedding, water, food, and cleaning supplies.&nbsp;People held in quarantine facilities told HRW&nbsp;they were not told of test results and that staff did not wear protective equipment.</p> <p>A 22-year-old man who was quarantined following his arrival from France on 23 March told the organisation that his centre had lacked electricity, bathing water, food and water to drink.</p> <p>\u201cThe beds had no mattresses or beddings. I slept on the spring bed with no mattress and nothing to cover myself. They told me I had to pay for water,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Many others&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-52326316\">described similar conditions</a>&nbsp;in other facilities and said the authorities sometimes extended quarantine periods from the initial mandatory 14 days to more than 30 days, even when people tested negative several times.</p> <p>All were asked to pay for accommodation, food and other costs before being allowed to leave. Many of those who could not pay were held for additional days and in one instance police were called in to beat those who persisted in pleading their inability to pay, victims and witnesses said.</p>",
  "<p>What next in Beijing\u2019s master plan for China\u2019s global advancement? Anyone looking for details would have struggled to find them last week at the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UME5egprg\">press conference</a> held by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/li-keqiang\">Li Keqiang</a>, with the Chinese premier much more focused on the ruling party\u2019s perils on the home front.&nbsp;</p> <p>The \u201cwolf warrior\u201d diplomacy, the world of blustering threats that Beijing has been using to bend countries to its bidding, was absent. Instead Li\u2019s focus in the 90-minute event was much more that of a nerdy economic policymaker. In the kind of minute detail redolent of the boss of a small provincial city, the premier listed an array of support measures for the economy: tax cuts for small business, reforms to medical and unemployment insurance, and support for the gig economy.</p> <p>The reason for Li\u2019s focus was obvious. China might have been the first major country out of (as it was the first into) the Covid-19 crisis, but its economy suffered a brutal contraction along the way, leaving a jobless rate of about 20%.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d3a49c64ab6a9b5eae5f68346556d9f20e28287\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d3a49c64ab6a9b5eae5f68346556d9f20e28287/424_245_4387_2633/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Li Keqiang gives a video press conference\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Li Keqiang gives a video press conference after the closing of the third session of the 13th National People\u2019s Congress on 28 May 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: China News Service/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The premier\u2019s annual press conference, held at the end of the annual session of the National People\u2019s Congress, China\u2019s legislature \u2013 delayed by nearly three months because of the virus \u2013 is a keenly watched event, at home and abroad. There were no questions on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/uighurs\">Uighurs</a> or re-education camps in Xinjiang, China\u2019s recent border clashes with India, its trade war with Australia or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/27/huawei-meng-wanzhou-canada-court-ruling-us-extradition\">detention of a Huawei executive in Canada</a>, issues the government didn\u2019t want to air. Likewise, the queries on the economy, the origins of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/10-days-battle-wuhan-covid-19-testing-plan\">Covid-19 in Wuhan</a>, deteriorating relations with Washington, and the new Hong Kong security law were all softballs for Li, who is effectively Xi Jinping\u2019s deputy.&nbsp;</p> <p>But even if <a href=\"https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/zxxx_662805/t1783859.shtml\">the questions </a>from foreign and local reporters are cleared by the government beforehand, it is still the only moment in each calendar year in which a top leader appears at length in public and has to state the government\u2019s case. The focus on the economy, then, was telling. For a ruling party that has built legitimacy on near continuous high-speed growth since the late 1970s, the current downturn is a bracing moment. Tens and perhaps hundreds of millions have lost jobs. Those still in employment have had incomes sharply reduced, cutting into consumption. With the US, Europe and Japan in deep recessions, exports cannot take up the slack.</p> <p>To be sure, Beijing has not let its regional and global ambitions lie fallow during Covid-19 and its aftermath, with navy patrols in the South China Sea and the airforce sorties around Taiwan both continuing. And in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/hong-kong\">Hong Kong</a>, the most volatile issue on China\u2019s plate, the city\u2019s democrats have been placed firmly in the party\u2019s sights.</p> <p>With the passage of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/china-vote-npc-national-security-laws-hong-kong-us-protest\">a new national security law</a> by the NPC last week, China is making a big bet that it can stamp out its political opponents in the former British colony without killing off its vital role as a financial centre. The bill\u2019s vaguely worded offences, outlawing subversion, secessionist sentiment and foreign interference, will be interpreted widely, as they are in China itself, to round up any critics Beijing wants to target.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b59b4b860fa111ad3a64b9a3c80a4349227d6e75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b59b4b860fa111ad3a64b9a3c80a4349227d6e75/752_36_2248_2810/800.jpg\" alt=\"A demonstrator holds up a British national (overseas) passport in front of a Hong Kong colonial flag in shopping mall\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protester holds up a British national (overseas) passport in front of a Hong Kong colonial flag in a shopping mall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kin Cheung/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/uk-will-extend-visas-for-300000-hong-kong-residents-says-raab\">The UK\u2019s suggestion</a> that it would offer a path to citizenship for Hong Kong holders of British national (overseas) passports wanting to leave the territory prompted a sardonic thumbs-up in Beijing. \u201cThe potential UK move has won overwhelming support from Chinese internet users,\u201d said the <em>Global Times</em>, the party\u2019s tabloid attack dog. \u201c[They] said all traitors should be sent to the UK as they are unwanted on Chinese territory.\u201d</p> <p>But no one in Hong Kong thinks the fight will be over quickly, especially as Beijing\u2019s plan for its takeover of the territory\u2019s political system, and opposition to it, is so comprehensive.</p> <p>\u201cThey will send down cadres from the Chinese Communist party to supervise the government, the executive, the legislature, and more importantly, the judiciary. This is only the beginning, I tell you,\u201d Martin Lee, the barrister and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/24/i-wont-allow-this-to-be-the-end-of-hong-kong-campaigner-on-his-long-fight-for-democracy\">veteran democrat leader</a> said on Friday.</p> <p>In his press conference, Li offered only platitudes on the US relationship but said enough to confirm that bilateral ties between the two superpowers, one rising, the other in relative decline, will not get better soon. There is no off ramp for the US and China for the moment, as it is clear that neither country is looking for one. Washington feels it is playing catch up in muscling up to Beijing, a debate that will only be sharpened in a presidential election year. And China under Xi is programmed not to take a backward step.</p> <p>It is possible that the weakness in both countries\u2019 economies could temper their hardline positions this year, because neither wants to hurt growth any more than it has been already by Covid-19. Equally, Donald Trump might slap new sanctions on China at any time in a heated election campaign, to reinforce his narrative that he has been uniquely tough on China and that Joe Biden, his expected Democratic challenger, by comparison, will be weak. Beijing has made sure to retaliate against any economic sanctions imposed by Trump so far. It is an open question as to whether their calculation will change in an election year.</p> <p>One standout from Li\u2019s appearance before the media was his focus on the importance of the private sector to China\u2019s economic recovery. Xi\u2019s support for the state sector, and his lip service to the private economy, which drives Chinese growth and employment, has alienated many of the country\u2019s entrepreneurs. A number of wealthy business leaders who crossed Xi have been jailed. But Li, who has been overshadowed in office by Xi, took a different line, though whether support for the private sector can be sustained in a grim political climate, however, remains to be seen. Xi will not tolerate any rivals, especially in the form of rich entrepreneurs.</p> <p>\u2022 Richard McGregor is a senior fellow at the Lowy Institute in Sydney and is the author of numerous books on Chinese politics and foreign policy</p>",

In Afghanistan, conflict has raged on and off since the Soviet invasion in 1979.

In Israel-Palestine, war \u2013 or rather the absence of peace \u2013 has characterised life since 1948. Somalis have endured 40 years of fighting. These are but a few examples in a world where the idea of war without end seems to have become accepted, even normalised.</p> <p>Why do present-day politicians, generals, governments and international organisations appear incapable or uninterested in making peace? In the 19th and 20th centuries, broadly speaking, wars commenced and concluded with formal ultimatums, declarations, agreed protocols, truces, armistices and treaties.</p> <p>Neat and tidy endings, even if sometimes illusory, are rarer these days. According to a survey <a href=\"https://www.iiss.org/press/2020/acs-2020\">published last week</a> by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, 60% of armed conflicts have been active for at least a decade and peace-making prospects globally are in decline.</p> <p>Today\u2019s wars are mostly undeclared, undefined and inglorious affairs typically involving multiple parties, foreign governments, proxy forces, covert methods and novel weapons. They are conducted without regard for civilian lives, the <a href=\"https://www.icrc.org/en/war-and-law/treaties-customary-law/geneva-conventions\">Geneva conventions</a> regulating armed conflict, or the interests of host populations in whose name they are fought.</p> <p>Great moral crusades, famous causes and genuine ideological struggles are few and far between. Modern wars are mostly about power and treasure. And they go on, and on, and on.</p> <p>Libya is a classic case of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/from-idlib-to-tripoli-turkeys-grab-for-influence-in-libya\">a state of chaos</a> deliberately fed and manipulated by external powers, in this instance Turkey, Qatar, Russia, Egypt and the UAE. Here, as elsewhere, rival rulers claim to be upholding order or fighting \u201cterrorism\u201d while, in reality, they seek to extend national influence and economic advantage. As long as these aims remain unmet, they show scant interest in peace.</p> <p>Ambitious states have always sought to dominate neighbours in the way China, for example, is doing now. One reason this happens more frequently today, and more anarchically, is declining American engagement.</p> <p>In the Middle East and Africa, the US \u2013 no longer a global policeman \u2013 is focused on supporting Israel, squeezing Iran and selling arms, to the exclusion of almost all else. In Asia, it is in retreat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902ongRW5pELIXK/\" data-alt=\"countries with perpetual conflicts\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902ongRW5pELIXK/\">countries with perpetual conflicts</a> </figure>  <p>Donald Trump, desperate for a Nobel peace prize, offered to mediate the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2018/jun/12/trump-and-kim-document-analysis-singapore-agreement-denuclearisation\"> 70-year-old North Korea-South Korea stand-off</a>.

Few take him seriously. Otherwise, his administration has shown zero interest in global conflict resolution.</p> <p>A related factor is the collapse of the western-led consensus favouring multilateral, collaborative approaches to international problems. This is matched by the parallel rise of authoritarian and populist regimes that prioritise narrow national interest over perceptions of the common good.</p> <p>This trend, a regression to the pre-1914 era of competing European nation-states, undermines <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/24/the-observer-view-on-the-failure-to-secure-a-global-ceasefire-during-the-pandemic\">the authority of the UN</a> and cooperative regional platforms such as the EU and African Union. Unsupported, UN peace envoys from Syria to Myanmar and peacekeeping operations across Africa struggle to make headway.</p> <p>Ineffective international law enforcement, symbolised by the inability of the International Criminal Court to deliver justice to war zones such as Iraq and Ukraine, helps freeze or perpetuate conflicts rather than justly resolve them. Demographic and physical causes also contribute to chronic instability.</p> <p>Conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Sahel and Sudan is fuelled by the fact that millions of young men in Africa, where the <a href=\"https://mo.ibrahim.foundation/news/2019/africas-first-challenge-youth-bulge-stuck-waithood\">median age is 19.8</a>, lack fulfilling work or a meaningful stake in their country\u2019s future. Long-running inter-state or intra-state violence is also rooted in the climate crisis and resulting resource scarcity, poverty and dislocation.</p> <p>New technologies and weapons such as drones and cyber warfare are lowering the up-front cost of conflict while enlarging potential theatres of war. Global warming is turning the newly accessible Arctic into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/24/trump-greenland-gambit-sad-sign-arctic-up-for-grabs\">a vast, pristine battleground</a>. Outer space presents infinite possibilities for violence.<br><br>Religious wars are often the most bitterly fought and hardest to halt. As in the past, multiple collisions of faith, culture and values between Christians, Jews, Muslims, Hindus and other belief systems are key elements in the early 21st century\u2019s insatiable addiction to war.</p> <p>The Muslim world is also divided internally, between the Shia and Sunni traditions and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/24/islamic-state-is-back-and-this-time-the-west-is-ill-prepared-to-take-it-on\">fundamentalist</a> and secular interpretations of Islam.

It quickly turned into full-scale war as Assad\u2019s regional foes, notably Saudi Arabia, seized a chance to overthrow a regime allied with Iran. Since then upwards of<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Syrian_Civil_War\"> half a million people </a>are estimated to have died. </p> <p>The US and Europe also sought to install a friendly, pro-western government in Damascus. As Assad\u2019s grip on power weakened, Russia, supported by Iran, intervened in 2015 to stave off collapse and thwart western ambitions. Other interventions came from Turkey and from Islamic State jihadists, who declared a caliphate in Syria and Iraq.</p> <p>The war continues in the north-western province of Idlib, the last rebel-held stronghold, to which millions have fled. A current ceasefire is not expected to last. There are also fears that up to 100,000 people could die there if Covid-19 spreads in crowded refugee camps.

  "<p>Director Andrew Patterson works low-budget wonders in his audacious feature debut, a 50s-set oddity that won the audience prize at last year\u2019s Slamdance festival and was recently programmed for some socially distanced drive-in screenings in the US, doubtless adding a fittingly retro feel. Paying homage to a bygone era of television serials and sci-fi B-movies, the eerie night-time action\u2013 which plays out in close to real time \u2013 is lent a cutting-edge modernity by carefully choreographed kinetic camerawork that takes the breath away. Yet for all its sinewy visual panache, this theatrically wordy drama (from a screenplay by James Montague and Craig W Sanger) is at heart a radio play with pictures, pitched somewhere between Orson Welles\u2019s infamous&nbsp;<em>The War of the Worlds</em>&nbsp;broadcast of the 30s, and the Wolfman Jack backdrop to George Lucas\u2019s nostalgic 60s throwback masterpiece&nbsp;<em>American Graffiti.</em></p> <p>It\u2019s basketball night in the small New Mexico town of Cayuga, which like the rest of the US is gripped with tales of Soviet infiltration and extraterrestrial visitation. Fast-talking, savvy teen Everett (Jake Horowitz) is helping to set up the game\u2019s recording equipment before heading over to local station WOTW (note the HG Wellsian initials) to present his radio show. Alongside him is Fay (Sierra McCormick), a bespectacled science enthusiast who works at the telephone exchange and is eager to experiment with her newly acquired reel-to-reel recorder. At their respective places of work, both hear a strange thrumming noise that seems to break through the ether into the airwaves. Meanwhile, reports of \u201csomething in the skies\u201d coincide with mysterious calls offering bizarre explanations for the disturbances. Is Cayuga the subject of a foreign invasion? What have the US government been hiding all these years? And are our young heroes on the brink of a close encounter?</p> <p>Framed as an episode of a TV show called Paradox Theater, a Rod&nbsp;Serling-style black-and-white series that invites viewers to enter \u201ca realm between clandestine and forgotten\u201d,&nbsp;<em>The Vast of Night&nbsp;</em>is filled with alienating devices that seem designed to keep the audience at a distance. Indeed the breathless opening sequence, in which the cinematographer Miguel I Littin-Menz\u2019s camera chases our protagonists through halls, car parks and streets, occasionally threatens to lose us altogether&nbsp;\u2013 leaving us running to catch up with Everett and Fay, struggling to comprehend their rapid-fire conversation. Later, an audacious extended shot (the creation of which recalls the DIY inventiveness of Sam Raimi\u2019s&nbsp;<em>The Evil Dead</em>) takes us all the way across town, brilliantly establishing the geography of this drama while simultaneously dazzling us with the sheer head-spinning logistics of its trajectory.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEiwpCJqMM0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZEiwpCJqMM0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEiwpCJqMM0\">Watch a trailer for The Vast of Night.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Yet it\u2019s in the moments that the camera comes to a halt, or the film appears to close its eyes (Patterson isn\u2019t afraid of blackouts), that&nbsp;<em>The Vast of Night</em>&nbsp;casts its most mesmerising spell. Whether it\u2019s Fay holding multiple conversations while operating the patch-board of the telephone exchange, or the enigmatic Mabel Blanche (Gale Cronauer \u2013 terrific) recounting her own story-within-the-story, Patterson and his talented crew know when to run, and when to just sit still.</p> <p>Citing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/12/71-review-muscular-moody-belfast-thriller\">Yann Demange\u2019s underrated Belfast thriller&nbsp;</a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/12/71-review-muscular-moody-belfast-thriller\">\u201971</a></em>&nbsp;as an immersive inspiration (alongside Gaspar No\u00e9\u2019s&nbsp;<em>Irr\u00e9versible</em>)<em>, </em>Patterson litters this increasingly dizzying mystery with playful nods to classic sci-fi chillers like Don Siegel\u2019s 1956&nbsp;<em>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</em>. Yet as with so many of its genre predecessors, beneath the surface lurks a socioeconomic subtext. It\u2019s significant that the only people who seem to know what\u2019s really going on in Cayuga are exactly the type that no one in this small-town world takes seriously: belittled women, African American men, callers to a late-night radio talkshow. And while ultra-confident Everett may be the man of the moment, achieving the velocity needed to escape his roots, it\u2019s Fay who is clearly the smartest character on screen, although she dismisses the suggestion that she too could break free, clearly aware that opportunities are not equal.</p> <p>At times, as key characters attempt to tune in to baffling recorded noises, I was reminded of Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s&nbsp;<em>The Conversation</em>, a masterful exercise in overheard anxiety and projected paranoia. Like that film,&nbsp;<em>The Vast of Night</em>&nbsp;(which boasts inventive music and sound design) wants its audience to lean forward in their seats; to look that little bit deeper, listen just a little more closely. That a film with such an apparently familiar narrative can keep us this intrigued is a credit to the film-makers \u2013 particularly Patterson, from whom we should expect to hear much more in the future.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Vast-Night-Sierra-McCormick/dp/B084JFRR62\">The Vast of Night is on Amazon Prime</a></p></li> </ul>",

He uses the platform to threaten war, hire and fire staff, goad perceived foes and stoke partisan divisions. Twitter, which did not exist 15 years ago, has become one of the most famous companies in the world, the new first draft of presidential history.</p> <p>But now the relationship is on the rocks.</p> <p>For the first time, Twitter this week added a factchecking tag to two of Trump\u2019s tweets when he made unsubstantiated claims of fraud in mail-in voting. The president struck back on Thursday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/donald-trump-social-media-executive-order-twitter\">with an executive order</a> threatening social media companies with new free speech regulations.</p> <p>Asked if he had considered deleting his account, Trump replied: \u201cIf we had a fair press in this country, I would do that in a heartbeat. There\u2019s nothing I\u2019d rather do than get rid of my whole Twitter account.\u201d</p> <p>A day later, in another first, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/twitter-hides-donald-trump-tweet-glorifying-violence\">Twitter hid a tweet</a> by Trump behind a warning accusing him of breaking its rules by \u201cglorifying violence\u201d in a message that said looters at protests in Minneapolis would be shot. The president lashed out again in \u2013 naturally \u2013 a tweet, complaining: \u201cTwitter is doing nothing about all of the lies and propaganda being put out by China or the Radical Left Democrat Party. They have targeted Republicans, Conservatives &amp; the President of the United States.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"47a4965b02afa7b597e7ebadaa09d942a42ab76a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47a4965b02afa7b597e7ebadaa09d942a42ab76a/1674_0_2230_2788/800.jpg\" alt=\"Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fran\u00e7ois Mori/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Facebook did not remove Trump\u2019s same post from its site, with its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10111961824369871\">putting clear daylight</a> between his approach, which exempts politicians from a third-party factchecking program, and that of his Twitter counterpart, Jack Dorsey. As for Trump, whose election owed much to social media, he now appears to be biting the hand that feeds him.</p> <p>\u201cI think the last thing Trump wants is to shut down Facebook, YouTube and Twitter,\u201d said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Moonalice?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Roger McNamee,</a> author of Zucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe. \u201cHe\u2019s completely dependent on them and, by the way, they on him. The symbiosis is complete.</p> <p>\u201cNow, I think what Twitter did relative to the looters and shooters tweet is actually very brave. It\u2019s also incredibly obvious and something they should\u2019ve done years ago, and something Facebook should do, because if you look at the public safety aspect of the terms of service, that tweet is an obvious violation and, coming from the president, it has enormous risk of causing public safety harm.\u201d</p> <p>McNamee, a co-founder of the private equity firm <a href=\"https://elevation.com/\">Elevation Partners</a> and an early investor in Facebook, Google and Amazon, added: \u201cThe fact that Facebook left it up speaks volumes about the different approaches of the two companies because how big do you think Twitter is without Trump? Is it half its current size? Is it less than that? This is a very brave thing for them to do.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s use of Twitter offers <a href=\"https://www.thefortyfifth.us/\">a real-time window on his consciousness</a> at all hours of day and night. Some of his posts are vivid reactions to items he has seen on the Fox News network. Others hurl insults at political foes and the media or traffic in incendiary racism. In the past month they have reached a crescendo of abuse, demagoguery and conspiracy theories, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/26/lori-klausutis-husband-asks-twitter-delete-trump-joe-scarborough-smears-death\">a baseless accusation of murder</a> levelled at a TV host.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SykesCharlie?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Charlie Sykes,</a> a conservative author and broadcaster, said: \u201cHis Twitter account has been central to his presidency and he\u2019s obviously obsessed with it. That\u2019s what makes this so strange: if he were to shut down Twitter, he obviously would deprive himself of a platform. If he succeeds in having the law changed, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/us/politics/trump-jack-dorsey.html\">it would backfire on him</a> because it would then make the social media platforms liable for his lies and his slanders.\u201d</p> <p>Like a much-hyped executive order in April that threatened to ban immigration, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/apr/21/trump-us-immigration-ban-pause-green-cards\">turned out to have numerous exceptions,</a> the bark of Thursday\u2019s executive order is likely to be worse than its bite.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24460b80e751f78cb1e4d4ce47b44f337e52cc49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24460b80e751f78cb1e4d4ce47b44f337e52cc49/0_0_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump used the New York tabloids to similar trolling effect before Twitter and Facebook came along.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump used the New York tabloids to similar trolling effect before Twitter and Facebook came along.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It attacks legal protections that shield social media companies from liability for users\u2019 content, but a change in the law would require an act of Congress. Observers detected a blatant attempt to deflect attention from Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which this week claimed its 100,000th life in America, and an outbreak of violence after the police killing of a black man in Minneapolis.</p> <p>Sykes, THE founder and editor-at-large of <a href=\"https://thebulwark.com/\">the Bulwark website,</a> added: \u201cTo be attacking a private company because it factchecked him is a disturbing look, even for Trump. The willingness to use the full weight of federal government to go in and punish a private company for factchecking one of his tweets.</p> <p>\u201cTwitter did not censor his tweet. It answered his tweet with a factcheck. In other words, it answered speech with more speech, which is the way the first amendment is supposed to work.\u201d</p> <p>Trump expressed anger last year after <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/04/tech/trump-social-media-twitter-facebook/index.html\">Facebook banned seven users</a> including the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, rightwing media stars Milo Yiannopoulos and Laura Loomer, and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, notorious for using antisemitic language. He and fellow conservatives have long claimed without evidence that Silicon Valley tech companies are biased against them.</p> <p>Twitter first announced in early 2018 that it would not block world leaders or remove their controversial tweets, though it subsequently announced that it could apply warning labels and obscure the tweets of world leaders if they used their accounts to threaten or abuse others. Despite this week\u2019s skirmishes, the prospect of the US president being banned still seems remote.</p> <p>Sykes commented: \u201cI think that\u2019s unlikely to happen. Banning Trump allows him to play the victim card and say, \u2018Look, I am the president and they won\u2019t let me speak\u2019. So it makes him a martyr. It\u2019s probably better to factcheck him. On the other hand, that\u2019s going to be extremely difficult. Are they going to factcheck every one of his tweets?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"200c345ae4c06bfd0195b085370db610cad79bd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/200c345ae4c06bfd0195b085370db610cad79bd7/0_175_4500_2699/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter page is displayed on a mobile phone on Thursday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter page is displayed on a mobile phone on Thursday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olivier Douliery/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cDoes that mean they\u2019re going to be under tremendous pressure to factcheck everyone else? There\u2019s a danger for Twitter that he will drag them down the rabbit hole, that he will make their factchecking of him into another massive distraction issue.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has put Twitter front and centre in public life but he is not its most followed personality. To his probable chagrin, THE No 1 spot is held by Obama with 118 million, <a href=\"https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/most-twitter-followers/\">according to Brandwatch,</a> ahead of singers Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, Rihanna, Taylor Swift, footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, singer Lady Gaga and TV personality Ellen DeGeneres. Then comes Trump in ninth place.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/rickwtyler?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Rick Tyler,</a> a political analyst, said: \u201cHe [Trump] needs Twitter because it\u2019s his vehicle to communicate with millions of people who follow him. I\u2019m not sure Twitter needs him and, if it does need him, then it\u2019s a flawed business model because Trump one day won\u2019t be with us. He\u2019s an old man and so if Twitter\u2019s business model depends on Donald Trump, it\u2019s a very short-lived business model.\u201d</p> <p>The president\u2019s threat to terminate his love-hate relationship with social media rings somewhat hollow. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/profiles/michael-dantonio\">Biographer Michael D\u2019Antonio</a> describes him as \u201ca troll at heart\u201d who used the New York tabloids to similar effect before Twitter and Facebook came along. He said of the current feud: \u201cI think it\u2019s about Twitter being his drug and Jack Dorsey threatening to limit his supply.</p> <p>\u201cIt has the effect of a drug on him, so the pleasure that he gets from tweeting and from the response to his tweet probably gives him a rush and I think even the thought of it being constrained is painful, probably physically painful in his own body.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s also him encountering someone who can hold him responsible and, as he makes clear, he\u2019s never responsible for anything, and that is enraging. It\u2019s like the kid who\u2019s been let loose in a candy store and suddenly an adult says, \u2018Well, that\u2019s all done now, it\u2019s time for you to leave,\u2019 and he doesn\u2019t want to leave so he\u2019s having a tantrum.\u201d</p>",

The wife is still working but her income is less than their rent. \u201cThey have leave to remain in the UK but no recourse to public funds, so they can\u2019t get any help at all,\u201d Timms said.</p> <p>\u201cHang on Stephen,\u201d the PM responded, \u201cwhy aren\u2019t they eligible for universal credit or employment support allowance or any of the other benefits?\u201d</p> <p>Because they have no recourse to public funds, a condition imposed on virtually all immigrants from outside the European Economic Area who do not have indefinite leave to remain here. They may have been working and paying taxes in Britain for years but they are ineligible for most benefits. The Home Office refuses to disclose figures but the Children\u2019s Society estimates that a million adults and 142,000 children may be affected. The policy, introduced by Labour in 1999, is one of the most pitiless immigration rules and has caused particular hardship now.</p> <p>And yet the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/29/boris-johnson-baffled-britain-migration-laws\">prime minister seems not to know that it even exists</a>.</p> <p>It illuminates the nature of much of the immigration debate. Laws are passed as much for the optics as for the reality. Politicians often don\u2019t know the consequences of those laws, or even that they exist. The ignorance is as shocking as the rules are cruel.</p> <p>\u2022Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist</p>",
  "<p>The Church of England has reinstated a Rwandan bishop who left his role<strong> </strong>as a parish priest in Worcestershire after he was accused of complicity in the 1994 genocide of hundreds of thousands of Tutsis.</p> <p>The Right Rev Jonathan Ruhumuliza, 64, left his position in the village of Hampton Lovett six years ago after the <em>Observer</em> reported that he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/15/rwanda-genocide-priest-accomplice-in-england\">accused by human rights groups</a> of acting as a public apologist for the genocidal government, and of being complicit in the atrocities.

After the genocide, he was made bishop of Kigali.</p> <p>Ruhumuliza has previously denied accusations of complicity in the atrocities, endangering Tutsis and any involvement with distributing or requesting weapons.</p> <p>But in 1996, he apologised for failing to \u201cenergetically condemn either the tragedy which was in progress or the state communiqu\u00e9s which were broadcast on the radios during this time\u201d.</p> <p>He said he should have \u201cpublicly condemn[ed] the genocide\u201d.</p> <p>However, he continued to face criticism within the Anglican church in Rwanda from those who said his apology failed to address his defence of the government. In 1997, he moved to Canada and was later appointed bishop of Cameroon.</p> <p>A year after Ruhumuliza arrived in Britain, he was appointed honorary assistant bishop in the diocese of Worcester and a priest at St Mary and All Saints church in Hampton Lovett, Worcestershire.</p> <p>The Church of England said it had conducted extensive checks and found no evidence of complicity in genocide. It said the bishop had been commended to the C of E by the then archbishop of Rwanda, Emmanuel Kolini.</p> <p>However, Kolini told the <em>Observer</em> that he had warned the Church of England that the church in Rwanda had not investigated the bishop\u2019s conduct, and said he had no knowledge of the \u201cextensive checks\u201d by Lambeth Palace.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5be142dcc20f939de1b2c92eb19bb466c871d01\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5be142dcc20f939de1b2c92eb19bb466c871d01/18_124_1835_1100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tens of thousands of Rwandan refugee\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tens of thousands of Rwandan refugees forced to go back to their country in 1996, despite fears they will be killed upon their return.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jean-Marc Bouju/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2011, the Home Office refused Ruhumuliza political asylum, claiming he was implicated in crimes against humanity and was a \u201cgenocide-denier\u201d.</p> <p>Three years later, Theresa May, then home secretary, again rejected Ruhumuliza\u2019s asylum application. That decision was overturned by an immigration tribunal on the grounds that, even if he was implicated in crimes against humanity, the priest had found redemption through his religious work since the genocide.</p> <p>The appeal court upheld the tribunal decision in 2018. In a <a href=\"http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2018/1178.htm\">dissenting opinion</a>, Lord Justice Singh said that the tribunal should have considered evidence as to whether Ruhumuliza was responsible for crimes against humanity and not solely decided whether he was entitled to asylum on the basis of his repentance.</p> <p>Last month, <a href=\"https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2020/3-april/gazette/appointments/appointments\">Ruhumuliza was appointed interim minister</a> at Astley, Tyldesley and Mosley Common, Manchester. He could not be reached for comment.</p> <p>In a statement, the diocese of Manchester said: \u201cThe usual processes of checks and references were carried out by the diocese in making the appointment of Jonathan Ruhumuliza \u2026 No issues were raised with us during this transfer process.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for the C of E said: \u201cThe immigration tribunal and, subsequently, the court of appeal found in 2018 that Jonathan Ruhumuliza had the right to remain in the UK\u2026 Following the conclusion of this legal process, the C of E ascertained that clear support was shown for Bishop Jonathan from his [present] archbishop in Rwanda.

  "<p>There is a dreadful familiarity about the killing of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, by white police officers in Minneapolis last Monday. Floyd\u2019s final moments were videoed from a bystander\u2019s phone. He repeatedly pleads for mercy. His last words, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d, have become a rallying cry for often violent protests that have since shaken cities across America.</p> <p>The fact that the US has been here before, countless times, does not lessen the horror of this crime nor mitigate brutal police actions. Quite the opposite. It\u2019s right that all four officers involved have been sacked. One, who kept his knee pressed on the handcuffed Floyd\u2019s windpipe for several minutes even though he plainly did not pose a threat, has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/derek-chauvin-police-officer-charged-george-floyd\">charged with murder</a>.</p> <p>The widespread fury that this killing has aroused is not unprecedented. Similar eruptions followed high-profile police killings of black men, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/09/michael-brown-ferguson-death-black-men\">Michael Brown in Ferguson</a>, Missouri and Eric Garner in New York City, both in 2014. Nearly 30 years ago, rioting in Los Angeles sparked by the police beating of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/rodney-king\">Rodney King</a> left 63 people dead.</p> <p>All the same, this latest incident feels dangerously different, for three reasons. One is the sense that increasingly militarised US police forces, which often appear remote from and antagonistic to the communities they serve, have not learned the lessons of the past. This despite ardent campaigning by groups such as <a href=\"https://blacklivesmatter.com/\">Black Lives Matter</a> and the greater prominence of black people in public life.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This was a multiracial protest representing what is best in America against what was, in effect, a modern-day lynching</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>African Americans comprise 12% of the US population. But according to <a href=\"https://thesocietypages.org/toolbox/police-killing-of-blacks/\">data for 2015-19</a>, they accounted for 26.4% of those killed by police in all circumstances. Put another way, black people are three times more likely to be killed by police than white people, who form 61% of the population. While this is not a new problem, the repeated, systemic failure to fix it has become critical.</p> <p>A second exacerbating factor is Donald Trump and the unvanquished white supremacist thinking he personifies. This vile legacy has deep roots in an originally pro-slavery constitution, the blood myths of the confederacy, and <a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2019/09/26/american-immigration-century-racism/\">late 19th-century Nordicism</a>, eugenics and nativism, the period when the slogan \u201cAmerica First\u201d was coined.</p> <p>When Trump tweets menacingly about \u201clooting and shooting\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/twitter-hides-donald-trump-tweet-glorifying-violence\">as he did last week</a>, or mocks \u201cshithole countries\u201d in Africa, expresses a preference for migrants from Norway, and describes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/19/tracking-trump-charlottesville-bannon-worst-week\">Charlottesville neo-Nazis</a> as \u201cvery fine people\u201d, he echoes an ingrained, bigoted belief among some white people that black people are inferior \u2013 indeed, that black lives don\u2019t matter.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s behaviour has been predictably irresponsible and inflammatory. While mayors from Minneapolis to Atlanta and Portland struggled to maintain order, rightly shaming those who used the Floyd tragedy to indulge in theft and arson, Trump\u2019s main concern was to look tough in front of his mostly white base. He can kiss goodbye to the black vote in November.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e75672c2879f6f636662ab5d35ea27636e1cb323\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e75672c2879f6f636662ab5d35ea27636e1cb323/0_180_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kneeling protesters in face masks observe a moment of silence in Minneapolis\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters observe a moment of silence during the fourth day of protests in Minneapolis after the killing of George Floyd.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicholas Pfosi/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many other voter groups, including the Latinx and Asian communties, may also have been alienated. The demonstrators, most of whom acted lawfully, came from a range of racial and ethnic backgrounds, including white people. This was a multiracial protest representing what is best in America against what was, in effect, a modern-day lynching.</p> <p>The angry explosion was also a reaction to the societal stresses caused by the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 a third reason why this new episode in America\u2019s unending racial conflicts is different. The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-racism-african-americans.html\">disproportionate impact</a> of the virus on black people, in terms of death and infection rates, has unforgettably dramatised the corrosive inequality at the heart of American society.</p> <p>These protests will eventually cease. But injustice, bigotry and social malaise will not \u2013 not until all Americans want it.</p>",

<p>\u201cWe have a serious problem in Kandahar, PCR machine is off and there is no flight toward Kandahar so our engineers fix that, there will be a UN flight to Kandahar in coming days and our team will go with that,\u201d Majroh said this week.</p> \n  <p>Majroh said 40% of total confirmed cases were recorded in the 10 days before Eid and added that previously he was \u201cwarning that the flood [of coronavirus] will come, but now the flood has arrived and many people are sinking\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Everywhere in the country, the eastern province of Nangarhar and the northern province of
