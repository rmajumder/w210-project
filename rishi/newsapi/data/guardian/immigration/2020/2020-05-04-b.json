given a century-old <strong>tuberculosis vaccine</strong> on Monday in a trial to see whether the venerable formula can protect against coronavirus. </p> \n  <p>Devised at France\u2019s legendary Pasteur Institute 100 years ago, the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine is one of the world\u2019s oldest and most trusted immunisations. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWe vaccinated the first participant this morning,\u201d Duncan McDonald, head of business development and marketing at a clinical research organisation called TASK, told AFP. </p> \n  <p>Trials started at Tygerberg hospital in Cape Town, where BCG booster shots were administered to 250 health care workers, while another 250 received a dummy formula, or placebo. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThere are observations that this BCG vaccine does something to the immune system that we don\u2019t really understand,\u201d TASK founder professor, Andreas Diacon, said. </p> \n  <p>Children immunised with BCG tend to suffer less from respiratory illnesses, including asthma, he said. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIt makes the immune system cope better with respiratory retract infections,\u201d said Diacon. \u201cNo one actually really understands why it works.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Diacon and his team want to determine whether BCG could have an effect on coronavirus by reducing the risk of infection or easing symptoms. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIf you can reduce the (Covid-19) symptoms just a little, you will probably get people to survive this better or not even have to go to hospital or not even becoming ill,\u201d said Diacon. </p> \n  <p>The plan is to ramp up the trials to up to 3,000 health care workers in Cape Town.

Beijing faces a rising wave of hostility in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak that could tip relations with the <strong>United States</strong> into confrontation, Reuters reports. </p> \n  <p>The report, presented early last month by the ministry of state security to top Beijing leaders including president Xi Jinping, concluded that global anti-China sentiment is at its highest since the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, sources said.</p> \n  <p>As a result, Beijing faces a wave of anti-China sentiment led by the US in the aftermath of the pandemic and needs to be prepared in a worst-case scenario for armed confrontation between the two global powers, according to people familiar with the report\u2019s content, who declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter. </p> \n  <p>The report was drawn up by the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR), a think tank affiliated with the ministry of state security, China\u2019s top intelligence body. </p> \n  <p>Reuters has not seen the briefing paper, but it was described by people who had direct knowledge of its findings. </p> \n  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have relevant information,\u201d the

request for comment. </p> \n  <p>Reuters couldn\u2019t determine to what extent the stark assessment described in the paper reflects positions held by China\u2019s state leaders, and to what extent, if at all, it would influence policy. </p> \n  <p>But the presentation of the report shows how seriously Beijing takes the threat of a building backlash that could threaten what China sees as its strategic investments overseas and its view of its security standing. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"45ed20c14567af2d7a4bab3fbcf5b9519edba2fa\"> \n   <img

The orange departments will be declared red or green when a definitive map is published on Thursday. In any case, the French have been told not to make journeys of more than 100km without good professional or major family reasons after 11 May for the foreseeable future.</p> \n  <p>One of Macron\u2019s main objectives in ending the lockdown is to reopen the country\u2019s schools, but this is proving problematic. Nursery and primary schools will reopen classes on Tuesday, but with a maximum of between 10 and 15 pupils. The two lower years of secondary schools, will return the following Monday.</p> \n  <p>In Paris, City Hall estimates only 10% of nursery and primary school pupils will be able to return on Tuesday.

It has been communicated very badly and we feel like we have been left in the dark. We found out about it on the news when Grant Shapps [the transport secretary] <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52519340\">announced it</a>. Are they going to send us a letter or knock on our doors to tell us to download it? Still, I will use the app, and encourage others to do so.\u201d</p> <h2>Natasha Batty, 35, educator</h2> <p>\u201cIt is important that we learn from other countries like Germany and South Korea which adopted a test, track and trace approach. Having a pilot on an island makes sense and, as we have a relatively low number of cases, it could be a safe place to do it. It will be the only way to get out of the lockdown which is causing many a great deal of economic hardship, isolation and stress.\u201d</p> <h2>Sally Wilson, 47, ice cream deliverer</h2> <p>\u201cIs the Isle of Wight a valid place to test anything to do with coronavirus? We have an elderly population and only 127 cases [as of Sunday], <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/coronavirus-uk-how-many-confirmed-cases-are-there-in-my-area\">the fifth lowest per capita in the country</a>. We have had no contact whatsoever about this. We don\u2019t know if this means we will effectively be guinea pigs for the easing of the nationwide lockdown. I\u2019m happy to try, but I don\u2019t know if the island is the best place for it.\u201d</p> <h2>Richard Quigley, 48, former Labour parliamentary candidate</h2> <p>\u201cI am supportive of trialling the technology but not if it requires the early lifting of lockdown or social distancing, which I\u2019m assured it will not. The efficacy of this app may soon be called into question if it does not register contact between people who have not been together long enough or by providing false positives if people are in close proximity but have a wall dividing them.\u201d</p> <h2>Melanie Jones, 71, former teacher</h2> <p>\u201cI have isolated since the day over-70s were told to and I only go out for short walks when no one is about using my access to webcam at the bay which shows the footfall at the time. I\u2019m afraid that if people have got an app they may think that since they are being tracked there is no need to worry about abiding by the lockdown.\u201d</p> <p><em>Some names have been changed.</em></p>",
  "<p>Hotel Chocolat is to reopen up to five stores next week \u2013 for takeaways only \u2013 after restarting production at its UK factory to help top up dwindling supplies.</p> <p>The specialist retailer and cafe operator said it will reopen first in Borough Market in London, serving hot chocolates, ice-creams and coffees, as it tests out new ways of working while protecting staff and customers from the spread of the coronavirus.</p> <p>\u201cIt will help us to learn how to do things and control safe working,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/sep/15/hotel-chocolat-angus-thirlwell-making-chocolate-exciting-again\">Angus Thirlwell</a>, the chief executive and co-founder. Cafes are allowed to open for takeaways under the government\u2019s high street lockdown rules but Thirlwell said the position of the retail areas in its chocolate shops was \u201ca grey area\u201d \u2013 because it is not strictly essential food \u2013 so that part of the business would be kept closed.</p> <p>\u201cWe have decided to err on the side of caution, but it is important to get gradually open and get accessibility to chocolate increased,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He said the company had restarted production at its factory in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, last week. It has brought back from furlough about 80 staff, roughly a third of its factory workforce, to help resupply chocolate for the group as stocks had begun to run low. Thirlwell said the aim was to gradually bring back more staff over time, as long as social distancing measures such as perspex screens to divide staff on production lines and in the canteen continued to work well.</p> <p>Hotel Chocolat closed all its stores and its factory last month, three weeks before Easter \u2013 the second biggest selling period for chocolate.</p> <p>Since then sales have soared online \u2013 with analysts estimating trade has more than trebled. Overall trade is down significantly, however, as home deliveries have not been enough to offset the sales lost due to store closures.</p> <p>Thirlwell said Hotel Chocolat had been able to sell the vast majority of its Easter stock online after a \u201cchocolate version of Dunkirk\u201d in which stock was collected from stores and sent to the warehouse to be sold online. Key workers were also offered a 50% discount on the luxury chocolates, and thousands of eggs were given away to NHS hospital staff, care homes and food banks as the group\u2019s warehouse could not handle the volume.</p> <p>Since shops closed, tens of thousands of new shoppers have signed up to Hotel Chocolat\u2019s online service.</p> <p>Thirlwell said Hotel Chocolat\u2019s 125 stores and cafes remained important and he hoped to agree rent reductions with landlords and reopen them fully when allowed by the government. \u201cWe are talking to landlords to work out a mutually satisfying way of making them sustainable,\u201d he said.</p> <p>While no new stores are expected to open for a year, Thirlwell said: \u201cPeople came back to mingle with each other even after thebubonic plague and we hope people will come back [now]. The purpose of our retail locations is about leisure: hot chocolate or ice-cream or chocolates you weren\u2019t planning to buy. That\u2019s not well replicated online.\u201d</p>",

against misuse of data from the Covidsafe app. Criminal offences under the bill can be investigated by the Australian Federal Police. </p> \n   <p>Individuals can also have their complaints heard by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner or the relevant state or territory privacy regulator if appropriate.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>More than 4 million people have now registered

Later on I wondered who played the drums: oh, it\u2019s this guy Tony Allen. He became my superstar.</p> <p>It was the sound of Nigeria in a rhythm. It\u2019s that undeniable groove that makes you want to dance, and that\u2019s what I think and feel when I\u2019m around Nigerians. It\u2019s an energy, it\u2019s a force; it\u2019s not aggressive but it\u2019s not tame. When a Nigerian\u2019s in the room, you know a Nigerian\u2019s in the room, and that\u2019s how I feel about Tony\u2019s playing: once he lays that beat on a Fela track it\u2019s here to stay for the next half an hour.</p> <p>Tony said he\u2019d heard good things about me, and asked when was I gonna come and see him. I said: \u201cAny time!\u201d Like an ignorant Londoner I just assumed he lived in London, only to find out he lives in Paris. One of my friends told me you can get the Megabus there \u2013 say no more. I got it at 11pm, arriving in Paris at 6am. I would walk around Paris aimlessly for hours, and then I\u2019d have a drum lesson with him in the afternoon. But it was more than a lesson: we would sit down, hang out, eat. He was fun, he had a youthful buzz about him. He was grateful for life. It was like hanging out with an old uncle. He was awfully grumpy in the mornings, but by the evening he was great.</p> <p>He laughed when I was playing and said: \u201cWhy is everything so aggressive?\u201d I was like: \u201cWhat do you mean? It\u2019s the drums, man, that\u2019s what they\u2019re for!\u201d So for the first few lessons we worked on playing Fela Kuti beats really quietly together, really trying to get inside all the things about music that make a drum beat powerful, apart from sheer force.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f27a8d722b24210b9144ad12e375cd57c79436f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f27a8d722b24210b9144ad12e375cd57c79436f6/69_66_4257_2798/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Allen in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"657\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Allen in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another thing I got from him is how many ways there are to make people dance. Are you going to lay the most simple beat to keep a platform for everyone else, or something more complicated? I got all that from him. Whether I\u2019m playing with Jorja Smith or Ezra Collective, you\u2019ll always hear something I can directly point towards and say: I learned that from Tony Allen. He\u2019s the biggest musical influence on my playing, without a doubt.</p> <p>Questlove, Chris Dave, Moses Boyd \u2013 these are all people I know are directly influenced by Tony too, but none of us can make a beat sit down and groove like he did. It\u2019s so weird, because it\u2019s not even that hard. You\u2019ll look at the notes, what he\u2019s doing, and you\u2019re like: right, I can play everything in the right place. But when he does it, it just sounds better. Like when a really great narrator reads a sentence, it just has an authority to it that you couldn\u2019t give, even if you can read the same sentence. He had a special gift.</p> <h2>Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b270af06360385b73994899239695b3b1d0a6b40\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b270af06360385b73994899239695b3b1d0a6b40/1536_3_1680_2283/736.jpg\" alt=\"Angelique Kidjo.\" width=\"736\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Angelique Kidjo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurent Seroussi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve known Tony since the late 80s. I had never met someone so positive, it was crazy. With Tony, it\u2019s always about what can make the music beautiful, what can bring music to people\u2019s hearts, what can make them dance. He never bitched about anything, never blamed anyone for anything.</p> <p>He stayed as long as he could with the oppression in Nigeria with Fela. For his own sake, he had to leave to have a career. But was really grateful of the experience of being at the forefront, at the roots of Afrobeat. With Fela\u2019s band, the horns, the singing, everybody can go wherever they want, because they know when they come back, they know there\u2019s something holding them: Tony. He completely changed the way of playing drums: instead of hitting them hard, he put the percussionist\u2019s role into the drums. The cowbell is always the driver of Afrobeat, and that\u2019s why he plays so laid back. I\u2019m looking at him, like: \u201cYou don\u2019t even sweat. I\u2019m singing and sweating \u2013 come on Tony, man, don\u2019t rub it in, sweat a little bit!\u201d But he said: \u201cNo, I never sweat.\u201d</p> <p>Remain in Light by Talking Heads was influenced by Fela\u2019s album Afrodisiac, so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/12/angelique-kidjo-sings-talking-heads-review-royal-festival-hall-london\">when I covered it</a>, the whole thing was about bringing rock\u2019n\u2019roll back to Africa. I wanted to pay tribute to the courage of Talking Heads by not copying Afrodisiac but understanding the trance induced by the drums from west Africa. So I said to Tony: \u201cLet\u2019s bring it back home.\u201d We worked together again on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/19/angelique-kidjo-celia-review-magnificent-african-reinvention-of-salsa\">Celia</a>, my album of Celia Cruz songs, and afterwards Tony said: \u201cNow we have to do our own project together.\u201d I said: \u201cI would love that, but we should add Manu Dibango and do a killer album.\u201d And here we are, we didn\u2019t have a chance to start working [Dibango died in March].

The woman and person that I am, they respect it, before even respecting the artist that I am, and that is something that I derive my strength from.

And so to have such strong men who look at you and say: \u201cWhat are you afraid of? Go for it, we\u2019ll be here\u201d? I\u2019m flying high.</p> <p>Tony didn\u2019t speak much. He listened, and he had that smile:<em> I\u2019m sitting at my drums, and I\u2019m in heaven</em>. He would then look at me, and say: \u201cAre you ready?\u201d And he hit and I followed. You look at his hands, and his whole body \u2013 he\u2019s like a painter, a storyteller, he\u2019s just building everything around him. And you think, OK, this house is sturdy, I\u2019m going to sit in it and do whatever I have to do.</p> <p>When I was doing the album <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jan/23/angelique-kidjo-eve-review\">Eve</a>, I went back to Benin and cut some tracks with drummers there, and as soon as you say Tony Allen, they go: \u201cOh my God, it\u2019s because of him that I\u2019m doing drums.\u201d In the new generation of Afrobeats that\u2019s coming from Africa, Tony is at the centre of it \u2013 he allows the youth today to cut and paste, do whatever they want to do with that rhythm. Afrobeats is also proof of the back and forth of music that left Africa to go to Europe and come back. It\u2019s a constant exchange, it\u2019s non-stop \u2013 trying to stop it is like trying to fight immigration, it\u2019s impossible. And Tony is at the epicentre of it.

At night, the sound engineer would play a lot of Fela Kuti: super involving, a real discovery for me, and I was totally fascinated by the drums. Six months later, I was in Paris talking with friends and I said: \u201cOh la la, my favourite drummer is the drummer of Fela.\u201d Someone said: \u201cYou know his name is Tony Allen? And he lives in Paris, in a very strange place \u2013 La D\u00e9fense.\u201d Tony Allen is living in the business centre of Paris?! OK \u2013 I will call him for my new song.</p> <p>This was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crblDrrcunQ\">La Ritournelle</a>, a very important song for me. I already had the chords, the melody, and I was looking for a drummer. Tony asked for the music before he came in the studio, so he listened a lot to the piano. He was working a lot, but not playing \u2013 he was thinking about the music. Tony was a very intellectual guy. And at one point, boom, he\u2019s ready. I need maybe 15 or 20 takes to be happy, but Tony was a one-take guy. Maybe two, to be nice.</p> <p>I kept the entire take, I didn\u2019t do an edit of it. You can put the instruments in the computer and edit everything, but with Tony it was impossible to do that \u2013 the drums are too complicated. It\u2019s like a big river. It\u2019s a very human style of drumming, a lot of feelings, with a real story inside, and so if you edit it, you destroy the story.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30O92akDeJg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/30O92akDeJg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption> </figcaption> </figure>   <p>Before Tony, La Ritournelle was good, I liked the chords. But when Tony played, it was really magic. He chose to start the ride cymbal when the singing starts \u2013 you have maybe six minutes with the hi-hat, and when I sing, he moves to the ride. It gave a magical touch to the song, it was a brilliant idea. This guy was really a genius of drums. It\u2019s impossible to explain where the snare and kick is \u2013 it\u2019s like a fantastic salad, full of different little parts.</p> <p>He also brought a very good ambience to the studio \u2013 of international cool. Tony always wore a good outfit, super good sportswear. He was like a fantastic grandpa, kind of fragile but intense, and drinking a lot, smoking a lot. Like \u2013 a lot. The guy was always with a cloud of smoke around him. He was very discreet; he never told me: \u201cYou know I played with Fela Kuti, you know I invented Afrobeat?\u201d Mega humble, super nice, a high level of coolness. The outfits, the way he talks, the eyes: someone very cool and very intelligent. Small, polite, but with a huge aura.</p> <p>It was almost impossible to play this music on stage because I couldn\u2019t find any drummer who could play the Tony parts. He was an old man, and it wasn\u2019t really possible to do a tour like mine. So I always ask the new drummer: \u201cYeah, could you play La Ritournelle exactly like Tony?\u201d And it was just impossible. It\u2019s a very mysterious way to play drums. I guess it\u2019s because he learned to play drums by himself, he didn\u2019t take lessons, so he created another way to play.</p> <h2>Jeff Mills</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"dd3ffa46fced761ef90d94e1d0ab571d20ff7176\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd3ffa46fced761ef90d94e1d0ab571d20ff7176/0_0_750_948/396.jpg\" alt=\"Jeff Mills.\" width=\"396\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeff Mills.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacob Khrist</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Drummers like him are why guys decided to make drum machines, because the beats were so complex. Tony\u2019s music had a certain type of flow and rhythm that is like a piece of gold for a DJ: it would take a person to a higher level, and it didn\u2019t matter who you were or what you liked or where you were from, it had a very universal effect.</p> <p>My manager told me that Tony Allen had rented out a studio in Paris and was inviting artists to come in and just jam. It was a very simple, brief meeting \u2013 he didn\u2019t say much, we talked for a little bit, and then we set up and we started to play. And then we got into long conversations about everything \u2013 life and music.</p> <p>We toured together as a duo and there were no rehearsals \u2013 we just took to the stage and played what we felt. The set list was \u201cspontaneity\u201d, and to me, that\u2019s the highest form of communicating through music. We talked about politics or something up until the second that we took the stage, and then when we played together, we were emphasising those thoughts because they were still in our heads.</p> <p>He was a very kind person. He always liked to tell you things he\u2019s learned in the past, so that you don\u2019t make the same mistake. One of the last conversations we had, I asked him if life, or this world, was as crazy then as it was now, and he said: \u201cYeah, it was always crazy.\u201d That gave me a little bit of reassurance that we\u2019re not experiencing anything unusual.</p> <p>I asked him: \u201cThis way you\u2019re playing the snare, where did that come from?\u201d And he said that when he was growing up in Lagos, in one given day you\u2019re going to speak four or five different languages. That carried over into the nightlife \u2013 the snare was speaking these multiple languages, and he taught me that you are never quite sure who the music is speaking to, so speak to everyone. He told me someone once asked him: \u201cWhere\u2019s the one [the lead beat]?\u201d Because it\u2019s difficult to see where the rhythm starts. He explained that the one is everywhere, and it really depends on the listeners, where they come in and where they leave. So he was always showing me things, and teaching. We would have eye contact during our performances, and he would let me know if something was interesting or not.</p> <p>After the first few performances, I went home, went to a music store and bought as much percussion as I could \u2013 as an electronic musician I was programming machines to the point where I never really used my hands. What I was really looking for was something I had in my own character, and I never would have realised that had I not listened to him. When it comes to showing a higher level of rhythm, and approaching that in a very organic way, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone that I will meet that will show me as much as he did.</p> <h2>Susheela Raman</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"aed6b91ceac59e732c33fee58424446d28b4fbab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aed6b91ceac59e732c33fee58424446d28b4fbab/1131_1223_2059_2143/961.jpg\" alt=\"Susheela Raman.\" width=\"961\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Susheela Raman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I asked him to come and play on my 2003 album <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/jun/06/popandrock.artsfeatures7\">Love Trap</a>. With my previous album, Salt Rain, I had explored an axis of Europe, India and Africa, and this was an extension of that \u2013 we managed to find a musical space that was big enough to house all of those different elements, and I think Tony was proud of achieving that. He knew a lot about music, more than just groove. Sometimes you would hear him playing at soundcheck and you\u2019d feel this immense depth and weight, almost like it\u2019s been going on forever. He once said to me, my drumming is never-ending, and that\u2019s the feeling you got from him.</p> <p>He was very easy to play with \u2013 he didn\u2019t have an ego. He wore his legend quite lightly, and was kind and charming. We share a birthday, and we would phone each other up each year for the last 15 years. When he came to London he would come and visit us, and play you his new music, and it was like \u2026 you know how teenagers are when they\u2019ve got a new demo? He had that childlike demeanour. He was always so enthusiastic about life and music, he had a real zest for living.</p> <h2>Moses Boyd</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7f54be4c5e00cacb80b951109dfaffdb06861c9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f54be4c5e00cacb80b951109dfaffdb06861c9c/0_1738_3513_3311/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Moses Boyd.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"942\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Moses Boyd.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not many drummers have redefined drum language. It\u2019s kind of like what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2009/jun/16/cult-j-dilla\">J Dilla</a> did for drummers \u2013 even though he wasn\u2019t a drummer, what he did with the MPC [sampler] changed the way drummers played. Tony is one of those innovators, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/may/20/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\">Elvin Jones</a>, like Tony Williams \u2013 you can\u2019t come up after Tony and not be influenced by what his contribution to the drums is. He is almost in a world of his own.</p> <p>I first met him in 2016 and ever since I\u2019d always run into him hanging or playing with someone. He was a lot of fun, and he had a lot of time for musicians. He was this funky, youthful 79-year-old. He became very uncle-like, and loved a good time, always had some whisky or weed.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been lucky enough to meet and talk with a lot of the masters, like Roy Hargrove, Roy Haynes, James Moody, Jimmy Heath \u2013 they all had the same youthful inquisitiveness. Tony too, it felt like he was fresh and ready to take on whatever the show was. Not everyone\u2019s blessed like that, some people get stuck in their thing, and that\u2019s cool \u2013 they like to do what they do. But Tony always seemed wide open.</p> <h2>Gilles Peterson</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3048c9cb3a965b4fefc700230a7f3f2c4881b5a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3048c9cb3a965b4fefc700230a7f3f2c4881b5a2/331_155_1924_2404/800.jpg\" alt=\"Gilles Peterson.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gilles Peterson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jesse FK Howard</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the mid-80s, I used to DJ at Electric Ballroom in Camden on a Friday night. Upstairs was what they called the jazz room, where all the dancers would dance off and battle. Two Fela Kuti tracks that Tony Allen played on, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60nXpLhld38\">Roforofo Fight</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvYxd35xFx8\">Shakara</a>, were two of the most essential tracks that I had. Not only were they incredible, but they were also long, and allowed for a serious battle to ensue.</p> <p>From Fatboy Slim playing Roforofo Fight at Glastonbury to Q-Tip playing it at Output to Louie Vega playing it in Tokyo, any DJ playing any kind of music, whether it\u2019s hip-hop, house or disco, will have been saved at least once by a Tony Allen track. Whenever I saw him, I felt like I should pay him a percentage of my fee. The songs were generally quite long, so they always gave you enough time to get your head together \u2013 if you\u2019re slightly nervous and need to settle into the zone, start with a Fela track. Or if you need a toilet break.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvX_iNFcKho\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XvX_iNFcKho?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>His music worked at 90bpm as well as it worked at 140bpm, that was the other magic about it. Even the slower stuff \u2013 Water No Get Enemy, Fear Not for Man \u2013 is brutally powerful in the same way roots reggae is, or heavy dubstep by Mala. It was almost like he created a beat that was ahead of the drum machine, it was so constant. And if you\u2019re used to dancing on the fourth beat, you can fall into a four within his beat, but if you want to dance to the offbeat, you can find that too. There\u2019s several different rhythms to latch on to, depending on what you like. And that\u2019s really powerful \u2013 he\u2019s managed to incorporate the swing and the hypnotic, two very different areas. You really have to mess up, or the crowd has to really suck, if they don\u2019t dance to Tony Allen records.</p> <h2>Oumou Sangar\u00e9</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"fba47b8f24950b8bf694b59edef0631cc8165fcb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fba47b8f24950b8bf694b59edef0631cc8165fcb/873_0_1303_1126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oumou Sangar\u00e9.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"864\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oumou Sangar\u00e9.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Benoit Peverelli</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tony Allen marked all of my childhood \u2013 I used to dance a lot to his Afrobeat music.

I\u2019m a drummer myself, and Tony was like somebody from another world. How he kept the beat, how steady it was, it was so upfront and so precise \u2013 he was like a drum machine with soul. He was playing not only beats, but melodies \u2013 his drums were singing, you know?</p> <p>In my studio, we set up my drum kit and he was so happy to sit behind it. It\u2019s like I could feel his destination. It was so genius how he did his contributions to this steady electronic beat, how he loosened it up. He was never trying to put himself in the foreground, only support. And it was so complex. He was giving so much that it was almost enough on its own. I thought of making him the first person, changing the whole role of having a drummer. Usually a drummer is used as a backbeat, and I love that, but sometimes I was thinking to exchange these old conservative roles, and have him being the one that\u2019s the main musician, and me add synth music to his playing. We never tried, but it would have been great to do it.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxb8hadpr24\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nxb8hadpr24?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>His playing was impossible to copy because no one in the world would be able to play it. And it was so light, as if it was floating \u2013 maybe the same as his personality! We had some beautiful times together. He was kind of a father figure, always embracing people, very humble. Kind of the same as he was behind the kit. We talked about our problems; we had some beautiful conversations about family and friendship. He was 75 when we played with him and we went to Japan, Australia, but he never argued or moaned. He was fighting through for playing, and you could see when you looked into his eyes that he really loved to play. He was a close friend \u2013 I felt like a son to him. And he was a genius, no?</p>",

But as food supplies dwindle, many in Texas are being turned away and experts and community workers say that the food crisis is hitting the state\u2019s large immigrant population especially hard.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/17/us-food-banks-over-budget-demand-coronavirus\">'We may have to ration': US food banks face shortages as demand surges</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The TDEM documents are from its most recent state situation report and show food banks in the state are seeing an 88% increase in the number of people showing up to food distribution centers, but sector representatives say that even those figures may understate the surge.</p> <p>Celia Cole is CEO of <a href=\"https://www.feedingtexas.org/\">Feeding Texas</a>, an association of the state\u2019s food banks. Cole said: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing now close to a 100% increase in the number of people seeking out help compared to last year. That means that there\u2019s double the need there was a year ago.\u201d</p> <p>But these numbers only represent the people that food banks are actually able to supply.</p> <p>TDEM\u2019s situation report adds: \u201cIn the last two weeks, Texas food banks report having to turn people away at approximately 30% of their distributions\u201d.</p> <p>Cole said that early in the crisis, Texas food banks \u201cwould take food to a distribution that might normally have 100 families, take enough food for 200 families and then 800 families would show up\u201d.</p> <p>As a result, Cole said, food banks in the state are depleting their supplies quickly. \u201cIf I look at our five largest food banks, which is where the greatest volume is going out, they\u2019re reporting on average they\u2019re going to run out of food in a couple of weeks. That\u2019s scary. Those food banks are where you\u2019re seeing the lines of a thousand people show up,\u201d she said.</p> <p>In addition, as demand soars, the normal source of donations, surplus from grocery stores, has dried up.</p> <p>According to the situation report, Texas food banks are reporting a 13% decrease in monetary donations and a 39% decrease in food donations. And a relatively older volunteer workforce in partner agencies such as churches, which usually handle distribution of food packages, is sheltering in place to avoid contracting Covid-19.</p> <p>\u201cThis is by far the biggest crisis we\u2019ve ever faced and the greatest need we\u2019ve ever seen across our network,\u201d Cole said.</p> <p>While the Trump administration recently announced a <a href=\"https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2020/04/17/usda-announces-coronavirus-food-assistance-program\">Coronavirus Food Assistance Program</a> (CFAP), in which the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) will buy meat and produce to be distributed to food banks, Cole says that it will not come quickly enough to solve food banks\u2019 immediate problems.</p> <p>\u201cUSDA has struggled to procure this food and we don\u2019t expect them to arrive at our food banks until July,\u201d she said.</p> <p>In an email, a USDA spokesperson said: \u201cUSDA is working as quickly as possible to implement CFAP.\u201d</p> <p>Raj Patel, a research professor at the University of Texas at Austin and the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Raj-Patel/e/B001JRVKDO%3Fref=dbs_a_mng_rwt_scns_share\">several books</a> on food systems and food security, said the crisis in Texas had hit a state that already struggled with poverty and food insecurity.</p> <p>He said that in 2015, a <a href=\"http://rajpatel.org/2016/07/11/alimentary-my-dear-austin/\">survey</a> by himself and his colleagues \u201cfound that 25% of people in Austin, Texas, which is not a poor city, were food insecure.\u201d</p> <p>Patel added that Texas\u2019s deteriorating food security has been exacerbated by the hard line immigration policies of the Trump administration. \u201cPeople are worried about Ice raids,\u201d Patel said.</p> <p>In Austin, he said: \u201cAs soon as a rumor circulated that Ice was staking out food banks and supermarkets in Latinx neighborhoods that undocumented people might go to, all of a sudden, Latinx people wouldn\u2019t go there and someone had to become the designated shopper for a bunch of families.\u201d</p> <p>Carmen Llanos Pulido is a community organizer and the Executive Director of <a href=\"https://www.goaustinvamosaustin.org/our-beginnings\">Go Austin/Vamos!

  "<p>Since taking office in March, Slovenia\u2019s rightwing prime minister, Janez Jan\u0161a, has been busy on Twitter. He has called critical journalists liars and \u201cpresstitutes\u201d, and said the director general of the World Health Organization (WHO) should resign. On Wednesday, he retweeted an article suggesting press freedom advocates who had raised alarm about his actions had been using cocaine.</p> <p>Jan\u0161a, who has a Trump-like tendency to fire off inflammatory tweets and is a close ally of the far-right Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, took office after the country\u2019s previous prime minister, Marjan \u0160arec, resigned, hoping for early elections. Jan\u0161a was able to form a coalition with his Slovenian Democratic party and three other parties.</p> <p>In its first weeks, the government\u2019s attention has been largely focused on the response to coronavirus, and Slovenia has so far managed to keep numbers of infections and deaths low.

Slovenia will hold the rotating EU presidency next year.</p> <p>The 61-year-old Jan\u0161a has made a very similar <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/06/hungary-viktor-orban-election-migration\">political journey to Orb\u00e1n</a>, starting out three decades ago as a pro-democracy fighter and gradually shifting further right over the years, picking up anti-migration and climate sceptic rhetoric along the way. Jan\u0161a\u2019s political campaigns have used xenophobia, Islamophobia and hate speech, said Boris Vezjak, a professor at the University of Maribor in Slovenia.</p> <p>Like Orb\u00e1n, he has been accused of backing cronyism and corruption. In 2013 he was sentenced to two years in prison for bribery, but his conviction was annulled by the constitutional court because of a lack of direct evidence and he was released after six months in jail. He denied all accusations.</p> <p>Jan\u0161a, who has had two brief previous spells as prime minister, is backed by a television network funded by Hungarian figures close to Orb\u00e1n, and the network\u2019s former director Ale\u0161 Hojs has been made Jan\u0161a\u2019s new interior minister.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"53191692c5d4e3405bf070c5af54878749a398ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53191692c5d4e3405bf070c5af54878749a398ab/0_152_5502_3301/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A protest in Ljubljana against Janez Jan\u0161a and his government last month over alleged corruption.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protest in Ljubljana against Janez Jan\u0161a and his government last month over alleged corruption.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ziga Zivulovic Jr./EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cLike Orb\u00e1n, he is good at distracting from the abuse of resources with anti-Brussels and anti-migrant rhetoric,\u201d said Florian Bieber, a regional expert at the University of Graz. \u201cHe is also very thin-skinned.\u201d</p> <p>Jan\u0161a has picked up on some of Trump\u2019s talking points around the coronavirus, including <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JJansaSDS/status/1247978340667006981?s=08\">calling for </a>the resignation of the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

An official government account retweeted a claim that the journalist was an \u201cescaped psychiatric patient\u201d and said he was suffering from \u201cCovid-Marx/Lenin\u201d.</p> <p>Zgaga said the attacks had led to a wave of hate mail and threats. \u201cI have been under police protection before, I have been smeared before, but I have never experienced anything like this,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A consortium of press freedom associations, including Reporters without Borders, wrote an an <a href=\"https://ifex.org/european-commission-must-guarantee-the-safety-of-slovenian-journalist-blaz-zgaga/\">open letter</a> to V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1, the EU commission\u2019s vice-president for values and transparency, calling on her to take up the matter with the Slovenian government. It chronicled the series of smears on Zgaga and said \u201cwe fear for his life after supporters of the Slovenian government declared him an enemy of the state\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cNo hate, no threats, no personal attacks. Contact taken with Slovenia to discuss situation,\u201d Jourov\u00e1 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/verajourova/status/1253608153868046336?s=11\">wrote on Twitter</a> last week. Jan\u0161a does not appear to be taking the rebuke seriously. \u201cNo single figure in Slovenian history has done more to discredit the journo community than this liar,\u201d he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JJansaSDS/status/1253355298535899143?s=08\">wrote</a> in response.</p> <p>Rights activists also say there are worrying signals about the new government\u2019s post-coronavirus agenda. Last Tuesday, parliament passed a law that removes the rights of most NGOs to take part in environmental assessments of infrastructure projects. Billed as a way to help kickstart the economy post-coronavirus, NGOs in Ljubljana, the capital, say it will allow the government to plough ahead on controversial construction projects without taking environmental concerns into consideration.</p> <p>A restraining factor on Jan\u0161a is likely to be that he has to govern in coalition, and with an electorate that has traditionally veered centre left, this will make it harder to attempt to redraw the county\u2019s political scene.</p> <p>\u201cJan\u0161a is ready to go as far as Orb\u00e1n, no doubt about it, but luckily the opposition is still strong and maybe also the coalition will not be willing to support him until the end,\u201d said Vezjak.</p>",
  "<p>Spring, in the days of lockdown, continues obliviously \u2013 and reminds us how we depend on the natural world. For anyone with the luck to have a garden, the varied consolations of even a small patch of land will be clearer than ever. Sue Stuart-Smith\u2019s fascinating book, written before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a> crisis, brings indebtedness to nature into new focus and, during a time in which many of us are compelled by our phones and computers, extends the awareness \u2013 backed up by compendious and elegant research \u2013 of how mentally enriching it is to swap screen for green.</p> <p>Stuart-Smith is a psychiatrist and psychotherapist, married to celebrated garden designer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/10/gardens-great-plains-tom-stuart-smith\">Tom Stuart-Smith</a>. Their style of gardening is a sympathetic collaboration with nature, eschewing high-handed interventions. An early photograph \u2013 in 1988 \u2013 shows them surveying newly dug beds in their Hertfordshire garden. Nothing much is growing \u2013 apart from the baby in Sue Stuart-Smith\u2019s arms \u2013 and they are at a momentary standstill, lost in thought. The photo makes the point: gardens begin \u2013 and continue \u2013 in the mind.</p> <p>The book begins with the moving story of Stuart-Smith\u2019s grandfather, Ted, whose submarine ran aground in the Dardanelles in 1915 and who became a prisoner in Turkey\u2019s brutal camps. He returned a haunted wraith, wearing \u201ca battered old raincoat with a Turkish fez on his head\u201d. His fianc\u00e9e, Fanny, restored him with sips of soup \u2013 but it was gardening that rescued him for the long haul. Ted is the first of many in the book for whom mental illness is relieved by gardening. Nature, Stuart-Smith reminds us, neither rejects nor judges.</p> <p>As a young woman, she dismissed gardening as \u201coutdoor housework\u201d. Now, she reports on how a long gardening session can leave you \u201cfeeling dead on your feet but strangely renewed inside \u2013 both purged and re-energised, as if you have worked on yourself in the process\u2026. gardening catharsis.\u201d Gardening can help with grief and be a way of making peace with mortality. It is a \u201cmeeting place between our innermost, dream-infused selves and the real physical world\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He who tills a field, renders a better service to mankind than all the scribblers in Europe, wrote Voltaire</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The neutrality of nurturing plants positively affects those who have themselves received little care, and Stuart-Smith enlightens us by explaining how caring is neurologically important. She visits exceptional therapeutic gardens including the <a href=\"https://insightgardenprogram.org/\">Insight Garden</a> project at San Quentin jail, <a href=\"https://www.horatiosgarden.org.uk/\">Horatio\u2019s Garden</a> for spinal-injury patients at Salisbury hospital, and a vegetable garden for recovering addicts in San Patrignano, Italy. Plants are easier to deal with than people (even if they have their own ways of answering back).</p> <p>This is not a book of effusions. It is attractive because quietly considered. It encourages us to garden \u2013 but gentle push never comes to shove. Stuart-Smith suggests that gardening, throughout history, has been civilising and about reciprocity \u2013 a mix of dream and slog. And there is no shortage of thinkers to stake her arguments. Freud was an avid orchid lover and cherished his garden in West Hampstead. Jung said: \u201cWe all need nourishment for our psyche. It is impossible to find such nourishment in urban tenements without a patch of green or a blossoming tree\u201d, and Donald Winnicott recklessly climbed a tree towards the end of his life (to the alarm of his wife) to do some tree surgery and create a better view.</p> <p>Stuart-Smith satisfyingly expands on Voltaire\u2019s \u201c<em>Il faut cultiver n</em><em>otre jardin</em>\u201d. Rejecting conventional formality, Voltaire planted thousands of trees on his land in eastern France and asserted: \u201cI have only done one sensible thing in my life \u2013 cultivate the ground. He who tills a field, renders a better service to mankind than all the scribblers in Europe.\u201d Sue Stuart-Smith renders a very special service with this book. Let\u2019s hope it reaches not only the converted but those who need it most.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac0943e17c10001926208f8d8a682eda64fe4434\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac0943e17c10001926208f8d8a682eda64fe4434/0_385_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Elation comes in many forms\u2019: Isabel Hardman in London\u2019s Richmond Park\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Elation comes in many forms\u2019: Isabel Hardman in London\u2019s Richmond Park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>The Natural Health Service</em> makes a robustly argued companion piece that has grown out of fragility \u2013 the work not of a psychiatrist but of a patient. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/isabelhardman\">Isabel Hardman</a>, assistant editor of the <em>Spectator</em>, has suffered from PTSD, been dogged by the Black Dog and had times when she has felt suicidal.

However, the book holds its own as an inquiry into nature as tonic. Elation comes in many forms: an unexpected orchid in a Glasgow car park, a shy kingfisher by the Thames, and Penny Black, a headstrong pony in Wimbledon. She writes about forest bathing and about walking, running and cold water swimming (she breaks the ice on the Serpentine \u2013 that most masochistic of life-affirmations). She never overstates her case. She acknowledges the need for more research, recognises the importance of placebos and remembers that each individual prescription will be different. These natural cures, she is especially keen to maintain, should be for everyone.

  "<p>Knowing how to control the spread of coronavirus is not rocket science. But actually doing it has proved elusive and difficult for many governments across the world. When China first alerted the World Health Organization about a novel coronavirus on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-100-days-that-changed-the-world\">31 December</a>, the countdown began for countries to each prepare. Some, such as South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong, were scarred by their recent experiences with two other deadly coronaviruses, Mers and Sars, and so reacted quickly to the coming threat. Others, such as the UK and US, consumed with domestic political issues, watched and waited, anticipating that this new virus would be more similar to a bad flu strain.</p> <p>We are now almost four months into this pandemic, and the lessons that can be drawn from east Asian countries on how best to control this coronavirus and keep daily new cases as low as possible are clear. Eight aspects in particular stand out as important for governments to recognise as they navigate difficult choices ahead. They also provide a guide for what the public should be expecting of and demanding from their governments.</p> <p>The first is to aggressively identify where the virus is and break chains of transmission. This requires a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/england-coronavirus-testing-has-not-risen-fast-enough-science-chief\">test, trace, isolate</a>\u201d policy that involves mass community testing, tracing those who had been in contact in the previous week with any individual testing positive, and putting all of those individuals into a mandatory quarantine. Governments and local municipalities would have to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/28/uk-contact-tracing-plans-an-nhs-app-and-an-army-of-health-staff\">recruit and train foot soldiers</a> to carry this out.<strong> </strong>While testing itself is not a solution, it is a crucial part of a package of public health interventions needed to keep identifying clusters of infection and breaking these apart. Keeping daily cases low through this approach keeps the burden off hospitals and allows bare-bones economic and social activity to occur.</p> <p>The second is to protect health and social care workers who are most at risk from contracting the virus and who are exposed to high <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/why-do-some-young-people-die-of-coronavirus-covid-19-genes-viral-load\">viral loads</a> during the course of doing their jobs. This protection needs to involve not only priority access to testing, but also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/27/uk-doctors-finding-it-harder-to-get-ppe-kit-to-treat-covid-19-patients-research-reveals\">appropriate personal protective gear</a> that is readily available. Much attention has been paid to ensuring that there are enough ventilators, beds and oxygen and much less to the need for sufficient and skilled frontline staff, who cannot be manufactured in days or weeks.</p> <p>The third is to keep constant surveillance of the virus using tracking systems to detect whether certain parts of the country are becoming hotspots and whether sub-populations, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/singapore-million-migrant-workers-suffer-as-covid-19-surges-back\">migrants living in close quarters</a>, have a higher incidence of the virus. This can be done by building on existing flu surveillance networks and ensuring that data is shared in real time. Tied into this point is lesson four, which is about monitoring borders for imported cases. Travel bans towards certain countries have limited effectiveness, but blanket <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/new-zealand-tells-arrivals-to-self-isolate-for-two-weeks-including-citizens\">14-day quarantines</a> for any international arrivals can ensure that new cases are detected quickly rather than setting off more clusters of infections. </p> <p>The fifth is that clear and honest communication with the public is required to keep trust and compliance with the necessary policy guidance. This is an unsettling time for everyone as rules are introduced around daily behaviour and misinformation is rife. Therefore, consistent and straightforward messaging on why policies are being introduced and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/uk-to-name-scientific-advisers-on-emergency-coronavirus-group-sage\">transparency</a> on how governments are making their decisions is essential to create a beacon of trusted information in a sea of noise.</p> <p>The sixth is recognising that any \u201cexit\u201d strategy is not like a switch that means life will go back to pre-Covid days. A \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/boris-johnson-returns-to-no-10-and-a-government-under-pressure\">new normal</a>\u201d will need to be adjusted to, which is likely to involve distancing whenever possible; possible temperature checks when entering public buildings and offices; and the use of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/24/face-masks-mandatory-spread-coronavirus-government\">face masks in public</a>. The goal is to achieve some economic and social activity while keeping procedures in place that reduce the transmission of the virus.</p> <p>The seventh lesson is that lockdowns, if introduced early and quickly, can slow the spread of the virus, but are not a solution by themselves. They are a costly and crude policy instrument that should be used as sparingly as possible. They allow governments to buy time and use this time to massively increase important public health infrastructure. </p> <p>The final lesson is that all of the above are short-term strategies while countries await key scientific findings to create informed policy decisions and find the ultimate \u201cexit strategy\u201d. There are huge gaps in what we know about this virus, including about immunity, the individual risk of developing severe symptoms and how long it will take to develop an effective vaccine or therapy. But the steps above can ensure that countries keep daily new cases low and avoid a repeat of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/05/1918-flu-pandemic-coronavirus-drug-trials-scientists-treatments-evidence\">1918 flu pandemic</a>, which was determined, in the end, by the \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d.</p> <p>\u2022 Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh</p>",

Higher death rates due to lungs and hearts weakened by dirty air is the best understood. Pollutants also inflame lungs, potentially making catching the virus more likely and raising concern about rising pollution levels after lockdowns are lifted. Finally, particles of pollution might even help carry the virus further afield.</p> \n<p>The studies done so far around the world are mostly \u201cpre-prints\u201d \u2013 they have not yet been endorsed by independent scientists through the peer-review process. This involves several experts examining the work and requiring any flaws to be addressed but approval usually takes six months to two years.</p> \n<p>Researchers caution that plausibility is far from proof, and correlation does not necessarily mean causation, as many other factors may be important.

But it does show how normalised the massive death toll from air pollution has become, and points to what can be achieved if we shift to clean energy.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, not all air pollution scientists agree that research should be fast-tracked while the pandemic is still raging, rather than waiting months or years to be sure of the results. </p> \n<p> Prof Mark Goldberg, at McGill University in Canada, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/air-pollution-covid-19-and-death-the-perils-of-bypassing-peer-review-136376\">who has criticised the Harvard study</a>, said: \u201cI have nothing against the hypothesis [linking air pollution and Covid-19], it is highly plausible. But if you do a study which is filled with potential biases, you\u2019re not doing the public any good by publishing. [Fossil fuel lobbyists] are just going to say, \u2018Well, why should we believe anything you do?\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Prof Francesca Dominici, who led the study at Harvard, disagreed: \u201cI think the responsible reaction from a scientist is to respond to a pandemic by doing the best that you can with the data that you have. We want to provide a warning.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe criticisms are all absolutely valid [but are] very disappointing because none of us is trying to bypass the peer review system at all. All our papers are going to be reviewed and, of course, to make new legislation, the work has to be better. We know that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dominici said the general message she wanted the research to convey was that the most polluted areas are the ones where efforts should be prioritised.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe other message is about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/31/trump-epa-obama-clean-car-rules-climate-change\">rolling back of regulatory standards for air pollution</a> in the US,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a respiratory virus that kills people out there \u2013 this is not the right time to give permits to industry to pollute our air.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"067526b7423b868e8fa3648eb9f44c807ec7f747\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/067526b7423b868e8fa3648eb9f44c807ec7f747/0_292_4033_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclists sit on the upper slopes of Greenwich Park overlooking the London skyline.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cyclists sit on the upper slopes of Greenwich Park overlooking the London skyline.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Hicks/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Luis Miguel Martins, at the University of Cambridge, led the analysis of England\u2019s air pollution and Covid-19 cases, which was criticised for not taking into account other possible factors.</p> \n<p> \u201cOur point in publishing, soon after other studies in Italy, Germany and the US, was to say \u2018look, this might be a global phenomenon and not just local\u2019. However, we could only deal with the data we had available.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cI still think peer-review is essential, but constructive criticism can act as an informal peer-review mechanism,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20067405v3\">revised version of our work</a>, we normalised cases or deaths by the population densities and applied a better statistical model. This validated our conclusions.\u201d</p> \n<p>Prof Frank Kelly, at Imperial College London, UK, said his group was not publishing preliminary analyses. \u201cThe Harvard study has been the best but there are still major issues with it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Air pollution research has often shown it leads to small increases in people\u2019s individual risk of many diseases but, because entire populations are exposed to dirty air, the total increase in health damage is large.</p> \n<p>It is not yet clear how big the impact of air pollution is on the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cThat is a really difficult question to answer at the moment,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2020/apr/28/covid-19-what-role-might-air-pollution-play-podcast\">said Prof Anna Hansell</a>, at the University of Leicester. \u201cI suspect it is in line with our general observations of air pollution. But if you look across a whole population, a small increase in risk is something you might want to do something about and air pollution is a modifiable risk factor.\u201d</p> \n<p>Kelly is concerned about the rise in air pollution after the end of lockdowns, as is <a href=\"https://eeb.org/air-pollution-returns-to-china/\">already being seen in China</a>. \u201cCurrently, air quality in cities is pretty good because of the shutdown,\u201d he said. Rising air pollution will increase inflammation in the lungs of some people. \u201cIf they are then exposed to a separate wave of the virus, the question is whether they will be more susceptible than the general population.\u201d</p> \n<p>All the researchers hope that the dangers of air pollution exposed by the coronavirus pandemic and the cleaner skies seen during the lockdowns will lead to lasting change. Some cities, such as <a href=\"https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2020/04/coronavirus-reopen-cities-public-transit-car-free-bike-milan/610360/\">Milan, Rome, Berlin, Brussels, Paris</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/covid-19-coronavirus-mexico-city-bike-paths/\">Mexico City</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Oakland-closing-streets-to-traffic-enabling-15193171.php\">Oakland, California</a>, have taken action, at least temporarily, to cut car use and increase cycling and walking.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"048cd2ae35517d93fbab398c32fa7e5c45d817ba\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/048cd2ae35517d93fbab398c32fa7e5c45d817ba/0_0_3747_2498/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People wear masks as they walk the streets of Mexico City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People wear masks as they walk the streets of Mexico City.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jos\u00e9 M\u00e9ndez/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The WHO is asking people to photograph the clear skies they are seeing during lockdowns. \u201cWe can use those clean memories to inspire a more healthy and green recovery,\u201d said Neira. But economic arguments must also be made, she said.</p> \n<p>She highlighted the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/18/fossil-fuel-companies-getting-10m-a-minute-in-subsidies-says-imf\">subsidies fossil fuels enjoy</a>, the damage to people\u2019s health from air pollution and the huge cost that adds to health services.</p> \n<p>At some point in the future, researchers will be able to calculate how many extra Covid-19 cases and deaths were due to the world\u2019s dirty air. \u201cBut whatever the research concludes in the end, the most important issue is that we need to make sure that after Covid-19 the recovery will be a healthy recovery, because we want to reduce vulnerability,\u201d said Neira.</p> \n<p>Hansell agreed: \u201cI really hope people hang on to how life can be different and think about the lower air and noise pollution they have been enjoying.\u201d </p> \n<p>For Kelly, whether dirty air returns or the coronavirus crisis spurs the clean up of our towns and cities remains in the balance: \u201cThat\u2019s the million dollar question.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Breakfast used to be the easiest meal of the day. Everyone ate whatever they had time for (which, on a regular day, would be toast or nothing). None of us had to think too much, because even if you didn\u2019t stay full until lunch time, you would probably be working and have to wait to take your break. Now that there is nothing to stop any of us eating all day long, this needs a little more thought.</p> <p>The new logistics are baffling. I feel like I am running a haulage company. If everyone in the household eats when they wake up, you will have cleared up the kitchen five times before lunch. This is insane; you might as well mill your own flour. Ideally, you want to wait until the last person is hungry, which is around 11.30am. Perfect: you have rolled breakfast into lunch, and now you only have two avalanches of dishes to worry about. But now the breakfast has to be good: nobody is going to wait until 11.30 for cornflakes.</p> <p>Other than \u201cgood\u201d, my criteria in this top 10 are: interesting; low effort in technical terms (no piping bags), but I\u2019m not ruling out a bit of an overnight project; moderately healthy; meat-free. If I let meat into the mix, I would basically eat sausages every morning, and then I would have nothing to eat for dinner.</p> <h2>Beans on toast</h2> <p>Sure, just get beans out of a tin and put them on toast if you like. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/01/20-best-breakfast-recipes-part-4-nigel-slater-pancakes-omelettes\">you can do your own baked beans</a> as a magnificent gift to the family at the start of the week. And I assume that you are making soda bread around the clock anyway, since you have surely run out of yeast.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26b29343b515f07368654e2bc8290ab7a6ea8801\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26b29343b515f07368654e2bc8290ab7a6ea8801/0_176_3648_2189/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shakshuka.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rich and luxurious: shakshuka.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Shakshuka</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.hairybikers.com/recipes/view/shakshuka\">These Middle Eastern baked eggs</a> aren\u2019t fast, but they are only a moderate pain to make and the result is fabulously, alchemically good. The tomatoes become rich and luxurious, and the peppers offer a sweetening contrast to the eggs. You won\u2019t find many other sound reasons to get this many vitamins into a breakfast.</p> <h2>Jugged kippers</h2> <p>The chef Fergus Henderson is pretty adamant that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/sep/29/20-best-breakfast-recipes-part-2-egypt-asia-mexico-kippers-nigel-slater-fergus-henderson\">kippers should be baked with butter and washed down with a black velvet (champagne and Guinness)</a>. I have nothing against the black velvet, but I do have reservations about how much your oven smells, and by extension, your whole house, and for how long \u2013 which is all day. If, instead, you put the kippers in a jug in their bag, pour in boiling water and leave for four minutes, they are just as good and much less assertive, and you can put the butter on afterwards.</p> <h2>Turkish breakfast</h2> <p>This isn\u2019t really a recipe: on your table, assemble white pitta bread, very punchy black olives, feta, cucumber and tomatoes, jam and honey. Eat in whatever order or combination you like. Close your eyes. Wham! You\u2019re on holiday.</p> <h2>Congee</h2> <p>This is easily the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/sep/29/20-best-breakfast-recipes-part-2-egypt-asia-mexico-kippers-nigel-slater-fergus-henderson\">best vegan breakfast I know</a>: jasmine rice cooked super-slowly so that it turns into \u2013 look away, novices, I\u2019m going to use a technical term \u2013 gloop, then loaded with vegetables and chillis, to become an emotionally complex experience of ultimate comfort and pure excitement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ff18ff51190da2ca60c0b6b182d974fe454e5ce9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff18ff51190da2ca60c0b6b182d974fe454e5ce9/0_211_4608_2765/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Overnight oats with chia seeds and blueberries and honey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Overnight oats with chia seeds and blueberries, with a helping of honey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eva B Astrand/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Overnight oats with vanilla, blueberry and chia</h2> <p>On no account let your 10-year-old find an overnight oats recipe from YouTube, because you will end up with something loaded with bananas, syrup, bits of Wispa and not enough milk, that is as heavy as a brick, as sweet as baklava and totally disgusting, which pride will force her to chow her way through, to cries of \u201cStop! Stop! You\u2019ll end up in a coma\u201d that can be heard for miles about.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/11/six-of-the-best-healthy-breakfasts\">A very basic bircher recipe</a>, on the other hand, is wonderful \u2013 hearty, wholesome, filling, but quite light, especially if you use apple juice rather than milk or almond milk. Take 100 grams of oats, grate in an apple, moisten with enough juice so that the mixture is soaked but not swimming, and leave overnight. Using vanilla, blueberries and chia creates a more professional version.</p> <h2>Soaked porridge</h2> <p>Mr Z soaks oats in water overnight, cooks them in the same water the next day, and says they taste better than cooking from scratch. I have always totally disregarded this idea, as it sounds like a faff and I have never liked porridge. (When I was a kid, we lived near the old Young\u2019s brewery in Wandsworth in south London and had a childminder. She told me that the disgusting brewery smell was porridge. Her rationale was that she didn\u2019t want to put me off beer. Fair play; I am now an adult who hates porridge and really likes beer.)</p> <p>Imagine my surprise, reader, when I tried Mr Z\u2019s tip for research purposes, and it was incredible. The result was inexplicably rich, although I did add a tablespoon of double cream and one of jam, so maybe it can be explained.</p> <h2>Indian omelette</h2> <p>I usually use Madhur Jaffrey\u2019s recipe, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/01/20-best-breakfast-recipes-part-4-nigel-slater-pancakes-omelettes\">this one, by Vivek Singh</a>, is also perfect. The green chilli is a kick in the chops, but it is a delicate and charming one, such as you might get from a rabbit. The coriander is wonderfully lively, too. If you stack the omelette with vegetables, it hits just about every note of nutritional excellence, offering enough protein and fat to keep you full and no carbs to make you sluggish.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"50bc86ae6edd1545169b4be63ef018f8aba0dd36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50bc86ae6edd1545169b4be63ef018f8aba0dd36/0_289_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pancakes with yogurt and blueberries\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pancakes with yogurt and blueberries \u2026 versatile.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arx0nt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Buttermilk pancakes</h2> <p>My Mr also <a href=\"https://www.divertimenti.co.uk/search?q=pancake+smiley\">wanted this smiley-faced pancake pan</a>, which I completely overruled on grounds of cost, and limited use, and the fact that our children are too old, and it was silly etc etc. It was only when he made the appeal on behalf of our unborn grandchildren that I realised how much it meant to him. It was thus that I discovered the marvellous versatility and incredible yield of the buttermilk pancake<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/buttermilk_pancakes_10390\">. This recipe</a> will feed everyone who is pancake-inclined for a week (cook them all on the first day, then keep them in the bread bin). They are lovely with bacon, and also with berries. If you are out of buttermilk, you can use watered-down yoghurt.</p> <h2>Harisa</h2> <p>Not the smoky sauce (that\u2019s harissa), but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/11/six-of-the-best-healthy-breakfasts\">the sweet pearl barley dish</a>. If I had been living out of the store cupboard for a year, it would never have occurred to me to soak barley overnight and then cook it with cinnamon and sugar. The look is exquisite, pomegranate seeds sparkling like jewels in the rough. The smell actually <em>is </em>a bit brewery.</p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p>",

  "<p>Paloma P\u00e9rez, a smoker who has dealt with pancreatitis and cancer, has more reason than many to fear the coronavirus as she waits out the lockdown in her house in the mountains outside Madrid.</p> \n<p>To limit her exposure, the 74-year-old has told the home help who used to pop in twice a week to stop coming, and her main meal of the day \u2013 usually fish or meat, but with a decent variety of sides \u2013 is left outside her closed front door by the Catholic charity C\u00e1ritas.</p> \n<p>The nightmares P\u00e9rez suffered when the pandemic began have receded and she is adapting to the enduring lockdown with far fewer problems than many people in Spain.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m single, my relatives are quite far away and I was an only child, so I\u2019m quite used to being on my own,\u201d says P\u00e9rez. \u201cI was always alone, playing on my own or living alone, so maybe that means I\u2019m better prepared for this.\u201d</p> \n<p>C\u00e1ritas has reported a surge in pleas for help since Spain went into national lockdown on 14 March.

In the first quarter of 2020, the Spanish economy <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/economy_and_business/2020-04-30/spanish-economy-falls-52-in-first-quarter-the-biggest-drop-in-nearly-a-century.html\">shrank by a record 5.2%</a>. The country\u2019s GDP is forecast to drop by 9.2% this year, while unemployment is expected to rise from 14.4% to 19%.</p> \n<p>\u201cThings here really aren\u2019t that great at the moment, especially for families that were in a vulnerable situation before this hit,\u201d says Mar\u00eda Blanc, a spokeswoman for C\u00e1ritas.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"180bfaed53e5da32a312ad78a8028b5ede7af1a8\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/180bfaed53e5da32a312ad78a8028b5ede7af1a8/0_207_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Doctors of the World workers distribute food to migrants from Mali in Nijar, southern Spain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Doctors of the World workers distribute food to migrants from Mali in Nijar, southern Spain.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Juan Medina/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cAll the job losses and temporary layoffs we\u2019re seeing have left some people without food.

The cooks, cleaners, carers, drivers and waiters who have managed to make ends meet over recent years can no longer support themselves or their families. And those who could once rely on a good summer season to see them through a whole year are growing desperate as the shutdown continues.</p> \n<p>\u201cNo one\u2019s ever been through this before,\u201d says Blanc. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s going to last.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Spanish Red Cross, meanwhile, plans to spend \u20ac11m on helping more than 1.3 million people during an initial two-month operation that will directly assist vulnerable members of society, such as homeless, unemployed or disabled people, and victims of domestic violence. Much of its response is built on the lessons learned from the 2008 crash.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/emea\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>As well as helping to relieve some of the pressure on Spain\u2019s overstretched health system, it is also providing food and medicine to those who can no longer afford them.</p> \n<p>But, as Mois\u00e9s Ben\u00edtez, a national manager for the Spanish Red Cross, points out, this current crisis is unprecedented.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen you have a flood, you work out who the most affected people are: who\u2019s lost their home; who\u2019s lost their crops,\u201d he says. \u201cBut this is a very particular kind of emergency because it has affected the entire population. And we\u2019re seeing a surge in the number of people who are vulnerable because of the lockdown.\u201d</p> \n<p>The NGO is feeding destitute migrants in slum encampments at the same time as supplying thousands of tablets to poorer families so that children can keep up with their schooling.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe hardest thing has been finding ourselves in a crisis that is universal, and which affects everyone,\u201d says Ben\u00edtez.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe knew who some of the people who would need help were, but we\u2019ve also had to innovate as we came across new groups. The 2008 crisis discriminated between rich and poor \u2013 this one doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p> \n<p>While it may be an egalitarian blight, Covid-19 is already being felt most keenly by the most marginalised of the marginalised \u2013 including sex workers and victims of trafficking.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0cdb10c2970e04d36e1dc0926eadada8c554d414\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0cdb10c2970e04d36e1dc0926eadada8c554d414/0_179_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People queueing for food aid in Madrid on 2 May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People queueing for food aid in Madrid on 2 May.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denis Doyle/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cSome of our colleagues are in a horrific situation right now; some don\u2019t have money to buy food for their kids, let alone pay the rent,\u201d says Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Barrera, a spokeswoman for the Prostitutes\u2019 Collective of Seville.</p> \n<p>\u201cA lot of our colleagues are undocumented immigrants who have symptoms of the coronavirus but who are too scared to go to the doctor because they\u2019re worried about being reported to the authorities.\u201d</p> \n<p>Prostitution was decriminalised in Spain in 1995 and the sector is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/may/11/prostitution-tackling-spain-sex-traffickers\">now thought to employ</a> about 300,000 people.</p> \n<p>Idoia Ugarte, a lecturer in nursing who works with Doctors of the World in Castilla-La Mancha, the Spanish region with the most brothels, offers a similar assessment.</p> \n<p>Since the national state of emergency was declared, the NGO has been keeping in touch with sex workers by phone. While the women say the number of men seeking sex has fallen since the lockdown kicked in, demand has not disappeared.</p> \n<p>The problem is that many women are already so indebted to pimps, traffickers, or the brothels and clubs where they live and work, that they have no choice but to risk their health by continuing to have sex for money, even as the virus spreads.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe situation is fairly critical because if they get into more debt, the only way they have to pay it off is through prostitution,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re having to run a terrible risk.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Ugarte and her colleagues welcome the government\u2019s recent announcement that sex workers and victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation will be offered support, emergency accommodation and access to the new benefit to be known as the minimum vital income while the crisis lasts.</p> \n<p>But they worry that the services will be hard for many affected women to access and could end up being little more than a sticking plaster. The longer the pandemic continues, Ugharte adds, the greater the physical and mental toll it will take.</p> \n<p>\u201cThese women are in a precarious state in every way,\u201d she says. \u201cEmotionally and psychologically, they\u2019ve suffered collateral damage from working in prostitution. But now they need money \u2013 and not just for themselves. A lot of the women send it back to their families in their home countries, and those families are also in a crisis situation because of the pandemic. At the moment, these women just can\u2019t see any way out of this.\u201d</p> \n<p>If the coronavirus\u2019s physical symptoms include fever and a cough, its defining psychological legacy is the sense of uncertainty and powerlessness that mingles with the fear and the boredom.</p> \n<p>\u201cEvery time you turn on the TV, you hear about all the people who are dying and there\u2019s nothing you can do,\u201d says Paloma P\u00e9rez as she prepares to eat her latest doorstep lunch. \u201cThings seem to be getting a bit better, but it\u2019s always hanging over you and we know there\u2019s an economic crisis on the way.
