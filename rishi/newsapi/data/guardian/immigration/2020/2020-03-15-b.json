  "<p>More than two centuries ago there was cruel and rude gossip about how startlingly close the relationship between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/williamwordsworth\">William Wordsworth</a> and his sister Dorothy was.</p> <p>\u201cThe rumour mill has continued,\u201d admitted Zoe Gilbert, visitor experience manager at Wordsworth\u2019s childhood home in Cumbria. \u201cWe still get asked that question today.\u201d</p> <p>A new exhibition will, in part, explore the true nature of the siblings\u2019 relationship, suggesting it was unusually close but not sexual.</p> <p>It was, said the Wordsworth expert Kathleen Jones, an \u201camazingly close bond\u201d founded on the deep psychological trauma of being split up as young children and then reunited in their late teens.</p> <p>The National Trust is staging the exhibition at its property <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/wordsworth-house-and-garden\">Wordsworth House and Garden in Cockermouth, Cumbria</a>, to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the poet\u2019s birth.</p> <p>It explores Wordsworth\u2019s childhood and how his life and poetry was shaped by the wild, outdoor upbringing he and his sister enjoyed at the house on the banks of the River Derwent.</p> <p>Among the exhibits will be Dorothy\u2019s tiny baby bonnet, handsewn most likely by their mother Ann. It is the only item from their childhood to survive.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/17/wordsworth-treasures-donated-to-poets-lake-district-home\">Wordsworth treasures donated to poet's Lake District home</a> </p> </aside>  <p>William was eight and Dorothy was seven when their mother died and they were split up. She was sent to relatives in Yorkshire and five years later they became orphans when their father died. Dorothy did not reunite with her brother for nine years.</p> <p>\u201cDorothy was passed around like a parcel,\u201d said Jones. \u201cIt had a deep psychological impact.</p> <p>\u201cFor someone like Dorothy who was very sensitive, very emotional \u2013 what we\u2019d now call highly strung \u2013 that childhood bond with her brother was all she could remember of security and love, everything to do with family.\u201d</p> <p>When they finally met again a syndrome called \u201cgenetic attraction\u201d happened, said Jones.</p> <p>\u201cThey looked into each other\u2019s eyes and they saw a similar person with similar feelings \u2026 this is what happens when you fall in love with someone. You meet someone and think wow this person is so like me, all that empathy, everything. They had shared so much.\u201d</p> <p>When William married his wife Mary, Dorothy went through a type of grief which led him to giving his sister his wedding ring to wear before the big day. \u201cAn extraordinary thing to do,\u201d said Jones.</p> <p>Dorothy then lived with William and Mary for the rest of her life. \u201cHis wife must have been very patient,\u201d said Gilbert. \u201cThere were always three in the relationship.\u201d</p> <p>The childhood of William and Dorothy and its effect on their lives is explored in a series of films at the exhibition featuring Jones and the poet Helen Mort.</p> <p>Jones argues that Dorothy was an astute judge of her brother\u2019s poetry and played an important part in his wellbeing. He was \u201ca man who needed a lot of positive reinforcement and Dorothy gave him that\u201d.</p> <p>The exhibition title, The Child is Father of the Man, comes from a line in Wordsworth\u2019s 1802 poem <a href=\"https://nationalpoetryday.co.uk/poem/my-heart-leaps-up/\">My Heart Leaps Up</a>. He is suggesting that childhood experiences help form an adult\u2019s character, but also that people should hold on to their childhood sense of wonder in the natural beauty of the world.</p> <p>The bonnet is a remarkable survivor, with no one knowing quite how it came to be passed down over 250 years to its current owners, <a href=\"https://wordsworth.org.uk/\">the Wordsworth Trust in Grasmere.</a></p> <p>Gilbert said: \u201cAnybody visiting this year will see how events from childhood, objects which have survived or been lost, and other memories can connect them to their own past.</p> <p>\u201cDorothy\u2019s baby bonnet, as the sole item to remain from the siblings\u2019 childhood, is especially precious and evocative.\u201d</p> <p>The exhibition also features objects from William\u2019s later life, including his ice skates and his tinted spectacles, which shine a light on the poet\u2019s lifelong anxieties about health and his fear of going blind.</p> <p>\u2022 The Child is Father of the Man is at Wordsworth House and Garden, 14 March-8 November.</p>",
  "<p>Nosebleeds are normally a result of a ruptured blood vessel in the nose. Common causes include picking or blowing your nose, sneezing vigorously and high blood pressure.</p> <p>Do not lie down or tilt your head back, as the blood will drip into the back of your throat and block the airway. Sit down, lean forward and pinch the soft part of the nose. You can use an ice pack or frozen peas in a tea towel on the bridge of the nose if you want to, but it is not normally necessary.</p> <p>Pinching the soft part of the nose helps to form a clot and stop the bleeding. Pinch for 10 minutes, then let go to see if it has stopped. If it has not, pinch again.</p> <p>If the bleeding is severe or lasts for more than 30 minutes, or if you are on blood-thinning tablets (which would cause you to lose a lot more blood), you should seek medical help.</p> <p>If the nosebleed has been caused by a head injury, the blood may be thin and watery, which could mean fluid is leaking from around the brain. This could be a sign of a significant head injury, so you should definitely go to the hospital. Ideally, for 24 hours after the nosebleed has stopped, avoid blowing your nose, strenuous exercise or consuming hot drinks or alcohol. This gives the clot enough time to fully develop and for the blood vessel to repair itself. This is not always realistic, though, so try to give it at least a few hours.</p> <p><em>Dr Lynn Thomas is </em><em>the medical director at St John Ambulance</em></p>",
  "<p>While the fate of this football season remains in the balance, Virgil van Dijk has spoken of his fear that Liverpool\u2019s first title success in three decades will eventually be secured in an empty stadium while fans are excluded because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>The season is on hold with action due to restart on 4 April, though such an early resumption is widely considered unlikely.

  "<p>Sami Tamimi was 17 when he moved out of his family home in East Jerusalem\u2019s Old City. He was gay and he knew his Muslim father especially would struggle to accept that. \u201cI was an angry kid,\u201d recalls Tamimi, who is now 52, at one of his restaurants, Rovi in central London. \u201cBecause of the whole sexuality thing, I couldn\u2019t talk about it to anybody. But I come from a different place now. I had a lot to prove. And I did it. I\u2019m not angry now. The opposite.\u201d</p> <p>Tamimi worked in West Jerusalem and Tel Aviv before moving to London in 1997 where he was head chef at the deli Baker &amp; Spice. Here he met Yotam Ottolenghi, an Israeli who also grew up in Jerusalem. Ottolenghi left in 2001 to start his own place, and Tamimi joined not long after; they have been business partners ever since.</p> <p>It was while they were putting together recipes for their 2012 bestseller <em>Jerusalem</em> that Tamimi began to appreciate how his Palestinian roots influenced his food. But he remained estranged from his family. \u201cI lost contact for almost 17 years,\u201d he says, with a wistful shake of his head.</p> <p>\u201cTime flies when you\u2019re chopping an onion,\u201d adds Tara Wigley, one of the \u201cOttolenghi family\u201d for a decade, who shares the writing with Tamimi on a new cookbook, <em>Falastin</em>.</p> <p><em>Falastin</em> \u2013 there\u2019s no \u201cp\u201d in Arabic \u2013 is, Wigley says, \u201cSami\u2019s love letter home\u201d. Tamimi calls it simply: \u201cThe book I always wanted to write.\u201d He goes on, \u201cIt\u2019s the food I always go back to; it\u2019s my mother\u2019s kind of cooking. The legacy of Ottolenghi started with these flavours.\u201d</p> <p>What is Palestinian food? The answer is complicated. In Gaza, it is dominated by fish and spices; in the West Bank, it is meats, flatbread and fermented yogurt. Tahini, za\u2019atar and shatta, a condiment made from red or green chillies, are ubiquitous. \u201cPeople are ready to zoom in, rather than just call it Middle Eastern food,\u201d says Wigley, who worked alongside Ottolenghi on <em>Plenty More</em> and <em>Simple</em>. \u201cNo one needs to know from us how to make tabbouleh traditionally, so we\u2019ve got three new tabboulehs. But we also have chicken musakhan, sumac onions and the \u201cupside down\u201d maqluba dish.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPalestinian food is very earthy, it\u2019s not pretty to look at,\u201d Tamimi chips in. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of beige and brown. We had a few arguments before we decided: \u2018OK, we\u2019re gonna have to zhuzh it up a bit.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Both Wigley and Tamimi spent time with Palestinian chefs and home cooks. For Wigley, it was an opportunity to tell the stories of individuals in <em>Falastin</em>. For Tamimi, it was a chance to reconnect with his huge family. \u201cEvery day, they\u2019ll invite you for breakfast and you go home at midnight,\u201d he laughs. \u201cThey\u2019re competing to cook the best meal for me. We don\u2019t ever say, \u2018I love you,\u2019 but you show it in different ways.\u201d</p> <h2>Hummus two ways \u2013 kofta &amp; aubergine</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d9fb8edf09cc704926fbc78cd1d287c5ee01a66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d9fb8edf09cc704926fbc78cd1d287c5ee01a66/0_1820_4883_4731/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hummus two ways.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"969\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Hummus should, ideally, be served freshly made and still warm. If you do want to make it in advance, though, that\u2019s fine: just store it in an airtight container and keep it in the fridge for up to 4 days. If the hummus develops a bit of a skin then just give it a stir before serving. The most important thing if storing in the fridge, is to bring it back to room temperature before serving, to warm and loosen up.</p> <p>The meatballs can be made, rolled and kept in the fridge for a day before serving, all ready to fry. If doing this, store them in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days, but don\u2019t pack them too tightly: you want them to keep their round shape. They also freeze well, for up to a month. If you fry them from frozen they will need a couple more minutes in the oven to warm through.</p> <p><em><strong>Serves </strong></em><em><strong>6 </strong></em><br><em><strong>For the hummus </strong></em><br><strong>dried chickpeas </strong>250g, soaked overnight in double their volume of water <br><strong>bicarbonate of soda</strong> 1 tsp <br><strong>tahini</strong> 270g <br><strong>lemon juice</strong> 60ml <br><strong>garlic</strong> 4<strong> </strong>cloves, crushed <br><strong>salt</strong> <br><strong>ice-cold water</strong> 100ml</p> <p><em><strong>For kofta </strong></em><em><strong>hummus</strong></em><br><strong>beef or veal mince (or a mixture of both)</strong> 500g <br><strong>onion</strong> 1 small, peeled and coarsely grated <br><strong>tomato</strong> 1 large, coarsely grated and skin discarded (65g) <br><strong>parsley </strong>20g, finely chopped<br><strong>red chilli</strong> 1, deseeded and finely chopped<br><strong>olive oil </strong>about 45ml, to fry<br><strong>salt and black pepper</strong></p> <p><em><strong>For the kofta hummus topping</strong></em><br><strong>olive oil</strong> 1 tbsp <br><strong>pine nuts </strong>25g <br><strong>parsley</strong> 5g, roughly chopped <br><strong>Aleppo chilli flakes</strong> \u00bd tsp (or \u00bc tsp regular chilli flakes) <br><strong>mint leaves </strong>a few (optional)</p> <p><em><strong>For aubergine </strong></em><em><strong>hummus</strong></em><br><strong>aubergines</strong> 2 large, cut into roughly 2cm cubes (500g) <br><strong>sunflower oil </strong>about 300ml, to fry <br><strong>walnut halves </strong>160g, roughly chopped <br><strong>parsley leaves</strong> 10g, roughly chopped <br><strong>mint leaves </strong>10g, roughly chopped <br><strong>lemon juice</strong> 2 tbsp <br><strong>olive oil </strong>2 tbsp <br><strong>Aleppo chilli flakes</strong> \u00bd tsp</p> <p>To make the hummus, drain the chickpeas and place them in a medium saucepan on a high heat. Add the bicarbonate of soda and cook for about 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Add 1\u00bd litres of water and bring to the boil. Cook for about 30 minutes \u2013 timing can vary from 20 to 40 minutes depending on the freshness of the chickpeas \u2013 skimming off any foam that appears. The chickpeas are ready when they collapse easily when pressed between thumb and finger: almost but not quite mushy.</p> <p>Drain the chickpeas and transfer them to a food processor. Process to form a stiff paste and then, with the machine still running, add the tahini, lemon juice, garlic and 1\u00bd teaspoons of salt. Finally, slowly drizzle in the iced water and continue to process for another 5 minutes: this will feel like a long time but it is what is needed to get a very smooth and creamy paste. Transfer to a bowl and set aside at room temperature, until needed. If you are making it in advance then transfer to a sealed container and keep in the fridge. Remove it half an hour before serving, to bring it back to room temperature, and give it a good stir if a \u201cskin\u201d has formed.</p> <p><strong>To make the kofta </strong><strong>hummus:</strong> Place all the ingredients for the meatballs, apart from the olive oil, in a medium bowl with 1 teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Using your hands, mix well to combine. With wet hands, roll the mixture into roughly 3cm balls (weighing about 15g each): you should make about 45 balls.</p> <p>To make the topping, put the tablespoon of oil into a large frying pan and place on a medium heat. Add the pine nuts and cook for a minute, stirring constantly, until they are golden brown. Spoon the nuts, along with the oil from the pan, into a little bowl and set aside.</p> <p>Add a tablespoon of the oil for frying the kofta to the same pan and place on a medium heat. Add a third of the meatballs \u2013 or as many as you can fit into the pan without overcrowding \u2013 and cook for about 3 minutes, turning throughout so that all sides take on colour and the balls are just cooked through. Keep them somewhere warm while you continue with the remaining balls, adding another tablespoon of oil with each batch.</p> <p>When ready to serve, spoon the hummus into individual shallow bowls, creating a slight hollow in the centre of each. Divide the meatballs between the bowls, placing them in the middle of the hummus, and spoon over the pine nuts and their cooking oil. Sprinkle over the parsley, chilli and mint, if using, and serve with a final drizzle of olive oil.</p> <p><strong>To make the aubergine </strong><strong>hummus: </strong>Place the aubergines in a colander placed over a bowl or in the sink and sprinkle over 1 teaspoon of salt. Use your hands to mix well, then set aside for about 45 minutes: this is so that the bitter juices can be released. Transfer the aubergines to a tray lined with kitchen paper and pat dry as best you can.</p> <p>Put the sunflower oil into a medium frying pan and place on a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the aubergines \u2013 in two or three batches so as to not overcrowd the pan \u2013 and fry for about 8 minutes, until completely softened and golden brown. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the aubergines to another tray lined with kitchen paper (or the same tray lined with fresh kitchen paper) and set aside, for the excess oil to be absorbed, while you continue with the remaining batches. Transfer the aubergines to a bowl, add the walnuts, parsley, mint, lemon, olive oil and Aleppo chilli and mix well to combine.</p> <p>When ready to serve, spoon the hummus into individual serving bowls, creating a small well in the middle of each portion. Spoon in the aubergine and serve at once.</p> <p>Serve the hummus with warm pita for scooping, along with a chopped salad to lighten things up.</p> <h2>Shatta (red or green)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fcabbf86484351d837c44553fcfe4b5cb39cd28d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fcabbf86484351d837c44553fcfe4b5cb39cd28d/0_0_5064_5765/878.jpg\" alt=\"Shatta, red and green.\" width=\"878\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This fiery condiment is as easy to make as it is to become addicted to. Shatta is there on every Palestinian table, cutting through rich foods or pepping up others. Eggs, fish, meat, vegetables: they all love it. Our recommendation is to keep a jar in your fridge or cupboard at all times.</p> <p>Once made, shatta will keep in the fridge for up to 6 months. The oil will firm up and separate from the chillies once it\u2019s in the fridge, so just give it a good stir, for everything to combine, before using.</p> <p>As with anything being left to ferment, the jar you put your chillies into needs to be properly sterilised. There are various ways to do this. A water bath (where the jars go into the water, with their lids added separately, the water is brought to the boil and then the jars are \u201ccooked\u201d for 10 minutes), or filing them with just-boiled water and then rinsing and drying them with a clean tea-towel. We tend to just put them into the dishwasher and run it as a normal wash: it works very well.</p> <p><em><strong>Makes 1 medium jar </strong></em><br><strong>red or green chillies</strong> 250g, stems trimmed and then very thinly sliced (with seeds) <br><strong>salt</strong> 1 tbsp <br><strong>cider vinegar</strong> 3 tbsp <br><strong>lemon juice</strong> 1 tbsp <br><strong>olive oil</strong> to cover and seal</p> <p>Place the chillies and salt in a medium sterilised jar and mix well. Seal the jar and store in the fridge for 3 days. On the third day, drain the chillies, transfer them to a food processor and blitz: you can either blitz well to form a fine paste or roughly blitz so that some texture remains. Add the vinegar and lemon juice, mix to combine, then return the mixture to the same jar. Pour enough olive oil on top to seal, and keep in the fridge.</p> <h2>Baby gem lettuce with burnt aubergine yogurt, smacked cucumber &amp; shatta</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6ce78ed0e5850dd19f2e5002275733afcf12105\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6ce78ed0e5850dd19f2e5002275733afcf12105/0_908_5197_5191/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shatta\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This works well either as a stand-alone starter or as part of a spread or side. It\u2019s lovely with some hot smoked salmon or trout. Thanks to Ottolenghi chef Calvin Von Niebel for this salad. The shatta needs to be made in advance.</p> <p>Some crumbled feta on top works very well, and if you don\u2019t have the urfa chilli flakes, just use a pinch of black nigella seeds or some black sesame seeds.</p> <p><em><strong>Serves </strong></em><em><strong>4 generously </strong></em><br><strong>baby gem lettuces</strong> 5-6 (500g), bases trimmed <br><strong>salt and black pepper </strong><br><strong>red or green shatta </strong>1\u00bd tbsp (see recipe above), or rose harissa, as an alternative <br><strong>urfa chilli flakes </strong>\u00bd tsp (or a small pinch of nigella seeds or black sesame seeds)</p> <p><em><strong>For the aubergine yog</strong></em><em><strong>urt </strong></em><br><strong>aubergines</strong> 2 large (500g) <br><strong>Greek-style yog</strong><strong>urt</strong> 35g <br><strong>garlic</strong> \u00bd clove, roughly chopped <br><strong>lemon juice</strong> 1\u00bd tbsp <br><strong>tahini </strong>1\u00bd tbsp (25g)</p> <p><em><strong>For the smacked cucumber </strong></em><br><strong>cucumber </strong>1 regular English (ie not a small Lebanese), peeled, sliced in half lengthways and watery seeds removed (180g) <br><strong>parsley</strong> 25g, roughly chopped <br><strong>mint leaves</strong> 25g, roughly chopped <br><strong>garlic</strong> \u00bd clove, roughly chopped <br><strong>olive oil </strong>50ml</p> <p>The more you char your aubergines, the smokier the flesh. Unless you don\u2019t mind your whole house smelling of aubergines, ventilation is key. We char our aubergines in one of two ways. The first, if you have a gas cooker, is to put one aubergine over each gas ring, switch the flame on high and leave it there for 15-20 minutes, turning halfway with long tongs so that all sides get charred. Any mess can be minimised if in the first place if you cover your stove top with tin foil. Make holes in the foil for the gas rings to pop through, then proceed.</p> <p>If you have an induction hob, heat up a chargrill pan until very hot \u2013 sit it on a high heat for at least 5 minutes, until it is smoking. Pierce the aubergines a few times with a sharp knife then add them to the pan. This method takes longer than the open flame \u2013 around 35-40 minutes, again turning throughout with tongs so that all sides get charred \u2013 but will get the same result. At the end of the 40 minutes, transfer the aubergine to a foil-lined tray and place under a hot grill for 10 minutes.</p> <p>Once charred, place the aubergines in a colander. When cool enough to handle, slit them open to scoop out the flesh and place in a clean colander. Set aside for an hour or so (or overnight) over a bowl to drain.</p> <p>The scooped-out flesh should weigh about 160g. Place this in the bowl of a food processor along with the yogurt, garlic, lemon juice, tahini and \u00bd a teaspoon of salt. Blitz for about a minute, until completely smooth, then set aside until needed.</p> <p>Prepare the cucumber by placing each half on a chopping board, cut side facing down. Using the flat side of a large knife, lightly smack them until bruised but still holding their shape. Cut the cucumber into roughly 1cm dice and set aside in a dish.</p> <p>Clean the food processor, then add the parsley, mint, garlic, olive oil and \u00bc a teaspoon of salt. Blitz for about 2 minutes, scraping down the sides a couple of times if you need to, to form a smooth paste, then add to the cucumber. Set aside for at least 20 minutes (and up to a day in advance if kept in the fridge) for the flavours to infuse.</p> <p>Slice each head of baby gem lengthways to make 8 long thin wedges (per lettuce). When ready to assemble, arrange the lettuce on a round platter, overlapping the outer and inner circle to look like the petals of a flower. Lightly sprinkle the wedges with salt and a grind of black pepper, then splatter over the aubergine yogurt. Spoon over the cucumber, drizzle with the shatta, sprinkle over the chilli flakes and serve.</p> <h2>Prawn &amp; tomato stew with coriander pesto</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a0c055208d237a92cdfa9153bdbf49849d918b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a0c055208d237a92cdfa9153bdbf49849d918b9/67_779_4585_4585/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prawn tomato stew\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Serve this as it is, with some crusty white bread to mop up the juices, or dot some cubes of white feta or black olives (or both) on top. A crisp green salad with a lemony dressing on the side and you\u2019re all set.</p> <p>Batch-make the base for the stew here, if you like: this freezes well and keeps in the fridge for a good few days. That way you can just char your cherry tomatoes and pan-fry the prawns in minutes. The coriander pesto can also be made up to 3 days in advance and kept in the fridge.</p> <p><em><strong>Serves </strong></em><em><strong>4 </strong></em><br><strong>cherry tomatoes </strong>250g <br><strong>olive oil</strong> 60ml <br><strong>onion </strong>1 large, finely chopped (180g) <br><strong>garlic</strong> 4 cloves, crushed <br><strong>ginger</strong> 2cm piece, peeled and finely grated (15g) <br><strong>green chilli </strong>1, finely chopped <br><strong>coriander seeds</strong> 2 tsp, lightly crushed in a pestle and mortar <br><strong>cumin seeds</strong> 1\u00bd tsp, lightly crushed in a pestle and mortar<br><strong>cardamom pods </strong>8, lightly bashed in a pestle and mortar <br><strong>dill</strong> 20g, finely chopped <br><strong>tomato puree </strong>2 tsp <br><strong>plum tomatoes </strong>6, roughly chopped (500g) <br><strong>salt and black pepper </strong><br><strong>raw king prawns</strong> 600g, peeled</p> <p><em><strong>For the coriander pesto </strong></em><br><strong>coriander</strong> 30g, roughly chopped <br><strong>green chilli</strong> 1, finely chopped <br><strong>pine nuts</strong> 50g, lightly toasted <br><strong>lemon</strong> 1, finely grate the zest to get 1\u00bd tsp, then cut into wedges, to serve <br><strong>olive oil</strong> 80ml</p> <p>Place a large saut\u00e9 pan on a high heat. Toss the cherry tomatoes with 1 teaspoon of oil and, once the pan is very hot, add the tomatoes. Cook for about 5 minutes, shaking the pan once or twice, until blistered and heavily charred on all sides. Remove the tomatoes from the pan and set them aside.</p> <p>Wipe the pan clean, add 2 tablespoons of oil and replace it on the stove on a medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook for about 8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened and lightly browned. Add the garlic, ginger, chilli, spices, dill and tomato puree and cook for another 2 minutes, until fragrant. Add the plum tomatoes, 300ml of water, 1\u00bd teaspoons of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Bring to a simmer, then lower the heat to medium and cook for about 25 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened and the tomatoes have completely broken down.</p> <p>While the sauce is cooking, make the coriander pesto. Put the coriander, chilli and pine nuts into a food processor and pulse a few times until the pine nuts are roughly crumbled. Transfer to a bowl and add the lemon zest, oil, \u00bc teaspoon of salt and a grind of black pepper. Mix to combine, then set aside.</p> <p>Pat the prawns dry and mix them in a bowl with \u00bc teaspoon of salt, 1 tablespoon of oil and a good grind of black pepper.</p> <p>Put 2 teaspoons of oil into a large frying pan and place on a high heat. Once hot, add the prawns in batches and fry for a minute on each side, until cooked through and nicely browned. Set each batch aside while you continue with the remaining prawns. When the sauce is ready, stir in the prawns and charred tomatoes and cook on a medium heat for about another 3 minutes, to heat through. Serve either straight from the pan or spoon into wide shallow bowls. Scoop out the cardamom pods before serving, if you like: they are there to flavour the dish rather than to be eaten. Dot with about half of the pesto and serve at once, with the lemon and remaining pesto in a bowl alongside.</p> <h2>Fish kofta with yogurt, sumac &amp; chilli </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"459248f9ee45481ad484f567e38bfa4d24557cb3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/459248f9ee45481ad484f567e38bfa4d24557cb3/186_1191_4808_4808/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fish kofta\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>These herb- and spice-packed kofta make a lovely starter, or a light meal in themselves, packed into a pita and served with a chopped salad. These can be made in advance \u2013 up to a day, if you like \u2013 up to the point where they are about to go into the oven.

Remove from the heat and set aside until completely cool.</p> <p>Put the fish into a food processor and pulse a few times until finely chopped but not a complete paste. Transfer to a large bowl and add the cooled onion mixture, chopped chilli, herbs, lemon zest, egg, fish spice mix, 2 teaspoons of sumac, 1 teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Mix well to combine, then, using your hands, shape the mixture into about 15 kofta: they should each be about 5cm wide and weigh about 65g.</p> <p>Put 2 tablespoons of oil into a large frying pan and place on a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the kofta in batches of 2 or 3 and fry for about 4 minutes, turning halfway through so that both sides are golden brown. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking tray and bake for 4 or 5 minutes, until just cooked through. Remove from the oven and set aside for 5 minutes or so, to slightly cool.</p> <p>To serve, spread the yogurt evenly between four serving plates and top each with 3 fish kofta, saving any extra for seconds. Sprinkle the kofta with the remaining teaspoon of sumac, the picked dill and sliced chilli. Drizzle over the last tablespoon of oil and serve, with a lemon wedge alongside.</p> <p><em>The Observer aims to publish recipes for fish rated as sustainable by the Marine Conservation Society\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.mcsuk.org/goodfishguide/search\" title=\"\">Good Fish Guide</a></em></p> <h2>Chicken shawarma pie</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"765ee97f517544ed0a76cb0f039a4c165b1c5220\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/765ee97f517544ed0a76cb0f039a4c165b1c5220/0_827_5068_5068/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chicken shawarma pie\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This is a wow of a pie.

Transfer to a parchment-lined baking tray and spread out so that they are not overlapping. Bake for 20 minutes, then increase the oven temperature to 220C fan/gas mark 9. Remove the tray from the oven, carefully flip over each potato slice, then return to the oven for another 10 minutes, or until golden. Remove from the oven and set aside until needed.</p> <p>Reduce the oven temperature to 180C fan/gas mark 6 again (or turn the oven off for now and preheat before baking).</p> <p>Put 15g of butter and 1\u00bd tablespoons of oil into a large saut\u00e9 pan and place on a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the onion and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened. Add the chicken and cook for about 10 minutes, until lightly brown, then add the stock, \u00bc teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Bring to the boil, then lower the heat to medium. Simmer gently for 25 minutes, or until the chicken is just cooked through. Increase the heat to medium-high and continue to cook for about 8 minutes, or until the liquid has thickened and reduced to about 4 tablespoons. Remove from the heat and leave to cool for about 10 minutes, then use two forks to shred the chicken into large chunks.

Line the base of a 23cm springform cake tin with baking parchment and lightly grease the sides with the butter mixture. Lay a sheet of filo out on a clean work surface and brush with the butter. Transfer this to the tin so that the base is covered and the filo rises up and over the tin\u2019s sides. Repeat with the next sheet of filo, brushing it first with butter, then arranging it in the tin, rotating it slightly so that the excess hangs at a different angle. Continue in this fashion, brushing each piece generously as you go, until you have used up 6 pieces of filo in total and the base and sides are all covered.</p> <p>Next, add the potato slices, overlapping slightly, so that the base of the pie is completely covered. Top with the chicken mixture and gently push down to even out. Lastly, spoon over the tahini sauce, spreading it gently to coat the chicken layer. Brush a piece of filo with butter and fold it in half horizontally,like a book. Place this over the tahini layer, tucking in the filo around the filling. Brush the top with the butter mixture, then repeat with the last piece of filo, angling it to cover any exposed areas. Now fold over the overhang, crinkling up the filo to create a nice crumpled effect on the top. Brush the top with the remaining butter, sprinkle with the nigella seeds, place on a tray and bake</p> <h2>Filo triangles with cream cheese, pistachio &amp; rose \u2013 warbat</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a763b94a9193e7546a1cf997f6d762b75d60ac3a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a763b94a9193e7546a1cf997f6d762b75d60ac3a/0_0_5044_6996/721.jpg\" alt=\"Filo triangles with cream cheese, pistachio and rose.\" width=\"721\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Warbat is a popular snack during the month of Ramadan. The filling is traditionally made with ishta \u2013 a kind of thick, silky cream \u2013 which is then drizzled with rose water or rose water syrup.

Put 55ml of water and the sugar into a small saucepan and place on a medium-high heat. Mix well using a wooden spoon, then, once it starts boiling, add the lemon juice. Simmer gently for 2 minutes, then stir in the rose water and remove from the heat straightaway. Set aside.</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 180C fan/gas mark 6.</p> <p>To make the filling, put the cream cheese, cornflour, sugar, salt and mastic (or vanilla bean paste) into a medium bowl and whisk well to combine.</p> <p>To assemble, spread one filo sheet out on a work surface and brush evenly with some of the melted butter. Top with another sheet and brush with butter again. Repeat the process until you have 5 layers evenly brushed with butter. As is always the case when working with filo, you\u2019ll need to work fast when you start brushing and folding: the pastry will dry out if you don\u2019t. You should have used about a quarter of the melted butter at this stage.</p> <p>Using sharp scissors, cut the layered sheet of pastry into 6 squares, all 12cm x 12cm \u2013 you\u2019ll need to trim the sheets to get even squares. Taking one square at a time, spoon about 35g (or 2 tablespoons) of the thick filling into the centre of each square, leaving a 2-3cm border around the edge. Fold the pastry diagonally in half to form a triangle, press on the edges without reaching the filling (so that it stays well sealed within the pastry), then brush all over with more butter. Once all 6 triangle pastries are on a parchment-lined baking tray, repeat the whole process (brushing one large filo sheet with butter, layering it 5 times, cutting it into 6 squares, filling and folding and sealing each square) with the remaining pastry, butter and filling.</p> <p>Once all 12 pastries are made up and spread on two parchment-lined baking trays, bake for 22 minutes or until golden and crisp: some of them will pop open, but that\u2019s OK. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool for 10 minutes. Drizzle over the syrup, sprinkle over the crushed pistachios and rose petals, if using, and serve.</p> <p><em>Falastin: A Cookbook by Sami Tamimi and Tara Wigley (Ebury, \u00a328).

  "<p>Here\u2019s an example of Matthew Dooley\u2019s sense of humour. A while ago, the 35-year-old graphic novelist realised that Mervyn King, the erstwhile governor of the Bank of England, shared his name not only with the world\u2019s fourth-best darts player but also a high-ranking lawn and indoor bowler, whose day job was as a pest controller.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know many famous Mervyns but there were three Mervyn Kings who were, relatively speaking, at the top of their game at the same time,\u201d says Dooley, his eyes wide with wonder. \u201cIt was my greatest idea for a comic, which I\u2019ll almost certainly never do. I thought they could live together \u2013 all of their correspondence getting mixed up with hilarious consequences. I was going to call it <em>We Three Kings</em>.\u201d</p> <p>Dooley, who has vivid flame-red hair, glasses and a dense beard, has a weakness for puns. His favourite page of his wonderful, elegiac debut graphic novel, <em>Flake</em>, which is out next month, is one where two characters visit an amusement arcade in a northern seaside town. It\u2019s called Lancashire Hot Slot.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e1e212249b6a25599cb5f2b799cfdb066050768\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e1e212249b6a25599cb5f2b799cfdb066050768/0_354_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matthew Dooley at his London home\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matthew Dooley at his London home: \u2018I like people or characters who are obsessed by something.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Flake</em> tells the story of two rival ice-cream men: Howard, who is meek and happiest hiding in his van doing the crossword; and Tony Augustus \u2013 Howard\u2019s half-brother, as it happens \u2013 who is intent on building an empire across the region. It is set in the 1980s in the fictional town of Dobbiston, though Dooley admits that it shares much in common with Ormskirk, Lancashire, where he grew up.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s something wonderfully optimistic about trying to sell ice-cream in the north of England,\u201d says Dooley, when we meet at an ice-cream parlour in south London, not far from where he now lives, on a blustery afternoon in late January. \u201cIt\u2019s also, I guess, a lonely sort of job. I\u2019m not going to pretend it is some great allegory for big capitalist companies coming in and taking over the little man. Or it\u2019s about being an entrepreneur or anything like that. It\u2019s not. It was an opportunity to make up some ice-creams, which was quite fun.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c56efa42faa07810f7d0efdb855b51701044be6c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c56efa42faa07810f7d0efdb855b51701044be6c/346_321_2822_4085/691.jpg\" alt=\"Flake, a graphic novel by Matthew Dooley icelols\" width=\"691\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This means more puns: Dooley is particularly fond of one of Howard\u2019s bestsellers, the Lemony Licker. On another page, he has drawn an assortment of designs for ice-cream vans. I compliment him on one named Walt Whipman: \u201cThanks,\u201d says Dooley. \u201cThat\u2019s very much my favourite one.\u201d</p> <p>Dooley also clarifies that <em>Flake</em> has no connection with the Glasgow ice-cream wars of the 1980s, where a turf war kicked off between criminal organisations who were selling drugs mainly from the vans. \u201cI only read about that afterwards,\u201d he says. \u201cMine is a bit more gentle.\u201d</p> <p>Dooley\u2019s break in comics came in 2016 when he won the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/06/observer-jonathan-cape-comica-graphic-short-story-2016-winner-runner-up\" title=\"\">Observer/Jonathan Cape/Comica graphic short story prize</a>. His entry was titled Colin Turnbull: A Tall Story, and told the tale of a man whose main ambition in life was to win Lancashire\u2019s Tallest Milkman competition. There are some clear parallels between the two works: both Colin and Howard are doing jobs that their fathers did before them (and perhaps even their grandfathers before that). They are warm, affectionate, even nostalgic stories of professions and values that are no longer so common.</p> <p>\u201cThey are the first two parts of the dairy trilogy,\u201d says Dooley, before clarifying that he\u2019s joking and he has no immediate plans to return to milk or its by-products as a subject any time soon.</p> <p>Dooley, who spends his weekends playing lawn bowls at Wimbledon Park bowls club, doesn\u2019t deny that there\u2019s something of himself in these anachronistic creations. \u201cI like people or characters \u2013 and I see this in myself as well \u2013 who are obsessed by something that other people don\u2019t care about,\u201d he says. \u201cNow, I like ice-cream, and I would not want to say ice-cream is mundane, because it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s wonderful. But the inherent naffness of an ice-cream van, the way it\u2019s painted, it\u2019s the mix of the absurd and the mundane.\u201d</p> <p>Previously in the <em>Observer</em>, Dooley was described as a meld of Alan Bennett and the American <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/28/i-envy-writers-who-suffer-from-no-self-doubts-inside-the-world-of-graphic-novelist-chris-ware\" title=\"\">comic-book artist Chris Ware</a>. He modestly deflects the compliment. \u201cChris Ware is one of the great visual artists working in any medium,\u201d says Dooley. \u201cHe has a meticulous, beautiful style and I have quite a plain, flat style, so it\u2019s similar in a way. But he\u2019s much, much better at drawing than I am. And Alan Bennett, he quite likes the mundane and minutiae. But I wince at comparisons like that.\u201d</p> <p>Despite his protests, Dooley, who fits his drawing around working in the House of Commons in the education department, does share a sensibility with Ware, Bennett and also Tom Gauld. \u201cMy partner said she struggles to tell the difference in my work between something that is funny and something that is sad,\u201d says Dooley. \u201cAnd that\u2019s true; there are lots of bits that could be taken as either. But no, it is ultimately meant to be funny \u2026 I hope.\u201d</p> <p><em>Flake (Jonathan Cape, \u00a318.99) is published on 2 April</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"054f74534c6712a969ce658e2baee51431640670\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/054f74534c6712a969ce658e2baee51431640670/236_2756_3272_1963/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flake, a graphic novel by Matthew Dooley\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>",
  "<p>I am a chef, but I don\u2019t \u201ccook\u201d that much. I shop really well and pretty much \u201cput together\u201d. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m lazy; come Sunday and I\u2019m cooking a ragu, or a roast chicken then stock with the carcass for the freezer, and so on. But as a working mum, I have to cut corners. I soak beans the night before for a soup with herby courgettes. I\u2019ll keep polenta ready to fry. A green tea cake with rhubarb will take a little time, but is an easy pudding-like cake. It\u2019s delicious served warm, so make it before dinner and place it in the oven while you\u2019re eating. When the spring blossom is out and the sun lasts longer these are the kind of gorgeous dishes I want to put on the table.</p> <h2>Fried polenta with broad beans</h2> <p>This would also be delicious with a runny egg or roasted tomatoes. <br><em>Serves 4</em></p> <p><strong>butter</strong> 25g, plus extra for the tin<br><strong>water </strong>750ml, salted<br><strong>polenta</strong> 250g<br><strong>parmesan</strong> 50g, grated, plus extra to serve<br><strong>broad beans </strong>1 kg (in shells) or 350g frozen beans<br><strong>olive oil<br>garlic </strong>2 cloves, thinly sliced<br><strong>baby spinach </strong>250g, washed<br><strong>salt </strong>and<strong> pepper<br>chilli flakes </strong>1 tsp<br><strong>thyme</strong> 3 sprigs<br><strong>lemon </strong>1, cut into 4 wedges<br><strong>extra virgin olive oil</strong></p> <p>Butter a 21 x 11 x 7cm loaf tin and set aside. Bring the salted water to a boil, add the polenta and cook until it is thick and clings to the spoon \u2013 about 10 minutes, but it will vary, so always check the instructions on the packet. Stir in the parmesan and butter until you have a smooth mixture. Pour the soft polenta mixture into the prepared tin and leave to cool and set for half an hour. This will keep for up to 5 days in the fridge.</p> <p>Have a bowl of ice water ready. Pod the beans if you are using fresh and bring a small saucepan of salted water to the boil. Drop the beans into the pan and cook for about 2 minutes, until they start to float. Drain the beans and add to the ice water, if the water has warmed up from the beans you can refresh the ice water. You can pop the skins off any larger beans, though this is more of a preference. Put the cold beans into a bowl, toss with a little olive oil and set aside.</p> <p>Heat a frying pan with 2 tbsp of olive oil, add the garlic and thyme and cook on a medium heat until the garlic begins to colour. Drop in the spinach and cook for a couple of minutes until wilted, stirring constantly. Season with salt, pepper and chilli flakes. Drizzle with oil, turn off the heat and leave the pan on the hob so it stays warm.</p> <p>Heat a nonstick or seasoned cast iron frying pan with 1 tbsp of olive oil and slice the polenta into 8. Fry until golden on each side (you may need more oil as you go). If you are using a smaller pan, you can keep the polenta warm in the oven.</p> <p>Divide the spinach between the plates, removing the thyme sprigs, and top with 2 slices of polenta. Spoon over the broad beans, drizzle with olive oil and finish with grated parmesan.

When I was a child I loved his films, which they\u2019d show on TV on Saturday mornings. In <em>Steamboat Bill, Jr</em>, the facade of a house falls down on Keaton, who escapes with his life simply because an open window is strategically positioned to pass over his body as the facade comes down. McQueen takes Keaton\u2019s place and repeats the shot from different angles. In his short <em>Five Easy Pieces</em>, he films a group of black men hula hooping; as they move, their shadows seem to be acting independently of them, like ghosts. In both works, your emotions shift as the perspective changes, from fear to desire and joy.</p> <h2>3.

This year I attended an incredible tribute to the late, great African-American novelist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/06/toni-morrison-obituary\" title=\"\">Toni Morrison</a>. A stellar lineup of women writers described her legacy and influence on their work. The panel was chaired by Afua Hirsch and included Victoria Adukwei Bulley, Margaret Busby, Diana Evans and Phyll Opoku-Gyimah, with readings from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2016/jan/11/the-bluest-eye-toni-morrison-review\" title=\"\"><em>The Bluest Eye</em></a> by Jade Anouka and Kelechi Okafor.

  "<p>There has been a huge difference in how the coronavirus pandemic has evolved in different countries. Some have gone nearly two months with just a few dozen cases; others have seen an outbreak explode in weeks.</p> <p>The statistics about the early evolution of cases can be confusing, because some countries were slow to test or late to announce results. Italy\u2019s first case was at the end of January, but the disease is thought to have been circulating there from the middle of the month. Likewise the steep rise of cases in Iran suggests it was spreading long before the first positive test.</p> <p>Many of the countries that have had the greatest success in containing the disease are ones that were affected by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/24/lessons-from-sars-outbreak-help-in-race-for-coronavirus-vaccine\" title=\"\">Sars in 2002-03</a>. The memory of that crisis may have led to better preparedness, in government and among the population, and to a greater willingness among people to comply with restrictions on movement and daily life to prevent the spread of infection.</p> <p>There are three main aspects to controls that aim to stop the spread of the disease. The first is travel bans on people from areas with high levels of cases (initially mainland China, now many more places); the second is quarantine rules to prevent known or suspected carriers from spreading infection; and the third is shutdowns and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/coronavirus-uk-action-plan-poised-for-social-distancing-phase\" title=\"\">social distancing</a> to prevent transmission between unidentified carriers by reducing human contact.</p> <p>Below we take a look at some of the worst-affected countries, and the most successful at containing coronavirus so far. China has not been included, because its circumstances are an outlier. But it is another example of how quarantine requirements, and strict controls on movement and social interaction, can dramatically curb the spread of the disease. On Friday it had only eight new cases, the first time that number has fallen into single digits since the outbreak began.</p> <p>Initially, Italy did little to stop the spread of coronavirus. After it registered more deaths than any other country outside China, and the scale of the crisis became clear, it locked down first the northern region at the centre of the crisis and then the entire country.</p> <p>Schools and universities have closed, along with all shops except supermarkets and pharmacies. Restaurants and bars are closed to customers, although they can make home deliveries. Sports events and outdoor gatherings are banned.</p> <p>Permission is required if travel is vital for medical, work or personal reasons.</p> <h2>Iran</h2> <p>After announcing the first cases (and deaths) in late February, Iran did nothing about coronavirus \u2013 perhaps because the government felt it could not afford to offend China, a vital partner for the isolated country. Flights between Iran and China continued, and Iran donated a million face masks to China. Even after the toll began to rise rapidly, and senior politicians tested positive, health workers in small hospitals did not initially use protective gear.</p> <p>Now schools have been closed and most Friday prayer services are cancelled. People have been urged to self-isolate, and the government has warned it may use force to prevent internal travel. The country has dug mass graves to bury the dead.</p> <h2>South Korea</h2> <p>The country\u2019s most important tool in fighting coronavirus has been its testing system; South Korea has run far more tests per capita than any other country \u2013 and nearly 10 times more than in the UK.</p> <p>Many of those tested are members of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/28/were-treated-like-criminals-south-korean-sect-feels-coronavirus-backlash\" title=\"\">Shincheonji religious sect</a>, whose members in Daegu city account for more than half of cases. There are 53 drive-through testing stations, allowing people to check their illness without physical contact.</p> <p>Other measures include cancelling major events, and asking people to stay away from Daegu. The start of a new school term has been delayed from 2 March to the 22nd. Emergency childcare in classes of no more than 10 is offered for those who must go to work. Home working has been encouraged, with subsidies for companies that offer employees the flexibility to manage new care responsibilities.</p> <p>GPS maps, available online to the public, track the movements of anyone confirmed to have the virus. South Korea also screens passengers leaving the country.</p> <p>Widespread testing meant a jump in confirmed cases, currently more than 7,800, but resulted in a very low mortality rate, below 1%. New daily cases are down from a peak two weeks ago, and on Friday the country reported more recoveries than new cases, for the first time since the outbreak began.</p> <h2>Taiwan</h2> <p>Despite its closeness to China, physically and in economic terms, Taiwan has had extraordinary success in controlling the coronavirus. Efforts may have been helped by the Sars experience, and the fact that the vice-president is an epidemiologist.</p> <p>Taiwan was probably the first country to try to stop coronavirus spreading, bringing in checks on travellers from Wuhan at the end of December, after reports of a mystery, pneumonia-like illness.</p> <p>A command centre for epidemics kicked into action in late January, producing new policies and monitoring virus-tracking and treatment efforts. Wider travel restrictions on people coming from mainland China were introduced despite the insistence of the World Health Organization (WHO) that they were not necessary. Extensive testing and contact-tracing through the public health system prevented the disease spreading.</p> <p>School holidays were extended during late February, and schools can be closed again if cases emerge among students.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4fa72a3c122fbcdaa95af406c835b453c358ff76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fa72a3c122fbcdaa95af406c835b453c358ff76/0_334_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coronavirus testing in a laboratory in Singapore.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coronavirus testing in a laboratory in Singapore.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Edgar Su/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Singapore</h2> <p>Travel restrictions on people coming from mainland China were put in place, going beyond WHO advice. An exhaustive testing regime covered anyone with flu-like or pneumonia symptoms. All possible contacts of those infected were tracked, involving the police, flight manifests and a local test for antibodies that circulate after an infection clears.</p> <p>Tests are free, and a huge public information campaign has urged even people with mild symptoms to see a doctor. The government covers medical bills for suspected or confirmed cases, so there are no financial risks to getting tested.</p> <p>Self-employed people get a quarantine allowance, and employers are banned from deducting days in isolation from annual leave.</p> <p>Measures can also be punitive, with one couple prosecuted for providing false travel history.</p> <h2>Hong Kong</h2> <p>Most border crossings with mainland China have been closed, and people arriving from there must quarantine for 14 days.</p> <p>Schools and universities closed in mid-January, and most remain shut, although a few private schools have partly reopened. Working from home has been encouraged where possible. Museums and sports facilities are shut, and people told to avoid large gatherings.</p> <p>Those with strong memories of Sars have voluntarily stayed home when they can, and used masks and hand sanitiser when they have to go out.</p> <p>The measures have also brought a drop in seasonal flu cases.</p>",
  "<p>Ten years ago, James Rogers was driving through some of the most productive farmland on the planet, thinking about food. He had recently read an article detailing the challenges of feeding the world\u2019s growing population, and as he gazed out over the fertile fields of the Salinas Valley outside Monterey, California, he thought: how is it possible that people go hungry, that people starve, when growing food seems so simple? \u201cYou just take these magic beans and...\u201d Rogers, recalling the thought, casts his hand as if tossing seed on the ground. \u201cI realise it\u2019s a bit more complicated than that, but, still\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Back then, Rogers was a PhD student in material sciences at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). He wasn\u2019t working in anything food-related at all. His PhD research involved creating a kind of paint that, when dried, turned into a solar panel. There was a lab up in Berkeley that had the equipment necessary for his studies, but between the lab and his home in Santa Barbara, he passed the farmland, and the food problem gnawed at him. He wondered if it wasn\u2019t merely as simple as he supposed. He began taking classes in environmental economics and natural resources. He learned that, globally, we are indeed producing more than enough food. The problem isn\u2019t production, it\u2019s what happens next.</p> <p>We waste an extraordinary amount of food. In America it\u2019s about 40%; in the UK, nearly the same. Around the world, almost a third of all the food produced \u2013 approximately 1.3bn tonnes \u2013 is lost one way or another each year. Much of the time it\u2019s not merely lost, but brought into our homes only to be chucked in the bin, and then transported to a landfill, where it slowly releases methane back into the atmosphere, actively warming the Earth. Worldwide, a staggering 10% of all greenhouse gas emissions are linked to food waste. The question for Rogers was: what exactly was driving so much waste?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"46b4dc549a0062ba01d7159c3bc59bfcc1b15d22\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46b4dc549a0062ba01d7159c3bc59bfcc1b15d22/868_396_2542_4476/568.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018When I can go pick up local Apeel strawberries in the summer and have them last until winter in my fridge, that\u2019s when I know we\u2019ll have made it\u2019: James Rogers, CEO of Apeel.\" width=\"568\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018When I can go pick up local Apeel strawberries in the summer and have them last until winter in my fridge, that\u2019s when I know we\u2019ll have made it\u2019: James Rogers, CEO of Apeel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jesse Chehakver/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One day, while researching, he came across another article. He can still recall its first line: \u201cAll fresh produce is seasonal as well as perishable.\u201d That insight \u2013 so simple, so true \u2013 struck him like a lightning bolt. \u201cThe problem,\u201d he recalls, \u201cis you\u2019re either in season and have more than you know what to do with, or you have nothing.\u201d Plenty of animals have adapted to these natural cycles of boom and bust, fat times and lean: birds migrate, bears hibernate. Humans trade, converting this surplus into a non-perishable asset we call money. Some of the earliest forms of currency were, in fact, grains stored in clay pots. And clay pottery, Rogers is quick to point out, was one of material science\u2019s very first breakthroughs. Clay pottery allowed us to continue eating long after the harvest. But clay pottery only got us so far. It was what material science might offer food today that interested him.</p> <p>He decided, then, to switch tracks. No longer would he work on paint that dried into solar panels. He would instead begin to work on increasing the shelf life of fruit and vegetables. Eventually, he developed a substance that wasn\u2019t entirely dissimilar from the solar paint. This substance, however, was made entirely out of plant lipids, or fatty acids. Spray it on to an avocado, say, and the substance dries into a sort of second skin, which increases the avocado\u2019s shelf life by two to three times.</p> <p>The company Rogers founded, <a href=\"https://apeelsciences.com/\" title=\"\">Apeel Sciences</a>, is currently growing by hundreds of employees a year, backed by tens of millions of dollars in venture capital, and is revolutionising entire food systems and economies. But back then, in 2010, driving past those fertile fields, it was still early days. Rogers remembers calling his mother and telling her the news about his insight \u2013 the big switch in his interests and research. \u201cSweetie,\u201d she said to him. \u201cThat sounds really nice. But you don\u2019t know anything about fruit and vegetables.\u201d</p> <p>Apeel Sciences is headquartered in Goleta, California, just north of UCSB and south of farmland that quickly gives way to the rural, rolling Central California coast. The company\u2019s 100,000 sq ft building was formerly home to a medical-device maker and the labs and clean rooms easily swapped from their previous purpose \u2013 building prototypes for entry into the human body \u2013 to their current one: the study of the molecular structures of fruit\u2019s skin.</p> <p>\u201cThis room is part of our food-manufacturing practice,\u201d says Molly Greathouse, who is giving me a tour. We peer in, but the lab is dark and empty and appears abandoned. \u201cIt\u2019s still being set up,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re still putting wires into things.\u201d Her colleague, Daniel Costanza, is my other guide. Both are recent hires, but recent is relative: Apeel\u2019s employee count rose in the past six months from 130 to more than 200, so Greathouse, who has been here for nearly a year-and-a-half, counts as a seasoned veteran.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'This is the type of technology you look back on as revolutionary. I hold it up there with electricity or the internet'</p> <footer> <cite>Daniel Costanza</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We pass another lab, a clean room that houses, among other bacteria, E coli and listeria. The lights are on, and along one wall is another big door topped by a glowing red light. Here, Greathouse says, is where Apeel\u2019s scientists put fruit and vegetables through a battery of tests mimicking conditions they might face while in transit. What happens when refrigeration shuts down? What happens when a contaminated batch of food is nearby, hence the reason for the dangerous bacteria. There are cascading effects to prolonging the shelf life of produce.</p> <p>Costanza describes how one of the suppliers they work with no longer uses plastic wrap on cucumbers now that Apeel\u2019s spray is in the mix. It\u2019s a seemingly small change that quickly adds up. In a single year, that one move will save enough plastic wrap to enfold the Empire State Building 11 times over. \u201cImagine adding that to each food category throughout the globe,\u201d Costanza says. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge paradigm shift away from single-use plastics. It\u2019s pretty crazy.\u201d Costanza drops his voice, getting serious. \u201cThis is the type of technology you look back on as revolutionary. I hold it up there with electricity or the internet. There are so many lives we can affect in a positive way. And we have such tight intellectual property no one\u2019s really able to replicate it \u2013 we don\u2019t really have competition.\u201d</p> <p>They do, really. There\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.hazeltechnologies.com/\" title=\"\">Hazel Technologies</a>, which is based in Chicago and makes little packets that get stashed in produce boxes. The packets alter the atmosphere within the box, slowing the food\u2019s response to ethylene, a chemical that fruit and vegetables emit as they age that causes a breakdown in colour and texture. A similar company in the UK, called <a href=\"https://www.itsfresh.com/\" title=\"\">It\u2019s Fresh</a>, makes ethylene filters, too, and recently received a $10m investment from <a href=\"https://www.agrofresh.com/\" title=\"\">AgroFresh</a>, a company that sells a dozen or so products including fungicides and wax coatings, all of which aim to prolong produce shelf life and enhance their look.</p> <p>There\u2019s also Cambridge Crops, from Massachusetts, which makes a similar edible protective coating to Apeel, using silk proteins rather than plant lipids. Cambridge Crops received $4m in seed funding from the MIT venture fund last year, whereas Apeel recently landed $70m from the Silicon Valley fund Andreessen Horowitz, which has famously backed Facebook, Twitter, Airbnb and Soylent, the meal-replacement drink company.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"30048d4d9dd2bb104aa8703e22f5e9c230bed203\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30048d4d9dd2bb104aa8703e22f5e9c230bed203/0_288_6516_3910/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shelf life: Apeel\u2019s HQ in California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shelf life: Apeel\u2019s HQ in California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jesse Chehak/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All of these companies and investors are making a play for a market worth at least $218bn in the US, and several times that worldwide. That number \u2013 $218bn \u2013 is about how much grocery stores, restaurants and people at home spend on food that simply gets thrown away per year, according to ReFed, a food waste-reduction nonprofit based in Berkeley, California. ReFed also estimates that, last year, venture capitalists invested about $185m in technologies to combat food waste.</p> <p>People have been trying to preserve fruit and vegetables for at least as long as they\u2019ve been putting grains in clay pots. We dry it in the sun (12,000 BC) or jam it (600 AD) or cure it (1400 AD), or cool it or can it, pasteurise it or vacuum seal it. The practice of coating a fruit in wax to seal its freshness and enhance its appearance is at least several centuries old, and today you\u2019d be hard pressed to find a supermarket apple without it. Today, wax seals also contain antifungal properties, which are perfectly safe, and are applied in so thin a layer as to be pretty much insignificant.</p> <p>What sets Apeel apart is its specific coating technology \u2013 the fact that it works more effectively than a wax and is an organic additive made from plant parts. That, and the company\u2019s comparatively huge cash influx from Silicon Valley, and its truly global reach. Apeel is already well on its way to spanning the globe. It has satellite offices in Mexico, Peru, the Netherlands and New Jersey, and it works with five different suppliers of avocados, including Del Monte and Del Rey, which are two of the largest. It also works with Sage Fruit, one of Washington state\u2019s largest organic apple growers.</p> <p>Greathouse and Costanza shepherd me past the analytical sciences lab, where the fruit is run through a series of taste and smell tests to make sure that the Apeel spray essentially disappears as soon as it\u2019s applied. This is a complex task. The spray can be made of the lipids from any plant \u2013 much of the source crop for their ingredients changes throughout the year, and is simply the excess or discarded produce from farms and vineyards \u2013 but it has to be molecularly reconstituted to act more or less exactly like the specific fruit on which it is sprayed.</p> <p>We arrive at yet another lab, this one home to the material sciences team \u2013 the beating heart of the Apeel operation. Here, they use liquid gases to separate specific molecules from the lipid slurry, then reconfigure those molecules into a variety of combinations, essentially highly educated hunches as to what a specific fruit or vegetable\u2019s skin might be like. If this seems like a lot of tedious guesswork, it is. The research and development for Apeel\u2019s first product, a coating for avocados, took eight years.</p> <p>Now we\u2019re in a bright room lined with racks of mouldering strawberries and bananas. Well, some are mouldering, some are not. Each rack has a camera mounted and set to a timer, to scan the fruit and track its breakdown. Some of the fruit has been sprayed with the Apeel spray, some has not. Tim, an engineer and overseer of the rotting fruit, apologises for the fruit fly situation in the room.</p> <p>Finally, our tour ends in a warehouse at the back of the building. The space is dominated by huge produce sorting and cleaning machines, rigged with a custom-made Apeel spray device that treats the fruit or vegetables at the very last step of the process.</p> <p>\u201cIt feels like moisturiser,\u201d Greathouse says, describing the spray. It is odourless and tasteless, too. Once, when Greathouse tried some of it on her hand, she thought, \u201cMaybe I can shave with this.\u201d In fact, she adds, \u201cThe reason we wrinkle is oxidation and moisture loss \u2013 same as fruit. I want to do an experiment with one half of my face on Apeel, one half not, and then see what happens.\u201d</p> <p>James Rogers, the CEO,<em><strong> </strong></em>has an office filled with avocados. Some are pillows, some figurines, some are squishy stress balls shaped like avocados, some are the genuine article. Rogers loves avos. \u201cThe joke with the av is: not now, not now, not now. Now? Too late,\u201d he says. But: \u201cWhen you get an Apeel avocado the joke no longer makes sense,\u201d because the fruit stays ripe for so long. The window to enjoy it, previously so fleeting, has been stretched by weeks. The one fruit he loves even more, though, is the strawberry. \u201cI know it\u2019s not sexy, but it\u2019s just my favourite,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd they go bad so quickly.\u201d The company is a few years into R&amp;D on that one. \u201cWhen I can go pick up local Apeel strawberries in the summer and have them last until winter in my fridge, that\u2019s when I know we\u2019ll have made it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"164cdd5714c278448bce7ed10019b119a8321f6b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/164cdd5714c278448bce7ed10019b119a8321f6b/169_0_4175_5529/755.jpg\" alt=\"Building the future: inside the lab at the Apeel.\" width=\"755\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Building the future: inside the lab at the Apeel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jesse Chehak/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These days, Rogers spends less time in material science and more on distribution chains. It turns out, when you create a new technology that extends the shelf life of produce, it creates another problem central to the whole business: who, exactly, does this create value for? The perishability of a fruit or veg dictates everything about its supply chain. Everything from when you pick it, right down to the season and the time of the day, to where it\u2019s packed, in the field or a packing shed. Is it then force air-cooled, or hydro-cooled? Does it travel down a flume or a conveyor belt? Does it go in a bag? Or does it get boxed? Does it go in a box with big holes or small holes? Does it go into a shipping container? Does it go into an aeroplane? Does it go into a display in the grocery store? When it goes home with you, does it go in the fridge? Or does it go on your counter?</p> <p>Within every supply chain for every different fruit or vegetable lies economic opportunity. The goal for each of Apeel\u2019s produce lines, Rogers says, is that the savings accrued by the growers or grocers are so great that you and I are actually paying less for their fruit and vegetables in the market. This is crucial, because \u2013 yes \u2013 while it\u2019s good for the environment and will cut down on waste, feeling good about what you buy can only rope in so many consumers; the rest, the real revolution, lies in sheer economic price cutting. A cheaper piece of fruit that will last four times as long? No one will pass that bargain up.</p> <p>Where things start to get truly interesting, from a market perspective, is how this opens up whole new avenues of produce to put in front of people. Just as perishability dictates everything about its supply chain, how well a fruit or vegetable travels is the most important characteristic of any mass-produced produce. The best example of this is the banana. Nearly every banana sold in supermarkets is a variety called the Cavendish. The Cavendish isn\u2019t particularly tasty, as banana varieties go. Nor is it especially packed with nutrients. There are far better bananas out there. But none travel \u2013 stay firm and unripe quite as long \u2013 like the Cavendish. Only, the Cavendish is falling victim to its own success, and a fungus is rampaging through this particular variety. So diversity in our produce isn\u2019t just a nice thing for us as eaters, it\u2019s essential for our future food security.</p> <p>Just up the road from Apeel\u2019s headquarters is a farm growing a strange kind of finger-shaped lime. When cut open, the flesh appears pearled, like caviar, which is why it\u2019s known as a caviar lime. The farm\u2019s caviar limes are a speciality item, trucked to high-end restaurants in LA and flown to New York for the same purpose. The limes last for 7-10 days after they\u2019ve been picked. But Apeel started working with the farm a few years ago, and was able to develop a spray that worked. A fruit with a shorter window of ripeness actually speeds up the development process, because you are able to quickly see what\u2019s working, and what\u2019s not. Now this fruit that was so highly specialised, appearing for just one weekend in a farmer\u2019s market, and in a few dishes in fancy restaurants, can be sold in supermarkets.</p> <p>The caviar limes weren\u2019t Rogers\u2019 idea. Some of his scientists became infatuated with the problem and went to work on it. But now, he sees how this might be the future: new fruit and heirloom vegetables: the weirder, more specialised, small-batch stuff, brought to the masses. The weird limes were actually the very first product Apeel brought to the market. \u201cThank God no one listened to me on that one,\u201d he says, smiling, thinking back on it. It taught him another important lesson, one he carries forward now. \u201cThe shorter the shelf life, the bigger the opportunity.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Confronted by the coronavirus menace, politicians and governments around the world are thrashing about wildly, trying to decide what to do for the best. \u201cPolitics isn\u2019t working\u201d is a common refrain among disaffected citizens in the modern era. But at this uniquely stressful moment, it really does appear to be true. While they mean well, most leaders haven\u2019t got a clue.</p> <p>The dawning realisation that national politicians cannot be relied upon to do the right or sensible thing, whatever that may turn out to be, has serious long-term implications for democracy and the principle of democratic consent. If the crisis is protracted, a catastrophic loss of confidence in the way the pandemic is managed could lead to unpredictable social disruption across many countries.</p> <p>As is the case with victims of the disease, underlying conditions and vulnerabilities in politics too are being painfully exposed.</p> <p>It\u2019s becoming clear, for example, that healthcare systems, even in wealthy countries such as the US, are chronically under-resourced and unprepared. Confusion reigns widely, fuelled by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/uk-governments-coronavirus-advice-and-why-it-gave-it\" title=\"\">conflicting official advice in different countries </a>about public gatherings, travel, and self-isolation.</p> <p>Some leaders may emerge with their reputations enhanced. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/11/donald-trump-us-coronavirus-address\" title=\"\">For others, the opposite holds true. </a>The virus has already made fools of the world\u2019s two most powerful men. Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president, has faced unprecedented criticism over his handling of the first recorded outbreak in Wuhan. He initially steered well clear of the problem \u2013 an early example of social distancing.</p> <p>But Xi has struggled since to contain the political and human fallout. The death from Covid-19 of Li Wenliang, a young doctor who sounded the alarm in Wuhan in December but was gagged by Communist party officials, sparked an online revolt. Xi finally ventured to the city last week, lavishing praise on its beleaguered residents in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/world/asia/coronavirus-china-xi-jinping.html\" title=\"\">what almost sounded like an apology</a>.</p> <p>Predictably, Donald Trump\u2019s reaction has been all about him. Among other inanities, he suggested the pandemic was a fake Democrat plot to harm his re-election chances. Ignoring the science and minimising the threat, he claimed his Mexican border wall had somehow immunised Americans, and likened the \u201cforeign virus\u201d to an alien invasion. It\u2019s embarrassingly obvious Trump is not up to the job.</p> <p>Both Trump and Xi could pay a heavy price. The US leader may have survived impeachment, but come November many voters will not forget or forgive this failure of leadership in a crisis. Xi\u2019s aura of paternal infallibility has shattered. Trust has gone. To restore his grip, it is suggested, he may resort to more intrusive social controls, surveillance and censorship. Yet increased repression could prompt a career-ending backlash.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s knee-jerk reaction in pulling up the drawbridge and blaming others is not unique. Fear not facts has led European leaders such as Austria\u2019s Sebastian Kurz to act alone, hastily <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/coronavirus-several-eu-states-ban-mass-events-after-italian-lockdown\" title=\"\">closing borders</a> and barring people from specific countries. These divisions recall Europe\u2019s chaotic response to the 2015 migrant crisis when governments failed to agree a collective approach.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b320fb642e353579aad3eef59b20532e1e147abd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b320fb642e353579aad3eef59b20532e1e147abd/0_147_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sebastian Kurz of Austria.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Acting alone\u2019: Sebastian Kurz of Austria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lisi Niesner/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the European Union, the pandemic is turning into a political nightmare. The commission in Brussels is struggling to keep up, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-eu/eu-to-give-states-spending-leeway-to-tackle-virus-fallout-on-economy-idUSKBN21016P\" title=\"\">relaxing rules</a> on deficit spending that have already been broken. Piecemeal, national-level policy-making is a gift to Eurosceptics, not least rightwing populists keen to exploit splits, and could have lasting consequences for European cohesion. Public confidence may take a big hit.</p> <p>There\u2019s no doubt politicians face genuine dilemmas. In Italy, Europe\u2019s worst-affected state, the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, was initially attacked for doing too much, by ordering widespread testing in Lombardy, and subsequently for doing too little. What is certain is that Italy has received little help from the rest of Europe \u2013 the subject of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/italy-criticises-eu-being-slow-help-coronavirus-epidemic\" title=\"\">bitter complaint</a> last week.</p> <p>Now that Italy is in total lockdown, it is being studied like a laboratory guinea pig. Boris Johnson, aware, like other leaders, that his reputation is at stake, treads a fine line between similarly drastic measures and \u201ckeep calm and carry on\u201d stoicism. If it all goes wrong, his defence will be that he followed medical advice. Suddenly, experts are back on top in Britain \u2013 if only as potential fall guys.</p> <p>Many look for leadership to Angela Merkel, Germany\u2019s unflappable chancellor and Europe\u2019s most respected politician. Yet her <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/world/europe/coronavirus-merkel-germany.html\" title=\"\">assessment</a> last week, that Covid-19 would infect two out of three Germans and there was not a lot governments could do about it, was less than reassuring.</p> <p>Merkel called for \u201csolidarity, common sense and open-heartedness\u201d. But her emphasis on Europe-wide cooperation carried a whiff of hypocrisy. Germany and France have limited exports of protective masks and equipment to safeguard domestic supply \u2013 hardly an act of solidarity with the neighbours. Nor is Berlin rushing to bail out floundering eurozone partners.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Looked at globally, the politicians\u2019 performance to date has been mostly unimpressive</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The parallel absence of an effective, joined-up global strategy is also casting multilateral institutions in an unflattering light. The World Health Organization, the lead UN agency that might be expected to wield decisive influence, appears strangely diffident at times \u2013 fearful, perhaps, of provoking a political backlash from heavy-hitters such as China.</p> <p>Global financial institutions are not doing any better. The IMF has <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2020/03/04/sp030420-imf-makes-available-50-billion-to-help-address-coronavirus\" title=\"\">thrown $50bn</a> at the problem. Interest rates have been randomly cut and emergency budgets announced. But compared with the 2008 financial crisis, when governments and central banks collaborated to stave off a banking collapse, international coordination to calm markets and reduce risk is lacking. Virus-related economic damage may thus be worse, and longer lasting, than might have been the case.</p> <p>Despite all the angst, the WHO\u2019s chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, complained about \u201calarming levels of inaction\u201d by politicians \u2013 and it seems many governments remain in denial. That may be due to vanity (in the case of North Korea\u2019s defiantly face-mask-free Kim Jong-un) or incapacity (in the case of poorer countries). Iran repeatedly denied it had a problem, until its leaders started dying. Now it is reportedly digging <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-iran-mass-graves-qom\" title=\"\">mass graves</a>.</p> <p>Unscrupulous politicians stand accused of using the pandemic as cover for furtive power-grabs. The timing of last week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/08/saudi-arabia-releases-images-king-salman-amid-purge-royals\" title=\"\">high-level purge</a> by Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, and a constitutional coup by Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, may be coincidental. Or maybe not.</p> <p>In Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu is manoeuvring to stay on as prime minister, despite his corruption trial and his lack of a parliamentary majority, in the face of what he now deems an exceptional national threat. It\u2019s conceivable Trump could use <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/us-launch-airstrike-iraq-retaliation-rocket-attack-killed-three-britain\" title=\"\">new clashes</a> with militia in Iraq to revive his Iran vendetta \u2013 and distract attention from his viral incompetence.</p> <p>The crisis also raises the danger of governments taking so-called temporary emergency powers and imposing sweeping, illiberal constraints on citizens, journalists and social media that subsequently become permanent. That\u2019s what happened after the 9/11 convulsion, when the US and allies decided to largely ignore international human rights protections in the name of fighting terrorism.</p> <p>Looked at globally, the politicians\u2019 performance to date has been mostly unimpressive. Yet the fundamental question raised by the pandemic is not one solely for them. It concerns each individual, community, and nation. Will the challenges posed by the virus be allowed to drive us further apart \u2013 or used to help bring us closer together? The answer hangs in the balance. It could go either way.</p>",
  "<p>A pandemic is testing global leadership and its capacity to rise to the challenge of \u201cthe worst public health crisis for a generation\u201d. To some surprise, the man who said that is addressing the emergency in a more mature fashion than many anticipated when it first began to unfold. Boris Johnson has abandoned the \u201cinvisible man\u201d act for which I mocked him a fortnight ago and located the serious side of his character. The pantomime Johnson has been retired from public spectacle and replaced with the sombre Johnson we now see at news conferences. At his most recent, he struck an appropriately sober tone when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/uk-moves-to-delay-phase-of-coronavirus-plan\" title=\"\">he warned</a>: \u201cI must level with the British public: many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time\u201d, words prime ministers usually don\u2019t expect to utter outside wartime. Candour, not a quality always associated with this prime minister, is essential. Fear, panic and conspiracy theories are fomented when people suspect that their leaders are not telling them the truth. The Opinium poll that we publish today suggests that more people than not have confidence in the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis, but the margin is not a very solid one.</p> <p>The prime minister has been flattered by comparison with Donald Trump. His multiple flaws are being pitilessly highlighted by a crisis that a man who does not believe in scientific evidence or international cooperation is hopelessly ill-equipped to handle. Variously dismissing the coronavirus as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/28/trump-calls-coronavirus-outbreak-a-hoax-and-links-it-to-immigration-at-rally\" title=\"\">a hoax</a>\u201d cooked up by his opponents to deny him re-election or no worse than the flu, he has swung from juvenile denialism to blaming it on foreigners and Democrats. Then he suddenly announced travel bans and declared a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/donald-trump-coronavirus-national-emergency\" title=\"\">\u201cnational emergency\u201d</a>.</p> <p>The ineffable American president is the quintessential example of a stretch of world history in which populist blowhards have prospered at the ballot box by stoking division, promoting polarisation, scorning expertise and championing ignorance. This crisis, one that now touches every continent on Earth apart from Antarctica, demands leaders who are willing to listen to professional advice, capable of fostering national cohesion at a time of emergency, and skilled at seeking international cooperation. The luckier countries will be those blessed with competent, honest and intelligent leadership. One of the possible positives to come out of this crisis \u2013 I put it no higher than possible at this stage \u2013 is that it will decrease the public appetite for bombastic charlatans and increase demand for serious leaders who respect expertise. If it does, that will be bad for populist hucksters more generally.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The hope is to reduce the scale of the spike and delay it to a warmer month so that the health service isn't overwhelmed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Mr Johnson has often aped Trumpian populism when he has seen political advantage in doing so, but he is smart enough to grasp that something more grown up is now required. People present at Cobra meetings and other decision-making moments generally report being impressed by the way he conducts himself. I asked one witness, who is not an instinctive cheerleader for this prime minister, how they thought he was doing. The reply came: \u201cPretty well. He is listening intently to the science.\u201d In this respect, Dominic Cummings, his chief adviser and a fervent admirer of science, is acting as a positive influence on the prime minister, rather than a baleful one. Whenever he addresses the country from the state dining room, he has come flanked by Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, and Professor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer. Thrust into the spotlight in a way neither man can have anticipated, they have both impressed with the clear and calm way they have talked to the nation. They can explain the reasoning for the strategy and how it is evolving with much more credibility than any politician. The polls tell us they will be much more likely to be believed. The government\u2019s senior scientists also serve as the prime minister\u2019s human shields against accusations that he is acting out of ideological fixations or for partisan advantage. No wonder he is clinging to them.</p> <p>The past few days have brought both more clarity and more controversy about their strategy. There is still consensus around one key component \u2013 to try to spread out the rate of infection: \u201cflattening the peak\u201d. The hope is to reduce the scale of the spike and delay it to a warmer month so that the health service is not overwhelmed with patients requiring critical care. In his budget, an event all but eclipsed by the crisis, Rishi Sunak promised the NHS \u201cwhatever it takes\u2026 millions or billions\u201d to tackle the coronavirus, but you can\u2019t spend that money overnight. The NHS needs to increase its intensive care capacity, but that requires more staff, more equipment and more time. The crisis in Italy, whose leadership was slow to realise that they had a problem and who have now imposed an almost total lockdown of the entire country, has shocked ministers. It is widely assumed that Britain is about four weeks behind Italy in terms of infection, though that doesn\u2019t mean we have to end up in the same grisly place.</p> <p>There is not consensus, but mounting controversy, about another critical element of the government\u2019s strategy. Britain has adopted a strikingly different approach to the many other countries that are implementing faster and more sweeping programmes to curtail human contact. These include Ireland, France and Belgium, all close neighbours.</p> <p>That has fuelled the rising pressure on the prime minister to take much more stringent steps here. The pressure is coming both from Labour and from within the government\u2019s own ranks. Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary, has been the loudest voice asking why we are not seeking to emulate Asian states, such as Singapore and South Korea, that seem to have had some success in snuffing out the spread of the virus.</p> <p>The government is moving towards banning sports fixtures and other mass gatherings, but is still resistant to a more comprehensive shutdown. The scientific reasoning behind Britain\u2019s approach is that more draconian steps won\u2019t make that much difference at this stage, are not sustainable over the longer term, and may well turn out to be counterproductive because it will lead to a second wave of infections when restrictions are eased \u2013 possibly in winter, when the NHS is most stretched.</p> <p>Sir Patrick has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-science-chief-defends-uk-measures-criticism-herd-immunity\" title=\"\">lucidly explained</a> what the strategy is designed to achieve. It expects those on whom the disease has mild effects, the great majority, to be gradually exposed to the virus, building up \u201cherd immunity\u201d. Over time, this will lower the risk of infection for the vulnerable. While this is going on, they will do what they can to protect those for whom the coronavirus could be fatal. Perhaps the most important advice given by the government last week was the simplest. That was to tell people who have flu-type symptoms, however slight, that they should stay at home for seven days. \u201cThat\u2019s not trivial,\u201d says one of those involved in this decision. \u201cThat is a significant amount of social distancing.\u201d</p> <p>Faced with an invisible menace with extremely visible impacts, a clamour for instant and total shutdowns is understandable. But it comes accompanied by the danger that kneejerk responses by frantic governments can end up doing more harm than good. One scientist drew my attention to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/04/japan-lifts-evacuation-order-futaba-town-fukushima-disaster\" title=\"\">Fukushima</a> nuclear plant disaster in Japan in 2011. Later studies found that around 20 people died from radiation. Many more, about a thousand, lost their lives as a result of the decision to evacuate: casualties of car crashes, heart attacks and other medical emergencies triggered by trying to clear the area in a rush. Sometimes the obvious reaction to a crisis will not be the correct one.</p> <p>Many lives depend on getting this right. The government can\u2019t be blamed for the virus, but there will be fierce scrutiny of its responses. There are risks with the strategy it has adopted \u2013 and huge ones for the reputation of Mr Johnson if the public concludes that his handling of the crisis led to avoidable deaths. There are hazards, too, with the alternative approaches. Various models for tackling the pandemic are now being live trialled around the world by governments of many different complexions and levels of competence. It will likely be a year or so before we will gain an understanding of which of the plans was the smartest. My conversations have convinced me that the British approach is rooted in scientific logic and a careful calibration of the different risks. I\u2019m no epidemiologist so I won\u2019t pretend to be a qualified judge of whether they are doing the right thing. I am persuaded that they are sincerely endeavouring to do the right thing.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</p>",
  "<p>The selfish gene. The Big Bang. The greenhouse effect. Metaphors are at the heart of scientific thinking. They provide the means for both scientists and non-scientists to understand, think through and talk about abstract ideas in terms of more familiar objects or phenomena.</p> <p>But if metaphors can illuminate, they can also constrain. In his new book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-idea-of-the-brain-9781781255896.html\" title=\"\"><em>The </em><em>Idea of the Brain</em></a>, zoologist and historian Matthew Cobb tells the story of how scientists and philosophers have tried to understand the brain and how it works. In every age, Cobb shows, people have thought about the brain largely in terms of metaphors, drawn usually from the most exciting technology of the day, whether clocks or telephone exchanges or the contemporary obsession with computers. The brain, Cobb observes, \u201cis more like a computer than like a clock\u201d, but \u201ceven the simplest animal brain is not a computer like anything we have built, nor one we can yet envisage\u201d.</p> <p>Metaphors allow \u201cinsight and discovery\u201d but are \u201cinevitably partial\u201d and \u201cthere will come a point when the understanding they allow will be outweighed by the limits they impose\u201d. We may, Cobb suggests, be at that point in picturing the brain as a computer.</p> <p>The paradox of neuroscience today is that we possess an unprecedented amount of data about the brain but barely a glimmer of a theory to explain how it works. Indeed, as the French neuroscientist Yves Fr\u00e9gnac has put it, making ample use of metaphor, it can feel as if \u201cwe are drowning in a flood of information\u201d and that \u201call sense of global understanding [of brain function] is in acute danger of being washed away\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just in science that metaphors are significant in shaping the ways in which we think. In 1980, the linguist George Lakoff and philosopher Mark Johnson set off the modern debate on this issue with their seminal work, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Metaphors-We-Live-George-Lakoff/dp/0226468372/ref=dp_ob_title_bk\" title=\"\"><em>Metaphors We Live By</em></a>. Metaphors, they argued, are not linguistic flourishes but the fundamental building blocks of thought. We don\u2019t simply talk or write with metaphors, we also think with them.</p> <p>It\u2019s a view fiercely contested by other psychologists and linguists. But even critics don\u2019t deny the significance of metaphors. There is an episode of <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em> in which the Starship Enterprise encounters an alien race called the Tamarians who speak only in <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/06/star-trek-tng-and-the-limits-of-language-shaka-when-the-walls-fell/372107/\" title=\"\">metaphors and allegories</a>. The Earthlings find it very difficult to communicate. Humans are not Tamarians. Nevertheless, there are few areas of life in which metaphoric use is not deeply embedded. Some studies suggest that one word in every 25 we use is a metaphor. And there is much evidence that the choice of metaphor can shape the way we perceive the world and act upon it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Social and political discusses are steeped in metaphors from 'trickle-down economics' to the 'red wall'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In a series of experiments, two psychologists, Paul Thibodeau and Lera Boroditsky, gave participants one of two reports about crime in the <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016782\" title=\"\">fictional city of Addison</a>. The reports were identical, except that in one crime was described as a \u201cwild beast preying on the city\u201d and in the other as a \u201cvirus infecting the city\u201d. When asked for solutions, those who read the first report suggested mostly tougher law enforcement and punishments, while those presented with the second were more willing to propose social reforms such as economic or healthcare improvements. Participants who identified as Republicans were 8-9% more likely to favour harsher punishment than Democrats. But the metaphor used made a difference twice as large \u2013 18-22%. Metaphors, Thibodeau and Boroditsky observe, \u201chave profound influences on how we conceptualise and act with respect to important societal issues\u201d.</p> <p>Social and political discussions are steeped in metaphors from \u201ctrickle-down economics\u201d to the \u201cred wall\u201d. They help frame the issues, and hence our responses, too. When politicians compare the national economy to a household budget, they are pushing us to think in particular ways about national debt or policies of austerity. Similarly, when politicians talk of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/30/david-cameron-migrant-swarm-language-condemned\" title=\"\">\u201cswarms\u201d of migrants </a>or describe countries as \u201cshields\u201d against them, the language aims to elicit particular public responses. The coronavirus is both a physical threat and a metaphor for everything from the failures of globalisation to the menace of foreigners.</p> <p>The role that metaphors play in science and politics is subtly different. Many scientists accept that metaphors can be limiting, but insist, too, that they are an essential tool for thinking. In political and social debates, metaphors are primarily ways of framing issues, and of shaping the ways in which people think about them.</p> <p>Metaphors can expand our vision and provide insights denied to more literal thinking. But, whether in science or in politics, we need to pay greater attention to the metaphors we wield.</p> <p>\u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist</p>",
  "<p>Evening is falling and the cold winter light is bleeding out of a steel-coloured sky. Soon the short Scandinavian afternoon will give way to night here on the edge of Lake Sonnanen in the south of Finland. Not a single gust of wind moves the pine branches; not a single ripple disturbs the water\u2019s surface. Nothing disturbs this infinite expanse of trees, ice and snow enveloped by absolute silence.</p> <p>It\u2019s here, in a simple hunter\u2019s lodge 170km northeast of Helsinki, that freediver Johanna Nordblad and her sister and personal photographer, Elina, spend most of their free time. With urban rhythms left far behind, their days are occupied by shovelling snow, gathering firewood and spending long hours after dinner chatting by candlelight.</p> <p>\u201cElina and I always come up here whenever we can. I love this natural setting, these lakes,\u201d explains Nordblad. \u201cPeople don\u2019t like to practise freediving in Finland because the water is black in the depths, but that\u2019s exactly why I like it so much. Down below there are no colours, no sounds. There\u2019s nothing\u2026 You are completely alone with yourself.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"987468e545d0ebf5c54249987b2270b8e80eeaff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/987468e545d0ebf5c54249987b2270b8e80eeaff/0_236_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I love this natural setting, these lakes\u2019: Nordblad getting ready to dive under the ice.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I love this natural setting, these lakes\u2019: Nordblad getting ready to dive under the ice.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elina Manninen/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nordblad, 44, from Finland, first freedived in 1999 after years as a scuba diver. The feeling of lightness proved liberating, and being able to swim without the weight of equipment won her over instantly. She began competing at world championship level \u2013 taking part in events where divers perform in different disciplines to see who can dive the deepest, or stay underwater the longest, with no breathing apparatus. There are 11 types of freediving \u2013 for example, diving for depth or swimming horizontally, with or without weights, with or without fins, in open water or swimming pools. Nordblad specialises in dynamic freediving with fins, which involves swimming as far as possible horizontally underwater on one breath.</p> <p>In 2004, in Cyprus, she set the women\u2019s world record by swimming a horizontal distance of 158m, and since then she has ranked among the best freedivers in the world.</p> <p>\u201cThe most difficult thing is watching the seconds go by. After two or three minutes your mind starts listing all the reasons why you should go back up to the surface instead of staying underwater. The more time goes by, the harder it gets. You need a lot of self-control,\u201d she says.</p> <p>But then, in 2010, a serious accident changed her life and set her on the path to make her mark in a new discipline, one in which she still holds the current world record: freediving under ice.</p> <p>\u201cI was riding a downhill bike, travelling a slippery, muddy path down a hill when suddenly I began to slip,\u201d she recounts. \u201cThe fall wasn\u2019t particularly dangerous, but I was unlucky and I hit a rock. My left leg was smashed into a thousand pieces, like a twisted branch.\u201d Rushed to hospital, Nordblad underwent delicate surgery. The swelling and compound fractures were so serious that the doctors weren\u2019t able to sew the leg back up and close the wounds until another 10 days had passed.</p> <p>A graphic designer by trade, she decided to sell her agency in Helsinki and say goodbye to the 13 people who were working for her to concentrate on rehabilitation, a painful and complex process that lasted for more than 18 months, consuming all her energies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a198b6c4177bec0a0b18358921b2b7c36f63ada3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a198b6c4177bec0a0b18358921b2b7c36f63ada3/0_374_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018My leg smashed into a thousand pieces\u2019: Nordblad on the bicycle accident that sparked her diving career.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018My leg smashed into a thousand pieces\u2019: Nordblad on the bicycle accident that sparked her diving career.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elina Manninen/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After another year had passed she was finally able to walk without a stick, but the nerves in her leg were so badly damaged that the pain was profound and persistent. \u201cThat\u2019s when my doctor recommended I try cold-water therapy,\u201d says Nordblad. \u201cThe first time I put my leg in 4C water I only managed to keep it in for a minute, but the relief was immediate. Finally, it didn\u2019t hurt any more.\u201d</p> <p>As the months passed, Nordblad became so accustomed to the cold that she found she could no longer do without it. She began immersing the other leg as well, then her entire body, ultimately even her head. \u201cI liked the way it felt. That\u2019s when I first got the idea of diving beneath the ice. What better place to try it than Finland?\u201d</p> <p>In what is known as apnea \u2013 conducted beneath the ice \u2013 the diver has to move horizontally, covering a preset distance between two holes cut into the ice. In 2015, Nordblad set the women\u2019s world record in this discipline \u2013 50m \u2013 wearing only a simple swimsuit and goggles. The water temperature was barely 2C. \u201cUp until the end I was afraid that my head, the part of the body that suffers the most during low-temperature dives, couldn\u2019t take it,\u201d she confesses. \u201cBut in reality things were easier than I\u2019d anticipated.\u201d</p> <p>While her sister is preparing dinner, Nordblad sits on the little wooden dock that runs out from the bank into the lake, busy breaking up the thin layer of ice that\u2019s formed on the water\u2019s surface over the past couple of days. After she\u2019s pushed a few sections underwater, she lights a series of candles that illuminate the wooden stairs leading down into the water. Soon she\u2019ll be able to take the first dive of the season. She\u2019s been waiting for this moment for weeks, and it stirs emotions she finds hard to conceal.</p> <p>\u201cI love diving, feeling the water run between your fingers\u2026 When you\u2019re down below there\u2019s no margin for error. You have only yourself to trust. You have to be relaxed and in control at the same time,\u201d she explains. \u201cFreediving requires physical effort, but mental discipline is even more important. You have to do the dive without panicking or losing your head.\u201d</p> <p>Swimming beneath ice has other pitfalls. Visibility is one, since the thick layer of ice and snow on the water\u2019s surface often reduces vision to a minimum. It\u2019s easy to become disoriented and not be able to even see the exit hole, so much so that safety ropes are extended between the holes. \u201cSometimes I can\u2019t even make out my own hands. That\u2019s how dark the water can be. In the event of a real emergency, my safety plan is to swim down deeper below the surface. That\u2019s the only way I can look up and see light coming in from the two holes and figure out where I can get out.\u201d</p> <p>Although it\u2019s hard to believe, Nordblad is afraid of the depths. Every time she goes freediving and swims down to the Finnish lakebed, her mind turns to sea monsters and unknown creatures that populate the abyss. \u201cThe deepest point I reach corresponds to the extreme limits of my ability to dominate my fears. Otherwise I could go much deeper,\u201d she says with a smile.</p> <p>Although she still holds the record for diving beneath the ice, for Nordblad freediving has long since evolved into something more than a desire to beat her opponents. \u201cIf you compete with that mentality, you\u2019re not enjoying the moment. I don\u2019t deny I thought that way when I was younger, but now I don\u2019t like it any more.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6ca4641272a3144b385c2b285c164507a814812\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6ca4641272a3144b385c2b285c164507a814812/0_213_5616_3509/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018So many windows of opportunity open up around you\u2019: Nordblad on winning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"625\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018So many windows of opportunity open up around you\u2019: Nordblad on winning.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elina Manninen/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen you win, the expectations of those around you increase automatically,\u201d she says. \u201cSo many different windows of opportunity open up around you that you have to be good at figuring out what you want from life and what you truly desire from this sport.\u201d</p> <p>In 2006, Nordblad earned one of just three government grants reserved for non-Olympic Finnish athletes. Not by chance, that was the year she found herself training the least. \u201cGoing to the pool just wasn\u2019t fun any more. I was losing motivation. I love apnea because I find it more stimulating than spending hours looking at a computer screen, but I realised I was turning it into a job just like any other,\u201d she explains. \u201cOne of the most beautiful periods of my life was the time just after my rehabilitation. I spent two years out in the open: I would take my kayak and go out and explore the islands around Helsinki. There are hundreds of them, and all you need is to paddle for five minutes before you\u2019re completely lost in nature.\u201d</p> <p>At the end of the month Nordblad will attempt to beat the men\u2019s ice freediving world record (currently standing at 76.2m and held by Stig Severinsen, a Danish four-time world freediving champion). She is aiming to swim horizontally beneath the ice for 81m. She will take the challenge in her stride, almost as if it were a game. Sometimes that\u2019s how remarkable achievements are accomplished.</p>",

Wines from \u20ac36</strong></p> <p>At <a href=\"https://www.bastible.com/\" title=\"\">Bastible</a> in Dublin, each dish comes with a commentary. Somehow, it manages to improve the experience, rather than make you squeeze the edge of your seat until your knuckles are white. Early on chef C\u00fa\u00e1n Greene delivers a small, rough-hewn ceramic dish to the table. There\u2019s a pillow of dried lemon verbena leaves overlaid with greaseproof paper upon which perch four curving, layered pieces of pearly kohlrabi, interleaved with sorrel leaves. The kohlrabi, we are told, has been marinated in quince vinegar. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of chilled salad in finger-food form,\u201d Greene says, cheerfully. He\u2019s not wrong: it\u2019s crisp and boldly refreshing. It\u2019s also clever without being irritatingly, look-at-me distracting. Most importantly it tastes nice. Important, that.</p> <p>I was directed to Bastible, the name of a traditional Irish cooking pot, by Lisa Cope, who writes for the <em>Irish Times</em> and edits <a href=\"https://www.allthefood.ie/\" title=\"\">All the Food</a>, a website covering the joys of eating and drinking in the Irish capital. This is the first time I\u2019ve reviewed in Dublin and she gave me the impression that now is the time to get there. Ireland, she said, is currently seeing the upside of the exodus of talent that occurred around the recession a decade or so ago. Chefs like Greene are flocking back, their pockets stuffed with experience, their heads full of new ideas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"35db6c1158ebe0789467ee47159238526b7e60ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35db6c1158ebe0789467ee47159238526b7e60ac/1391_403_3870_3559/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kohlrabi, sorrel, lemon verbena.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"920\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Salad as finger food\u2019: kohlrabi, sorrel, lemon verbena.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristan Hutchinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Greene\u2019s case, elsewhere was Noma in Copenhagen, where chef Ren\u00e9 Redzepi pursues a devoutly regionalist agenda: it\u2019s vinegar instead of lemon juice, butter rather than olive oil, because it\u2019s a northern European restaurant not a southern Mediterranean one. Some people, those who like ideology more than lunch, got the wrong end of the Norway spruce stick over all this. They saw Noma as somehow defining the correct agenda for all restaurants. In a globalised world, that\u2019s absurd. We can find such notions interesting in Dublin or Copenhagen, while still craving the flavours of Provence or Malaysia and being grateful they are available nearby.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4f415a48526084a779671241f9f6f682c46cb1cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f415a48526084a779671241f9f6f682c46cb1cd/278_1927_4147_3305/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grilled, compressed ox tongue.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"797\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pierced tongue: grilled, compressed ox tongue cured with juniper.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristan Hutchinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In truth, the agenda is utterly pointless unless, like Redzepi, you\u2019re also an exceptionally gifted chef. The same applies to Greene. The man is bursting with good taste and technique. Bastible was opened four years ago in Portobello to the south of Dublin\u2019s city centre by Barry Fitzgerald and Claire-Marie Thomas. Greene arrived last spring and is now throwing everything on to the table. Usually, the prospect of a tasting menu makes my left eye twitch, but here on a Sunday lunchtime it becomes a joyful dance. Those of us who arrive early \u2013 lunch trails on until darkness falls \u2013 get to watch those a few courses behind, jealously, knowing the joys they have to come.</p> <p>It starts, as ever, with an addictive, hard-crusted sourdough, with a crunch like crackling, and whorls of whipped, salty cultured butter that demand to be finished. That\u2019s followed by a cube of thinly sliced and then compressed ox tongue. It arrives pierced on the still-smoking twig on which it was grilled. It has been cured with juniper. It is seasoned with dried, powdered mushrooms and the seaside briskness of dried kelp. It has the soft meatiness of the very best pastrami.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23cbcd91343058701d8e4cfb0482dde66a333923\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23cbcd91343058701d8e4cfb0482dde66a333923/0_2658_4480_3091/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Swede cooked in ginger, with pumpkin seeds and kelp.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"690\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Swede sensation: cooked in ginger, with pumpkin seeds and kelp.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristan Hutchinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Next, there\u2019s a rough-chopped tartare of Dexter beef under the forest floor earthiness of an artichoke cream, thickly dusted with more dried, powdered ceps and layered with a few green leaves. It\u2019s a rugged dish in all ways. Against it, the kohlrabi acts as a palate cleanser and sets us up for the arrival of sweet and sticky Connemara prawns served raw, with thin slices of broccoli stem and leaves of marigold perched on top of each piece so that, arranged in a curve, they look like a Roman senator\u2019s garland. It sits in a pool of a deep green broth made with the juices from the kohlrabi, fig leaf oil and the punch of horseradish. These are the ingredients that are available now, shown as good a time as possible.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ebbdf0272183397df9d1528ac66c5574a80c6054\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebbdf0272183397df9d1528ac66c5574a80c6054/119_325_4361_6359/686.jpg\" alt=\"Cooking to thrill: chef C\u00fa\u00e1n Greene.\" width=\"686\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cooking to thrill: chef C\u00fa\u00e1n Greene.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristan Hutchinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As is the next dish. It\u2019s a \u201ccelebration of the humble swede\u201d as Greene puts it. (There are waiters working the simple square box of a dining room, but he does serve some of the dishes himself straight from the open kitchen to the tables.) The semi-circular discs of swede have been cooked slowly in ginger oil to a gentle piquancy. Alongside, is what he calls a pumpkin seed mole, a deep savoury sauce glowing with jewel-like dots of more oil. Tiny square pieces of slightly jellied kelp form a pattern across the swede along with hyper savoury pumpkin seeds roasted in yeast. Gosh. And, oh.</p> <p>I ask Greene about the ginger, which seems to break the regional frame. He agrees it does, but says he\u2019s not doctrinaire. For the most part, though, lunch comes from hereabouts and right now. We are presented with a slab of cured sea trout to share. It\u2019s a deep, appealing shade of dirty orange. It\u2019s been brushed repeatedly with a quince glaze and is warm so that the oils are just running. We are told to treat it like smoked salmon; to pull it away from the skin below. There\u2019s a farl of bread made with new potatoes, its undulating surface rendered dark and sticky courtesy of a cider-vinegar glaze. To mitigate the sweetness of the fish, we have a boisterously sour gooseberry compote, plus a bowl of yogurt dusted with powdered dried herbs. How you put these together is up to you. It has become the best kind of buffet.</p> <p>To finish we have a sweetened and set sheep\u2019s milk yogurt with a sauce of fermented plum. Better still, is an intense milk chocolate mousse hiding a scoop of yeast ice-cream, sprinkled with dried plum skins and blackcurrant, in a sweet, nutty syrup made from beer. Oh, and would you like a chewy caramel wrapped in blackcurrant leather and dusted with salt? Yes please.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd7e28a703dcdc3abfd095c7bc2f26c8f982b93c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd7e28a703dcdc3abfd095c7bc2f26c8f982b93c/0_2817_4480_3148/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Milk chocolate mousse\" width=\"1000\" height=\"703\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Intense and complex: milk chocolate mousse hiding a yeast ice-cream, with dried plum skins, blackcurrant, and a nutty beer syrup.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristan Hutchinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This has been my most detailed account of the food I was served in a long while, but Bastible warrants it. Even so I know I have left out details. It\u2019s that kind of place. Given this menu is just \u20ac45 (\u00a339), I would argue it warrants a weekend in Dublin. Just be aware that, courtesy of some the most savage duties in Europe, the wine list is a nightmare, with nothing below \u20ac36 (\u00a331). Don\u2019t worry.

I think his team will try to stay in that fairly narrow zone.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if they also spend a fair amount of time focused on Trump. Here\u2019s a way that he can use a sledgehammer on Trump but a scalpel on Sanders: by saying, \u2018Here\u2019s a guy we elected that had no experience, no people willing to work for him, no people he is willing to listen to. We can\u2019t have that anymore.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Galen and O\u2019Malley both deplored a tweet sent by Trump\u2019s campaign this week which called Biden a \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/TeamTrump/status/1238485971571576832\">rotting corpse of a candidate</a>\u201d, and said it was a taste of the fierce and dirty fight to come.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere is one question and only one question that viewers will be asking themselves during Sunday\u2019s debate,\u201d O\u2019Malley said, \u201cand it is this: which of these two candidates would do the best job of keeping me and my family safe in a big emergency, like, a pandemic.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat I do know is that of the three men left [including Trump], more and more people are wishing Biden were already in charge.\u201d</p> \n<p>In fact, the Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is still campaigning. For the debate in Washington on Sunday, however, she did not meet qualification criteria set by the Democratic National Committee.</p>",

Earlier on Saturday, vice-president Mike Pence announced that the country\u2019s European travel ban would be extended to the UK and Ireland from midnight on Monday (eastern standard time).</li> \n   <li><strong>NHS and private hospitals join forces to fight coronavirus. </strong>The NHS is to form <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/coronavirus-nhs-private-hospitals-join-forces-academics-warn-over-strategy\">an unprecedented partnership</a> with the private health sector this week in an emergency plan to combat the Covid-19 crisis, amid fears the UK\u2019s publicly-funded hospitals will be unable to cope with the number of coronavirus patients. </li> \n   <li><strong>A group of more than 240 UK scientists have denounced the government\u2019s plan to achieve \u201cherd immunity\u201d by delaying measures to prevent the virus spreading. </strong>The group <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/14/scientists-urge-government-to-enforce-social-distancing-now\">said that enforcing social distancing now</a> could save \u201cthousands of lives\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Spanish government has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/spain-government-set-to-order-nationwide-coronavirus-lockdown\">formally declared</a> a state of emergency over the coronavirus, placing the country in lockdown and ordering people to stay at home for the next two weeks unless they have to buy food or medicine or go to work or hospital.</strong> The measures are set to come into effect on Monday morning and follows in the example set by France hours earlier, which announced the closure all public places \u201cnon-essential\u201d from midnight on Saturday. </li> \n   <li><strong>Spanish PM\u2019s wife tests positive for coronavirus. </strong>The Spanish government announced that the prime minister\u2019s wife, Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez, has tested positive for the coronavirus. Both Gomez and her husband, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, are doing well and remain at their official residence in Madrid, the Moncloa palace, the government said in a statement.</li> \n   <li><strong>Israel proposes uses anti-terrorism tracking tech. </strong>Israel has \u2013 like France and Spain \u2013 announced a partial closure of the country, shutting down hotels, cafes, restaurants, cinemas, theatres and malls. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu added that he hopes to deploy anti-terrorism tracking technology to locate people who have been in contact with those carrying the virus. He said he had requested Justice Ministry approval because such measures could infringe patients\u2019 privacy.\u201cThe enemy is invisible, but we must locate it,\u201d Netanyahu said.</li> \n   <li><strong>Colombia closes border with Venezuela and Ecuador bans foreigners. </strong>Colombia overnight closed its border with Venezuela in order to stem the spread of Covid-19 in the South American nation. The move to shut the border came overnight, after Venezuela confirmed its first two cases of Covid-19 on Friday morning. Colombia currently has 22 confirmed cases of Covid-19, but its government appears to view Venezuela - with fewer cases - as a possible centre of an outbreak in Latin America. Meanwhile, Ecuador announced it would ban foreigners from entering the country by land, sea or air. Citizens and residents will be able to enter until Monday, after which they will also face restrictions. Gatherings larger than 30 people have also been banned.</li> \n   <li><strong>Libya\u2019s Tripoli-based Government of National Accord has declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus and will close all air and sea ports from Monday, prime minister Fayez al-Serraj said on Saturday.</strong> Libya, split for years between rival governments that have been fighting a war for nearly a year, lacks adequate isolation and other facilities to combat the virus, the head of its disease control centre told Reuters on Thursday.</li> \n   <li><strong>Rwanda, Seychelles and Central African Republic confirmed their first coronavirus cases on Saturday \u2013 bringing the total number of African countries that have reported positive tests for the virus to 23. </strong>Sudan has ordered the closure of schools and universities for one month from Saturday to stop the spread of coronavirus, a statement from the prime minister\u2019s office said. While Morocco has banned flight to and from as many as 25 countries.</li> \n   <li><strong>Global number of confirmed cases stands at 156,098, with 5,819 deaths. </strong>As of today 72,621 people have recovered, according to <a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Johns Hopkins University</a>.

on the situation in Colombia and Venezula from my Bogota-based colleague <strong>Joe Parkin Daniels</strong> :</p> \n  <p>Colombia overnight closed its border with Venezuela in order to stem the spread of Covid-19 in the South American nation, a move that is likely to have lasting ramifications given the scale of Venezuela\u2019s migration crisis.</p> \n  <p>About 4.5 million people have fled Venezuela which, despite boasting the planet\u2019s largest proven oil reserves, remains mired in years-long economic and social turmoil. Hyperinflation is rampant, with shortages in basic foodstuffs and medical supplies already a daily reality. Around 1.4 million of those that have left have arrived to Colombia, which shares a 1,378-mile border with Venezuela.</p> \n  <p>Authorities estimate as many as 40,000 people cross the border every day, the majority of which buy supplies - medicines and food staples - and return home.</p> \n  <p>The move to shut the border came overnight, after Venezuela confirmed its first two cases of Covid-19 on Friday morning.</p> \n  <p>The two countries broke diplomatic relations when Colombia ceased to recognise its embattled leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, as the country\u2019s legitimate president in early 2019, as part of an ongoing US-led coalition to oust him from office. Analysts say that will hamper coordination to contain a virus that does not respect borders.</p> \n  <p>Others worry that the closure will force desperate Venezuelans to cross informally, putting them at risk of armed groups operating along the border. </p> \n  <p>\u201cColombia\u2019s overnight decision to \u2018close\u2019 its porous border with Venezuela won\u2019t stop the flow of people,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GRamsey_LatAm/status/1238832345916071936\">tweeted</a> Geoff Ramsey, a Venezuela expert at the Washington Office on Latin America. \u201cBut it will force them to rely more on informal crossings where they\u2019ll be more vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Colombia currently has 22 confirmed cases of Covid-19, but its government appears to view Venezuela - with fewer cases - as a possible centre of an outbreak in Latin America. Iv\u00e1n Duque M\u00e1rquez, Colombia\u2019s president, described the closure in a statement as \u201ca measure of protection ahead of the situation unfolding in [Venezuela].\u201d</p> \n  <p>M\u00e1rquez also announced overnight a ban on travellers who have been in Europe or Asia in the last 14 days, with the exceptions of Colombian citizens and residents.</p> \n  <p>All measures are expected to last until 30 May.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-14T17:41:21.305Z\">at 5.41pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6d11628f085c6327bbff36\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-14T17:21:57.821Z\">5.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In the UK, a newborn baby tested positive for coronavirus at a north London hospital <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/newborn-baby-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-in-london\">earlier today</a>. </p> \n  <p>The child\u2019s mother, who was taken to a north <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london\">London</a> hospital days before the birth with suspected pneumonia, has also caught the virus.</p> \n  <p>Richard Tedder, visiting professor in medical virology, Imperial College London, said this raises \u201cconcerns about the potential ways in which this transmission may have occurred\u201d.</p> \n  <p>He told PA Media:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is important to say at this point in time that the detection of Covid-19 nucleic acid on the sample from the child does not necessarily mean that the child was infected. </p> \n   <p>It could well have come from the mother at the time of delivery, further follow-up of the infant will clarify whether or not the infant is infected.</p> \n   <p>Previous data from colleagues in China, published in the journal The Lancet, albeit on a small number of mother and infant pairs, did not show infection in any of the infants at the time of birth. Neither did sampling of breast milk immediately after birth contain detectable virus. Thus, the UK observation of a possible neonatal transmission is unexpected and needs further confirmation.</p> \n   <p>The question of risk to a newly born child being nursed by a mother who is known to be infected is a matter that will need careful consideration. </p> \n   <p>The absence of detectable virus in breast milk would appear to reduce the risk of breastfeeding however the close, intimate and entirely understandable contact between a mother and her baby will raise questions about how best to care for them. Compounding this too is the lack of knowledge of the clinical outcome of neonatal infection, should this actually occur.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6d10118f088d75755936d0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-14T17:14:19.548Z\">5.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Italy\u2019s coronavirus death toll rose to 1,441 from 1,266 on Friday, according to official data.

The son developed symptoms a fortnight after returning to India. Officials are trying to trace the 1,500 people he may have been in contact with at the large plant where he worked. </p> \n  <p>Her family complained that the cemetery they took her to refused to cremate her. Crematoriums in India tended to be crowded and the staff felt at risk. It was only when doctors arrived to prescribe the right protocol that her last rites were performed. The number of coronavirus cases in India stands at 84.</p> \n  <p>With no hand sanitisers available, the New Delhi government has designated them \u2018essential commodities\u2019 so that anyone hoarding them or selling them at inflated prices can be punished by law.</p> \n  <p> As stories trickle in of some people concealing their travel history to affected areas or refusing to be tested and, if necessary, isolated, the Delhi government has also invoked the Epidemic Act. This allows district magistrates to take coercive action to isolate high-risk people. </p> \n  <p>The wife of a Google employee in Bengaluru, for example, fled her home and vanished last week. Officials found that she had flown to Delhi \u2013 at the other end of the country - and travelled by train to Agra to her parents\u2019 home.</p> \n  <p>Across many states, social life is being curbed with weddings, engagement ceremonies and birthday parties banned in the south Indian state of Karnataka. The message to Indians is to stay at home and avoid large gatherings. Several states have closed swimming pools, gyms, cinemas, night clubs, and theatres. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6ccf648f088d7575593533\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-14T12:40:21.340Z\">12.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A petition calling for the UK to go into lockdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus has reached more than 110,000 signatures, meaning it will be considered for parliamentary debate. </p> \n  <p>It encourages the UK to follow the containment procedures of countries that have been widely affected by the outbreak, by restricting unnecessary travel and discouraging public gatherings. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIt is time the government should prioritise the health of the public and should consider how vital it is to implement effective containment now,\u201d the petition says. \u201cIt is better to spend money to contain the virus and treating the relatively low numbers who are ill now rather than wait for more casualties.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The government responds to all petitions with more than 10,000 signatures, and considers any petition with more than 100,000 signatures for parliamentary debate.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-14T12:41:07.909Z\">at 12.41pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6ccdf18f085c6327bbfd82\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-14T12:29:53.448Z\">12.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This video explores how Islam has been impacted by coronavirus.

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Donald Trump given coronavirus all clear</h2> <p>Donald Trump\u2019s physician, Sean Conley, has confirmed the US president does not have Covid-19. A memo from Conley said that the president had agreed to be tested for the virus following an \u201cin-depth discussion\u201d on Friday night. A week earlier he had dinner with a Brazilian official who later tested positive. Earlier on Saturday, vice-president Mike Pence announced that the country\u2019s European travel ban would be extended to the UK and Ireland from midnight on Monday (eastern standard time).</p> <h2>NHS and private hospitals join forces to fight coronavirus</h2> <p>The NHS is to form an unprecedented partnership with the private health sector this week in an emergency plan to combat the Covid-19 crisis, amid fears the UK\u2019s publicly funded hospitals will be unable to cope with the number of patients. Meanwhile, a group of more than 200 UK scientists have denounced the government\u2019s plan to achieve \u201cherd immunity\u201d by delaying measures to prevent the virus spreading. The group <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/14/scientists-urge-government-to-enforce-social-distancing-now\">said that enforcing social distancing now</a> could save \u201cthousands of lives\u201d.</p> <h2>Lockdown announced in Spain</h2> <p>The Spanish government has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/spain-government-set-to-order-nationwide-coronavirus-lockdown\">formally declared</a> a state of emergency over the coronavirus, placing the country in lockdown and ordering people to stay at home for the next two weeks unless they have to buy food or medicine or go to work or hospital. The measures are set to come into effect on Monday morning and follow the example set by France hours earlier, which announced the closure of all \u201cnon-essential\u201d public places from midnight on Saturday. Restaurants, cafes, cinemas and discos will be closed under the measures. Pharmacies and places selling other basic necessities will be exempted.</p> <h2>Spanish PM\u2019s wife tests positive for coronavirus</h2> <p>The Spanish government announced that the prime minister\u2019s wife, Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez, has tested positive for the coronavirus. Both Gomez and her husband, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, are doing well and remain at their official residence in Madrid, the Moncloa palace, the government said in a statement.</p> <h2>Israel proposes use of anti-terrorism tracking tech</h2> <p>Israel has \u2013 like France and Spain \u2013 announced a partial closure of the country, shutting hotels, cafes, restaurants, cinemas, theatres and malls. Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu added that he hopes to deploy anti-terrorism tracking technology to locate people who have been in contact with those carrying the virus. He said he had requested Justice Ministry approval because such measures could infringe patients\u2019 privacy. \u201cThe enemy is invisible, but we must locate it,\u201d Netanyahu said.</p> <h2>Colombia closes border with Venezuela and Ecuador bans foreigners</h2> <p>Colombia closed its border with Venezuela in order to stem the spread of Covid-19 in the South American nation. The move to shut the border came overnight, after Venezuela \u200bconfirmed its first two cases of Covid-19 on Friday morning. Colombia currently has 22 confirmed cases of Covid-19, but its government appears to view Venezuela \u2013 with fewer cases \u2013 as a possible centre\u200b of an outbreak in Latin America. Meanwhile, Ecuador announced it would ban foreigners from entering the country by land, sea or air. Citizens and residents will be able to enter until Monday, after which they will also face restrictions. Gatherings larger than 30 people have also been banned.</p> <h2>State of emergency announced in Libya</h2> <p>Libya\u2019s Tripoli-based Government of National Accord has declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus and will close all air and sea ports from Monday, prime minister Fayez al-Serraj said on Saturday. Libya, split for years between rival governments that have been fighting a war for nearly a year, lacks adequate isolation and other facilities to combat the virus, the head of its disease control centre told Reuters on Thursday.</p> <h2>Number of African countries to report Covid-19 cases rises</h2> <p>Rwanda, Seychelles and Central African Republic confirmed their first coronavirus cases on Saturday \u2013 bringing the total number of African countries that have reported positive tests for the virus to 23. Sudan has ordered the closure of schools and universities for one month from Saturday to stop the spread of coronavirus, a statement from the prime minister\u2019s office said. Morocco has banned flights to and from as many as 25 countries.</p> <h2><strong>Global number of confirmed cases stands at 156,098, with 5,819 deaths</strong></h2> <p>As of today 72,621 people have recovered, according to <a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Johns Hopkins University</a>. The institution runs a live tracker of coronavirus cases, based on official figures, meaning that the true figures may be somewhat higher.</p>"
