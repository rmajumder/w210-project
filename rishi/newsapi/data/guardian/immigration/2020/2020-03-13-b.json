  "<p>America\u2019s failure to provide quick and easily accessible testing to people suspected to have the coronavirus has been a central thrust of criticism about the US response to the threat from the global pandemic.</p> \n<p>That has left many wondering how the US could have got its coronavirus response so wrong, though it appears that steps are now being taken to try and catch up with the outbreak\u2019s spread.</p> \n<p><strong>The Trump administration is scrambling to provide more testing for Covid-19. What is happening?</strong></p> \n<p>New measures are being introduced that should speed up access to test kits. Roche, the manufacturer of state-of-the-art testing machines that are 10 times faster at getting results than other models, has just been given <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-13/roche-gets-clearance-for-coronavirus-test-that-s-10-times-faster?utm_campaign=news&amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;utm_source=applenews\">approval</a> by the US Food and Drug Administration to produce a new coronavirus test which should see 500,000 or so additional kits available from next week. New York state, which is an epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, has also been given permission to run its own testing operation using both public and private laboratories.</p> \n<p>At a White House <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/mar/13/donald-trump-coronavirus-joe-biden-bernie-sanders-live-updates-news\">press conference</a> on Friday, Donald Trump said the federal government was working in partnership with private laboratories such as Quest Diagnostics to sharply increase capacity. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ba13ce6a-1fc7-45a1-81b1-3dc9c1afeb5f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mOT8pnLvEOc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>All of this is good news, as it is should bring much more testing capacity on stream.</p> \n<p><strong>So now there will be more testing available the crisis is over, right?</strong></p> \n<p>Wrong.</p> \n<p>The US is woefully behind the curve in tackling the novel coronavirus, especially in terms of testing. It is now thought the disease may have first emerged in China as early as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/first-covid-19-case-happened-in-november-china-government-records-show-report\">November</a> though Chinese authorities only revealed the crisis in January. Even so, Trump was only putting crucial elements of the US testing strategy in place on Friday, almost two months after the scale of the danger was fully known. With a virus that is as contagious and lethal for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/covid-19-what-we-know-and-do-not-know-about-the-coronavirus\">vulnerable populations</a> as Covid-19, that is unthinkably slow.</p> \n<p><strong>What explains this abysmal failure?</strong></p> \n<p>\u201cFailure\u201d is right. That\u2019s precisely the word that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-us-testing-failures-trump-administration\">Dr Anthony Fauci</a>, one of the top US officials dealing with the crisis, used to describe the testing fiasco on Thursday.</p> \n<p>A number of problems contributed to the disaster. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is marshaling federal testing, botched its rollout of test kits in February, sending out faulty materials. A bottleneck then ensued, with states all having to send their samples to the CDC\u2019s headquarters in Atlanta for analysis which slowed results down.</p> \n<p>The federal government was also too controlling of the process, preventing states and private laboratories running their own decentralized efforts. The criteria for testing was set far too tightly. Doctors were initially told they could only test people who had traveled to China or had close contact with infected individuals. Only now can doctors freely offer testing, and even so there are simply not enough kits to go round.</p> \n<p><strong>So how bad is the shortfall?</strong></p> \n<p>Extremely bad. A few statistics put it in perspective. South Korea, which is increasingly being seen as a model of good practice, has been testing up to 15,000 people a day \u2013 and has reached more than 230,000 people.</p> \n<p>In the US, the total number of people who have been tested is still only about 11,000. That\u2019s a per capita rate that is about 130 times lower than in South Korea.</p> \n<p>This matters. South Korea\u2019s blanket testing has helped the country turn the corner of the epidemic. The number of new cases reported in South Korea every day is now falling, suggesting good policy and strong leadership can beat the virus. The US had neither.</p> \n<p><strong>Basic question: why is testing important?</strong></p> \n<p>The even more basic answer is that Covid-19 is invisible and can easily go undetected. It also spreads very quickly, and can be passed along by people who themselves have no symptoms. Trying to combat the disease without testing is like running through a forest blindfolded \u2013 it\u2019s not going to end well.</p> \n<p>The only way to get to grips with the disease, experts say, other than locking down entire cities like China and Italy have done, is mass testing. This allows doctors and government to operate on two levels: they can identify carriers of the virus who can then be quarantined until they are no longer infectious, and they can also carry out random sample testing in communities to spot localized outbreaks that can then be targeted as \u201ccontainment zones\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/nyregion/coronavirus-new-rochelle-containment.html\">New Rochelle</a> outside New York city is an example, where the National Guard was sent this week to deliver food to quarantined families.</p> \n<p><strong>How do the tests work?</strong></p> \n<p>Swabs are taken from the mouth or throat and then sent to laboratories. The aim is to gain a match with Covid-19\u2019s genetic sequence. The new Roche test takes only four hours to get results, but earlier versions can take up to 48 hours which slows things down.</p> \n<p><strong>So who is to blame for the lethally late push for testing?</strong></p> \n<p>With a health crisis of this dimension, the buck stops at the top, and that\u2019s Trump. From the outside, medical experts say, he has taken the wrong approach, thinking of Covid-19 as an outside threat to be dealt with by closing borders rather than an inevitable and already existing fact of life inside the US that must be dealt with through testing and isolation. This week, in his Oval Office address to the nation, Trump called it the \u201cforeign virus\u201d which is a dangerously misleading concept. Remarkably, he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1238478167695863817\">continued to talk</a> on Friday about combating coronavirus through \u201ca very strong border policy\u201d, when the disease has almost certainly been prevalent inside the US undetected for weeks.</p> \n<p>The bottom line is that Covid-19 is happening on Trump\u2019s watch. He may find his usual techniques for deflecting criticism \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/12/fact-checking-trumps-address-nation-cornavirus/\">lying</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/03/trump-coronavirus-threat/607825/\">adopting conspiracy theories</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/us/politics/trump-coronavirus.html\">blaming others</a> \u2013 may not spare him the consequences this time.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>Update: A previous version of this story referenced a Google site which Trump announced on Friday would advise individuals on how to gauge their symptoms and, if needed, steer them towards new drive-in testing facilities. Despite Trump\u2019s announcement of such a service, that service does not appear, with a subsequent statement by the Google-adjacent company in question, to be real. The company Verily, which shares a corporate umbrella with Google, released a statement after Trump\u2019s press conference announcing that it was developing a Covid-19 triage test tool, but the tool \u201c</em><em>is in the early stages of development\u201d,</em><em> and the company is \u201cplanning to roll testing out in the Bay Area\u201d,</em><em> not nationally.</em></p></li> \n</ul>",

The starting point is \u20ac8bn of unspent money from the EU budget for infrastructure spending - \u201csleeping money\u201d as von der Leyen put it - that is intended to trigger a further \u20ac29bn of public and private funds. <br><br>But EU member states and the European parliament - currently meeting in restricted sessions because of the virus - will have to approve the idea. <br><br>The commission also provided more details on measures announced earlier this week, such as loosening rules on state aid, and making use of flexibility in EU budget rules. <br><br>Measures include: <br></p> <ul> <li><strong>Relaxing airport slot rules. </strong>Airlines will not lose their prized landing and take-off slots, if they fail to use them as a result of travel bans and falling demand. A waiver on the usual \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d rule that requires carriers to use 80% of their slots, will run until 30 June 2020 and can be extended if necessary.<br><br></li> <li><strong>Loosening rules on state aid, </strong>so governments can help companies by suspending tax payments or compensate those suffering losses. The commission said it had already signed off a Danish scheme in less than 24 hours, promising to do the same for other countries.<br><br></li> <li><strong>Releasing \u20ac1bn from the EU budget,</strong> which is expected to cover \u20ac8bn in loan guarantees, with the aim of providing liquidity to 100,000 small and medium-sized companies.<br><br></li> <li><strong>Governments will be able to use flexibilities in the EU stability and growth pact rules that restrict the deficit.</strong> In normal years a state\u2019s deficit cannot exceed 3% of gross domestic product. This rule will be relaxed under an \u201cunusual events\u201d clause, so governments can, for example, pay self-employed people or help companies that have put workers on half time, without facing fines from Brussels </li> </ul> <p>She also said France and Germany were \u201cwilling to adapt\u201d export bans on medical goods, such as masks and ventilators. Such restrictions flout EU rules on the free movement of goods and have angered countries that do not produce such products. <br></p> <p>Von der Leyen said the commission would do more if needed, delivering the message in the EU\u2019s three working languages of English, French and German. <br></p> <p>\u201cThis is an important economic package but we have to acknowledge the situation is evolving fast.

Some 40% of the fledgling nation\u2019s population (predominantly men aged between 25 and 40 \u2013 a similar demographic to that which contributed most to this commonwealth\u2019s world war one fatality lists) would contract the flu that ultimately killed 13,000 Australians and 50 million people worldwide. And by mid-late 1919 \u2013 by which time the Australian papers were filled with articles about the hundreds of people who were dying weekly \u2013 the federation, still working on the myth that nationhood stemmed from a foreign war, was buckling in the face of contagion.</p> <p>As the historian <a href=\"https://honesthistory.net.au/wp/mcqueen-humphrey-spanish-flu-pandemic-australia-1912-19/\">Humphrey McQueen writes in The Spanish Influenza Epidemic in Australia, 1918-19</a>: \u201cIn 1915 an external menace had driven Australians together; by 1919, an internal danger revealed yet again how easy it was for Australian to stand apart. If national unity involved loyalty to the Commonwealth as an administrative machine, the Pandemic showed how little of it there was.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/four-lessons-the-spanish-flu-can-teach-us-about-coronavirus\">Four lessons the Spanish flu can teach us about coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Indeed, as the Spanish flu hit Australian shores in January \u2013 first via the servicemen returning home \u2013 it did not take long for state-versus-state loyalties to eclipse national federal interests.</p> <p>As McQueen recounts, in late 1918, before Australian health authorities had experienced a single known case, the federal government had acquired the power to close interstate borders upon notification by state health officers of Spanish flu cases. The states effectively ceded control of borders and interstate traffic to the commonwealth.</p> <p>The first diagnosed case in New South Wales challenged the integrity of that agreement. He was a returned soldier who had come to Sydney from Melbourne. Victoria, despite medical evidence to the contrary, had not notified the commonwealth of the Spanish flu in its midst. It was only after NSW notified the commonwealth (its headquarters and federal parliament were based at the time in Melbourne) that Victoria itself made the formal notification. NSW, blaming Victoria for the transmission, responded unilaterally, shutting its border with Victoria and walking away from the agreement.</p> <p>Once transmitted to Australia the flu rapidly escaped a quarantine system whose efficacy relied on the honesty of ship medical officers to volunteer past or present cases on board, and the willingness of returned soldiers to self-report and voluntarily isolate themselves rather than seek \u201ccures\u201d.</p> <p>Quackery was rampant. The broader medical fraternity was divided on origins of the flu, methods and bases of diagnosis, and possible treatment.</p> <p>Then \u2013 as now with coronavirus \u2013 \u201cforeigners\u201d, even those who\u2019d been in Australia for generations, were treated with utmost suspicion.</p> <p>Indeed, in Australia and throughout allied Europe and the US, the supposed genesis of the Spanish flu had its foundations firmly in fear and blame of the other, not least the old enemy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/09/spanish-flu-pandemic-centenary-first-world-war\">Spanish flu: the killer that still stalks us, 100 years on</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis modern plague \u2026 has commonly been called Spanish influenza,\u201d <a href=\"https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/140221010\">the Australasian of 29 March 1919 reported</a>. \u201cYet it did not originate in Spain, nor was it exactly the grippe or influenza of other days. It appears that the Germans, in anticipation that the malady might be justly named German plague \u2026 broadcast a misleading name which they had craftily devised before the infection spread from Germany to other countries.\u201d</p> <p>There was no evidence the pandemic began in Germany. Epidemiologists have since determined it was likely that servicemen from the US \u2013 who entered the war late \u2013 brought a milder flu strain to Europe. It then transmogrified into the Spanish flu (so named because the king of Spain was among the first to die of it).</p> <p>In Australia schools were closed, sporting events \u2013 if they proceeded \u2013 were unattended, and worshippers stayed away from church. As borders closed and the west coast was isolated from the east, and as coastal shipping all but ceased, the war-hit economy slowed. The poor and disadvantaged \u2013 especially Aboriginal communities who had always been hit disproportionately by European-introduced illness \u2013 were impacted the hardest.

  "<p>Cheltenham would not be Cheltenham without despair as well as triumph, and no image this week summed up the ability of one to turn abruptly to the other as the sight of Jamie Moore, head in hands, on the landing side of the final hurdle here on Friday at the end of the Triumph Hurdle.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/13/al-boum-photo-wins-cheltenham-gold-cup-horse-racing-festival\">Al Boum Photo wins back-to-back Cheltenham Gold Cups</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Moore approached the obstacle on Goshen, trained by his father Gary, with a lead of at least a dozen lengths and the Grade One race seemingly his. Goshen was trading at 1-25 in-running on Betfair as Moore asked him to pick up at the last, but Goshen did not get the message, hit the hurdle and then stumbled across, giving his rider no chance of staying in the saddle.</p> <p>His departure brought a howl of anguish from the stands, and left Burning Victory, from Willie Mullins\u2019s stable, to come home in front of Aspire Tower for a very fortunate win. Mullins, whose son Patrick rides for him regularly as well as being his assistant, has never seemed as uncomfortable in the winner\u2019s enclosure as he did here.</p> <p>\u201cI just feel sorry for Gary and Jamie,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got the rub of the green there, lucky for us and unlucky for Gary and Jamie and connections. I know Gary and Jamie very well, a father-and-son team, [this was] their one shot at a winner at the Festival and it was all done, the work was done and the horse just didn\u2019t respond to the question that Jamie asked at the last. We\u2019ve been here with Ruby [Walsh, after last-flight falls] so I know what it feels like.\u201d</p> <p>Moore was too upset to speak as he returned to the weighing room, but Steve Packham, Goshen\u2019s owner, who was having his first runner at the Festival, was sanguine about the turn of events.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of those things, it\u2019s jump racing, unfortunately,\u201d Packham said. \u201cHe\u2019s not the first horse to fall or unseat at the final jump at Cheltenham and he won\u2019t be the last. Jamie is obviously distraught.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a massive thing for me just to have a runner at Cheltenham, because I\u2019ve been coming here for 30 years. I\u2019ve lived and dreamed every scenario over the past month, from falling at the first to falling at the last and winning, so it hasn\u2019t completely surprised me.\u201d</p> <p>The only consolation for Goshen\u2019s connections is that they clearly have a hugely talented hurdler who acts around Cheltenham, and Goshen is quoted at around 10-1 to return to the Festival and win the Champion Hurdle in 12 months.</p> <p>There was a dramatic finish too in the Albert Bartlett Novice Hurdle, as Mullins\u2019s Monkfish got the better of a four-way tussle up the hill to edge out Latest Exhibition by a neck and a nose, with Thyme Hill, the favourite, another length and a quarter away in fourth having been short of room in the closing stages.</p> <p>\u201cMonkfish looks a real chaser,\u201d Mullins said. \u201cI thought Paul [Townend] gave him a fantastic ride to extract him out behind the two horses. I thought we were settled for third when they passed him after jumping the last but Paul really drove him up the hill.</p> <p>\u201cMonkfish is maturing all the time and Paul said that he felt there is still more to come, he said you could feel the power coming when he got after him. He is a huge, big horse, but if he has to come back and win a Stayers\u2019 Hurdle, we won\u2019t complain either.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2020/mar/13/cheltenham-festival-2020-in-pictures\">Triumphs, tumbles and hand sanitiser: Cheltenham Festival 2020 \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mullins\u2019s four-timer in the first four races on the card, which also included the victory of Saint Roi in the County Hurdle, was enough to secure him the prize for the meeting\u2019s top trainer, while he finishes the meeting with a lifetime total of 72 winners. His run came to an end in the Foxhunters\u2019 Chase, however, where Billaway, the 11-4 favourite with Paddy Mullins holding the reins, could finish only second behind the shock 66-1 winner, It Came To Pass.</p> <p>It Came To Pass represents another partnership of the generations, as he is trained in County Cork by Eugene O\u2019Sullivan and was ridden to victory by his daughter, Maxine. It was also the trainer\u2019s second win in the race, 29 years after landing it with Lovely Citizen, with his brother William in the saddle.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to win this race for 29 years,\u201d O\u2019Sullivan said. \u201cI won it when I was very young and I\u2019m a lot older now.

Front View has been well supported and looks like starting favourite for last year\u2019s winning team of Joseph O\u2019Brien/JP McManus/Jonjo O\u2019Neill Jr. He ran on nicely to be second behind Five O\u2019Clock and can be expected to step forward on that first outing for three months.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6bbb3e8f085e564ad83b6b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-13T16:56:51.543Z\">4.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Grand Annual (4.50) result</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>1 Chosen Mate (D N Russell) 7-2 Fav</strong><br>2 Eclair De Beaufeu (S F O\u2019Keeffe) 13-2<br>3 Us And Them (J J Slevin) 10-1<br>4 Greaneteen (H Cobden) 5-1<br>18 ran<br>Non Runners: 12,18<br>CSF: 25.46<br>Tricast: 215.45</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6bbabf8f088d7575592f36\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-13T16:55:19.160Z\">4.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <h2>Grand Annual (4.50) 2m</h2> <p>Chosen Mate leads over the last under Davy Russell and wins from Eclair De Beaufeu.

He might have preferred drier ground.</p> <p>Paul Nicholls has won this twice in four years and tries again with Greaneteen, a winner of his last three, though the form does not look irresistibly strong.

Saint Roi has crashed from 14-1 to 6-1 in the last 24 hours, having been put up by an influential tipster. That\u2019s terrible news for him because favourites have a poor record and it does not improve matters (trends-wise) that he is a handicap debutant who races prominently. But he won in a good time at Tramore and has more to offer.</p> <p>Ciel De Neige, also representing the JP/Willie Mullins team, was a good second in the Betfair Hurdle last time and is only up 4lb. From the Dan Skelton yard that has won three Countys in the past four years comes Mohaayed, the 2018 winner, back down to a beatable mark for the first time in ages. He goes well fresh and has had a wind op since he was last seen in December.</p> <p>Aramon, another for Mullins, has been in Grade Ones for his last eight starts. He\u2019ll travel well and the question is whether he can finish strongly enough. Adjali is, according to the betting, the first string of Nicky Henderson, who hasn\u2019t won this since 1997. This one became disappointing as a juvenile and has work to do on his sixth at Ascot when last seen in November. Stolen Silver, for Team Twiston-Davies, has some good form with some leading novices and was a staying-on eighth in the Betfair Hurdle.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6b8f798f085c6327bbf514\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-13T13:52:40.823Z\">1.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d532eafa4e883544fb0893179f20b0bc16e77169\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d532eafa4e883544fb0893179f20b0bc16e77169/0_0_3500_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jamie Moore and Goshen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"686\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jamie Moore and Goshen approach the last 11 lengths clear of the field.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Cooper/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f92043e44a897825858921cfc5006cf58bc33a56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f92043e44a897825858921cfc5006cf58bc33a56/0_0_3500_2384/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jamie Moore and Goshen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"681\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Goshen slips on landing and Moore struggles to stay on board.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Cooper/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"762080ca6190d43e269c6e9a5ab256f95368b46e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/762080ca6190d43e269c6e9a5ab256f95368b46e/15_0_2426_1455/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jamie Moore\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gravity wins and Moore begs the ground to open up and swallow him.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Cooper/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6b8e698f085e564ad838e2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-13T13:47:57.746Z\">1.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jamie Moore and Goshen update: </strong>One of the weigh room\u2019s elder statesmen, Moore took a bit of a kicking after being unshipped at the last, but he is physically fine.

An ex-Flat racer, like last year\u2019s Triumph winner, Pentland Hills, he won here in November and added a Grade One at Chepstow over Christmas.</p> <p>Goshen, the favourite, has also been making all and winning by wide margins, though he has also been jumping to his right, so let\u2019s hope we don\u2019t have another Asterion Forlonge on our hands. Both meet a drier surface this time than they have been racing on, which, together with competition for the lead, may undermine their chances.</p> <p>Ireland\u2019s Aspire Tower has also been racing at the front and may have won but for a late fall last time. Solo looks like the type to settle a little behind the pace before finishing strongly and will surely be dangerous. A Wave Of The Sea, who ran on to win when Aspire Tower fell, is another who should be doing his best work at the finish. Those who fancy Burning Victory or Hook Up should know that Willie Mullins is 0/27 in this since Scolardy won in 2002.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6b81d28f085c6327bbf448\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-13T12:52:23.677Z\">12.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa4181659bb88d94f40a7bacd6e2c2ba43281ed1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa4181659bb88d94f40a7bacd6e2c2ba43281ed1/0_0_3500_2303/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cheltenham Festival  2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"658\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Race-going lads and their banter trousers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-13T12:53:04.498Z\">at 12.53pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e6b721a8f085e564ad83767\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-13T11:44:28.516Z\">11.44am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\"> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/mar/13/talking-horses-al-boum-photo-to-claim-repeat-victory-in-gold-cup-horse-racing-tips\">Talking Horses: Al Boum Photo to claim repeat victory in Gold Cup</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6b70468f085c6327bbf349\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/chriscook\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-13T11:39:55.857Z\">11.39am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Martin Pipe Hurdle (5.30) preview</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This handicap is an acknowledged target for Gordon Elliott, who used to work for Pipe, and he won it in 2017 and 2018. He missed out last year, somehow, but had the second and the third. He fields four this time, with Column Of Fire perhaps looking the most likely after a fine third of 28 on his handicap debut.The Bosses Oscar and Escaria Ten also have masses of potential on their handicap debuts.</p> <p>Five O\u2019 Clock, a Grade Three winner last time, looks fairly treated and comes from the Willie Mullins yard that used to have a good record in this until Gordon came along.</p> <p>Front View has been well supported and looks like starting favourite for last year\u2019s winning team of Joseph O\u2019Brien / JP McManus / Jonjo O\u2019Neill Jr. He ran on nicely to be second behind Five O\u2019Clock and can be expected to step forward on that first outing for three months.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc4eca08057552e37597bf7b4715a199428b0e1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc4eca08057552e37597bf7b4715a199428b0e1e/0_0_1084_1300/834.jpg\" alt=\"Martin Pipe\" width=\"834\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The former racehorse trainer Martin Pipe, in whose honour today\u2019s final race is named.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Barry Batchelor/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6b6f668f085e564ad83731\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/chriscook\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-13T11:39:38.954Z\">11.39am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Grand Annual (4.50) preview</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Gordon Elliott may be the handicap king at the Festival but he hasn\u2019t won this one yet. Perhaps that\u2019s why he fields a strong duo this time in Chosen Mate, a Grade Two winner as a hurdler who has been brought along steadily over fences, and Eclair De Beaufeu, who was in the front rank when unseating in the County Hurdle a year ago.</p> <p>Eclair beat 14 rivals at Leopardstown last time and clearly has no problem with big fields. Henry de Bromhead also has an interesting pair, led by Jan Maat, who seems to have been put away for this after winning a Grade Three in October.</p> <p>He might have preferred drier ground. Paul Nicholls has won this twice in four years and tries again with Greaneteen, a winner of his last three, though the form does not look irresistibly strong. Gino Trail is 13 but was revived by a change of stable to score a fortnight ago and is 1lb lower than when second in this two years ago.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"011c5a1a92a953693c1c44be60e341e61108e491\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/011c5a1a92a953693c1c44be60e341e61108e491/0_0_3500_2287/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cheltenham Festival 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"653\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Racegoers rocking up to Cheltenham earlier this morning.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacob King/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6b6e7d8f085c6327bbf33a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/chriscook\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-13T11:39:28.801Z\">11.39am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Foxhunters Chase (4.10) preview</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Minella Rocco, who might have won the 2017 Gold Cup if they\u2019d gone a proper gallop, tries this instead. He\u2019s had problems and is not the horse he was but the market is encouraged by a couple of recent wins; they were effectively two-horses races in which his only serious rivals failed to perform, however.</p> <p>Hazel Hill, last year\u2019s winner, made it hard for himself by jumping to the right at Wetherby last time and he\u2019s older than most Foxhunter winners now.</p> <p>Billaway, for the Mullins clan, is young and progressive and won a key trial in January. Shantou Flyer, second to Hazel Hill last year, is in good form again. He was beaten just a neck in a Festival handicap in 2018 under a big weight. Caid Du Berlais comes from the same small Somerset yard as Shantou Flyer but seems to have proved he lacks the stamina for this.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"915b03d094c126598025ebc8bce186c2d8563410\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/915b03d094c126598025ebc8bce186c2d8563410/0_0_3500_2423/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Al Boum Photo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"692\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Last year\u2019s Gold Cup winner Al Boum Photo gets a run-out this morning as he prepares to defend his crown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Cooper/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6b6c558f085f0b8d947d89\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/chriscook\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-13T11:39:13.470Z\">11.39am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Gold Cup (3.30) preview</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>No horses older than nine in this Gold Cup, so there\u2019s scope for imagining that almost any of the dozen runners could put up a career best. The exception would be Bristol De Mai, or Bristol De Haydock as he is affectionately known, who would struggle to match the amazing figures he put up in beating Cue Card 57 lengths back in 2017.</p> <p>Al Boum Photo has followed the same path he took a year ago and it may be good enough for a second win. Delta Work has won five Grade Ones over fences but was a bit disappointing here in the RSA last March and must leave that behind. Santini, who was just ahead of him, beat Bristol De Mai here in January but he\u2019ll need to take the second-last more cleanly than he did that day.</p> <p>Clan Des Obeaux failed to stay last year and the odds are pretty good that he\u2019ll do something similar, this being a hot race on ground with plenty of juice in it. Kemboy hasn\u2019t shown the spark that made him so good last year, while Presenting Percy\u2019s best is also a fair time ago.</p> <p>Lostintranslation flopped in the King George but had looked the right type until then and is normally an excellent jumper. Henry de Bromhead has an interesting pair of outsiders in Monalee, unexposed at this distance, and the progressive Chris\u2019s Dream, who looks an each-way option.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b888319a5ad328635ccaae7b86f72ecfe7eafed0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b888319a5ad328635ccaae7b86f72ecfe7eafed0/0_0_3500_2383/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Best Mate\" width=\"1000\" height=\"681\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u201cYou\u2019re my Best Mate ...\u201d</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Cooper/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6b6b3b8f087df56e4c7ecc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/chriscook\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-13T11:39:04.880Z\">11.39am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Albert Bartlett (2.50) preview</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Another Friday race in which Willie Mullins has a poor record, 1/35 in this case. He\u2019s represented by the fancied Monkfish, whose stamina is proven although this is a serious step up in class.</p> <p>Mullins also runs Janidil, who might have been seen more as a handicap type. The trainer likes the fact that he is experienced, with seven runs over hurdles, but this is a big step up in trip. Thyme Hill was favourite, having won the Challow in December, but people are worried about the stable form after a couple of significant flops, and his form does not look as strong as it did.</p> <p>Latest Exhibition, another Grade One winner, has taken over at the top of the betting. Only Abacadabras has beaten him over hurdles and there\u2019s no shame in that after his close second in the Supreme this week.</p> <p>Gordon Elliott\u2019s only runner is Fury Road, who was five lengths behind Latest Exhibition last time, but someone likes him as he\u2019s shortened from 14-1 to 8-1 in the past 24 hours.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"495f15c8fa6802b18464cb7189d33a3cc994c589\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/495f15c8fa6802b18464cb7189d33a3cc994c589/0_230_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cheltenham Festival 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former Olympians Amy Williams (left), Victoria Pendleton (centre) and somebody we don\u2019t recognise but probably should (right, answers on a postcard) arrive at Prestbury Park for a day\u2019s sport.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6b6a958f085f0b8d947d74\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/chriscook\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-13T11:38:57.868Z\">11.38am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">County Hurdle (2.10) preview</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Good luck with this 26-runner handicap, which has two JP McManus-owned horses at the top of the betting. Saint Roi has crashed from 14-1 to 6-1 in the last 24 hours, having been put up by an influential tipster. That\u2019s terrible news for him because favourites have a poor record and it does not improve matters (trends-wise) that he is a handicap debutant who races prominently. But he won in a good time at Tramore and has more to offer.</p> <p>Ciel De Neige, also representing the JP/Willie Mullins team, was a good second in the Betfair Hurdle last time and is only up 4lb. From the Dan Skelton yard that has won three Countys in the past four years comes Mohaayed, the 2018 winner, back down to a beatable mark for the first time in ages. He goes well fresh and has had a wind op since he was last seen in December. Aramon, another for Mullins, has been in Grade Ones for his last eight starts. He\u2019ll travel well and the question is whether he can finish strongly enough.</p> <p>Adjali is, according to the betting, the first string of Nicky Henderson, who hasn\u2019t won this since 1997. This one became disappointing as a juvenile and has work to do on his sixth at Ascot when last seen in November. Stolen Silver, for Team Twiston-Davies, has some good form with some leading novices and was a staying-on eighth in the Betfair Hurdle.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1232790577e44d347a12692dab3c2a737e7d049b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1232790577e44d347a12692dab3c2a737e7d049b/0_53_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cheltenham Festival 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Festival organisers broadcast a message on the giant screen in the parade ring urging racegoers to wash their hands.

  "<p>Fashion operates on desire. How we dress feeds off cravings to be different as well as part of a tribe; to be en vogue but ahead of the pack. The message from the high street is that such wishes can be fulfilled, and fast fashion plays on the idea that hunger can be sated immediately. But to overcome such urges we need to reflect on the fragility of our planet. This means accepting that there is a better way to keep the pleasures of fashion open to all parts of society than promoting disposable clothes as desirable. This is not just about the high cost of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/22/cost-cheap-fast-fashion-workers-planet\" title=\"\">\u00a34 dress</a>; luxury retailers such as Louis Vuitton have offered small collections every two weeks.</p> <p>The fashion industry has benefited from globalisation to mass-produce goods by externalising the costs of production in the form of human and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/jun/23/five-ways-fashion-damages-the-planet\" title=\"\">environmental damage</a>. Every year, 100bn new garments are produced by one out of six people worldwide. Yet only 2% of them earn a living wage. In this country it is an open secret that some garment factories are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jan/23/national-shame-mp-sounds-alarm-over-uk-fast-fashion-factories\" title=\"\">not paying the minimum wage</a>.</p> <p>Fashion shouldn\u2019t cost the earth. But the industry has for too long promoted overconsumption as a good thing. About a fifth of <a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2020/02/27/fast-fashion-waste-not-shop-not/\" title=\"\">mass-produced</a> clothing does not even sell and ends up being buried, shredded or burned. Garments now account for 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Synthetic fibres are being found in Arctic sea ice and in fish.</p> <p>Britain has too readily embraced throwaway society. Shoppers in the UK buy more clothes per person than any other country in Europe. It was a mistake last year for ministers not to take up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/jun/18/ministers-reject-charge-of-1p-an-item-to-clean-up-fast-fashion\" title=\"\">MPs\u2019 suggestion</a> to reward via taxation companies that design products with lower climate footprints and penalise those that do not. Messages from public figures, such as the environmentalist Greta Thunberg, about not buying clothes has helped to persuade people to turn their backs on fast fashion. New research shows that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/mar/12/i-wear-my-grandads-old-boxers-meet-the-people-who-havent-bought-clothes-for-a-decade\" title=\"\">51% of Britons</a> are opting to purchase expensive but longer-lasting clothes rather than cheaper throwaway items, up from 33% a year ago.</p> <p>The market is belatedly responding to the mood. Big brands such as H&amp;M and Zara have made new commitments to sustainability. John Lewis has this week introduced labelling to encourage a culture of handing down children\u2019s clothes. <a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/gallery/sustainable-denim-jeans-brands\" title=\"\">Nudie Jeans </a>has become a success, with organic products and stores that promote repair services and resale.</p> <p>At no other time in human history has fashion been so accessible to so many people. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/sep/09/hi-tech-hyperlocal-and-3d-printed-a-proposition-for-the-future-of-fashion\" title=\"\">Technology will help</a> to make fashion greener. Better regulation of supply chains will help too. There is a discernible shift from discarding clothes to repairing, reusing or even renting them. However, it is hard to see how this will be enough to make fashion truly sustainable if the industry still produces more and more clothes. Once normal service is resumed, we need to think again about the wisdom of fostering competitive consumption, which upholds the persistent demand for expansion, in our society.</p>",

Why are siblings separated? Why don\u2019t children\u2019s homes feel able to offer places to the most distressed and disaffected children in the system?

  "<p>On the Monday after Jeremy Corbyn led Labour to its worst general election defeat since 1935, Lisa Nandy headed to Ashfield in Nottinghamshire to stand outside a Co-op in the December gloom. There, alongside Gloria de Piero, the local Labour MP between 2010 and 2019, she asked shoppers why so many voters had deserted Labour \u2013 the constituency now had <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/ashfield-lee-anderson-tory-wins-seat-tenants-tents-pick-potatoes-video-election-a9245001.html\">a Conservative MP</a> with a 5,733 majority.</p> \n<p>The women took a pasting. They were harangued by nurses and ex-miners who had voted Tory for the first time, believing it was their \u201cpatriotic duty\u201d to stop Corbyn from getting into No 10. Nandy made a promise to one of them, a pitman called Keith: \u201cI\u2019m going to make it my mission to win you back.\u201d</p> \n<p>Keith probably didn\u2019t know who she was. Despite serving as shadow minister for children, then charities and eventually energy, the now-40-year-old Mancunian only came to national prominence in 2016, when she was one of 20 Labour frontbenchers to quit in protest at Corbyn\u2019s leadership, going on to chair Owen Smith\u2019s doomed attempt at the top job.</p> \n<p>A few weeks after meeting Keith, Nandy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/03/lisa-nandy-enters-labour-leadership-race-with-call-for-change\">wrote a letter to the Wigan Post</a> announcing she was standing for Labour leader, warning that unless the party changed it would collapse into irrelevance.</p> \n<p>She began as the underdog and three months later she still is. By all conventional metrics, she is going to lose. She was <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/people/leadership-2020-nominations/leadership-2020/\">endorsed by fewer MPs</a>, fewer constituency Labour parties and fewer affiliate organisations than her rivals. The bookies think Keir Starmer will win by a landslide. So do the polls.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"4244b7f5-81b9-49fd-ac5d-d4045272af60\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The first stage of the contest was for potential contenders to get the backing of 22 fellow MPs by 13 January. Five MPs passed this threshold: Keir Starmer (88 nominations),&nbsp; Rebecca Long-Bailey (33), Lisa Nandy (31), Jess Phillips (23) and Emily Thornberry (23).</p>\n    <p>The second stage required each contender to win the support either of 33 constituency Labour parties (CLPs); or of three affiliates, two of which had to be unions, and which between them accounted for at least 5% of the affiliated membership. This had to be achieved before 14 February. Jess Phillips withdrew from the contest on 21 January. Emily Thornberry failed to attract the required number of members.</p>\n    <p>The ballot of members and registered supporters was due to open on 21 February, and closes at noon on 2 April. To be eligible to vote you must have been a Labour member on 20 January, or have applied to have become a \u00a325 registered supporter by 16 January.</p>\n    <p>Corbyn\u2019s successor - Starmer, Long-Bailey or Nandy - will be announced at a special conference in London on 4 April.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Many Tory MPs are hoping the bookies are right. Paul Bristow, the new MP for Peterborough, knew Nandy when they were both councillors on Hammersmith and Fulham council in London between 2006 and 2010. The Conservatives controlled the council then and she soon stepped up to be opposition spokesperson on housing. He found her \u201crefreshingly un-tribal\u201d. He thinks she might be the biggest threat to Boris Johnson.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think she\u2019s more relatable. She\u2019s got personality. She understands where Labour have gone wrong. I\u2019m certainly not scared of going out on the doorstep and competing against Sir Keir in seats like Peterborough. He\u2019s not ruled out wanting to rejoin the EU \u2026 I don\u2019t think he\u2019s got the personality that will connect with people in Peterborough. I\u2019m not in any way worried about Rebecca Long-Bailey.

She\u2019s not tainted by Corbyn and has been critical of him. I think the fact she is a northerner has a lot more cut-through.\u201d</p> \n<p>Plus there\u2019s the fact she is a mixed-race woman who held on to Wigan (63.9% leave) despite being unapologetically pro-remain (but against a second referendum and for a brexit deal) and pro-immigration \u2013 albeit on a majority cut by almost 10,000 to 6,728 \u2013 and holding a world-view that manages to mix hyperlocalism and internationalism with a healthy dollop of pragmatism.</p> \n<p>Largan cited her \u201creasonableness\u201d, which he thinks would be welcomed by a public fed up with adversarial politics: \u201cI think having a more consensual politics is what the public would quite like. They are fed up of these really toxic divisions.\u201d</p> \n<p>After she was elected to the (then) safe seat of Wigan in 2010, some Labour bigwigs were less impressed. Her experience as a London councillor, and previous work with Centrepoint, the homelessness charity, and then for the Children\u2019s Society, did not cut much ice with Sir Peter Smith, who ran Wigan council for 27 years until 2018.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4653aa3783551a665f58e6dff77edcceaf640d9a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4653aa3783551a665f58e6dff77edcceaf640d9a/0_37_6587_3954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rebecca Long-Bailey, Lisa Nandy and Keir Starmer at a hustings event.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rebecca Long-Bailey, Lisa Nandy and Keir Starmer at a hustings event.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>He has endorsed Starmer, saying Nandy \u201chas never been tested in a real job. Being a leader, particularly if you want to be prime minister, you have got to show you can take difficult decisions.\u201d</p> \n<p>Nandy was brought up in a family that pushed for change: her Kolkata-born father, Dipak Nandy, helped write Labour\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_Relations_Act_1968\" title=\"Race Relations Act 1968\">Race Relations Act</a>; her mother, Luise Fitzwalter, produced hard-hitting documentaries for Granada; and her maternal grandfather, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Byers\" title=\"Frank Byers\">Lord Byers</a>, was the leader of the Liberals in the House of Lords. She insists she was the non-academic one of the family \u2013 her sister, Francesca, went to Oxford, while she went to study politics at Newcastle \u2013 but home was always a fulcrum of debate.</p> \n<p>Balbir Chatrik, who is still Centrepoint\u2019s head of policy, said Nandy had been \u201creally passionate\u201d in trying to change the rules on homeless 16- and 17-year-olds stuck in bed and breakfast accommodation.</p> \n<p>Kathy Evans, who was head of policy at the Children\u2019s Society, gave Nandy her next job, in 2005, and remembers she was \u201cvery good at building relationships with people she disagrees with\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s got great spirit. I think I probably spent more time disagreeing with her on matters of policy than most of the rest of the team. But disagreeing well, if that makes sense; disagreeing in a way that was always thought-provoking.\u201d</p> \n<p>In Wigan town hall, Smith and Nandy disagreed often. Now, he thinks she\u2019s got her priorities all wrong. He despaired when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/13/labour-leadership-contenders-split-over-trans-group-pledge-card\">she became mired in controversy</a> after signing a pledge from the Labour Campaign for Trans Rights that vowed to expel members of some feminist groups from the party. \u201cShe\u2019s made it clear during this election what she thinks about LGBT rights, but not HS2 \u2026 HS2 is much more important,\u201d said Smith.</p> \n<p>She also irritated him by saying Tony Blair had perpetuated \u201cthe consensus that Thatcher built\u201d. \u201cAll that stuff attacking Blair \u2013 we are not going to win if we write out Blair from history. People in Leigh [Wigan\u2019s neighbour, which went Tory in December] were better off in a Blair government.\u201d</p> \n<p>Donna Hall, chief executive of Wigan council until last year, said Nandy had a \u201claser-like bullshit detector\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cShe was able on our first meeting with politicians on Wigan council to cut right through through the rhetoric, the excuses, and get right to the heart of the issues facing communities. She didn\u2019t have it easy with some of the older male Labour councillors who thought she was a young woman out of her depth. How wrong they were.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, support from other Greater Manchester grandees is conspicuous in its absence. For instance, Andy Burnham, MP for Leigh from 2005 until 2017 and now the mayor of Greater Manchester, has not endorsed anyone and says he is \u201cunclear where Lisa stands on devolution\u201d.</p> \n<p>A Nandy trademark is admitting she doesn\u2019t have all the answers. During her <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000dbdj\">BBC interview with Andrew Neil</a>, she was asked what in her CV would equip her to deal with an international crisis, after the US had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/05/making-of-a-martyr-how-qassem-suleimani-was-hunted-down\">assassinated Qassem Soleimani</a>, the leader of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.</p> \n<p>\u201cI have the humility to know that one individual can\u2019t deal with an international crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not claiming for a moment to be a greater expert than someone who has spent the last 20 years working in foreign affairs. But nor do I think that it\u2019s the job of a prime minister to pretend to have all the answers.\u201d</p> \n<p>It was a typical Nandy response, one which shows either a refreshing ability to admit her own fallibility \u2013 or a frustrating tendency to pass the buck, depending on your opinion.</p> \n<p>Last Friday teatime she was addressing a meeting in Blackburn, hastily convened by local councillors campaigning to <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/BarbaraCastle?utm_source=customer&amp;utm_medium=copy_link&amp;utm_campaign=m_pd+share-sheet\">erect a statue</a> of Barbara Castle, the town\u2019s former MP and long-serving Labour cabinet minister. Nandy launched her leadership bid in Dagenham, where female Ford workers went on strike for fair pay in 1968. Their fight was taken up by Castle, then <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Employment\">secretary of state for employment</a>, who pushed through the 1970 Equal Pay Act.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe way [Castle] conducted herself in politics, the way she heard those women and opened the door to change \u2013 that\u2019s the sort of politics that I believe in, not the sort of politics where, Churchill-like, when you get yourself elected to parliament, you decide you have all the answers and pronounce to people from the dispatch box about what those answers are,\u201d she told the Blackburn gathering.</p> \n<p>It didn\u2019t persuade everyone. One middle-aged man stood up and introduced himself as a \u201cdisillusioned Labour supporter\u201d. \u201cThe way I see it, this is all about electability. I\u2019m all for equal rights and women\u2019s rights and all that, but the people out there, the public, they need specific things,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to be a bit more specific about what my kids are going to get, in their schooling and hospitals.\u201d</p> \n<p>It was a remark that cut to a common criticism of Nandy. As one Labour MP in the north-west puts it: \u201cThe question is: is she a commentator or is she a leader? She\u2019s done really well and built a good profile for herself around towns. But what are her solutions to the problems she has diagnosed?\u201d</p> \n<p>Nandy insists she has a plan to rebuild the Labour party and win back \u201cred wall\u201d seats such as Ashfield and Leigh, by embedding Labour members in every community. She wants Labour to set up creches, credit unions and food banks to show people that Labour is a party that cares about their wellbeing rather than simply their vote. It is a laudable plan but a difficult one to execute, and many Labour members may prefer to believe that top-down policy-making will win a general election rather than hard slog on the ground. But maybe a hard slog is the only way out of the quagmire?</p> \n<h2>Potted profile</h2> \n<p><strong>Born:</strong> 9 August 1979</p> \n<p><strong>School:</strong> Parrs Wood high school in Manchester and sixth form at Holy Cross college in Bury</p> \n<p><strong>University:</strong> Newcastle University, studied politics</p> \n<p><strong>Career:</strong> Worked for the Labour MP Neil Gerrard, as a researcher at the homelessness charity Centrepoint and then as senior policy adviser at the Children\u2019s Society, where she specialised in issues facing young refugees.</p> \n<p><strong>Family:</strong> Husband Andy Collis, a public relations consultant; one son, aged four.</p> \n<p><strong>Lives:</strong> Wigan, Greater Manchester.</p>",
  "<p>It was a moment made for live cable TV. Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York state, warned on CNN on Wednesday night that coronavirus was \u201chere, it\u2019s much more prevalent than we know, you\u2019re going to see the numbers go sky high \u2013 and if the American people aren\u2019t ready for it, we are going to have a problem\u201d.</p> \n<p>Suddenly, CNN\u2019s primetime anchor, Cuomo\u2019s younger brother Chris, butted in. You could see the frown of disapproval flit across big brother\u2019s face: what was the youngster doing interrupting him like that?</p> \n<p>\u201cHold on,\u201d said Chris Cuomo, who was being fed information via his earpiece. \u201cThis is happening in real-time. The NBA has just suspended its season.\u201d</p> \n<p>There it was.</p> \n<p>The magnitude of the coronavirus threat to America, this invisible danger that nobody appears able to quantify or fully comprehend, came into blazing view. It was written across the brows of the Cuomo brothers, their split-screen expressions unified in utter disbelief that the basketball season, that national sporting institution, was off.</p> \n<p>The US has finally woken to the uncomfortable truth \u2013 this is happening. And it\u2019s happening in a country of 327 million people who are in varying degrees overwhelmingly, totally, largely or partially not ready for it.</p> \n<p>To adopt Governor Cuomo\u2019s words: America, we have a problem.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2cbb7e6cd16edbbdac5c941e211da948d67fd24d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2cbb7e6cd16edbbdac5c941e211da948d67fd24d/0_0_3408_2272/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Workers clean a subway station in Brooklyn as New York City confronts the coronavirus outbreak on March 11, 2020 in New York City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Workers clean a subway station in Brooklyn as New York City confronts the coronavirus outbreak.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There have memorably been two occasions in the past century when the United States has declared itself to be under attack on domestic territory: Pearl Harbor and 9/11. Now a third onslaught is under way on American soil and no amount of xenophobic rebranding by Donald Trump, who in his Oval Office address this week cast the disease as the \u201cforeign virus\u201d, will alter that fact.</p> \n<p>Even before the virus has taken hold in communities and cities across the country, it has been preceded by two other contagions \u2013 confusion and fear.</p> \n<p>You can see those twin pestilences sprouting furiously on both US coasts. In Bend, Oregon, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rebecca_mehra/status/1237891575897718791\">Rebecca Mehra</a>, a professional runner, related on Twitter how on her way to shop for groceries she heard a woman call to her from a car parked outside the store.</p> \n<p>The woman and her husband, both in their 80s, had been sitting in the vehicle for almost an hour, afraid to go inside for fear of exposing themselves to the virus yet unable to go home as they were running out of supplies.

  "<p>When we think of deportees, we seldom think of native Brits. But sometimes they\u2019re one and the same. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/jan/18/theatre\">Hassan Abdulrazzak</a>\u2019s theatrical documentary, six British-born almost-Americans narrate their tales of being expelled from the US after time served in prison. \u201cIs deportation a double punishment,\u201d asks Abdulrazzak, \u201cand do we care?\u201d Its protagonists certainly do, as the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency upends each of their lives in shocking and gratuitous ways.</p> <p>Esther Baker\u2019s production for <a href=\"http://www.synergytheatreproject.co.uk/\">Synergy Theatre Project</a> is part verbatim play and part satirical cabaret, with immigration officer Curtis as our sardonic MC and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay\">Theresa May</a> coupling up on the dancefloor. It\u2019s no fault of Duncan Wisbey\u2019s choice presidential impersonation, but those interludes don\u2019t fly. Its title apart, the play isn\u2019t about US/UK relations. And its point about immigration policy hardening under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/clinton\">Bill Clinton</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama\">Barack Obama</a> feels more pertinent than standard-issue Trump-bashing.</p> <p>But as Curtis, smirking Nicholas Beveney certainly brings home the inhumanity of a system run more for profit than people.

Noel Josephides, founder of Greece specialist Sunvil, said: \u201cThis is our 50th year, and for us the only thing that compares to it is the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus, when we specialised in Cyprus holidays. This is far worse because it\u2019s very uncertain. The way the government is playing it \u2013 trying to flatten out the peak \u2013 means it will continue through to June. But if it goes beyond that the whole summer will be wiped out.\u201d</p> <p>While bookings to Europe have slowed to a trickle, long-haul tour operators say there is still demand for holidays in 2021. Sam Clark of Asia specialist Experience Travel Group said: \u201cThe majority of our clients would travel at the moment but they can\u2019t because they can\u2019t get a visa,\u201d referring to restrictions put in place by India and Vietnam. India has suspended all tourist visas, effective from 13 March until 15 April, while Vietnam said UK passport holders will be unable to apply for a tourist visa for Vietnam until further notice.

By contrast, searches to destinations in Spain and Italy are down by 80%.</p> <p>UK tourist boards are also encouraging hotels to be flexible about booking policies. Deirdre Wells, chief executive of Visit Kent and Visit Hertfordshire, said: \u201cWe are encouraging them [hotels] around cancellation policies.

  "<p>How is US Soccer going to get itself out of this mess?</p> <p>While the new coronavirus is upending much of the sports world, US Soccer has been unraveled by its own sexism and arrogance, culminating Thursday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/13/carlos-cordeiro-quits-us-soccer-federation-after-row-over-female-players\">in the sudden resignation of the federation\u2019s president</a>, Carlos Cordeiro.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/13/carlos-cordeiro-quits-us-soccer-federation-after-row-over-female-players\">Carlos Cordeiro quits US Soccer Federation after row over female players</a> </p> </aside>  <p>US Soccer\u2019s latest misstep? An appalling admission in legal filings that the federation views its female athletes as inherently inferior to their male counterparts.</p> <p>In response to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/mar/08/usa-womens-team-sues-us-soccer-pay-equality\">the wage discrimination lawsuit</a> filed by the US women\u2019s national team, the federation argued Monday that women have less \u201cability\u201d than men because ability is based on \u201cthe level of certain physical attributes, such as speed and strength\u201d. The federation\u2019s male attorney went on to write that playing for the men\u2019s team \u201crequires a higher level of skill\u201d and it wasn\u2019t \u201ca sexist stereotype\u201d but \u201cindisputable science\u201d.</p> <p>In other words, US Soccer tried to justify paying women less based on the same misogyny spewed by Twitter trolls to demean female athletes every day. Of all the ways US Soccer could\u2019ve defended itself, it chose to say the women don\u2019t deserve equal pay because they aren\u2019t equal.</p> <p>The criticism was swift. First it was former players, such as Heather O\u2019Reilly, who wrote that \u201cto read that US Soccer thinks this of the USWNT and female athletes in general is disgusting and disturbing to me\u201d. Then came the sponsors, with Coca-Cola, Visa, Deloitte and Budweiser calling it \u201cunacceptable\u201d and \u201coffensive\u201d. The players on the USWNT engaged in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/12/uswnt-protest-equal-pay-shebelieves-cup\">a silent protest before a game Wednesday night</a>.</p> <p>There\u2019s never a good time to weaponize misogyny and demean women everywhere, but the timing perfectly illustrated the way US Soccer has historically wanted to have it both ways, patting itself on the back for its support of women while quietly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/21/jill-ellis-uswnt-salary-womens-world-cup-soccer\">applying double standards in other ways</a>. The sexist legal filing came amid the SheBelieves Cup and the SheBelieves Summit, the federation\u2019s attempt to promote female empowerment.</p> <p>That\u2019s why Cordeiro\u2019s resignation, as necessary as it may have been, does little to fix anything.</p> <p>US Soccer\u2019s unconscionable legal strategy was not Cordeiro\u2019s doing, and it wasn\u2019t something that emerged for the first time this week. It was a strategy presumably executed at the direction of several high-ranking officials at US Soccer. Megan Rapinoe said the team long felt an \u201cundercurrent\u201d of disrespect from their boss but the legal filing just proved it.</p> <p>Federation lawyers last year grilled Carli Lloyd and Alex Morgan in depositions about whether they could beat boys at soccer. At one point, an attorney asked: \u201cDo you think you could be competitive against the senior men\u2019s national team?\u201d to which Lloyd replied: \u201cShall we fight it out to see who wins and then we get paid more?\u201d</p> <p>Other employees and board members who remain at US Soccer knew exactly the federation\u2019s legal counsel was doing and apparently thought it was a fine strategy. The months-long process of building a legal defense doesn\u2019t occur in a vacuum.</p> <p>To be clear, US Soccer <em>does</em> support its women\u2019s team better than perhaps any other federation in the world does. In some ways, the USWNT\u2019s continued success is a product of that support and investment.</p> <p>But the federation\u2019s attitude that the women ought to be thankful for whatever they get is nothing new \u2013 that\u2019s what the federation said back in the 1990s, when <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/National-Team-Updated-Expanded-Changed/dp/1419743015/\">the women were paid $10 per day</a> and had to work side jobs to support their love of their sport.</p> <p>US Soccer is an organization that is, in some ways, entrenched in what it was when the USWNT first started in 1985 and the players <a href=\"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-national-team-caitlin-murray/1130471569?ean=9781419743016#/\">wore hand-me-down men\u2019s jerseys</a>. It\u2019s grown massively over the years into an entity that employs hundreds of full-time and part-time staff and will spend around $143m this year on operations. But that growth has just been added onto what US Soccer always been and how it\u2019s always done things, with its most influential figures also some of its longest-tenured.</p> <p>There was hope that with Cordeiro at the helm that could start to change. In the past year, longtime CEO Dan Flynn stepped down, followed by string-puller CMO Jay Berhalter. Kate Markgraf, who hadn\u2019t been afraid to criticize the federation <a href=\"https://www.foyles.co.uk/witem/sport-hobbies/the-national-team-the-inside-story-of-t,caitlin-murray-9781419734496\">in the past</a>, was hired as the GM for women\u2019s programming.</p> <p>But since Cordeiro took over in 2018 from former president Sunil Gulati, who didn\u2019t run for re-election after the US men <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/10/usa-trinidad-and-tobago-world-cup-2018-qualifier-soccer\">failed to qualify for the World Cup</a>, reforms have been slow and tepid. Cordeiro, as well-intentioned as he may have been, appeared too eager to defer to the expertise of the people around him \u2013 many of the same people who had been at the federation far too long and were resistant to change.</p> <p>The federation has made efforts to <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/reforms-planned-after-internal-criticism-leads-to-wake-up-call-for-us-soccer-183357300.html\">boost morale at US Soccer House</a>, but the mess of the past week surely tanked it again. After all, every woman there must have heard what US Soccer thinks of them \u2013 and what kind of man wants to work at an organization labeled as sexist?</p> <p>Now, the VP candidate that sources say Cordeiro favored, Cindy Parlow Cone, has abruptly been thrown into the president role. Parlow Cone, a former USWNT midfielder, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/caitlinmurr/status/1238156875893366785\">spoke out publicly</a> against US Soccer\u2019s sexist legal strategy hours before Cordeiro resigned, calling it \u201ctroubling\u201d. Now, she\u2019ll be at the helm until February 2021, when someone else can be elected to take over Cordeiro\u2019s term, and she\u2019ll serve as US Soccer\u2019s first female president.</p> <p>There\u2019s not a question of Parlow Cone\u2019s capabilities but of how much she\u2019ll embrace the job at a time when the federation lacks direction and leadership. The presidential position is unpaid but heavily involved \u2013 another sign that US Soccer has failed to evolve past its quaint beginnings \u2013 and the volunteer VP role she signed up for was very much part-time.</p> <p>What US Soccer needs is a much larger overhaul. Heather O\u2019Reilly, who was on the Athlete Council that voted for Cordeiro, said US Soccer should go through \u201ca lengthy process of reorganization\u201d. She\u2019s right, but the federation has resisted it for this long \u2013 why should anything change now?</p> <p>Maybe, just maybe, the situation is dire enough that now is the time for true reform and a shift in culture. After all, it\u2019s hard to imagine it can get any worse.</p>",
  "<p>With an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 coronavirus cases <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-as-many-as-10000-in-britain-may-already-have-it-says-pm\">now present in the UK</a>, the government has eschewed social distancing measures such as closing schools and banning large <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-51835762\">sporting events</a>. Instead, it has opted for behavioural \u201cnudges\u201d: wash your hands, don\u2019t touch your face, don\u2019t shake hands with others, stay at home if you feel ill, and self-isolate if you have a continuous cough.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/uk-governments-coronavirus-advice-and-why-it-gave-it\">This approach differs starkly</a> from the quarantine measures taken in China, South Korea, Italy and Iran. But it also marks the UK out as different from countries such as Ireland, Norway and Denmark, which have implemented school closures despite seeing only a relatively small number of coronavirus cases. Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, has explained that part of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-science-chief-defends-uk-measures-criticism-herd-immunity\">reason for not embracing bans</a> is to encourage \u201cherd immunity\u201d. Allow enough of those who can survive coronavirus disease to get infected, and the virus won\u2019t have new people to infect, meaning new cases will dry up. Other European countries seem to have judged this too bold an approach. Immunity will probably be temporary, so later outbreaks are to be expected, and dealt with by heightened <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/02/covid-vaccine/607000/\">contact tracing when they occur</a>.</p> <p>The UK government\u2019s strategy is influenced by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2017/feb/22/nudge-theory-the-psychology-and-ethics-of-persuasion-science-weekly-podcast\">nudge theory</a>, an idea first popularised by the behavioural economist Richard Thaler and political scientist Cass Sunstein. \u201cNudging\u201d uses insights about our mental processes to change our behaviour through coaxing and positive assertion. Rather than forcing us to do things, nudging tweaks the environments in which we make choices \u2013 for example by requiring people to opt out of organ donation, rather than opting in.</p> <p>Perhaps most importantly of all, nudge thinking has informed what the UK is <em>not</em> doing. As stressed by the government and David Halpern, leader of the behavioural insights team (aka the \u201cnudge unit\u201d) that is playing a big role in advising the government\u2019s response, the reason that it isn\u2019t yet time to close schools or ban large gatherings is that \u201cfatigue\u201d could set in \u2013 meaning people will grow tired of the bans and find ways around them. If the effectiveness of social distancing measures is time-limited, the logic seems to be, better to reserve these measures for when we\u2019re closer to the peak of the epidemic.</p> <p>The government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/12/trumps-travel-ban-wont-have-much-impact-on-spread-of-coronavirus-says-rishi-sunak-live-news\">press conference on Thursday</a> featured other more subtle nudges too. Boris Johnson was flanked and followed by his scientific advisers, a visual reinforcement of the message that the government is trusting the science \u2013 and knows what it\u2019s doing. But the UK\u2019s strategy is an outlier. If the nudgers have got it right, why are so many other countries taking a very different view of the \u201cscience\u201d? The predictions about fatigue setting in, on the face of it, seem dubious. We might get tired of bans on large gatherings such as gigs, concerts and sporting events, or school closures, but we can\u2019t circumvent them; and nothing we might do has the same capacity for \u201csuper-spreading\u201d the virus to large numbers at once. And if we are prone to fatigue, why rely on the one thing we <em>can</em> ignore \u2013 advice about hand washing?</p> <p>The government\u2019s strategy has at its heart predictions about human behaviour. Predictions are based on analysing past episodes of human behaviour, a process that is often fraught with error, to draw inferences about future behaviour, which can be highly uncertain. Which analyses of human behaviour are government scientists relying on? And how comparable are they? Why is fatigue such a problem for new coronavirus measures, which we might expect would command the same kind of support as a war effort, when the state lives with this \u201cfatigue\u201d in the design of the laws and norms that permanently regulate our lives?</p> <p>We can\u2019t answer these questions, because the government\u2019s scientists aren\u2019t yet disclosing what studies and past evidence underpin their current approach. The government\u2019s tactic \u2013 one might even call it a nudge \u2013 is to appeal to the credentials of its advisers and behavioural scientists, and to trust the experts.</p> <p>Halpern\u2019s behavioural insights team, which was created in 2010 by the coalition government as a company part-owned by the UK Cabinet Office, counts some successes \u2013 including encouraging more black and minority ethnic police recruits and coaxing high earners to pay more tax. And there are weightier pieces of evidence in the epidemiology literature to suggest that fatigue is a genuine problem \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4631512/\">for example,</a> research shows that media messages about flu have a diminishing effect on human behaviour. But we can\u2019t tell what role studies like this are playing in government thinking, and such studies lead us back to the same conundrum: if we are prone to fatigue, why rely on nudges, and why delay less easily disregarded and legalised social distancing?</p> <p>The approaches in the UK and the rest of Europe are starkly different, and both cannot be right. Mistakes by one country are going to spill over into outcomes for another. Nowhere will this be more clear than in Ireland: north of the Irish border, UK schools are open and citizens are being nudged in the fashion of \u201ckeep calm and wash your hands\u201d. South of the border, schools are closed \u2013 and nudges aren\u2019t considered a sufficient response.</p> <p>The Vote Leave campaign that Johnson led implored us to ignore the economic consensus about the likely effects of Brexit. The government he is leading now is reversing course and imploring us to listen to the experts \u2013 in this case, experts on behavioural science. We might be nudged further towards heeding the advice of Johnson and his team were their evidence base for Britain\u2019s divergent coronavirus response shared with the public.</p> <p>\u2022 Tony Yates is a former professor of economics at Birmingham University.

  "<p>I think of herbs as like a group of friends.</p> <p>Parsley, the one everyone likes, who holds the crew together. Mint is sparky, always first on the dancefloor. Coriander splits opinion, isn\u2019t to everyone\u2019s taste. Basil is a lovable extrovert and livens things up. Tarragon is opinionated, and usually best in small doses. Dill is another live wire, also best in short bursts unless you really want to party. But, together, the group is a perfect blend.</p> <p>Using herbs bravely, in large quantities, is the best way to eat them \u2013 think tabbouleh, piles of herbs next to Vietnamese pancakes, delicate omelettes aux fines herbes. If you dislike one, leave it out and add more of another: this is your dinner. I, however, am friends with them all.</p> <h2>Tarragon, <strong>shallot and cheese tart (pictured above)</strong></h2> <p>Filling and fresh all at once, a slice of this is my dream lunch.

Start by mixing the flour, salt and thyme, then pulse in the processor or mix with a wooden spoon. Add the butter and either pulse or rub with your fingers until you have a rough breadcrumb consistency. Add the water, drop by drop, pulsing or mixing each time, until the mixture forms a dough. Shape into a disc, wrap in baking paper and refrigerate for 30 minutes or so.</p> <p>Once the pastry is chilled, roll it out on a floured surface into a 3mm-thick large disc just wider than a 24cm, loose-bottomed, fluted tart tin. Roll the pastry on to a rolling pin and lay it over the tart tin. Push the pastry into the edges of the tinwith your fingers, then put back in the fridge .</p> <p>Pop it into the fridge for another 10 minutes if you have the time. Heat the oven to 210C (190C fan)/gas 7.</p> <p>Cover the pastry with baking paper and fill with baking beans , rice or old dried beans to weigh it down. No need to trim the sides yet (I do this at the end, as that way you\u2019ll be sure your pastry doesn\u2019t shrink down). Bake for 15 minutes, then remove from the oven, lift out the beans and paper, brush the pastry with a little beaten egg and return to the oven for 10-15 minutes. When it\u2019s ready, take it out, and leave the oven on. Once cooled, trim the edges of the pastry with a sharp knife so you get a nice flat edge to your tart before you add the filling.</p> <p>Meanwhile, make the filling. Heat a splash of olive oil in a large pan, add the shallots and cook for eight to 10 minutes on a medium heat, stirring occasionally, until soft and sweet. Set aside to cool.</p> <p>Break the eggs into a measuring jug and beat well. Pour in the milk, add a good pinch of salt and pepper, a grating of nutmeg (about a quarter of a seed) and the grated cheese, and mix.</p> <p>Once the shallots are cool, fold them into the egg mixture, add the herbs and mix well. Put the tart tin on a baking tray (to catch any leaks), pour the filling into the blind-baked pastry case and level the top. Grate over a generous layer of cheese, and bake for 30-35 minutes, until golden and just set.</p> <h2><strong>Herby salad with crisp garlic</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"275ea2f956620f73cec379971632c5ffda21b587\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/275ea2f956620f73cec379971632c5ffda21b587/0_0_4000_4012/997.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Jones\u2019 herb salad with crisp garlic.\" width=\"997\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anna Jones\u2019 herb salad with crisp garlic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Russell/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I buy herbs at my local greengrocer, where the bunches are bigger, better and cheaper than in supermarkets.

The <a href=\"https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2020/03/06/pandemic/\">Prison Policy Initiative</a> called for the release of medically fragile and older adults.</p> <p>These groups also highlighted that outbreaks in prisons can radiate to the outside through visitors, correctional officers and lawyers.</p> <p>Rich said an easy fix to reduce the risks is to release people who are only incarcerated because of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/25/bernie-sanders-cash-bail-bill-seeks-to-end-modern-day-debtors-prisons\">cash bail</a>, a payment to the court required to leave jail while awaiting a hearing.</p> <p>\u201cThey are not there because we need to keep society safe, they are there because they are too poor to afford bail,\u201d Rich said. \u201cIf they were wealthy, they would have the means. So, do we think we should keep them in there in the face of this epidemic?\u201c</p> <p>If measures aren\u2019t taken to reduce the risk in prisons, it could place a burden on the healthcare system, which is already under threat from the spread of coronavirus.</p> <p>There are about 2.8 hospital beds per 1,000 people in the US, compared with 12 per 1,000 people in South Korea, which seems to have mitigated the impact of coronavirus.</p> <p>People in jail and prison have underlying health conditions at higher rates than the general population, a risk factor for coronavirus. Both jails and prisons have a 1.3% prevalence of HIV compared to 0.4% in the US generally. In state prisons, 64.7% of people smoke and in federal prisons, 45.2% of people smoke, compared with 21.2% across the US.</p> <p>Coronavirus death rates are the worst in people 60 and older and the US prison population has been ageing for the past two decades. From 1990 to 2012, the US prison population aged 55 or older increased by 550%.</p> <p>\u201cWhen this thing pops as we think it might, and really becomes deeply ingrained, we\u2019re going to start filling up ICU beds,\u201d Rich said. \u201cThis is about your parents or grandparents not being able to get into an ICU bed either because they have coronavirus beds or because they have something else.\u201d</p> <p>Rich said the number one change people can make to minimize this threat is simply to reduce the number of imprisoned people.

Taiwan, with a population of almost 24 million, currently conducts only around 800 screenings a day and not everyone under quarantine is tested.</p> <p>There will be more and more confirmed cases as the US and other countries conduct more tests, Chan added.</p> <p>For Bryant, who is temporarily in the country while en route to Canada, he is happy to wait out his quarantine. He is fine with authorities tracking his movement for now, but he expresses slight concern about the \u201cbig brother\u201d implication. Taiwanese officials say it is legal, assuring that they are tracking individuals only during the period of mandatory quarantine.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not using any advanced surveillance technology. It\u2019s simply tracking based on their phone\u2019s sim cards and their nearby base stations,\u201d said cabinet spokeswoman Kolas.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to protect the person as well as others in Taiwan,\u201d she said. \u201cTo prevent more infections and fatalities, it\u2019s a measure we have to take.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>In the 22nd Biennale of Sydney, theme is everything. Curated by the Indigenous artist Brook Andrew, the title is Nirin \u2013 a Wiradjuri word meaning \u201cedge\u201d \u2013 with the accompanying public program titled Nirin Wir,<em> </em>or \u201cedge of the sky\u201d.</p> <p>With more than 100 artists and collectives from 36 countries, the coherence of the theme is the key to making sense of the various approaches, attitudes and ideas circulating throughout six venues: Cockatoo Island, the Museum of Contemporary Art, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the National Art School and Artspace in Sydney, and Campbelltown Arts Centre on the south-western edge of the city.</p> <p>But to appreciate the BoS\u2019s current form, it\u2019s important to understand its recent history.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cd7a8cc00b586f206e4d37770922d85579053de1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd7a8cc00b586f206e4d37770922d85579053de1/457_0_2380_2381/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brook Andrew, curator of the 2020 Biennale of Sydney\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brook Andrew, the curator of the 2020 Biennale of Sydney.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Trent Walker</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2014, the biennale was rocked by protests from artists over connections <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/dec/18/australian-art-in-2014-the-year-of-protest-politics-and-power-games\">between the organisation and its corporate sponsors</a>.

While the number of venues has remained more or less constant, some aspects of the BoS have either been downplayed or eliminated entirely.</p> <p>There have been fewer big-name international artists, with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/16/sydney-biennale-review-from-ai-weiweis-refugee-journey-to-silent-orchestras\">Chinese superstar artist Ai Wei Wei</a> a conspicuous anomaly among many lesser known artists in 2018.</p> <p> For 2020 the BoS is an even more modest affair. There are no art superstars, few media-friendly eye-catching works, and although a catalogue is promised to appear in time for the opening weekend, there aren\u2019t any conventional wall texts: just an information sheet on an Officeworks clipboard pegged to the wall.</p> <p>You might say this is all irrelevant to the exhibition itself, and in many ways it is. But it\u2019s also intentional. This BoS sets out to give voice to the artists of colour and of First Nations who have been marginalised by a Eurocentric art world obsessed with fame and money. The unnecessary expense of past events has now been replaced with a virtuous negation. And with the first Aboriginal artist/curator in the history of the BoS at its helm, the show has a mission.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9d9c6bc47b3e97ef6b4b8660e94e0c8baf6e05e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d9c6bc47b3e97ef6b4b8660e94e0c8baf6e05e6/0_0_8688_5792/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Progress installation view at the Museum of Contemporary Art\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Progress installation view at the Museum of Contemporary Art.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zan Wimberley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Andrew, Nirin proposes that \u201ccreativity is an important means of truth-telling, of directly addressing unresolved anxieties that stalk our times and ourselves. More importantly, it is a place from which to see the world through different eyes, to embrace our many edges and imagine pride in sociologically and harmonious self-defined futures.\u201d</p> <p>So how do these ideas actually play out in the exhibition?</p> <p>At Campbelltown Arts Centre, the uniting logic of the selection is to explore the archive of Indigenous histories, from photojournalism and street posters to various approaches to auto-ethnography.</p> <p>One of the standout works is Barbara McGrady\u2019s Our Ancestors Are Always Watching (2020), a multiscreen video installation of densely collaged photos, music and text.</p> <p>As a Gomeroi <em>yinah</em> (woman), McGrady\u2019s photojournalism has recorded the variety of Aboriginal experience through, as the artist puts it, a \u201cblack lens\u201d. One part of the text in the video states: \u201cWHEN SOME ARTS ELITIST SAYS YOU ARE ONLY A SPORTS PHOTOGRAPHER \u2026 IT\u2019S MORE THAN SPORT.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e99523dfd8ace4f57b4958d82beca289aaa859f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e99523dfd8ace4f57b4958d82beca289aaa859f/0_0_6703_4419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barbara Grady\u2019s Our Ancestors Are Always Watching video at Campbelltown Arts Centre\" width=\"1000\" height=\"659\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barbara McGrady\u2019s Our Ancestors Are Always Watching (2020) at Campbelltown Arts Centre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zan Wimberley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The declarative tone and didacticism of McGrady\u2019s video is like many other works across Nirin, on the one hand declaring its cultural importance and relevance, while on the other refuting the very world in which the show operates.</p> <p>Artists working in more subtle, metaphoric ways were, for this viewer at least, far more successful.</p> <p>At the National Art School, Mexican artist Teresa Margolles has installed Untitled (2020) which features a blood red curtain creating a long, rectangular room. Inside is a heated metal plate onto which drops of water fall from above. When the droplets hit the surface they evaporate in a puff of steam, but leave a mark.</p> <p>The work is a powerful memorial for Mexico\u2019s murdered women who number in the hundreds every month.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cb694bb36ab98f5b83c8ab82d8f905638e99c6fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb694bb36ab98f5b83c8ab82d8f905638e99c6fa/0_0_8836_5884/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Untitled (2020) by Teresa Margolles\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A powerful memorial for Mexico\u2019s murdered women who number in the hundreds every month\u2019: Untitled (2020) by Teresa Margolles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zan Wimberley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A similar approach can be found at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Aziz Hazara\u2019s five-channel video Bow Echo (2019). In it, Hazara, from Kabul, deals with the problem of representation: how does one effectively represent horror, anguish and violence?</p> <p>Hazara applies the question to the wave of suicide bombings that have taken place in Kabul over the last two decades; he presents five small boys atop a high mountain peak, Kabul city laid out behind them. The boys blow toy trumpets, the score of the video pounding out an ominous deep tone.</p> <p>Without knowing the background of the work, the video is undeniably effective; its reference points make it devastating.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7be616619b85043a86cf100bc06e0a4cb259ef78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7be616619b85043a86cf100bc06e0a4cb259ef78/0_0_4916_3069/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aziz Hazara\u2019s Bow Echo (2019)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"624\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aziz Hazara\u2019s Bow Echo (2019): \u2018The video is undeniably effective; its reference points make it devastating.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ken Leanfore</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the Art Gallery of NSW, the theme of \u201cedge\u201d places a counter-history of art right in the middle of the European tradition. Curator Brook Andrew has created a version of his own work from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/nov/23/asia-pacific-triennial-8-review-a-colourful-snapshot-of-the-world\">2015 Asia Pacific Triennial</a>. But where in Queensland, Andrew had placed his own large canvases into the gallery\u2019s colonial art collection, here at the AGNSW a variety of work by other artists have been placed among the often-visited collection of colonial pastoral scenes, monumental history pictures of battles and explorers and marble busts of notable grandees.</p> <p>The results are mixed \u2013 some of the dissonance is effective, at other times baffling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38b70f57a080222bab37edfbb8c8b45e1856df2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38b70f57a080222bab37edfbb8c8b45e1856df2e/0_0_8528_5589/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Installation view (2020) photographed in the Grand Courts at the Art Gallery of New South Wales\" width=\"1000\" height=\"655\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There Might Be No Other Place In The World As Good As Where I Am Going to Take You by Jo\u00ebl Andrianomearisoa (2020)</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zan Wimberley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Andrew has made another gesture that pretty much claims the entire biennale as a work of his own. Using the pseudonym Powerful Objects, he has placed a variety of archival objects from private and museum collections through all of the venues.</p> <p>In some cases, this elegantly extends the new works into a wider historical perspective, but just as often it\u2019s confusing, clouding the reading of the actual BoS works without any clear definition between who did what, and why.</p> <p>Cockatoo Island has become the BoS\u2019s key venue, its major industrial spaces and decrepit small rooms a challenge to any artist who works there. The Nirin theme there is largely inconsistent and disparate, but at a push one might consider it as the place where the edge ceases to be a metaphor and becomes literal \u2013 can you find all the art without a map?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7197b27756a5aecc3447a15044552f2e04ff5949\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7197b27756a5aecc3447a15044552f2e04ff5949/0_0_8987_5925/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ibrahim Mahama\u2019s No Friend but the Mountains (2012-2020)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"659\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ibrahim Mahama\u2019s No Friend but the Mountains (2012-2020).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zan Wimberley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One standout work I did find was Algerian-French artist Mohammed Bourouissa\u2019s Brutal Family Roots (2020), which belies its title and offers the visitor a gorgeous wattle-yellow zone to chill out in, to smell the flowers and listen to lovely ambient music. Creating connections between language, music and cultures, the work operates on the same metaphorical level as Nirin\u2019s best works.</p> <p>Which is not to say some tougher aesthetics don\u2019t go a long way too. Tucked in a corner at Woolloomooloo\u2019s Artspace \u2013 where the theme is collaboration and connection \u2013 is the work of Tennant Creek Brio: a group of Aboriginal men who live in the remote Northern Territory and make anarchic art: paint-covered pokie machines and canvases featuring mysterious, heraldic figures.</p> <p>A video plays on a pokie screen showing the artists working in their studio, driving around at night, and dancing. It looks like a lot of fun, and so is the art.</p>",

What they got was a sense of urgency which we have not heard up until now. In short, the meeting\u2019s participants concluded that Germany is now in crisis mode, with a plan to be unrolled with immediate effect to restructure the country\u2019s hospitals in order to boost the number of intensive care beds (currently there are 28,000 of them, 25,000 of which are equipped with respiratory apparatus). All non-urgent operations are to be postponed. The state will offer financial help to the health insurance companies to ensure this happens, Merkel said. </p> \n  <p>She appealed to Germans to restrict social contact as much as possible. She also advised on the cancellation of all gatherings which are not strictly necessary. She said the next \u201c4, 5 weeks\u201d would be \u201cvery very crucial in determining the question as to what happens next\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Markus S\u00f6der, premier of Bavaria and the leader of the Christian Social Union in Bavaria, admitted that the situation was \u201cfar more dramatic than we had thought even one or two weeks ago\u201d. He said that the government\u2019s quick introduction of so-called \u2018Kurzarbeit\u2019 - or work reduction policies introduced at the height of the banking crisis, which ensure workers receive their wages, and see employers compensated by the state \u201csend an important signal to German businesses\u201d. He coined a phrase used by Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank at the height of the Euro crisis, \u201cwe will do whatever it takes\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Although many Germans had hoped or expected they might do, the leaders did not decide on:</p> \n  <p>- a universal policy on closing schools, kindergartens and universities, although S\u00f6der did announce this evening that Bavaria (which currently has 500 people with coronavirus, and one death) will do so from tomorrow, becoming the first state to do so.</p> \n  <p>- Neither did it decide on the closure of German borders (though it will control them including checking temperatures).</p> \n  <p>- Neither did it decide to stop flights to and from Italy.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6aa40f8f087df56e4c79d8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/deniscampbell\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T21:10:08.850Z\">9.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Should schools in Britain shut? Interestingly, although other countries such as Italy and Ireland are doing that, there appears to be no groundswell of medical or scientific opinion in the UK that it should follow suit. </p> \n  <p>There are slightly mixed opinions among experts surveyed by the Science Media Centre (<a href=\"https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/\">https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/</a>), but no one urging immediate closures like those seen elsewhere. </p> \n  <p>\u201cNot closing schools seems understandable to me\u201d, said Dr Jennifer Rohn, a cell biologist at University College London. \u201cChildren will be the least likely to be affected and therefore the least likely to be shedding virus, which is directly proportional to more serious symptoms. In contrast, if you close schools you\u2019re keeping a very large number of parents away from work. As long as it is deemed feasible to keep workplaces open, it\u2019s probably better not to harm the economy further in this way.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, is more sceptical. \u201cI would like to see a bit more about why they\u2019re not closing schools and banning large events. We do know, in general, that school holidays lead to a marked reduction of transmission in infections and at the end of school holidays, infection rates take off. Every mother and father knows that when kids go back to school they\u2019re going to get hammered by colds and flus and sore throats.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He would like to know more about how ministers and government advisers reached their decision. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s based on good quality science. But we don\u2019t know what that science is. The science isn\u2019t being shared with us in a way that makes it easy for us to understand the logical basis for all of this. I would hope that more of the information and science that the government is relying on to make these decisions would be made available so we could interrogate it and see if it\u2019s valid.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Dr Charlotte Jackson, from the UCL Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology, points out that school closures have proven effective against outbreaks in the past. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThere are examples from the UK and elsewhere of school closures reducing transmission of influenza. During the 2009 flu pandemic, the UK saw a reduction in cases following the closure of schools for the summer holiday, and an increase when schools reopened in the autumn. There are also studies from various other settings, including France, Hong Kong and Mexico, suggesting reductions in transmission of seasonal or pandemic influenza associated with school closures. Social distancing measures in general did seem to slow down transmission in US cities during the 1918 flu pandemic\u201d, she says. </p> \n  <p>However, that does not mean that they would help delay the spread of the Coronavirus, she adds. \u201cWith the current coronavirus outbreak, countries have generally used lots of control measures at the same time (this also happened during the 1918 flu pandemic) so it\u2019s difficult to separate any effects of school closures from other interventions. I wouldn\u2019t like to comment definitively on whether closures would be effective for this particular virus.\u201d </p> \n  <p>What about Boris Johnson\u2019s new policy of advising schools against overseas trips? Deenan Pillay, professor of virology at UCL, says: \u201cBanning overseas school trips is a difficult one, but remember that any trips involve groups of people going to airports, going on boats and coaches and living together, and since this virus is ubiquitous now, anything like that is likely to increase acquisition of the virus. We know that children are less likely to get severe disease from coronavirus, but they nevertheless are likely, if they do get infection, to spread to others. It\u2019s a sensible measure before closing the schools\u201d. <br></p> \n  <p>(With thanks to the Science Media Centre). <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6aa0868f08c2df6d27896b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T20:59:37.721Z\">8.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A further update from Spain: The government has announced that another member of the cabinet has tested positive for coronavirus.

Rita and I are down here in Australia. We felt a bit tired, like we had colds, and some body aches. Rita had some chills that came and went. Slight fevers too. To play things right, as is needed in the world right now, we were tested for the Coronavirus, and were found to be positive. Well, now. What to do next? The Medical Officials have protocols that must be followed. We Hanks\u2019 will be tested, observed, and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires. Not much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no? We\u2019ll keep the world posted and updated. Take care of yourselves!
