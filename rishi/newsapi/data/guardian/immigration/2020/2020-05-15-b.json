study as a key tool in the fight against the coronavirus</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Spanish government has hailed a large-scale antibody study as a key tool in the fight against the coronavirus, but warned that any premature or irresponsible relaxation of restrictions could have \u201cenormous consequences\u201d given that only 5% of Spaniards have had the disease.<br></p> \n  <p>The country\u2019s Socialist-led coalition government is under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/spain-path-out-of-covid-lockdown-complicated-by-polarised-politics\">growing pressure from political opponents to end the two-month state of emergency</a> that underpins one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe.</p> \n  <p>On Friday, the health ministry was due to decide whether the Madrid region would be granted permission to follow other areas into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/global-report-spain-and-italy-grapple-with-how-to-end-covid-19-lockdown\">next stage of the de-escalation</a>, which allows up to 10 people to meet and permits the reopening of cafe and restaurant terraces at 50% capacity.</p> \n  <p>Pedro Duque, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/06/new-spanish-pm-appoints-astronaut-pedro-duque-science-minister\">former astronaut who serves as Spain\u2019s science minister</a>, told the Guardian that the preliminary results of a nationwide serological study published earlier this week would be crucial to the government\u2019s response.</p> \n  <p>The <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-05-14/antibody-study-shows-just-5-of-spaniards-have-contracted-the-coronavirus.html\">study, which involved more than 60,000 people</a>, revealed that around 5% of the population \u2013 about 2 million people \u2013 had had the coronavirus. It also showed that 33% of those who had caught the virus had not shown any symptoms.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe think that the seroprevalence test we\u2019ve carried out is the best that\u2019s been done anywhere in the world so far. The most important conclusion we\u2019ve reached is that it is vital to keep acting very prudently when it comes to this illness \u2013 there are still a lot of people who haven\u2019t been exposed to the virus,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>Duque said the pronounced geographical variations underscored the need for a region-by-region loosening of restrictions: while Murcia, Melilla, Asturias and the Canary islands showed an infection rate of less than 2%, the proportion rose to more than 10% in the regions of Madrid and Castilla-La Mancha.</p> \n  <p>\u201cRight now, the only way to act is by making small changes when it comes to relaxing the conditions, by maintaining the distances between people, and by keeping up with the infection precautions,\u201d he added.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe consequences of acting irresponsibly could be enormous given that we know that only 5% of the population has some degree of immunity against the virus. That means that 95% don\u2019t.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Duque also dismissed talk of so-called \u201cimmunity passports\u201d to allow more freedom of movement to those who had recovered from the disease.

Details on the precise implementation of the rules is to follow, but the western state of North Rhine Westphalia already applied them on the stroke of midnight on Friday.</p> \n  <p>Germans are closely watching the gradual easing of travel restrictions wanting to know to what extent they can hope to go on a foreign holiday this year. From May, 25 flights between Germany and Greece will resume. But officially the advice remains that Germans should not travel anywhere abroad, until at least 14 June.</p> \n  <p>On Monday Heiko Maas, the foreign minister, will hold a video conference with his counterparts from European countries where Germans typically go on holiday, including Spain, Italy, Austria, Greece, Croatia, Portugal, Malta, Slovenia, Cyprus and Bulgaria. The aim is to facilitate a coordinated reopening of borders including mutual agreements on being able to swiftly close them again in case of a rise in cases.</p> \n  <p>On Wednesday, the interior minister, Horst Seehofer, announced that an opening of the borders with France, Switzerland and Austria was on the cards from 15 June. On Wednesday, border traffic between Germany and Luxembourg is due to normalise again. Discussions with Denmark are still ongoing.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T13:31:26.329Z\">at 2.31pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe895b8f0849a584fe11e4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T12:30:58.134Z\">1.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d449499bdbd6a41bba2045349f8c1b558c21f8a9\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d449499bdbd6a41bba2045349f8c1b558c21f8a9/0_44_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Health workers in the Take Care of Care movement protest in Liege against the Belgian authorities\u2019 management of coronavirus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Health workers in the Take Care of Care movement protest in Liege against the Belgian authorities\u2019 management of coronavirus.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yves Herman/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T13:32:36.324Z\">at 2.32pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe88bf8f08898ae689136b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T12:20:07.127Z\">1.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Denmark reports zero coronavirus-related deaths for the first time since March</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Denmark has reported zero coronavirus-related deaths in the last 24 hours for the first time since 13 March, Reuters reports.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T13:33:01.701Z\">at 2.33pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe87d98f08898ae6891364\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/david-agren\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T12:15:50.238Z\">1.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>More than 100 Mexicans have died from drinking adulterated alcohol over the past month in a string of mass poisonings which followed a ban on the sale of liquor during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> \n  <p>Deaths from unsafe alcohol have been reported in at least four states.

Whether there is a maximum number of people allowed for each household has not been specified. For those from a single household the distancing rules do not apply. </p> \n  <p>Waiting staff are required to wear face coverings.

If restaurants submit applications specific to the streets they would like to occupy, officials will move to close the roads to traffic on Fridays and at weekends, between 11am and 10pm.</p> \n  <p>Some concerns have been expressed that that arrangement may put the safety of diners under threat \u2013 with some sceptics making reference to the Berlin Christmas market attack of 2016 when an Islamist terrorist drove a lorry into the crowd, killing 12.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T11:13:13.631Z\">at 12.13pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe70258f08898ae689124f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T10:36:25.650Z\">11.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>I\u2019m Aamna Mohdin, taking over the liveblog from my colleague Matt. </p> \n  <p>If you want to get in touch, you can email me (aamna.mohdin@theguardian.com) or reach me on Twitter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/aamnamohdin\">@aamnamohdin</a>).</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe6bb88f08898ae689122b\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T10:33:52.799Z\">11.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here\u2019s a roundup of the key developments so far on Friday: </p> \n  <p><strong>China marks one month with no new coronavirus deaths announced</strong><br></p> \n  <p>China has gone a month without announcing any new deaths from the coronavirus. The National Health Commission reported four new cases of the virus on Friday, all local cross-infections in the north-eastern province of Jilin where a cluster of uncertain origin has been detected in recent days. The last time the commission reported a death was on 14 April.</p> \n  <p><strong>Virus pushes Germany into recession</strong><br></p> \n  <p>German output shrank by 2.2% in the first quarter of 2020, according to new official data. The quarter-on-quarter contraction is \u201cthe worst since the financial crisis\u201d in 2009, the federal statistics office Destatis said. The agency also revised its gross domestic product (GDP) figure for the final quarter of 2019 from zero growth to a contraction of 0.1%, meaning Germany has now experienced two consecutive quarters of contraction \u2013 the technical definition of a recession.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Slovenia proclaims end to the outbreak</strong></p> \n  <p>Slovenia has become the first European country to proclaim an end to the coronavirus epidemic at home. It said on Friday that the spread of Covid-19 was under control and there was no longer a need for extraordinary health measures.</p> \n  <p><strong>Spain announces lowest daily death toll since Monday</strong></p> \n  <p>Spain\u2019s death toll from coronavirus registered its lowest increase since Monday with 138 new fatalities announced by the health ministry. The overall coronavirus death toll, in Europe\u2019s fourth worst hit country, rose to 27,459 on Friday, while the number of diagnosed cases rose to 230,183 cases from 229,540.</p> \n  <p><strong>Italy and Germany to ease more restrictions</strong></p> \n  <p>Italy is set to allow free travel across the country from 3 June, according to a draft decree seen by Reuters. The draft, which could still be modified before it is approved, also said all travel within separate Italian regions would be allowed from 18 May. Germany will loosen quarantine rules for travellers arriving from the European Union and the UK, according to the interior ministry. </p> \n  <p><strong>China responds diplomatically to Trump threat of cutting off ties</strong></p> \n  <p>China\u2019s foreign ministry has responded diplomatically to Donald Trump\u2019s threat of cutting ties with Beijing over the virus. The US president said the pandemic had cast a pall over his January trade deal with Beijing and that he had no interest in speaking to President Xi Jinping at the moment. China\u2019s foreign ministry said on Friday that steady Sino-US bilateral relations served the interests of both countries.</p> \n  <p><strong>Baltic states restore free movement </strong></p> \n  <p>The Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have opened their borders to each other to create a mini-Schengen area. Free movement of people will be restored to all 6 million permanent residents of the Baltic states, but arrivals from outside the three countries will have to undergo a two-week quarantine period.</p> \n  <p><strong>Mexico sees record one-day increase in cases</strong></p> \n  <p> Mexico\u2019s health ministry on Thursday confirmed 257 additional coronavirus deaths and 2,409 new infections, the biggest one-day rise in cases since the pandemic began.The new infections brought confirmed coronavirus cases to 42,595 and 4,477 deaths in total, according to the official tally.</p> \n  <p><strong>Brazil confirmed cases pass 200,000</strong></p> \n  <p>The number of cases in Brazil passed 200,000 on Thursday. The country now has 202,918 confirmed cases, with 13,944 added in the last 24 hours, according to health ministry.The tally means it is the sixth-worst-affected country worldwide in terms of cases, according to Johns Hopkins data. 844 new deaths were reported in last 24 hours, bringing the total to 13,993.</p> \n  <p><strong>South Korea, China and Japan\u2019s health ministers to hold video conference</strong></p> \n  <p>The health ministers of South Korea, China and Japan will get together by video conference on Friday to discuss ways to work together in the global campaign against the coronavirus, South Korean officials said. The meeting is the first between top health officials of the east Asian neighbours since the outbreak emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.</p> \n  <p><strong>Covid-19 reaches refugee camps in Bangladesh</strong></p> \n  <p>Aid groups have warned of a looming humanitarian disaster after coronavirus was detected for the first time in the sprawling camps that host about 1 million Rohingya refugees.

This is a \u201creciprocal\u201d measure after Spain imposed 14 days\u2019 quarantine for anyone arriving from the EU/Schengen area.</p> \n  <p> The French border is currently closed to any visitors other than essential travellers who have a \u201ccompelling\u201d professional or personal reason to enter the country and are carrying a sworn declaration to that effect. June 15 has been set for a possible reopening of French borders to European visitors.</p> \n  <p>Deaths on French roads dropped by just under 56% during April compared with the same month last year. This is hardly surprising as everyone was locked down, but police records suggested those who were on the empty roads drove faster.

According to data collected by Johns Hopkins University, at least 302,452 people have now died as a result of the outbreak. The institution says it has counted 4,443,597 confirmed cases worldwide. It\u2019s important to point out that the actual death toll is believed to be far higher than the tally compiled from government figures.</li> \n   <li><strong>China marks one month with no new coronavirus deaths announced. </strong>China has gone a month without announcing any new deaths from the coronavirus. The National Health Commission reported four new cases of the virus on Friday, all local cross-infections in the northeastern province of Jilin where a cluster of uncertain origin has been detected in recent days. The last time the commission reported a death was on 14 April.</li> \n   <li><strong>Trump threatens to cut China ties. </strong>US President Donald Trump signalled a further deterioration of his relationship with China over coronavirus, saying he has no interest in speaking to President Xi Jinping at the moment and going so far as to suggest he could cut ties with the world\u2019s second largest economy. Chinese state media has responded saying his comments are \u201clunacy\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>Trump visits a mask distribution centre without wearing a mask himself. </strong>Donald Trump toured a mask distribution centre in the political swing state of Pennsylvania on Thursday but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/donald-trump-mask-medical-equipment-facility-pennsylvania\">without wearing a mask himself</a>. Trump, who is running for re-election in November, has resisted wearing a mask in public despite his administration\u2019s guidance to Americans to wear them and new White House rules requiring staff to wear them at work.</li> \n   <li><strong>Mexico sees record one-day increase in cases. </strong>Mexico\u2019s health ministry on Thursday confirmed 257 additional coronavirus deaths and 2,409 new infections, the biggest one-day rise in cases since the pandemic began.The new infections brought confirmed coronavirus cases to 42,595 and 4,477 deaths in total, according to the official tally.</li> \n   <li><strong>Brazil confirmed cases pass 200,000. </strong>The number of cases in Brazil passed 200,000 on Thursday.The country now has 202,918 confirmed cases, with 13,944 added in last 24 hours, according to health ministry.The tally means it is the sixth-worst-affected country worldwide in terms of cases, according to Johns Hopkins data. 844 new deaths were reported in last 24 hours, bringing the total to 13,993.</li> \n   <li><strong>South Korea, China and Japan health ministers to hold video conference. </strong>The health ministers of South Korea, China and Japan will get together by video conference on Friday to discuss ways to work together in the global campaign against the novel coronavirus, South Korean officials said. The meeting is the first between top health officials of the East Asian neighbours since the outbreak emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.</li> \n   <li><strong>Doctors in Italy and France report spike in rare inflammatory syndrome linked to coronavirus. </strong>Doctors in northern Italy,<strong> </strong>one of the areas hardest hit by coronavirus, and in France have reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/13/italian-doctors-find-link-between-covid-19-and-inflammatory-disorder\">spikes in cases of a rare inflammatory</a> syndrome in young children that appears similar to one reported in the US, Britain and Spain, according to a report in the Lancet.The condition shares symptoms with toxic shock and Kawasaki disease including fever, rashes, swollen glands and, in severe cases, heart inflammation.</li> \n   <li><strong>Covid-19 reaches refugee camps in Bangladesh. </strong>A Rohingya man has become the first person to test positive for Covid-19 in the vast refugee camps in Bangladesh that is home to almost one million people. Local health coordinator Abu Toha Bhuiyan initially said two refugees had been put into isolation. The World Health Organization later said one case was of a Rohingya man, and the other was of a local man who lived near the camp and was being treated at a clinic inside the area.</li> \n   <li><strong>36 million Americans are now unemployed. </strong>Another 3 million Americans filed for benefits, bringing the country\u2019s total unemployed to 36 million. The latest figures from the Department of Labor show the rate of claims is slowing but the record-breaking pace of layoffs has already pushed unemployment to levels unseen since the Great Depression of the 1930s.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/coronavirus-latest-at-a-glance\">Coronavirus latest: at a glance</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T07:05:58.460Z\">at 8.05am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe2d908f08d99d46a174b0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T05:50:18.490Z\">6.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Get in touch on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan\">Twitter @helenrsullivan</a>. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe2c038f08d99d46a174a3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/alison-rourke\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T05:45:17.107Z\">6.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <h2>Global report: Trump threat to cut trade ties over Covid-19 branded \u2018lunacy\u2019 by Chinese media</h2> \n  <p>An escalation of rhetoric between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> and China over the coronavirus pandemic has sparked concerns that a trade deal between the nations is in peril, as Chinese state media dismissed as \u201clunacy\u201d a suggestion by the US president that he could \u201ccut off relations with Beijing.</p> \n  <p>The US president said he was very disappointed with China\u2019s failure to contain Covid-19 in an interview with Fox Business news.

According to data collected by Johns Hopkins University, at least 302,452 people have now died as a result of the outbreak.The institution says it has counted 4,443,597 confirmed cases worldwide. It\u2019s important to point out that the actual death toll is believed to be far higher than the tally compiled from government figures.</li> \n   <li><strong>China marks one month with no new coronavirus deaths announced. </strong>China has gone a month without announcing any new deaths from the coronavirus. The National Health Commission reported four new cases of the virus Friday, all local cross-infections in the northeastern province of Jilin where a cluster of uncertain origin has been detected in recent days. The last time the commission reported a death was on 14 April.</li> \n   <li><strong>Trump says he could cut China ties. </strong>US President Donald Trump signalled a further deterioration of his relationship with China over the novel coronavirus, saying he has no interest in speaking to President Xi Jinping right now and going so far as to suggest he could even cut ties with the world\u2019s second largest economy. </li> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/donald-trump-mask-medical-equipment-facility-pennsylvania\">Donald Trump visits a mask distribution centre without wearing a mask himself</a>. </strong>Donald Trump toured a mask distribution centre in the political swing state of Pennsylvania on Thursday but without wearing a mask himself.Trump, who is running for re-election in November, has resisted wearing a mask in public despite his administration\u2019s guidance to Americans to wear them and new White House rules requiring staff to wear them at work.</li> \n   <li><strong>The health ministers of South Korea, China and Japan will gather by video conference </strong>to discuss ways to work together in the global campaign against the novel coronavirus, South Korean officials said. The meeting is the first between top health officials of the East Asian neighbours since the outbreak emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Mexico sees record one-day increase in cases. </strong>Mexico\u2019s health ministry on Thursday confirmed 257 additional coronavirus deaths and 2,409 new infections, the biggest one-day rise in cases since the pandemic began.The new infections brought confirmed coronavirus cases to 42,595 and 4,477 deaths in total, according to the official tally.</li> \n   <li><strong>Brazil confirmed cases pass 200,000. </strong>The number of cases in Brazil passed 200,000 on Thursday.The country now has 202,918 confirmed cases, with 13,944 added in last 24 hours, according to health ministry.The tally means it is the sixth-worst-affected country worldwide in terms of cases, according to Johns Hopkins data. 844 new deaths were reported in last 24 hours, bringing the total to 13,993.</li> \n   <li><strong>Doctors in Italy and France report spike in rare inflammatory syndrome linked to coronavirus. </strong>Doctors in northern Italy,<strong> </strong>one of the areas hardest hit by coronavirus, and in France have reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/13/italian-doctors-find-link-between-covid-19-and-inflammatory-disorder\">spikes in cases of a rare inflammatory</a> syndrome in young children that appears similar to one reported in the US, Britain and Spain, according to a report in the Lancet.The condition shares symptoms with toxic shock and Kawasaki disease including fever, rashes, swollen glands and, in severe cases, heart inflammation.</li> \n   <li><strong>A vaccine for coronavirus must be available to all countries, the EU has insisted</strong>, after the British chief executive of French drugs company Sanofi said it was reserving the first shipments of its vaccine for the US. \u201cThe vaccine against Covid-19 should be a global public good and its access needs to be equitable and universal,\u201d said the European commission spokesman, Stefan de Keersmaecker.</li> \n   <li><strong>36 million Americans are now unemployed as another 3 million filed for benefits</strong>. The latest figures from the Department of Labor show the rate of claims is slowing but the record-breaking pace of layoffs has already pushed unemployment to levels unseen since the Great Depression of the 1930s.</li> \n   <li><strong>The European commission has suspended the delivery of 10 million face masks from China</strong> after two countries complained about the poor quality of the batches they received, the Associated Press reports. As part of its efforts to tackle the Covid-19 crisis, this month the commission started dispatching the masks to healthcare workers in its 27 member states and the UK.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T07:07:10.737Z\">at 8.07am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe1d1b8f080c727453b50c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T04:41:08.002Z\">5.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Get in touch on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan\">Twitter @helenrsullivan</a>. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe1c578f080c727453b508\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T04:37:51.856Z\">5.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/kjalee/status/1260918708458991616\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Oh my god, this is amazing.

The true number is likely to be higher. </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Global death toll passes 300,000. </strong>The global toll from Covid-19 has just passed 300,000, with nearly 4.5 million people infected.According to data collected by Johns Hopkins University, at least 301,370 people have now died as a result of the outbreak.The institution says it has counted 4,426,937 confirmed cases worldwide. It\u2019s important to point out that the actual death toll is believed to be far higher than the tally compiled from government figures.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Nearly 600,000 Australians have lost their jobs during the pandemic. </strong>Almost 600,000 Australians lost their jobs between March and April, unemployment rose to 6.2%, the underemployment rate increased by 4.9 points to 13.7% and the underutilisation rate increased by 5.9 points to 19.9%.The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the figures were \u201cterribly shocking, although not totally unexpected\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>Doctors in Italy and France report spike in rare inflammatory syndrome linked to coronavirus. </strong>Doctors in northern Italy,<strong> </strong>one of the areas hardest hit by coronavirus, and in France have reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/13/italian-doctors-find-link-between-covid-19-and-inflammatory-disorder\">spikes in cases of a rare inflammatory</a> syndrome in young children that appears similar to one reported in the US, Britain and Spain, according to a report in the Lancet.The condition shares symptoms with toxic shock and Kawasaki disease including fever, rashes, swollen glands and, in severe cases, heart inflammation.</li> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/donald-trump-mask-medical-equipment-facility-pennsylvania\">Donald Trump visits a mask distribution centre without wearing a mask himself</a>. </strong>Donald Trump toured a mask distribution centre in the political swing state of Pennsylvania on Thursday but without wearing a mask himself.Trump, who is running for re-election in November, has resisted wearing a mask in public despite his administration\u2019s guidance to Americans to wear them and new White House rules requiring staff to wear them at work.</li> \n   <li><strong>A vaccine for coronavirus must be available to all countries, the EU has insisted</strong>, after the British chief executive of French drugs company Sanofi said it was reserving the first shipments of its vaccine for the US. \u201cThe vaccine against Covid-19 should be a global public good and its access needs to be equitable and universal,\u201d said the European commission spokesman, Stefan de Keersmaecker.</li> \n   <li><strong>36 million Americans are now unemployed as another 3 million filed for benefits</strong>. The latest figures from the Department of Labor show the rate of claims is slowing but the record-breaking pace of layoffs has already pushed unemployment to levels unseen since the Great Depression of the 1930s.</li> \n   <li><strong>The European commission has suspended the delivery of 10 million face masks from China</strong> after two countries complained about the poor quality of the batches they received, the Associated Press reports. As part of its efforts to tackle the Covid-19 crisis, this month the commission started dispatching the masks to healthcare workers in its 27 member states and the UK.</li> \n   <li><strong>Officials in Bangladesh have announced the first confirmed case of coronavirus in the country\u2019s Rohingya refugee camps</strong>. Health experts and NGOs have issued warnings that the virus could race through the camps that house almost a million people forced to flee a military offensive in Myanmar almost two years ago.</li> \n   <li><strong>Greece will open 515 organised beaches to the public this weekend</strong>, but alcohol and music will be banned, along with sports and games. Scientists advising the government also insisted that given the dictates of social distancing there can only be 40 people per 1000 sq meters.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Governments, health authorities and civil society groups should urgently address mental health problems sparked by the coronavirus pandemic</strong>, the UN secretary general has said.

Twenty years after release it has lost none of its emotional sting.</p> <p>Adapted from Melina Marchetta\u2019s beloved, best-selling 1992 novel, the film follows the stubborn and smart-mouthed Josie Alibrandi (Pia Miranda) in her final year of high school. She navigates a jagged relationship with her matriarchal Italian family, including mother (Greta Scacchi) and grandmother (Elena Cotta), confronts xenophobia and class anxiety at her private Catholic school, develops a relationship with her out-of-the-picture father (Anthony LaPaglia), dates, studies and wrestles with her own in-flux identity.</p> <p>Growing up with Italian grandparents and attending a vicious Catholic Sydney high school, I clung to the book (and later film) because it held a mirror to my upbringing, previously unseen in pop culture. Beyond those specific similarities, it also understood that the experience of teenage girlhood is plagued by cruelty, cluelessness and soul-crushing indignities.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmVz-L1Eeg4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wmVz-L1Eeg4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The film\u2019s thoughtful and yet unvarnished depiction of teen suicide remains especially resonant. The death of Josie\u2019s friend and crush, John Barton (Matthew Newton) \u2013 burdened by the expectations of his powerful, political family \u2013 is a moment glued to the subconscious of many Australians of a particular age. It\u2019s difficult to watch the film\u2019s sombre and restrained funeral scene without sobbing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/20/how-the-chaser-invaded-apec-a-small-camera-was-secreted-behind-his-scrotum\">How The Chaser invaded Apec: 'A small video tape was secreted behind his scrotum'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Written, directed and produced by three women on their first feature film, Looking for Alibrandi was a critical and commercial hit, winning best film at the Australian Film Institute awards in 2000.</p> <p>For the film\u2019s 20th anniversary this month, I spoke to Marchetta, director Kate Woods, producer Robyn Kershaw and Miranda about how the film was made, its enduring legacy and that heart-wrenching funeral scene.</p> <h2>\u2018This was the most-stolen book out of any school library<strong>\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Kershaw:</strong> [Film producer] Tristram Miall said to me: \u201cWould you like to read this book? I can\u2019t seem to get the development happening on it.\u201d I read it in one night and came in the next day, and said: \u201cI love this. I cried. It was fantastic \u2026 [but] I\u2019d only be interested if Melina was interested.\u201d So he spoke to Melina, we all met, and then Melina and I started working on drafting the screenplay.</p> <p><strong>Marchetta:</strong> I wasn\u2019t interested in rushing into anything, because I felt that no one had really written about the cultural experience of Italians in a positive way, and I was very nervous about what they would do with it. But Tristram had just done Strictly Ballroom, which I did love. We had a few offshore offers, but a couple of months later I decided nup, I\u2019ll go with Tristram ...</p> <p>I think they were just finding it hard to find the right person to write the script. Anyone who tried, you know, there was a bit of cultural insensitivity to the work. So when he brought Robyn Kershaw [on] as the producer, that for me started really shaping everything.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f33b3756288cf832ed971cc4910f3bff2b79568e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f33b3756288cf832ed971cc4910f3bff2b79568e/0_0_1181_708/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pia Miranda as Josie and Kick Gurry as love interest, Jacob (right).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"599\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pia Miranda as Josie and Kick Gurry as love interest, Jacob (right).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roadshow Entertainment</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Kershaw:</strong> I met with pretty much every single female director at the time. I think I knew that it needed to be someone who was coming of age, like I was. It was a coming-of-age experience for me as a film-maker, and for the director and for Melina as a screenwriter.</p> <p><strong>Woods:</strong> We worked together for three years before it came out. I was very mindful that this was the most-stolen book out of any school library. That was a dubious honour. This was a really well-known book and a much-loved character. If we didn\u2019t get it right, we\u2019d be crucified.</p> <p>We put ads in the Italian and Serbian newspapers, we ran ads on Triple J, we wrote to the drama clubs of schools. We wanted to open up [the role] to where these characters could actually come from, rather than going to the names of teenage actors and actresses that had done the work before. We wanted it to be authentic.</p> <p><strong>Kershaw: </strong>We auditioned more than 3,000 people.</p> <p><strong>Miranda (Alibrandi):</strong> I had to fly myself up to do a cattle call audition \u2026 It was almost like a dance audition. They read out the names of the people they wanted to stay after every section.</p> <p>A couple of years before I\u2019d suffered the trauma of losing a friend, and I think I could access those emotions of anger and fear when I had to improv those scenes about John\u2019s death.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"03ac522dc4b703c3ab95306c8c311f403c4a9067\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03ac522dc4b703c3ab95306c8c311f403c4a9067/0_95_1131_1413/800.jpg\" alt=\"Australian actor Pia Miranda, who got her breakout role in Looking for Alibrandi.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Australian actor Pia Miranda, who got her breakout role in Looking for Alibrandi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Woods</strong>: The way [Miranda] took on that role was pretty amazing. She really had an enormous amount of stamina and understanding of the character and heart and passion for it. She just did a beautiful job.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018There weren\u2019t that many Australian movies that dealt with suicide\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Marchetta</strong>: John Barton\u2019s death in the novel is at the end, and people who were reading the film script were saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t want a death like that dominating the climax of the story. Why don\u2019t you take it out?\u201d And I remember thinking: \u201cOh I can\u2019t take this out.\u201d I distinctly remember that putting his death in the middle of the story would be a catalyst for change for [Josie].</p> <p>I was teaching while I was writing the script and when it was filmed, so I had the pleasure of my students being in a lot of the group scenes. Some of my students are the pallbearers in the funeral scene.</p> <p><strong>Miranda:</strong> I find it really, really hard to watch people be pallbearers when they carry someone they love or care about. So for me, even though it wasn\u2019t real, I found that really confronting to watch.</p> <p><strong>Woods:</strong> That image of the boys from the school putting their friend on their shoulders was one of the first images I had about the film. I always knew that that was really important, because I could not imagine what it would be like to carry your friend under those circumstances.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There was nothing perfect about Josie. She was every woman. She was the outsider and we always feel like the outsider</p> <footer> <cite>Robyn Kershaw, producer</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It was just about getting the tone right \u2026 Obviously everybody\u2019s really upset, but also you didn\u2019t want it to be just totally morbid. I think that the music definitely helped with that.</p> <p>At one stage we wanted [Jeff Buckley\u2019s] Hallelujah. But it had already been in so many films.</p> <p><strong>Kershaw:</strong> Once we actually got that beautiful voice from Cordrazine\u2019s lead singer [Hamish Cowan, singing U2\u2019s With or Without You], there was just no turning back. It was just heartbreaking.</p> <p><strong>Woods:</strong> It lifted it into a different sphere. It felt more poignant to younger people than the original U2 version.</p> <p><strong>Miranda:</strong> It was a tough day, but a good day because I knew we nailed it and knew we\u2019d all taken it seriously. There weren\u2019t that many Australian movies where they dealt with suicide \u2013 certainly that I\u2019d seen \u2013 so it felt pretty important to do it right.</p> <p>I think the anger and confusion when someone kills themselves was conveyed really well in the film. It was also conveyed really well that life goes on after that person passes. it\u2019s sort of a message to say, if that person had survived maybe they would have gone on with their life in a happy way as well. It\u2019s sad to see their story end and everyone else\u2019s continue. That\u2019s what really gets people.</p> <p><strong>Kershaw: </strong>My daughter, who I was pregnant with in 1997 \u2013 we used to refer to her as our Alibrandi baby \u2013 she actually watched it and had no idea about [my involvement]. When she was about 11 or 12, she said to me: \u201cMum, I just can\u2019t believe I just watched this film. And I\u2019ve been trying to watch it for a long time but every time it gets to a particular part, I just have to stop and I can\u2019t keep going. This time, I managed to watch it all and it\u2019s my favourite film.\u201d I said: \u201cOh darling, what film was that?\u201d And she said Looking for Alibrandi. I said: \u201cSo which was the scene that always made you stop?\u201d and it was the funeral scene.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d986a0682cbea9066765f94bcd0a19d6029a6ba4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d986a0682cbea9066765f94bcd0a19d6029a6ba4/0_0_2896_1895/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Greta Scacchi, Elena Cotta, and Pia Miranda as the three generations of Alibrandi women.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"654\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greta Scacchi, Elena Cotta, and Pia Miranda as the three generations of Alibrandi women.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beyond/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018Everybody laughed and cried and was quiet in all the right places\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Miranda:</strong> We were just so proud of it; we\u2019d all just worked so hard. We were excited too because it was Kate and my first big film and we went through it together. Kate always had this thing like: \u201cI want to go see it with an audience and see what their reaction is, like where they are laughing, where they are crying.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Woods: </strong>I said: \u201cYou know, it\u2019s an Australian film. It will be off in a week.\u201d I took Pia because she hadn\u2019t really seen it in the theatre before.</p> <p>We went to the local cinema at Broadway, near Sydney University. And we could barely get a seat \u2013 we had to sit right down the front. Pia was trying to hide because a couple of people had started to recognise her by then. She was watching and [her face] was too big and too close to her, and I was kind of watching what was happening behind [us], when everybody laughed and cried and was quiet in all the right places \u2026</p> <p>I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had an experience like that ever again in my life. It actually touched people in the way the story touched us \u2026 I\u2019ll never forget it, ever.</p> <p><strong>Marchetta</strong>: So much love went into that production, and I think it shows. There\u2019s just something about it that still has that charm and has that passion. I could look at it and I could point out all the flaws of course, but it\u2019s a piece of work that I\u2019m so incredibly proud of being a part of, because I was <em>part </em>of it \u2013 I wasn\u2019t the whole.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018It was a new thing to see migrant stories in film told beautifully\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Woods:</strong> It touches everybody. I recognise my own youth in it. We all have that up and down, you know. It\u2019s wonderful, it\u2019s terrible. There\u2019s no middle ground when you\u2019re 16.</p> <p><strong>Kershaw:</strong> There was nothing perfect about Josie. She was every woman. She was the outsider, and we all always feel like the outsider.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/04/it-was-insane-callan-mulvey-on-being-drazic-the-heartthrob-of-heartbreak-high\">'It was insane': Callan Mulvey on being Drazic, the heartthrob of Heartbreak High</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Miranda</strong>: It was a new thing to see migrant stories in film told really beautifully and where they weren\u2019t the kind of quirky, annoying sidekick.</p> <p><strong>Marchetta</strong>: I certainly believe that there is not enough cultural diversity in our films. I\u2019ve said so many times that my greatest pride was that Josie Alibrandi was the first teenage character of Australian film in the 21st century.

  "<p>A story of man\u2019s self-destructive impulse to conquer nature and about American exceptionalism, with detours through Napoleonic France and the end of the Irish rebellion in 1801 \u2026 narrated by a 13,000-year-old fossilised mammoth?</p> <p>My doubts were as heavy as those ancient bones of <em>Mammut americanum</em>, going by the name \u201cMammut\u201d, on the eve of his auction in New York in 2007, along with the remains of a Tyrannosaurus bataar, \u201cT. bat\u201d, a prehistoric penguin, \u201cPaleo\u201d, a pterodactyl, \u201cPeterodactyl antiquus\u201d, and the hand of an Egyptian mummy belonging to Pharaoh Hatshepsut, \u201cHattie\u201d.</p> <p>That\u2019s the opening cast and improbable set-up of Chris Flynn\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.uqp.com.au/books/mammoth\">new novel Mammoth</a>, drawn from an event where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/22/nicolas-cage-returns-stolen-mongolian-dinosaur-skull-he-bought-at-gallery\">powerful American men including actors Nicolas Cage and Leonardo DiCaprio bid for the skull of T. bat and other extinct animals</a>.

They were truly stupid. They had at their feet all the materials required for the construction of shelters, and yet it never occurred to them to erect a wikiup. Instead, they fought with bears and lions for prime cave real estate. They hunted <em>Mammut </em>too, in their own pathetic way. Their spears were laughable sharpened sticks that bounced off our hides. Their sense of self-preservation was not very evolved. They would rut out in the open, exposing themselves to attack. My grandfather told me he saw a couple torn apart by a pack of <em>Smilodon </em>who snuck up on the humans while they were copulating in a woodland glade. Talk about <em>coitus interruptus</em>. We figured if these were the best hairless bipeds nature could throw at us, we would be lords of the steppe for the next million years. Then Clovis turned up. Their numbers were few at first, but we knew immediately they would be trouble. These bipeds were dressed head to toe in animal skins, carefully sewn together with bone needles. It was my introduction to the oddly intertwined human notions of pride and style. Fur was in that season, as it was to be every season thereafter.\u201d</p> <p>There follows the (living) biography of Mammut, to the point of his extinction, a long type of suspended consciousness, and his rebirth as the observer of and traveller with modern homo sapiens beginning about 220 years ago after being dug up on a farm in Orange County, New York.</p> <p>It is an ambitious, hilarious, disarmingly poignant and clever beast of a novel that had me disappearing down internet burrows about meteor strikes, the American presidential penchant for big pets, the life of Hatshepsut and key figures in the 1801 rebellion.</p> <p>The book was seeded for Irish-Australian Flynn about 10 years ago with the public release of a tranche of the letters of the third president of the United States, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/thomas-jefferson/\">Thomas Jefferson</a>. Jefferson wanted the world \u2013 which is to say, mainly Europe \u2013 to understand that his new republic was imposed on a vast land as steeped in the past, as storied with the roaming of great beasts, as anywhere in the old world.</p> <p>Jefferson wrote of wanting a set of mammoth bones \u2013 if not an actual living one \u2013 to demonstrate this to the world.</p> <p>\u201cI thought it was a pretty weird thing for an incumbent president to be fascinated with \u2026 In his first year in office he was accused of spending way too much time in the White House trying to assemble his skeletons rather than concentrating on policy. So that had stuck in my mind \u2013 how strange that he was asking people to go out and find him mammoth bones or even a live specimen \u2026 So that was the beginning of it for me.\u201d</p> <p>Jefferson\u2019s monomania connotes an expansive, enduring American exceptionalism, a preoccupation with Greatness across the centuries of the next 40 of the presidents up to George Bush Jr that Mammut observed. It is all pre-Trump. But it resonates with his political bombast, with that \u201cgreat\u201d America Trump invokes he\u2019s rebuilding but which actually teeters on failed statehood \u2013 the extinction, just like <em>Mammut americanum</em>, of the dream.</p> <p>\u201cI heard about the [2007] auction where you had Cage and DiCaprio fighting over a tyrannosaurus skull and a mammoth was on sale too. That struck a chord with me because I realised that 200 years later the mammoth was still a commodity \u2013 these creatures are still being bought and sold and fought over by men in power essentially to be used as symbols to show how strong and macho they are and how great America is \u2026 So I realised there was a bit of a story jumping between those two time periods and it took me a little while to work out how to tell it.\u201d</p> <p>What might sound like a challenging melange of disjointed events from deep time and recent history is seamless, thanks to Flynn\u2019s confident, great-arc-of-history narrative, his intimacy with subject, the deceptive authenticity of mammoth\u2019s voice and the personalities he attributes to the others (wait for Paleo\u2019s descriptions of the penguin\u2019s erotic life!). If a novel reads like it was hard to write, it probably was. Mammoth reads easily. It\u2019s a joy. A rolling journey. But Flynn indicates his third novel was neither quick nor easy to create.</p> <p>From that germ of an idea a decade ago, he went at it from a few different angles.</p> <p>\u201cI tried to tell the story from the point of view of hardy pioneer who had been hired by Jefferson to go out and search the wilds of Kentucky for mammoth bones. It was very <a href=\"https://www.cormacmccarthy.com/\">Cormac McCarthy</a>-esque and pretty grim and it sort of ran out of steam pretty quick. I didn\u2019t really know where to go with it and I just couldn\u2019t work it out for years \u2026 I was working at the RSPCA for the last five years, looking after sick and injured kittens and getting this sense of the internal life of animals quite a lot. And that\u2019s when I thought: \u2018Aha! Maybe animals should tell the story.\u2019 That was my way into it. From that point on it was just enormous fun.\u201d</p> <p>There are all sorts of musings on the idiocy of the modern hominid, most relating to the desecration of nature. But the theft of (sentient, as it transpires) mammoth bones makes for journeys through Napoleonic France, the farcical last days of the Irish rebellion and a more dangerous and fateful (for the hominids) journey through midwest America.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/24/lions-tigers-and-bears-the-us-presidents-who-took-animal-ownership-to-extremes\">Lions, tigers and bears: the US presidents who took animal ownership to extremes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The musings don\u2019t relate only to Americans.

Cooking and eating dinner together as a family was virtually an anomaly.</p> <p>On a health level, I\u2019ve eaten better than I have in years, and that\u2019s saying a lot. We tend to cook more healthfully for ourselves and our family, perhaps after the initial period of comforting eating, I\u2019ve noticed a trend sliding back to more wholefood conscientiousness.</p> <p>Already I have spoken to three prominent chefs who have vowed to maintain their home cooking regularly. Chef David Thompson, perhaps one of the busiest jet-setting chefs and restaurateurs I know, has relished this enforced stay-at-home period. He has masterminded and refined his readymade curry paste line, which will soon be available for purchase to home cooks worldwide. The entire range from massaman to green curry paste sounds absolutely divine. These will give everybody a leg up on producing restaurant-quality curries at home. But for now, while we have the time still, pull out your mortar and pestle.</p> <p>Homemade curry paste is much easier than you think. It can be used in lots of different dishes, cooked with a variety of methods.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/may/09/lard-di-dah-how-to-render-animal-fats\">Lard-di-dah: how to render animal fats</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For example, you can quickly make an excellent stir fry using lard to cook out the curry paste, add a bit of protein, mushroom or eggplants and some aromatics such as Thai basil and freshly torn Makrut lime leaves and minimal seasoning such as fish sauce, oyster sauce \u2013 voil\u00e0, you have a wonderful dinner within 10 minutes. It can be portioned, frozen and later reconstituted to make a 20-minute curry with coconut cream and fresh ingredients for when you are again time poor.</p> <p>Making curry paste from scratch will not only yield a freshly aromatic result, you will also get sense of having had a workout-meditative session at the same time. Pound that baby for a good while. It takes longer than you think to get it to paste consistency.</p> <p>I hear you ask, why can\u2019t I use a blender? Well you can, but it just won\u2019t be as delightful \u2013 a blender will cut and shred the ingredients up finely, but when you pound it together it ruptures more cells to release the aromatics completely. By pounding you end up with less oxidated paste, that will keep longer and cook up better.</p> <p>Besides, I have found that pounding away with the mortar and pestle is an excellent way of exorcising the frustration of not having access to dine-in premium sushi.</p> <h2>Red curry paste</h2> <p><strong>10 dry long red chillies,</strong> soaked in water for 20 minutes, roughly chopped<strong><br>5 red birds eye chillies</strong>, coarsely chopped<strong><br>1 tsp salt<br>1 tbs fresh galangal</strong>, coarsely chopped<strong><br>2 stalks of lemongrass</strong>, white hearts only, cut into 1cm pieces<strong><br>3 red shallots</strong>, peeled and roughly chopped<strong><br>10-15 cloves of garlic</strong>, depending on the size<strong><br>1 tbs shrimp paste<br>2 coriander roots</strong>, chopped roughly<strong><br>10 whole white peppers</strong>, freshly toasted<strong><br>1 Makrut lime rind</strong>, finely chopped (you can also use a zester to grate)<strong><br>1 tsp cumin</strong>, freshly toasted and ground<strong><br>1 tsp coriander seeds</strong>, freshly toasted and ground</p> <p>In order of pliability \u2013 from hardest to softest \u2013 pound the ingredients using a mortar and pestle and long handled spoon.

Make sure they are combined before adding the next ingredient. Do this with everything except the shrimp paste, then pound until smooth, scraping down the contents with the spoon as you go.</p> <p>Lastly add the shrimp paste and pound until it all looks like one pliable paste, then refrigerate to rest. After it has chilled, batch it up into portions and freeze what you won\u2019t use quickly \u2013 putting your paste into a large holed ice cube tray is a great hack.</p>",

An R value above 1 means the epidemic will start to grow exponentially again, which would result in a new surge of cases.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e60c6aea-b500-4a5a-b6af-b1d99f7d0511\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n    <div>\n     <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n      <p></p>\n      <p>R, or the 'effective reproduction number', is a way of rating a disease\u2019s ability to spread. It\u2019s the average number of people on to whom one infected person will pass the virus. For an R of anything above 1, an epidemic will grow exponentially. Anything below 1 and an outbreak will fizzle out \u2013 eventually.</p>\n      <p>At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the estimated R for coronavirus was between 2 and 3 \u2013 higher than the value for seasonal flu, but lower than for measles. That means each person would pass it on to between two and three people on average, before either recovering or dying, and each of those people would pass it on to a further two to three others, causing the total number of cases to snowball over time.</p>\n      <p>The reproduction number is not fixed, though. It depends on the biology of the virus; people's behaviour, such as social distancing;&nbsp;and a population\u2019s immunity.

Lockdown restrictions have less impact in these settings and there are still concerns about the levels of testing available in care homes.</p> \n  <p>The figure suggests that, while the lockdown has been extremely effective at bringing down case numbers, R is still close to 1, meaning that it would not be possible to ease restrictions significantly without new measures to contain outbreaks, such as extensive testing and tracing.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T15:57:15.171Z\">at 4.57pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebeb3148f0849a584fe145a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T15:23:53.499Z\">4.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>People wrongly charged under coronavirus laws have included a teenager fined after going to visit his mother and a woman arrested at a train station.</p> \n  <p>Marie Dinou, 41, was held by British Transport Police at Newcastle Central station just days after the Coronavirus Act came into force and wrongly fined \u00a3660.</p> \n  <p>Her case was an early warning that the legislation \u2013 which allows officers to remove or detain a \u201csuspected infectious person\u201d for screening and assessment \u2013 was being misused by police.</p> \n  <p>The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has now admitted all 44 charges under the act, from when it was introduced on 27 March to the end of April, were wrong, following a review launched after errors were highlighted by journalists, lawyers and campaigners.</p> \n  <p>Thirty-one of the wrongful charges were corrected in court, but included 13 convictions, which have since been sent back to be withdrawn.</p> \n  <p>Lewis Brown, 18, was fined for allegedly breaching lockdown rules after going to visit his mother.

  "<p> </p> <p>A British cannabis producer has been acquired by a US-based private equity fund in a multimillion pound deal which some say could accelerate the legalisation of the recreational drug in the UK.</p> <p>Bridge Farm, a horticulture company based in Lincolnshire, has been acquired by Artemis Growth Partners for about $81m (\u00a366m). The fund\u2019s partners, many of whom are former Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan executives, has a large portfolio of companies that sell and advocate the use of cannabis for a number of different purposes including for medicinal use.</p> <p>Announcing the deal, Artemis said it expected the huge financial pressures on governments around the world after the coronavirus pandemic could see cannabis legalised to make it taxable.</p> <p>Steve Rolles, senior policy analyst at Transform, a charity that advocates for drugs policy reform, said such acquisitions may reveal shifting dynamics in the medical cannabis market, but tell us less about the wider legalisation debate.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK may be ahead of the game on medical cannabis production but we are way behind on actually making medical cannabis available. And unlike the UK, other countries like Canada, Uruguay, Mexico and Luxembourg are taking steps to legally regulate non-medical cannabis markets as well. Those reforms are changing the public debate globally, and helping shift opinion on wider legalisation in the UK too. The question is not if we should legalise, but how to do it properly\u201d he said.</p> <p>Despite the drug still being illegal in Britain, the farm has a government licence issued by the Home Office to produce and export cannabis to countries such as Canada where the drug is permitted. Only 12 such licences have been awarded.</p> <p>Louise Motala, managing director of Bridge Farm Group, said the impact of Covid-19 and Brexit on the industry resulted in an increased demand for high quality, sustainably grown products.</p> <p>She added: \u201cThis is an exciting time in Bridge Farm\u2019s history, over the last two years we have invested over \u00a345m in Clay Lake, one of the most advanced, environmentally sound cultivation facilities in Europe.</p> <p>\u201cWe have over 60 acres of fully automated, sustainable cultivation and production space and we are looking forward to realising the full potential of our scale and facilities for the benefit of our customers.\u201d</p> <p>The company, which also produces ornamental plants and herbs for supermarkets, has a 2m sq ft glasshouse facility in Spalding where it produces hemp for use in Cannabidiol (CBD) oil, commonly used to treat anxiety, and also stronger cannabis for other medicinal purposes.</p> <p>Will Muecke, co-founder of Artemis Growth Partners, told the Telegraph: \u201cIn the cannabis space, there is no equal asset to Bridge Farm. For us, this is incredibly opportunistic.\u201d</p> <p>The acquisition of the farm has offered the fund a unique opportunity, he said. \u201cThere really is no equal globally to the combination of team and asset at Bridge Farm.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to find budgets around countries to have giant gaps, and the economics are overwhelmingly in favour of governments jumping ahead and legalising cannabis and finding near-term revenue there.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Aid groups have warned of a looming humanitarian disaster after coronavirus was detected for the first time in the sprawling camps that host about one million Rohingya refugees.</p> <p>The camps in Cox\u2019s Bazar, Bangladesh, which are more densely populated than some of the world\u2019s busiest cities, have been under lockdown since 14 March in an attempt to stop the virus from spreading.</p> <p>As the number of coronavirus infections has continued to rise in Bangladesh, health experts and Rohingya community leaders have become increasingly concerned about possible outbreak among refugees. On Thursday, such fears were confirmed when the UN <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/first-coronavirus-case-rohingya-refugee-camps-bangladesh\">announced that an ethnic Rohingya refugee and another person had tested positive for Covid-19.</a> Humanitarian groups warn the virus could race through the camps, where families live with up to 10 people in a room in sweltering heat, with limited access to clean water. Households are forced to queue to access food at communal distribution points, making social distancing impossible.</p> <p>On top of overcrowding, many refugees, who fled persecution in Myanmar, have underlying health conditions or have not received standard immunisations, according to health experts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/first-coronavirus-case-rohingya-refugee-camps-bangladesh\">First coronavirus case at Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The charity M\u00e9dicins Sans Fronti\u00e8res warned that before Covid-19, around a third of patients it treated presented with respiratory tract symptoms, such as shortness of breath, meaning they are at higher risk of the disease. Health services for those who get sick is limited.</p> <p>Community members have volunteered to share information about the disease, but such awareness-raising activities have been hampered by an internet ban imposed on the camps. The blackout has made it harder for people to access reliable advice or news updates, and has fuelled a sense of panic among some.</p> <p>Mohammad Selim, 36, whose family of six live in the Kutupalong camp in Cox\u2019s Bazar, said people were very fearful. \u201cEveryone is talking about how there are one or two confirmed cases of in the camp. From what I\u2019ve heard about this disease, this is it, \u201d he said.</p> <p>NGOs have been sharing health guidance, he added, but he worries that the virus will spread easily as people move within or between the 34 camps that host refugees. \u201cPeople are going in and out of the camps freely. They are creating gatherings, the local tea-stalls are crowded. That\u2019s not good,\u201d said Mohammad Selim. He tries to keep his four children inside the home, a room divided by a mud wall, but it is difficult to keep them indoors at all times, he added.</p> <p>The lockdown has been tightened following the confirmation of new cases, according Shafi Ullah, a community leader in Kutupalong camp. He urged the authorities to lift the ban on internet services. \u201cThis will help our people\u2026the internet is a massive source of information,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Testing began in the Cox\u2019s Bazar district in early April and, as of Thursday, 108 refugees have been tested. \u201cOnce a case is confirmed we have rapid investigation teams, different health professionals and people trained in contact tracing who will investigate the case. This is happening now,\u201d said Louise Donovan, spokesperson for the UN Refugee Agency.</p> <p>Across Bangladesh, the government has so far has reported 18,863 cases of Covid-19 and 283 deaths. Dr Shamim Jahan, Save the Children\u2019s health director in the country, said in a statement the virus already had overwhelmed health services.</p> <p>\u201cThere are only an estimated 2,000 ventilators in all of Bangladesh, serving a population of 160 million people. In the Rohingya refugee camps \u2013 home to nearly a million people \u2013 there are no intensive care beds at this moment,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cNow that the virus has entered the world\u2019s largest refugee settlement in Cox\u2019s Bazar we are looking at the very real prospect that thousands of people may die from Covid-19. This pandemic could set Bangladesh back by decades.\u201d</p> <p>The Burmese Rohingya Organisation UK said the international community needed to provide greater resources to help protect Rohingya refugees, and called on the Bangladesh government to allow humanitarian work to continue in the camps.</p> <p>\u201cWe urge Bangladesh to lift all restrictions on aid groups\u2019 access to people who need them during the pandemic, and to take all necessary steps to prevent the virus from spreading further. The international community must step in and support Bangladesh in these vital efforts,\u201d said Tun Khin, president of the group, who added that an internet ban, imposed by Bangladesh, should also be lifted.</p> <p>\u201cThe Rohingya people in Cox\u2019s Bazar have fled for their lives from Myanmar, where the government is waging a brutal genocide,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world must now ensure that a disaster of epic proportions is avoided the camps where they have found safety.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Mr Z and I spent the first couple of hours of a lockdown morning exactly as our enemies would imagine, with him making me guess <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/georgeorwell\">George Orwell</a>\u2019s measure of a perfect pub.</p> <p>\u201cFags. People smoking fags,\u201d I responded immediately. \u201cIt should sell tobacco as well as cigarettes, and it also sells aspirin and stamps, and is obliging about letting you use the telephone,\u201d he corrected. I started moaning, because that is four criteria, not one, and these are not terms on which any decent person would run a quiz. I had another go \u2013 \u201cDoes the woman behind the bar know your name?\u201d \u2013 only to be shot down again. Yes, she knows your name, in Orwell pubtopia, but she also has her hair dyed in a surprising shade and calls you \u201cdear\u201d, not \u201cduckie\u201d. \u201cThis sucks,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re bad at quizzing.\u201d \u201cYou just miss pubs.\u201d</p> <p>Actually, I was missing a particular friend. She hates Orwell because she thinks he was a centrist melt. You could never live with a person that uncompromising \u2013 I am not even sure she would be a brilliant social mixer \u2013 and that is why it is so important to be able to see her whenever I like. (Her critique of Orwell is a bit more complicated than that; it is that the poor, in his telling, are always sad and never angry, which disempowers them and, crucially, makes Orwell\u2019s anger the force through which their predicament has to be alleviated. But sure, that is \u201ccentrist melt\u201d in today\u2019s money \u2013 and you will agree, I think, that you could never live with this person.)</p> <p>The great fallacy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/11/what-is-covered-in-the-uk-governments-lockdown-easing-plan\">the phased end to lockdown</a> is that we miss activities: golf, fishing, tennis, shopping, drinking coffee, eating ice-cream, visiting frivolous shops that are open even if our frivolity has been satisfied for the day. I swear, all these activities are just excuses for interactions and other people are the only reason we do them. That is the magnificent insult of golf courses being opened first \u2013 not that they are for rich people (although they are), nor for men (although that is true), but that people who play golf are those who crave human warmth the least. They should have been accommodated last.</p> <p>I want to moan about not seeing someone without having to justify how important or isolated they are. It is a given that we want to see our nearest and dearest; I also want to see my nearish and dearish. I miss the people I had steadily become quite close to, over years and years of the same conversations at the school gates, about green-energy municipal bonds, or about my fringe. We never had that gear-change conversation where we said: \u201cI know we met through school/work/hair, but I think we\u2019re actually friends now.\u201d</p> <p>I went back to the quiz. \u201cI bet he liked a bit of stained glass, Orwell.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t give you that, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d said Mr Z, in an excellent impersonation of cruelly insincere quizmaster sympathy. \u201cThere\u2019s no stained glass, just Victoriana: \u2018The grained woodwork, the ornamental mirrors behind the bar, the cast-iron fireplaces, the florid ceiling stained dark yellow by tobacco-smoke, the stuffed bull\u2019s head over the mantelpiece.\u2019\u201d \u201cOrwell doesn\u2019t understand anything. He <em>is</em> a centrist melt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWould it help if we went to a garden centre?\u201d Let me think \u2026 if there were people I knew there and we could walk up and down the plant aisles, chatting through the sides of our mouths, like John le Carr\u00e9 meets Alan Titchmarsh, although we wouldn\u2019t be talking about plants, then yes, I would consider it. \u201cThat\u2019s not a garden centre, that\u2019s a garden party,\u201d said monsieur.</p> <p>I would consider joining a tennis club if the club house were open and I didn\u2019t have to play tennis. \u201cThat\u2019s more like a dry pub.\u201d I would think about taking unlimited exercise if it were formation ice-skating and I could have a different partner every day and we didn\u2019t have to do any actual skating; I could just stand there, holding hands in a criss-cross pattern. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that is,\u201d he replied.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying I\u2019m tired of you,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, if this gets any worse, I\u2019ll have to wake up a child and talk to them instead.\u201d</p> <p>They get up at 11 now, which \u2013 with a bit of fluctuation, depending on the brightness of the sun and the new found assertiveness of the birdsong \u2013 means we have already lived six hours of the day without them. Looked at that way, for practical purposes, they are back at school. The one in year six also potentially has to go back in June. She reacted with ear-splitting rage to the news that she would probably be three months ahead of the others. I said it would be great. She said: \u201cName one great thing about school.\u201d After I had named about 35, she said witheringly: \u201cBut those are all <em>people</em>.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the point! People are the whole point of education!\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s right,\u201d she said. \u201cNo wonder you\u2019re so bad at quizzes,\u201d said Mr Z, \u201cif you think people are the point of education.\u201d \u201cAt least I don\u2019t think a stuffed bull\u2019s head is the point of a pub.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Joe Biden has had a hard time capturing the hearts of progressive Democrats. Like the media, progressive Democrats tend to see him as a centrist \u2013 a status quo candidate who just wants to return the US and the world to the pre-Trump era. Even Biden\u2019s collaborations with Bernie Sanders, including the recently announced <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/05/13/855203151/biden-and-sanders-announce-task-forces-to-find-party-unity-over-policy\">unity </a><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/05/13/855203151/biden-and-sanders-announce-task-forces-to-find-party-unity-over-policy\">task</a><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/05/13/855203151/biden-and-sanders-announce-task-forces-to-find-party-unity-over-policy\">forces</a>, are often dismissed as pure window-dressing. But this kind of blithe dismissal of the presumptive Democratic nominee misreads both the politician and the times.</p> <p>It is true that Biden was never a very progressive Democrat, but neither was he a particularly conservative one. He has been a classic \u201ccentrist Democrat\u201d. But it\u2019s important to note that this places him not in the political center of the US electorate, but in the center of the Democratic party \u2013 a party that has shifted left significantly since 2016, as has Biden.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/14/joe-biden-bernie-sanders-supporters-leftwing-voters\">Joe Biden needs to do a lot more if he wants to win over Sanders voters | Nathan Robinson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Biden is a realist. He knows when the times are a-changin\u2019. That\u2019s why he joined Barack Obama in 2008 and why he has moved to reconcile with Sanders in 2020. After two powerful primary campaigns, Biden is smart enough to acknowledge that Sanders represents the direction the party\u2019s base is moving to, and that he could shape that transformation.</p> <p>As Gabriel Debenedetti <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/05/joe-biden-presidential-plans.html\">argues</a> in his excellent New York magazine article on the Biden campaign, the Covid-19 pandemic has opened Biden\u2019s eyes to the need for a more radical approach to policy and governance. As Biden told a group of donors: \u201cThe blinders have been taken off because of this Covid crisis.\u201d</p> <p>Crises can lead to fundamental changes. While we mainly focus on the darkest consequences, such as Adolf Hitler\u2019s rise to power in the wake of the Great Depression, that same crisis also gave rise to the <a href=\"https://www.aspeninstitute.org/blog-posts/remembering-made-fdr-great/\">greatest progressive project</a> in US history: Franklin D Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal. While heralded as a \u201cradical\u201d by many today, FDR was in many ways a realpolitiker, politically expedient and adjustable to the mood of the times.</p> <p>But perhaps the best comparison would be FDR\u2019s protege <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/20/opinion/joe-biden-progressive.html\">Lyndon B Johnson</a>, the southerner who, in an atmosphere of intense polarization over civil rights and in the wake of the national trauma of the assassination of John F Kennedy, introduced some of the most important civil rights legislation in US history. As with Johnson, the current crisis provides Biden with an opportunity to step out of the shadow of his charismatic and inspiring Democratic predecessor, Obama, and become a much more transformative president.</p> <p>To be clear, this is not a foregone conclusion. Moderates, both Democrats and Republicans, also see Biden as a great opportunity, in their case to re-establish the status quo. Many of them have been around Biden for years, if not decades, and play important roles in his campaign \u2013 I\u2019m looking at you, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-biden-economy/biden-campaigns-outside-economic-advisers-include-larry-summers-idUSKCN2253QX\">Larry Summers</a>.</p> <p>But the recently announced unity taskforces \u2013 on the climate crisis, criminal justice reform, economy, education, healthcare and immigration \u2013 show a more mixed picture. First, they much better reflect the ethnic and gender diversity of the contemporary Democratic party and its electorate \u2013 with many prominent African American and Hispanic members as well as twice as many female than male co-chairs. Second, they include many prominent progressives, including Sanders surrogates such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Pramila Jayapal \u2013 hardly politicians who will accept a token role.</p> <p>While some \u201cBernie or bust\u201d keyboard warriors will invariably denounce these progressives as sellouts, and some jaded progressives as naive, they are actually realists who should be supported and strengthened. Few politicians understand the signs of the times better than Ocasio-Cortez. She knows that the country and the party are changing, and she understands that the Covid-19 crisis provides a unique opportunity to accelerate that change.</p> <p>Moreover, these progressives realize that Biden does not have a set ideology, but is in many ways an empty vessel whose domestic policies and priorities are still very much in flux and in play. In other words, progressives have two fights to fight: one for a President Biden, against the Republicans, and one for a progressive Biden presidency, against the moderate Democrats.</p> <ul> <li><p>Cas Mudde is a Guardian US columnist and the Stanley Wade Shelton UGAF professor in the school of public and international affairs at the University of Georgia.

It is mostly transmitted through tiny droplets from an infected person\u2019s nose or mouth when they cough, sneeze or talk.</p> <p>So far, at least 30 meat plant workers have died of Covid-19 complications, and more than 10,000 have been infected or exposed, according to the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union.</p> <p>On Wednesday, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-14/fourth-usda-inspector-dies-from-virus-amid-meat-plant-outbreaks\">a fourth US agriculture department (USDA) food safety inspector</a> died, this time in Dodge City, Kansas. The city is located in Ford county, where one in 28 residents is infected \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/kansas-coronavirus-cases.html\">the 11th-highest rate in the US</a>. In Kansas, outbreaks in four of the hardest-hit counties are linked to large meatpacking plants.</p> <p>Almost 300 inspectors, who have struggled to get access to adequate protective gear, are off sick with Covid-19 or under self-quarantine due to exposure, said the USDA, which regulates about 6,500 plants, including 300 or so factories with more than 500 employees.</p> <p>The deregulation of slaughterhouses and meatpacking plants over the past two decades has increased output and profits at the cost of health and safety, according to advocates .</p> <p>Even before the pandemic, the industry was riddled with \u201cserious safety and health hazards \u2026 including dangerous equipment, musculoskeletal disorders, and hazardous chemicals,\u201d according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.</p> <p>\u201cThe pandemic has shone a light on the meat industry where for years workers have been exploited in these plants including being penalized for not showing up even when they are sick or injured. Even now, it\u2019s taken plants to be shut down for companies to provide protective gear for workers,\u201d said Tony Corbo, a senior lobbyist at the not-for-profit Food &amp; Water Watch.</p> <p>At least 30 plants have suspended operations over the past two months, and scores more have reduced operations amid a growing public outcry about working conditions for mostly migrant workers.</p> <p>But many are now starting to reopen \u2013 a move encouraged by Donald Trump, who, in an attempt to fend off unrest about meat shortages in supermarkets, last month declared meat processing plants to be critical infrastructure.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2020/05/12/latest-on-covid19-in-mn\">In Nobles county</a>, Minnesota, almost 500 workers at a large Brazilian-owned JBS pork plant have tested positive. The outbreak rapidly spread through the county, with 1,291 confirmed cases as of Wednesday compared with just a handful in mid-April. About one in 17 people in the county have now tested positive, though the infection is now slowing.</p> <p>The Nobles plant reopened last week after two weeks closed. It <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/jbs-to-reopen-worthington-pork-plant-smithfield-opening-in-sioux-falls/570182612/?refresh=true\">has reportedly introduced a host of safety measures</a>, including face shields for those working in close proximity. </p> <p>Congress will vote on Friday on another Covid-19 rescue package, which includes mandatory health and safety regulations for all essential workers, including meat processing and care-home staff.</p>",
  "<p>Camels laze in the shade of 2,300-year old columns. Centre stage at the amphitheatre is temporarily reserved for goats. The noise of crowds in front of the treasury \u2013 the most recognisable and best preserved feature of the ancient city of Petra \u2013 has evaporated, and only birdsong intrudes on the silence.</p> <p>This is peak season of what was supposed to be a record year for tourism in Jordan\u2019s crown jewel, the Nabataean metropolis carved into kaleidoscopic rock. But the last tourists left the Middle Eastern kingdom on 17 March, just before it shut its borders because of coronavirus, and since then Petra and the surrounding towns have been deserted.</p> <p>\u201cWe just had our best year since the Arab spring, which affected us really badly,\u201d says Jihad Kaldany, a guide who specialises in taking Christian tourists through the country\u2019s Old Testament sites. Those visitors tended to be older people, the demographic most at risk of the virus. \u201cIf we knew it would be better in, say, two years, we could plan. But there is no assurance. Nobody knows.\u201d</p> <p>The site in southern Jordan is one of the centres of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/may/07/world-tourism-faces-worst-crisis-since-records-began-says-unwto-report\">an unprecedented crisis</a> for the global tourism industry, with 120 million livelihoods under threat and no end in sight.</p> <p>But the empty streets, hotel rooms and restaurants in Wadi Musa, the town that serves as gateway to Petra, also illustrate the dire challenge facing middle and lower-income countries over the next years. Most, like Jordan, have so far avoided the worst of the virus. They will not be spared the economic blow, with countries that were banking on tourism and hospitality to be major engines of their growth projected to suffer most, according to <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2020/04/14/weo-april-2020\">the International Monetary Fund</a>.</p> <p>Surviving for long stretches without rainfall was the test of Petra\u2019s original inhabitants. How to survive a year without tourists is the challenge facing its modern ones.</p> <p>\u201cIn a community like Wadi Musa, up to 80% of people rely on tourism as their source of income,\u201d says Suleiman Farajat, the chief commissioner of the Petra tourism authority. Across Jordan, tourism contributes about 15% of the country\u2019s GDP and sustains an estimated 55,000 jobs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"37a0d8510d472d23f809bbe046f22902a2c62e28\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37a0d8510d472d23f809bbe046f22902a2c62e28/0_234_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tourists outside the ancient treasury at Petra in 2015.

Suleiman Hasanaat was preparing to open a new hotel in late March. \u201cAs soon as they stopped the flights, all reservations were cancelled,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The cost of the global lockdown is spreading through the town. \u201cIf you run a hotel, you buy vegetables and fruit from the markets,\u201d Hasanaat says. \u201cYou employ people include maintenance and taxi drivers. The people with donkeys and horses. Those running small stores that depend on walk-in tourists. Even the people in the Turkish baths in the city. In every single family in Petra, there is somebody affected by this.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1edb1a75f9fe0164d19d59448d33c5582b1668bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1edb1a75f9fe0164d19d59448d33c5582b1668bd/209_0_3200_4000/800.jpg\" alt=\"Umar Ayyad is surviving on small grants from the government, remittances from his brother in Europe, and by selling his sheep.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Umar Ayyad is surviving on small grants from the government, remittances from his brother in Europe, and by selling his sheep.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Safi/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just as for the hundreds of years <a href=\"https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/the-man-who-discovered-a-%E2%80%98lost%E2%80%99-wonder-of-the-world\">before the site was \u201crediscovered\u201d</a> by a Swiss explorer in 1812, Bedouin people are the only sign of life inside the sandstone city. \u201cWe\u2019re tired of doing nothing,\u201d says Umar Ayyad, 36, riding a donkey in the midday glare.</p> <p>He says he used to earn about 30 dinars (\u00a334) every day selling rides to tourists, enough to support his six children. He\u2019s survived so far on small grants from the government, remittances from his brother in Europe, and by selling his 17 sheep to settle debts. But he needs to pay down his balance at a local market by the end of the month to keep buying groceries, and money is already running short. \u201cIf the situation continues like this, it\u2019s a problem,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Governments in developed countries are scrambling to weave again the safety nets some have spent the past four decades unpicking. The welfare system in Jordan is relatively advanced compared with many of its neighbours, but still has huge gaps.</p> <p>Fewer than half of Jordanian workers are registered with the country\u2019s social security system, which is already rationing its welfare payments. Without external aid, the fund could run dry within months.</p> <p>The rest of the country\u2019s workforce, including tens of thousands of migrant workers, have no safety net at all, and are totally exposed to the vagaries and predations of the market.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the everything we\u2019ve made in the past two months,\u201d Muadth gestures at the handful of bills in the cash register, at a convenience store a few metres from Petra\u2019s gates.</p> <p>The Yemeni, in sandals and a corduroy suit jacket, arrived in the tourist hub a year ago. Even in bad months, he says, he could send about 200 dinars home to his family in Sana\u2019a. \u201cNow, nothing,\u201d he says. \u201cMy younger brother sells water and the family lives off that.\u201d</p> <p>His debts include to a pastry shop owner who sponsored his working visa a year ago. The pair had a falling out, and the man refuses to give back his passport unless Muadth can pay him for the cost of his working permit, he says. \u201cI called him yesterday and said, listen, I\u2019m not earning any money. He told me: deal with it. Sort something out.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c334d7a985387dea16563150a3de86d1b8d35ae4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c334d7a985387dea16563150a3de86d1b8d35ae4/0_286_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Umar Ayyad: \u2018We\u2019re tired of doing nothing.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Umar Ayyad: \u2018We\u2019re tired of doing nothing.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Safi/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Jordanian government is trying to cushion the impact on the tourist industry by waiving some fees, postponing utility bills and offering loans to hotel owners and other stakeholders. Those measures might work in situations where tourist numbers have simply fallen, says Hasanaat, but when they are zero for months on end, more is needed.</p> <p>\u201cWe are indebted to our government for the lockdown,\u201d he says. \u201cThey controlled [the virus]. We are in secure hands. But as soon as Jordan becomes a corona-free country, we will look around and see most industries are okay \u2013 but not tourism. Petra will die without direct support or loan packages.\u201d</p> <p>To entice people back, tourism authorities are developing plans to market Petra as a safe destination in a post-Covid world. \u201cWe rely on outdoor tourism, which means that people are not stuck in closed areas,\u201d Farajat says. \u201cWe will regulate the flow of tourists so that no large numbers are in close proximity.\u201d</p> <p>He expects a few thousand foreigners to return this year, perhaps followed by a few hundred thousand next year. It will take several years, in the best case, to return to the heights of 2019, he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>A few days after Jordan closed its borders,<em><strong> </strong></em>Hasanaat went to Petra alone. \u201cI just wanted to see it,\u201d he said. \u201cI just had this feeling \u2013 that I wanted to see it without tourists.\u201d</p> <p>It was still dark as he strolled through the city, and he watched the sun come up in front of the treasury\u2019s towering facade. \u201cI stayed in front of it for two or three hours,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a very sad feeling, walking alone.

  "<p>The British-born Zen master <a href=\"https://tricycle.org/magazine/houn-jiyu-kennet-roshi/\">Roshi Jiyu-Kennett</a> used to say that her philosophy, when it came to teaching students, wasn\u2019t to try to lighten the burdens they carried through life, but to make those burdens so heavy they\u2019d choose to put them down. I\u2019m no Zen master (I do have the requisite baldness; it\u2019s just that I\u2019m still working on the boundless equanimity). But I\u2019ve always loved that line, because it gets at something profound about the stressfulness of existence.</p> <p>To spell out what I take from it, which is something a Zen master would never do: most of us subliminally spend our days scrambling to get to a point where we feel like life\u2019s finally in working order, and everything\u2019s under control \u2013 which for you might mean total financial security, becoming the perfect parent, leaving your childhood traumas entirely behind, or anything else.</p> <p>The \u201cburden-lightening\u201d approach, as preached in a thousand self-help books, involves somehow actually reaching that place of safety. The burden-increasing approach, by contrast, involves pointing out that the goal was impossible all along. And when you grasp that you were chasing a mirage, you\u2019re <a href=\"https://www.lionsroar.com/you-dont-have-to-know-tales-of-trauma-and-transformation-march-2013/\">disinclined</a> to keep chasing. You get to <a href=\"https://onedharmanashville.wordpress.com/2011/01/09/pema-chodron-on-the-benefits-of-hopelessness/\">relax into life</a> as it is.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Right now, all sorts of things we tell ourselves we need to do \u2013 to be happy, or secure \u2013 have been impossible to do</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Which is easier said than done. Though perhaps slightly easier than usual right now, at a time when all sorts of things we tend to tell ourselves we need to do \u2013 to be happy, or secure, or to justify our existence \u2013 have been rather obviously impossible to do. You just <em>can\u2019t</em> do a full-time job at full throttle while caring for small children; you <em>can\u2019t </em>be absolutely certain your relatives are safe from the pandemic; you <em>can\u2019t </em>guarantee your family won\u2019t feel the shocks of economic meltdown. Etcetera. </p> <p>Of course, realising this doesn\u2019t magically make it fine to be overstretched, sick or struggling financially. But it triggers a kind of inner liberation. You\u2019re still in a bad fix, but you\u2019re no longer staking everything on achieving an impossible kind of escape from it. Moreover, the result of this shift isn\u2019t that you become passively resigned to your fate. Instead, you\u2019re more motivated to take whatever useful actions you can.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/08/how-to-have-fun-during-lockdown-oliver-burkeman\">How to have fun during lockdown | Oliver Burkeman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Recently, I\u2019ve noticed that I read the news with a similar subconscious yearning for something impossible: deep down, I think I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ll find some confirmation, somewhere among the headlines, that everything will eventually be OK with the world. So there\u2019s a certain solace in realising that things already <em>aren\u2019t </em>OK. That ship has sailed.

The quarter-on-quarter contraction is \u201cthe worst since the financial crisis\u201d in 2009, the federal statistics office Destatis said. The agency also revised its gross domestic product figure for the final quarter of 2019 from zero growth to a contraction of 0.1%, meaning Germany has now experienced two consecutive quarters of contraction \u2013 the technical definition of a recession.</p> <h2><strong>Slovenia proclaims end to the outbreak</strong></h2> <p>Slovenia has become the first European country to proclaim <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/15/coronavirus-live-news-trump-says-he-could-cut-china-ties-as-global-deaths-pass-300000-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ebe5e298f08898ae6891192#block-5ebe5e298f08898ae6891192\">an end to the coronavirus epidemic</a> at home.

  "<p>Lockdown isn\u2019t much fun for parents of small children, who now find themselves attempting round-the-clock childcare while possibly juggling work as well, and with the added hassle of overseeing a schedule of schoolwork.</p> <p>I\u2019ve found that the best way to cope \u2013 aside from a renewed interest in drinking \u2013 has been to get the kids involved in cooking. Mine are young (five and two), but if they can help out at dinnertime a little, I\u2019ve decided that it counts as home-schooling. Here are a few tricks that I\u2019ve discovered to gain their interest, as well as some expert tips.</p> <h2>1. Bake, bake, bake</h2> <p>Assuming you\u2019ve achieved the tricky task of sourcing flour, bread dough should be your new best friend. It\u2019s simple enough that older kids can make it themselves with light supervision, and sturdy enough that smaller kids can give it a real battering if they want. The highlight of our day is now the knockback stage, because it gives my children a chance to punch something other than each other. Another really good starting point is cake-mix packets. There\u2019s no technique to them; just a cracked egg and some oil. The big kid cracks the egg, the little kid pours the oil and then they each get a spoon to mix and (most importantly) lick. The cakes aren\u2019t very good, but it kills half an hour, so whatever.</p> <h2>2. Check you have all the ingredients first</h2> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/chefs/mary_anne_boerman\">Mary-Anne Boermans</a> from series two of The Great British Bake Off says: \u201cMake sure you have the ingredients before you suggest a recipe. Nothing kills the mood faster than a promise unfulfilled. If you\u2019ve suggested brownies, then find you have no cocoa, a Nutella sandwich is going to be a hard sell.\u201d Also, adds the food writer <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/signesjohansen/\">Signe Johansen</a>, it doesn\u2019t hurt to have everything prepped before the kids arrive on the scene. \u201cAvoid wasting ingredients by measuring out as much as you can before you start,\u201d she says. \u201cDepending on how old the kids are, ingredients can go flying or fall on the floor.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2dcff073ed52355da984588c04897e84a6d292b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2dcff073ed52355da984588c04897e84a6d292b/0_118_5411_3246/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Starting the learning process is way more important than a perfect cake.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Starting the learning process is way more important than a perfect cake.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>3. It\u2019s about having fun \u2013 not perfect results</h2> <p>Let the kids take the lead. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/david-atherton\">David Atherton</a> \u2013 2019\u2019s Bake Off winner and author of the forthcoming My First Cook Book \u2013 says: \u201cIt\u2019s not fun if you\u2019re always controlling it all. Having fun and starting the learning process around food is way more important than the perfect fluffy cake.\u201d Incidentally, Atherton\u2019s recipe for near-instant banana ice-cream is a winner. Take two frozen bananas, two spoons of yoghurt, a teaspoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of malt extract. Blend until smooth.</p> <h2>4. Try one-pan dishes</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/chefs/rukmini_iyer\">Rukmini Iyer</a>, the author of the Roasting Tin series of books (the latest is The Roasting Tin Around the World), advocates getting kids involved in one-pan dish assembly. \u201cThere\u2019s no stovetop stirring, so less chance of falling off a kitchen chair or sticking tiny hands into hot oil. Replace hot oil with boiling sugar syrup and you have my first kitchen burn, at the proud age of four years old. Ovens are, blissfully, self-contained.\u201d</p> <h2>5. Make things they\u2019ll want to eat</h2> <p>Start small with things they actually want to eat. If they like pasta, let them throw the pasta into the saucepan. If they like mash, let them mash the potatoes. Anecdotally, this may result in your kid demanding that everyone around the table thanks them for single-handedly making dinner, but better that than wiping clumps of mash off the walls. At the same time, the pride of making dinner may help them overcome some of their food weirdness. As Atherton says: \u201cYour child will eat a lot of foods they usually refuse if they\u2019ve been involved in the cooking.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97f726b031358ad484fbf990729e851e6f0fc07d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97f726b031358ad484fbf990729e851e6f0fc07d/0_0_8688_5213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The pride of playing a part may help them overcome some of their food weirdness.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The pride of playing a part may help them overcome some of their food weirdness.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacob Lund/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>6. Keep it simple</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/nov/28/mince-pies-tasted-by-baker-alice-fevronia-it-screams-christmas\">Alice Fevronia</a> \u2013 a teacher and 2019 Bake Off alumna \u2013 suggests picking recipes that the kids won\u2019t absolutely ruin. \u201cStick to simple recipes that don\u2019t need to be too precise, and allow them to make decisions in adding additional things they want to. Flapjacks and cookies are a good place to start.\u201d The chef Romy Gill likes to present her kids with a single ingredient \u2013 say a fruit, vegetable or pulse \u2013 and ask them to list everything they can make with it. With potatoes, for instance. \u201cI do this stuffed Indian flatbread called aloo paratha, spicy chips or a mashed potato bake with carrots, spinach, beans, cheese and a little bit of cream or butter.\u201d However, \u201cthey are not a fan of jacket potatoes. School has ruined them\u201d. The best way to meal plan, especially when young kids are involved, can be to limit the options, says Boermans: \u201cDon\u2019t give too much freedom because tiny brains can\u2019t cope. Don\u2019t ask: \u2018What do you want to make?\u2019 Rather: \u2018Do you want soup or a sandwich?\u2019 It\u2019s still their choice, just with a bit more focus.\u201d</p> <h2>7. Embrace kids\u2019 adventurous side</h2> <p>Iyer recommends embracing stranger ingredients. \u201cI enjoy handing over particularly offensive or strong-smelling items, such as fish sauce, to nieces and getting them to think of as many words as possible to describe the smell. It\u2019s always worth handing over new and \u2018weird\u2019 ingredients, and seeing if anyone will try them as a dare. Peer pressure works wonders if you\u2019ve got a bolder kid in the mix.\u201d</p> <h2>8. Don\u2019t wait until they\u2019re hungry</h2> <p>More first-hand lockdown advice: don\u2019t wait until the kids are hungry before bringing them into the kitchen because their patience will be shot and \u2013 this is entirely hypothetical and in no way related to the precise thing that happened to me three days ago \u2013 your two-year-old will have an hour-long screaming fit on the floor because you wouldn\u2019t let him eat a raw egg.</p> <h2>9. Avoid the oven if you have to</h2> <p>Short on flour, and cooking with children you don\u2019t trust around heat? Make a fridge cake. Johansen recommends the cherry, almond and dark chocolate tiffin from her book Solo. Once you\u2019ve melted the chocolate \u2013 and mixed the butter, egg and golden syrup together \u2013 you have a perfect base to throw in biscuits and anything else you like. (Johansen uses sour cherries and flaked almonds.) Then you pour it all into a clingfilmed loaf tin and leave it to chill in the fridge overnight \u2013 if they can wait that long.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2fb9a32697a62ff837864fff6fa0ea6f8f38d248\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2fb9a32697a62ff837864fff6fa0ea6f8f38d248/0_0_5220_3134/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018If you praise them, they\u2019ll make it again.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If you praise them, they\u2019ll make it again.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yagi Studio/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>10. Offer feedback</h2> <p>\u201cIf you praise them for what they\u2019ve made,\u201d says Boermans, \u201cthen it can be used to cajole them into making it again. \u2018I loved that ham sandwich you made. Will you help me make another one?\u2019\u201d</p> <h2>11. Chill out</h2> <p>There are hundreds of ice lolly recipes online. Most just require fruit juice that the kids can pour into the moulds themselves. And then, while they wait for them to freeze, they get to learn the art of patience. Imagine.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47493366f571333d3e2bceff1da8ea53fa8b0563\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47493366f571333d3e2bceff1da8ea53fa8b0563/0_260_5913_3549/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Don\u2019t forget it\u2019s supposed to be fun.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Don\u2019t forget it\u2019s about having fun.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darrin Jenkins/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>12. Remember their attention spans</h2> <p>Speaking of patience, don\u2019t assume that your children will have limitless amounts of it. When we\u2019re making cookies, for instance, my kids\u2019 interest is only sparked by three things: when we\u2019re measuring the flour (because it\u2019s the first part of a new activity), when we\u2019re shaping the dough (because it\u2019s fun) and when they come out of the oven (because food). For the rest of it, I\u2019m on my own. We would all have a much worse time if I insisted on keeping their noses to the grindstone for the duration.</p> <h2>13. Go to a farm shop</h2> <p>We\u2019ve been leaning heavily on the local farm shop during lockdown, and the benefit of this is that the vegetables are much dirtier than their supermarket equivalent. As a result, the kids now have a better understanding that their food was grown in the ground.

Everyone loves popcorn, pastry and potatoes</h2> <p>Buy some popping corn. If you\u2019re a toddler, popcorn is fireworks that you eat. And I\u2019ve discovered that pre-rolled pastry has yet to become scarce. Get your kids to cut it into squares, place a bit of bacon in the middle, fold it up, put cheese on the top and then bake until golden. It\u2019s like Greggs is still a thing. Returning to the humble spud, the first thing I ever cooked at school was a baked potato. I took a potato to school, and gave it to the home economics teacher. She put it in the oven and then, when class started two hours later, she took it out of the oven and I ate it. If was good enough for the national curriculum in 1991, it\u2019s good enough now.</p> <h2>15. None of this really matters</h2> <p>If you don\u2019t have the ingredients or the time to do any of these, or your kids aren\u2019t showing any interest in cooking, please remember that none of this really matters. We\u2019re all being asked to do something unprecedented at the moment. Just getting everyone to the end of the day in one piece counts as a victory. All the other stuff can wait. Actually, though, this is the most important point, and it\u2019s based on the horrified look on my wife\u2019s face after she came downstairs and saw my two-year-old squidging sopping-wet bread dough between his fingers just now. The tip is this: whatever you do, use aprons.</p>",

  "<p>Welcome to our weekly roundup of developments from the coronavirus pandemic. As new cases emerged in countries that relaxed their restrictions and businesses struggled to weather the storm, the World Health Organization warned that the disease may never go away.</p> \n<p><strong>Vaccine hopes and fears</strong></p> \n<p>An experimental vaccine that is being given to hundreds of people in an accelerated trial has passed an important milestone. A single shot of the Oxford University vaccine was found to protect a small number of monkeys from serious coronavirus infections. The six animals who received the jab produced antibodies to the virus within a month which appeared to prevent lung damage caused by the virus. The virus was still active in the nose, according to a <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.13.093195v1?fbclid=IwAR1Xb79A0cGjORE2nwKTEvBb7y4-NBuD5oRf2wKWZfAhoCJ8_T73QSQfskw\">preliminary report</a> posted on the bioRxiv preprint server.</p> \n<p>The news came days after the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, conceded that there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/11/coronavirus-live-news-white-house-task-force-hit-by-infection-us-usa-vp-mike-pence-donald-trump-boris-johnsons-uk-lockdown-plans-criticised?page=with:block-5eb99f428f08a55ecde580eb#block-5eb99f428f08a55ecde580eb\">no guarantee a vaccine would work</a>, though his chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, was more upbeat, saying: \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if we didn\u2019t end up with something.\u201d</p> \n<p>A working vaccine is not enough if rich countries buy up all the shots and leave poorer countries unprotected.

In evidence to a Senate hearing, Fauci went on to warn of dire consequences if the US opened too soon and urged caution over reopening schools.

  "<p>I had spent my life \u2013 44 years \u2013 in Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras. Everything was there: my husband, our children, the street-side food stall that I own and have run for years.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t an easy decision to leave, but my country has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/11/migrants-fleeing-central-america-guatemala-honduras-el-salvador-family-taken-killed-study\" title=\"\">descended into anarchy</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/13/honduras-maras-gangs-deaths-kids\" title=\"\">maras</a> (violent gangs) were demanding protection money from people like me every week. Young gang members, the same age as my teenage son, would come to take what I couldn\u2019t afford. We needed to get out.</p> <p>I made the decision to join my siblings in the Mexican city of Monterrey. I\u2019d go alone at first, and once I was settled my family would join me. At least, that was the plan.</p> <p>In September 2019, I left for Chiapas on Mexico\u2019s southern border, but after two months there, my application for asylum in Mexico had made no progress. I was lonely, had no money, and a man I feared to be a gang member had started to follow me. Desperate, I decided it was time to stop waiting and instead catch <em>El tren de la muerte \u2013</em> the death train. People looking to travel north jump aboard these notoriously dangerous cargo trains as they snake through Mexico to the border with the United States.</p> <p>Riding the train isn\u2019t easy. I\u2019d heard stories of people dying as they clambered aboard their roofs, or crammed on to the small platforms that connect the carriages, which stretch out as far as the eye can see. But what choice did I have?</p> <p>Chiapas is where the line starts, but you\u2019ve got to be prepared to depart at any time; there\u2019s no set schedule. I nervously waited in a park nearby. My small backpack was filled only with water, bread and a change of clothes: you have to be nimble. At 3pm we heard a whistle, our signal. I prayed as I, and about a thousand others, ran towards the train.</p> <p>It took three days and nights of holding on, squashed tightly with a stranger on the small platforms, to arrive in Coatzacoalcos, our first stop. There wasn\u2019t much time until our next departure, but my new friends and I were hungry. We stood on a bridge and ate, listening out for the whistle. When it came, though, <em>La Migra</em> <em>(</em>immigration police) stood by our train grabbing people. We decided to climb aboard another train farther down the line. It would be much more dangerous \u2013 we would have to board while it was still moving.</p> <p>As soon as our path was clear, we rushed towards the train, its speed rapidly increasing. Everyone was scrambling to make it up, bumping into each other, desperately clinging on. I passed up my rucksack to a boy I recognised from the last leg and made a jump for it. That\u2019s when I fell.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/17/experience-my-brother-framed-me-for-murder\">Experience: my brother framed me for murder</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I woke up on the floor, confused and in pain. A crowd had gathered, but I had no idea what was going on. It took an hour for an ambulance to arrive, and in that time I tried as best I could to avoid looking down at my body. I knew something was wrong but I wasn\u2019t prepared to see it. Migrants and Mexicans alike tried to cheer me up as I waited, but I just prayed through the panic. The next thing I remember is waking up in hospital after having had an operation: both my legs had been amputated.</p> <p>Sedated, I asked the nurse to call my sister in Monterrey to explain what had happened: the train had run me over, and my legs were immediately crushed. A day or two later she arrived at my bedside, looked me up and down, and started to smile. She hugged me and whispered: \u201cYou\u2019re alive here with us, that\u2019s what matters. You might not have your little feet, but we still have you.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ve spent the last three months in a recovery house in Coatzacoalcos, healing, learning and adjusting. My son has come to support me, and I hope my other children will soon follow him here to study. In March, my husband died in an accident which means, despite everything, I\u2019ll have to fight twice as hard. I want to start a YouTube channel to help people who\u2019ve gone through what I have. I need help to get a good pair of prosthetics \u2013 at the moment I still can\u2019t walk. Because of Covid-19, my support from <a href=\"https://www.msf.org.uk/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIuNDN472N6QIVmK3tCh2xeQBqEAAYASAAEgKLtvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\" title=\"\">M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res</a> is taking place via phone.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know how quickly I\u2019ll recover, or if I\u2019ll ever get my papers. But I still hope that one day, God permitting, I\u2019ll make it to Monterrey to be with my family.</p> <p>\u2022 As told to Michael Segalov.</p> <p>Do you have an experience to share?

  "<p>When I booked my flight home after spending more than two-and-a-half months in Europe, I knew what my journey would entail. With no more direct flights between Paris and Hong Kong, I would have a brief layover in London. I knew that when I landed at the Hong Kong airport, I would be tested and held at a facility for roughly eight hours until my results came back.</p> <p>In the best case scenario \u2013 if I were negative \u2013 I would be spending two weeks in home quarantine, my whereabouts tracked by an app and a chunky device worn on my wrist. If I were positive, I would be sent to the hospital.</p> <p>I\u2019m used to traveling alone, but I wasn\u2019t expecting the feeling of isolation as I moved from one dystopian scene to another. Flying long haul has never been stranger.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/confusion-reigns-life-inside-hong-kongs-coronavirus-quarantine-centres\">'Confusion reigns': life inside Hong Kong's coronavirus quarantine centres</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Heathrow, like Paris\u2019 Charles de Gaulle Airport, was eerily quiet. I was alone when I went through security. All of the shops and restaurants were closed, there was no music or boarding announcements, and none of the usual din of tens of thousands of passengers making their way to their gates. Looking at the handful of flights listed on the announcement board, I realised that I could safely assume that any other passenger I encountered in the terminal was on my flight.</p> <p>Once we had all boarded, the captain remarked over the PA system that there were only about 100 passengers and that we would all be entering a quarantine of some sort when we landed. He didn\u2019t expect any delays; the skies were empty.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac21198e69f6245baa303c43fd08bc406f102133\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac21198e69f6245baa303c43fd08bc406f102133/405_0_3397_2553/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Workers wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) assist arriving passengers to board a bus to a coronavirus testing facility in Hong Kong.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"752\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Workers wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) assist arriving passengers to board a bus to a coronavirus testing facility in Hong Kong.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurel Chor/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When you fly from one international hub to another in normal life, you never know where your fellow passengers are coming from, where they\u2019re going, or what they\u2019ll be doing when they land. But this time \u2013 with Hong Kong allowing only residents in \u2013 I knew that we had all chosen to return, for one reason or another, and to accept what came next.</p> <p>Hong Kong, despite tens of millions crossing its border with mainland China every year, has only had 1,052 cases of Covid-19 and four related deaths in a city of 7.4 million. Until Wednesday, when a 66-year-old woman with no recent travel history was confirmed to be infected, every single new case that Hong Kong had recorded in the previous 23 days had been imported from abroad \u2013 meaning none of the patients had caught the virus within the city itself.</p> <p>The British Airways staff member who greeted us on the plane and directed us to our seats wore a mask and gloves, but for the remainder of the journey, the rest of the crew did not. In absurd contrast, some of the passengers wore full-body protective suits, plastic face shields, goggles and gloves. Every single one wore a face mask. The passengers were calm, with none of the usual stressed urgency of air travel: no one was in a hurry to get anywhere.</p> <p>Inside the confines of the plane, it was as if passengers and cabin crew functioned in parallel universes: flight attendants served food and drink as normal \u2013 an act impossible to perform without being at least within an arm\u2019s reach \u2013 to people wearing levels of protection normally reserved for highly dangerous environments.</p> <h2>Arriving in Hong Kong</h2> <p>When we landed in Hong Kong 12 hours later, people were patient and cooperative, though they politely kept their distance from each other. We were all being treated as we were potentially infected. There was the sense that we all knew that we were traveling under extraordinary circumstances and everyone was doing their best to do their part.</p> <p>We were herded through station after station, each with its own discrete purpose. At one, we got health forms and orders. Before we could advance, we had to download a tracking app. At another, someone recorded our phone numbers and checked that they worked. Someone gave us our tracking bracelets, and someone else activated them. A health official signed and stamped my quarantine order and gave me a thermometer, explaining I was to record my temperature twice a day. He told me not to worry, and assured me that assuming I were negative, I would be eating dim sum on the morning of the 28th.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7cbe44ce74b0b0f9eb6fe2334cdb3b9f39b3c1c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7cbe44ce74b0b0f9eb6fe2334cdb3b9f39b3c1c5/0_116_3088_1853/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laurel Chor in the testing centre in Hong Kong\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laurel Chor in the testing centre in Hong Kong</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurel Chor</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I went through immigration, picked up my luggage and cleared customs. But I wasn\u2019t heading home. We were herded onto a bus that took us to a convention centre nearbythat had been converted into a testing facility. We stood in line \u2013 separated by at least a metre from one another \u2013 and a health worker gave us testing kits as well as tag numbers to wear around our necks. She patiently explained how to perform the test on myself. Afterwards, we had to watch an instructional video in a giant hall, where the video played on repeat on three large screens in front of dozens of equally spaced chairs.</p> <p>In the next hall, I was assigned a testing booth, where I could hock up saliva from deep in my throat \u2013 the government video instructed us to make a \u201ckruuua\u201d sound \u2013 and spit into a tube in semi-privacy. I handed it in and was taken to a hall where I was given my own table and chair, with a welcome note, \u201chouse rules\u201d and a rubbish bag. Later, a food cart brought sandwiches and water bottles. As the hours passed, the food cart came by again with chocolate digestives and crackers. </p> <p>Seven hours later, they finally announced that passengers from my flight would be released. Our tag numbers were called. I went up to the counter and was told my test came back negative. I was given a second test kit, which I am to perform on myself again in 12 days. I was free to go home, where I have to stay for the next two weeks.</p> <p><br><br></p>",

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2><strong>Global death toll passes 302,000</strong></h2> <p>The global toll from Covid-19 has passed 300,000, with nearly 4.5 million people infected. According to data collected by Johns Hopkins University, at least 302,452 people have now died as a result of the outbreak. The institution says it has counted 4,443,597 confirmed cases worldwide. It\u2019s important to point out that the actual death toll is believed to be far higher than the tally compiled from government figures.</p> <h2><strong>China marks one month with no new coronavirus deaths announced</strong></h2> <p>China has gone a month without announcing any new deaths from the coronavirus. The National Health Commission reported four new cases of the virus on Friday, all local cross-infections in the northeastern province of Jilin where a cluster of uncertain origin has been detected in recent days. The last time the commission reported a death was on 14 April.</p> <h2><strong>Trump threatens to cut China ties</strong></h2> <p>US President Donald Trump signalled a further deterioration of his relationship with China over coronavirus, saying he has no interest in speaking to President Xi Jinping at the moment and going so far as to suggest he could cut ties with the world\u2019s second largest economy. Chinese state media has responded saying his comments are \u201clunacy\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Trump visits a mask distribution centre without wearing a mask himself</strong></h2> <p>Donald Trump toured a mask distribution centre in the political swing state of Pennsylvania on Thursday but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/donald-trump-mask-medical-equipment-facility-pennsylvania\">without wearing a mask himself</a>. Trump, who is running for re-election in November, has resisted wearing a mask in public despite his administration\u2019s guidance to Americans to wear them and new White House rules requiring staff to wear them at work.</p> <h2><strong>Mexico sees record one-day increase in cases</strong></h2> <p>Mexico\u2019s health ministry on Thursday confirmed 257 additional coronavirus deaths and 2,409 new infections, the biggest one-day rise in cases since the pandemic began.The new infections brought confirmed coronavirus cases to 42,595 and 4,477 deaths in total, according to the official tally.</p> <h2><strong>Brazil confirmed cases pass 200,000</strong></h2> <p>The number of cases in Brazil passed 200,000 on Thursday.The country now has 202,918 confirmed cases, with 13,944 added in last 24 hours, according to health ministry.The tally means it is the sixth-worst-affected country worldwide in terms of cases, according to John Hopkins data.844 new deaths were reported in last 24 hours, bringing the total to 13,993.</p> <h2><strong>South Korea, China and Japan health ministers to hold video conference</strong></h2> <p>The health ministers of South Korea, China and Japan will get together by video conference on Friday to discuss ways to work together in the global campaign against the novel coronavirus, South Korean officials said. The meeting is the first between top health officials of the East Asian neighbours since the outbreak emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.</p> <h2><strong>Doctors in Italy and France report spike in rare inflammatory syndrome linked to coronavirus</strong></h2> <p>Doctors in northern Italy,<strong> </strong>one of the areas hardest hit by coronavirus, and in France have reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/13/italian-doctors-find-link-between-covid-19-and-inflammatory-disorder\">spikes in cases of a rare inflammatory</a> syndrome in young children that appears similar to one reported in the US, Britain and Spain, according to a report in the Lancet.The condition shares symptoms with toxic shock and Kawasaki disease including fever, rashes, swollen glands and, in severe cases, heart inflammation.</p> <h2>Covid-19 reaches refugee camps in Bangladesh</h2> <p>A Rohingya man has become the first person to test positive for Covid-19 in the vast refugee camps in Bangladesh that is home to almost one million people. Local health coordinator Abu Toha Bhuiyan initially said two refugees had been put into isolation. The World Health Organization later said one case was of a Rohingya man, and the other was of a local man who lived near the camp and was being treated at a clinic inside the area.</p> <h2><strong>36 million Americans are now unemployed</strong></h2> <p>Another 3 million Americans filed for benefits, bringing the country\u2019s total unemployed to 36 million. The latest figures from the Department of Labor show the rate of claims is slowing but the record-breaking pace of layoffs has already pushed unemployment to levels unseen since the Great Depression of the 1930s.</p>",
  "<p>An escalation of rhetoric between Donald Trump and <strong>China </strong>over the coronavirus pandemic has sparked concerns that a trade deal between the nations is in peril, as Chinese state media dismissed as \u201clunacy\u201d a suggestion by the US president that he could \u201ccut off relations\u201d with Beijing.</p> \n<p>The<strong> US</strong> president said he was very disappointed with China\u2019s failure to contain Covid-19 in an interview with Fox Business news.

Gig economy workers will be covered, as they are sole traders.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday 28 April <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/treasury-officials-defend-delay-in-rollout-of-130bn-jobkeeper-scheme\">Treasury officials said</a> that 540,000 employers had formally registered for the jobkeeper wage subsidy scheme, covering an estimated 3.3m employees.</p> \n<h2>What if I am on a temporary visa?</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/scott-morrison\">Scott Morrison</a> explained that New Zealanders on 444 visas would get the payment because \u201cthey are part of an ongoing economy in Australia\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are about keeping them part of it economy because they are part of what happens on the other side,\u201d he told reporters in Canberra.</p> \n<p>The government has announced it will allow backpackers to extend their stay in Australia and most temporary visa holders to access superannuation payments early.</p> \n<p>Seasonal workers will be exempt from a rule that normally prevents them from staying with the same employer for more than six months.</p> \n<p>Any seasonal workers will have to self-isolate for 14 days before they start working in regional communities.</p> \n<h2>How will it be paid?</h2> \n<p>Eligible employers will have to pay $1,500 per fortnight per eligible employee from 30 March 2020, and will be reimbursed monthly in arrears starting from 1 May.</p> \n<p>Employers have until 8 May to make payments for April, but can join the scheme at any time. Jobkeeper is legislated to continue for up to six months.</p> \n<p>Eligible employees will receive from their employers a minimum of $1,500 per fortnight, before tax. Employers are able to top up the payment.</p> \n<h2>Will I receive $1,500 even if I ordinarily earn less?</h2> \n<p>If an employee ordinarily receives less than $1,500 in income per fortnight before tax, their employer must pay them, at a minimum, $1,500 per fortnight, before tax. It is therefore possible for a long-term casual or part-time worker to receive more than their ordinary pay.</p> \n<p>However, employers have gained new powers to change the ordinary hours, duties and location of work, meaning they may vary work to match the $1,500 payment. They cannot vary workers\u2019 ordinary rate of pay.</p> \n<h2>What if I was stood down or sacked?</h2> \n<p>If an employee has been stood down, their employer must pay their employee, at a minimum, $1,500 per fortnight, before tax.</p> \n<p>This means that employees of businesses that shut down due to various restrictions \u2013 such as cafes, restaurants, theatres, casino workers and the like \u2013 will continue to be paid even if they are not working.</p> \n<p>If an employee was employed on 1 March 2020, subsequently ceased employment with their employer, and then has been re-engaged by the same eligible employer, the employee will also receive, at a minimum, $1,500 per fortnight, before tax.</p> \n<p>Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said this payment \u201cchanges the equation\u201d and he expects employers who were forced to lay off workers may now \u201cput them back on the books\u201d.</p> \n<h2>When will it start being paid?</h2> \n<p>The subsidy will be backdated to start on 30 March, with the first payments to be received by employers in the first week of May.</p> \n<p>In the meantime, employers must pay their employees $1,500 fortnightly and then claim the money from the first week of May.</p> \n<p>Jobkeeper operates with a one-in all-in principle, meaning that once an employer decides to participate it must pay jobkeeper to all eligible employees who complete nomination forms.</p> \n<h2>What about superannuation?</h2> \n<p>Employers must continue to pay the superannuation guarantee on regular wages but it is up to employer whether they pay superannuation on additional jobkeeper payments.</p> \n<p>For example, a worker who ordinarily receives $1,000 a fortnight plus superannuation will receive the $1,500 jobkeeper payment, with superannuation paid on the first $1,000 and the employer able to decide whether to pay it on the last $500.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily coronavirus newsletter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download it</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Can I get the jobkeeper and other payments?</h2> \n<p>On 30 March, Scott Morrison said a person receiving the jobkeeper payment could not also receive the jobseeker payment (formerly Newstart).</p> \n<p>On 20 April, a spokesperson for the Department of Social Services clarified that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of people could not receive both payments because the $1,500 a fortnight jobkeeper payment \u201cexceeds the typical income limit for jobseeker which is $1,086.50\u201d.</p> \n<p>However, some people may qualify for both because jobkeeper counts as \u201cordinary income\u201d and there are categories of jobseeker recipients, such as single parents, with <a href=\"https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/services/centrelink/jobseeker-payment/how-much-you-can-get/income-and-asset-limits\">a higher income threshold</a>.</p> \n<p>People who have already applied for jobseeker can withdraw and shift to jobkeeper payments if they are re-engaged by their employer.</p> \n<p>A person cannot be in receipt of jobkeeper payments from two or more employers.</p> \n<h2>What about eligibility for jobseeker payments?</h2> \n<p>Eligibility has been expanded. Previously, Australians out of work were not eligible for the jobseeker payment if their partner earned $48,000 or more.</p> \n<p>However that has been changed and now people will be eligible for job-seeker payments unless their partner earns $79,762 or more.</p> \n<h2>Does this require legislation?</h2> \n<p>Yes. Parliament reconvened on 8 April with a smaller than usual sitting in Canberra <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/08/mps-pass-130bn-wage-subsidy-as-part-of-australias-road-out-of-coronavirus-crisis\">to pass the stimulus package</a>.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>Due to the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the coronavirus outbreak, this article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects the current situation at the date of publication.
