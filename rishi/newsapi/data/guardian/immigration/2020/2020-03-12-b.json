  "<p>I am writing to commend Zoe Williams for her thoughtful column (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/10/feminist-solidarity-empowers-everyone-the-movement-must-be-trans-inclusive\" title=\"\">Why we need feminist solidarity more than ever</a>, G2, 11 March).</p> <p>The trans \u201cdebate\u201d \u2013 a term I use loosely, as I don\u2019t believe trans people\u2019s rights should be up for debate \u2013 has focused largely on the voices of those decrying the right of trans women to be considered at all. As a cisgender woman, I am unequivocally supportive of the view that empowering trans women in no way disenfranchises or endangers cis women, and that in fact we are stronger united. The enemy is misogyny; our trans sisters are our allies in this fight, and history bears out their role in both this and in the equally important fight for LGBT+ liberation.</p> <p>I am wary of the proclamation that gender-critical feminists are \u201cbeing silenced\u201d; an argument as specious as the oft-repeated claim that \u201cwe can\u2019t talk about immigration\u201d. The claim that women are being silenced holds no water, not least when those allegedly doing the \u201csilencing\u201d are frequently also cisgender women (and many prolific \u201cgender-critical\u201d commentators are male). Women are not a monolith, and a great many of us welcome our trans sisters (and brothers) with open arms. I therefore wholeheartedly welcome Zoe Williams\u2019 measured view on this subject.<br><strong>Laura Mauro</strong><br><em>Basildon, Essex</em></p> <p>\u2022 At last an article about what I believe feminism to be, to be inclusive, to fight for the oppressed, to offer solidarity to all minorities. We must stop the infighting and join together, as together we are stronger \u2013 together we can change the world and eventually make everyone free to be themselves in safety. It is what being civilised is all about. Thank you, Zoe, for an article which says eloquently what I feel. <br><strong>Angela Price</strong><br><em>Dorchester, Dorset</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"http://gu.com/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s contorted spin on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/coronavirus-outbreak-us-trump-latest\">travel restrictions he announced</a> on Wednesday night, including pinning the blame for \u201ca foreign disease\u201d on the European Union, revealed a mind largely driven by politics and not science.</p> \n<p>The impression he sought to create was that the EU bureaucracy had let the world down by failing to take necessary steps to slow the spread of coronavirus, but the United Kingdom, legally outside the EU and physically an island, was exonerated.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days,\u201d the president said, specifically adding that these restrictions would not apply to the UK, without mentioning any other exemptions.</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s greatest friend in the UK, Nigel Farage, applauded the drastic but necessary measures. \u201cThe UK is now being treated as an independent country,\u201d he tweeted. The rewards of Brexit were already being reaped, in what looked like a big win for British diplomacy and the special relationship.</p> \n<p>But the reality, once the true details of the Presidential Proclamation were released, was somewhat different.</p> \n<p>The White House briefing paper said the US was closing its borders to foreign nationals who have been in the Schengen area in the last 14 days, which would apply to any British person who had recently been in the 26-nation visa-free area.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--showcase\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/02/interactive-coronavirus-trackers/europe\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Five other EU countries were also excluded from the US travel ban. So if the announcement was a big win for London\u2019s diplomatic heft, the same could be said of Bucharest, Nicosia, Zagreb, Dublin and Sofia, the capitals of five EU countries outside Schengen.</p> \n<p>The reality is that no European diplomat, including in the UK foreign office, had been forewarned that Trump, after a week of mishandling the crisis, was to put the EU in the dock in a bid to try to reinsert himself at the helm of the crisis.</p> \n<p>Many explanations have been offered for why Trump presented his announcement as he did. His prejudice against the EU is well known, and targeting Schengen countries gave him a chance to exempt the US\u2019s natural allies Ireland and the UK.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/trump-coronavirus-europe-travel-suspended\">Trump's EU coronavirus travel suspension explained: who is affected and will it help?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It may be that Trump has never heard of Schengen, Luxembourg or the Schengen free travel area. His spinners thought, rather than bamboozle an American public, and possibly the president, with the complexities of EU border areas, the neater impression should be left that the EU and not Brexit Britain was being targeted.</p> \n<p>An alternative explanation is that Trump had only cursorily acquainted himself with his own announcement, and misspoke. Elsewhere in his statement he twice said that goods from Europe would also be banned, a mistake that was hastily \u201cwalked back\u201d by his briefers.</p> \n<p>It may also be that the White House itself was not very convinced at the rationale of picking on the Schengen area for exclusion. The official explanation was the Schengen area had the largest number of coronavirus cases outside China. As of 12 March, the White House said the number of cases in the 26 Schengen countries was 17,442, with 711 deaths, and showed high continuous growth in infection areas. In total, Schengen countries had exported 201 cases to 53 countries.</p> \n<p>Moreover, the free flow of people between the Schengen countries made the task of preventing the coronavirus from spreading difficult, the White House said.</p> \n<p>This ignored the <a href=\"https://content.guardianapis.com/atom/interactive/interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\">large number of cases in the UK</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/coronavirus-white-house-trump-pence-testing\">lack of virus testing in the US</a> and the fact that some Schengen area countries, such as Poland and Denmark, had already effectively closed their borders to EU citizens.</p> \n<p>Ironically, the announcement represents a headache for the UK as its transport officials try to work out whether it will become a transit hub for Europeans seeking to reach the US.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Trump, after a week as a bystander, has put his imprimatur on the coronavirus crisis, and in a way that hammers UK shares. Larry Summers, the former chief economist at the World Bank, commented: \u201cThe president has set what I believe is a new world record for presidential market value destruction. He destroys about $500bn in equity market value in course of an 11-minute speech. Destruction roughly doubles as investors take an hour to analyse the speech. Loose lips sink ships. Imprudent rhetoric sinks markets.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump has form on politically motivated but arbitrary travel bans, notably on Muslims. In January 2017 he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/27/donald-trump-muslim-refugee-ban-executive-action\">barred people from seven majority-Muslim countries</a> \u2013 Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan and Libya \u2013 from entering the US for 90 days. The travel ban was later struck down as unconstitutional by the courts on the grounds that there was no rationale to have a ban that put religion at its heart. But this did not stop him from using the threat of a ban as a bargaining chip with Gulf states.</p> \n<p>In this latest ban, the guiding principle may not be religion, but animus towards an institution that challenges nationalism. Either way, the decision, and the manner in which it was taken, has left even British politicians appalled. Tom Tugendhat, the chair of the UK foreign affairs select committee, warned: \u201cHow countries work together in moments of crisis will shape how we cooperate after. This is a moment for the UK to reach out around the world to allies and friends to help coordinate action and support.\u201d</p> \n<p>The implicit criticism is that the US is not at present able to fulfil that role.</p>",
  "<p>Concerns are growing that the deportation of migrants from the US and Mexico could accelerate the spread of coronavirus in Central America, after authorities in Honduras suspended repatriation flights and confirmed the first two cases in the country.</p> <p>Honduras became the third country in Central America \u2013 and the first in the Northern Triangle region which is the largest source of migration to the US \u2013 to confirm cases of the virus late on Tuesday.</p> <p>The cases both involved people who had recently returned from Europe, but three men deported from the US also arrived presenting symptoms of the virus.</p> <p>The three deportees \u2013 aged between 18 and 26 \u2013 have been placed in isolation, and President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez called for calm, saying on Wednesday: \u201cWe cannot allow ourselves to be guided by panic or hysteria.\u201d</p> <p>But activists fear that the constant flow of deportees from the US and Mexico could complicate the region\u2019s ability to contain the virus. More than 1,000 cases and 38 deaths from the virus have been confirmed in the US.</p> <p>\u201cThose countries need to be reviewing a moratorium on deportations right now in light of this illness,\u201d said Elizabeth Kennedy, a migration expert based in Central America.</p> <p>So far, Central America has just one death \u2013 in Panama \u2013 and a handful of confirmed cases in Panama, Costa Rica and now Honduras.</p> <p>But the pandemic reaches the region just as Honduras and El Salvador were due to follow Guatemala and implement \u201csafe third country\u201d agreements with Washington, under which migrants seeking asylum at the US border will instead be diverted to Central America.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/coronavirus-outbreak-us-immigration-centers\">Coronavirus inevitable in prison-like US immigration centers, doctors say</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Health workers have warned that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/coronavirus-outbreak-us-immigration-centers\">the virus will inevitably find a foothold in US immigration detention centers</a> where overcrowding and limited healthcare are endemic.</p> <p>Meanwhile the grueling journey north leaves migrants particularly vulnerable. Lack of food, sleep and constant stress lead to fatigue and weakened immune defenses, said Karen Valladares, director of the migrant rights group Fonamih in Honduras.</p> <p>\u201cOn their journey migrants are more susceptible \u2013 not only to coronavirus \u2013 but also other illnesses,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The lack of access to medical care and close quarters at migrant shelters, camps and detention centers further exacerbates the risk. Migrant rights organizations have also recommended against traveling in caravans to avoid infection.</p> <p>With no sign that the US and Mexico plan to suspend deportations, experts called for increased medical screenings before migrants are placed on planes or buses \u2013 the most common form of transportation for Mexican deportations.</p> <p>\u201cBefore there is a return, there must be an evaluation,\u201d said Valladares. \u201cOne person can infect the 99 others that are in the bus.\u201d</p> <p>Exposing migrants to the virus would not only be negligent, but also a violation of their rights, she added.</p> <p>Meanwhile Guatemala <a href=\"https://www.elheraldo.hn/mundo/1362697-466/guatemala-impedir%C3%A1-ingreso-a-nueva-caravana-migrante-teme-contagio-de-coronavirus\">announced new measures to control migrant flows heading northwards</a>, on the grounds that it was seeking to stop the spread of coronavirus.</p> <p>After a relatively small caravan left the Honduran city of San Pedro Sula on Monday, Guatemala\u2019s president, Alejandro Giammattei, said the migrants would be stopped at the border. \u201cEveryone will have their temperature taken and any person who has [coronavirus] symptoms will not be let in.\u201d</p> <p>The president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, took a more dramatic approach, announcing on Wednesday a \u201cnational quarantine\u201d, closing schools for 21 days and a ban on entry to the country for any foreign nationals who are not residents or diplomats.</p> <p>Analysts say temporary restrictions \u2013 and the fear of crowded public spaces \u2013 may cause a drop in migration northwards. But the long-term economic impact of the crisis could lead to a reduction in remittances from the US, and an increase in unemployment in the region, forcing more people to head north out of economic desperation.</p>",

Back to the Future (1985)</h2> <p>The Freudian themes might make it less comforting than other films here, but Marty McFly\u2019s time-travel adventures in the small-town America of his parents\u2019 youth is always reassuring.</p> <h2>19.

A morality tale that is weirdly calming and pacifying.</p> <h2>18.

Dreamgirls (2006)</h2> <p>Jamie Foxx, Beyonc\u00e9, Jennifer Hudson and Danny Glover in this outrageously calorific double-helping of music and romance, all about the Detroit music scene from the 60s and 70s.</p> <h2>15. Love &amp; Basketball (2000)</h2> <p>Here to prove that sports movies can be as comforting as romances, and that they can moreover be romances, is Gina Prince-Bythewood\u2019s Love &amp; Basketball. Omar Epps and Sanaa Lathan star as the boy and girl next door who are both fiercely good at basketball, and pretty competitive, and perhaps not yet ready to confess how into each other they are. It\u2019s a very seductive love story with some sharp commentary on sexism on the basketball court.</p> <h2>14. Jupiter Ascending (2015)</h2> <p>This supremely wacky and world-historically daft sci-fi extravaganza is just what you need to cheer you up, featuring as it does an outrageous scene-stealing turn from Eddie Redmayne, playing the scheming space-lord Balem, an epicene pharaoh of intergalactic evilness. He completely upstages the film\u2019s notional leads Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis who encounter the vampirically arrogant alien clan \u2013 led by Redmayne. It really is wildly silly but very funny.</p> <h2>13. Mary Poppins (1964)</h2> <p>When you want cinema itself to be your nanny, dispensing wisdom and comfort, here is the Julie Andrews classic, cheering you up, spit-spot.</p> <h2>12. Ferris Bueller\u2019s Day Off (1986)</h2> <p>A wonderfully comforting movie that celebrates the world of idling, skiving, goofing off, and what the French flaneurs called \u201c<a href=\"https://hybridflaneur.wordpress.com/2015/03/05/the-metaphor-in-flaneur-botanizing/\" title=\"\">botanising on the asphalt</a>\u201d. Matthew Broderick plays a high-school kid from Chicago\u2019s North Shore called Ferris Bueller who fakes an illness so he can award himself a personal day in the city with his girlfriend and his best friend, who will be bringing his dad\u2019s treasured Ferrari. The movie bops around the city from joyous set-piece to joyous set-piece and some words from Ferris about how life goes by so fast that you have to make sure you appreciate it.</p> <h2>11. Clueless (1995)</h2> <p>The greatest Jane Austen adaptation in film history is also as richly comforting as drinking a mug of milky tea while curled up on the couch, eating a family-sized tub of Celebrations swathed in a cashmere slanket. Alicia Silverstone is glorious as Cher (the Emma of her day) who is happy, pretty and extremely well-meaning, with a great love of the mall, and an altruistic need to fix other people\u2019s love lives. She achieves a strange kind of intimacy with her stepbrother Josh, an earnest college kid home for the vacation, played by Paul Rudd, and they hang out in the kitchen or huddled up watching TV \u2013 and realise that have feelings for each other.</p> <h2>10. The Pursuit of Happyness (2006)</h2> <p>Unashamed and unabashed at all times, this is an industrial-strength Hollywood heartwarmer that lets you have the feelgood monosodium-glutamate right in your veins. Will Smith stars in this based-on-a-true-story of an ordinary guy who suffered heartbreak and homelessness as a single dad, and gets offered a once-in-a-lifetime shot out of poverty: an unpaid internship at a top financial firm. But he has to keep up appearances in front of all the other entitled Ivy Leaguers while covering up the fact that he is sleeping in a homeless shelter at night.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52x5HJ9H8DM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/52x5HJ9H8DM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>9. Paddington 2 (2017)</h2> <p>At a time when all of us feel like nothing more than self-isolating and eating marmalade direct from the jar, here is one of the most profoundly comforting comedies of recent times, which incidentally shows how a confident nation is happy about immigrants. Hugh Grant gives what many believe to be the finest performance of his career as the peevish, cravat-wearing actor Phoenix Buchanan who steals a precious pop-up book with clues to hidden treasure from Mr Gruber\u2019s shop \u2013 and frames Paddington for the crime. Despite doing jail time, the bear comes bouncing back.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzCx8bMMTOM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TzCx8bMMTOM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>8. Galaxy Quest (1999)</h2> <p>All together now: \u201cBy Grabthar\u2019s hammer, by the Sons of Warvan, you shall be avenged!\u201d Alan Rickman had a glorious role in this brilliant postmodern sci-fi comedy as Alexander Dane, the grumpy British thesp who had his moment of fame playing Dr Lazarus on a cancelled TV show called <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0177789/\" title=\"\">Galaxy Quest</a> and now, like the rest of the jaded cast (including Sigourney Weaver and Tim Allen), makes a living going round fan conventions, signing photos and reciting the catchphrases to the tragic nerdy fans. But then a deputation from outer space arrives believing the show to be a documentary history of what actually happened, and desperately needing our heroes\u2019 help. Galaxy Quest has one of the cleverest, funniest plot premises in film history, worked out to perfection.</p> <h2>7. The Princess Bride (1987)</h2> <p>William Goldman, who adapted this movie from his own novel, became famous for his screenwriting axiom: \u201cNobody knows anything.\u201d But we certainly know that this film is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/nov/09/favourite-film-princess-bride\" title=\"\">absolutely great</a>: sweet, charming, funny, with a dash of idealism and a genuine eccentricity that distinguishes it from regular Hollywood product. Cary Elwes plays the handsome farmhand who falls in love with a beautiful noblewoman played by Robin Wright. Their love is sabotaged by evil court plotters but the lovers find friendship with the passionate, hot-headed Spanish swordsman Montoya, played by Mandy Patinkin. Great to watch with all the family, or the grownups can savour it all on their own.</p> <h2>6. Notting Hill (1999)</h2> <p>This inspirationally glutinous fantasy from screenwriter Richard Curtis is about what would happen if an ordinary civilian bloke (and a Brit, to boot) fell for a super-glamorous Hollywood star, and she with him. The bloke is the tousle-haired stammerer Hugh Grant (making his second appearance on this list) and the star is Julia Roberts, who had what some of us believe to be her greatest career moment in Notting Hill, and the scene when she tearfully tells him that she\u2019s just a girl standing in front of a boy is a classic. Rhys Ifans found stardom as Hugh\u2019s appalling flatmate Spike who says: \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you a story that will make your balls shrink to the size of raisins\u201d, which incidentally is what happens to the male audience when the arrogant star, played by Alec Baldwin, dismisses poor Hugh from the hotel where he had been hoping to have sex with Julia. But it all ends happily.</p> <h2>5. Duck Soup (1933)</h2> <p>A brilliant and rather prescient satire on 1930s nationalism and indeed fascism, but also a hilarious comedy. The bizarre Ruritanian state of Freedonia, in deepest central Europe, is enduring a continuous and worsening economic crisis and forever on the verge of war with its equally belligerent neighbour Sylvania. But a rescue plan is at hand. A wealthy American widow (played in magnificent deadpan by Margaret Dumont) offers a multimillion dollar loan to Freedonia\u2019s coffers on condition that they install her close friend as president \u2013 and that is the free-thinking visionary and genius, Rufus T Firefly, played by Groucho Marx. Wisecracking Rufus soon causes mayhem in Freedonia\u2019s quasi-fascist staterooms. Is this the US\u2019s quasi-colonialism in action?</p> <h2>4. It\u2019s Complicated (2009)</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/11/nancy-meyers-focusing-on-my-movie-kitchens-is-sexist-director-its-complicated\" title=\"\">Nancy Meyers</a> is the Michelin-starred chef of cinematic comfort cuisine and here she serves up a richly flavoured dish of escapist storytelling, a veritable festival of gastro-lifestyle porn featuring very rich people who don\u2019t particularly regard themselves as rich. Meryl Streep is the divorced woman with grown-up kids who is now a \u201cchocolatier\u201d, of all the outrageously implausible things, running an upscale deli-cum-eaterie, although the actual work involved is minimal. Her roguish lawyer ex-husband, played by Alec Baldwin, broke her heart by running off with a hard-faced younger woman who is now failing to satisfy him on the life-affirming laughter front, so he starts having an affair with his ex-wife. You really do need to suspend your disbelief in this world of almost weightless freedom from work and ordinary money worries, but it is undeniably enjoyable and comforting in its weird way.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHfRyFyuDKM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sHfRyFyuDKM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>3. Waiting to Exhale (1995)</h2> <p>Waiting to Exhale is basically the equivalent to eating an entire Haagen Dazs tub of ice-cream while watching the greatest daytime soap opera of all time \u2013 and it is tremendously addictive. Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine and Lela Rochon play four smart, successful women who are discontented with the men in their lives \u2013 and the way society somehow finds that a woman\u2019s inability to be in a relationship with a man makes their other accomplishments somehow second-rate. But these discontents are showcased in a horribly watchable world of nice clothes and nice cars. It also has a great male cast, including Wendell Pierce, later to be Bunk in The Wire and Willy Loman in Death of a Salesman on the London stage.</p> <h2>2. The Devil Wears Prada (2006)</h2> <p>Meryl Streep makes her second appearance on this list in this fashion comedy movie based on the Lauren Weisberger novel, reportedly inspired by the terrifying fashion empress Anna Wintour. It is a comedy, but without the sharp, angular edges of satire or bleakness that might endanger the comfort factor. New York City is replete with glamour and gorgeousness as the location for this aspirational story: Anne Hathaway is the callow literature graduate from the sticks who somehow flukes a job at the colossally prestigious fashion magazine Runway edited by Streep\u2019s terrifying Miranda Priestly, the boss from hell who enforces a Stockholm-Syndrome love on all her employees and on us, the audience. Stanley Tucci is wonderful as her long-serving, long-suffering senior executive and this was the film that launched the elegant Emily Blunt on the world, as the super-snobbish fashionista who is to be Hathaway\u2019s unwilling guide.</p> <h2>1. Titanic (1997)</h2> <p>There can surely be no doubt as to the No 1 slot. As Liam Neeson says in Love Actually: \u201cWe need Kate and we need Leo and we need them now.\u201d Cheesy it may be, but this film delivers weapons-grade feelgood \u2013 and, at well over three hours, it delivers an awful lot of it. Because, paradoxically, nothing says filmic comfort eating like screaming in terror and being plunged into the icy Atlantic ocean, resurfacing, discovering that for some reason the woman you are in love with somehow can\u2019t scooch up on her bit of driftwood to let you on, and then going back down again, with C\u00e9line Dion in the background singing that her heart will go on. Kate Winslet found her moment of global greatness as Rose, the young well-born passenger in first class who is unhappily engaged to creepy Billy Zane (fated not to cover himself with glory once the trouble starts). Rose finds that she has a distinct spark with Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s Jack who has won his third-class ticket in a poker game and thinks himself the luckiest young fellow in the world to have got on board for this exciting maiden voyage \u2013 especially when he feels that Rose is in love with him, and secretly gets to paint her in the nude. (That\u2019s her in the nude, not him.) It is amazing to think that just before this film was released, all the talk was about how it could be a disaster \u2013 how it was going to be like Lew Grade\u2019s Raise the Titanic; what a tyrannical monster Cameron was to his cast etc \u2013 but the film\u2019s instant rip-roaring success simply blew all this away. A film to lull you into a bovine stupor of wellbeing.</p>",

  "<p>Such is the reverse Midas touch of Donald Trump, that his attempt last night to face facts, steady nerves and reassure the public succeeded in spreading panic, sowing confusion and ratcheting up the anxiety.</p> <p>The fact that Trump delivered a rare, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/mar/12/trump-announces-travel-ban-from-europe-to-the-us-in-bid-to-stem-coronavirus-video\" title=\"\">live televised address</a> to the nation should, by itself, have induced calm.

(As recently as Tuesday, he was saying, \u201cIt will go away, just stay calm.\u201d) That he was ready to deploy one of the US presidency\u2019s most powerful tools, usually reserved for moments of war or disaster \u2013 a TV address from the Oval Office \u2013 seemed to signal that he was, at last, facing reality.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/12/us-cities-wuhan-coronavirus-covid-19\">Will American cities have a Wuhan experience? Only if they are lucky | Dr Renee C Wurth and Dr Nick Obradovich</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sure enough, when he referred to the virus as a \u201chorrible infection\u201d, after weeks spent dismissing it as a glorified cold or flu, it fed the hope that Trump might finally be ready to acknowledge that his approach up until this moment had not worked \u2013 that this was not a problem that could be dealt with in the usual away, swatted aside with a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/08/us/politics/trump-coronavirus.html\" title=\"\">tweet</a> or by hanging a comic nickname around the neck of one of his enemies.</p> <p>But no sooner had that hope appeared than it faded away. For in the course of nine minutes, Trump swiftly reverted to type. He described Covid-19 as a \u201cforeign virus\u201d, and took pains to point out that \u201ca large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travellers from Europe\u201d. His doctrine of \u201cAmerica first\u201d \u2013 a phrase he used once again \u2013 forever pits the US against the world, with its implication that America\u2019s purity is permanently under threat of contamination by alien hordes. Trump has used that imagery in the context of immigration for more than four years; it should hardly be a surprise that he uses it now in the context of disease.</p> <p>Equally in character was his preference for the vast, sweeping edict over the detailed, calibrated policy response. What the US needs most is a serious, extensive programme of testing. Currently, the US is bottom of the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StewartWood/status/1238015271346020352?s=20\" title=\"\">global league</a> table for coronavirus testing, at a rate of just five people in every million. (South Korea is testing 3,692 people per million.) But that kind of announcement would require too much work, not least because Trump shut down the dedicated Obama-era, White House unit that had focused on preparedness against a global pandemic. It would be too dull and plodding for the man who made his name issuing orders on The Apprentice. Trump prefers the kingly diktat that makes instant headlines and good TV. In the 2016 campaign it was his call for a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/07/donald-trump-ban-all-muslims-entering-us-san-bernardino-shooting\" title=\"\">total and complete shutdown</a>\u201d on Muslims entering the US. This time it was a ban on travellers from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/trump-coronavirus-europe-travel-suspended\" title=\"\">26 European countries</a> in the Schengen area, starting on Friday. Once again, the would-be medieval monarch was ordering the drawbridge pulled up against the foreign menace.</p> <p>He surely hoped his subjects would be soothed by such a decisive show of leadership. But because this is Trump, his short speech was riddled with errors that had to be rapidly corrected \u2013 thereby spreading confusion rather than clarity. One example: he announced that his Europe ban would \u201capply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo\u201d across the Atlantic, prompting the White House to rush out a statement explaining that the president had got it wrong, and that the new policy would, in fact, only apply to people, not goods. If the plan was to project a White House coolly capable in the face of a crisis, that mix-up and Trump\u2019s halting discomfort in front of the teleprompter conveyed the precise opposite.</p> <p>Above all, the new policy lacked rhyme or reason. Why keep out almost all Europeans, as if this problem is exclusive to Europe (and China), rather than global, and when the US has a rising infection problem all its own? And why exempt the UK, which is hardly coronavirus-free? There was no explanation, so speculation filled the vacuum. Could it be a politically motivated swipe at the EU, which Trump once said he regarded as the US\u2019s greatest \u201cfoe\u201d, pointedly giving preferential treatment to Brexit Britain? Was it driven by a motive as base as the fact that Trump has <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/trumps-travel-ban-sidesteps-his-own-european-resorts/\" title=\"\">golf courses in the UK</a> (and Ireland), and he didn\u2019t want to harm his own businesses? Or did it spring from a crudely racist worldview that divides the globe into a clean, acceptable Anglosphere set against a tainted, diseased \u201cabroad\u201d?</p> <p>Whatever the explanation, the address did not work. The clearest proof came in the metric Trump understands best and that terrifies him most, because he believes it holds the key to his prospects of re-election.

Pence said that health insurance companies \u201care working with us\u201d to cover treatment, while confirming that at present they have only waived the cost of being tested for the virus.</p> <p>Pence\u2019s answer on treatment differed from what Trump <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/11/politics/read-trump-coronavirus-address/index.html\">said</a> on Wednesday night during his presidential address on coronavirus. Trump said leaders of the health insurance industry \u201chave agreed to waive all co-payments for coronavirus treatments, extend insurance coverage to these treatments and to prevent surprise medical billing\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile, on NBC\u2019s Today Show, Pence confirmed that coronavirus is deadlier than the seasonal flu.

  "<p>Have you ever watched a waiter take a dover sole off the bone? It requires an extremely steady hand and ocean-like depths of confidence to slip the knife along the back of a hyper-expensive fish and slip the fillets away from each other while being watched by the person who paid for it. Have you seen a waiter take the orders of a table of eight and then make sure, without asking again, that everybody is served the dishes they ordered across multiple courses? And then deal with the obstreperous, foul-mouthed drunk in the corner, without disturbing anyone else? Have you watched a restaurant cook fulfil a dozen grill orders at the same time, without losing track of any individual preferences, while their colleague whips up souffle after souffle?</p> <p>These are the skills which make the pleasure of a meal in a restaurant what it is. Unless, of course, you are the British government in general and the home secretary in particular. Under the new points-based immigration rules <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/18/uk-to-close-door-to-non-english-speakers-and-unskilled-workers\" title=\"\">announced last month</a> and due to come into force next January, most jobs in the hospitality industry are simply dismissed as unskilled labour.

But that will merely be met with a shout of: \u201cWe\u2019ve left; get over it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>How many of us are genuinely confident that Boris Johnson could safely get our lunch from kitchen to table?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Fair enough. But we must surely be able to give a damn about the way we describe people and the work they do for us? Certain professions \u2013 nursing, civil engineering, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-k-shortage-occupation-list\" title=\"\">the most senior of chefs with very detailed restrictions</a> \u2013 are denoted \u201cspecific shortage occupations\u201d for which the rules can be waived if necessary. The majority of hospitality is not one of those professions. Chef Selin Kiazim of Oklava has started a petition against the changes. As she has said in an open message to the home secretary: \u201cWe bake your bread, we cook your dinner, we serve your wine \u2026 we are more than just a random number of points.\u201d Or as Asma Khan of Darjeeling Express put it in an Instagram post: \u2018I am inviting Boris [Johnson] to come serve in my restaurant and then we can have a discussion on whether low skills is a threshold for hospitality.\u201d How many of us are genuinely confident that Johnson could safely get our lunch from kitchen to table?</p> <p>These rules will have an impact. For example, more than a third of people working in hospitality and catering in London are EU nationals, and 80% of them would not be eligible to work here under the new rules. Who will fill those vacancies? <a href=\"https://www.bighospitality.co.uk/Article/2020/02/25/D-D-London-s-chairman-and-CEO-Des-Gunewardena-on-how-restaurants-will-have-to-adapt-post-Brexit\" title=\"\">Des Gunewardena</a>, CEO of restaurant group D&amp;D, has described it as a \u201cbody blow\u201d for the industry.</p> <p>What\u2019s most infuriating about the rules is the way they institutionalise snobbery. It\u2019s a sneering, grossly ignorant failure to understand what it takes to do so many of the jobs that make our lives so much more pleasant. Just as with personal care work, which requires huge reserves of patience, empathy and, yes, skill, jobs in hospitality are often terribly underpaid. But a person\u2019s value is so much more than the size of their pay packet. These immigration rules don\u2019t merely threaten the hospitality industry. They undermine the way we treat and judge people. Surely, as a nation, we\u2019re better than this?</p>",
  "<p>\u201cCivilisation is in crisis,\u201d warned the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/17/how-diet-latest-front-culture-wars-eat-less-meat-lancet\" title=\"\">EAT-Lancet international commission</a> of food scientists last year. \u201cWe can no longer feed our population a healthy diet while balancing planetary resources. For the first time in 200,000 years of human history, we are severely out of synchronisation with the planet and nature.\u201d We face climate crisis, ecological destruction, record obesity rates and rising hunger: food is threatening our future.</p> <p>Carolyn Steel recognises these challenges, but she also sees food as \u201cby far the most powerful medium available to us for thinking and acting together to change the world for the better\u201d. By reconfiguring our relationship with food, she argues, we can find new and better ways of living that will arrest the damage we are doing to ourselves and the Earth.</p> <p>Our world, Steel writes, is a \u201cSitopia\u201d, a \u201cfood place\u201d \u2013 from the Greek words <em>sitos</em> and <em>topos</em> \u2013 where everything from our environment to our societies to our bodies has been affected by our relationship with food, which \u201cpreceded us, anticipates us, sustains us\u201d. It shapes our lives, but since its influence is so pervasive, we often fail to notice it. Thinking about its realities can also make us uncomfortable. We don\u2019t want to know about the vast cruelty of industrialised meat and dairy production, the exploitation of migrant labourers, the deforestation and drought that are eating into the landscape of the global south, or how our addiction to processed foods is making us fat and ill.</p> <p>The toxic core of our current conundrum is the lack of value we place on food. \u201cCheap food is an oxymoron,\u201d Steel argues \u2013 low supermarket prices hide the costs of pollution, ecological destruction, poverty and obesity. She calls for a revelation of the true cost of food that will make industrial agriculture unaffordable and invigorate ecologically produced organic food, creating a \u201cvirtuous cycle\u201d in which \u201cthe market would favour foods that nurtured nature, animals and people\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5cd4a701fa1cc344b09c92947bc1110b09aac7d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5cd4a701fa1cc344b09c92947bc1110b09aac7d6/0_0_1464_2000/732.jpg\" alt=\"A man works on his land in the mountains overlooking the Mondragon Cooperative.\" width=\"732\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man works on his land in the mountains overlooking the Mondragon Cooperative.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Dimis/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Steel\u2019s range is vast and the book\u2019s breadth of subjects reinforces her conception that food influences everything, and that our troubled modern relationship with it reflects deeper existential problems. She argues that a loss of culinary heritage has created \u201ca deep confusion about what and how to eat\u201d. At times, this can drift into excessive nostalgia for the traditional (\u201cif you want to eat bhel puri and aloo tikki the traditional way, you had better get yourself off to India quick\u201d) or a lost past: \u201cwhile life in a pre-industrial household was tough\u201d, she writes, \u201cit had qualities that modern life also lacks: a clear sense of purpose and belonging\u201d.</p> <p>But she is well aware of the long history of anxieties over how we should eat and live, and moves skilfully through the answers offered by Greek Stoics, Enlightenment philosophers, clean-living crusaders and many in between. By moving away from asking ourselves such questions \u2013 \u201cWe don\u2019t have time for that!\u201d an exasperated businessman told Steel \u2013 we have forgotten where value really lies. A new \u201cSitopian contract\u201d would \u201cestablish the right of every human and non-human to eat well\u201d.</p> <p>Such shifts would require enormous change and Steel sketches a \u201cSitopian economics\u201d that would put food and its intrinsic value at the heart of economic life. In the slow food movement, \u201cslow money\u201d social investing and \u201cguerrilla localism\u201d, she sees the roots of new and democratic ways of reorganising commerce for a society whose new golden rule would be \u201cFeed thy neighbour as thyself\u201d. This radical revolution is unlikely to come from government, and anarchism\u2019s time, Steel writes, has arguably come. While truly anarchist societies would be \u201cnear-impossible to build or sustain\u201d, Steel feels its core message is perfect for an age squeezed by \u201cthe fatal duality of neoliberalism and totalitarianism\u201d. She draws inspiration from Peter Kropotkin and Pierre\u2011Joseph Proudhon in their desire for a third form of society between communism and capitalism, in which communities are freed from excesses of property and authority.</p> <p>Wealth taxes \u2013 \u201cIt is not necessary to confiscate land,\u201d Henry George wrote, \u201conly to confiscate rent\u201d \u2013 would \u201cre-establish the land as the true source of our common wealth\u201d, Steel believes, diminishing the value of property in ways that would free urban and rural communities to create vibrant and innovative new ways of living together. She highlights the Beddington Zero Energy Development (BedZED), vertical urban farms, the \u201cPreston model\u201d of urban regeneration, and the Basque country\u2019s Mondragon cooperatives: alternatives are possible.</p> <p>Steel is an architect by trade and training, and her expertise shines on the urban environment. Her previous book, <em>Hungry City</em>, explored how our vast conurbations feed themselves, and here she traces food\u2019s role in urban development from Sumerian Uruk to Renaissance Siena, industrial Chicago to postwar garden cities. Urban planning, she argues, is one of our most urgent tasks \u2013 to replace the wild sprawl of megacities with more considered urban forms that rethink how we can create socially and environmentally sustainable cities. She imagines city and country brought into harmony, with urban and rural dwellers enjoying commonly owned forest gardens and wild farms.</p> <p>She wonders if \u201csuch a vision is hopelessly utopian\u201d, and indeed it is hard to see how such change could be extended to the societies of totalitarian China and rapidly indutrialising India, to the conflict-ridden Middle East, or to the diversity of Africa. Certainly doing so would require culturally specific considerations of the way food intersects with inequality, race and power. In the age of Trump and Brexit, Putin and Bolsonaro, it is difficult to see how food-focused anarchism can help us create \u201ca new stratum of global governance, a polycentric network of nested local groups and international bodies based on the shared management of common resources\u201d.</p> <p>Utopian thinking, however, is by its very nature unrealistic by the standards of the world it seeks to transform. It is the industrialism and imperialism of the west that created many of today\u2019s crises, Steel argues, so it is the west\u2019s collective duty to explore alternative models of what she calls \u201csocial maturity\u201d. The deepest message of this ambitious book is a philosophical one, a vital call for us to rediscover the way that food binds us to each other and to the natural world, and in doing so find new ways of living.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Christopher Kissane\u2019s Food, Religion &amp; Communities in Early Modern Europe is published by Bloomsbury.

  "<p>It is not going to be the joyful occasion they first thought, but the Lask players are determined to make history regardless.

It is a blow to the players, the fans and the club\u2019s finances \u2013 the president, Siegmund Gruber, says the club will lose an estimated \u20ac1m (\u00a3870,000) in revenues \u2013 with the captain, Gernot Trauner, calling it \u201ca middle-sized catastrophe\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/11/europa-league-coronavirus-wolves-manchester-united-inter-milan-sevilla\">Europa League thrown into coronavirus chaos as two last-16 ties are shelved</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trauner, however, also pointed out that a lack of fans in the stadium does not mean that the players will be less motivated. It is still a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for many of them to reach the last eight of a European competition and they have shown in recent years that they are capable of achieving the unexpected.</p> <p>It is fair to say that the recent rise of Lask has largely gone unnoticed outside Austria and after the draw Gary Lineker tweeted: \u201cWho the hell are Lask by the way? Don\u2019t worry I Lask someone.\u201d It was said tongue in cheek, with a smiling emoji next to it, and one of the club\u2019s sponsors responded to the tweet by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHU0V9Zz_ek\">remaking an advert for the club</a> to include the line, \u201cThe Red Devils? Never heard of \u2019em\u201d.</p> <p>The Lask manager, Val\u00e9rien Isma\u00ebl, however, refused to get caught up in it all. When asked about Lineker\u2019s tweet, he simply said: \u201cI don\u2019t care about that because I know what we have got [quality-wise] and what we can do. The truth can always be found on the pitch.\u201d</p> <p>Isma\u00ebl has a point but sometimes the truth can be found off the pitch too, as Lask fans know only too well. As late as 2013 the club were on the brink of going out of business with the managing director, Gerhard Klein, admitting in October that year that \u201cthe lights can go out soon\u201d.</p> <p>In 2012 they had not been able to renew their licence to play in the top two divisions and had dropped down to the third tier. During the 2013-14 season they moved away from their home stadium because it was too expensive to play there. The finances were in a terrible state and the club were desperately trying to find a buyer. \u201cThe best solution would be to find a local solution,\u201d Klein said, \u201cand if we can find that then maybe the ice age of Lask Linz is finally over.\u201d</p> <p>Two months later they struck a deal with a group of local investors called \u201cFreunde des Lask\u201d (Friends of Lask) to take over the club with Wolf-Dieter Holzhey becoming the new president. Fourteen \u201cfriends\u201d initially committed to put in \u20ac75,000 each, guarantee another \u20ac75,000 and raise \u20ac50,000 in sponsorship money.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d325036e989badac88229a51b691ec05478370c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d325036e989badac88229a51b691ec05478370c3/0_60_3200_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Valerien Ismael\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Valeri\u00e9n Isma\u00ebl, the Lask manager. \u2018 know what we have got and what we can do,\u2019 he says.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Bruna/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The results have been remarkable.

  "<p>As night fell on 26 March 2019, two small boats made their way north across the Mediterranean. The rubber crafts were flimsy; it would be nearly impossible for those onboard to make it to Europe without help. From the north, a twin-propeller aeroplane from the European Union naval force approached. From the south, the coastguard from the country they had just fled, Libya, was coming.</p> \n<p>The aircraft arrived first but there would be no rescue from Europe. Instead the flight, callsign Seagull 75, radioed the Libyans telling them where to find the boats. But Libya\u2019s would-be interceptors would need more than just the coordinates. \u201cOK sir, my radar is not good, is not good, if you stay [over the boat] I will follow you,\u201d said the coastguard, according to recordings of VHF marine radio picked up by a nearby ship.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"2e3eadd7-97b1-4a72-9b61-4e3bf8c9ee39\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Seagull 75 circled overhead.

While the level of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/06/refugees-europe-closed-tensions-greece-turkey-border\">violence at Greece\u2019s border with Turkey</a> has shocked many Europeans, Europe\u2019s retreat from refugee rights did not begin last week. Greece\u2019s decision to seal its borders and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-syria-security-greece-un/u-n-says-greece-has-no-right-to-stop-accepting-asylum-requests-idUSKBN20P2BH\">deny access to asylum</a> is only the most visible escalation of an assault on people\u2019s right to seek protection.</p> \n<p>The groundwork for this was laid in the central Mediterranean, where the EU and Italy created a proxy force to do what they could not do themselves without openly violating international laws: intercept unwanted migrants and return them to Libya.</p> \n<p>The strategy has relied on maintaining deniability of responsibility for Libyan coastguard operations. But the connivance revealed in the audio recordings is supported by previously unpublished letters between high-level EU mandarins, confirmed by inside sources and laid bare in emails from the Libyan coastguard, all obtained by the Guardian. Taken together, this evidence threatens to unravel a conspiracy in the Mediterranean that flouts international law in the name of migration control.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"44aecd53cc581e533d55c3bd29e225bd71d4fd89\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44aecd53cc581e533d55c3bd29e225bd71d4fd89/0_0_4928_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People wait to be rescued as they drift in the Mediterranean off the coast of Libya\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People wait to be rescued as they drift in the Mediterranean off the coast of Libya, October 2016.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The Mediterranean is the theatre where tensions between Europe\u2019s ideas of human rights do battle with continental politicians\u2019 anxiety about African migration. Until 2009, Libya was a \u201csafe\u201d country of return because countries such as Italy said it was. Italian vessels would intercept migrants and persuade them to clamber off their boats with promises of passage to Italy, and then put them in handcuffs and sail them to Tripoli.</p> \n<p>Italy shipped close to 900 people back to Libya in 2009. Among those returnees were 11 Eritreans and Somalis who complained to the European court of human rights. The court\u2019s ruling in 2012 said Italy was guilty of refoulement and had violated the men\u2019s right to claim asylum and not to be returned to an unsafe port. In rejecting Italy\u2019s arguments, one of the judges pointed out that \u201crefugees have the right to have rights.\u201d</p> \n<p>This ruling, named the <a href=\"https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#%7B%22itemid%22:%5B%22001-109231%22%5D%7D\">Hirsi ruling</a> after one of the returnees, means any refoulement operation, even one carried out by a proxy force, would be vulnerable to international legal scrutiny if an<strong> </strong>EU state could be shown to be controlling and directing these operations. Europe had to find allies in Libya who were capable of intercepting migrants on the high seas without overt direction from the Europeans.</p> \n<p>The project of building a proxy took off in the summer of 2017. At that time Libya, in the middle of a civil war, had no centralised coastguard and no capacity to manage its own search and rescue area. From the outset it was a joint project between Rome and Brussels: Italy provided ships while the EU trained and paid the new coastguards, often <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/N1711623.pdf\">recruiting from among militias</a> and smugglers.</p> \n<p>To bolster the legitimacy of the new coastguard, <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/P-8-2018-003665_EN.html\">paperwork needed to be lodged</a> with the International Maritime Organization declaring that Libya now managed its own search and rescue zone. Court documents from a case in Catania, Sicily, would later show that one of the first telephone numbers listed for the coastguard was an Italian number.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/this-is-europe-nugget-zip/giv-3902djciTE7YISlG/\" data-alt=\"newsletter\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/this-is-europe-nugget-zip/giv-3902djciTE7YISlG/\">newsletter</a> \n</figure> \n<p>But European money and material would not be enough to create an effective interception force. The former militiamen and smugglers who were now in coastguard uniforms struggled to reduce crossings. According to leaked internal documents from Operation Sophia from 2018, after more than a year of training and financial support the Libyan coastguard was still unable to control its own search and rescue area. To stop more crossings to Europe, they were going to need even more help.</p> \n<p>From 2017 the EU began extending surveillance flights over the zone. Two years later, flights by the EU border agency Frontex almost doubled the size of the EU aerial mission. Under the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/unclos_e.pdf\">law of the sea</a> its pilots were bound to contact whichever ship was best placed to assist any boats in distress. But as the Libyans began asserting their presence in the Mediterranean, European flights and their coordinators started giving preference to ships that would take those they rescued southwards, despite the fact that European courts, the UN\u2019s refugee and migration agencies all agree Libya is <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/libya/unhcr-update-libya-16-august-2019-enar\">not a safe country</a>.</p> \n<p>Potential legal consequences are now on the horizon. There are four submissions before international courts and two in the Italian system, accusing Italy, the EU or both of funding and directing the Libyan coastguard.</p> \n<p>\u201cItaly bypassed Hirsi with an artificial edifice of Libyan power, but [an international court] ruling would show that they can\u2019t use this to evade responsibility,\u201d said Itamar Mann, an Israeli lawyer who is <a href=\"https://www.ejiltalk.org/time-to-investigate-european-agents-for-crimes-against-migrants-in-libya/\">leading litigation efforts</a> against the EU and Italy.</p> \n<p>The most recent of these is a complaint to the European court of auditors, the EU\u2019s financial watchdog. The complaint accuses the EU of breaking its own laws by funnelling \u20ac90m <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/trustfundforafrica/region/north-africa/libya/support-integrated-border-and-migration-management-libya-second-phase_en\">earmarked</a> for poverty reduction to the Libyan coastguard.</p> \n<p>Mann alleges that while the Libyans are carrying out the interceptions, in the background it is the EU pulling the strings. \u201cThe EU is using Italy in the same way that Italy is using Libya, to evade responsibility. The main culprit is in Brussels.\u201d</p> \n<p>-----------</p> \n<p>As Seagull 75 left the scene of the rescue last March, the Libyan coastguard radioed back to Operation Sophia to confirm the coordinates. \u201cThree four zero three north, zero one four three one,\u201d said the coastguard. \u201cThat\u2019s correct,\u201d the crew of Seagull 75 replied. The Libyans were pursuing the migrant boats to the northern extreme of Libya\u2019s search and rescue zone.</p> \n<p>The coastguard vessel still could not find the first rubber boat. The second boat was being followed by another Sophia plane, a Spanish aircraft with the callsign Cotos, but it too was running low on fuel. It was becoming increasingly clear that only one of the boats would be rescued that night.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7a98b795-e636-4e75-b443-22e9e6429f26\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/this-is-europe\">This is Europe</a> is a new stream of Guardian journalism that investigates the big challenges that transcend national boundaries, and seeks out the solutions that could benefit us all.

In order to do interceptions, they need to be fed from aerial surveillance,\u201d said Tamino B\u00f6hm, the head of mission for the German NGO Sea Watch. \u201cNearly no effective interceptions would take place without an EU air force assisting them.\u201d</p> \n<p>B\u00f6hm, whose NGO flies its own small surveillance plane through the same skies as Sophia, lists case after case where EU flights relayed data on boats in distress to the Libyan coastguard and to private Libya-bound ships. He notes that NGO vessels and European ships were not called on to rescue as often \u2013 a possible violation of international maritime law.</p> \n<p>\u201cEuropean actors are not only complicit with but directly responsible for pushbacks to Libya,\u201d B\u00f6hm added.</p> \n<p>The UN refugee agency\u2019s special envoy for the central Mediterranean, Vincent Cochetel, said nobody in the international community could pretend they did not understand how dangerous Libya had become.</p> \n<p>Under these circumstances, he said, \u201cno asset of a third country \u2013 naval, aerial or intelligence \u2013 should be used to facilitate return from international waters to Libya.\u201d</p> \n<p>The main connection between European air surveillance and Libyan interceptions at sea is still the rescue coordination centre in Rome. According to two German legal professors, Anuscheh Farahat and Nora Markard, this makes Italy responsible for internationally wrongful acts, \u201cnamely where it violates its obligations under the international law of the sea to make sure a rescue operation leads to a delivery to a place of safety.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"09c80795755a8a2586451997df46d448ca767feb\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09c80795755a8a2586451997df46d448ca767feb/0_0_1900_1071/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A screengrab taken from an undated video from Frontex shows a fishing trawler pulling away from a wooden boat with refugees and migrants onboard\" width=\"1000\" height=\"564\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A screengrab taken from an undated video from Frontex shows a fishing trawler pulling away from a wooden boat with refugees and migrants onboard.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frontex/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Mario Giro was Italy\u2019s deputy foreign minister for two years while the strategy to support the Libyan coastguard was first being developed. Giro said he believed Italian and European leaders, and in particular Italy\u2019s then interior minister, Marco Minitti, were so focused on stopping the flow of people from Libya that they cut important corners. Italian and European willingness to deal directly with militia members and smugglers was \u201ca mistake, full stop,\u201d Giro said.</p> \n<p>\u201cAt that time it was very clear that everybody in Italy and in Europe on the right and on the left was obsessed with the question of migrants. And everybody wanted a quick, immediate solution in the name of trying to control the public opinion.\u201d</p> \n<p>-----------</p> \n<p>Until now the EU and Italy have skirted the line between financing and supporting the Libyan coastguard and taking control of, and therefore responsibility for, its operations. Even when the mask has slipped, as it did when the telephone number listed for Libya\u2019s new rescue centre was listed as an Italian number, the denial of ultimate responsibility is maintained.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur personnel are not embedded onboard of Libyan coastguard assets and Eunavfor Med [European Naval Force Mediterranean] personnel are not part of the Libyan coastguard and navy\u2019s decision-making process,\u201d said Peter Stano, a spokesperson for the European External Action Service, the EU\u2019s diplomatic corps. \u201cNor is EUnavfor Med entitled to exercise any control and authority over Libyan coastguard and navy\u2019s units or personnel.\u201d</p> \n<p>Stano denied any direct coordination of the Libyan coastguard. \u201c[EU] air assets do not exercise any coordination of Libyan vessels during rescue operations. There is no reconnaissance programme,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>However, an email sent by a Libyan coastguard commodore to Alarm Phone, a volunteer monitoring group, in August 2019, obtained by the Guardian, states that EU air assets directly pass information to them. \u201cPlease be informed that yesterday PV LNCG FEZZAN has conducted nr. 2 S.A.R. events, two rubber boat in dangerous distress (sinking) with about 30 and 50 people on board, North-West of Tripoli (around 70 NM), in PSN 3350N-01239E and 3348N-01218E correlated to reports by EUNAVFORMED air asset D0102 and D0105,\u201d the email said.</p> \n<p>Despite the denials, a reckoning appears closer as an array of international legal actions scrutinise every aspect of this cooperation. What emerges, lawyers claim, is a conspiracy to bypass international law and evade responsibility for effectively blocking the Mediterranean.</p> \n<p>A senior EU official close to Libya policy at the time described the Mediterranean strategy as a \u201cpolitical timebomb\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe EU has taken a major reputational risk,\u201d said the official. \u201cWe put our fate in the hands of crooks, the consequences of which are now arriving.\u201d</p> \n<p>In late 2017, decision-makers in Brussels were split between a group of hardliners who wanted Europe\u2019s migration control outsourced to Libya and a reduction in sea crossings at all costs, and others who argued that Sophia and the NGO ships should be allowed to continue rescue operations. The hardliners won out. Now, more than two years later, the presence of European rescue ships in the central Mediterranean is minimal.</p> \n<p>At the end of the coming year, Frontex, which has begun to assume a greater role in Libya operations, will <a href=\"http://www.ekathimerini.com/232591/article/ekathimerini/news/eu-to-boost-frontex-agency-with-more-funds-and-staff\">become the EU\u2019s biggest agency</a> by budget. </p> \n<p>In February EU foreign ministers <a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/fac/2020/02/17/?utm_source=dsms-auto&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Foreign+Affairs+Council\">called for a renewal of Sophia</a>, but ministers noted that any indication that it was coming into contact with migrant boats could \u201clead to the withdrawal of maritime assets from the relevant area\u201d.</p> \n<p>The fate of those seeking to escape Libya by boat is likely to mirror that of the migrants caught in the lights of the Seagull 75 in March last year. The occupants of one boat were successfully intercepted by the Libyan coastguard. What happened to those on other boat is contested, but the weight of evidence suggests they are missing, presumed dead.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>This article was supported by the Migration Newsroom, an investigative reporting collaboration between Lighthouse Reports and leading European media.</p></li> \n</ul>",

The French Open in May and Wimbledon in June are thought to be safe at the moment, but several other big tournaments will be cancelled.</p> <p>The Miami Open, which was due to start next week, became the first to fall when the Miami-Dade Mayor, Carlos Gimenez, cancelled all mass gatherings and a statement from the ATP later confirmed no tournaments will be held until the end of April at the earliest. </p> <p>Beyond Miami, the other Masters tournament affected will be Monte Carlo (12 April) as well as smaller events in Houston, Marrakech, Barcelona and , Budapest.</p> <p>If the situation allows, the tour will resume with low-key tournaments in Munich and Estoril beginning on April 27, followed a week later by the Madrid Open.</p> <p>The slow response by the ATP, who oversee the men\u2019s game, has frustrated players and tournament directors seeking guidance on the coronavirus crisis that forced the cancellation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/09/indian-wells-tennis-tournament-cancelled-as-coronavirus-fears-spread\">of the Indian Wells Masters</a> and, since then, other minor tournaments.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/12/japan-must-prepare-for-possibility-of-olympics-being-cancelled-says-senior-mp\">Japan must prepare for possibility of Olympics being cancelled, says senior MP</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, after a series of urgent overnight phone calls between tournament organisers and the ATP, confirmation came that the calendar will be suspended indefinitely.</p> <p>In contrast, the game\u2019s oldest governing body, the ITF, responded quickly to the global Covid-19 threat on Wednesday by cancelling the Fed Cup finals in Budapest in April, as well as the play-off matches in eight other venues, including Great Britain\u2019s tie in Mexico.</p> <p>However, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/11/nba-suspend-season-coronavirus\">suspension of the NBA programme</a> and the steadily rising awareness in the United States of the scale of the pandemic ultimately sharpened the focus of tennis administrators there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>If circumstances improve, the second grand slam of the season, the French Open, will be saved, but sources stressed on Thursday there could be no guarantees. Between Roland Garros (24 May) and Wimbledon, which starts on 29 June, a slew of minor tournaments could go ahead, including the Lib\u00e9ma Open in the Netherlands on 8 June, where Murray might have begun his preparation for Queen\u2019s and Wimbledon, and the following week in Halle, where Roger Federer, recovering from knee surgery, potentially would have returned to the game.</p> <p>The Olympic Games in Tokyo in July and August <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/12/japan-must-prepare-for-possibility-of-olympics-being-cancelled-says-senior-mp\">are still under threat</a>, and tennis is monitoring developments as players and federations wait to see if qualification will proceed.

  "<p>The whole of football <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/11/europa-league-coronavirus-wolves-manchester-united-inter-milan-sevilla\">may be in doubt</a> but the Mill is still churning and the transfer vultures still circling. And with Tottenham in apparent \u201ccrisis\u201d, Premier League rivals are looking to pick off some prime cuts. And they don\u2019t come much more prime \u2013 when fit \u2013 than <strong>Harry Kane</strong>, over whom <strong>Manchester United</strong> and <strong>Manchester City</strong> are prepared to have a good old ding-dong, according to reports. They suggest that the England captain\u2019s \u201crepresentatives are exploring options for a potential transfer away from Tottenham\u201d with sources at both Manchester clubs letting their interest be known.

So cold in fact that the relative warmth of the Black Country could beckon, with Jorge Mendes reportedly being summoned into action to \u201cprepare the machinery\u201d for a move to <strong>Wolves</strong>, according to Defensa Central. Everton are keen too, apparently.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/11/danny-drinkwaters-villa-future-in-doubt-after-training-ground-bust-up\">Danny Drinkwater's Villa future in doubt after training ground bust-up</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With goalkeepers who can actually stop the ball and reliably play it out suddenly sought-after, Bournemouth\u2019s <strong>Aaron Ramsdale </strong>is on the radar of <strong>Chelsea</strong> and <strong>Tottenham</strong>, claims the Mail, in light of the flaky recent form of Kepa Arizabalaga and Hugo Lloris, respectively.

They could face competition for the 25-year-old Austria midfielder from their old chums Arsenal, however.</p> <p>Rumour Mill mainstay <strong>Willian</strong> may have been more prominent at Chelsea of late, but so too remains talk of an impending departure. <strong>Bayern Munich</strong> are the latest to stress their interest. For their part <strong>Chelsea</strong> are still very much interested in the full-backs <strong>Alex Telles</strong>, of Porto, and Leicester\u2019s <strong>Ben Chilwell</strong>.</p> <p><strong>West Ham</strong> are pondering a summer bid for Napoli\u2019s <strong>Hirving Lozano </strong>(provided they stay up, one would assume), for a fee close to the \u20ac40m they shelled out for the Mexico international. <strong>Everton</strong> and <strong>Atl\u00e9tico Madrid </strong>may prove more tempting options for the 24-year-old winger, though.</p> <p>In other goalkeeping news, <strong>Leeds </strong>are expected to pay Lorient the buy-out clause that will land the on-loan <strong>Illan Meslier</strong> permanently. Another Championship player attracting gossip is the <strong>Huddersfield striker Karlan Grant</strong>, on whom <strong>Aston Villa</strong> and <strong>West Brom</strong> are keen. Grant has hit 16 goals this season.</p>",

Rita and I are down here in Australia. We felt a bit tired, like we had colds, and some body aches. Rita had some chills that came and went. Slight fevers too. To play things right, as is needed in the world right now,  we were tested for the Coronavirus, and were found to be positive. Well, now. What to do next? The Medical Officials have protocols that must be followed. We Hanks\u2019 will be tested, observed, and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires.  Not much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no? We\u2019ll keep the world posted and updated. Take care of yourselves!

Do your concerns around the ineffectiveness of lower interest rates bear much on the size of the stimulus that you\u2019re announcing today?</p> <p><strong>Josh Frydenberg: </strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, I think one important aspect of all of this is the alignment between monetary and fiscal policy. </p> <p>That\u2019s really important because, as the prime minister said, this is a $17.6 billion package, the bulk of which is going out the door before June 30, and we did welcome the fact that the interest rates were passed on by the banks. </p> <p>I\u2019ve spoken to <strong>Phil Lowe</strong> actually today. And he continues to watch very closely what\u2019s happening with debt yields, what\u2019s happening with bond yields, what\u2019s happening with credit spreads, what\u2019s happening with liquidity in global markets. </p> <p>He\u2019s made some comments about that and obviously monetary policy is the remit of the independent Reserve Bank of Australia. </p> <p>But I think it\u2019s important to understand that this is very different to the GFC in a number of respects. </p> <p>This is not a financial system problem. This is not a liquidity crisis. This is a health crisis. But one of the other differences is that with the GFC, there was a lot more room with monetary policy to respond. </p> <p><strong>This time, monetary policy globally is pretty much exhausted</strong> and we did see the Bank of England substantially reduce their rates down to, I think, 0.25% overnight. So it\u2019s a different situation, but there is an alignment between this government and the Reserve Bank about getting money out the door to support jobs and growth.</p> </blockquote> <p>That is an acknowledgement that the economy is in worse shape, globally, then when the GFC hit.

  "<p>The US actor Tom Hanks and his wife, Rita Wilson, have been diagnosed with coronavirus while filming in Australia.</p> <p>The 63-year-old Academy Award-winning actor is currently on the Gold Coast in Queensland filming Baz Luhrmann\u2019s untitled production about Elvis Presley.</p> <p>Hanks wrote on Instagram on Thursday that after he and Wilson had been feeling \u201ca bit tired, like we had colds\u201d they arranged to be tested for the virus and had been \u201cfound to be positive\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-live-updates-who-declares-pandemic-as-italy-introduces-stricter-measures\">Coronavirus live updates: US suspends all travel from Europe for 30 days, excluding UK</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe felt a bit tired, like we had colds and some body aches,\u201d he wrote on his official Instagram page.</p> <p>\u201cRita had some chills that came and went. Slight fevers too. To play things right, as is needed in the world right now, we were tested for the coronavirus, and were found to be positive.</p> <p>\u201cWell, now. What to do next? The medical officials have protocols that must be followed. We Hanks\u2019 will be tested, observed, and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires. Not much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no?\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian understands that early on Thursday morning cast and crew attached to the film received an email instructing them to stay away from set after a member of the production tested positive for the virus.</p> <p>The couple are now in isolation in a Gold Coast hospital. The premier of Queensland, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said on Thursday that health officials would conduct contact tracing to determine who had been in close contact with Hanks and Wilson.</p> <p>\u201cPeople who have come in close contact with Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson will now need to self isolate and quarantine,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Famously approachable, Hanks had regularly posed for photos with fans at Coolangatta Beach on the Gold Coast and a cafe near Mount Warning on the New South Wales far north coast.</p> <p>But the premier said she did not believe a selfie would constitute close contact.</p> <p>\u201cTom has been having a wonderful time on the Gold Coast and we are so lucky to have Tom in Queensland,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cBut what it is, is people who have come in very close contact with him in recent days [our] experts will now work very closely with him with Baz [Luhrmann] and all the cast the crew and then they will isolate those people who have been in that close proximity.</p> <p>\u201cFrom what the chief health officer has told me it\u2019s over 15 minutes of being in very close contact, so a selfie wouldn\u2019t count as that.\u201d</p> <p>She said Hanks and Wilson would receive \u201cthe best treatment in our hospital\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very confident with the physicians that we have that will be treating Tom and his wife and like I said we wish them all the very best for a speedy recovery,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI know the thoughts of Queenslanders and all Australians are with Tom and Rita during this time.\u201d</p> <p>In a video posted to Instagram Chet Hanks, the couple\u2019s son, said he\u2019d spoken to his parents who were \u201cnot tripping\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up everyone, um, yeah it\u2019s true my parents got coronavirus. Crazy,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI just got off the phone with them, they both are fine, they\u2019re not even that sick, they\u2019re not worried about it, they\u2019re not tripping, but they\u2019re going through the necessary health precautions obviously.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything to be too worried about, I appreciate everyone\u2019s concern and the well wishes but I think it\u2019s all going to be alright.\u201d</p> <p>In the lead up to shooting, normal practice would involve lead actors to have close contact with wardrobe and hair and makeup departments for screen tests and sound tests. These often involve close physical contact with potentially dozens of crew.</p> <p>Production on the Luhrmann film had been set to begin filming on Monday. In a statement the US production company behind the film, Warner Bros, said it was \u201ctaking precautions\u201d to protect its employees.</p> <p>\u201cThe health and safety of our company members is always our top priority, and we are taking precautions to protect everyone who works on our productions around the world,\u201d the company said in a statement.</p> <p>\u201cWe have been made aware that a company member from our Elvis feature film, which is currently in pre-production in The Gold Coast, Australia, has tested positive for Covid-19 (coronavirus).</p> <p>\u201cWe are working closely with the appropriate Australian health agencies to identify and contact anyone who may have come in direct contact with the individual.</p> <p>\u201cThe individual who tested positive for Covid-19 is currently receiving treatment.\u201d</p> <p>Hanks and Wilson, who is an American singer and actor, had been travelling to different locations in Australia and had posted photos from Sydney and Brisbane on Instagram.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B9duHWNHcs6/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

  "<p>Sleepless parents, hard-partying students and anyone who works antisocial hours or is on a tight budget will know that a well-stocked kitchen cupboard is your best friend and that if you look after it, it will look after you. Now, however, the rest of us are getting a reminder, as the coronavirus outbreak forces thousands of us into self-isolation. Here are some ideas for what to cook if you are forced to rely on what you already have, rather than popping to the shops for ingredients.</p> <h2><strong>Pilaf</strong><br></h2> <p>Yotam Ottolenghi <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/23/pilaf-recipes-yotam-ottolenghi\" title=\"\">once pointed out</a> that there are as many variations on pilaf as there are nations in south and west Asia, the Middle East, India, the Balkans and large swathes of Africa. He was focusing on rice cooked with broth and other ingredients, but the cookbook writer Vicky Boghal has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/apr/18/chef-vicky-bhogal-interview-kitchen-encounters\" title=\"\">an even simpler go-to</a> using cooked rice. Sautee it briskly with whatever you have to hand: finely chopped veg (fresh or from a can), sliced leftovers, tinned fish or cured meat and a drizzle of oil. To flavour, add your favourite condiment (soy sauce, Marmite, fish sauce, ketchup), spices (cumin, coriander), pickles (capers, jalapenos), dried fruit or herbs (dried parsley, thyme, rosemary) and a splash of water, and cover to steam for 10 minutes. Finish with seeds (I like sesame), fresh herbs if you have any or chopped nuts. Just to prove how eminently adaptable this dish is, Nigel Slater makes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/mar/13/nigel-slater-simple-supper-recipes\" title=\"\">a bacon and mushroom version</a> with bulgur wheat in place of rice: even the grain can be replaced ...</p> <h2><strong>Flatbread pizza</strong><br></h2> <p>Caroline Craig and Sophie Missing have perfected cooking from basics. Their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/sep/10/rice-krispie-scotch-eggs-turkish-pizza-recipe-caroline-craig-sophie-missing-cook-residency\" title=\"\">pizza base</a> mixes 160g self-raising flour with 150g Greek yoghurt, some salt and some cumin. But the Awesome Green\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theawesomegreen.com/very-green-vegan-flatbread-pizza/\" title=\"\">vegan version</a> will do just as well \u2013 230g whole wheat flour mixed with 125 ml water, 1 tbsp oil, salt and nigella or some other kind of seed. Knead into a dough, then halve and roll out to the size of an oven-proof frying pan (or else transfer once fried to a baking sheet). Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas mark 7, and heat your frying pan on a high heat. Once hot, add a tiny splash of oil and carefully place the rolled-out dough in it. Fry on both sides for about five minutes, then top with whatever you have on your shelves. Pesto, tomato paste, even ketchup will work; olives, capers, tinned peppers or aubergine; any grated cheese, any cured meat. Transfer to the oven and bake for five to 10 minutes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"02302c9e602625ffca4a53e01df9876658104147\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02302c9e602625ffca4a53e01df9876658104147/0_246_4287_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flatbread pizzas\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flatbread pizza is simple to make and can be topped with things you find in your cupboard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claudia Totir/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Chilli</strong><br></h2> <p>The writer and campaigner Jack Monroe is, of course, the undisputed queen of cooking with canned goods, and not out of affectation. Her resourcefulness is exemplary, as demonstrated in <a href=\"https://cookingonabootstrap.com/2019/11/03/budget-chilli-recipe/\" title=\"\">this bootstrap chilli</a> (to serve four), adapted from a Gordon Ramsay beef dish. Drain and rinse two cans of beans (Monroe uses red kidney and baked beans \u2013 you could try any others, or cook your own from scratch. The website Serious Eats says you can cook 130g of dry beans in place of a standard 400g tin). Cover with water and boil for 10 minutes, then simmer until soft. In a pan, fry some chopped onion in oil with cumin and paprika (hot sauce and dried or fresh chilli would work, too). Add a tin of chopped tomatoes, a stock cube and a splash of red wine. Add the drained beans and some dark chocolate and stir to combine. Serve with rice, or cold in a burrito, and any add-ons you have lying around: more hot sauce or salsa, jalapenos, sour cream or Greek yoghurt, fresh green leaves, grated cheddar \u2026</p> <h2><strong>Coconut milk bread pudding</strong><br></h2> <p>Author Emily Han <a href=\"https://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-coconut-bread-pudding-137917\" title=\"\">has made this</a> with every kind of bread. Arrange torn pieces of bread in a buttered baking dish and sprinkle with your choice of dried fruit (candied ginger, golden raisins, dates, you name it) and nuts. Pour over a mixture of one can of coconut milk (or other plant milk), three eggs (3 tbsp flax or chia seeds mixed with 9 tbsp water are a handy vegan substitute), sugar (Han\u2019s recipe says 200g, which is a lot; replace with honey, maple syrup, jam or date syrup to the quantity you are comfortable with), sweet spice (cardamom goes wonderfully with pistachios), vanilla if you like it and a pinch of salt. Bake at 170C (150C fan)/325F/gas mark 3 for 45 minutes.</p> <h2><strong>Store cupboard noodles</strong><br></h2> <p>Dried noodles are the perfect quick fix, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jan/19/best-budget-recipes-store-cupboard-ingredients\" title=\"\">Fuchsia Dunlop puts it</a>. All you need is something to make a sauce (oil, salt and heat), and something crunchy to put on top. She has an excellently simplified version of a Sichuan sauce (to serve four) mixing 4 tbsp peanut butter (in place of sesame; you could easily substitute with tahini or another nut butter) with 2 \u00bd tbsp soy sauce and a dash of vinegar (she uses Chinkiang, but says red wine vinegar works fine, too). She mixes in oil (chilli and sesame; olive would work just as well, with chilli flakes, chopped fresh chilli or a dash of hot sauce) and minced garlic, and whisks with enough stock or water to get the consistency of single cream. Cook four servings of noodles to packet instructions, then drain and divide between four bowls, top with the sauce, chopped chives or spring onions if you have any and a sprinkling of sesame seeds or chopped cashews. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/01/readers-recipe-swap-student-recipes-noodles-spaghetti-pizza-mars-bar-ice-cream\" title=\"\">Tinned fish</a> would add bulk, as would any finely sliced salad vegetables (cucumber, tomato, celery, lettuce).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46286bbb086b8599d8871c61556690de39ae6909\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46286bbb086b8599d8871c61556690de39ae6909/0_217_4841_2905/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dry egg noodles\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dry egg noodles: \u2018the perfect fix\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Summers/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Squash stew</strong><br></h2> <p>Slater does <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/mar/13/nigel-slater-simple-supper-recipes\" title=\"\">an excellent pumpkin dish</a> that could work just as well with butternut squash or sweet potato. Fry 800g of chopped squash with some oil until golden brown. Remove then fry a chopped onion until brown, stir in some tomato puree, add a tin of chopped tomatoes, a canful of water and season with the spice or dried herb of your choice (he uses oregano; thyme, parsley, rosemary or fennel would be lovely, too, as would cumin, coriander etc) and salt and pepper. Return the squash to the pan and simmer until soft \u2013 about 25 minutes. Serve with some kind of grain (bread, pasta, rice) and top with what you like: a dollop of something creamy, hot sauce or chilli flakes, fresh herbs, green leaves, a squeeze of lemon \u2026</p> <h2><strong>Patties</strong><br></h2> <p>One of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jun/14/california-food-recipes-roast-carrot-burger-avocado-salsa--rainbow-bowl\" title=\"\">most adaptable things around</a> : you need a base (cooked potato or sweet potato, mashed carrots or beans, tofu), bulk (cooked grains, more veg, chopped nuts, breadcrumbs) and flavour (spices, cheese, herbs, onion, garlic, lemon zest, seeds). Mix to obtain something that holds together nicely, then shape into balls and flatten before refrigerating for one hour. Heat some oil in a pan and fry for three to four minutes on both sides. Serve as you would a burger pattie.</p> <h2><strong>Chocolate and olive oil cake</strong><br></h2> <p>Meera Sodha\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/may/11/meera-sodhas-recipe-for-vegan-chocolate-passion-fruit-and-olive-oil-cake\" title=\"\">vegan take</a> on the sticky Swedish kladdkaka is mouthwatering. Being vegan, it uses dry goods and longlife or make-your-own milk substitutes: to 160ml heated olive oil you add 100g dark vegan chocolate to melt. Then mix in 200g plain flour, 200g caster sugar, 60g cocoa powder, some salt, some vanilla extract, 175ml almond milk and some fruit. Sodha uses the pulp of three passion fruit, which is about 3 tbsp; I would try with the same amount of mashed banana, orange juice, yoghurt or nut butter \u2013 or just omit it entirely and see what happens; kladdkaka is famous for being forgiving. Mix until smooth then pour into a lined cake tin and bake for 25 minutes at 200C (180C fan)/400F/gas mark 6 or until a knife comes out clean.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e6a592b872950eeaa9a771c41d4369c644264ecc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6a592b872950eeaa9a771c41d4369c644264ecc/0_204_5211_3126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Swedish kladdkaka\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Swedish kladdkaka can be made in a delicious vegan version using dry goods and longlife milk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Westend61/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Chickpea and bread soup</strong><br></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/mar/23/one-pot-puttanesca-chickpea-soup-and-spicy-popcorn-yotam-ottolenghis-store-cupboard-recipes\" title=\"\">Ottolenghi</a> makes this from scratch, cooking dried chickpeas with some cinnamon and dried chilli. You could just as easily make it with drained canned chickpeas, and add the spice with the other ingredients: garlic, cumin and coriander seeds, tomato paste, harissa (or other chilli paste), some olive oil and season with salt and pepper and some water. Bring to the boil then simmer until the chickpeas are as soft as you would like \u2013 add water as necessary. Before serving, add some lemon juice (fresh or bottled; vinegar works too). Serve with poached eggs (I would just as soon add feta or some other fresh cheese, if I had any), bread to dip and extra harissa and olive oil.</p> <h2><strong>Puy lentil spag bol</strong><br></h2> <p>It is worth remembering how you can make a good spag bol without any meat. Anna Jones adds canned puy lentils to a tomato sauce made with onion, garlic, celery, carrot and one tin each of chopped tomatoes and tomato soup. To which, as she says, you could add pretty much any veg you find in your fridge. Serve with grated parmesan, fried breadcrumbs or fresh herbs.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 12 March 2020. The Jack Monroe recipe for chilli calls for dark chocolate, but not specifically \u201cdark vegan chocolate\u201d as an earlier version said.</p>",
  "<p>As fears grow that the coronavirus is already spreading in the Formula One paddock at the Australian Grand Prix, the world champion, Lewis Hamilton, has admitted he is \u201cshocked\u201d the race is going ahead.</p> <p>Up to eight team members have now been tested for the coronavirus and placed into self-isolation as further doubt is cast over the running of the race on Sunday.

Race fees are one of the three biggest revenue streams for F1. When asked why he thought it was going ahead Hamilton pointedly noted: \u201cCash is king. I can\u2019t add much more to it. I don\u2019t feel like I should shy away from my opinion.\u201d</p> <p>Ferrari\u2019s Sebastian Vettel insisted that the drivers would act collectively to desist from racing were there to be any fatalities associated with F1 from the coronavirus. \u201cWe hope it doesn\u2019t get that far.

  "<h2>Selina, Birmingham</h2> <p><strong>What\u2019s it like?</strong><br>Without endorsing Insta-tourists, I challenge anyone not to share photos of Selina. Snaps of a weekend spent at its newest UK branch, in Birmingham\u2019s Jewellery Quarter, were met with heart-eye emojis and \u201cthat hotel looks beautiful!\u201d comments. The fact it\u2019s a hostel \u2013 with affordable pet-friendly suite rooms (plus dorms), a yoga studio and a South American-style restaurant due to open in the summer \u2013 was something I revelled in sharing.</p> <p>It\u2019s in a former Victorian gold and silverworks factory, with the red-brick exterior still featuring the names of previous business. The maze of corridors (with cubby holes for reading) lead to a range of dorms and private rooms. Dusky pink, eggshell blue and emerald green run throughout, with velvet chairs, bold murals, gold fixtures and large plants. The largest room, The Loft, was a winner for my weekend for 2.5 guests (the half being a small dog). There are high ceilings and large windows, and it has a comfy seating area, desk, small kitchen and bathroom. In the lounge-bar downstairs, there are activities including drink-and-draw sessions with Cass Arts.

Not just for boaters or fisherman, many are now enjoyed by cyclists and walkers, too, with towpaths being planted-up to help create green space, and a \u201cbee super-highway\u201d.

Excavation has continued on the lower ground floor, uncovering older rooms and a staircase thought to have been used by judges to escape trouble. The basement is already used for beer tastings every evening and there are plans to open a whisky bar.</p> <p>The listed building has had many original features restored. The vast courtroom, housing the largest mixed-gender 24-pod-bed dorm, still has original panelling and a vaulted ceiling. There are 200 Japanese-style curtained pod beds across several dorms and 12 private rooms (some en suite) in the former cells, with bolted doors and tiny barred windows. Decor is plain, without being clinical: white walls, grey tartan details. Keep eyes peeled for the graffiti by former inmates on the walls of what were once holding cells, now knocked through to form the staircase; and the refurbished security gates in some corridors. The common room includes pews from the courthouse, with Scots Law pages as wallpaper.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33a34907eee1411a97fddb6464d01078d1501ef1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33a34907eee1411a97fddb6464d01078d1501ef1/0_343_1599_1598/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Code hostel, Edinburgh, dorm beds\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>What about </strong><strong>breakfast and dinner?</strong><br>Breakfast is included, with a buffet of fruit, yogurt, cereals, batter to use in the waffle-maker, along with ingredients for cheese toasties.

It\u2019s been welcoming visitors since July 2019 and offers tours (from \u00a314) with whisky and gin tastings and games in the interactive aroma room. The first official batch of the single malt will be available in 2023. After all that merriment, a hike up Arthur\u2019s Seat will help shake-off hangovers, followed by lunch round the corner at <a href=\"https://www.theoutsiderrestaurant.com/\" title=\"\">The Outsider</a>, serving soups, salads and nutritious, seasonal food, or at <a href=\"http://www.civerinos.com/\" title=\"\">Civerinos</a> for its 20in stone-baked pizzas (slice from \u00a33.95, pie from \u00a319.75).

On the site of a prison, the hostel is in part of the city\u2019s former telephone exchange, built in 1932.</p> <p>The ground floor is mostly taken up with a cafe \u2013 where I was checked in. My private room was on the snug side and dominated by a huge flatscreen television but was cosily warm \u2013 very welcome since it was freezing outside. There was enough space for a double bed (I slept like a log both nights), a small desk and a couple of wireless phone-charging shelves. Clothes storage amounted to hangers on the wall, and one corner of the room had been sacrificed to a prefab en suite.</p> <p>You don\u2019t come to a hostel to spend time in your room, though. I found it a good space to use as a base and for the rate, it\u2019s exceptional value. There are suites, too, if room to spread out is needed, and traditional dorms if feeling sociable.</p> <p><strong>What about breakfast and dinner?</strong><br>Unlike many YHA hostels, there\u2019s no kitchen for guests to cook their own meals. It is possible to bring cooked food in and staff are happy to supply crockery and cutlery. The hostel does, however, run a funky licensed cafe on the premises. At night, this has a bar feel, with its dimmed lights and industrial exposed-brick-and-girder aesthetic. In one corner, a wall is adorned with photos of the prisoner class of 1873, whose stay on this site was less pleasurable than my own.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6153f992294aede31bc7aba407c7507c9d211b18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6153f992294aede31bc7aba407c7507c9d211b18/0_222_4903_2943/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cafe-bar at Newcastle Central YHA Hostel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cafe-bar</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Breakfast is what you might expect in a hostel: a buffet of cereal, yoghurt (dairy and soya), toast, ham and cheese, and hot drinks and juices. The all-day menu features standard dishes, such as stone-baked pizzas, jacket potatoes, and burgers. However, the light bites section is more adventurous: panko squid strips and mock duck pancakes included! I opted for the Mediterranean vegetable and olive salad, a portion of fries and a non-dairy strawberry and yuzu ice-cream \u2013 all very palatable, as was the bill: \u00a313. And should you stay the night and have children under 10 with you, they eat for free.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s on the doorstep?</strong><br>I came by train, so was pleased to find the hostel an uncomplicated 10-minute walk from the city\u2019s mainline station. It\u2019s a stone\u2019s throw from Grainger Town: stuffed with listed buildings and where most of Newcastle\u2019s shopping, eating and drinking gets done. The area is also home to The <a href=\"https://www.thestand.co.uk/newcastle/whats-on/\" title=\"\">Stand Comedy Club</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theatreroyal.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Theatre Royal</a>.

Since 2007, the company has been refurbishing pubs around London, modernising while retaining character, and adding hostel rooms to the underused upper floors.</p> <p>A popular spot on a quiet corner near London Bridge, The Rose &amp; Crown on Union Street opened in June 2019. It\u2019s a mixture of modern bunk dorms with block colour walls in emerald green and yellow, and shared bathrooms. There\u2019s also a large modern double en suite in the loft, with weathered wood and white brick walls, geometric print carpet and a huge bathroom. The common room is the buzzy pub itself. It had a great atmosphere on a Thursday night, after an evening mooching around nearby Bermondsey. Interiors in the pub mix traditional elements such as wood panelling, green tiling and a horseshoe bar, with modern touches of exposed brickwork, white walls and velvet chairs. </p> <p><strong>What about breakfast and dinner?</strong><br>Brunch is served 9am-6pm \u2013 with options from toast with spreads (\u00a32) to full veggie breakfast (\u00a39) and shakshuka (\u00a310). Noon to 10pm, there are also burgers (from \u00a310) \u2013 including vegan ones \u2013 and loaded fries (from \u00a35.50). The bar is available 24/7 for guests.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c52b72ab740eb43ca14cec4b6ce3191183f4830e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c52b72ab740eb43ca14cec4b6ce3191183f4830e/0_133_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Double Ensuite Room at Pub Love London Bridge, hostel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>What\u2019s on the doorstep?</strong><br>A 10-minute walk east, Bermondsey has <a href=\"https://www.bermondsey-beer-mile.co.uk/\" title=\"\">the Beer Mile</a> \u2013 a stretch of tap rooms and indie bottle shops under old railway arches. It\u2019s actually closer to two miles, and there are 18 stops to choose from over an afternoon, with Maltby Street market a good starting point for food \u2013 from cheesy Venezuelan <em>arepa</em> buns to rich Ethiopian lentil <em>wat</em>.</p> <p>Round the corner, Bermondsey Street\u2019s Victorian terraces are now home to independent restaurants, boutique shops, basement bars, plus the <a href=\"https://www.ftmlondon.org/\" title=\"\">Fashion and Textile Museum</a> is here too. If visiting on the last Thursday of the month, the speakeasy-style Izakaya, in the basement of ramen restaurant <a href=\"https://hakata.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Hakata</a>, runs masterclass tasting evenings for free.

His eagerness is borne of potential (25 more beds will be added by June) <em>and</em> adventure, as he and the Sleep Eat Love team are planning a fact-finding tour of Europe and UK hostels. The mission: to improve what Sleep Eat Love offers. For my part, one improvement would be the signposting, as my choice of stairs over lift means a circuitous route around this labyrinth-like former fire station. Still, that allows for fact-finding of my own as I pass hostel staples, such as a laundry room, lounge, games room and kitchen areas.</p> <p>My private en suite double is spacious and wants for nothing, save for a television, though I don\u2019t see that omission as onerous (wifi is free). There are industrial design touches in its lights and fittings, while a flourish-free bed, wardrobe and mirror-frame have a woodchip-effect. It\u2019s all functional and sturdy \u2013 with brightness provided by a colourful mural \u2013 but lacks an overall aesthetic, which explains the team\u2019s search for ideas. The feel of the hostel (and communal spaces) is friendly and secure, aided by a reception staffed 24/7.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aebbe6e002991bbbad8f899325c0ea8303b3d209\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aebbe6e002991bbbad8f899325c0ea8303b3d209/0_490_3758_3758/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bunk beds at Sleep Eat Love Hostel, Liverpool.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>What about breakfast and dinner?</strong><br>Sleep Eat Love\u2019s star turn is its indie-owned veggie- and vegan-friendly cafe-restaurant, <a href=\"https://love-thy-neighbour.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Love Thy Neighbour</a>, which is in the same building \u2013 and open to all, though it offers 20% discount to hostel guests. Open 7am-6pm Sunday to Thursday and 7am to 9pm on Fridays and Saturdays, it serves healthy dishes and comfort food, including chickpea pancakes, and smoothie bowls (The Detox: pineapple, apple, spinach, kale, ginger, spirulina, chlorella, wheatgrass and barley grass, \u00a37.80), along with fryups and burgers. For me, a late lunch means a substantial Sweet &amp; Spicy \u201cBuddha\u201d bowl of sweet potato wedges, hummus, charred tenderstem broccoli, coconut paprika chickpeas, coriander, toasted peanuts (\u00a39.95); with breakfast a more straightforward, but equally accomplished, Eggs Benedict (\u00a37.50).

  "<p><em><br></em>The Greek government has been warned by the EU executive that it must uphold the right to asylum, as leaders from Brussels travel to Athens for talks on the migrant crisis at the EU\u2019s borders.</p> <p>Ylva Johansson, EU commissioner for home affairs, said she wanted to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/turkey-erdogan-holds-talks-with-eu-leaders-over-border-opening\">discuss a detention centre</a> where asylum seekers were reported to have been captured and beaten, before being expelled from Greece without the chance to speak to a lawyer or claim asylum.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/world/europe/greece-migrants-secret-site.html\">New York Times reported on Tuesday of \u201ca black site\u201d</a> in north eastern Greece where migrants are held without legal recourse before being expelled to Turkey.</p> <p>Johansson, a Swedish social democrat who took charge of EU migration policy a little more than 100 days ago, said she would raise the issue of the detention centre with Greek government ministers on Thursday. </p> <p>\u201cThese kind of temporary detentions that they have set up \u2013 is one of the things I would like to know more about \u2026 Of course you can have detention for some period of people that have come, but of course you can\u2019t beat them,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The commission has been accused of failing to uphold EU law since Greece announced earlier this month it was suspending asylum applications for one month, a move at odds with European law and the Geneva convention.</p> <p>While the UN agency for refugees has said the Greek decision has no legal basis, the commission has said it needs time to assess the situation.</p> <p>Sidestepping whether Greece\u2019s decision was illegal, Johansson said: \u201cWe are going to discuss actually what they are doing, but they have to let people apply for asylum.\u201d</p> <p>She also said the commission did not plan to suspend the right to asylum by invoking a little-known clause of the EU treaty that allows Brussels to propose \u201cprovisional measures\u201d, to help a member state facing an emergency because of large numbers of migrant arrivals.</p> <p>Greece\u2019s prime minister Kyri\u00e1kos Mitsot\u00e1kis announced he was involving article 78.3 earlier this month when he said all asylum applications would be suspended. That measure requires a proposal from the commission that is agreed by EU member states.</p> <p>Johansson said the commission would not propose suspending the right to asylum. \u201cIndividuals in the European Union have the right to apply for asylum. This is in the treaty, this is in international law. This we can\u2019t suspend.\u201d</p> <p>The Swedish commissioner was due to be accompanied on the visit to Greece by the European commission president Ursula von der Leyen, who drew criticism from the left when she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/migration-eu-praises-greece-as-shield-after-turkey-opens-border\">described Greece as Europe\u2019s \u201cshield\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Von der Leyen later postponed her meeting with the Greek prime minister, in order to focus on the coronavirus.</p> <p>Speaking in the European parliament this week, the leader of the Socialists and Democrats, Iratxe Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rez, said: \u201cShields are used to protect ourselves against weapons, but we are talking about the lives of vulnerable people, of human beings.\u201d The Spanish socialist also accused the commission of ignoring the Geneva convention.</p> <p>Tensions erupted earlier this month when Turkey opened its borders and began sending migrants towards the EU, creating a stand-off that adds to pressure on Greece, where thousands of refugees and migrants are living in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/lesbos-fears-repeat-of-2015-as-refugees-target-greek-island\">squalid camps on the islands.</a><br><br>The Swedish commissioner has pledged to revive a long-blocked reform of the EU asylum system. A 2016 attempt to overhaul European asylum law foundered in the wake of fierce opposition from Hungary, Poland and others opposed to mandatory quotas of refugees.</p> <p>Johansson said she favoured \u201ca mandatory solidarity mechanism\u201d but details of what that meant had still to be finalised. Previous attempts to find a compromise suggested that countries opposed to refugee quotas could pay money or offer equipment to states in need, but none failed to break the deadlock.</p> <p>The commissioner said she felt positive about finding a compromise. \u201cEverybody realises that [there is] a lack of a common European migration and asylum policy \u2013 we are paying a price for that and it shows right now with the crisis in Greece.\u201d</p>",

A number of passengers on Mello\u2019s Turkish Airlines flight left with him, waiting by the airline\u2019s counter for their luggage, some on hold with customer service. <br></p> <p>\u201cThere are just so many differentials that can happen,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there is one case (of coronavirus) in Turkey, but imagine in five days they find 400 people and then they say you have to stay 14 days in quarantine. It just wouldn\u2019t be great to go for five days and then end up stuck for 30 days.\u201d<br></p> <p>Reggie Chand, 34, and Esther Goundar, 32, were flying through Istanbul to Athens for a two-week trip to celebrate their fifth wedding anniversary. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe got checked in, we got our boarding tickets from here to Turkey, from Turkey to Athens,\u201d Goundar said. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting in the lounge area and then I got a text message from my friend: \u2018Hey, are you going to get stuck in Europe?\u2019\u201d <br></p> <p>Chand and Goundar are American citizens. They did not know when they canceled the trip they had been planning since October that the ban did not apply to them, but looking back, they still think they made the right decision. \u201cIt\u2019s too much risk,\u201d Goundar said. \u201cEven if the vacation goes well, and we come back, either way you stay two weeks on vacation and then stay isolated for two weeks. It\u2019s too much.\u201d<br></p> <p>The couple felt a mixture of disappointment and anger over the whole ordeal -- Chand had been on hold with Turkish Airlines for more than an hour, looking to get a refund for their tickets. <br></p> <p>\u201cI am kind of mad,\u201d Chand said. \u201cHe could have said, OK you have two days or three days, or I\u2019m going to talk to airlines so you can have something planned so nobody is stuck in Europe. What if we had gone and we were now stuck there?\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cThat would have pissed me off,\u201d Goundar said. \u201cIf we were already on the flight and we were told you cannot go home for the next 29 days, we would not have enjoyed our vacation.\u201d<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e69af688f08c2df6d277ffe\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T03:44:13.733Z\">3.44am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The president apparently misstated a number of things</strong> during his televised address.

As a result, the campaign is arguing that it\u2019s \u201cnearly impossible\u201d for Vermont senator Bernie Sanders to catch up to Biden\u2019s delegate lead. </p> <p>That\u2019s according to an internal campaign memo obtained by The Guardian. The memo comes a day after Biden trounced Sanders in the latest round of Democratic primary contests on Tuesday. </p> <p>\u201cVotes are still being counted, but it appears that we will net somewhere around 70-80 delegates from March 10 contests alone,\u201d the memo reads. \u201cFor context, on a day we expected would be the toughest day for us in the March calendar, we netted approximately the same number of delegates that we netted on Super Tuesday. This brings our total projected delegate lead to approximately 160.\u201d</p> <p>Sanders\u2019 path forward is precarious. He trails Biden by over 150 delegates. Biden beat Sanders in Michigan on Tuesday, the most delegate-rich state of the six and one that Sanders surprisingly won in 2016. Sanders in a press conference on Wednesday said he planned to still stay in the race but conceded the path is difficult for him. In a fundraising email to supporters, Sanders said: \u201cwe are winning \u2014 very clearly \u2014 the ideological debate, we are losing, right now, the electability debate.\u201d</p> <p>According to the memo, the Biden campaign sees the next few states as advantageous for the former vice president. \u201cThe states that vote next - Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Ohio, and Georgia - have been some of our strongest, and we expect to significantly expand our delegate lead in those highly-supportive, delegate-rich states. Of 682 delegates awarded in those states, conservative estimates have us winning more than 400 delegates and netting more than 150 delegates.\u201d</p> <p>The memo concludes: \u201cShould our broad base of support remain - and we have seen no signs that would indicate otherwise - it will be nearly impossible for Sanders to recoup his current delegate disadvantage.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e69714b8f08c2df6d277e76\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-11T23:19:58.485Z\">11.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It\u2019s unclear what, exactly, Donald Trump will say when he addresses the coronavirus threat tonight.

But they didn\u2019t agree that the Vermont senator is their best bet to beat Donald Trump. The establishment didn\u2019t lock Bernie out. Black voters across the south made the pragmatic decision that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a> is the man to unseat the US president. A broad coalition of voters, from suburban women to white men without a college degree, took their cue from South Carolina and flocked around Biden. It was a flood on Tuesday. Florida and Georgia are ready to pile on the bandwagon.</p> <p>Turnout is up across the nation, especially in Michigan, where Biden and not Sanders is the beneficiary. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats\">Democrats</a> are declaring they cannot tolerate any more Trump. They believe Biden can manage a panic. The wave has laid Sanders asunder.

Getting Donald Trump out of office, which is why, I suspect, primary voters went for what they see as the safe choice instead of the candidate promising free healthcare, free college, free puppies and pizza every Friday (and who\u2019s going to pay for it? Billionaires!). That, or young people were too busy making TikToks to show up.</p> <p>What I\u2019m curious about is what comes next: will the legions of young people who knocked on doors and memed their hearts out for Sanders become so disillusioned by the Democratic party that they sit out the general election, write in Bernie Sanders, lodge a protest vote for Trump or leave the party altogether?

In fact, some of the most questionable decisions of his 2020 campaign \u2013 doing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/16/bernie-sanders-draws-enthusiastic-cheers-in-surprising-fox-news-town-hall\">Fox News Town Hall</a> and touting a <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/blog/meet-press-blog-latest-news-analysis-data-driving-political-discussion-n988541/ncrd1123066#blogHeader\">controversial endorsement</a> by Joe Rogan \u2013 were based on the rationale that Sanders alone could win back white working-class voters who had abandoned the Democratic party for Trump.</p> <p>Despite trailing in the polls by <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna1153246\">25%</a>, he had eked out a narrow but significant win over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 primaries.

Despite all the hype after the first three primaries, in wildly unrepresentative and largely irrelevant states, Sanders was winning by pluralities between one-quarter and one-third of the vote. In several cases his support was only half that of 2016, suggesting his surprise success last time was as much anti-Clinton protest as pro-Sanders support. Even when the field started to thin, Sanders only won a majority in his home state of Vermont, and only barely so.</p> <p>While Super Tuesday was brutal for the large size of the Biden wins, the modest Sanders wins were equally telling. Despite massive campaigning efforts in terms of both money and personnel and very favorable poll numbers for weeks, Sanders won just 34% of the vote in California. Biden, who had barely campaigned in the Golden State, came second with 27%, just seven points behind.</p> <p>Read the full piece:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/10/why-bernie-sanders-lost-michigan\">Why Bernie Sanders lost Michigan \u2013 and what it means for his campaign | Cas Mudde</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e68ea8c8f087df56e4c6778\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-11T13:47:53.821Z\">1.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6418fc535385d4f9d1cb31c6c5b6f3305ca286e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6418fc535385d4f9d1cb31c6c5b6f3305ca286e/0_133_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Supporters of Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden attend a campaign rally at Renaissance High School in Detroit, Michigan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supporters of Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden attend a campaign rally at Renaissance High School in Detroit, Michigan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Kowalsky/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9cc3c850ab6376882e40f5411cc896ddc4e1a21d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cc3c850ab6376882e40f5411cc896ddc4e1a21d/0_0_4377_2626/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Huntington Center is seen empty after Democratic presidential candidate Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders cancels his rally planned in Cleveland, Ohio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Huntington Center is seen empty after Democratic presidential candidate Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders cancels his rally planned in Cleveland, Ohio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Megan Jelinger/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5fcb6c5d18cb1f45ad6032a3e6e449bd1dbb053\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5fcb6c5d18cb1f45ad6032a3e6e449bd1dbb053/0_280_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Democratic presidential hopeful former Vice President Joe Biden speaks, flanked by his wife Jill Biden, at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Democratic presidential hopeful former Vice President Joe Biden speaks, flanked by his wife Jill Biden, at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae97aced02c4960ba40596cf511002a6e4e1f4a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae97aced02c4960ba40596cf511002a6e4e1f4a6/0_195_5845_3507/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Volunteers take down a rally stage for Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden in Cleveland, Ohio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Volunteers take down a rally stage for Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden in Cleveland, Ohio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Megan Jelinger/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e68e8668f087df56e4c6764\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/tom-perkins\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-11T13:36:17.574Z\">1.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">'Hard to comprehend\u2019: Sanders\u2019 loss in Michigan crushes staff and supporters</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In the days leading up to a must-win Tuesday Michigan primary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders\">Bernie Sanders</a> criss-crossed the state, firing up thousands of supporters and taking the stage with star surrogates in a bid to repeat his momentum-shifting 2016 upset of Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>As the polls closed, it seemed to some that a surprise win might not be out of the question.

The next major slate of primaries is on March 17, and includes Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio. </p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/fl/florida_democratic_presidential_primary-6847.html\">Florida</a>, Biden is 42.5 points ahead of his rival in polling averages, while recent polling in <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/az/arizona_democratic_primary-6898.html\">Arizona</a> shows Biden at +28. Sanders lost all four states to Hillary Clinton in 2016.</p> <p>But Sanders seems unlikely to go quietly \u2013 despite his decision not to speak after the results last night. His campaign said last night that he fully intended to take on Biden in Sunday\u2019s debate in Arizona, and he still has a fiercely loyal support base, especially among the young and Latinos. </p> <p>In 2016, his decision to stay in the race all the way to the bitter end \u2013 only endorsing Clinton in July of that year \u2013 was perceived by many of his supporters as helping push Clinton\u2019s platform to the left, for example on healthcare. He may well aim to do the same with Biden this year. </p> <p>Clinton supporters, of course, bitterly resent the fact Sanders stayed in the race so long, believing it weakened her in the general election, perhaps crucially. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"301d04393146ab86f669a693fd827b20d8a79fb2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/301d04393146ab86f669a693fd827b20d8a79fb2/91_0_2839_1703/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders: mulling next moves.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernie Sanders: mulling next moves.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Sancya/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e68c2418f08c2df6d277546\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-11T10:50:36.469Z\">10.50am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Donald Trump\u2019s response to last night\u2019s primary results seemed a little off the pace, continuing to blame Elizabeth Warren for Bernie Sanders\u2019 defeats:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1237603152490147850\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Pocahontas, working in conjunction with the Democrat Party, totally destroyed the campaign of Bernie Sanders.

  "<p>Donald Trump has announced that the US would temporarily suspend most travel from the European Union, as the country reckons with the spread of coronavirus and the White House grapples with the severity of the situation.</p> \n<p>The restrictions, which would begin on Friday and last for 30 days, would not apply to US citizens or to travelers from the UK. The restrictions apply to most foreign nationals who have been in the 26 countries of the Schengen area during the 14 days before their planned arrival in the US.</p> \n<p>Trump made the announcement in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1237841878889840642\">an Oval Office speech</a> on Wednesday evening on the federal response to what the World Health Organization has declared a global pandemic.</p> \n<p>During the rare address to the nation, Trump defended his administration\u2019s response while laying blame on the European Union for not acting quickly enough to address the \u201cforeign virus\u201d, saying US clusters had been \u201cseeded\u201d by European travelers.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe made a lifesaving move with early action on China,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we must take the same action with Europe.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump also downplayed warnings of a potential recession: \u201cThis is not a financial crisis, this is just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome as a nation and as a world,\u201d he said. <br><br>\u201cThe vast majority of Americans, the risk is very, very low,\u201d he added, but he said that older Americans should avoid travel and endorsed social distancing and avoiding large gatherings. \u201cEvery community faces different risks,\u201d he noted and encouraged Americans to listen to local officials.</p> \n<p>The president also said he would take \u201cemergency action\u201d to provide relief to workers who are affected. He said he was asking Congress for $50bn for small business loans, and he also called for \u201cimmediate\u201d payroll tax cuts.</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s speech came on a tumultuous day as cases in the US topped 1,000 and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/us-coronavirus-death-toll-states-total-cases\">number of deaths rose to 37</a>, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/11/us-stocks-latest-bull-to-bear-market-signs-coronavirus-impact\">fluctuations in the financial markets</a> continued and Washington strained to respond. Testifying on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned that the outbreak in the US is going to get worse.</p> \n<p>\u201cI can say we will see more cases, and things will get worse than they are right now,\u201d Fauci told the House Oversight and Reform Committee. He said it is \u201c10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/donald-trump-coronavirus-response\">'A tweet can't knock over a pandemic': has Trump met his match in coronavirus?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In a statement, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the affected countries include: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland\u201d.</p> \n<p>The acting DHS secretary, Chad Wolf, said that guidance on the travel suspension would come within the next two days.</p> \n<p>The department also clarified that restrictions would not apply to legal permanent residents, or to most immediate family members of US citizens.

They ended up driving to the airport to cancel their flight to Spain in person, but after Tseeng canceled the flight, they learned that the rule did not apply to American citizens like them.</p> \n<p>In the end, they felt it was best that they postponed their trip for now. \u201cIn one day, the whole situation completely changed,\u201d Tseeng said. \u201cWe just don\u2019t want to risk not being able to come back.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Agencies contributed reporting</em></p>"
