So far the March coronavirus appeal has generated $1bn.</p> \n  <p>The extra money would be used to help with testing, basic aid as well as the easing the logistics of continuing the delivery of aid in a pandemic. OCHA expects the biggest impact may be economic due to collapse in commodity prices, fall in trade flows, elimination of tourism and ending of remittances home.</p> \n  <p>Mark Lowcock, the head of the agency, is predicting for the first time in 20 years the proportion of people living in poverty will rise. One reason will be that the numbers classified as one step away from famine and dependent on food aid will rise from 130m to 260m. He is arguing with wealthy countries that unless they respond there will be a spate of famines, and problems stored up for as long as a decade, including migration and terrorism.</p> \n  <p>Overall OCHA has proposed $90bn could protect the poor with two thirds dedicated to social protection programs coming from the strengthened balance sheets of international financial institutions. The remaining third - $30bn \u2013 may will have to be delivered by humanitarian agencies funded by an increase in official development assistance.</p> \n  <p>Novel forms of protection are being experimented in low income countries, including open air education, less frequent food distributions, an increase in cash distribution through text messaging and on line education of health workers</p> \n  <p>The increased appeal comes despite a slower than expected spread of the virus than previously foreseen, but OCHA admits information on the spread of virus is still primitive in some countries such as Afghanistan and Yemen.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea9bd138f087455863180d6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/lorenzo-tondo\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-29T17:51:22.528Z\">6.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A video emerged on Wednesday of an illegal horse race in Palermo, <strong>Italy</strong>, that went ahead in defiance of the coronavirus lockdown, writes <strong>Lorenzo Tondo</strong>, who is based in the city. </p> \n  <p>The clips show dozens of scooters, surrounding the horses that are running in a street near the University of Palermo.

  "<p>Andy Cole gazes out of my laptop screen and, even in our strange virtual world, I can see clearly how his face creases with pain. His familiar voice resonates around the room as he explains how low he has felt these past weeks while in self-isolation and dealing with the continuing problems of a kidney transplant in 2017.</p> <p>\u201cThere are many, many times when I want to give up, period, not just on life but give up on everything,\u201d Cole says. \u201cIt becomes so difficult. I was struggling last Wednesday. It totally came out of the blue and I had to stay in bed. I conceded defeat and accepted that today\u2019s not going to be my day. Previously, I would fight. But, ultimately, I know I can\u2019t beat it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/27/psg-nadia-nadim-football-refugee-reconstructive-surgeon-taliban-denmark\">PSG's Nadia Nadim: 'I know the value of helping a person when they have no hope'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The former Manchester United and Newcastle United striker, who has been working as an assistant coach at Southend United, is 48 now. Eighteen months ago <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/oct/26/andy-cole-manchester-united-interview-kidney-transplant\" title=\"\">I interviewed Cole</a> and he described the psychological and physical aftermath of his kidney transplant in searing detail. His battle has now been intensified by Covid-19 and the ensuing lockdown. Cole is being tested to his very limits.</p> <p>\u201cThe past five years have been a shit storm. When I met you in October 2018 the biggest shit storm was just starting.\u201d</p> <p>So it got worse? \u201cIt certainly did,\u201d he says softly. \u201cIt certainly did.\u201d</p> <p>He looks bereft and, in a normal situation, I might reach out and touch him lightly on the arm. It would be a small gesture to offer some comfort. But all I can say is how sorry I am.</p> <p>Cole looks up with a little smile. \u201cI\u2019m still here. That\u2019s the most important thing. But people don\u2019t understand what you go through with this illness. They look at a transplant patient and say: \u2018You\u2019re OK. You look really well.\u2019 Externally that can be true. But, internally, many things are going on. You\u2019re dealing with the medication and your moods. I\u2019ve been very fortunate I\u2019m never angry about it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c985f3d99ea045c6f4d42f682fd611ffe73efe28\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c985f3d99ea045c6f4d42f682fd611ffe73efe28/0_109_4282_2584/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Cole directs the team warm-up as Southend United\u2019s assistant coach before the lockdown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"603\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andy Cole directs the team warm-up as Southend United\u2019s assistant coach before the lockdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Whitby Boot/SUFC/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYour mental wellbeing is paramount because it\u2019s so tough to deal with a disease that one day you feel unbelievably well and the next day you feel like a bag of shit. That was me last Wednesday. I asked myself: \u2018What did you do on Tuesday to make you feel like this on Wednesday?\u2019 Nothing. It was just that Wednesday came and I felt like a bag of shit. Couldn\u2019t get out of bed. Thursday, I was OK again. I have to accept that sometimes my body is going to say: \u2018I\u2019m not having you today.\u2019 So you have to rest and recuperate, and come back the day after.\u201d</p> <p>Cole still wants to spread hope. On Thursday he launches the <a href=\"https://kidneyresearchuk.org/andycolefund/\">Andy Cole Fund</a> in conjunction with Kidney Research UK. The aim will be to raise money to enhance research into improving kidney transplants and patient wellbeing. Three million people in the UK have kidney disease and 36% of people on the kidney donor waiting list are from a BAME background.</p> <p>\u201cKidney Research came to me,\u201d Cole says. \u201cI had an opportunity to pop down to Bristol where their lab is and I was absolutely blown away by everything they\u2019re trying to improve. I sat in a room with 10 people and the chairman talked about the process of how they break things down and collect data. What really resonated with me was when he said so many people detested their bodies after a transplant. The mindset was, \u2018I can\u2019t look at myself. I hate myself.\u2019 That\u2019s the process I was going through. I look at the scars across my chest and stomach and think it\u2019s repulsive. Then, you hear so many people going through the same thing. So I want to help people.\u201d</p> <p>Right now, however, his transplant problems have been accentuated by the lockdown blues. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard and, day by day, it\u2019s getting harder. Once you have this disease you want to get out, exercise and be around people. When you\u2019re confined to a small space and you have to stay indoors and you can\u2019t socialise, it\u2019s really tough. I\u2019ve been living on my own the past two years. I used to find it really comforting to go see someone for a chat. It got me out of the house. Yes, we can have as many Zoom calls as we like but it\u2019s not the same as being out, speaking to people, having a laugh.\u201d</p> <p>Cole stresses that his family and friends are looking out for him on his own in north London. \u201cMentally, it\u2019s numbing. Getting up in the morning, you ask yourself: \u2018Right, what can you do today?\u2019 You end up doing the same things and there\u2019s only a certain amount of time you can clean up. It\u2019s a bit OCD but, ultimately, there\u2019s nothing else I can do. I keep saying to my mates: \u2018I\u2019m toast, I\u2019m toast.\u2019 It\u2019s that hard mentally. But I\u2019m humbled by how much my friends really love me and appreciate me still being here. What they\u2019ve done for me over the past six weeks, and five years previously, has been absolutely unbelievable. Same with my family.\u201d</p> <p>He is still separated from his wife, Shirley, to whom he had apologised in our 2018 interview. \u201cI let a lot of people down by not speaking about my situation. I just wanted to think it would clear itself up. It was never going to do that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"525b575ca7fb0954aa9cb46c5b07091b17d1a6ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/525b575ca7fb0954aa9cb46c5b07091b17d1a6ff/0_0_3072_2064/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Cole scores for Manchester United against Blackburn in November 1998.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"672\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andy Cole scores for Manchester United against Blackburn in November 1998.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cole\u2019s current isolation has made him understand how much he needs the support of his friends: \u201cA couple of my mates popped around the other day, and I spoke to them outside at a safe distance. They came all the way from south London and I couldn\u2019t ask them in. This is where we\u2019re at now.\u201d</p> <p>As a consequence, Cole says: \u201cMy mind never stops going. I\u2019ve had a lot of restless nights. So there\u2019s a hell of a lot of tiredness. I worry about having to go through another transplant. My new kidney could stop working tomorrow so I ask myself all the time: \u2018Could you do it again?\u2019 Some days it\u2019s \u2018Oh yes\u2019 and other days I\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p> <p>Cole offers further insight into his health problems when he reveals: \u201cLast year I had about six chest infections. On Boxing Day I was rushed into hospital. I didn\u2019t feel well after I got back from the Man U-Newcastle game. I was really, really cold. My mate told me to call the doctor. I ended up going to hospital in an ambulance. They were running tests on me, believing I had liver cancer. That was a real body blow.\u201d</p> <p>Fortunately he was cleared of cancer but Cole says he still has to overcome his reticence to open up and admit his vulnerability. He nods when I say he is speaking with admirable honesty today. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten a little easier. I\u2019m more prepared to talk about it with my mates. If you\u2019re thinking of giving up on life it just leads you to destruction. But I\u2019ve always wanted to do things by myself. And when I can\u2019t do them, I struggle. I\u2019m not someone who likes to ask for help. I feel like I\u2019m burdening people \u2013 even though everyone always says, \u2018Never, ever feel like that.\u2019 It\u2019s still very foreign to me.</p> <p>\u201cI know I can\u2019t do it by myself, even if some days, like last Wednesday, I tell myself, \u2018Man, you\u2019re here alone. Get through today and start another day tomorrow.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9957b154d0e67b87319c5854f73cc0fdfc18d98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9957b154d0e67b87319c5854f73cc0fdfc18d98/0_0_2048_1471/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Cole keeps hold of the Champions League trophy as Manchester United parade their treble-winning silverware in 1999.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"718\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andy Cole keeps hold of the Champions League trophy as Manchester United parade their treble-winning silverware in 1999.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Russell Boyce/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Does Cole also sometimes acknowledge how well he has done since he fell ill five years ago? \u201cWell, I ask myself: \u2018How have you done it? From going down with the illness to having a transplant to where you are now.\u2019 I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ve done it. Some days are a total blur. But my mates say that the improvement I\u2019ve made in the last 18 months has been unbelievable. They take their hats off to me. They say: \u2018You\u2019re a lot stronger than you think.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Cole\u2019s desire to set up the kidney research fund was deepened by a trip last year to the <a href=\"http://worldtransplantgames.org/\" title=\"\">World Transplant Games</a> in Newcastle where he was \u201cmoved to tears\u201d while talking to patients who had experienced the same trauma. Some were playing football again. Could Cole imagine himself doing the same one day \u2013 even if the man who has scored the third highest amount of <a href=\"https://www.statbunker.com/alltimestats/AllTimeLeadingScorers?comp_code=EPL\" title=\"\">goals in Premier League history</a> would have to accept a huge drop in playing standards among fellow transplant patients?</p> <p>\u201cSome days I say \u2018I\u2019d love to\u2019, and some days I\u2019m not sure. But if it came around again and I had the opportunity, I think I would go for it.\u201d</p> <p>Cole looks so much brighter and he smiles again when I ask him if he feels any sympathy for Liverpool as they are so close to winning the league title that has eluded them for 30 years \u2013 only for the season to be in lockdown? \u201cI can\u2019t be biased. If Manchester United were in this situation I would be bitterly disappointed. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool\" title=\"\">Liverpool</a> have every right to be bitterly disappointed. They deserve to be called champions.\u201d</p> <p>But football seems insignificant when set against the struggle Cole faces. \u201cIt\u2019s a rollercoaster,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut I continue to give it a good go and fight as hard as I can do. You have to try and feel optimistic for the future. I\u2019ve got to face the reality but try and stay as positive as I can. But, when I\u2019m here alone, I have time to think.

  "<p>In the space of a week in April, Mississippi, US, was hit by four separate tornadoes. Three of these occurred on Easter Sunday and brought damaging winds reaching 190mph. These left one person dead and another injured, as well as damaging many homes and mobile homes. A week later, on 19 April, another tornado brought winds of up to 170mph to southern Mississippi, creating a total of 227 miles of damage through the state in the course of a week.</p> <p>Records were broken last week when, on 25 April, a tropical depression formed in the eastern Pacific Ocean, almost three weeks before the official start of the eastern Pacific hurricane season. The depression occurred far out at sea, south-west of Mexico, and didn\u2019t make landfall. However, this is the earliest ever recorded formation of a tropical depression in the ocean basin since records began in 1966.</p> <p>Another record was broken this month when Cuba recorded its highest temperature since records began. On 12 April temperatures reached 39.3C in the town of Veguitas. This was mainly due to a strong high pressure system and light winds allowing for heat to become trapped at the surface. The previous record had been 39.1 degrees, recorded last year on 30 June.</p>",

These are an artwork: The Alice Walls, created for the centre\u2019s opening in 1982.</p> <p>The work\u2019s feel of the early Russian avant garde \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/jul/04/kazimir-malevich-liberated-painting-tate\">Kazimir Malevich</a>, say \u2013 is no coincidence. Gillian Wise, its creator, who has died aged 84 after contracting Covid-19, was a member of a group of artists known as the British constructivists. Founded by <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-victor-pasmore-1141076.html\">Victor Pasmore</a> in the early 1950s, they challenged the dominance of American abstraction with a return to the rational geometry of prewar Europe. Wise confessed herself mystified at the stairwell commission. \u201cIt was certainly contrary to the prevailing prejudice of the art establishment,\u201d she recalled <a href=\"http://www.saturationpoint.org.uk/Gillian_Wise_interview.html\">in an interview</a> in 2017.</p> <p>This was true. She had first been approached by the Barbican\u2019s architects in 1979. By the time The Alice Walls was unveiled, it seemed glaringly out of fashion. Although she was the only British artist to have installed work at the new centre, Wise received no acknowledgment for it and was not invited to the Barbican\u2019s opening. It was, she said, \u201ca dark episode in the annals of support for national artists and, of course, women\u201d. In 1984, she left Britain, first for the US and then France and, bar the odd visit, never returned.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"48b177a052015efad3375501663137ec6c5e6683\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48b177a052015efad3375501663137ec6c5e6683/0_0_1333_2000/667.jpg\" alt=\"Gillian Wise\u2019s large-scale artwork The Alice Walls, 1982, at the Barbican Centre in London.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gillian Wise\u2019s large-scale artwork The Alice Walls, 1982, at the Barbican Centre in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Yee</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her attachment to the Soviet model of art-making had begun long before. Born in Ilford, east London, to Arthur Wise, a Thames timber merchant, and his wife, Elsie (nee Holden), a milliner, Gillian was educated locally and went to art school at 18 \u2013 first to Wimbledon School of Art, from 1954 to 1957, and then to the Central School of Arts and Crafts in 1959. By graduation, she was already showing with the British constructivists. In 1961 she became the group\u2019s youngest member.</p> <p>By then, though, the idea of a geometric abstraction that was in some way political \u2013 and, more specifically, aligned to the left \u2013 had come to seem both out of date and faintly dangerous. Like others of the group, Wise was taken up by Drian, a gallery founded by a Lithuanian refugee, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2008/nov/20/1\">Halima Nalecz</a>, to show work spurned by the blue-chip dealers of Mayfair.</p> <p>In 1959 she had met <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/anthony-hill-1284\">Anthony Hill</a>, a fellow Drian constructivist: the two would be romantically and professionally linked throughout the 60s. In 1963, they exhibited jointly in a show called Reliefs/Structures at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London. They also worked collaboratively, Metal Relief with Horizontal Elements (1962), now in the collection of the National Galleries of Scotland, being typical of their output. In 1965, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/mar/09/sir-howard-hodgkin-obituary\">Howard Hodgkin</a> painted the pair in a double portrait, <a href=\"https://howard-hodgkin.com/artwork/anthony-hill-and-gillian-wise\">Anthony Hill and Gillian Wise</a>.</p> <p>In 1969, however, Wise won a British Council scholarship to research the history of Russian constructivism in the Soviet Union. While in Leningrad, she met and married a Moldavian architect called Adrian Ciobotaru; they later had a son, Alexander. In 1969, too, Wise showed in an exhibition in Helsinki organised by the British abstractionist <a href=\"http://www.jeffreysteele.co.uk/\">Jeffrey Steele</a>. When Steele invited participants to form the Systems group that December, Wise quit the constructivists to join it.</p> <p>The years that followed were to be the most successful of her career. Systems art was sufficiently broad-church to be unrestrictive and yet unifying: artists settled on a system \u2013 geometric, conceptual, colouristic \u2013 and used it to generate work. Wise showed in the group\u2019s defining exhibitions, including Systems at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/whitechapel-gallery\">Whitechapel Gallery</a>, London, in 1972 and Systems II at the Polytechnic of Central London the following year. However, the group fell apart in 1975, on disagreements over its position on Marxism.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e776502b33a8a11b5859ba9db6abce58e05bec8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e776502b33a8a11b5859ba9db6abce58e05bec8/0_0_2644_2644/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ginger Rose, acrylic on canvas, 2000, by Gillian Wise.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ginger Rose, acrylic on canvas, 2000, by Gillian Wise</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gillian Wise</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Following her divorce from Ciobotaru in 1980 and the debacle of The Alice Walls, there was little to keep Wise in Britain. After a two-year fellowship at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Centre for Advanced Visual Studies (1982-84) and a spell teaching in Chicago, she moved permanently to Paris. There, she found herself in a double bind. Although Wise and London had turned mutual backs on each other, her history and connections were in the capital. While the French were receptive to the intellectual underpinnings of her work, this did not translate into shows.</p> <p>The next four decades were precarious, Wise having to give up sculpture for painting for lack of a studio. Most of her pre-Paris work had been lost or destroyed, and so her role in British abstraction grew overlooked. Her Red series of paintings, begun in 2002 and unfinished at her death, suggest an extraordinary maturing of eye and mind. To date, they remain largely unseen.</p> <p>As a student at Wimbledon, Wise had travelled to Ulm to meet the Swiss abstractionist <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/artists/559\">Max Bill</a>. On another trip, to Paris, she met the Belgian artist and founder member of the De Stijl group <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/georges-vantongerloo-2094\">Georges Vantongerloo</a>: from him, she kept a letter saying how moved he had been by her work. She saw herself as a torchbearer for a specifically European modernism in a day when modernism and Europe were out of fashion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f81121b19164773b8722fc954d52b04570ca85f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f81121b19164773b8722fc954d52b04570ca85f3/0_0_2005_1581/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Winged Net, neon version, 1970-71, by Gillian Wise\" width=\"1000\" height=\"789\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Winged Net, neon version, 1970-71, by Gillian Wise</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gillian Wise</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As time passed, Wise grew more fixed in her belief that American art had triumphed not through genius but through institutional backhanders, some of them from the CIA. She made her case in a book, Low Frequency, self-published in 2003. \u201cAfter a while one learnt to say little,\u201d Wise wrote of her view. \u201c[Otherwise] the outside world, including some insiders, would think you unbalanced.\u201d</p> <p>It was only later in her life that the world grew more tolerant of Wise\u2019s uncompromising stance. In 2006, a geometric abstractionist, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/dec/06/art.turnerprize2006\">Tomma Abts</a>, won the Turner prize. In 2010, Wise\u2019s work was included in the Tate Britain show Construction England; in 2017, in British Constructivism at Pallant House gallery, Chichester. The Drawing Room gallery\u2019s 2019 Drawing Biennial featured a work by the artist Andrew Bick called <a href=\"https://drawingroom.org.uk/drawingbiennial2019/drawing/drawing-for-gillian-wise-1\">Drawing for Gillian Wise #1</a>. And, in 2004, The Alice Walls, threatened with destruction, was saved after public outcry. Ten years later, a small plaque was finally affixed to the work, naming Wise as its maker.</p> <p>She is survived by Alexander and her granddaughter, Audrey.</p> <p>\u2022 Gillian Mary Wise, artist, born 16 February 1936; died 11 April 2020</p>",
  "<p>Covid-19 has accomplished in weeks something that UK governments spent a decade failing to do. It has drastically cut labour migration. Lockdown prevents the gathering of real-time data, but it is a reasonable assumption when international travel has stopped that net migration is currently happening at a rate well below 100,000 per year.</p> <p>That was the target <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/26/the-failure-of-david-camerons-migration-policy-has-been-spectacular\" title=\"\">adopted by David Cameron</a> in 2010 and pursued aggressively by Theresa May at the Home Office and in Downing Street. It was never met before being abandoned last year. What happens next is uncertain. This week would have seen the government\u2019s post-Brexit <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/landmark-immigration-bill-to-end-free-movement-introduced-to-parliament\" title=\"\">immigration bill</a> return to the Commons, but the timetable has been discarded, not least because parliament\u2019s digital systems are not yet ready for remote voting.</p> <p>There is no indication that ministers are reconsidering the new regime, which is based on a points system designed to select \u201cskilled\u201d workers over \u201cunskilled\u201d labour. The distinction is meant to favour what ministers call \u201cthe best and brightest\u201d while deterring those whom decades of political rhetoric have cast as undesirable. The charges against that latter group are various: poaching jobs from British-born citizens, depressing wages, failing to observe cultural norms and generally upsetting people with conspicuous otherness.</p> <p>The vilification reached its apogee in the campaign to take Britain out of the EU. The promise to \u201ctake back control\u201d of borders had strong emotional appeal, but was never rooted in the reality of modern Britain, where migrants of all skill levels and income brackets keep the economic and social wheels turning. That awkward fact was always bound to emerge over time, but it has been revealed abruptly by the pandemic.</p> <p>Farmers are already warning that fruit will rot in the fields without seasonal labour normally provided by EU citizens. Attempts to entice UK workers to fill the gap are failing. Immigrants have kept public transport running, delivered goods and, most poignantly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/08/the-nhs-needs-them-uk-urged-to-join-countries-mobilising-migrant-medics\" title=\"\">kept the NHS and social care services operational</a>. They have put their lives at risk for a country that has been, at best, ambivalent about their entitlement to live here at all.</p> <p>There is no longer an explicit commitment to make Britain a \u201chostile environment\u201d for immigrants, but the apparatus of automatic suspicion and bureaucratic bullying developed under that rubric has not gone away. An appeal court this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/28/hostile-environment-appeal-court-judges-landlords-tenants\" title=\"\">upheld the law</a> obliging landlords to check the immigration status of tenants, despite an earlier finding by the high court that the rules led to discrimination on racial grounds. Many immigrant workers, already in precarious employment or on visas that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/labour-urges-give-migrants-benefits-lockdown\" title=\"\">prohibit access to benefits</a>, will suffer disproportionately from the economic impact of the pandemic.</p> <p>It would be shameful if the heroic contribution and sacrifices made by immigrants in these difficult times were met with callous ingratitude by the government. Fallacies and prejudices that have informed UK policy for a generation are being exposed by the current crisis. The debate has been oriented in entirely the wrong direction, with all the emphasis on a burden that should more rightly be understood as a blessing. It will not be easy to reverse that trend, but the opportunity is there if our politicians have the honesty and the courage to take it.</p>",

Now the figures include people who have died in any setting having tested positive for coronavirus. Today\u2019s figure is 26,097. The government dashboard, with the details, is <a href=\"https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/\">here.</a> But there are still good grounds for thinking that this figure massively understates the true extent of coronavirus deaths, because so many people are dying without being tested.

Gove is one of the ministers who attends the daily C-19 meeting in Downing Street, which is referred to by insiders as the coronavirus \u201cwar cabinet\u201d, and he chairs<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-government-structures-to-coordinate-response-to-coronavirus\"> a coronavirus implementation committee</a> in charge of \u201cpreparedness\u201d across much of the public sector and critical national infrastructure, excluding the NHS.</p> \n  <p>In an <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/28/exclusive-ministers-warned-nhs-could-not-cope-pandemic-three/\">exclusive report</a> on Exercise Cygnus published at the end of March, the Sunday Telegraph said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The NHS failed a major cross-government test of its ability to handle a severe pandemic but the \u201cterrifying\u201d results were kept secret from the public.</p> \n   <p>Ministers were informed three years ago that Britain would be quickly overwhelmed by a severe outbreak amid a shortage of critical care beds, morgue capacity and personal protective equipment (PPE), an investigation has discovered ... </p> \n   <p>Despite the failings exposed by Cygnus, the government never changed its strategic roadmap for a future pandemic, with the last update carried out in 2014. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Summarising <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/28/exercise-cygnus-uncovered-pandemic-warnings-buried-government/\">the conclusions from the exercise </a>in the Sunday Telegraph, <strong>Paul Nuki </strong>and <strong>Bill Gardner</strong> said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>But it was not the pandemic itself that was causing those gathered in Whitehall to grimace but the nation\u2019s woeful preparation. The peak of the epidemic had not yet arrived but local resilience forums, hospitals and mortuaries across the country were already being overwhelmed. </p> \n   <p>There was not enough personal protective equipment (PPE) for the nation\u2019s doctors and nurses. The NHS was about to \u201cfall over\u201d due to a shortage of ventilators and critical care beds. Morgues were set to overflow, and it had become terrifyingly evident that the government\u2019s emergency messaging was not getting traction with the public.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Gove told the committee he had read the report. But, when pressed by the committee\u2019s chairman <strong>William Wragg</strong> as to when he had read it, he said last week.</p> \n  <p>When Wragg expressed surprise about this, Gove said: \u201cSome of the product that flowed from that report I had read beforehand.\u201d Asked what he was referring to, Gove said he was referring to recommendations relating to the need for emergency legislation, to the risk of the NHS being overwhelmed and to the need to de-prioritise non-urgent operations.</p> \n  <p>Gove said the report had led to the development of an influenza pandemic stockpile. But Exercise Cygnus specifically covered a flu pandemic, and Gove said the fact that coronavirus was a different sort of virus meant that there was a need for \u201ca recalibration of our approach towards PPE [personal protective equipment]\u201d.

It was as if the two protagonists were trying to outbid each other in evidence-based discourse and common sensical decency. It is very likely to be the case that debates in cabinet ministerial committees get more unpleasant and abrasive than what we witnessed at PMQs today. If Raab was getting rattled, he only really let it show right at the end, when he sought to lecture Starmer (mildly) on being opportunistic. Ironically, this was probably the point at which Raab\u2019s argument - that an \u201cexit strategy\u201d of the kind published by the Scottish government at all isn\u2019t really an exit strategy, because it does not commit to policy - was at its strongest. Raab did not really have much of an answer to Starmer\u2019s question earlier about how the PPE problems were going to be fixed. Starmer probably had the better of the exchanges, although it did not sound like the convention PMQs \u201cwin\u201d, not least because his performance included gushing praise for the government\u2019s performance on boosting NHS capacity. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/29/uk-coronavirus-live-priti-patel-questions-response-covid-19-crisis-pmqs-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ea963518f08db9df42df808#block-5ea963518f08db9df42df808\">12.24pm.)</a></p> \n  <p>This might not be what people are used to at PMQs, but there is probably method in Starmer\u2019s approach. It was strongly reminiscent of what <strong>Tony Blair</strong> wrote about how to succeed at PMQs in his memoirs. Blair wrote:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I always tried to make [what he said at PMQs] telling. The aim was to get the non-politician nodding. I would wonder not what appealed to a Labour party conference in full throttle, but what would appeal to my old mates at the Bar, who wanted a reasonable case to be made; and who, if it were made, would rally ...</p> \n   <p>Yes, it\u2019s not like calling your opponent a liar, or a fraud, or a villain or a hypocrite, but the middle-ground floating voters kind of shrugs their shoulders at those claims. They don\u2019t chime. They\u2019re too over the top, too heavy, and they represent an insult, not an argument. Whereas the lesser charge, because it\u2019s more accurate and precisely because it\u2019s low-key, can stick.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea96f578f08db9df42df8b4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-29T12:18:00.535Z\">1.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Starmer says UK risks 'falling behind' if government does not publish exit plan</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here are quote from the final exchanges at PMQs between <strong>Dominic Raab</strong> and <strong>Sir Keir Starmer</strong>, where Starmer was claiming the UK would fall behind other countries if it did not publish an exit plan soon. Starmer said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>France, Germany, Spain, Belgium, New Zealand, Australia, Scotland and Wales have all published exit plans of one sort or another. [Raab] said, \u2018well what are the proposals, what should they cover?\u2019. If you look at those plans, as he\u2019s done and I\u2019ve done, it\u2019s clear that there are common issues such as schools reopening, business sectors reopening.</p> \n   <p>These are the issues that, if he wants me to put them on the table, I absolutely will.</p> \n   <p>Delay risks not only falling behind other countries, but also the successful four-nation approach so far.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Raab said it would be wrong to publish an exit plan before the scientific advice said it was safe to start relaxing the lockdown. And he said the Scottish government had not published one. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The Scottish government has not set out an exit strategy.

The numbers are likely to be significant underestimates due to suspected underreporting and differing testing and recording systems around the world.

Though the society is closed to the public during the pandemic, the online version shows a selection of curated artworks, which will be on view until 24 October.</p> <p>The first part of the exhibition looks at roughly 80 artworks from the historic collection of California-based cartoonist and collector Trina Robbins. Her collection includes cartoons by women in the flapper era, the second world war and 1950s romance comics, among others. Robbins has single-handedly rediscovered an entire generation of artists, some of whom are only now being recognized.</p> <p>Case in point: the 20th-century cartoonist <a href=\"https://www.comic-con.org/awards/eisner-awards-current-info\">Nell Brinkley</a> \u2013 whose Brinkley Girl comic is part of the exhibition \u2013 is one of the inductees of this year\u2019s Will Eisner Hall of Fame award, roughly one century after her artwork was made.</p> <p>Her collection also includes the work of Rose O\u2019Neill, who was an American cartoonist known for her Kewpie cartoons, which were published in Ladies\u2019 Home Journal in the early 1900s. It led to the production of Kewpie dolls (she was also active in the suffrage movement), a time before Walt Disney created Mickey Mouse in 1928.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82c3812b3a311fe3392bd051b836cfef3b3c2ec9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82c3812b3a311fe3392bd051b836cfef3b3c2ec9/0_0_750_705/500.jpg\" alt=\"Work by Ethel Hays.\" width=\"500\" height=\"470\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Work from Ethel Hays.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Trina Robbins</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe first comic I found was by Rose O\u2019Neill from 1896,\u201d said Robbins, whose forthcoming book is called <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Flapper-Queens-Women-Cartoonists-Jazz/dp/1683963237\">The Flapper Queens: Women Cartoonists </a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Flapper-Queens-Women-Cartoonists-Jazz/dp/1683963237\">of </a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Flapper-Queens-Women-Cartoonists-Jazz/dp/1683963237\">the Jazz Age</a>. \u201cI have the magazine it appeared in, not the original art. Until anyone finds anything earlier, it\u2019s the first published woman comic.\u201d</p> <p>Robbins started in the San Francisco underground comics scene in 1966. \u201cI didn\u2019t know about the women who preceded me,\u201d she said. In the early 198os, she and fellow artist Catherine Yronwode collaborated on an idea: \u201cI decided we needed to produce a history of women cartoonists,\u201d said Robbins. \u201cWe made a book in 1985.\u201d</p> <p>The exhibition details the romance comics women created while men were out fighting in the war, they then took jobs for adventure cartoons, but when men returned home, women lost all their jobs.</p> <p>It caused many of them to be erased from comics history. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve written my books and collected my collection,\u201d said Robbins. \u201cThey were forgotten. My big epiphany when writing these books, is that if you\u2019re not written about, you\u2019re forgotten. They\u2019re not forgotten any more, they\u2019re not.

  "<p>UK Home Office efforts to deport an HIV-positive Zimbabwean man because of his lengthy criminal record have been blocked after the supreme court ruled removing him would breach his human rights.</p> <p>Sending the 33-year-old man, identified only as AM, back to Zimbabwe would deny him access to life-saving treatment with the anti-retroviral medication Eviplera, the court unanimously accepted. The drug is not available there.</p> <p>The case has been sent back to the lower courts for reconsideration.</p> <p>AM was born in Zimbabwe in 1987 and came to the UK in 2000. He and his mother, who had already been living in Britain, were granted indefinite leave to remain in 2004.</p> <p>In the following years, he accumulated convictions for battery, assault, receiving stolen goods and twice for possession of a blade in public. In 2006, the Home Office first made an order to deport him. He has since married and had a son.</p> <p>Three years later, he was convicted of further serious offences including possession of a firearm and heroin with intent to supply. He was jailed for nine years.</p> <p>In 2012 his lawyers challenged the Home Office deportation order, submitting evidence that he had first been diagnosed with HIV in 2003 but that he had not become seriously ill until later.</p> <p>The first anti-retroviral drug produced severe side effects. When he was switched to Eviplera his blood count increased and he recovered.</p> <p>Opening the judgment, Lord Wilson said: \u201cThis appeal requires the court again to consider one of the most controversial questions which the law of human rights can generate.</p> <p>\u201cIt relates to the ability of the UK to deport a foreign citizen who, while lawfully resident here, has committed a string of serious crimes. The reaction of many British citizens is likely to be: \u2018We don\u2019t want this man here.\u2019 His response is: \u2018But I need to remain here.\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>AM originally appealed against removal on the grounds that it would breach article 8 of the European convention on human rights, which guarantees the right to private and family life.</p> <p>A recent test case against Belgium at the European court of human Rights in Strasbourg established the principle that under article 3 of the convention, which outlaws torture and inhuman treatment, those with serious ill health cannot forcibly be removed to another country if they would suffer there a substantial reduction in life expectancy.</p> <p>The appeal court was bound by legal precedent and could not permit the claim to switch from article 8 to article 3. The supreme court, however, can do so.</p> <p>Delivering judgment, Wilson said: \u201cThis is not one of those highly exceptional situations in which we should decline to follow a decision of the Strasbourg court.</p> <p>\u201cWe therefore allow the appeal and remit the appellant\u2019s proposed claim under article 3 for consideration by an immigration tribunal, which will no doubt seek to conduct a full inquiry into (among other things) the adequacy of the medical treatment likely to be available to the appellant in Zimbabwe.\u201d</p>",

Another, wearing no shoes, claims she was told she\u2019d receive a fine for being in the city centre.</p> <p>Rough sleepers with dependency issues often rely on begging and shoplifting to fund their addictions. Both of those avenues are now closed to them. Now could indeed be a golden opportunity to help these people, but only if the political will, money and support staff are there. For homeless addicts forced to detox because they can\u2019t access their regular supplies, they need far more support than ever.</p> <p>This support would normally come from the charities and third-sector organisations now facing collapse \u2013 it has been estimated that charities will <a href=\"https://www.charitytimes.com/ct/coronavirus-charities-could-miss-out-on-billions-over-next-12-weeks.php\">miss out on at least \u00a34.3bn of income </a>over a 12-week period because of a shortfall in fundraising and the closure of their shops. This is of course terrible, but perhaps the pandemic will force us to accept that charities are not the solution to chronic social problems. However well intentioned homelessness charities are, they are compromised from the start \u2013 without homelessness, they won\u2019t exist. You could make the same argument about hospitals and sick people of course, but only if you think homelessness is as inescapable as illness.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/sep/24/the-homeless-death-of-jake-humm-it-was-my-deepest-darkest-fear\">The homeless death of Jake Humm: 'It was my deepest, darkest fear'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The obvious alternative is to have all these services under one public umbrella so that their clients\u2019 needs \u2013 housing, substance abuse, mental health and employment \u2013 can be addressed simultaneously.</p> <p>Although the causes of homelessness are varied and wildly complex, the solutions are relatively simple.

  "<p>To a Texan, the idea of a meat-free chilli may seem as nonsensical as a vegetarian rag\u00f9 bolognese would to an Italian \u2013<a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/food/cooking/2018/02/22/the-best-real-texas-chili-recipes-no-beans-allowed/\"> purists</a> won\u2019t even allow their beef to be contaminated with beans, let alone replaced by it. Just like bolognese, however, chilli is treated with less respect outside its homeland \u2013 the quick weekday suppers on which many of us grew up \u2013 full of mince, tinned tomatoes and kidney beans - are easy to adapt to a plant-based diet. But is it possible to replicate the real thing, with its complex spicing and unapologetically meaty, savoury flavour, without the meat?</p> <p>(My first port of call is the <a href=\"https://www.chilicookoff.com\">International Chili Society</a>, which puts me in touch with Henry Stephens, the most recent winner of the vegetarian category of its annual competition. He very kindly sends me his recipe, which turns out to be a white chilli, a spin-off generally made with chicken, and that contains cauliflower, corn and copious amounts of dairy. Here I\u2019m looking for what might be termed \u201ca bowl of red\u201d, but it\u2019s good to know there are other possibilities out there, when ingredients such as <em>queso blanco</em> might be more widely available.)</p> <h2>If not meat, then what?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7aeabec5644377079bb572cad74c00a2473b9cba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7aeabec5644377079bb572cad74c00a2473b9cba/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marie Lafore\u0302t\u2019s veg chilli uses soya mince.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marie Lafore\u0302t\u2019s soya mince-based take on the Tex-Mex staple.

It\u2019s not an ingredient I\u2019ve cooked with before, and I\u2019m pleasantly surprised by the results \u2013 once rehydrated and simmered in a richly flavoured sauce, I imagine most people wouldn\u2019t notice the difference, though as we\u2019re on lockdown, I\u2019m unable to check (it doesn\u2019t, however, fool the dog).</p> <p>The Guardian\u2019s own <a href=\"https://www.eatyourbooks.com/library/recipes/1518272/30-minute-sweet-potato-chilli\">Anna Jones</a> uses lentils and quinoa, both of which give her chilli good body, and aduki beans. In fact, everyone sticks in beans of some sort: kidney for Lafor\u00eat,<a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/01/best-vegetarian-bean-chile-recipe.html\"> Serious Eats\u2019 J Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt</a> and<a href=\"https://www.foodandwine.com/news/willie-nelsons-favorite-chili-recipe-vegan\"> chef Michel Nischan</a>, whose beanfest also includes pinto and black varieties, while L\u00f3pez-Alt also roughly crushes chickpeas to add textural contrast, and Nischan, who developed his recipe for country music star Willie Nelson\u2019s wife (the Nelsons apparently called it \u201cthe best f***ing chili we\u2019ve ever tasted\u201d), thickens it with posole, or<a href=\"https://www.ranchogordo.com/pages/how-to-cook-posole-prepared-hominy\"> dried nixtamalised corn</a>, soaked overnight, which is a great idea, <a href=\"https://www.coolchile.co.uk/shop-mexican-food/maize-kernels-for-pozolehominy\">if you can find it</a> here.</p> <p>Interestingly, though most of these recipes are slow cooked, which means there\u2019s plenty of time for softening the beans, only my friend Wendy Tien,<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/upstartkitchen/?__tn__=kCH-R&amp;eid=ARD2NOZkdb9ZOdeMMIBKu2NMqEABTqxR_4Gq7JEWTiuK_Dmt3Q7DVtetNo6yNMvcymjhU1D3YATQCA2J&amp;hc_ref=ARRM5JGO0gTI4L6px_d9ExUcL8K_vEFpyvHoww2_FClJateYJXnFvqo43DV4s_0puz0&amp;fref=nf&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARA5wwkcecWAq4BnXW1aabQOp0vTCq2nxSeI_2VN2pyoKM9NNeKxaiZGBPVHW8XkxWKC1AoAGWpPDTLPhy2k2gnA41gflYql95w9xnTaiC0tlrI6Gs5QHJm35fD6hghhdwL1CXApbibFfbacc253WgbKkFW4bgA_iQlDGSp3YsG3v_FYR-aSO2vMTWchBZgmebq-uvWFR_RcNVeNt_FAvBDACd8dw75RB4hc-t-yJXbHrV1L_5p0ZawsCZkgYFCZcyQ7cdJdEHt0RNFCySxCh6ARjJj61M8naAslYa3aFA1-5vTeIMClmBxEtx3WiCeWa861JMY_Ya3SWRV3\"> a judge and keen home cook from Wisconsin</a> (not peak chilli country, admittedly, but a damned sight closer than here) recommends the dried kind (just about any sort is fine, in her opinion).<a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/2012/01/best-vegetarian-bean-chili.html\"> L\u00f3pez-Alt</a> concedes that they can be bland, but says, \u201ccanned beans are a sure thing. They\u2019re never over or undercooked, they\u2019re never bloated or busted. They are lacking in the flavour department, but with a good simmer in a very flavourful liquid, you can easily make up for this.\u201d He does note, however, that, thanks to the acidic tomatoes common in vegetable chilli, beans soften particularly slowly, which allows them to absorb flavour without turning to mush \u2013 not that I mind a few of them breaking down to help thicken the sauce.</p> <p>I like the earthy flavour of black beans and the sweeter, fluffier notes of kidney beans, but use whatever you prefer, or can find. Not only are dried beans a lot cheaper than tinned, but if you\u2019re going to slow-cook the chilli anyway, you may as well go the whole hog and soak some beans first. That said, if you really don\u2019t have time, or can\u2019t be bothered, swap the amount below for two 400g tins and cook the chilli until the gravy has reduced to your satisfaction.</p> <h2>Vegetables</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d9b317f325e6fb31100b572ddb5053aeb1f8eb8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9b317f325e6fb31100b572ddb5053aeb1f8eb8a/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michel Nischan\u2019s veg chilli: good enough for Willie Nelson\u2019s wife.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michel Nischan\u2019s version was originally devised for country singer Willie Nelson\u2019s wife.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If traditional chillies avoid meat, they\u2019re positively allergic to the idea of vegetables, apart from obvious aromatics such as onions. Fortunately, as we\u2019ve already scared all of them off at the first mention of soya mince, there\u2019s no need to worry about such nonsense; vegetables can add both nutrition and, perhaps more importantly, contrasting textures and flavours. Lafor\u00eat and Nischan both chuck in diced carrot, and the latter adds parsnips and poblano peppers for good measure, too, Jones goes for big chunks of sweet potato and roasted red peppers, Tien fresh peppers of any colour, and Lafor\u00eat adds a tin of sweetcorn to underline that institutional catering vibe. Because I\u2019d like to keep this as close to the traditional recipe as possible, I\u2019m just adding a green pepper, because I think the slightly bitter herbaceousness works well with Tex-Mex flavours, but if you hate the things, feel free to use another colour, or indeed stick in any other vegetables you fancy \u2013 Jones\u2019s sweet potato is a particular hit.</p> <h2>Spicing</h2> <p>As L\u00f3pez-Alt notes, \u201cgreat chili has to start with great chilies\u201d, and this applies whether you\u2019re making it with brisket or black beans, so it rules out the European recipes that depend on cayenne pepper or paprika for their heat. It may sound obvious, but chillies are a fruit, and just as pointed green peppers you get in kebabs taste different from sweet red Italian ones, they come in a wide spectrum of flavours. Most generic chilli powders are just about heat, which is why more complex recipes call for specific varieties, usually sold whole, which are toasted to bring out their flavour before grinding. Smoky chipotles are popular, whether dried, in a paste or in a tangy adobo sauce \u2013 the last can easily be found online.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"60aedf7d00bf4bc0029b67d2c693e28e0f13b321\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60aedf7d00bf4bc0029b67d2c693e28e0f13b321/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wendy Tien\u2019s veggie chilli: a mix of sweet and hot chillies.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wendy Tien\u2019s version features a mix of sweet and hot chillies.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tien and L\u00f3pez-Alt both aim for a balance of flavours and heats, using a mixture of sweet chillies such as costeno, New Mexico and choricero, fruity ancho, mulatto, negro, guajillo or pasillas, and hot ones such as arbol or cascabel, giving their vegetarian chillies a well-rounded warmth, rather than a fiery heat. I\u2019ve tried not to be too prescriptive below; bear in mind that bigger supermarkets now sell a few Mexican varieties, which you can play around with, but you\u2019ll probably still need to plan ahead and buy online \u2013 they last for ages. Nischan notes that \u201cthe key to this recipe is<a href=\"https://www.souschef.co.uk/blogs/the-bureau-of-taste/how-to-cook-with-mexican-chillies\"> cooking the chile peppers Mexican-style \u2013 toasting, blooming, rehydrating and pureeing</a>\u201d, a step also embraced by L\u00f3pez-Alt to get the most flavour out of them, and well worth the slight faff for the payoff in flavour.</p> <p>Of course, chillies aren\u2019t the only spice involved; almost everyone includes what I think of as the classic Mexican pairing of cumin and coriander, while Mexican oregano, a member of the verbena family, with a more citrussy, sweeter flavour, is also popular. Those who don\u2019t use chilli are likely to add paprika instead, but unless you can\u2019t find chipotle in any form, this is unnecessary \u2013 if so, however, the smoked kind might come in useful.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9c020d0f6413d96bb55aabb915480c62c9ba0485\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c020d0f6413d96bb55aabb915480c62c9ba0485/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"J Kenji Lo\u0301pez-Alt\u2019s veg chilli is the inspiration for the use of Marmite.

I find garlic powder overpowering, so I\u2019m going to stick to finely chopped cloves. Laforet and Nischan also add sugar, and the latter vinegar, too \u2013 this is entirely a matter of taste, so if you think it needs a little dark sugar or a splash of acidity, go ahead.</p> <p>The thing you can\u2019t get from beans, of course, is the savoury flavour of red meat \u2013 the recipes offer various replacements, from soy sauce to nutritional yeast, but the simplest, and best in my opinion, is L\u00f3pez-Alt\u2019s Marmite, though haters could go for soy sauce instead.</p> <h2>The sauce</h2> <p>The quicker chilli recipes tend to rely on tinned tomatoes as their liquid, but for slower-cooked versions, more is needed if it\u2019s not to become a spicy tomato stew. Lafor\u00eat adds vegetable stock, but something with a bit more oomph is required \u2013 L\u00f3pez-Alt whizzes up his chillies with water, and Tien recommends beer, but I\u2019m going for coffee, whose dark, bitter flavour I also used in my<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2011/may/12/cook-perfect-chilli-con-carne\"> beef chilli</a>, having stolen the idea from Jamie Oliver.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c259946220497d8ac3c89b390f80894906310ab8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c259946220497d8ac3c89b390f80894906310ab8/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Jones\u2019 veggie chilli uses lentils and quinoa.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anna Jones\u2019 veggie chilli features lentils and quinoa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s common to thicken the sauce with some masa, or fine nixtamalised cornmeal of the kind used to make tortillas. I like this, particularly with beans, because it gives a consistency closer to the meat version, though if you don\u2019t have masa, you could use cornflour or fine ordinary cornmeal instead. L\u00f3pez-Alt finishes it with a slug of bourbon or vodka on the basis that \u201ccertain aromas are carried well with steam, while others are, in fact, carried better via vaporised alcohol\u201d, but having tasted it before and afterwards, my tastebuds aren\u2019t sensitive enough to notice the difference, so I\u2019d suggest saving the shot for pudding.</p> <h2>Serving suggestions</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"96f321451b42083c3814778621ce1737fa9393d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96f321451b42083c3814778621ce1737fa9393d9/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Felicity Cloake\u2019s perfect veg chilli, served with cornbread and avocado.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Felicity Cloake\u2019s perfect veggie chilli, served with cornbread and avocado.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>L\u00f3pez-Alt is right that the chilli tastes even better reheated the next day. He serves it with coriander, chopped onions and spring onions, avocado, lime wedges and corn tortillas, while Nischan leaves out the tortillas and avocado and adds cheese and soured cream. Jones makes a punchy coriander-and-lime drizzle, while Tien, who routinely finds my pairing of beef chilli with rice faintly hilarious, admits this version does need a starchy pairing if it\u2019s not to be heavy, admitting, \u201cI like it with spaghetti\u201d. Well, she is in the Midwest. I\u2019ll be honest, I enjoyed all the pairings \u2013 and cornbread or tortilla chips would also be very welcome, so take your pick.

I love this book. Lucy is a young woman fresh to New York City from Antigua \u2013 though <em>fresh </em>implies an innocence and simplicity of thought that this book rejects. There is such yearning in this slim novel, such inchoate desire. Lucy herself is not fully formed, and that\u2019s half the beauty. \u201cIn a daydream I used to have, all these places were points of happiness to me; all these places were lifeboats to my small drowning soul, for I would imagine myself entering and leaving them.\u201d</p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://www.boredtodeathbookclub.com/2015/07/30/goodbye-chunky-rice-by-craig-thompson/\">Good-bye Chunky Rice by Craig Thompson</a><br></strong>A turtle wants to leave home behind, and with it his best friend.

This is a quietly enthralling study of the brilliant physicist Su Lan, whose complex and often contradictory life is puzzled over by the people who knew her.</p> <p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/12/exit-west-mohsin-hamid-review-refugee-crisis\">Exit West by Mohsin Hamid</a><br></strong>There are books that make it their mission to shake the reader out of assumptions partway through, and Exit West is one such. What seems a typical, if well-written, contemporary realist love story takes a sharp turn once portals begin to open up, allowing people to cross into countries thousands of miles away. This book slyly undermines the ideas of borders and nationhood.</p> <p><strong>5. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/02/what-belongs-to-you-garth-greenwell-review\">What Belongs to You by Garth Greenwell</a><br></strong>The loneliness of living in another country, with all its attendant awkwardness and desire for physical contact, drives a novel that swallows its reader whole. Though I encountered this book during a hot summer, I remember feeling physically cold, so completely was I transported to the cramped apartments and dim streets of a morally ambiguous Sofia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a09364ba4d1185a0f67a54c4b935ff49fac3fd6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a09364ba4d1185a0f67a54c4b935ff49fac3fd6/0_72_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"the modern-day route travelled by the Joad family through Arizona in The Grapes of Wrath.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The modern-day route travelled in the 1930s through Arizona by the Joad family in The Grapes of Wrath.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>6. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-grapes-of-wrath-9780141185064.html\">The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck</a><br></strong>Steinbeck doesn\u2019t shy away from the ugliness of migration that is born of desperation. The travelling Joad family falls apart as its members move in search of work and stability \u2013 a mirror to the crumbling of the country in the wake of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_Bowl\">the Dust Bowl</a> of the 1930s.</p> <p><strong>7. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/22/the-shipping-news-proulx-newfoundland\">The Shipping News by Annie Proulx</a><br></strong>Bumbling, \u201cdamp loaf of a man\u201d Quoyle (what a name!) moves, after the dramatic death of his cheating wife, with two daughters into an ancestral home in icy Newfoundland. This book is a reminder that uprooting one\u2019s life is not only for the young and starry-eyed, not only for those who think they can carve from life one shiny, perfect jewel. Maybe it can be a more timid journey, the act of finding and accepting one\u2019s small craggy nest among the grimness.</p> <p><strong>8. <a href=\"http://www.jennymxie.com/eye-level.html\">Eye Level by Jenny Xie</a><br></strong>The speaker in Xie\u2019s poems passes through cities often known for their colourful appearances on vacation Instagrams, but there\u2019s no airiness or leisure in Eye Level. This collection feels a keen intellectual duty to parse apart the strangeness and morality, the privilege and isolation, that come with the ability to flit around the world.

I don\u2019t think I can say anything about this book more eloquent than it has to say for itself: \u201cIt was a kind of violence, what my father had done. He had brought us to a place we didn\u2019t belong, and taken us from a place we did.

I confess I found it too subtle; I may have used the word \u201cboring\u201d. Ten years later and some of these stories take my breath away; I feel them vibrate through my solar plexus. There is such wisdom and mature loveliness in Lahiri\u2019s pared-backed prose, an assurance that builds quietly to take the reader by surprise. I\u2019ve read the closing story, The Third and Final Continent, at least a dozen times. \u201cStill, there are times I am bewildered by each mile I have travelled, each meal I have eaten, each person I have known, each room in which I have slept.

  "<p>California advocates who have long worked to keep young men safe from gun violence are adapting their activities to deal with another pressing public health emergency that\u2019s disproportionately killing black Americans: Covid-19.</p> <p>Before the coronavirus outbreak, staff at the <a href=\"https://www.ci.richmond.ca.us/271/Office-of-Neighborhood-Safety\">Office </a><a href=\"https://www.ci.richmond.ca.us/271/Office-of-Neighborhood-Safety\">of Neighborhood </a><a href=\"https://www.ci.richmond.ca.us/271/Office-of-Neighborhood-Safety\">Safety</a> in the San Francisco Bay area city of Richmond worked with young men who were at risk of being caught up in the cycles of gun violence that have long rocked the community. The six outreach workers in the team counseled them, connected them with services, and intervened in local conflicts \u2013 all in an effort to prevent shootings and stop retaliatory gunfire.</p> <p>Richmond has seen at least 15 shooting incidents since the start of the stay-at-home orders that followed the coronavirus outbreak, including the first murder of the year and a triple shooting at a barbecue. Although the rate of gun violence in the city has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2019/jun/03/gun-violence-bay-area-drop-30-percent-why-investigation\">steadily declined</a> over the years, ONS staff says that the recent uptick coupled with new limits on in-person contact with the 37 fellows they work with is a tough adjustment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Guns%20and%20lies&amp;description=Gun%20homicides%20nationwide%20have%20barely%20declined%2C%20but%20in%20California%E2%80%99s%20Bay%20Area%20they%E2%80%99re%20down%2030%25.%20In%20a%20year-long%20series%2C%20the%20Guardian%20investigates%20the%20initiatives%20that%20are%20saving%20lives%20in%20an%20area%20scarred%20by%20rising%20inequality%20and%20gentrification&amp;read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2F&amp;links=true&amp;link-1-headline=Traumatized%20migrant%20kids%20were%20being%20shot.%20One%20school%20district%20came%20up%20with%20a%20plan%20to%20save%20them&amp;link-1-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2020%2Fapr%2F27%2Foakland-migrant-kids-murder-schools&amp;link-2-headline=92%25%20black%20or%20Latino%3A%20the%20California%20laws%20that%20keep%20minorities%20in%20prison&amp;link-2-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2019%2Fnov%2F26%2Fcalifornia-gang-enhancements-laws-black-latinos&amp;link-3-headline=Gun%20violence%20has%20sharply%20declined%20in%20California%E2%80%99s%20Bay%20Area.%20What%20happened%3F&amp;link-3-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2Fng-interactive%2F2019%2Fjun%2F03%2Fgun-violence-bay-area-drop-30-percent-why-investigation\" data-alt=\"Series linker\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&title=Guns%20and%20lies&description=Gun%20homicides%20nationwide%20have%20barely%20declined%2C%20but%20in%20California%E2%80%99s%20Bay%20Area%20they%E2%80%99re%20down%2030%25.%20In%20a%20year-long%20series%2C%20the%20Guardian%20investigates%20the%20initiatives%20that%20are%20saving%20lives%20in%20an%20area%20scarred%20by%20rising%20inequality%20and%20gentrification&read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2F&links=true&link-1-headline=Traumatized%20migrant%20kids%20were%20being%20shot.%20One%20school%20district%20came%20up%20with%20a%20plan%20to%20save%20them&link-1-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2020%2Fapr%2F27%2Foakland-migrant-kids-murder-schools&link-2-headline=92%25%20black%20or%20Latino%3A%20the%20California%20laws%20that%20keep%20minorities%20in%20prison&link-2-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2019%2Fnov%2F26%2Fcalifornia-gang-enhancements-laws-black-latinos&link-3-headline=Gun%20violence%20has%20sharply%20declined%20in%20California%E2%80%99s%20Bay%20Area.%20What%20happened%3F&link-3-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2Fng-interactive%2F2019%2Fjun%2F03%2Fgun-violence-bay-area-drop-30-percent-why-investigation\">Series linker</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cMost of our strategy is based on human interaction,\u201d said Sam Vaughn, program manager for ONS. \u201cWe need access and to be able to hug our youngsters and tell them that we\u2019re there, we need to be with them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne of our young people\u2019s friends was shot and to only be able to talk to him through FaceTime was difficult,\u201d said James Houston, lead neighborhood change agent for ONS. \u201cIt was good to be able to engage him, but for me, showing love is the most important part of our job,\u201d he continued.</p> <p>The staff said the stay-at-home orders have made it more difficult for some of the fellows in the program to avoid conflict. Before the stay-at-home orders went into effect, many of the young men who knew they were in danger of being targeted could keep themselves safe by staying with friends or family in different cities. Or they could blend into street and highway traffic to avoid being caught off guard by a rival. Now, that\u2019s not an option.</p> <p>\u201cAll of a sudden they\u2019re in the same place for a month, that news is gonna get out,\u201d said Vaughn. \u201cIt\u2019s not about getting lucky and seeing someone, it\u2019s just about waiting long enough.\u201d</p> <p>Now, instead of the usual hugs, handshakes and daps, Vaughn and Houston are waiting in line at Costco early in the morning to buy groceries that staff will drop off to ONS fellows. Neighborhood change agents do about 12 grocery deliveries a week and will continue to do so until supplies run out or Richmond\u2019s shelter-in-place order \u2013 which is set to <a href=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/27/bay-areas-shelter-in-place-to-last-through-may/\">expire on 31 May</a> \u2013 is lifted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"70d0c61a5853208c0d89c1e1f8d104461d0f692d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70d0c61a5853208c0d89c1e1f8d104461d0f692d/0_655_2448_1469/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Officer Sam Vaughn and staff members of Richmond\u2019s Office of Neighborhood Safety.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Officer Sam Vaughn and staff members of Richmond\u2019s Office of Neighborhood Safety.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richmond ONS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Houston and Vaughn say that some of the young men they interact with still believe they are too young and healthy to become severely ill if they contract Covid-19.</p> <p>\u201cSome of the young still feel like they\u2019re more susceptible to being shot and killed than catching the virus and dying,\u201d said Vaughn.</p> <p>But many people in their communities are at high risk of complications when contracting Covid-19. Black Californians account for just 6% of the state\u2019s population but make up almost 12% of its total Covid-19 related deaths, according to the most <a href=\"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Race-Ethnicity.aspx\">recent state data</a>, a discrepancy that stems from decades of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/its-a-racial-justice-issue-black-americans-are-dying-in-greater-numbers-from-covid-19\">systemic failings and medical discrimination</a>.</p> <p>So, in addition to their regular violence prevention work and delivering food and supplies, Houston and Vaughn are relaying the seriousness of Covid-19 to the people they interact with.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been great to deliver food to our young people and their families and tell them, \u2018Stay inside, you don\u2019t have to go out for anything\u2019,\u201d said Houston. \u201cWe\u2019re doing all we can so they can just ride this out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe number one focus is to make sure folks have the needs in their homes met so they don\u2019t feel desperate and do something drastic,\u201d echoed Vaughn.</p> <p>ONS staff and other violence interrupters in a handful of California cities are recognized as an <a href=\"https://www.thetrace.org/2020/04/the-very-essential-work-of-street-level-violence-prevention/\">essential part</a> of city operations. Even with this recognition Vaughn finds himself \u201chustling\u201d to get the necessary protective equipment \u2013 like masks and gloves \u2013 for himself and the rest of the staff. The supplies they do have are mostly donations from local residents and gun violence reduction groups such as Moms Demand Action.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re piecemealing it together and using all of our networks to make sure we have all the basics, cause it\u2019s a lot of exposure,\u201d said Vaughn.</p> <p>Vaughn adds that he sees the pandemic to be an \u201cequalizer\u201d of sorts. He argues that many Americans are now getting a glimpse into some of the hardships faced by many in underserved communities \u2013 especially the locales that have been stricken by gun violence for decades.</p> <p>He continued: \u201cAll the things people are feeling and dealing with now is what young people in urban America have been dealing with forever: questions of mortality, not having basic needs, feeling all alone.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",

  "<p><strong>\u201cWho is the shortest goalkeeper to play in either the old First Division or the Premier League? My guess it was Laurie Sivell who kept goal for Ipswich Town in the 70s,\u201d</strong> writes Mitch Mitchell.</p> <p>Peter Tomlin gets out the tape measure. \u201cLaurie Sivell is 5ft 8in tall (1.73m). There are three goalkeepers who have played in the top division in England that are officially recorded as being shorter than him. Ted Burgin was 5ft 7in (1.70m) and Burgin played three seasons in the top division for Sheffield United in the 1950s and won two caps for England B. He was also in the England squad for the 1954 World Cup although he didn\u2019t play. Steve Death was 5ft 7in (1.70m). He played one top-flight game for West Ham v Manchester City in 1969. He is more famous as a Reading player in the lower divisions where he had a very successful career. He also held the record for the most minutes without conceding a goal (1,074) until 2009.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/aug/23/the-knowledge-last-time-top-flight-goalkeeper-played-without-gloves\">When was the last time a top-flight goalkeeper played without gloves? | The Knowledge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cTeddy Davison, at 5ft 7in (1.70m), is the shortest goalkeeper to have played for England (one cap v Wales in 1922). He was first choice for Sheffield Wednesday for 12 seasons either side of the first world war and is recorded as saving 24 penalties of 77 in his career. He later managed Sheffield United.\u201d <br><br>Richard Worrall points out that Les Green, of Brian Clough\u2019s Derby County team from 1968 to 1971, was 5ft 8in, the same as Sivell.</p> <p>Fast forward to the Premier League era and Matthew Healey has a couple of contenders, having made the point that \u201cit\u2019s a matter of scientific record that <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6210375/\">(particularly) men lie about their height generally</a>. And the effect is likely to be magnified where there\u2019s a professional imperative to exaggerate, so there is dearth of accurate information.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m confident-ish that the shortest goalkeeper (at least by their declared height) to play during the Premier League era is Clive Baker, who stood at 5ft 9in and was Ipswich\u2019s first choice for a few seasons in the 90s. I vaguely remember him being a keen sweeper-up and a good reaction keeper \u2013 both useful attributes if you can\u2019t touch the crossbar.\u201d<br><br>Matthew starts flying without wings at this point. \u201cIf you\u2019re willing to count unused subs, however, there may be a better contender. A 16-year-old called Nicky Byrne sat on the bench for Leeds for a game at Southampton in around 1995 (I\u2019ve not been able to pin down the exact fixture, but you can read his <a href=\"https://www.balls.ie/football/turned-face-flag-cried-nicky-byrne-recalls-leeds-ireland-career-westlife-369824\">own comments on the experience</a>.) Some internet sources list him as being 5ft 8in or 5ft 8.5in though typically he himself claims to be a bit bigger. He was released by Leeds at the end of 1997 but popped back up again in Westlife a few years later.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"246e2618130567df156d1260cfb72ea43e9b9ddb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/246e2618130567df156d1260cfb72ea43e9b9ddb/0_0_2112_1266/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicky Byrne celebrates with the Leeds team after their FA Youth Cup final win over Crystal Palace in 1997.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicky Byrne celebrates with the Leeds team after their FA Youth Cup final win over Crystal Palace in 1997.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colorsport/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Shirts inspired by countries</h2> <p><strong>\u201cWolves\u2019 Europa League shirt is inspired by the traditional Mexican national team jersey, associated with record signing Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez,\u201d </strong>writes Miles Johnson.<strong> \u201cAre there any other instances where a club has released a kit to honour a national team or nation itself?\u201d</strong></p> <p>Robin Tucker suggests Barnsley channeling their inner samba spirit. \u201cI remember when Danny Wilson was manager of Barnsley, their fans would sing \u2018It\u2019s just like watching Brazil\u2019.\u201d The chant began <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW4wrqZypfA&amp;feature=emb_logo\">during the Tykes\u2019 promotion campaign</a> under Wilson in 1996-97, and still gets an airing every now and then.

But it was a wake-up call for Democrats: the fight for the White House and Senate in November will also be a fight for the rule of law.</p> <p>The Trump administration has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/30/donald-trump-judges-courts-justice-system\">brought a laser-like focus</a> to nominating and winning Senate confirmation for 193 judges \u2013 two supreme court justices, 51 circuit court judges (a quarter of the total), 138 district court judges and two US court of international trade judges \u2013 at a pace unmatched since the presidency of Ronald Reagan.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never in my lifetime seen an election whose stakes were higher,\u201d said <a href=\"https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/10899/Tribe\">Laurence Tribe, </a>who was born in 1941 and is a constitutional law professor at Harvard University. \u201cThe transformation of the federal judiciary into a series of puppets for a very rightwing ideology will have lasting impact for decades.\u201d</p> <p>Trump and Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader in the Senate, aim to guarantee a long-term conservative skew on decisions that affect millions of people, including abortion rights, environment regulations, gun control, immigration rules and access to healthcare (having failed to overturn Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act on Capitol Hill, the administration is now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/02/us-supreme-court-aca-affordable-care-act-challenge\">trying to do so in the courts).</a></p> <p>The new wave of judges is dominated by young white men often rushed through the Senate with little regard for standard procedure. Critics say the chief criterion for selection is no longer experience or qualifications but ideology.</p> <p>Tribe commented: \u201cHe\u2019s appointed one person after another, with the cooperation of of majority leader McConnell and a very supine Senate, who would never have been accepted in the past and are not comparable to those appointed by Republicans in the past.\u201d</p> <p>The professor added: \u201cMany of them will be there for 30 or 40 years. And so the entire landscape of the federal judiciary as a guard rail against various kinds of abuse and violations of the rule of law has been dramatically weakened for the foreseeable future.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018These judges are younger, more partisan, more political and really having a big impact on the lives of Americans\u2019</h2> <p>Progressives cite <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/us/trump-justin-walker-appeals-court.html\">Walker as a prime example.</a> He has only served as a federal district court judge in Kentucky since October. At the time of his appointment, the American Bar Association, which issues ratings on judicial nominees, said he was not qualified to serve because of his inexperience. ,He was eventually confirmed on a 50-41 vote.</p> <p>Walker is also a former clerk to Kavanaugh, who was narrowly confirmed to the supreme court after claims of sexual misconduct from decades earlier resurfaced. Walker did 162 media interviews, including 35 on Fox News (\u201cHe is a warrior with a backbone of iron\u201d), to defend his mentor, <a href=\"https://civilrights.org/blog/wilson-and-walker-are-conservative-extremists-and-thats-why-trump-chose-them/\">according to the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"84f766dcb7aae9b9bfdd5d052416e4bd8f5d0668\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84f766dcb7aae9b9bfdd5d052416e4bd8f5d0668/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh at the White House in Washington DC on 8 October 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh at the White House in Washington DC on 8 October 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Christopher Kang, chief counsel for Demand Justice, a progressive advocacy organisation, and who served in the Obama administration for nearly seven years, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen over the last three years the kinds of judges that President Trump has put in throughout the judiciary, from district courts all the way to the supreme court. They\u2019re younger, more partisan, more political and really having a big impact on the lives of Americans.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Overall, with his selection of judges, he\u2019s hit it out of the park\u2019</h2> <p>But conservatives disagree with this characterisation. <a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/staff/elizabeth-slattery\">Elizabeth Slattery,</a> a legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation thinktank in Washington, who went to school with Walker in Louisville, Kentucky, said: \u201cIt\u2019s true that he\u2019s young and new to the bench, but he had a background as an academic and his research was focused on administrative law and separation of powers. It just so happens the court he\u2019s been nominated to focuses very heavily on administrative law. So I think he\u2019s a great selection because he knows these issues very well.\u201d</p> <p>Slattery contends that Trump\u2019s selections haves been based on judicial philosophy rather than political ideology. \u201cMany of them are pretty young \u2013 a lot are in their 40s \u2013 so the expectation is that they will serve on these courts for decades to come,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s perhaps the longest-lasting legacy that any president can have but President Trump has really made this a high priority. Overall, with his selection of judges, he\u2019s hit it out of the park.\u201d</p> <p>Progressives, however, fear more Justin Walkers waiting in the wings. He is a member of <a href=\"https://fedsoc.org/\">the Federalist Society,</a> which favours an \u201coriginalist\u201d interpretation of the constitution and has created a pipeline of young conservative lawyers. Its alliance with Trump has helped him win over Christian evangelicals and other doubters on the right. Many pointed to Trump\u2019s release during the 2016 election of a shortlist of judges for the supreme court vacancy at the time as a political masterstroke that secured their vote.</p> <p>The courts barely featured in 10 Democratic primary debates. Even so, liberal supreme court justices <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/05/rbg-to-mp3-ruth-bader-ginsburg-inspires-classical-music-album\">Ruth Bader Ginsburg</a> and Stephen Breyer will be 87 and 82 respectively at the time of the elections in November.</p> <p>Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/16/politics/joe-biden-supreme-court-african-american-woman-nominee/index.html\">has already committed</a> to putting the first African American woman on the supreme court. But Kang said: \u201cHe needs to go a step further and explain literally who are some of the African American women that he\u2019s considering.</p> <p>\u201cThere are a lot of fantastic potential candidates out there who could really help excite progressives about how he would view the courts and how he would seek to restore balance and fairness.\u201d</p> <p>But the White House alone is not enough. If Biden wins the presidency and Republicans retain control of the Senate, a long war of attrition looms. McConnell refused to sanction a vote on dozens of Obama\u2019s judicial nominees, most infamously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/mar/16/obama-nominates-merrick-garland-supreme-court-dc-appeals-court-judge\">his supreme court pick Merrick Garland.</a></p> <p>Kang added: \u201cPeople may focus on McConnell blocking Merrick Garland\u2019s nomination to the supreme court, which was obviously a horrific display of anti-democracy, but what he did in the lower courts is no less appalling. On the circuit courts, over the last two years of President Obama\u2019s term, he only allowed two circuit court judges to be confirmed, which is the fewest since the 1800s.</p> <p>\u201cAnd judges overall, even if you include district court judges, was 22, which was the fewest since President Truman. That\u2019s very intentional and I think that\u2019s exactly what we could see if Republicans maintain the majority and there\u2019s a Democratic president.\u201d</p> <p>This year, 23 Republican Senate seats are up for grabs; Democrats only need to flip four to regain control. Such is the courts\u2019 power to block legislation that much of the Democratic agenda is on the line.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/importantmeagan?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Meagan Hatcher-Mays,</a> director of democracy policy for the Indivisible Project, a progressive grassroots movement, said: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be critically important not just to throw Trump out of office this year, but to also flip the Senate so that we can actually move forward with some of our progressive priorities and that includes judges, because pretty much every single piece of progressive legislation that passes through Congress under a Democratic president is going to be challenged in court by Republicans.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.pfaw.org/spokespeople/marge-baker/\">Marge Baker</a> is executive vice-president at People For the American Way, an activist group that has created a web page entitled <a href=\"https://www.pfaw.org/vote-the-courts-2020/\">Vote the Courts 2020</a> to \u201cidentify senators whose confirmation votes for unfit judges prove they don\u2019t deserve to keep their seats\u201d. Baker says: \u201cProgressives, independents, the public understands now in a way they haven\u2019t before the impact that these judges have on their daily lives.</p> <p>\u201cThey understand, frankly, because of the role that Mitch McConnell has played, how critical it is that you have not just a Democratic president, but also a Democratic Senate in order to process these nominations.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey see decision after decision, the court rolling back voting rights, putting healthcare at risk, putting reproductive freedom at risk, environmental regulations, workers\u2019 rights \u2013 everything that people have come to depend on is being overturned and upended by the courts.\u201d</p> <p>Such battles are not fought in the supreme court alone. Although Chief Justice John Roberts and colleagues steal the limelight, McConnell himself has noted the importance of the lower courts. Appearing on the <a href=\"https://www.tonyperkins.com/get.cfm?i=LR20D11\">Washington Watch podcast</a> with Tony Perkins in April, the majority leader said: \u201cIt\u2019s important for your listeners to know that most litigation never makes it to the supreme court.</p> <p>\u201cMost complex litigation stops at the circuit court level. The level below that is district courts. They\u2019re also important, but their decisions are, of course, appealable to the circuit courts.\u201d \u201d</p> <p>Democrats are hoping to convince their own voters on the same point. Should the party take both the White House and Senate, it would be no surprise if two dozen judges appointed by Bill Clinton in the 1990s seek retirement or senior status to make way for younger liberals with decades of service ahead of them. This would be a sign that, after four years of the Trump-McConnell onslaught, the pendulum had begun to swing the other way.</p> <p>In a news and political cycle usually dominated by instant gratification, victory belongs to whoever can play the long game. Hatcher-Mays of Indivisible said: \u201cI would like to see Democrats be just as aggressive in getting their judicial nominees confirmed as Republicans have been, even if that means not getting Republican support, because the point is these positions are for life.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>WhatsApp has alleged in new court filings that an Israeli spyware company used US-based servers and was \u201cdeeply involved\u201d in carrying out mobile phone hacks of 1,400 WhatsApp users, including senior government officials, journalists, and human rights activists.</p> <p>The new claims about NSO Group allege that the Israeli company bears responsibility in serious human rights violations, including the hacking of more than a dozen Indian journalists and Rwandan dissidents.</p> <p>For years, NSO Group has said that its spyware is purchased by government clients for the purpose of tracking down terrorists and other criminals and that it had no independent knowledge of how those clients \u2013 which in the past have reportedly included Saudi Arabia and Mexico \u2013 use its hacking software.</p> <p>But a lawsuit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/nso-group-points-finger-at-state-clients-in-whatsapp-spying-case\">filed by WhatsApp against NSO Group last year</a> \u2013 the first of its kind by a major technology company - is revealing more technical details about how the hacking software, Pegasus, is allegedly deployed against targets.</p> <p>In the court filings last week, WhatsApp said its own investigation into how Pegasus was used against 1,400 users last year showed that servers controlled by NSO Group \u2013 not its government clients \u2013 were an integral part of how the hacks were executed.</p> <p>WhatsApp has said victims of the hack received phone calls using its messaging app, and were infected with Pegasus. Then, it said: \u201cNSO used a network of computers to monitor and update Pegasus after it was implanted on users\u2019 devices. These NSO-controlled computers served as the nerve centre through which NSO controlled its customers\u2019 operation and use of Pegasus.\u201d</p> <p>According to WhatsApp\u2019s filing, NSO gained \u201cunauthorised access\u201d to its servers by reverse-engineering the messaging app and then evading the company\u2019s security features that prevent manipulation of the company\u2019s call features. One WhatsApp engineer who investigated the hacks said in a sworn statement submitted to the court that in 720 instances, the IP address of a remote server was included in the malicious code used in the attacks. The remote server, the engineer said, was based in Los Angeles and owned by a company whose data centre was used by NSO.</p> <p>NSO has said in legal filings that it has no insight into how government clients use its hacking tools, and therefore does not know who governments are targeting.</p> <p>But one expert, John Scott-Railton of Citizen Lab, who has worked with WhatsApp on the case, said NSO\u2019s control of the servers involved in the hack suggests the company would have had logs, including IP addresses, identifying the users who were being targeted.</p> <p>\u201cWhether or not NSO looks at those logs, who knows? But the fact that it could be done is contrary to what they say,\u201d Scott-Railton said.</p> <p>In a statement to the Guardian, NSO stood by its earlier remarks. \u201cOur products are used to stop terrorism, curb violent crime, and save lives. NSO Group does not operate the Pegasus software for its clients,\u201d the company said. \u201cOur past statements about our business, and the extent of our interaction with our government intelligence and law enforcement agency customers, are accurate.\u201d</p> <p>The company said it would file its response to the court in coming days.</p> <p>The new developments in the case come as NSO is facing separate questions about the accuracy of a tracking product it has launched following the outbreak of Covid-19. The new programme, called Fleming, uses mobile phone data and public health information to identify who individuals infected with coronavirus may have come into contact with. A report by NBC last weekend said NSO\u2019s new tool was being marketed in the US.</p> <p>But in a Twitter thread, Scott-Railton said his analysis showed it was relying on data that appeared very imprecise.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you are working with data with this much built-in inaccuracy, it would be pretty intense to issue alerts each time this happened. Or to require quarantines. Or testing. The rates of false positives here would be through the roof. But ... so would false negatives,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jsrailton/status/1254198212430368769\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Dang!
