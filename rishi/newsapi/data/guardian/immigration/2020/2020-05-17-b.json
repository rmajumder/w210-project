Talon, a former business magnate who came to power in 2016, has been accused of a crackdown that drove key rivals into exile.</p> <p>Parties allied to the president won all the seats at the polls last year after opposition groups were effectively banned from standing, but turnout was only 25%.

But Benin disregarded the ruling and severed some ties with the court in protest at the decision.</p> <p>Opponents called on voters to boycott the poll over the political situation and the risks from coronavirus. Many among the electorate appeared set to heed the call to stay home given the result looks certain to go in favour of those backing Talon.

and faces, <strong>Quebec</strong> is now debating whether to force everybody to put masks on.</p> <p>As the province <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/coronavirus-montreal-canada-hit-hard\">at the centre of Canada\u2019s coronavirus outbreak</a>, Quebec is currently \u201cstrongly recommending\u201d that citizens wear masks \u2013 but the measure will not be mandatory.</p> <p>Asked why not, <strong>Horacio Arruda</strong>, the province\u2019s public health director, told reporters: \u201cYou need to have a good argument for infringing on individual rights for the sake of a collective right.\u201d</p> <p>But such arguments ring hollow to <strong>Nour Farhat</strong>, a Montreal lawyer whose dreams of being a Crown prosecutor were dashed after the Quebec government passed legislation last year barring certain public sector workers from wearing religious symbols at work.</p> <p>The law \u2013 known as <strong>Bill 21</strong> \u2013 mainly affects Muslim women working in education, law and other public sectors. Farhat said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Bill 21 violates the rights of religious minorities without a real or urgent situation. And now that we\u2019re in a real and urgent situation, the premier cares about violating people\u2019s rights.</p> <p>For them, it was always OK to violate the rights of religious minorities.</p> </blockquote> <p>Bill 21 has always permitted masks for medical reasons, and government media representatives say their hesitancy on masks is not related to that law.</p> <p>But head and face coverings carry a certain political weight in Quebec. Recent years have seen multiple instances of people trying to snatch hijabs from women\u2019s heads in the province. </p> <p>And only last year did Montreal <a href=\"https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montrealers-will-be-allowed-to-protest-wearing-masks-as-bylaw-to-be-scrapped/\">reverse a seven-year ban on people wearing masks at protests</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/17/quebec-masks-mandatory-veil-ban-coronavirus\">Quebec ponders making masks mandatory after banning the veil</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ec12b5f8f0864e579f12827\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-17T12:22:35.029Z\">1.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Russia\u2019s virus spread stabilising, health official says</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The growth of new coronavirus cases in <strong>Russia</strong> is stabilising, a top health official has said, as the daily tally fell under 10,000 for the third time this week.<br></p> <p>The country has the world\u2019s second highest number of infections at 281,752, topped only by the <strong>United States</strong>. </p> <p>On Sunday, it announced new cases had dropped below 10,000 for the third day this week at 9,709. </p> <p>The head of Russia\u2019s public health watchdog, <strong>Anna Popova</strong>, said in an interview on Rossiya-1 television: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u2019ve moved towards the level of stability that we\u2019ve all been waiting for.</p> <p>I would say that of today, we have halted the growth [in the number of cases].</p> <p>For the last 10 or 11 days now, we haven\u2019t seen additional growth or it\u2019s been very small.</p> <p>Stabilisation can be seen over the whole country.

The leaders of <strong>Italy</strong>, <strong>France</strong>, <strong>Germany</strong> and <strong>Norway</strong>, together with the European commission and council, called earlier this month for any innovative tools, therapeutics or vaccines to be shared equally and fairly.</p> <p>\u201cIf we can develop a vaccine that is produced by the world, for the whole world, this will be a unique global public good of the 21st century,\u201d they said in a statement.</p> <p>The sole resolution before the assembly this year is an EU proposal for a <strong>voluntary patent pool</strong>. Drug and vaccine companies would then be under pressure to give up the monopoly that patents allow them on their inventions, which means they can charge high prices, so that all countries can make or buy affordable versions.</p> <p>In the weeks of negotiations leading up to the meeting, which is scheduled to last for less than a day, there has been a dispute over the language of the resolution. </p> <p>Countries with major pharmaceutical companies argue they need patents to guarantee sufficiently high prices in wealthy nations to recoup their research and development costs.</p> <p>Even more fraught have been attempts to reinforce countries\u2019 existing rights to break drug and vaccine company patent monopolies if they need to for the sake of public health. </p> <p>A hard-fought battle over Aids drugs 20 years ago led to the <strong>World Trade Organization\u2019s Doha declaration</strong> on trade-related intellectual property (Trips) in favour of access to medicines for all, but the US, which has some of the world\u2019s biggest drug companies, has strongly opposed wording that would encourage the use of Trips.</p> <p>Campaigners say the resolution expected to be passed by the world health assembly\u2019s 198 member states is along the right lines, but too weakly worded. </p> <p><strong>Jamie Love</strong> of Knowledge Ecology International said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In a global crisis like this, that has such a massive impact on everyone, you would expect the WHO governing body to have the backbone to say no monopolies in this pandemic. </p> <p>It\u2019s one thing for a country to use its economic clout to buy preferential access to drugs or vaccines.

Some research indicates that children are far less likely to become infected compared with adults but other studies suggest that when they do become infected, they carry as much viral load as an adult, and therefore pose a real risk of passing the virus on to others.</p> <p>The situation was summed up by a senior Labour frontbencher last week: \u201cEither you put the education of children at risk by keeping schools closed, or you take a risk with their safety.

  "<p>The impartiality of the criminal justice system is being undermined by the requirement that defendants declare their nationality at the start of proceedings, a report into the legislation has said.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.commons.legal/the-state-of-innocence\">critical study</a> of the Policing and Crime Act 2017 found 96% of surveyed lawyers did not support the regulations and 90% felt it had a negative impact on perceptions of fairness in the justice system.</p> <p>Introduced by Theresa May as part of her \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/27/hostile-environment-anatomy-of-a-policy-disaster\">hostile environment</a>\u201d policy to deport more foreign criminals, section 162 of the act makes it a criminal offence, punishable by up to 51 weeks in prison, not to provide the court with details of nationality or give inaccurate information on first appearance.</p> <p>The study compiled by <a href=\"https://www.commons.legal/\">Commons</a>, a not-for-profit London law firm specialising in defence work, was funded by charitable trusts through the <a href=\"http://www.strategiclegalfund.org.uk/\">Strategic Legal Fund</a>. It examined more than 500 cases across England and suggested the law was creating \u201cracialised courtrooms\u201d.</p> <p>David Lammy, the shadow justice secrerary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/sep/08/racial-bias-uk-criminal-justice-david-lammy\">whose own report three years ago</a> highlighted racial bias in the criminal justice system, said the latest study exposed the regressive nature of the legislation.</p> <p>\u201cThe policy is undermining criminal justice and the rule of law,\u201d the report states. \u201cThe question is sometimes not asked when it is mandatory to do so and asked when it is non-mandatory \u2026 [It] is often not understood by defendants \u2026 A significant proportion believe they are being asked for their race or ethnicity \u2013 some have even been known to give their religion.</p> <p>\u201cThe policy is having an impact on the perception of fairness in the justice system. Some defendants, particularly non-British nationals or those from ethnic minority backgrounds, feel they may not receive a fair trial or may be discriminated against. Justice must not only be done but be seen to be done.\u201d</p> <p>The report calls for an urgent review of the law. Stating nationality only on conviction would be less discriminatory, it suggests. The study found:</p> <p>\u2022 96% of legal practitioners surveyed did not believe in the policy.</p> <p>\u2022 79% of lawyers surveyed had a client state their ethnicity or race instead of or in addition to their nationality.</p> <p>\u2022 Two-thirds of defendants not asked for their nationality were white.</p> <p>\u2022 90% of practitioners felt the nationality requirement had a negative impact on perceptions of fairness in the justice system.</p> <p>\u2022 Some felt the question created a sense of otherness and alienation among defendants.</p> <p>Despite the criminal sanction, there were no prosecutions in 2018 for failure to provide nationality.</p> <p>Sashy Nathan, the Commons solicitor who oversaw the project, said: \u201cOur research shows the nationality requirement is being implemented in a way that is undermining fair trial rights and the perception of fairness in criminal courts. We should all want a justice system that we can be proud of and revising the rules on this issue would be a simple but meaningful step in that direction.\u201d</p> <p>Commenting on the survey, Lammy said: \u201cEquality before the law is a fundamental principle of UK democracy that is admired across the world. It is unsurprising that 96% of legal practitioners do not agree with this regressive policy.</p> <p>\u201cIf the purpose is to find out which offenders are foreign nationals, only those who receive a guilty verdict should be asked about their nationality at the end of the trial. It is wrong to ask this question to all defendants when they are legally innocent.\u201d</p> <p>A government spokesman said: \u201cWe are absolutely committed to removing foreign national offenders from the UK and continue to work closely with international governments to increase the number of prisoners deported.</p> <p>\u201cThese changes help identify foreign national offenders earlier, meaning the Home Office can begin deportation action sooner \u2013 saving the taxpayer money as a result.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The coronavirus pandemic is exacerbating the existing vulnerabilities of the world\u2019s refugees and internally displaced people, according to a report.</p> <p>Research from the University of Birmingham has revealed that many undocumented migrants were anxious about seeking medical help \u2013 fearful of being reported to immigration authorities and being deported \u2013 and were therefore suffering in silence.</p> <p>The report, Understanding the Impact of Covid-19 on Forced Migrant Survivors of Sexual and Gender-based Violence, due to be published on Monday, took witness testimonies from more than 90 survivors and organisations in five countries, including the UK.</p> <p>It found that victims were finding themselves locked in with perpetrators, with no access to shelters or advice organisations, and as a result were having to suffer abuse.</p> <p>Jenny Phillimore, the lead author of the research, said: \u201cSome women and their children are going hungry and without medical care \u2013 they are entirely destitute and reliant on the generosity of neighbours, themselves struggling.</p> <p>\u201cSocial isolation is exacerbating multilayered traumas \u2013 no distractions mean women are reliving abuse episodes, increasing anxiety levels, sleep problems and leading to suicide ideation.\u201d</p> <p>Tracy, 26, a Nigerian survivor of trafficking who lives in an International Organization for Migration shelter in Tunisia with her husband, Endurance, described life as becoming \u201cunbearably difficult\u201d since the beginning of the pandemic.</p> <p>The couple, who have irregular immigration status, are struggling to feed themselves, saying they are on the verge of starvation.</p> <p>\u201cThe life here in this pandemic is so hard, especially for us, the migrants. They gave us just 30 dinar [\u00a38] to eat for seven days but that can\u2019t even feed us for two days, so now we only eat once a day. It is very difficult and we have no one,\u201d said Tracy.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/superdiversity-institute/covid19-forced-migration-sexual-gender-violence/index.aspx\">report</a> found that in some countries there had been increased targeting by traffickers as well as pressure put on children to enter into marriages.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>There had also been a knock-on effect due to the cancellation of therapeutic services and self-help groups. Digital poverty confounded this issue, excluding many from participating in online meetings, resulting in many migrants spending long days alone.</p> <p>\u201cWith many women having lack of digital resources to access online/via phone \u2013 women who were moving forward with their lives now feel themselves slipping backwards and are losing hope,\u201d said Phillimore.</p> <p>She added: \u201cIndividuals feared going hungry and struggled to receive support due to pandemic restrictions, which included suspension of some projects. Work previously available in the informal economy disappeared and losing income opportunities increased economic hardship.</p> <p>\u201cForced migrants living in shelters, shared accommodation and overcrowded housing with shared kitchens and toilets were unable to self-isolate \u2013 creating health risks and anxiety about contracting the virus.

It brings to fruition the promise of an \u201cAustralian-style points-based system\u201d first outlined by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove when they were fronting the Vote Leave campaign during the 2016 referendum.</p> \n<p>With a Tory majority of 80, the bill should pass easily. \u201cThis historic piece of legislation gives the UK full control of our immigration system for the first time in decades and the power to determine who comes to this country,\u201d Patel said.</p> \n<p>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uks-points-based-immigration-system-policy-statement?utm_source=adda7e36-20e4-4894-ac9d-dc892abcae49&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=govuk-notifications&amp;utm_content=immediate\">Our new points-based system</a> is firmer, fairer, and simpler. It will attract the people we need to drive our economy forward and lay the foundation for a high wage, high skill, high productivity economy.\u201d</p> \n<p>And she highlighted the promise of a fast-track NHS visa, saying it would make it easier and quicker for medical professionals to work in the health service.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"110877d1-38f3-41d7-b7d4-a5a1646c140b\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Aside from temporary work visas, such as the one-year version used by many young Britons and others to work in lower-skilled jobs such as agriculture and hospitality, Australia has a strictly capped limit for permanent migration of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/mar/20/morrison-says-capping-migration-at-160000-is-to-save-budget-bottom-line\">160,000</a>. Of these spaces, about a third are intended for those moving for family or humanitarian reasons, with the rest based on skilled migration.</p>\n    <p>There are two types of permanent visa \u2013 people who are sponsored by a specific employer, and those who apply independently. Both routes require the applicant to accrue 65 points to move.</p>\n    <p>Points comes from a range of factors, among them:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li><b>Age: </b>These range from 25 points for those aged 18-24, to zero if you are over 50.&nbsp;</li>\n     <li><b>English language skills: </b>People receive 20 points for 'superior' skills, ten for proficient, and none for 'competent'.</li>\n     <li><b>Work experience: </b>More time in a particular occupation brings more points, with experience in Australia counting more than that from overseas.</li>\n     <li><b>Qualifications: </b>Again, higher qualifications bring more points, up to 20 for a doctorate.</li>\n     <li><b>Relevant skills: </b>Gaining entry requires your jobs to be on the so-called skilled occupation list, a lengthy collection of jobs with shortages, and various classes of visa for which such a job allows people to apply.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Some critics of the Australian system argue it is a blunt tool, and that the strict points-based criteria can mask other skills and qualities. The cap can also cover a significant backlog in processing people. However the idea of introducing a similar system in the UK post-Brexit has been repeatedly floated by prominent Leave supporters like Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage.</p>\n    <p><b>Peter Walker</b>, <i>political correspondent</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Touted by Johnson during last December\u2019s general election campaign, the NHS visa promises lower fees and rapid processing for qualified applicants such as overseas doctors who have secured an NHS job offer.</p> \n<p>However, Thomas-Symonds echoed the charge of his predecessor, Diane Abbott, that the government is continuing to write off lower-paid workers. \u201cThe government is labelling workers \u2013 from carers to retail staff, local government workers to refuse collectors \u2013 as \u2018low-skilled\u2019 when they have been on the front line keeping this country running throughout the crisis,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Full details of the new immigration rules, which will see EU and non-EU migrants treated equally, will not be published until later this year, but are expected to include minimum salary thresholds. The new system will come into force in January, when the status quo transition period is due to come to an end.</p>",

  "<p>In the midst of their first heatwave of the year, thousands of Greeks were released on to the Athenian Riviera this weekend to do what beachgoers love to do: swim, lounge and soak up the rays.

  "<p>Atlanta\u2019s mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms, comes on the line, introduced by one of her communications team, with a non-committal, \u201cHi there.

She\u2019s having a hard time keeping her kids off YouTube and TikTok, she says. \u201cThankfully, there\u2019s one week left of school. So I think I\u2019m more excited than they are.\u201d</p> <p>Like millions of other Americans, Bottoms has juggled working from home while keeping her children educated and entertained. Unlike most other Americans, Bottoms is running one of America\u2019s largest cities, Atlanta, in the middle of a pandemic \u2013 one that has disproportionately affected African Americans nationwide and in her majority-black city.</p> <p>On top of those worries, she\u2019s been involved a public disagreement with Georgia\u2019s Republican governor, Brian Kemp, after he embarked on a controversial plan to reopen the state \u2013 despite its infection rate still rising. The plan was seen as so risky even Donald Trump urged him not to do it. It also pitted a white governor against a black mayor.</p> <p>Now Atlanta\u2019s plight under Bottoms has been in the national headlines for weeks as millions of Americans monitor its trajectory of coronavirus cases and deaths. Bottoms has made the rounds on TV expressing her opposition to Kemp\u2019s proposals.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it was appropriate to begin with<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/23/georgia-businesses-wary-governor-brian-kemp-reopen\"> tattoo parlours, massage parlours, bowling alleys and barber shops</a>, and so on. I think a more thoughtful approach would have been in cases where people could socially distance,\u201d she says.</p> <p>In response to her criticism of Kemp\u2019s partial reopening, Bottoms received <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KeishaBottoms/status/1253143548809170944?s=20\">a racist text</a> calling her the N-word, which, she says, her daughter saw over her shoulder.</p> <p>She has tried bringing up concerns with Kemp, she says, requesting he require people to wear masks in places it might be impossible to socially distance, or where there might be crowds of 10 or more people in Atlanta, Georgia\u2019s capital and largest city. But he refused, she says.</p> <p>Bottoms in 2017 became the mayor of Atlanta \u2013 a city that has only had exclusively black mayors since the mid-1970s. Her victory came from predominantly black neighborhoods in the city\u2019s southern half. In the celebrated cultural capital for African Americans, she spoke about an <a href=\"https://www.atlantamagazine.com/news-culture-articles/atlanta-mayor-keisha-lance-bottoms-enormous-amount-racial-distrust/\">\u201cenormous amount of racial distrust\u201d</a>. Now, as she gains national attention for denouncing Kemp\u2019s leadership, her name has come up as a potential running mate for the presumptive Democratic nominee, Joe Biden.</p> <p>Bottoms is the daughter of the famous R&amp;B singer Major Lance, and was born and raised in Atlanta. In her YouTube video biography, she tells the story of how her grandparents came to Atlanta on a horse and buggy. Her childhood was far from idyllic, and something she has not shied away from speaking about on the campaign trail in 2017: she came home from school aged eight to her father being led away in handcuffs, later <a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/how-atlantas-mayor-turned-her-famous-fathers-arrest-into-a-passion-for-criminal-justice-reform-190018987.html\">jailed</a> for drug dealing.</p> <p>She graduated from high school and went to university in Florida before returning home to study law. She became a prosecutor and then a judge before entering city politics representing her south-western, predominantly black corner of the city for eight years. Then she won the race to be mayor three years ago.</p> <p>Racial disharmony seems to come with the job. This weekend, after a 36-second video showed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/06/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-georgia\">a black man shot by two white men</a> as he jogged through a coastal Georgia neighbourhood, Bottoms called Ahmaud Arbery\u2019s death a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/10/ahmaud-arbery-keisha-lance-bottoms-atlanta-mayor\"> \u201clynching\u201d</a>, catching the nation\u2019s attention as she accused Trump of inciting acts of racism.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s so fascinating to me that it reverberates in that way, because from my lens it is the assumption that everybody recognizes that it is a lynching,\u201d Bottoms says. \u201cThere\u2019s more interest in what I have to say as an African American mayor of a southern city.

Kemp beat Abrams by just under 55,000 votes amid allegations he purged tens of thousands of eligible voters from the rolls.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to give people an opportunity to govern.

The sunny Easter weekend would have normally jump-started the tourist season, which runs until September, but this year\u2019s shutdown left many of the sector\u2019s small- and medium-sized businesses counting their losses over Easter and the two May bank-holiday weekends.</p> <p>Nick and Aileen Mobbs were on track for their best-ever year after three decades at the Imperial Hotel at the northern end of the Great Yarmouth town beach, until lockdown hit and they had to cancel \u00a3200,000 worth of bookings between April and June.</p> <p>Nick, the third generation of his family to run the Victorian hotel, isn\u2019t sure whether they will able to reopen in time to catch the key July and August trade, or even whether visitors will want to return. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get a decent bite at the summer cherry, we won\u2019t have a comfort blanket for winter,\u201d adds Aileen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a2be0f40cf089900d4b1e66345279027572c72b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2be0f40cf089900d4b1e66345279027572c72b0/0_0_1024_682/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Great Yarmouth Hippodrome\u2019s Summer Spectacular last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Great Yarmouth Hippodrome\u2019s Summer Spectacular last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Jay family are hoping to salvage part of the summer season at the Hippodrome Circus, the town\u2019s distinctive turreted brick building which 1960s rock\u2019n\u2019roll drummer and band leader Peter Jay bought in 1979.</p> <p>\u201cWe know we will be the last piece in the jigsaw,\u201d says Peter\u2019s son Ben, the circus\u2019s general manager. \u201cPubs, clubs, restaurants and leisure will be last.\u201d They are working out how to redesign their circus spectaculars for a third of the usual audience, with groups sitting far apart in the auditorium.</p> <p>The business enjoyed its most successful year in 2019, giving 76-year-old Peter hope that foreign travel restrictions may spark a revival for traditional UK resorts. \u201cIn the last two or three years people got fed up with all the airport hassle and the staycations had come back, people were rediscovering the British seaside,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Twenty miles inland from Great Yarmouth, next to the Broads, Ian Russell, the owner of Wroxham Barns visitor attraction, is more circumspect. \u201cThe current situation is hellish.

  "<p>If Boris Johnson is mishandling the pandemic, he is not alone. Falsely claiming everything is under control, dodging responsibility, hiding from public view, exploiting the crisis for political gain, mounting artificial distractions and blaming the media: these are common behaviour patterns exhibited by some of the world\u2019s most powerful \u2013 and shifty \u2013 leaders.</p> <p>Will they pay a price for their lethal incompetence and cynicism? It\u2019s possible some will, though it may take a while. The pandemic is changing political calculations around the globe. Leaders who looked invulnerable suddenly appear less so. That in turn could shift the strategic calculus and alter the balance of power between countries in ways both unexpected and permanent.</p> <p>Donald Trump\u2019s performance is a lesson in how not to handle an emergency. It may become a compulsory case study for future students of crisis management. Trump minimised the threat early on, offered phoney assurances, and failed to make a plan. He has since accused China of <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2020-05-13/coronavirus-donald-trump-accuses-china-of-unleashing-a-plague-upon-the-world/\">deliberately spreading \u201cplague\u201d</a> while weaponising the crisis to smear his Democratic rival, Joe Biden.</p> <p>The president\u2019s myriad character flaws need no rehearsal here. But it seems a desperate Trump will stop at nothing to re-boot his re-election prospects. If that means fomenting a cold war with China, or stoking racial divisions and anti-migrant, anti-Muslim bias, he\u2019s up for it. And if all that fails, he may try to delay November\u2019s election, a scenario <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/12/us/politics/kushner-election-november.html\">not ruled out</a> by his sycophantic son-in-law.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Putin\u2019s decision to shield himself from harm has badly dented his image as fearless tough-guy leader</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Coronavirus has made a sort of leper of Trump. A lack of federal leadership and his support for prematurely ending state lockdowns he never truly supported appears to be propelling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/new-us-coronavirus-hotspots-republican-heartland-areas\">a rise in Covid-19 cases</a> in small midwest towns and rural communities from Iowa to Texas. These are the heartlands of Trump\u2019s America, where his most loyal voters live.<br><br>As a result, Republicans running for Congress are running away from Trump, fearful of infection from the miasma of lies and distrust enveloping the White House. As jobs disappear by the tens of millions, Democrats\u2019 hopes of winning the Senate are rising. Biden\u2019s lead in key battleground states is widening, fuelled by economic meltdown and Trump\u2019s gaffes.</p> <p>Vladimir Putin is another leader in serious viral difficulty. Only months ago, he looked invincible. All the talk in Russia was of constitutional \u201creforms\u201d that would effectively make him president for life.

Anxious to avoid personal blame for twin health and economic disasters, Putin has shifted responsibility for managing the crisis to the regions, which have effectively been left to fend for themselves. Wealthy businessmen \u2013 the so-called oligarchs \u2013 have stepped into the breach. In such ways does a leader\u2019s power erode and slip away.</p> <p>Other politicians are showing a degree of reckless insouciance that makes Boris Johnson look positively switched on by comparison. Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro hit a new low for irresponsibility by ridiculing public protection measures. Brazil has the highest Covid death rate in Latin America.

A structurally fragile economy, a hollowed-out civil society and media, and a climate of fear created by Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan have not proved conducive to a unified national effort \u2013 leading analysts to suggest the sultan-president\u2019s reign may be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/coronavirus-leaves-turkeys-president-with-nobody-else-to-blame\">drawing to a close</a>.</p> <p>Majority Kurdish areas in eastern Turkey, for example, the scene of frequent conflict with the central government, have reportedly been hard hit. Diyarbakir-based activist and author Nurcan Baysal tells a familiar tale of health workers <a href=\"https://ahvalnews.com/turkey-kurds/no-tests-no-doctors-no-civil-society-no-precautions-kurdish-cities-0\">afraid to go to work</a> due to a lack of protective equipment.

Rather, an emboldened Xi risks over-playing his hand as he seeks to <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/how-not-to-win-friends-and-influence-people-in-europe\">transform a calamity</a> into a PR victory for Chinese soft power, strengthening Beijing\u2019s clout at the expense of weakened western countries.<br><br>American fumbling, plus Russian and European debility, offer Xi a macabre opportunity to advance his vision of China as dominant global power. But the aggressive, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/aug/05/china.johngittings\">Boxer Rebellion</a>-style provocations of his \u201cwolf warrior\u201d diplomats and party cadres are feeding an international backlash.</p> <p>Pressure is growing to retaliate by quarantining Beijing, politically <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/5/1/21244364/trump-china-coronavirus-debt-retaliate\">and economically</a>. And that, in turn, boosts Trump\u2019s confrontational, self-exculpatory campaign narrative.</p> <p>Trump claims China wants to deny him a second term. Yet the opposite may be true.

  "<p>Postpartum psychosis affects approximately one in 1,000 new mothers, but is still rarely discussed; perhaps, as Laura Dockrill suggests in her memoir, <em>What Have I Done?</em>, because of the guilt and shame that attach to women who feel they have failed their babies and themselves by ending up in a psychiatric hospital. So it\u2019s refreshing to see two authors laying bare the nightmare of their own experience, though both memoirs are frequently painful to read.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/07/my-baby-had-devils-eyes-the-reality-of-postpartum-psychosis\">Catherine Cho\u2019s</a> <em>Inferno</em> is a haunting, eloquent evocation of becoming a stranger to yourself. She writes in spare, allusive prose, weaving in stories from Korean folklore and family history. There is a theme of displacement that runs through the book, from her grandparents, separated permanently from friends and family by the Korean war, through to Cho and her husband, James, Americans living in London when their son is born.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to know where the story of my psychosis begins,\u201d she writes. \u201cWas it the moment I met my son? Or was it decided in the before, something rooted deeper in my fate, generations ago?\u201d</p> <p>These questions of fate recur throughout the book, as a specific cultural take on the paranoia and sense of responsibility that plague all women who suffer postpartum psychosis: <em>Did I cause this? Is it somehow my fault?</em> For Cho, there is the guilty knowledge that she deliberately flouted Korean traditions surrounding birth and motherhood, believing herself liberated from such obligations: \u201cI didn\u2019t see why we had to pay attention to Korean traditions \u2013 or superstitions, as I thought of them.\u201d</p> <p>But as her grip on reality loosens, and the illness has her believing she is trapped inside a circle of hell, she turns to family history \u2013 her own and her husband\u2019s \u2013 for alternative answers. Ghosts, fortune telling, reincarnation and mythology, so much a part of her cultural heritage, now bleed into everyday life, as the doctors and nurses of the psychiatric ward appear to her as demons and angels.</p> <p>Cho moves between her time in hospital, where she writes in a continuous present as she tries to piece together her memories of who she is, and an account of the events that led her there, from childhood through an early abusive relationship to her marriage and motherhood. Her description of the slide into psychosis is one of the most chilling evocations of madness I have read, all the more terrifying for the calm and measured prose in which she delivers it; it\u2019s hard to believe this is her first book.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38c2b18a1e7055ee6db5590a8c18935971888faf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38c2b18a1e7055ee6db5590a8c18935971888faf/0_177_5302_3181/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laura Dockrill: \u2018describes unflinchingly the sense of being reduced to your animal self\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laura Dockrill: \u2018describes unflinchingly the sense of being reduced to your animal self\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laura Dockrill</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Poet and children\u2019s author Dockrill also writes forcefully of the paranoia of psychosis, the conviction that she is the only one who can see \u201cclearly\u201d and the knowledge that no one will believe her (it\u2019s easy to see, in these experiences, the genesis of so many sci-fi and psychological thriller plots). Dockrill\u2019s writing tumbles on to the page in all the messy, raw, breathless chaos of new motherhood; she describes unflinchingly the sense of being reduced to your animal self, with all the stink and leakage and physical pain involved in getting another body out of your own and then sustaining it.</p> <p>There is no consensus on what causes postpartum psychosis, though a traumatic birth can be a factor. Dockrill\u2019s birth experience is horrific, and because her son is underweight he needs to feed constantly, and eventually her sleep deprivation becomes a persistent feeling of dread. Cultural expectations weigh heavy on her as they do on Cho, not from family tradition this time but from Instagram. \u201cThe expectation that I\u2019d fall head over heels in love with my baby was overwhelming. I\u2019d see those photos all over social media, the kind with the smiling-crying happy mum and the naked baby on their chest.\u201d Instead, she is racked by guilt at the lack of bonding. Her son, Jet, \u201cwas like the ultimate pet that I couldn\u2019t give back. When would I start to feel anything like love?\u201d</p> <p>It is the singer Adele \u2013 Dockrill\u2019s best friend from their Brit School days \u2013 who first suggests she might have postpartum psychosis, as she grows increasingly concerned by Dockrill\u2019s strange and paranoid calls, and Googles \u201cgoing mad after having a baby\u201d. Dockrill is eventually committed to a psychiatric ward, where she becomes convinced that her musician partner, Hugo, and the doctors are conspiring to steal her baby. <em>What Have I Done?</em> is heartbreaking and brutal in its honesty, and it is remarkable that Dockrill has managed to wring black comedy out of so much suffering.</p> <p>One of the cruellest aspects of post-partum psychosis is the belief that it is not an illness but a character flaw (\u201cYou\u2019re not unwell, you\u2019re just a bitch,\u201d the voice in Dockrill\u2019s head tells her).<strong> </strong>There is a terrible loneliness to it, and both these books, with their very different tones, offer a hand of solidarity to other women, as well as the assurance that there is a way through. As Dockrill says: \u201cYears ago, would a woman be able to write about this stuff without being called a witch or thrown into an asylum? Probably not, I\u2019m doing it for them too!\u201d</p> <p><br>\u2022 <em>Inferno</em> by Catherine Cho is published by Bloomsbury (\u00a316.99).

Brazil\u2019s health ministry registered 14,919 new confirmed cases in the prior 24 hours, taking the total to 233,142, behind the US, Russia and the UK. Brazil has done just a fraction of the testing seen in those three countries. The Johns Hopkin University coronavirus tracker showed there have been 4,634,132 confirmed cases worldwide, with 311,781 deaths.</p> <h2>Obama attacks Trump administration\u2019s response to pandemic</h2> <p>Barack Obama attacked the Trump administration\u2019s response to the Covid-19 pandemic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/16/barack-obama-coronavirus-donald-trump-criticism-speech-covid-19\">during a speech on Saturday</a>.

Victorian premier Daniel Andrews said venues would initially be limited to 20 patrons, rising to 100 by mid-July. New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian, meanwhile, called for all Australian states to lift border restrictions. Victoria and NSW are the only states not to have closed their borders during the lockdown.</p> <h2>US states continue to loosen lockdown</h2> <p>New Orleans took its first steps to loosen restrictions that have been in place for two months, one day after the rest of Louisiana did the same, Associated Press reports.<br>The city is restricting buildings to 25% of capacity, like the rest of the state, but also requires restaurants, nail salons and other businesses to take customers by reservation. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said horse racing tracks and the Watkins Glen International auto track can reopen with no crowds, no fans.</p> <h2><strong>Germans press for return to Mallorca holiday homes</strong></h2> <p>Germans with holiday homes in Mallorca are clamouring to return to the sun-soaked island as the coronavirus lockdowns ease, but Spanish authorities are pushing back, Agence France-Presse reports. Several hundred Germans have in recent weeks sent pleading, sometimes angry letters to the regional government of the Balearic Islands asking them to allow foreign property owners to return to their second homes.</p> <h2>UK to invest \u00a393m in vaccine manufacturing centre</h2> <p>The British government will invest up to \u00a393m to bring forward construction of a new vaccine manufacturing centre, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said on Saturday. The funding will ensure the new centre opens in summer 2021, a year ahead of schedule. The Vaccines Manufacturing and Innovation Centre (VMIC) is a key component of the government\u2019s programme to ensure that once a coronavirus vaccine is available, it can be rolled out quickly in mass quantities, the department said.</p>",

While I welcome any steps to reduce traffic on the school run, having successfully delivered one of the UK\u2019s first traffic-free schools I\u2019m afraid that closing roads alone will not have the desired impact.</p> <p>At Ysgol Hamadryad in Cardiff, we decided from the outset to build a sustainable travel school. We worked closely with parents on mapping suitable routes and identifying any barriers to such travel. These included dangerous road junctions, lack of access to cycles/scooters, lack of confidence among children and timing challenges.</p> <p>We delivered a range of measures, including: a walking bus that runs every day of the year; cycling and scooting lessons from year one; plenty of bike and scooter parking; driving and parking restrictions in the immediate vicinity; working out particularly challenging road junctions; support for parents to access low-cost bikes and scooters. In our first six months of operation, some 98% of children\u2019s journeys to the school were active.</p> <p>My plea to schools that will hopefully follow our example is to consider all aspects of travel to school, not just closing roads.

In 2005, he played a central role in <a href=\"https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB152/index.htm\">persuading the Pentagon</a>, under threat of legal action, to release photographs of US soldiers returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in flag-draped military caskets.</p> <p>\u201cI think those images did make a difference. Americans were not seeing them,\u201d he said.</p> <p>There have been a number of searing images that have emerged from the Covid-19 crisis, such as the haunting pictures of refrigerated trucks parked outside hospitals, waiting for body bags. Another <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/photos-police-block-drones-from-photographing-nyc-mass-grave-site-2020-4\">memorable shot</a> was of mass graves being dug on New York\u2019s Hart Island \u2013 the New York police department swiftly confiscated the drone used to snatch it.</p> <p>But Begleiter fears that most of these powerful photos have come from virus-stricken urban centers \u2013 New York, Washington, Chicago, Seattle \u2013 as opposed to the rural heartlands now feeling the brunt of the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cIf ordinary citizens don\u2019t see it in their everyday lives, then they start to think, \u2018This is not my problem, it\u2019s other people\u2019s problem\u2019 \u2013 and that\u2019s what\u2019s happening now in rural America\u201d, he said.</p> <p>The invisibility of the crisis in the US heartlands is aggravated by the concentration of deaths in locations far away from the lived experience of most Americans. Hospitals aside, the full hurricane blast of the pandemic is being felt in three places, all of which are largely or totally out of bounds to the public: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/11/nursing-homes-us-data-coronavirus\">nursing homes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/women-prisons-coronavirus-victims\">prisons</a> which have a high proportion of African American inmates, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/02/meat-plant-workers-us-coronavirus-war\">meatpacking plants</a> that employ largely migrant Latino workforces.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ddd9e93061eb782da030210f81f44e45397f4427\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ddd9e93061eb782da030210f81f44e45397f4427/0_0_4807_2912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An inmate in the maximum security unit of the Cook County Jail in Chicago presses his hands against the window, below a plea for help.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"606\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An inmate in the maximum security unit of the Cook county hail in Chicago presses his hands against the window, below a plea for help.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tannen Maury/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The segregation of Covid deaths out of town and behind locked doors, where most Americans cannot see them, has provided a political boon for Donald Trump.

His early findings suggest that the invisible nature of the harm inflicted by Covid-19 is provoking volatile behavior at opposite ends of the spectrum.</p> <p>At one extreme, about 15% of those surveyed were found to be suffering from what Taylor has dubbed \u201cCovid stress syndrome\u201d. These people are so hyper-aware about the contagion, even though they cannot see it, that they experience profound anxiety about coming into contact with it, to the extent of becoming virtually housebound.</p> <p>At the other extreme, a similar-sized subset have drunk Trump\u2019s Kool-Aid and are convinced that the scourge is a hoax or overblown.</p> <p>\u201cThey are coming out and saying, \u2018We can see the economic devastation of the lockdown all around us, but we can\u2019t see people who are sick and dying,\u2019\u201d Taylor said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9ac38ef1f1a21545e06828984ca45cdf44ed93c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ac38ef1f1a21545e06828984ca45cdf44ed93c9/0_0_6240_4160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man pauses in front of the New York Stock Exchange on Wall Street as the coronavirus keeps financial markets and businesses mostly closed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man pauses in front of the New York stock exchange on Wall Street, as the coronavirus keeps financial markets and businesses mostly closed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The wave of lockdown demonstrations outside state capitolsis the sharpest manifestation yet of this.

In a fresh sampling of his survey group which has yet to be published, he found that a startling 21% of Americans said they would refuse a coronavirus vaccine.</p> <p>Were that proportion to translate into actual vaccine rejection, it could jeopardize the herd immunity upon which the health and safety of all Americans will depend.</p>",

The number of people who have lost their lives is 307,001 according to official tolls, but the true number is likely to be much higher.</li> \n   <li><strong>The number of deaths in the US</strong><strong> is projected to exceed 100,000 by 1 June,</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CDCDirector/status/1261406011039993856\">according to the CDC director Robert Redfield</a>. The agency came to the conclusion after tracking 12 different forecasting models; all of which predicted at least that number of deaths. Trump has oscillated, but has previously said the toll would be lower.</li> \n   <li><strong>Record increase in cases in Brazil. </strong>Brazil has confirmed 15,305 new cases; a record for a 24-hour period, as well as 824 related deaths, according to data from the country\u2019s Health Ministry. Brazil has registered 218,223 confirmed cases since the start of the pandemic, as well as 14,817 deaths.</li> \n   <li><strong>Beijing increases pressure on European states to reject Taiwan\u2019s WHO inclusion. </strong>China has stepped up the pressure on European states to reject Taiwan\u2019s call to be represented at next week\u2019s assembly of the World Health Organization, arguing that its presence can only be justified if it accepts that it is part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a>.The <a href=\"https://www.who.int/about/governance/world-health-assembly\">World Health Assembly </a>is being held virtually on Monday, and Taiwan\u2019s attendance \u2013 as well as a possible international inquiry into the start of the pandemic \u2013 are likely to be the two big political flashpoints between China and the west.</li> \n   <li><strong>US president Donald Trump said on Friday the US government was working with other countries to develop a coronavirus vaccine at an accelerated pace</strong>. Trump expressed his hope that a vaccine would be in place before the end of the year at an event in the White House Rose Garden and said his administration would mobilise its forces to get a vaccine distributed once one was in place.</li> \n   <li><strong>UK\u2019s reproduction rate still close to 1, bringing lockdown-easing steps into question. </strong>The latest official estimate places the national R value - the rate at which people are passing on infections to others \u2013 at between 0.7 and 1. An R value above 1 means the epidemic will start to grow exponentially again, which would result in a new surge of cases.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Europe could face deadly second wave of winter infections, WHO warns. </strong>Dr Hans Kluge, director for the WHO European region, warned countries beginning to ease their lockdown restrictions that now is \u201ctime for preparation, not celebration\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>Second health minister resigns in Brazil after less than a month on the job. </strong>Brazil\u2019s health minister, Nelson Teich, handed in his resignation on Friday, his office said, after less than a month on the job as the country becomes a world hotspot for coronavirus. Teich is believed to have disagreed with the rightwing president, Jair Bolsonaro. Brazil has now surpassed Germany and France and had more than 200,000 confirmed cases of the virus as of Thursday.</li> \n   <li><strong>Spain hails large-scale antibody study as a key tool in the fight against the coronavirus. </strong>The Spanish government has hailed a large-scale antibody study as a key tool in the fight against the coronavirus, but warned that any premature or irresponsible relaxation of restrictions could have \u201cenormous consequences\u201d given that only 5% of Spaniards have had the disease.</li> \n   <li><strong>Denmark reports zero coronavirus-related deaths for the first time since March. </strong>The country reported zero coronavirus-related deaths in the last 24 hours for the first time since 13 March</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div>"
