My first priority is and will always be the student-athletes and doing what is best for the program and the university.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Gundy has come under criticism since a Tuesday conference call with reporters where he said he hoped to have the team return to the on-campus football facilities on 1 May, in defiance of federal social-distancing guidelines. He said the the media has been overly negative in its coverage of what he called the \u201cChinese virus and added that if one of his players or coaches were to test positive after then, they would be \u201cquarantined just like we do people that get the flu\u201d.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe get people that get the flu during the season, we quarantine them, we treat them, we make sure they\u2019re healthy, we bring \u2018em back,\u201d Gundy said. \u201cIt would be the same thing here, but at some point, we\u2019ve got to go back to work. We\u2019ve got to get these guys back in here. ... From what I read, the healthy people can fight this, the antibodies make it better. They\u2019re doing some blood transplants now with the people that have already gotten the disease, that have gotten over it that have the antibodies that can fight it. There\u2019s a lot of people who can figure this out. May 1\u2019s our goal. Don\u2019t know if it will happen. Players will come in after that.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The remarks prompted a swift statement from the university, which said: \u201cWe will adhere to the advice of public health experts who are making informed decisions in the best interest of the citizens of our nation and state based on sound scientific data.\u201d</p> \n  <p>It\u2019s not the first time Gundy, whose annual salary is $5.13m, has whipped up controversy over his right-wing views. But USA Today\u2019s Dan Wolken made a salient point <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/dan-wolken/2020/04/07/oklahoma-state-coach-mike-gundy-coronavirus-comments/2966225001/\">in a Wednesday op-ed</a> that Gundy\u2019s political ideology is immaterial:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Hey, according to \u201cDr. Gundy,\u201d what\u2019s the harm in 18-, 19-, 20-, 21-year-olds possibly getting exposed to coronavirus? If they\u2019re healthy, it\u2019s all good, right? At any rate, we\u2019ve got to get moving, Gundy suggested, because paying salaries and \u201ccontinuing the economy in this state\u201d relies on the bodies of unpaid amateurs and people will \u201cfeel better\u201d watching football on TV.</p> \n   <p>Herd immunity, right? That\u2019s actually what Dr. Gundy was getting at. In fact, he referred to players as \u201cthe herd of healthy people\u201d who can fight the virus, even though that is, uh, not exactly the way any of this works. </p> \n   <p>None of this should be a surprise. Gundy has been edging toward the cliff of absurdity for a while now. In November 2018, he blamed \u201cliberalism\u201d for players transferring, saying \u201cI\u2019m a firm believer in the snowflake.\u201d He acknowledged Tuesday he\u2019s getting a lot of his information these days from the ultra-conservative One America News Network, an outlet he described as objective and non-political despite its history of pushing debunked right-wing conspiracy theories related to the murder of Seth Rich, and Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting survivor David Hogg.</p> \n   <p>But this isn\u2019t really about Gundy\u2019s political ideology or his sources of information. It\u2019s about him saying the quiet part out loud regarding how many college coaches view their players.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-11T22:17:48.787Z\">at 11.17pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e92312a8f08db3109f20e00\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-11T21:10:54.485Z\">10.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Arkansas senator Tom Cotton, who <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/17/business/media/coronavirus-tom-cotton-china.html\">floated a conspiracy theory</a> which said the Chinese government created Covid-19 in a weapons lab <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/11/republican-tom-cotton-coronavirus-china\">claimed on Saturday</a> that \u201ccommon sense has been my guide\u201d since he first learned of the outbreak in mid-January.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>\u201cNot Chinese communist lies.

Friends and others who have known him for many years are well aware that he had always \u2013 and certainly in his younger days \u2013 been rather dismissive of the idea of getting ill.</p> <p>The former Tory MP and journalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/paul-goodman\">Paul Goodman</a>, who worked with him at the <em>Daily Telegraph,</em> recalls this tendency: \u201cI remember he always seemed to regard being ill as a form of moral weakness. It baffled him.\u201d</p> <p>So the early messages about Johnson\u2019s solitary confinement were typically defiant. The symptoms, we were told, were mild \u2013 something of an irritant but no more. And they certainly would not prevent the prime minister from continuing to run the country and lead it, Churchill style, out of our grave national crisis and well beyond.</p> <p>Even then, however, there was understandable concern for the PM\u2019s health. Despite all the bravado and Johnson\u2019s \u201ckeep buggering on\u201d spirit, the 55-year-old had been placed on a significantly reduced workload in an attempt to aid his recovery.</p> <p>Incoming phone calls were strictly limited and paperwork drastically reduced. The PM managed to record almost daily videos of himself on his phone \u2013 pale, hair even more ruffled than usual, urging his people on \u2013 but they betrayed a certain desperation. Only his principal private secretary Martin Reynolds and director of communications <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/30/boris-johnson-spin-doctors-life-as-mirror-chicken-revealed\">Lee Cain</a> were in contact with the PM, apart from the daily consultations he held with his doctor.</p> <p>After more than a week in which the mood in the rest of No 10 was quiet and sombre, with many other staff off sick, there had been no improvement in Johnson\u2019s condition. While the health secretary Matt Hancock, who at 41 is 14 years younger than Johnson, was recovering fast, having fallen ill <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/covid-19-coronavirus-westminster-uk-pm-health-secretary\">at around the same time</a>, his boss was still not on the mend.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bdfff9c58620ff88b1f12e9d33d6741f11822ea2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bdfff9c58620ff88b1f12e9d33d6741f11822ea2/0_141_5628_3378/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson chairing a coronavirus meeting by videolink on 28 March while he was in isolation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson chairing a coronavirus meeting by videolink on 28 March, while he was in isolation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Parsons/10 Downing Street/AFP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By 2 April it had been agreed that the PM\u2019s condition and workload would be reviewed that coming weekend. Johnson chaired last Saturday morning\u2019s coronavirus meetingwith senior ministers, medical advisers and officials and, as ever, the word afterwards was that he had been \u201cin good spirits\u201d. But clearly it was becoming more and more of a struggle.</p> <p>After the meeting the PM\u2019s diary was completely cleared and that evening his pregnant partner Carrie Symonds tweeted that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/04/carrie-symonds-recovering-from-coronavirus\">she too was suffering from symptoms</a> and was also going to self-isolate. </p> <p>The worrying news mounted day after day. At just before 8pm on Sunday, on the advice of his doctor, Johnson was driven in a government car a few hundred metres from Downing Street to be admitted to St Thomas\u2019 Hospital.</p> <p>Again, his team tried to play down the significance of the moment, saying his admission was \u201cprecautionary\u201d. But the PM could no longer pretend to be Winston Churchill. He called Dominic Raab, foreign secretary and first secretary of state, and asked him to chair the main government meeting on coronavirus the next morning and stand in for him on other duties.</p> <p>Then last Monday evening his condition worsened on the ward, and he was transferred to intensive care. The Queen was informed and the news was made public.</p> <p>Charles Walker, a Tory MP who knows Johnson well, said that when he received a text on his phone relaying the news, he and his wife \u2013 like much of the country \u2013 found it hard to take. \u201cWe had watched the Queen on Sunday night, one of the anchors in our lives. She took us back to the moment in her reign when she broadcast during the war with her sister. Then to suddenly hear that our prime minister had been taken into intensive care \u2026 in my 52 years I really have to say I think it was the darkest hour.

How could it be that Johnson of all people was suddenly in danger of losing his life?</p> <p>Goodman recalled absurd images of Johnson suspended over London <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/16/stuck-zip-wire-boris-johnson-london-2012-olympics\">on a zipwire</a> in 2012 and said that, however divisive he might be, he was \u201ca life force\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHe is literally larger than life so when you hear he is dangerously ill it feels like a blow to life itself.\u201d</p> <p>Baroness Morgan, a former member of Johnson\u2019s cabinet, said she was bombarded with messages and texts from people who were not necessarily supporters of Johnson or the Tories. \u201cPeople just seemed to need an outlet and, like all of us, were thinking \u2018my God I can\u2019t believe this has happened\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>She struggled to sleep that night, wondering where this would all end. \u201cWhen I woke up \u2013 and I think this was the case with lots of people \u2013 I just thought \u2018oh no, what am I going to read now?\u2019 Thankfully the news wasn\u2019t any worse, but after what had happened you just didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>Even Johnson\u2019s fiercest critics were swept up by the national mood of sympathy. A former colleague from Johnson\u2019s days as a Brussels journalist said: \u201cI regard Boris \u2013 who was a friend \u2013 as a liar and charlatan for the way he has behaved, including over Brexit. But when I heard he was in intensive care I just felt this extraordinary wave of sympathy for him.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3639f8f0c3f8d4523cb689f327fa5a0678f35db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3639f8f0c3f8d4523cb689f327fa5a0678f35db/0_405_1668_1668/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson posted this image on Twitter on 7 April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson posted this image on Twitter on 7 April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @BorisJohnson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By Thursday there were tentative signs of improvement. Johnson had not had to be put on a ventilator at any stage. He had been stable for two days and was now \u201cimproving\u201d. A member of the No 10 staff reported a change of mood. \u201cThere is this cautious sense that it may be OK now. And people are returning to work. Dominic Raab\u2019s people are around more. There is more activity about the place. Let\u2019s just hope.\u201d</p> <p>By the evening the news came that the prime minister had been moved out of intensive care and back on to the ward. There was relief in all quarters, but also warnings. His <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/oct/07/biography.boris\">biographer Andrew Gimson</a> said some, at least, of Johnson\u2019s views of himself and the vulnerability of others will have to change.</p> <p>\u201cBoris never used to believe in illness. He neither admitted to sickness himself, nor noticed it in others. He believed he was strong enough to keep going regardless of any symptoms from which he might be suffering. His strong inclination was to overwork, not to put his feet up. In the light of his experiences one hopes he will change his outlook.\u201d</p> <p>His father <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/06/pms-father-stanley-johnson-passed-on-chinese-message-to-minister\">Stanley Johnson</a> also said his son\u2019s cavalier attitude had almost done for him. \u201cTo use that American expression, he almost took one for the team. We have got to make sure we play the game properly now,\u201d he said.</p> <p>While insisting that his son was not \u201cout of the woods\u201d yet, he was adamant that he must not try to play the heroic figure again during recuperation. \u201cHe has to take time. I cannot believe you can walk away from this and get straight back to Downing Street and pick up the reins without a period of readjustment.\u201d Yesterday the PM was reported to be relaxing on the ward by watching the films <em>Withnail and I</em> and <em>Lord of the Rings</em>.<br></p> <p>The former Tory MP Anna Soubry said she too was delighted to hear Johnson was on the mend. But it was equally important, she said, that he learn from his experiences and become a better and more sensitive leader. \u201cI am so pleased he seems to be on the mend. But all this Churchillian stuff has to stop now. He has to show that he has been humbled by this and realises that this illness does not discriminate between princes and paupers.\u201d</p> <p>She hopes he will change in other ways too, renewing his enthusiasm for immigration, which he voiced often during his time as mayor of London. And although he had expressed his gratitude to the NHS staff who had treated him, she added, \u201cI hope he thinks about the fact that many of the faces of the people he will have seen treating him so brilliantly in intensive care and on the ward, and who helped nurse him, were immigrant and non-white faces \u2013 many. I hope he thinks about that.\u201d</p>",

And no doubt today\u2019s 67 will become another example of that trend, eclipsed by the Norman psychodrama. But what a final round! Six birdies today, and a serene swing around Amen Corner, not a single bat of the eyelid as he traversed the most notoriously mind-bending stretch in major-championship golf. What a golfer!

There\u2019s no option. It just has to be. This morning, it looked like his 15-year quest for that elusive green coat would end. The ghost of Larry Mize, in particular, would be banished forever. But once again, the Great White Shark came so close, yet remains so far, having found yet another spectacular way to come a cropper in a major. The yearning goes on. You\u2019d like to think he\u2019ll come back and win this Tournament another day, but at 41 years old, this may well have been his last chance. Heartbreaking.

Nick played a great round, he played very solid and steady, and it was all my mistakes.\u201d Back in the Butler Cabin, last year\u2019s champion Ben Crenshaw helps Faldo on with his third green jacket.

And then after that it was hitting clutch shots. I had the honour on 12, and that was key. The good old match-play strategy, get it on first, and I hit a very good shot there. And I hit a good 2-iron on 13, I was very pleased with that shot. Greg was still in it, and we both hit good chips on 15. And then the last three holes, we all know what happened, so there you go. I swallowed hard, breathed harder, that was the situation, now it was mine to lose. So I had to put my head down and grind. I\u2019m delighted the way I\u2019ve played the back nine today. I was able to enjoy it [walking up 18] but enjoy it in a strange way. I was trying to enjoy it, but I do feel sorry for Greg.\u201d That refrain again. Faldo often gets undue pelters for perceived coldness, but he\u2019s been magnanimous in victory today.

And it\u2019s a true embrace, bittersweet but warm, both men fully aware of the historic importance and emotional implications of this wild final round. Norman appears genuinely happy for Faldo, offering hearty congratulations and a kind smile; Faldo a strange mixture of ecstasy and wish-I-could-have-won-it-another-way concern for his opponent. The brotherhood of golfers right there. They walk off the green arm in arm, and Norman pats Faldo softly on the tummy, each friendly slap saying well done, old boy.

A birdie would take him to within four of the lead ... but with the sun glinting off his flat stick, he dribbles a miserable putt wide left. Like Norman up on 10, he only half-committed to the stroke, and paid the price for his timidity. That\u2019s one hell of a yip. I wonder whether he was put off by a roar of disbelief elsewhere, as news of Norman\u2019s latest bogey was posted on the leader boards?

Hey, when it\u2019s your day, it\u2019s your day, and you\u2019ve got to take your luck while the going\u2019s good. Back in blistering style, 30 strokes, for a course-record-equalling first round of 63.</p> <p><strong>Nick Price set that particular mark ten years ago. </strong>Ah, 1986, the year Norman got tight coming up the last, converting prime real estate in the centre of the fairway into an eminently avoidable bogey that cost him the chance of a play-off with Jack Nicklaus. He\u2019s come even closer since, denied a year later by Larry Mize\u2019s outrageous chip-in, then missing a 12-footer on 18 in 1989 for a play-off berth alongside unfortunate rhymer Scott Hoch and eventual winner Nick Faldo. But this year\u2019s opening-day 63 suggests that finally, this could be Greg\u2019s time.</p> <p><strong>Norman followed his scintillating 63 with a swell 69 and a solid 71, and goes into the final day with an almost insurmountable six-shot lead. </strong>Surely this is his day of destiny?! No player has ever shipped as big a 54-hole lead at any major, never mind here at Augusta National. In fact, it\u2019s only happened three times on Tour (Bobby Cruickshank in 1928, Gay Brewer in 1969 and Hal Sutton in 1983). It\u2019d take a meltdown of epic proportions for Norman to be denied this time. And even then, it\u2019d probably require something special from one of the chasing pack, too.</p> <p><strong>The only problem with that: Nick Faldo and Phil Mickelson are currently in second and third positions.</strong> The 25-year-old Mickelson hits it long and is fearless around the greens, with a riverboat approach to golf that Norman, pin-seeker to the marrow, will surely admire. Augusta will be Lefty\u2019s playground, maybe today, certainly sometime soon, it just <em>has</em> to be. Meanwhile the altogether more steady and sedate Faldo - twice a winner here already, in 1989 and 1990 - is probably the last player Norman would choose to go round with him in the final group this afternoon. Norman may have snatched the 1993 Open from under Faldo\u2019s nose with a final-day 64 at Sandwich, but when the two met in the last group on Open Saturday three years earlier at St Andrews, Faldo shot a sparkling 67 while Norman slumped to a three-putt-strewn 76, overheating under the intense spotlight of the high-profile head-to-head. He\u2019d do well to park that memory for the next few hours.</p> <p><strong>But look, a six-shot lead is a six-shot lead is a six-shot lead, and by rights this should be a procession. </strong>CBS will be going live soon. It\u2019s on! Before that, though, let\u2019s remind ourselves of the state of play after 54 holes...</p> <p><strong><em>-13: </em></strong><em>Greg Norman<br> <strong>-7:</strong> Nick Faldo<br> <strong>-6:</strong> Phil Mickelson<br> <strong>-4:</strong> David Frost, Scott McCarron, Duffy Waldorf<br> <strong>-3:</strong> Scott Hoch, John Huston<br> <strong>-2:</strong> David Duval, Ernie Els, Lee Janzen, Frank Nobilo, Corey Pavin, Vijay Singh, Ian Woosnam</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlpwHBn6ikg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BlpwHBn6ikg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Turn this up to 11, shut your eyes, and float away.</figcaption> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-11T16:30:32.477Z\">at 5.30pm BST</time></p>  </div>",
  "<p>Until a month ago, the word \u201cquarantine\u201d conjured up images of someone joking about their bout of the flu, of animals entering our country, or of Sydney\u2019s Q Station, where for 150 years until 1984, migrants suspected of carrying contagious diseases were put into isolation.</p> <p>Quarantine has typically meant isolating people from the wider community; it has rarely been applied to the community as a whole. And the prospect can be terrifying.</p> <p>There are communities in the world we could look to for guidance, communities that have been living in isolation and making it work \u2013 on a rotating basis \u2013 for decades. They exist in natural quarantine, surrounded by lots and lots of ice.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/08/cooped-up-is-coronavius-lockdown-a-good-time-to-start-keeping-chickens\">Cooped up: is coronavirus lockdown a good time to start keeping chickens?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are two scientific research bases in Antarctica that exist as civilian \u201ctowns\u201d. There are children, a school, a medical centre and a gym. People can congregate, but supplies are limited. And the rest of the world and loved ones feel far away.</p> <p>One such town is the Argentinian Esperanza Base, with around 60 residents and 10 families, which is sprinkled around Hope Bay, on the tip of the Antarctica peninsula.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97b0aa42091f420abf3110b738a9320159177374\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97b0aa42091f420abf3110b738a9320159177374/0_0_5627_3375/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A family community, Argentine Esperanza base, Antarctic Peninsula, Antarctica, Polar Regions\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Square little houses are painted bright red (so they can be seen in a blizzard).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Geoff Renner/Getty Images/Collection Mix: Subjects RF</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was lucky enough to spend some time at Esperanza in late 2016 as part of an Antarctic expedition with tour operator Chimu Adventures. Lately, I have been reflecting on this brush with isolation.</p> <p>After a 14-month stint, the station\u2019s residents were packing up to return to Argentina for Christmas. Sixty new residents were preparing to replace them.</p> <p>There was a pre-holiday buzz in the air, and a sense of pride that comes from having lived more than a year on a slab of rock and ice at the bottom of the world, and having made it work. It\u2019s a sense of achievement that we too will enjoy when we emerge from isolation a few months from now.</p> <p>But first we must endure it. Those who live at Esperanza admit it\u2019s not easy. The base\u2019s motto is \u201cPermanencia, un acto de sacrificio\u201d (\u201cPermanence, an act of sacrifice\u201d). It takes patience, work and planning to make quarantine and isolation a success. Although their circumstances are different \u2013 the small community are still able to gather, touch and socialise \u2013there\u2019s much we can take away from how they live. Beginning with one essential ingredient.</p> <p>Esperanza is Spanish for \u201chope\u201d. The base is named in honour of three Swedish explorers who were stranded here in the harsh southern winter of 1902 after their ship was crushed by ice. They built a shelter of rocks, and after almost a year, they were rescued. Without hope and determination they would have perished.</p> <p>Today\u2019s residents of Hope Bay live in relative comfort. Square little houses are painted bright red (so they can be seen in a blizzard), the school is colourful and creative, and the communal hall, the Casino, is decorated with pride \u2013 Argentinian maps and flags and patriotic posters. Creativity brings joy; pride offers purpose.</p> <p>There is gas oil for heating (the base uses 250,000 litres of it each year) and a reasonable satellite connection to speak to loved ones back home, or for the kids to play video games against old friends.</p> <p>The pantry is a warehouse of frozen and tinned fare. Esperanza\u2019s chef requires military standards of organisation and some creativity to cook up tasty meals, day after day \u2013 like the pizza the entire community shares at the Casino on Saturday nights.</p> <p>It made me realise how much we rely on supermarkets and the convenience of regular shopping. Without them, we use our imagination, we share ideas and we collaborate.</p> <p>Food and fuel from the real world make it possible to live in Antarctica. But, like anywhere, it\u2019s human connection that sustains life.</p> <p>The residents of Esperanza find it incredibly hard to miss big gatherings like birthdays, weddings and funerals; to connect regularly with loved ones and old friends. Social media and video-calling can help, but it\u2019s a different kind of connection: distant, remote. No touch.</p> <p>In the quiet of Antarctica, people learn to rejuvenate instead by developing more intimate relationships with their immediate clan \u2013 and through nature.</p> <p>Ana, who assisted her husband, Esperanza\u2019s chef, grew to love her new way of life. She told me, \u201cwhen I need time to myself, I\u2019m feeling sad or I\u2019m missing people back home, I take a walk in the snow and appreciate where I am. When I\u2019m still, I notice how the light on the ice changes every day and throughout the day.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"876a2f90d368c4a5c851abec2b5dbc1c14b95a79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/876a2f90d368c4a5c851abec2b5dbc1c14b95a79/0_346_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Esperanza base\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We cannot have problems on the base. We must be strong and determined and respectful.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Caroline Berdon/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI could stay another year. I love the landscape, the views, the people, the community.\u201d</p> <p>Which makes me wonder now, is a quieter, simple life, with more time with our close family, and more time appreciating the nature in our own backyard, something we could all get used to, and draw energy from?</p> <p>The base\u2019s deputy, Eric Dorado, had missed little about Argentina during his year on the ice\u2013 \u201cjust beaches and heat\u201d. An unexpected takeaway was a newfound depth of patience and empathy he\u2019d acquired from living in close quarters for so long.</p> <p>At Esperanza, social problems are solved without delay. \u201cWe get together, we talk, we solve them,\u201d he said.</p> <p>It is a lesson those isolating with flatmates or families can learn from. With fewer bodies, personalities seem bigger and emotions stronger. There are days when people want to disappear, be alone, see someone different, be somewhere different. \u201cWe cannot have problems on the base. We must be strong and determined and respectful.\u201d</p> <p>Esperanza is a place of harmony \u2013 and pride. Despite the isolation, there is unity. Down there on the ice, the residents of Esperanza see their time in quarantine as a rare human experiment: to live, breathe and support each other in an isolated corner of the earth.</p> <p>And that\u2019s an opportunity.</p>",

Other problems included seizures and conditions involving the supply of blood to the brain.</p> \n  <p>The team add that neurological problems were more common among those with more severe forms of Covid-19, while they note some patients who went on to be diagnosed with Covid-19 turned up at the hospital only with neurological problems and without typical symptoms such as a fever or cough.</p> \n  <p>The team also point to previous research which revealed that the coronavirus gets into human cells by interacting with an enzyme, called ACE2 that is present on the membranes of cells in the lungs as well as in the nervous system and skeletal muscle.</p> \n  <p>However, the study has limitations, including that it only involves a small group of patients, certain tests were not carried out due to infection concerns \u2013 meaning most problems were simply described by patients \u2013 and it is not clear to what extent the coronavirus is causing the neurological problems, or whether they were already present.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JAMANeuro/status/1248659372710006785\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p

Cambridge, said there were a number of initiatives looking into possible neurological problems linked to Covid-19.</p> \n  <p> But, she added, some of the symptoms outlined in the study may not be down to such disorders per se, noting symptoms such as dizziness and headaches are common when people are unwell, while symptoms such as loss of muscle mass can occur when people are bed-bound, and cognitive impairment can be a byproduct of being in intensive care.</p> \n  <p>But Newcombe noted that it was likely some patients were experiencing true neurological problems, noting reports of higher rates of stroke and blood clots, including in the lungs, chime with what she had seen.</p> \n  <p>Others said the results were not surprising.</p> \n  <p><strong>\u201c</strong>Many respiratory viruses appear to not only affect the respiratory system but can spread from the airways to the central nervous system,\u201d said Prof Julian Hiscox, chair in infection and global health at the

on the respiratory problems Covid-19 causes.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAt the moment neurological complications might best be considered a consequence of Covid-19 disease severity rather than a distinct new concern,\u201d he said.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-11T10:19:45.025Z\">at 11.19am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div

Church leaders from across the UK have used social media and streaming to keep their congregations, many of whom are in their 80s and 90s, connected to the church when many are in isolation.</p> \n  <p>Rev Peter Atkinson has recreated Worcester Cathedral in a spare bedroom in his house from where he broadcasts morning services for people to stream at home. He stressed: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s really important that we don\u2019t think of Holy Week and Easter as being \u2018cancelled\u2019 - we are celebrating in a different way.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The reverend described how the unorthodox services so far have seemingly encouraged more people to attend church virtually, and may even be considered more public than conventional worship. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>An early morning midweek service in the cathedral might have a congregation of three or four, now the same service has been viewed several thousand times by the end of the day.</p> \n   <p>The churches have been closed for \u2018public worship\u2019 and here I am live streaming the same service from my spare room, and I get a message from a complete stranger in Australia saying \u2018so good to join your service this morning\u2019. If that\u2019s not public, I don\u2019t know what is!</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>On Palm Sunday Rev Dean Aaron Roberts from BMMR parishes (Bedwas, Machen, Michaelston-y-Fedw and Rudry) just outside Cardiff, helped to set up a Google Meets online video Bible discussion group for Easter. Due to all of their Easter services going online, it \u201cprovides more opportunity to people to get involved and I don\u2019t think the church will ever be the same again!\u201d</p> \n  <p>There are members of the congregation who are in their 80s and 90s who are now using Google Meets and other social media to stay connected to the church whilst in isolation.

  "<p>A democratic socialist, Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign amplified and projected ideas that radical grassroots organizers have been demanding for centuries in this country. His surrogates gave fiery, mesmerizing speeches at rallies that featured crowds larger than 25,000. Now, he has suspended his presidential campaign. This was his second run for the Oval Office.</p> <p>Sanders\u2019 political outsider savviness was his strength and weakness. He was sometimes criticized for not having specific plans for black people. I agree with a more nuanced version of this claim: Sanders did not demonstrate how he would prevent racism from impeding the universal programs that would help black people. While disappointing and warranted, his shortcoming mostly provided an easy cover for liberals to undermine his political ascension. Former vice-president Joe Biden authored a devastating crime bill that increased policing and mass incarceration, but that was smoothed away with his \u201cWe Know Joe\u201d slogan aimed at black communities. The California senator Kamala Harris laughed about threatening to prosecute poor black mothers for school absenteeism, but also made punchy race soundbites during debates that went viral. Even the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s defense of capitalism and neoliberal ideas was obscured by her larger pronouncements to protect black women in hospitals and the workplace \u2013 bastions of capitalist exploitation. But Sanders\u2019 wise refusal to pander to black voters manifested in a perhaps unwise polar extreme: an unarticulated specific response to black plight.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/08/bernie-sanders-revolution-not-over\">Bernie Sanders\u2019 political revolution is not over | Bhaskar Sunkara</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When he flew to Michigan instead of where he was scheduled to speak in Jackson, Mississippi, headlines emerged that Sanders <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/us/politics/bernie-sanders-democratic-primary.html\">ceded the south </a>\u2013 meaning black voters \u2013 to Biden. He did not give a race speech in Detroit, but instead passed the microphone to black organizers to talk about their own issues. The day before his campaign suspension he talked about black voters, the coronavirus and the need for a targeted response in a virtual town hall.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Sanders had the most progressive presidential campaign in recent memory. By far, he had the enthusiasm and support of black people under 50, and was polling higher than Biden among black people as recently as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/opinion/bernie-sanders-black-voters.html\">late February</a>. Free college and complete student debt cancellation could have decreased the wealth gap for all people, but for black students in particular because they disproportionately carry high debt loads. Medicare for All could have decreased future generations\u2019 prospects of facing pre-existing conditions and increased their health outcomes. Ending wars would have reduced the United States\u2019 militarism and slowed down the armed services from recruiting this country\u2019s poorest people. Vulnerable, dispossessed and oppressed communities in the United States and abroad would have experienced a significant improvement in their quality of life. Unhoused people would have entered homes and billionaires entered political homelessness. And when Biden went <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2020/03/joe-biden-coronavirus-pandemic-presidential-campaign\">virtually absent</a> during the Covi-19 panic, Sanders shifted his campaign to a multimillion-dollar relief effort.</p> <p>Sanders\u2019 supporters now face a nearly impossible situation. For years, politicians and pundits asserted that Sanders is not a \u201creal Democrat\u201d. Those same critics now expect Sanders supporters to \u201cvote blue no matter who\u201d, regardless of being independent voters. If Biden loses to Donald Trump, then Sanders\u2019 supporters will be blamed for failing to fall in line. If Biden wins, the Democratic party will resist any transformational concessions to the party\u2019s left voters. We must not let them.</p> <p>If Sanders is right about losing the electability argument but winning the ideological one, then that\u2019s where his supporters must continue organizing if Biden wants their vote. Rather than \u201cvote blue no matter who\u201d, we must vote green for our planet, and brown and black for our people \u2013 and make demands on Biden that will fundamentally change this country. I do not expect Biden to become a socialist overnight, nor can he expect Sanders supporters to wake up neoliberal capitalists. Thus, Biden supporters should be putting pressure on <em>him</em> to change instead of threatening millions of other voters with a Trump card.</p> <p>As an alternative to using social media to express #NeverBiden, individual progressive voters might join or support coalitions that are using a collective and organized process to put pressure on the vice-president to agree to universal healthcare, a moratorium on deportations, and to overhaul his climate change plan. And instead of shaming protest voters who refuse to participate in this fragile election, Democrats should examine why their party fails to inspire millions of people they claim to represent.</p> <p>We must not vote like our lives depend on it. Biden must change because our planet depends on it.</p> <ul> <li><p>Derecka Purnell is a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul>",

Her performances caught the attention, new seats opened up and another season in the W Series beckoned. But the promise of 2020 lies in tatters and the outbreak may yet finish it off.</p> <p>It has clearly been a major disappointment and she admits to finding the situation depressing, but there is no pause as Powell immediately acknowledges the bigger picture. \u201cIf it means we can fight the virus, stop it from spreading, prevent illness and deaths then of course we should not go racing,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cPeople\u2019s health is much more important.

For Powell it worked handsomely: she became one of several competitors whose subsequent success comprehensively proved the series is making a difference.</p> <p>Before the end of the season Powell was offered a drive in the US in the IMSA sports car championship. That was followed by a contract for a full-time seat in the Jaguar I-pace eTrophy series that supports Formula E meetings. Before its calendar also came to halt Powell had made her mark, with two podium finishes helping her to third in the standings, while in February she was given a shot in the Formula E rookie test for Envision Virgin Racing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d4f5622f129208b81af4997a73f03856787a5500\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4f5622f129208b81af4997a73f03856787a5500/6_120_1844_2305/800.jpg\" alt=\"Alice Powell pictured at the age of eight during her first season of karting.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alice Powell pictured at the age of eight during her first season of karting.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stuart Clarke/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cMy name wasn\u2019t out there, when I wasn\u2019t racing,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople started to forget about me, I hadn\u2019t been around, then the W Series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/apr/27/alice-powell-w-series-opportunity-back-out-racing\" title=\"\">came along</a> and the attraction of interest from around the world was incredible. That surely had to help. Without the W Series I probably wouldn\u2019t have had the drives.\u201d</p> <p>Powell has been racing since she was eight. Her talent was recognised early yet despite success across a range of championships including GP3, she did not receive backing and as the money dried up so did the opportunities for her to compete.</p> <p>She continued as a racing coach but was working with her father in house renovations when the W Series offered her a second chance. It was a life-changing moment, brought home recently in a moment of quiet reflection during the lockdown. \u201cI was looking back through photos on my phone,\u201d she says. \u201cI have lots of photos of my dog and that kind of stuff and then it hit January last year and it\u2019s just all racing.\u201d</p> <p>Powell is as engaging and enthusiastic as she is sharp and competitive on the track. That racing is everything to her is unmistakable: it is a passion to which she is wholly committed. She feels its absence almost as a physical loss, yet accepts with an admirably calm stoicism that under the current circumstances even another year out would be a small price to pay.</p> <p>\u201cWe love our sport so much,\u201d she says. \u201cThat I don\u2019t know when I will next be in a car again brings me back to when I was not racing and that sinking feeling inside that I don\u2019t know when it is next going to be, its horrible.</p> <p>\u201cBut the health of everybody is far more important. More important than racing. More important than sport.\u201d</p>",

Tsai has spearheaded a swift and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/04/asia/taiwan-coronavirus-response-who-intl-hnk/index.html\">successful defence</a> to the pandemic; despite Taiwan\u2019s proximity to mainland China it has largely contained the virus and has just under 400 confirmed cases. It is so well prepared that it is <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/09/taiwan-is-exporting-its-coronavirus-successes-to-the-world/\">donating 10</a><a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/09/taiwan-is-exporting-its-coronavirus-successes-to-the-world/\">m masks</a> to the US and 11 European countries.</p> <p>New Zealand, led by Jacinda Ardern, is also a world leader in combating the virus. The country has had only one <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/09/asia/new-zealand-lessons-intl-hnk/index.html\">Covid-19 death so far</a>. That\u2019s partly due to geography and size: with under 5 million people, New Zealand\u2019s entire population is much smaller than New York\u2019s. Being an island state also gives it a distinct advantage. However, leadership is also a factor. New Zealand has implemented widespread testing and Ardern has responded to the crisis with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/clarity-and-compassion-what-australia-can-learn-from-new-zealands-coronavirus-response\">clarity and compassion</a>.</p> <p>Germany has been hit hard by coronavirus, but it has an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/world/europe/germany-coronavirus-death-rate.html\">exceptionally low mortality rate of around 1.6%</a>. (Italy\u2019s fatality rate is 12%; Spain, France and Britain\u2019s is 10%; China\u2019s is 4%; America\u2019s is 3%.) A number of factors feed into Germany\u2019s low death rates, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/germany-low-coronavirus-mortality-rate-puzzles-experts\">early and widespread testing</a> and a large number of intensive care beds. Again, however, the country\u2019s leadership plays a role. As one wag on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mhdksafa/status/1246822725886320640?s=20\">joked</a>: if you\u2019re asking why death rates are so low in Germany and so high in America, it\u2019s \u201cbecause their president used to be a quantum chemist and your president used to be a reality television host\u201d. Angela Merkel, who has a doctorate in quantum chemistry, is actually the chancellor not the president, but the sentiment still holds.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/03/30/823912064/the-danish-way-is-working-prime-minister-hints-at-a-gradual-reopening-for-april\">Denmark</a> (led by prime minister Mette Frederiksen) and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/05/world/europe/coronavirus-finland-masks.html\">Finland</a> (prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/09/finland-anoints-sanna-martin-34-as-worlds-youngest-serving-prime-minister\">Sanna Marin</a> is the head of a coalition whose four other parties are all led by women) are also doing noteworthy jobs in containing coronavirus.</p> <p>Correlation is obviously not causation. Being a woman doesn\u2019t automatically make you better at handling a global pandemic. Nor does it automatically <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/21/barack-obama-women-better-than-men-myths-leaders\">make you a better leader</a>; suggesting it does reinforces sexist and unhelpful ideas that women are innately more compassionate and cooperative.</p> <p>What is true, however, is that women generally have to be better in order to <em>become</em> leaders; we are held to far higher standards than men. Women are rarely able to fail up in the way men can; you have to be twice as good as a man in order to be taken half as seriously. You have to work twice as hard. With a few notable exceptions (*cough* Ivanka Trump *cough*), you\u2019ve got to be overqualified for a top job.</p> <p>A surplus of qualifications isn\u2019t exactly a problem Donald Trump has. America\u2019s response to the coronavirus crisis is arguably the worst in the world \u2013 although Britain also gets an honourable mention here. Instead of expertise, the Trump administration has led with ego. While thousands of Americans die, Trump <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/492084-trump-slams-wsj-for-failing-to-mention-ratings-in-critical-editorial\">tweets about his TV ratings</a>. Instead of cooperating, Trump is lashing out at the press and state leaders. It\u2019s hard to imagine Hillary Clinton responding to a crisis in this way without being immediately impeached. Which raises the question: are some men simply too emotional to be leaders?</p> <h2>Women using code words to escape domestic violence</h2> <p>There\u2019s been a huge spike in domestic violence around the world because of the Covid-19 lockdown. With help harder to access, people are finding creative workarounds. A new <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/02/europe/domestic-violence-coronavirus-lockdown-intl/index.html\">initiative in France</a> encourages people experiencing abuse to say a codeword (\u201cmask19\u201d) to a pharmacist at a drugstore to get help. In the UK the Silent Solution system allows victims to alert police without saying anything; you dial 999 operators and then press 55.</p> <h2>Rihanna has donated $2.1m to help domestic violence victims in lockdown</h2> <p>While some celebrities are responding to the crisis with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/31/the-coronavirus-crisis-has-exposed-the-ugly-truth-about-celebrity-culture-and-capitalism\">cringey renditions of Imagine</a>, Rihanna has opened her wallet to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/10/rihanna-1-point-coronavirus-lockdown-donation-los-angeles-domestic-violence\">help the most vulnerable</a>. Last month she worked with Jay-Z\u2019s foundation to donate $2m to support undocumented workers, prisoners, homeless people, the elderly and children of frontline health workers in Los Angeles and New York.</p> <h2>Fertility treatments delayed amid pandemic</h2> <p>The coronavirus crisis has <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-pandemic-fertility-treatments-women-worry-they-may-miss-chance-to-have-child/\">shuttered most fertility clinics</a>, leading to heartache and uncertainty for people needing help to conceive. \u201cI\u2019m numb at this point,\u201d one woman told CBS News. \u201cIt\u2019s the norm with IVF that there\u2019s ups and downs, but you never get used to the phone call that says \u2026 you can\u2019t move on.\u201d There have been a lot of jokes about a \u2018quarantine baby boom\u2019, but for some people an extended lockdown may mean they\u2019ll never be able to conceive.</p> <h2>Kayleigh McEnany is Trump\u2019s new press secretary</h2> <p>Kayleigh McEnany is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/08/kayleigh-mcenany-donald-trump-press-secretary-quotes\">Trump\u2019s fourth spokesperson</a> and replaces Stephanie Grisham, who did not hold a single press conference during her time on the job. As you would expect from a mouthpiece for Trump, McEnany has a history of spouting racist lies. She has embraced birtherism and once tweeted: \u201cHow I Met Your Brother -- Never mind, forgot he\u2019s still in that hut in Kenya. #ObamaTVShows.\u201d</p> <h2>Rental rooms to avoid \u2018coronavirus divorces\u2019</h2> <p>Kasoku, a Japanese version of Airbnb, has found a new revenue stream during the Covid-19 crisis: <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Society/Startup-offers-rental-rooms-to-avoid-coronavirus-divorces\">avoiding-divorces-as-a-service</a>.

It guides you through the whole process, from starting a sourdough mother to ready-to-eat baked loaf.</p> <h2><strong>C is for clay</strong></h2> <p>For a child-friendly, kitchen-table project, make your own air-dry clay from corn flour, water and bicarbonate of soda. In a pan, combine two cups of bicarbonate of soda with one cup of cornflour and 1.5 cups of cold water. Mix until smooth, then heat gently for five minutes until it has formed a ball. Transfer to a bowl, cover with a damp cloth and allow to cool completely before you start to shape the clay. Your shape or sculpture will take up to 48 hours to dry fully, then it can be painted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7b798a042d1cd6b3e9e6d334746db6f15993fd2d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b798a042d1cd6b3e9e6d334746db6f15993fd2d/0_103_1772_3878/457..jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of man sitting on photo of a dandelion\" width=\"457\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration: Nishant Choksi/The Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Nishant Choksi/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>D is for dandelions</strong></h2> <p>Edible<strong>, </strong>beautiful, useful \u2013 why banish dandelions when bees love the blooms and the seeds are manna to goldfinches? Give the weedkiller a rest and let your grass glow with yellow.</p> <h2><strong>\u2026 and deep decluttering</strong></h2> <p>Now is the perfect time for a satisfying declutter. This can be hard to do on your own, so if you are isolating with others, get them to hold up your broken tools/unworn shoes/old school books and ask: \u201cDo you need this?\u201d If you don\u2019t touch the object, you are more likely to get rid of it. Work in categories (books, toys, clothes, knick-knacks) and set aside things to be recycled or donated later.</p> <h2><strong>E is for envelopes</strong></h2> <p>Catch up on letters<strong>.</strong> Find the addresses of everyone you know who lives in a different part of the world/country and write letters or postcards. Get kids involved: decorate a set of blank postcards with pressed flowers \u2013 even nicer for the person who receives your letter.</p> <h2><strong>F is for food</strong></h2> <p>Turn your garden, balcony or windowsill into a productive patch. Self-sufficiency takes time and space you probably don\u2019t have, so focus on growing fresh, flavour-packed leaves: think tasty garnishes rather than a substitute for the supermarket.</p> <p>If you have a sunny windowsill, try sowing coriander and fenugreek seeds in a shallow indoor tray of compost, and harvest once the seedlings are around 3cm tall. Buy a three-tier sprouter from the <a href=\"https://www.organiccatalogue.com/products/3-tier-sprouter_783164\">Organic Gardening Catalogue</a> (\u00a329.99) to expand your options.</p> <p>Pea shoots are another super-easy windowsill crop that is big enough for small fingers to sow. Buy a box of dried peas, soak in warm water for a few hours, then sow into a tray of damp compost and cover with another 2cm of compost. Once the shoots reach 5-10cm long, snip above the lowest set of leaves and the plant will regrow for multiple harvests.

Anything over two years old can be shredded and discarded (tax-related paperwork such as payslips, P45s and P60s must be kept for at least 22 months from the end of the tax year to which they relate). Keep your new system slimline by opting for paperless billing.</p> <h2><strong>G is for garden centres</strong></h2> <p>All the spring plant shows \u2013 a major selling outlet for nurseries \u2013 are cancelled, which means there is stock that needs to be sold.

Start \u2013 or finish \u2013 hanging a gallery wall by digging out posters, prints, postcards, photos, children\u2019s drawings, or any memorabilia that makes you happy. Pinterest has heaps of gallery wall layout ideas, and there are online framers such as <a href=\"https://www.easy-frame.co.uk/\">Easy Frame</a>.</p> <h2><strong>H is for free houseplants</strong></h2> <p>Take an avocado stone, wrap it in damp kitchen roll and place in a clear plastic bag in a warm dark place \u2013 leave a small opening in the bag for air circulation. Check every few days, keeping the paper damp, and once the stone has cracked open and sprouted, pot in some damp houseplant compost, the top just proud of the surface. You will end up with a pretty foliage plant.</p> <h2><strong>\u2026 and homemade cleaning products</strong></h2> <p>Order a giant bottle of castile soap and make multipurpose surface spray cleaner, scented with your favourite essential oils. \u201cKids love getting involved in this,\u201d says blogger Hannah Bullivant, who has been making her own cleaning products for nearly a decade. \u201cIt\u2019s like making potions.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>I is for ikebana</strong></h2> <p>The Japanese art of flower arranging might be just the kind of mindful, minimalist, creative activity you need right now.

Remember to poke or drill holes in the base for drainage. Buy a paper potter (\u00a310.98 from the <a href=\"https://www.theplasticfreeshop.co.uk/useful-stuff/paper-potter-original\">Plastic Free Shop</a>) to make biodegradable pots for seeds.</p> <h2><strong>K is for kitchen cupboards</strong></h2> <p>Frugality and making food go further are key just now.

A mini reflector \u2013 a piece of card covered in aluminium foil and set behind a tray of seedlings \u2013 will help to bounce existing light in their direction.</p> <h2><strong>M is for mud kitchen</strong></h2> <p>For many parents, long weeks of full-time childcare stretch ahead: if you have a garden, balcony, back step or patio, a mud kitchen can eat up hours for younger children. An old table, a washing-up bowl and a few utensils are all you need for a bit of sensory play; but for something fancier, check out <a href=\"https://mudkitchens.co.uk/\">Mud Kitchens</a>.</p> <h2><strong>N is for notes</strong></h2> <p>If you have a garden, some areas are bound to lack spring cheer; could you brighten them up for next year with crocuses, add early tulips and daffodils, enliven bare tables with pots of grape hyacinths and irises? Yes, but will you remember come bulb-planting time? Make notes and take snaps of the relevant spots as an aide-memoire, and spring 2021 will be stunning.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"359db559de284f11a36808110d10c3d81cbcaa69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/359db559de284f11a36808110d10c3d81cbcaa69/0_48_2953_2857/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of woman looking up at a photo of a rose\" width=\"1000\" height=\"967\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">R is for top dressing roses.

Ros Humphries, founder of the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thenaturaldyeworks/?hl=en\">Natural Dyeworks</a>, says: \u201cOnion skins are rich in tannins, so a good project for beginners. Wash your chosen fabric with a pH-neutral soap. Fill a large pan with water and add two large handfuls of onion skins. Simmer for an hour, then strain through a muslin cloth or tea towel. Wet your fabric, then immerse in the dye. Bring to just below simmer and \u2018cook\u2019 for up to an hour. Leave to cool overnight for the strongest shades. Expect warm yellows from brown onions and peachy pinks from red onions.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>P is for perennial vegetables</strong></h2> <p>Seedlings take up loads of room: perennial vegetables bypass the sowing stage and are low maintenance, too. Some sound exotic and aren\u2019t so easy to get hold of, such as Egyptian walking onions and sea beet; there is also the more familiar horseradish, Jerusalem artichoke and rhubarb. Some common garden perennials that are considered ornamental are also edible, including the young shoots of <em>Centranthus ruber</em> (red valerian) or of <em>Hosta sieboldii, </em>and the buds and flowers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jul/03/alys-fowler-day-lilies\">day lilies</a> (<em>Hemerocallis</em>).

Whether it\u2019s a meal for one or a family of six, lay the table to the max.\u201d She suggests dusting off the best china and glasses, making calligraphy place names and menu cards, and arranging individual flower stems in bud jars down the table in little groups. \u201cIf you can\u2019t get flowers, herbs in pots will do the job nicely. Make iced biscuits and use them as part of the place setting.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>U is for umbellifers</strong></h2> <p>If you see a plant with umbrella-like clusters of tiny flowers that look like a landing pad, it\u2019s probably a member of the umbellifer family, which includes cow parsley and wild carrot. Parasitoid wasps love feeding on the flowers, and these are important predators who keep down common pests such as aphids and caterpillars. Bellifers often have lacy foliage that provides spots for insects to cool off and shelter, too. Sow herb umbellifers such as coriander, dill, parsley and fennel among vegetables to help keep crops healthy.</p> <h2><strong>\u2026 and upcycling</strong></h2> <p>Paint-stripping, sanding down, priming and repainting: changing the colour of wooden furniture or fittings is the perfect job for isolation. But before you paint an old chair blue or brighten the inside of your kitchen cupboards with glossy yellow, check out the design website Remodelista\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.remodelista.com/posts/expert-advice-how-to-paint-furniture/\">advice on painting furniture</a> (which suggests you start by downloading an audio book). If you feel experimental, they also have ideas for achieving <a href=\"https://www.remodelista.com/posts/how-to-paint-distress-furniture-diy-expert-advice/\">finishes such as crackle glazes and feign</a><a href=\"https://www.remodelista.com/posts/how-to-paint-distress-furniture-diy-expert-advice/\"> patinas</a>.</p> <h2><strong>V is for vertical</strong></h2> <p>If every flat surface in your home is taken up with plants, it\u2019s time to move up. If you don\u2019t want to drill holes in the ceiling to hang them, repurposed hat stands, freestanding clothes racks and even drinks trolleys will make flexible, space-saving digs for your plant.</p> <h2><strong>\u2026 and vinegar</strong></h2> <p>Mix equal parts of white vinegar and water in a spray bottle and clean your windows inside and out. Talking of windows, wash the curtains, too, and any other removable fabric covers (pillow, mattress, cushion) that have evaded the laundry pile of late.</p> <h2><strong>W is for wildflower hour</strong></h2> <p>If you can\u2019t go outside to smell the flowers, check out <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=@wildflower_hour&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Esearch\">@wildflower_hour </a>on Twitter: every Sunday night from 8-9pm is a bonanza of native plant pictures and chat.</p> <h2><strong>\u2026 and WFH</strong></h2> <p>If the novelty of working from home is wearing off, check your desk is positioned in front of a window: natural light and views will soothe, as will a plant and a jug of water (you might forget to rehydrate at home). For more advice on staying connected and motivated, visit the <a href=\"https://medium.com/wellcome-digital/working-from-home-tips-tricks-and-motivation-cff29f6f0252\">Wellcome Trust</a>.</p> <h2><strong>X is for xerophyte</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/aug/30/alys-fowler-sempervivums\">Houseleeks, or sempervivums</a>,<em> </em>are the tough customers of the succulent world, hardy in British winters and just as beautiful as their tender relatives, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/21/succulents-gardening-james-wong\">the echeverias</a>. Plant a few houseleek rosettes in a shallow dish of gritty compost or in a south-facing windowbox to enjoy all year round.</p> <h2><strong>\u2026 and xylography</strong></h2> <p>Xylography is the art of carving shapes on wood for printing. Whether you carve a design into wood, lino or a potato, block printing is a soothing activity to do alone or with children. Textile designer <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-FkijmFw1K/\">Molly Mahon</a> suggests: \u201cStart with a simple pattern, such as a star, to get you going. Another good idea, if you can get out into nature, is to draw round a leaf \u2013 this shape makes a great printing pattern.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Y is for yellow leaves</strong></h2> <p>Lavishing all your spare time on caring for houseplants is no bad thing, but don\u2019t overdo it with the watering can.</p> <p>Waterlogged roots may not be visible, but yellowing leaves are an early warning sign that all is not well below the surface. Counterintuitively, wilting can also be a sign of overwatering. Take the plant out of its pot, cut away any slimy roots and repot into fresh houseplant potting mix, making sure there are plenty of drainage holes.</p> <p>For plants with leathery leaves such as monstera (Swiss cheese plant) and philodendrons, take a damp cloth and gently wipe the surface of each leaf: furry leaves such as African violets and spiny cacti can be cleaned gently with a dry, clean, soft makeup brush or paintbrush.</p> <h2><strong>Z is for zinnias</strong></h2> <p>If you would love to see really vibrant colour in the garden this summer, zinnias will lift your spirits. Native to Mexico, they come in many glorious hues and are easy to grow here. They also make stunning cut flowers. <a href=\"https://www.chilternseeds.co.uk/\">Chiltern Seeds</a> has a great range of seeds, or buy them as <a href=\"https://www.suttons.co.uk/Gardening/Flower-Plants/All-Flower-Plants/Zinnia-Plants---Zahara_MH2995.htm#252175\">plug plants</a> from Suttons.</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>This crisis has revealed how arbitrary the phrase \u201clow skilled\u201d is: how we value people, their rights, what they\u2019re paid and the conditions they work in is all wrong. For all its warm words about key workers, the government should be reminded of this.</p> <p>The day Dominic Raab encouraged us all to clap for the workers who are risking their lives to keep society going, the government restated that some of those same people won\u2019t be allowed in the country come January 2021. While Priti Patel is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/08/priti-patel-accused-of-avoiding-mps-scrutiny-during-national-crisis\">conspicuously absent</a> \u2013 notably on immigration issues \u2013 the department she oversees decided now was the time to reiterate that as part of its new immigration rules, \u201clow-skilled\u201d people <a href=\"https://www.freemovement.org.uk/government-we-dont-want-low-skilled-workers-after-the-pandemic/\">would not be able to apply for a UK work visa</a>.</p> <p>Millions of key workers in the UK are migrants \u2013 approximately 23% of all <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/articles/internationalmigrationandthehealthcareworkforce/2019-08-15\">hospital staff</a>, including 29% of doctors and 18% of nurses, 20% of agricultural workers, more than 40% of <a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/blog/migrant-workers-and-coronavirus\">food production workers</a> and 18% of <a href=\"https://www.independentage.org/policy-research/research-reports/moved-to-care-impact-of-migration-on-adult-social-care-workforce\">care</a><a href=\"https://www.independentage.org/policy-research/research-reports/moved-to-care-impact-of-migration-on-adult-social-care-workforce\"> workers</a>, rising to 59% in London. These are the human beings who, for decades, politicians have blamed for holding down wages, ruining \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/17/four-in-10-people-think-multiculturalism-undermines-british-culture-immigration\">British culture</a>\u201d and overburdening public services.</p> <p>If the government forges ahead with its plans, recognising them as key workers will be just a momentary suspension of the norm. Many of them were dismissed as low skilled before the crisis, and it seems they will be once again when it\u2019s over.</p> <p>The government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/18/uk-to-close-door-to-non-english-speakers-and-unskilled-workers\">post-Brexit immigration plans</a> are a mix of salary thresholds and a clear determination to stop people it deems to be low skilled coming to the UK. It seems that it plans to change the system in some ways, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/19/immigration-proposal-english-language\">expanding</a> an already unfair, discriminatory system for non-EU migrants to include their EU counterparts. Swept up into this category will likely be some of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/07/immigration-policy-will-bar-half-a-million-care-workers-from-eu\">people </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/07/immigration-policy-will-bar-half-a-million-care-workers-from-eu\">it is praising now</a>: the migrant care workers, hospital porters, bus drivers and cleaners who are keeping us safe and keeping society functioning.</p> <p>Your value, the rights you can access, whether you can settle in this country: none of that should be decided by your job or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jul/04/golden-visa-immigration-deal-british-citizenship-home-office\">how much money</a> you have in your bank account. But neither should it take a crisis to make this clear; you shouldn\u2019t have to risk your life or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/06/coronavirus-crisis-nhs-not-drained-migrants-sustained-died-frontline\">die trying to help others</a> to be seen as a human being.</p> <p>The sacrifices people are making should be recognised and remembered. But their humanity should not depend on how they help \u201cus\u201d. For decades this has been exactly the kind of immigration system politicians have argued for: one where migrants who benefit \u201cus\u201d and \u201cour economy\u201d are \u201callowed\u201d to come here, and everyone else is a problem. People moving to the UK have for too long been treated as disposable commodities, their rights determined by how useful they are seen to be. This is the very essence of the points-based system.</p> <p>That\u2019s why the government sometimes chooses to apply the rules differently to particular groups of people. It can, for instance, give out <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/nhs-frontline-workers-visas-extended-so-they-can-focus-on-fighting-coronavirus\">automatic one-year visa extensions</a> to some health workers, at the same time as doubling down on the immigration system that <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/coronavirus-nhs-visa-extensions-uk-doctors-nurses-a9444056.html\">dismisses other key workers</a>.</p> <p>So, if a shift is happening in society, it can\u2019t just be piecemeal. We cannot repeat the same dehumanising ideas, where people are either framed as \u201ccockroaches\u201d and \u201cillegals\u201d, or as \u201cproductive\u201d and \u201cuseful\u201d workers; bad migrants v good migrants. Recognising low-skilled workers as key workers should be a starting point, not an end point, to change the immigration debate. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-inequality-managers-zoom-cleaners-offices\">Coronavirus is not some great leveller: it is exacerbating inequality right now | Owen Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The government\u2019s treatment of all migrants matters. As it has reissued statements on low-skilled workers, it has been remarkably quiet on certain key migrants\u2019 rights issues during this crisis. Over the past few weeks I\u2019ve spoken to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/30/hostile-environment-covonavirus-crisis-britain-migrants\">people who are terrified</a> about becoming destitute because the conditions attached to their visa bar them from accessing financial support. There are those who are scared to access healthcare because of the hostile environment. And the charity Detention Action has found that not only are people still being put in immigration detention, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/coronavirus-detention-immigration-removal-centre-brook-house-home-office-a9458206.html\">some are being detained</a> when presenting with coronavirus symptoms. These people are consistently overlooked because they aren\u2019t seen to matter.</p> <p>But if recognising our common humanity is something we can do when Boris Johnson is admitted to intensive care, the same should be possible for all people, regardless of their immigration status. All migrants\u2019 rights should matter. Not just in a crisis, but all the time.</p> <p>\u2022 Maya Goodfellow is a writer and academic, and the author of Hostile Environment: How Immigrants Became Scapegoats</p>",

government\u2019s public health measures.</em></p> \n   <p><em>Players can stay at home ... but could be asked to move if they live in a virus hotspot.</em></p> \n   <p><em>They will also be asked to

  "<p>I\u2019ve been reading a lot of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/nora-ephron\" title=\"\">Nora Ephron</a> recently because, well, who needs a reason? Although in this case, there is one. I miss spending time with my friends \u2013 in person, that is, as opposed to through a screen. My friends are, in the vast main, funny and smart women, and in the absence of meeting up with them in the pub or park, I get into bed every night with Ephron, the smartest, funniest and most female writer of all, who wrote just as brilliantly about feminist politics as she did about her frustration that her <a href=\"https://longreads.com/2015/07/06/a-few-words-about-breasts-from-nora-ephron/\" title=\"\">breasts weren\u2019t bigger</a>. (Honestly, Nora, the breast thing? It\u2019s overrated.)</p> <p>When Ephron died in 2012, obituarists were spoiled for choice about which of her writings to quote: a pithy line from Heartburn, her novel about her divorce, or an irresistible bit from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/when-harry-met-sally\" title=\"\">When Harry Met Sally</a>, which is every single line of that film. (\u201cA Sheldon can do your taxes. If you need a root canal, Sheldon\u2019s your man. But humping and pumping is not Sheldon\u2019s strong suit.\u201d I have a condition that makes it physically impossible for me to mention WHMS without quoting it.)</p> <p>Yet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jun/27/nora-ephron-how-miss-her\" title=\"\">every journalist who covered her death</a> quoted from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jun/27/nora-ephron-miss-wont-miss\" title=\"\">the then little-known lists</a> about what she would and wouldn\u2019t miss after she died, from her final book, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/10/magazine/nora-ephrons-final-act.html\" title=\"\">I Remember Nothing</a>, which she wrote when she and almost no one else knew she was dying. What made those lists so affecting was that they were mainly small things, both specific and entirely relatable, like all of Ephron\u2019s writing. Bras, polls and panels on Women in Film are not currently being missed by Ephron; but dinner with friends, fireworks and pie are.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been thinking about those lists, not because I\u2019m dying, but because normal life has, for now, died for all of us. I have gone through the five stages of grief: shock that I am living through a global plague; fear for those I love; sadness about all the cancelled plans; irritation with the lack of online delivery slots; delusion that I\u2019ll spend the next three months reading Proust instead of staring at my phone. (A mix of existential terror and petty flouncing sums up my feelings during All This.)</p> <p>I am lucky: no one in my family is sick (yet), but I miss normal life, when I didn\u2019t leap in terror any time someone near me coughed, like a Victorian maiden. And yet, without wishing to seek out a nonexistent silver lining, there have also been things I don\u2019t miss. They are all small things, but it\u2019s only by focusing on the details that life feels manageable right now. Once I start thinking about the macro (my parents, my kids) instead of the micro (cancelled holidays, postponed cinema dates), hello, 3am insomnia.</p> <p>Yoga classes have become much more Zen. Instead of having to schlep to a studio, internally grumping if my favourite spot in the room (front right corner) is taken and then hating the person on the next mat for being so much better, I do online lessons alone in my bedroom. I always get the best spot and I am definitely the best in the room. So much time and internalised fuming saved!</p> <p>When I was pregnant with my twins during a heatwave, I resented the impediments to my physical freedom. But then I realised the upside: no one could give me any grief for having an elective C-section \u2013 or hiring six gold-painted men to carry me around on a plinth, should I so desire. Self-isolation has, weirdly, brought a similar release. No longer do I have to feel guilty for not going to this or that play, as I chronically do, even though I hate the theatre because I can never figure out when to eat dinner (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/commentisfree/2020/jan/04/forget-cats-marriage-story-musical-highlight-of-my-holiday\" title=\"\">Sondheim musicals</a> are the exception). Now I have all the time in the world for dinner. There is a freedom in imprisonment: the essentials take root, the flotsam floats away.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/21/i-grew-up-watching-disaster-movies-heres-what-ive-learned\">I grew up watching disaster movies. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned | Hadley Freeman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Speaking of the essentials, I can exclusively confirm that it is not easy to work with three children under five running around the house. In my lower moments, I have looked at the comparative freedom of my childfree friends with the same envy with which they now look at my garden. But it is lovely to eat three meals a day with my kids, and to see how much they love it, too. Self-isolating with their parents is, I have realised, a small child\u2019s fantasy come to life. (This is possibly less true of teenagers. Turns out my decision to wait to have kids until I was 102 really worked out for the best.)</p> <p>Here, then, is the official list of things I do and do not miss.</p> <p><strong>What I miss</strong> The first sip of a cool drink in a dark bar; bumping into a friend; getting a late cab home and listening to Magic FM; booking holidays, especially with friends; ice-cream in a cone.</p> <p><strong>What I don\u2019t </strong>Small talk; feeling guilty about not having people over for dinner; cold afternoons in the playground; ready-made sandwiches.</p> <p>Yes, small things. But Harry realised he loved Sally when he loved that it took her an hour and a half to order a sandwich. As Ephron understood better than anyone, when life feels overwhelming, it\u2019s the insignificant details that are the most revealing.</p>",

  "<p>At a time when we\u2019re mostly cooped up inside, looking longingly out of the window at the first blush of spring, it\u2019s fair to say a streaming service called Tropical on Demand pretty much has us at hello. Before you settle in for a marathon of beachy, pina colada-infused escapism, however, readjust your expectations a little. A small but enticing new service, Tropical on Demand is the VOD offshoot of Cinema Tropical, a leading distributor of independent Latin American cinema in the US \u2013 happily made accessible to an international online audience.</p> <p>Launched at the end of March, it\u2019s one of a surfeit of enterprising \u201cvirtual cinemas\u201d set up by arthouse distributors in response to the coronavirus shutdown: while many bigger films have opted to delay until cinemas reopen, others see the advantage of a captive at-home audience rapidly cycling through their viewing options and open to adventurous alternatives. At the glossy end of this market, you have something like <a href=\"https://www.curzonhomecinema.com/\">Curzon Home Cinema</a>: long prepared for such a crisis, even if they could never have known what that crisis would be, now serving its cinema-starved users with A-list new art films until relative normality resumes.</p> <p>But at the maverick end, Tropical on Demand offers a <a href=\"https://www.cinematropical.com/the-cinema-tropical-collection\">devoted online platform</a> \u2013 working via the Vimeo site \u2013 to films that would still be fighting for visibility in the very best of circumstances: it seems unlikely that many of the films in their curated collection would ever reach British cinemas. New and original Latin American directorial voices are given priority here, plucked from the less spotlight reaches of recent festival programmes. Their first five selections span Mexico, Bolivia, Argentina and the Dominican Republic, flipping between fiction and documentary. Some are more easily approachable than others; all are exciting, illuminating visions.</p> <p>The programme launched a fortnight ago with <strong><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/ondemand/awayfrommeaning/402529167\">Away from Meaning</a></strong>, an achingly intimate personal portrait by Mexican documentary-maker Olivia Luengas, centred on her sister Liliana\u2019s struggle with borderline personality disorder. Luengas explores a lifetime of mistreatment and misdiagnosis by medical authorities, and her family\u2019s own difficulties in supporting and understanding Liliana\u2019s mental health. There\u2019s no way to make this easy viewing, but the acute tenderness of its perspective gives it light and depth. Following its free 24-hour streaming premiere on the Cinema Tropical website, it\u2019s now available to watch for a modest \u00a33.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtZMJh26DUE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XtZMJh26DUE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtZMJh26DUE\">Watch a trailer for Everything Else</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>A second documentary, <strong><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/ondemand/stillburn/402607913\">Still Burn</a></strong>, covers further complicated family matters: director <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/maocine\">Mauricio Alfredo Ovando</a> is the grandson of the former Bolivian dictator Alfredo Ovando Cand\u00eda, and his film engages thoughtfully with that thorny legacy.

Awash in sleekly haunting imagery and very loosely inspired by Bart\u00f3k\u2019s opera <em>Bluebeard\u2019s Castle</em>, it\u2019s a study of adolescent women in emotional limbo that has the eerie, cryptic energy of a genuine daydream.</p> <p>Natalia Almada\u2019s gradually transfixing <strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtZMJh26DUE\">Everything Else</a></strong>, meanwhile, is unexpectedly a film for the era of self-isolation. A character study of a sixtysomething government bureaucrat \u2013 beautifully played by Adriana Barraza, an Oscar nominee 14 years ago for <em>Babel</em> and showcased all too rarely since \u2013 attempting to extricate herself from the solitary invisibility of her own life, it\u2019s a piercing reminder that social distancing isn\u2019t a new concept to all. It dovetails thematically with <strong><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/400317321\">T\u00fa Y Yo</a></strong>, Natalia Cabral and Oriol Estrada\u2019s perceptive documentary about the temperamental relationship between an elderly widow and her younger, long-suffering domestic servant: an essay on human connection that bristles with unresolved class politics.</p> <p>It\u2019s a promising, provocative first batch of picks from a streaming initiative that will hopefully last longer than the pandemic that initially necessitated it. The site is further rounded out with a section of <a href=\"https://www.cinematropical.com/daily-recommendations\">daily viewing recommendations</a> from the diverse Latin American pool, including a beguiling Lucrecia Martel short and a past pick from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/15/guy-lodge-dvds-childs-pose\">this very column</a>: the smart, eco-minded school bus documentary<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5knpkw_94rA\"> </a><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5knpkw_94rA\">La Camioneta</a></strong>.

  "<p>Unwanted by her father and so abandoned by her mother, in 1953 a baby girl is found under a mulberry tree in wealthy north Tehran. Carrying her home to the impoverished tenements of the southern city, Behrouz \u2013 an army driver who, as a motherless boy, pretended to be a mother himself \u2013 names her Aria. It\u2019s usually a boy\u2019s name meaning \u201cthe Iranian race\u201d, but Behrouz intends the musical sense of the word: \u201clittle tales, cries in the night\u201d. This ambiguity continues, for as Aria grows, she wavers between opposed categories: rich and poor, educated and illiterate, orthodox Shia Muslim and something else. Years later Behrouz reflects on his charge: \u201cShe had somehow acquired the ability to be two things in one.\u201d<br><br>His neighbours are generally hostile to this illegitimate child. \u201cI bet with those blue eyes that girl\u2019s a Jew or a jinn\u2019s daughter,\u201d says one. And Behrouz\u2019s wife, Zahra, the first in a line of false or flawed mother figures, beats and neglects the orphan, often locking her out on the balcony. Her bad behaviour is glaring, but Zahra turns out to be a complex character. One of the many strengths of this strong debut by Iranian-Canadian novelist Nazanine Hozar is that every character is contextualised and therefore humanised by an explanatory backstory.</p> <p>And the balcony isn\u2019t so bad. Here Aria is able to communicate with Kamran, the neighbour\u2019s cleft-lipped son, who climbs a tree to deliver bracelets and sweets to her. His love for Aria will develop through the years, and his bitterness after rejection help shape his later career.</p> <p>Aria finally escapes from Zahra, and makes an upward jump in class when she is adopted by Fereshteh, childless heir of a family who are ex-Zoroastrians, and once silversmiths to the shahs. Aria calls her \u201cMana\u201d; almost but not quite her Mama. The minor characters populating Fereshteh\u2019s urban palace are distinct and memorable \u2013 the foul-mouthed old servant Massoomeh, Fereshteh\u2019s brief husband Mahmoud, and Uncle Jafar who has OCD and tunes pianos, polishes coins and washes newspapers. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Tehran\u2019s diversity is expertly conjured \u2013 its cinemas, processions, opium dealers, Jews, Christians, Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds and Muslims</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>By now a feisty child, prone to throwing things around and asking embarrassing questions, Aria settles nonetheless into a comfortable north Tehran life of parks, ice-cream parlours and modern schooling. Of her new friends, Hamlet, son of a rich Armenian businessman, is briefly abducted by an angry mob, and Mitra is deprived of her father, arrested for his leftist activism.</p> <p>If Aria embodies Iranian complexity, this story of her young life serves as a vehicle for the national story of the quarter-century leading up to the 1979 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/iranian-revolution/2010/feb/11/all\">Islamic revolution</a>. Hozar shows rather than tells the reader of the economic divisions and swelling resentments that precipitated the change. The social tension rises steadily as the novel progresses, adding to its compelling pace. And her method of describing the paranoid and increasingly febrile political environment from the perspectives of children and teenagers is surprisingly effective, communicating key historical information alongside a general sense of mounting confusion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dec91e6820dbd96398b9563c265299c80615a435\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dec91e6820dbd96398b9563c265299c80615a435/0_121_2349_1410/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nazanine Hozar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nazanine Hozar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rafal Gerszak</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Details of Aria\u2019s origin are slowly revealed, and her fate changed, by a swirl of hints, secrets, letters and a mysterious stash of money. Tehran\u2019s diversity is expertly conjured in this section \u2013 its cinemas as well as its self-flagellating Ashura processions, its opium dealers on bicycles, its Polish immigrants, and Jews, Christians and Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds as well as Muslims.</p> <p>Perhaps the strongest character in this warm-hearted book is Behrouz: gentle, long-suffering and the one steady and reliable person in the flux of Aria\u2019s life. His stories told from the steering wheel \u2013 of the mythic king Rostam, the phoenix, Mount Damavand, the valley of the assassins \u2013 evoke the symbolic riches of Iranian culture accumulated over 7,000 years.</p> <p>But, as Behrouz observes, \u201cwhen something is that old it begins to crack\u201d. By the late 1970s, people from the university to the bazaar, from north Tehranto the south city, are engaged in political meetings, in which leftists and Islamists compete and cooperate. They distribute illicit cassettes on which speeches by the exiled Ayatollah Khomeini are hidden between songs by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/abba\">Abba</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/thebeatles\">the Beatles</a>. The final section takes in curfews, riots, food shortages and snipers on rooftops, and then Khomeini\u2019s triumphant return from exile, vowing that he doesn\u2019t seek power for himself.</p> <p>Aria is a hugely enjoyable book crammed with artful devices, described by Margaret Atwood as \u201ca <em>Doctor Zhivago</em> of Iran\u201d. Notwithstanding some slightly underwritten sections, its skilful blending of personal and political drama, along with its broad scope, richness of setting and vitality of character, gives it something of the quality of that epic.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Aria by Nazanine Hozar is published by Viking (\u00a314.99).

Few attempt a definitive review of a play after the first three scenes.</p> \n<p>Yet world leaders, diplomats and geopolitical analysts know they are living through epoch-making times and have one eye on the daily combat, the other on what this crisis will bequeath the world. Competing ideologies, power blocs, leaders and systems of social cohesion are being stress-tested in the court of world opinion.</p> \n<p>Already everyone in the global village is starting to draw lessons. In France, Macron has predicted \u201cthis period will have taught us a lot. Many certainties and convictions will be swept away. Many things that we thought were impossible are happening.

In Italy, the former prime minister Matteo Renzi has called for a commission into the future. In Hong Kong, graffiti reads: \u201cThere can be no return to normal because normal was the problem in the first place.\u201d Henry Kissinger, the US secretary of state under Richard Nixon, says rulers must prepare now to transition to a post-coronavirus world order.</p> \n<p>The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCHARDtalk/status/1243207828317274112?s=20\">said</a>: \u201cThe relationship between the biggest powers has never been as dysfunctional. Covid-19 is showing dramatically, either we join [together] ... or we can be defeated.\u201d</p> \n<p>The discussion in global thinktanks rages, not about cooperation, but whether the Chinese or the US will emerge as leaders of the post-coronavirus world.</p> \n<p>In the UK, the debate has been relatively insular. The outgoing Labour leadership briefly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/25/corbyn-uses-final-pmqs-press-johnson-coronavirus-response\">searched for vindication</a> in the evident rehabilitation of the state and its workforce. The definition of public service has been extended to include the delivery driver and the humble corner shop owner. Indeed, to be \u201ca nation of shopkeepers\u201d, the great Napoleonic insult, no longer looks so bad.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4816b01cc8da3ce90eb1f6db9d6c6f7058207192\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4816b01cc8da3ce90eb1f6db9d6c6f7058207192/0_255_5760_3456/1000..jpg\" alt=\"A potato delivery to Mr Crolla's fish and chip shop in Tranent, Scotland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The delivery driver has become an icon of public service in Britain during the coronavirus outbreak.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The obvious and widely drawn parallel has been, as so often in Britain, the second world war. In The Road to 1945, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/04/paul-addison-obituary\">Paul Addison</a>\u2019s definitive account of how the second world war helped turn Britain to the left, he quotes the diary of the journalist JL Hodson in September 1944: \u201cNo excuses any more for unemployment and slums and underfeeding. We have shown in this war we British don\u2019t muddle through. Using even half the vision and energy and invention and pulling together we\u2019ve done in this war and what is there we cannot do? We\u2019ve virtually exploded the argument of old fogies and Better Notters who said we cannot afford this and mustn\u2019t do that. Our heavy taxation and rationing of food has willy nilly achieved some levelling up of the nation.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the same vein, Boris Johnson has been forced to unleash the state, but the impact in Britain seems more noticeable on civil society than politics. The famously standoffish British are no longer bowling alone. The sense of communal effort, the volunteer health workers, the unBritish <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/pots-pans-passion-britons-clap-their-support-for-nhs-workers-again\">clapping on doorsteps</a>, all add to the sense that lost social capital is being reformed. But there is not yet much discussion of a new politics. Perhaps the nation, exhausted by Brexit, cannot cope with more introspection and upheaval.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In Europe, the US and Asia the discussion has broadened out. Public life may be at a standstill, but public debate has accelerated. Everything is up for debate \u2013 the trade-offs between a trashed economy and public health, the relative virtues of centralised or regionalised health systems, the exposed fragilities of globalisation, the future of the EU, populism, the inherent advantage of authoritarianism.</p> \n<p>It is as if the pandemic has turned into a competition for global leadership, and it will be the countries that most effectively respond to the crisis that will gain traction. Diplomats, operating out of emptied embassies, are busy defending their governments\u2019 handling of the crisis, and often take deep offence to criticism. National pride, and health, are at stake.<strong> </strong>Each country looks at their neighbour to see how quickly they are \u201cflattening the curve\u201d.</p> \n<p>The Crisis Group thinktank, in assessing how the virus will permanently change international politics, suggests: \u201cFor now we can discern two competing narratives gaining currency \u2013 one in which the lesson is that countries ought to come together to better defeat Covid-19, and one in which the lesson is that countries need to stand apart in order to better protect themselves from it.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe crisis also represents a stark test of the competing claims of liberal and illiberal states to better manage extreme social distress. As the pandemic unfolds it will test not only the operational capacities of organisations like the WHO and the UN but also the basic assumptions about the values and political bargains that underpin them.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ebc8c583b87d36fcabd9c92e18e046d599bfb23a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebc8c583b87d36fcabd9c92e18e046d599bfb23a/0_55_4330_2597/1000..jpg\" alt=\"A Russian plane delivers medical equipment to Spain\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Russian plane delivers medical equipment to Spain.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jos\u00e9 Jordan/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Many are already claiming that the east has won this war of competing narratives. The South Korean philosopher Byung-Chul Han, in an influential essay <a href=\"https://elpais.com/ideas/2020-03-21/la-emergencia-viral-y-el-mundo-de-manana-byung-chul-han-el-filosofo-surcoreano-que-piensa-desde-berlin.html\">in El Pa</a><a href=\"https://elpais.com/ideas/2020-03-21/la-emergencia-viral-y-el-mundo-de-manana-byung-chul-han-el-filosofo-surcoreano-que-piensa-desde-berlin.html\">\u00eds</a>, has argued the victors are the \u201cAsian states like Japan, Korea, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan or Singapore that have an authoritarian mentality which comes from their cultural tradition [of] Confucianism. People are less rebellious and more obedient than in Europe. They trust the state more. Daily life is much more organised. Above all, to confront the virus Asians are strongly committed to digital surveillance. The epidemics in Asia are fought not only by virologists and epidemiologists, but also computer scientists and big data specialists.\u201d</p> \n<p>He predicts: \u201cChina will now be able to sell its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/the-new-normal-chinas-excessive-coronavirus-public-monitoring-could-be-here-to-stay\">digital police state</a> as a model of success against the pandemic. China will display the superiority of its system even more proudly.\u201d He claims western voters, attracted to safety and community, might be willing to sacrifice those liberties. There is little liberty in being forced to spend spring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/uks-covid-19-lockdown-could-crumble-as-frustration-grows-police-warn\">shut in your own flat</a>.</p> \n<p>Indeed, China is already on a victory lap of sorts, believing it has deftly repositioned itself from the culprit to the world\u2019s saviour. A new generation of young assertive Chinese diplomats have taken to social media to assert their country\u2019s superiority. Michel Duclos, the former French ambassador now at the Institut Montaigne, has accused China of \u201cshamelessly trying to capitalise on the country\u2019s \u2018victory against the virus\u2019 to promote its political system. The kind of undeclared cold war that had been brewing for some time shows its true face under the harsh light of Covid-19.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ba9786c6-c779-4063-8bf9-1d3009eb7c70\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3qV7R2iYVXg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Harvard international relations theorist Stephen Walt thinks China may succeed. Offering a first take<a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/03/united-states-can-still-win-coronavirus-pandemic-power/\"> to Foreign Policy magazine</a>, he suggests: \u201cCoronavirus will accelerate the shift of power and influence from west to east. South Korea and Singapore have shown the best response and China has managed well in the aftermath of its initial mistakes. The governments\u2019 response in Europe and the US has been very sceptical and likely to weaken the power of the western brand.\u201d</p> \n<p>Many on the European left, such as the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj \u017di\u017eek, also fear an authoritarian contagion, predicting in the west \u201ca new barbarism with a human face \u2013 ruthless survivalist measures enforced with regret and even sympathy, but legitimised by expert opinions\u201d.</p> \n<p>By contrast, Shivshankar Menon, a visiting professor at Ashoka University in India, says: \u201cExperience so far shows that authoritarians or populists are no better at handling the pandemic. Indeed, the countries that responded early and successfully, such as Korea and Taiwan, have been democracies \u2013 not those run by populist or authoritarian leaders.\u201d</p> \n<p>Francis Fukuyama concurs: \u201cThe major dividing line in effective crisis response will not place autocracies on one side and democracies on the other. The crucial determinant in performance will not be the type of regime, but the state\u2019s capacity and, above all, trust in government.\u201d He has praised Germany and South Korea.</p> \n<p>South Korea is in fact selling itself as the democratic power, in contrast to China, that has best handled the crisis. Its national press is full of articles on how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/germanys-devolved-logic-is-helping-it-win-the-coronavirus-race\">Germany is following</a> the South Korean model of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/covid-19-south-koreans-keep-calm-and-carry-on-testing\">mass testing</a>.</p> \n<p>But South Korea, an export-oriented economy, also faces long-term difficulties if the pandemic forces the west, as Prof Joseph Stiglitz predicts, into a total reassessment of the global supply chain. He argues the pandemic has revealed the drawbacks of concentrating production of medical supplies. As a result, just-in-time imports will go down and production of domestically sourced goods will go up. South Korea may gain kudos, but lose markets.</p> \n<p>The loser at the moment, apart from those like Steve Bannon who argued for \u201cthe deconstruction of the administrative state\u201d, risks being the EU.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/comparison\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Some of Europe\u2019s most scathing critics have been the pro-Europeans. Nicole Gnesotto, the vice-president of the Jacques Delors Institute thinktank, says: \u201cThe EU\u2019s lack of preparations, its powerlessness, its timidity are staggering. Of course, health is not part of its competency, but it is not without means or responsibility.\u201d The first instinct was to close borders, hoard equipment and assemble national responses. In times of scarcity it emerged every person was for themself, and Italy felt most left to itself.</p> \n<p>But the dispute has widened into an ugly battle between north and south Europe over the isssuance of common debt, or the conditions that could be set for any credit issued by the eurozone bailout fund. The Dutch and Germans suspect Italy is using the crisis in Lombardy to rebrand the rejected concept of eurobonds in which the north finances the debts of the feckless south. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, is pushing the issue, telling the bloc \u201cit has an appointment with history\u201d. If the EU fails, it could fall apart, he has warned.</p> \n<p>The Portuguese prime minister, Ant\u00f3nio Costa, spoke of \u201cdisgusting\u201d and \u201cpetty\u201d comments by the Dutch minister Wopke Hoekstra, while the Spanish foreign minister, Arancha Gonz\u00e1lez, wondered whether the Dutch understood that \u201ca first-class cabin would not protect you when the whole ship sinks\u201d.</p> \n<p>The former Italian prime minister Enrico Letta has been scathing about Dutch resistance to helping Italy, telling the Dutch press that the Italian view of the Netherlands has been seriously damaged: \u201cIt did not help that a day after German customs officials stopped a huge amount of masks at the border, Russian trucks carrying relief supplies drove through the streets of Rome and millions of masks were sent from China. Matteo Salvini is waiting for this type of action from the Netherlands and Germany so that he can say: you see, we have no use for the European Union.\u201d</p> \n<p>The EU\u2019s position is not irretrievable. Salvini\u2019s closure agenda has not yet found its footing, since Conte\u2019s popularity does not make the prime minister an easy target. Conte has become the single most popular leader in the history of the Italian republic. Individual German politicians, such as Marian Wendt, have also undone some of the damage by organising for a group of Italians to be flown from Bergamo to Cologne for treatment.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ddc0540c2d3df43693a70c493fd0e48ecd6e5fc1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ddc0540c2d3df43693a70c493fd0e48ecd6e5fc1/0_300_4347_2610/1000..jpg\" alt=\"A person in protective gear stands at the balcony of a Vatican building on Via della Conciliazione in Rome\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Italy has often felt alone within the EU in its battle against coronavirus.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Filippo Monteforte/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But with the death toll mounting across Europe, and the crisis just starting to penetrate Africa, the EU discourse so far has been dominated by an unedifying and highly technical row about how to fund the EU\u2019s economic rescue.</p> \n<p>Europe\u2019s chief solace is to look across the Atlantic and watch the daily chaos that is Donald Trump\u2019s evening press conference \u2013 the daily reminder that rational people can plan for anything, except an irrational president. Nathalie Tocci, an adviser to Josep Borrell, the EU foreign affairs chief, wonders whether, much like the 1956 Suez crisis symbolised the ultimate decay of the UK\u2019s global power, coronavirus could mark the \u201cSuez moment\u201d for the US.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Borrell himself insists the EU is finding its feet after a rocky start and the case for cooperation is being won. Writing <a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/global-priorities-covid19-response-by-josep-borrell-2020-03\">in Project Syndicate</a>, he claims: \u201cAfter a first phase of diverging national decisions, we are now entering a phase of convergence in which the EU takes centre stage. The world initially met the crisis in an uncoordinated fashion, with too many countries ignoring the warning signs and going it alone. It is now clear that the only way out of it is together.\u201d</p> \n<p>He may be proved right, but at the moment the scales are evenly balanced. There is, as yet, a world still to be won.</p>",

its lockdown until May 3, two trade union sources told Reuters on Thursday after meeting ministers. </p> \n  <p>* British Prime Minister Boris Johnson left intensive care on Thursday evening as he

found its scientific advisers were too slow to communicate their growing concerns.</p> \n  <p>* Britain urged its citizens to stay at home over the coming Easter holidays, amid fears that the pull of wanting to see family and friends over the Christian festival could undermine efforts to stop the virus spread. </p> \n  <p>* Social distancing measures have helped Germany to slightly slow the spread of the coronavirus, Chancellor Angela Merkel said. </p> \n  <p>* The number of confirmed infections in Germany rose by 5,323 in the past 24 hours to 113,525 on Friday, climbing for a fourth straight day, data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases showed. </p> \n  <p>* Russia reported a record one-day rise in cases, pushing its tally to more than 10,000.</p> \n  <p>* The Czech

Donald Trump has attempted to blame the WHO for the pandemic, pointing to a WHO tweet on 14 January saying \u201cthere was no human-to-human transmission\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>China reported

Daegu, which endured the first large coronavirus outbreak outside of China, on Friday reported zero new cases for the first time since late February, as new infections across the country dropped to record lows.</li> \n   <li><strong> </strong><strong>Boris Johnson was moved out of intensive care.</strong> A spokesperson said: \u201cThe prime minister has been moved this evening from intensive care back to the ward, where he will receive close monitoring during the early phase of his recovery.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>16.8 million Americans lost their jobs in the last three weeks</strong> as the coronavirus pandemic brings the US economy to a standstill. 6.6 million of those jobs were lost in the last week alone.</li> \n   <li><strong>Pope Francis presided at a scaled-down Holy Thursday mass in an empty St Peter\u2019s Basilica. </strong>He spoke from a secondary altar behind the main one he normally uses and the occasion was attended by only two dozen people, including a few aides, nuns and a scaled-down choir.</li> \n   <li><strong>Bang</strong><strong>ladesh imposed a \u201ccomplete lockdown\u201d in its Cox\u2019s Bazaar district,</strong> which

From the letter:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>\u201cLaunch a nationwide public service campaign to educate consumers about common scams targeting the economically vulnerable. Over the next several weeks, most consumers will receive checks of $1,200 or more because of the recently enacted Cares Act.

The weekend long curfew, the first of its kind within the United States geographical borders, will be enforced by tribal police, who have been authorized to sanction violators with a fine of up to $1000 and/or 30 days in jail. Essential workers such as medical staff are exempt, but must carry a letter from their employer. </p> \n  <p>On Thursday, Navajo president <strong>Jonathan Nez</strong> and vice-president <strong>Myron Lizer</strong>, announced that they were going into self-quarantine after recently coming into contact with a first responder who later tested positive for the virus. \u201cThis is real and no-one is immune from contracting the virus. We will continue to fight for our people as we self-quarantine - this is a precautionary measure,\u201d said Nez during an online town hall meeting. </p> \n  <p>The Navajo government was quick to implement prevention and mitigation measures after reporting its first case on 17 March, in an effort to minimize spread through its vast territory which stretches over parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. This included issuing a stay at home order just two days after California, followed by an 8pm to 5am curfew. But, the virus is spreading rapidly with 558 confirmed cases including 20 deaths as of Thursday 9 April. </p> \n  <p>Last month, the US federal government approved $8bn for native communities and tribal services in its third coronavirus rescue package, but tribal leaders fear that they won\u2019t see the money until summer due to red tape and paperwork.
