Tran, 40, and McBeath-Riley, 52, were found alive after 12 and 14 days in the desert, but Hockridge, 46, who had become separated, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/04/police-locate-body-near-alice-springs-believed-to-be-that-of-missing-woman-claire-hockridge\">died on December 4</a>.</p> <p>It was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/02/search-resumes-for-missing-pair-near-alice-springs-after-woman-found-alive\">initially reported as a camping trip gone awry</a>, and a miraculous rescue from the remote outback. But a police investigation, prepared for the Northern Territory coroner, has found that Hockridge, McBeath-Riley, and Tran had ventured into the bush in a drug smuggling operation that went wrong, looking to find methamphetamine they had hidden.</p> <p>Born on 1 May 1973 in Narrogin in Western Australia, Hockridge was one of five siblings, and one of three triplets. She was raised on farms in the WA wheat belt, had a degree in nursing, and moved to Alice Springs in 2005.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f039653b142006f15a139d50811b6850ef2c286\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f039653b142006f15a139d50811b6850ef2c286/0_43_940_564/500.jpg\" alt=\"three faces\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tamra McBeath-Riley (left), Phu Tran and Claire Hockridge told friends and family they \u2018planned to go driving or camping out of town\u2019, before they left to collect drugs they had buried off the Stuart Highway.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Northern Territory Police</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her sisters Sarah and Melinda came to Alice Springs when she went missing, and through the grief, thanked the police, farmers and emergency services who helped find their sister, and rescued her friends. Claire also had two children, born in 1992 and 1997.</p> <p>According to the report given to the coroner, Hockridge and McBeath-Riley used methamphetamine and heroin. In late October 2019, they drove to Adelaide with a plan to obtain methamphetamine and bring it back to Alice Springs. In Adelaide, they met their friend Tran, bought a second car, bought the drugs, and journeyed back.</p> <p>After they passed the Northern Territory border, and were 130km south of home, they turned and followed a dirt track to Highbury Station, a huge cattle station off the Stuart Highway.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At sunrise on November 20, Hockridge, McBeath-Riley and Tran found themselves in the dry river bed, the car bogged down in sand</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There, they dug holes and buried the drugs inside PVC canisters. They marked the place with arrows, drawn in the dirt, and left for Alice Springs. Five days later, on November 19 they told friends they \u201cplanned to go driving or camping out of town\u201d and made preparations for their return.</p> <p>Thinking it would be a short trip, the trio were woefully underprepared for what would be two weeks of 40C heat.</p> <p>According to the report, they left Alice Springs at 7.50pm that night, carrying 2-4 litres of water, a 20-litre Jerry can of fuel, a GPS, a compass, lighters, shovels, binoculars, a spotting scope, a case \u201ccontaining drug paraphernalia\u201d and half a pack of biscuits and one pack of beef instant noodles. They also had stopped earlier at a Liquorland and bought pre-mix vodka in cans.</p> <p>They found the drugs easily enough, dug them up and struck out back home, heading east, looking for the out-of-the-way Maryvale Road, so they could return to Alice Springs undetected. It was here they became lost.</p> <p>At sunrise on November 20, Hockridge, McBeath-Riley and Tran found themselves in the dry river bed, roughly 23km east of the Stuart Highway. The car was bogged down in sand.</p> <p>They tried to free the car but couldn\u2019t. They stayed inside with the air-conditioner on, drank through all the water as well as eight cans of the vodka mix. At 9pm the next day, they walked north for a kilometre until they found a waterhole, filled their bottles and drank \u2013&nbsp;perhaps not realising the water was stagnant. They continued like this for the next few days. In the day, they dug themselves under the car to escape the heat, and a night, they slept inside the car. All three become violently ill from the water.</p> <p>By November 23, their friends had become concerned, and Hockridge\u2019s daughter reported her missing. On November 24, the car ran out of fuel. They abandoned it, walked north and set up camp by a different waterhole, where they began boiling the water before drinking.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in Alice Springs, police had searched Hockridge and McBeath-Riley\u2019s apartment. They found it had been trashed, and \u201cit appeared as though someone else had already been through the unit\u201d. A CCTV recording box nearby had been unplugged. It is still unclear who was responsible for this.</p> <p>As police searched, on November 28, the trio decided that Hockridge and Tran would leave camp and walk to look for help on the Stuart Highway. Their GPS said it was a 23km walk. McBeath-Riley would stay at the waterhole with her dog, a blue staffordshire terrier.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b4f3e1a2af5fe739d7fabb1253dd0c3e1b933758\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4f3e1a2af5fe739d7fabb1253dd0c3e1b933758/0_0_940_564/500.jpg\" alt=\"four concrete pipes in the desert\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Phu Tran sheltered in concrete pipes at night and said the discovery of a water tank at Palmer Valley station saved him.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ABC News: Hamish Harty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hockridge and Tran left in the late afternoon, each with a bag and 3 litres of water each, and walked until night.

Tran went to find some shade, and passed out. When he woke up, he could not see Hockridge.</p> <p>On November 27, police received a tip-off about where the trio had buried the drugs. Helicopters began searching the area. Tran had found a water tank at Palmer Valley Station that he said saved him. On November 29, the station manager of Henbury Station spotted the car\u2019s tyre tracks, and police found the car from the air two days later.</p> <p>McBeath-Riley and her dog Raya were found alive at the campsite nearby. Police found the footprints of Tran and Hockridge, which showed they were \u201cconfused and disoriented\u201d. Hockridge was carrying two packages of methamphetamine, weighing 100g, and seven and a half grams of heroin. The group had used between 22-33 grams of the methamphetamine.</p> <p>On December 3, Tran was discovered at the water tank by the owner of Palmer Valley Station, a man called Ted Fogarty. The next day, police found Hockridge\u2019s body, 8.5km east of the Stuart Highway.</p> <p>Days earlier, from Alice Springs hospital, McBeath-Riley had said she was \u201cworried to death\u201d about her partner, after finding out she had not made it to the main road. Claire\u2019s sister Sarah, with Melinda, spoke to media after the ordeal was over.</p> <p>\u201cEven though Claire died in terrible circumstances, we are glad that Tamra and Phu have been found alive and well,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are extremely grateful to everyone who was involved in that.</p> <p>\u201cMy brothers, Melinda and I extend our gratitude to the Northern Territory police for their skilful investigation that allowed the search area to be focused correctly. We are really grateful to everyone who has supported us over what has been a truly agonising time.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>In Ford v Ferrari \u2013 the Oscar-nominated film that tells the story of Le Mans 1966 \u2013 there\u2019s a memorable scene where driver Ken Miles looks out over a racing circuit at dusk. \u201cOut there is the perfect lap,\u201d Miles tells his young son. \u201cNo mistakes, every gear change, every corner, perfect. Can you see it?\u201d \u201cI think so,\u201d his son replies. \u201cMost people can\u2019t,\u201d says Miles.</p> <p>During this sporting hiatus I\u2019ve been pondering perfection, and the discipline it takes to achieve it, born of the sense that everyone around the world is using their Covid-enforced break more productively than me. I picture writers hunched over laptops, artists at easels, chefs in kitchens, all finalising the masterpieces that will enrich our worlds on their return. Meanwhile in backyards and garages, ranks of mini-Messis and Serenas and Steve Smiths clock up their 10,000 hours, while I perfect the length of my afternoon nap.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/01/thank-you-ben-stokes-for-another-headingley-miracle\">Thank you, Ben Stokes, for another Headingley miracle | Emma John</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Blessed with unexpected time to fill, which could be devoted to the minute daily improvement of any skill I chose, I have found my mind more scattered and distractable than ever. I\u2019ve felt overwhelmed, and decided to pursue something more realistic, namely the rewatching of every Marvel movie in chronological order.</p> <p>We know that high achievers and sports stars are made of different stuff from the rest of us \u2013 it\u2019s why we put them on pedestals. And yet a lifetime of interviewing them has impressed on me how very normal most are, how ordinary their daily routines, how relatable their struggles. True, they are far better at self-discipline \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t always come naturally to them. Yes, they have perfection in their sights \u2013 but they have to learn how to stop it paralysing them, too.</p> <p>Whatever the marker \u2013 Federer\u2019s forehand, Tiger\u2019s tee-shot, or Simone Biles\u2019s beam dismount \u2013 the pursuit of perfection is always a paradox. The more you desire it, the more dangerous its lure. In golf, the difference between winning and losing can be a matter of millimetres. Propelling a ball hundreds of yards into a four-and-a-quarter-inch hole is a process built on biomechanical precision \u2013 and yet, in the context of gameplay, it\u2019s bested by psychology. Why else do players suffer dramatic collapses when they\u2019re top of the leaderboard?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The pursuit of perfection is a paradox; the more you desire it, the more dangerous its lure</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is where sports science is making its biggest advances. In the 1990s, the quest for perfection focused on fitness training: footballers who once viewed the ice bath as somewhere to keep the beers cold were now expected to use it to deal with excess lactic acid. The new millennium brought us big data \u2013 a wave of analytics that could illuminate the tiniest of weaknesses. In 2020, sport faces its final frontier \u2013 the mind.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the one element which you\u2019ve never been able to measure,\u201d says Jeremy Snape, the former England cricketer whose company, Sporting Edge, provides psychological-based consultancy to high-performance athletes and business organisations. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t measure the fact that when I walked out to bowl to Sachin Tendulkar my belief in my ability was 32% but Darren Gough\u2019s was 98%. But these human challenges \u2013 courage, adaptability, instinctive decision-making under pressure \u2013 are fundamental.\u201d</p> <p>As professional sport becomes ever bigger business, the pressure on its participants increases exponentially. Sport follows a binary narrative \u2013 creating heroes or villains \u2013 and the result can be paralysing. \u201cOur brains are built for survival,\u201d says Snape, \u201cso often our primitive instinct is to protect our self-esteem rather than take a risk and go for glory.\u201d</p> <p>In other words, set yourself the goal of perfection and you\u2019ll worry more about the consequences of falling short. \u201cPerfectionism can be good for driving your work ethic and your attention to detail. But it can also cause stress, procrastination and even avoidance \u2013 because you\u2019re afraid of not achieving it. The really great sportspeople have the courage to throw themselves into any endeavour with 100% commitment, knowing that it\u2019s going to be imperfect.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/dec/22/roger-federer-tennis-muhammad-ali\">Faultless Roger Federer\u2019s appeal transcends tennis to become an icon | Kevin Mitchell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There was no better example last year than Ben Stokes.

Dweck argues that it is limiting to see talent as a fixed, innate \u201cgift\u201d, something you have or you don\u2019t, because such thinking encourages people to show competence in areas where they\u2019ve already demonstrated it.</p> <p>Instead, Dweck outlines a \u201cgrowth mindset\u201d which asserts that each of us is learning incrementally every day, becoming wiser and more skilled as a result of both our successes and failures. Its exponents tend to meet uncertainty and new challenges with more courage \u2013 because they are not looking to protect their pride.</p> <p>The message resonates in all walks of life. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re pitching business sales or playing an international rugby match, you have to believe that you\u2019ve got the ability to learn quickly,\u201d says Snape. That, he says, is the new competitive advantage.</p> <p>When we emerge from lockdown, of course, all of us will be adapting to a new world. Maybe something we can learn from sport, in our new environment, is not to feel overcome by the magnitude of the challenges ahead of us but to throw ourselves into them with less fear of failure. Or maybe it\u2019s a simple reminder to stop framing sportspeople as heroes and antiheroes. After all, if I want wonder-women and super villains, I\u2019ve got Marvel.</p>",

Russia has the third highest reported total of cases in the world after the United States and Brazil.</p> <h2><strong>Iran sees highest tally of new infections since early April</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/29/coronavirus-covid-19-live-news-global-deaths-uk-eases-lockdown-updates?page=with:block-5ed0ef368f084df971c8bf07#block-5ed0ef368f084df971c8bf07\">Iran&nbsp;identifies more new cases in a day than at any time since early April</a>, with 2,819 more people testing positive on Friday.</p> <p>Kianoush Jahanpour, the Iranian health ministry spokesman, adds that 50 more people have died in the same period, pushing the total death toll from the outbreak to 7,677. Out of 146,668 cases detected so far, 114,931 people have recovered.</p> <h2><strong>South Africa has backlog of nearly 100,000 tests</strong></h2> <p>Health authorities in&nbsp;South Africa&nbsp;say <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/29/coronavirus-covid-19-live-news-global-deaths-uk-eases-lockdown-updates?page=with:block-5ed104498f087122eca51d73#block-5ed104498f087122eca51d73\">the country has a backlog of nearly 100,000 unprocessed tests</a> as it and other countries on the continent face difficulties in obtaining essential supplies.</p> <p>\u201cThis challenge is caused by the limited availability of test kits globally,\u201d the health ministry says. Priority is given to processing tests from hospital patients and health workers.</p> <h2><strong>South Korea reimposes some lockdown measures</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/29/coronavirus-covid-19-live-news-global-deaths-uk-eases-lockdown-updates?page=with:block-5ed112678f087122eca51e3a#block-5ed112678f087122eca51e3a\">Plans to reopen more than 800 schools in South Korea are shelved</a> as the country battles a renewed outbreak. The country\u2019s easing of lockdown measures goes into reverse, with museums, parks and art galleries closed again on Friday for two weeks amid a resurgence in infections. It was originally reported only 200 of the schools due to reopen would remain closed.</p> <h2><strong>Sweden left out of Nordic border reopenings</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/29/coronavirus-covid-19-live-news-global-deaths-uk-eases-lockdown-updates?page=with:block-5ed116c48f087122eca51e92#block-5ed116c48f087122eca51e92\">A Nordic rift opens up over proposals to ease restrictions</a>, with&nbsp;Sweden&nbsp;excluded from Norwegian and Danish plans to reopen their borders to tourists from some countries next month. The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, and the Norwegian prime minister, Erna Solberg, say most restrictions will end on 15 June.</p> <h2><strong>UK, France, Spain and Italy excluded from Greece border reopening</strong></h2> <p>Greece&nbsp;is to reopen its airports in Athens and Thessaloniki to arrivals from 29 countries from 15 June, the start of the tourist season.

  "<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/south-korea\">South Korea</a>&nbsp;</strong>has postponed the planned reopening of more than 800 schools as it battles a renewed outbreak of the coronavirus, with cases now at their highest level for almost two months.</p> <p>The country\u2019s easing of lockdown measures has gone into reverse, with museums, parks and art galleries closed again on Friday for two weeks. Kindergarten pupils, and some primary and secondary school students were due back from Wednesday, in the last phase of school reopenings.</p> <p>According to the education ministry, however, 838 schools out of 20,902 nationwide remain shut. They are located in areas hard hit by the latest wave of infections, including the capital, Seoul, and the cities of Bucheon and Gumi.</p> <p>South Korea has been praised for its deft handling of the Covid crisis. It seemed to have brought the virus under control only to record 79 new cases this week, the highest daily figure for two months. The government has responded by bringing back lockdown measures in the Seoul metropolitan area, home to half of the country\u2019s 51 million population.</p> <p>Most of these cases have been linked to a distribution centre in Bucheon. The warehouse is run by the country\u2019s biggest e-commerce firm Coupang. Health officials traced at least 82 infections to the facility, with the virus found on workers\u2019 shoes and clothes. They are now testing all employees and visitors.</p> <p>In the <strong>Philippines</strong>, meanwhile, plans were unveiled on Friday to ease strict lockdown measures despite a record spike in new cases. The country reported 539 infections on Thursday, bringing its total to 15,588, with 921 deaths.</p> <p>From Monday the capital, Manila, will allow gatherings of up to 10 people and free movement in and out of the city as long as travellers wear masks and keep their distance. Workplaces, shops and some public transport will reopen. Manila is home to 12 million people and is the centre of the nation\u2019s outbreak and efforts to battle the contagion.</p> <p>\u201cFor me, this does not look bad,\u201d President Rodrigo Duterte said in a televised address. He described the country\u2019s mortality rate as low and called for a move to the \u201cnew normal\u201d. Health minister, Francisco Duque, said 90% of the country\u2019s Covid-19 cases were \u201cmild\u201d.</p> <p>Manila\u2019s lockdown will this weekend surpass the 76-day quarantine of Wuhan, the city in <strong>China </strong>where the first outbreak of the coronavirus was detected. Manila\u2019s restrictions have hit the livelihoods of millions of workers and there is pressure to ease damage to an economy that is facing its deepest contraction in 34 years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4be97355e91b379bb28b614be675fc47063390a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4be97355e91b379bb28b614be675fc47063390a7/0_108_2250_1350/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manila police trainees maintain social distancing on a train during an exercise in preparation for the resumption of public transport\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manila police trainees maintain social distancing on a train during an exercise in preparation for the resumption of public transport</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eloisa Lopez/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Globally, deaths stand at nearly 360,000, with 5.8 million cases. Asia is struggling to cement early success in controlling outbreaks of coronavirus.</p> <p>In <strong>India</strong>, Mumbai\u2019s hospitals are on the verge of collapse, with footage emerging of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/29/india-mumbai-hospitals-overwhelmed-coronavirus-cases\">patients sharing beds and oxygen tanks</a>. \u201cThe volume and density of our population in Mumbai makes it very difficult to see how we will get out of the other side of this peak,\u201d said Manish Shetty, a doctor on the Covid-19 ward in Guru Nanak hospital in Mumbai. \u201cThe magnitude of the cases is overwhelming us all.\u201d</p> <p>Weeks earlier, footage emerged of patients being treated next to dead bodies, lying unclaimed by families fearful of infection.</p> <p>Meanwhile in <strong>Sri Lanka</strong>, some lockdown rules will be rolled out again from Sunday after more than 250 returnees from Kuwait were found to be infected with coronavirus.</p> <p>In <strong>Japan</strong>, a cluster response team has been sent to the south-western city of Kitakyushu, which has seen a sudden rise in cases after three weeks with no new infections. The city has clocked up 43 cases this week, bringing its total to 119. How more than a dozen of the latest infections came about remains unclear.</p> <p>The mayor, Kenji Kitahashi, warned of a second virus wave and asked residents to refrain from non-essential outings. \u201cIf we leave this as it is, we will definitely be hit by a large second wave,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Several Middle Eastern countries eased restrictions on Friday. In Saudi Arabia a three-day transition to relative normality got under way, with malls and waterfronts open and the Kingdom readying to allow up to 90,000 mosques to receive worshippers on Sunday for the first time in nearly two months.</p> <p>In the United Arab Emirates, Dubai\u2019s beaches and parks reopened. The city\u2019s museums are expected to reopen their doors on Monday, as officials try to position the country as \u2018open for business\u2019 after the most crippling economic slowdown in the country\u2019s history.</p> <p>Both the Emirates and Saudi Arabia have been among the regional states most affected by Covid-19, with the virus taking an unprecedented toll on state revenues and forcing seismic shake-ups in labour markets and other key sectors.</p> <p>Balancing dwindling revenues and consumer confidence against a public health emergency has been particularly challenging for the UAE, one of the globe\u2019s main aviation hubs and an emerging tourist destination, the viability of which depends heavily on a pre-Covid interconnected world resuming on a similar scale.</p> <p>Both countries have enforced social distancing and have imposed curfews throughout the crisis. Numbers have increased steadily throughout the pandemic, with more than 32,500 cases registered in the UAE and more than 80,000 in Saudi Arabia. Migrant workforces account for large numbers of cases in each state. The ratio of deaths to contractions in each state is lower than the global average, at less than one per cent.</p> <p>In other global developments:</p> <ul> <li><p>Health officials in <strong>Moscow</strong> updated their figures on coronavirus deaths<strong>.</strong>&nbsp;On top of 636 deaths in April reported earlier, the health department added the deaths of 756 people who tested positive for the virus but died of other causes.</p></li> <li><p>In&nbsp;<strong>France</strong>, the prime minister said a ban on journeys of more than 100km (62 miles) would end on Tuesday, adding that cafes, bars and restaurants in so-called green areas \u2013 where the virus is not circulating widely \u2013 would be able to reopen on the same date. In orange areas, such as Paris, establishments would be able to reopen only their outside terraces.</p></li> <li><p>Spain approved a minimum basic income scheme to help those on low incomes. The \u20ac3bn scheme will provide monthly payments of between \u20ac462 and \u20ac1,015 to around 850,000 households, It will begin on 15 June.</p></li> <li><p>Health authorities in&nbsp;<strong>South Africa</strong>&nbsp;say the country has a backlog of nearly 100,000 unprocessed coronavirus tests, because of a difficulty in obtaining essential supplies.\u201cThis challenge is caused by the limited availability of test kits globally,\u201d the health ministry said.</p></li> <li><p>The president of Namibia, Hage Geingob, and several top officials have been fined after breaching regulations last month by hosting a celebration to mark his party\u2019s 60th anniversary.&nbsp;The South West&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa\">Africa</a>&nbsp;People\u2019s Organisation (Swapo) birthday party took place in parliament on 19 April, when Namibia was under lockdown and group gatherings banned.

I\u2019d never been in one that big \u2013 21,500 on that ground, which was absolutely fantastic. United had about 5,000 and we made up the rest. When Workington came out the crescendo was overwhelming and then we scored \u2013 it was almost like deadly silence and then all of a sudden it changed. The shock had been scoring after six minutes against the champions of England.</p> <p>\u201cWe had only signed Clive Colbridge in September from York City \u2013 he was a left-winger, tricky, quick. For his goal, Harry Gregg came out and a Billy Robson shot was blocked by Gregg\u2019s leg, the ball went to Colbridge on the edge of the area and he hurled it into a vacant net. Of course he became a hero after that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"837ee83110fa4859e5cef3e04d1f5f80d1e4cee9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/837ee83110fa4859e5cef3e04d1f5f80d1e4cee9/0_116_2013_1208/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The matchday programme from an FA Cup tie that, at one stage, appeared set to become one of the greatest shocks in the competition\u2019s history\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The matchday programme from an FA Cup tie that, at one stage, appeared set to become one of the greatest shocks in the competition\u2019s history.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leslie Millman collection</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Colbridge had been signed by Joe Harvey, though some players remained from an 85-match Bill Shankly tenure three years before. \u201cNorman Mitchell, the right-winger, Bobby Brown, a right-back, Alex Rollo, and Matthew Newlands, the goalkeeper, were his,\u201d Walsh says of Shankly, who sent best wishes to Workington on the tie\u2019s eve.</p> <p>Harvey\u2019s full XI was a 2-3-5 that read: Newlands; Brown, Rollo; Jack Bertolini, George Aitken, Burkinshaw; Mitchell, Robson, Ted Purdon, Ken Chisholm, Colbridge. \u201cThe first half, Workington were the better side,\u201d Walsh remembers. \u201cI think Bobby Charlton has said as much in subsequent interviews. We were unlucky not to be at least two goals ahead.\u201d</p> <p>Burkinshaw was a wing-half, then a wide-midfield position. \u201cI was playing against Charlton,\u201d he says. \u201cUnited were a very big [successful] side in those days, and, of course, it was an FA Cup game. It didn\u2019t worry me at all. I was 22 and at that age you\u2019re not worried about anybody, really. You\u2019ve always got that belief in yourself and in the team.\u201d</p> <p>Workington had shocked United in the first half and the opposition manager was not best pleased. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it at the time but was told that Busby was absolutely raging at half-time,\u201d says Walsh. \u201cHe left the director\u2019s box to speak to his team.\u201d</p> <p>Busby\u2019s talk worked, though following the interval Workington walked out confident. \u201cWe were winning 1-0 and we thought we were in with a chance,\u201d Burkinshaw says. \u201cJoe Harvey wasn\u2019t afraid that we could have pulled off a shock because he\u2019d been captain of Newcastle when they were winning things. But in the second half they came back into it, and Dennis Viollet got three goals, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p> <p>He indeed did: on 54, 56, and 62 minutes. The dream was over but the occasion had lived up to its fevered anticipation. \u201cOnce the draw was made and you\u2019re playing against Man United there\u2019s only one topic of conversation,\u201d Walsh says. \u201cI was at grammar school and although it was rugby playing we had a crew of us who were football fanatics and there was plenty of conversation about the match. It was tremendous.\u201d </p> <p>Afterwards Burkinshaw travelled to Liverpool alongside Jimmy Murphy, Busby\u2019s assistant. \u201cI\u2019d got a girlfriend who became my wife and I was going back to Liverpool to see her. Jimmy was on the train and we went back down together,\u201d he says.</p> <p>That FA Cup tie lives on in Workington folklore and is given poignancy by the fact the Munich air tragedy occur only a month later, claiming 23 lives, including those of Edwards, Byrne, Taylor and Colman.</p> <p><em>For more information on the webcast </em><em>on Saturday</em><em>, including how to purchase tickets, click <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/workington-v-manchester-utd-recreating-the-famous-1958-fa-cup-game-tickets-102896173224\">here</a>.</em></p>",

  "<p>An hour into his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/8e8e5214-346d-4be8-adf7-addfc839ff6d\">hearing</a>&nbsp;in front of parliament\u2019s influential liaison committee on Wednesday, the prime minister is likely to have felt a moment of relief as the examination moved on from the scandals of recent days.</p> <p>Then, an earnest, urgent question from Stephen Timms, Labour MP for East Ham, brought Johnson\u2019s attention to the plight of a couple in Timms\u2019 constituency. The husband had lost his income during the Covid-19 crisis and the wife\u2019s income was less than their monthly rent. With \u201cNo recourse to public funds\u201d stamped on their visas, they were unable to access any support as they worked out how to make ends meet and provide for their two children (both born in the UK) and the threat of destitution hung over them.</p> <p>\u201cEr, hang on, Stephen,\u201d Johnson replied. \u201cWhy don\u2019t they, why aren\u2019t they eligible for universal credit or for employment support allowance?\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t even in the top five most reported takeaways from the hearing, but for many people, this moment (captured live on TV) was simply unbelievable. \u201cThey have no recourse to public funds,\u201d responded Timms, who then did his best to explain to the prime minister that though they paid taxes and abided by the same laws as everyone else, most people who move to Britain from elsewhere (and anyone without documented status) are explicitly prohibited for up to 10 years from seeking the protection of the social security safety net in a time of personal or national crisis.</p> <p>No recourse to public funds <a href=\"https://www.londoncouncils.gov.uk/our-key-themes/asylum-migration-and-refugees/no-recourse-public-funds\">(NRPF)</a> was introduced by New Labour in 1999. In 2012,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.unity-project.org.uk/suspend-nrpf\">Theresa May expanded</a> it&nbsp;to include even those who moved here to live with their British families. The policy has been debated and defended&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/Contributions?startDate=1998-05-28&amp;endDate=2020-05-28&amp;searchTerm=%22No%20Recourse%20to%20Public%20Funds%22&amp;partial=False\">more than 200 times</a>&nbsp;by both Labour and Conservative governments, and at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/Contributions?startDate=2019-07-24&amp;endDate=2020-05-28&amp;searchTerm=%22No%20Recourse%20to%20Public%20Funds%22&amp;partial=False\">least 80 times</a>&nbsp;since Johnson became prime minister. Timms and other MPs have repeatedly raised the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2020-04-28/debates/6B80ADC6-5AE0-404A-BF91-3924FAD111CE/PublicServices?highlight=%22no%20recourse%20to%20public%20funds%22#contribution-8DD0E99A-FED0-4CC0-929B-44F18E5D2B56\">risks</a>&nbsp;posed to families with NRPF, only to have their concerns brushed off by ministers. At the onset of the Covid-19 crisis, dozens of concerned organisations&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jcwi.org.uk/protecting-migrants-from-covid-19\">wrote to Priti Patel, the </a><a href=\"https://www.jcwi.org.uk/protecting-migrants-from-covid-19\">home </a><a href=\"https://www.jcwi.org.uk/protecting-migrants-from-covid-19\">secretary</a>, urging her to suspend the policy. We are yet to hear back from her. And, though the public may be forgiven for having never heard them, the very words \u201cno recourse to public funds\u201d are deeply, often painfully understood by&nbsp;anyone&nbsp;who has moved to the UK,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.childrenssociety.org.uk/sites/default/files/a-lifeline-for-all-summary.pdf\">including at least 100,000 children</a>.</p> <p>When the usually verbose prime minister can\u2019t find words to defend something, you can safely conclude that there are none. But the real kick in the chest, for anyone with NRPF who has worried about making ends meet in a crisis, will have come from learning that he didn\u2019t even know that the policy (or the people it affects) existed. That ministers and advisers hadn\u2019t thought it was important enough to tell the prime minister that people were contracting and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/equality-watchdog-urged-investigate-impact-on-bame-people-london-mayor\">dying of Covid-19</a>&nbsp;because they were forced to work by NRPF conditions or that an&nbsp;eight-year old British boy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/07/home-offices-denial-of-benefits-to-migrant-families-unlawful-court-rules\">needed to sue</a> the government&nbsp;to stop his family from starving during a pandemic. Or worse still, that perhaps they&nbsp;had&nbsp;told him and he just hadn\u2019t thought it was important enough to pay attention or remember.</p> <p>The ability to turn a blind eye, to enjoy the luxury of not knowing what your choices mean for the lives of others, is a recipe for bad government. And governments of both main parties have found it far too easy to turn the screws on migrants to satisfy the baying crowd before looking the other way. So what else does the prime minister not know about how his government treats migrants and our families?</p> <p>As the soon-to-be-married father of a newborn son, does the prime minister know that if you are a migrant married to a British national, you cannot live here with them&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jcwi.org.uk/news/protecting-families-at-risk-due-to-covid-19\">until they reach an income level</a>&nbsp;that\u2019s out of reach for 40% of workers in this country?

measures is also temporary, limited to the 2019-20 and 2020-21 financial years and is not baking material structural burdens into the budget bottom line beyond that period.</p> \n  <p>Nevertheless, the April monthly financial statements reflect both the impact of the current economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic on both revenue and payments as well as the fiscal impact of the additional economic support measures we have put in place since MYEFO 2019-20.</p> \n  <p><strong>Total payments to the end of April 2020 were $12bn higher than assumed in the 2019-20 MYEFO profile.</strong></p>

payment to pensioners, social security, veteran and other income support recipients and eligible concession card holders</p> \n  <p> \u00b7 National Medical Stockpile \u2013 Purchase of Masks, Other

sector to ensure viability and capacity during the Covid-19 response.</p> \n  <p>The impact of the pandemic on government revenue as a result of related economic parameter variations also remains significant, with receipts nearly $20bn lower than the 2019-20 MYEFO profile.</p> \n  <p>This is driven by below profile collections across both income and indirect taxes.</p> \n  <p><strong>The underlying cash balance for the financial year to 30 April 2020 is a deficit of $40bn instead of a deficit to that point of $7.6bn in the 2019-20 MYEFO profile.</strong></p> \n </div> \n <p

And beyond that, there\u2019s a broader contribution to public life on so many issues, which your program this morning is rehearsing all of those. </p> \n   <p>But can I recall one on behalf of the grateful members of the Southern Districts Rugby Club. Back in 2007, I was running for parliament and that year the then-New South Wales rugby union was trying to boot Southern Districts out of the premiership, together with Penrith and who are sadly \u2026 sorry, not Penrith, Illawarra and Penrith. And you stood up with us and, I mean, you came out to the club and you\u2019ve been to the club many times since then. </p> \n   <p>And Southern Districts has gone on from strength to strength since then and so I\u2019m sure all of them would want me to pass on to you, mate, our thanks for that. </p> \n   <p>But there are so many stories like that everyone can tell. Some were at a big national global scale, but some of them are just saving a great footy club. So, mate, thanks very much, and Jenny and I want to wish you all the best for your future.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T23:54:39.135Z\">at 12.54am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed04a398f084e882655ab54\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T23:33:40.184Z\">12.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The entire direction as sent out by the Victorian premier: <br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DanielAndrewsMP/status/1266147958963056640\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Update on directions on continuing to work from home <a href=\"https://t.co/3eHyh9j6dt\">pic.twitter.com/3eHyh9j6dt</a></p>\u2014 Dan Andrews (@DanielAndrewsMP) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DanielAndrewsMP/status/1266147958963056640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 28, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T23:54:58.199Z\">at 12.54am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed048f58f0898700351e39a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T23:32:51.461Z\">12.32am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Victorians ordered to continue working from home</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>If you have been working from home in Victoria, you have to continue working from home.

The international community has a significant and long-standing stake in Hong Kong\u2019s prosperity and stability. Direct imposition of national security legislation on Hong Kong by the Beijing authorities, rather than through Hong Kong\u2019s own institutions as provided for under Article 23 of the Basic Law, would curtail the Hong Kong people\u2019s liberties and, in doing so, dramatically erode Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy and the system that made it so prosperous. </p> \n   <p>China\u2019s decision to impose the new national security law on Hong Kong lies in direct conflict with its international obligations under the principles of the legally-binding, UN-registered Sino-British Joint Declaration. The proposed law would undermine the One Country, Two Systems framework. It also raises the prospect of prosecution in Hong Kong for political crimes, and undermines existing commitments to protect the rights of Hong Kong people \u2013 including those set out in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. </p> \n   <p><strong>We are also extremely concerned that this action will exacerbate the existing deep divisions in Hong Kong society; </strong>the law does nothing to build mutual understanding and foster reconciliation within Hong Kong. Rebuilding trust across Hong Kong society by allowing the people of Hong Kong to enjoy the rights and freedoms they were promised can be the only way back from the tensions and unrest that the territory has seen over the last year.</p> \n   <p><strong>The world\u2019s focus on a global pandemic requires enhanced trust in governments and international cooperation.

  "<p> There are some comedies that seem to have been rubbed all over with an anti-funny, anti-romance Kryptonite. This is one. It\u2019s the cinematic equivalent of elevator muzak \u2013 a festival of glam-smug with zero chemistry between any of its three leads. It\u2019s supposedly a comedy-drama, set in the LA music scene: Tracee Ellis Ross plays Grace Davis, a singing legend in middle age who is faced with the career death of a proposed Vegas residency, being forced on her by a cynical, money-mad manager (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/28/lockdown-watch-ice-cube-michael-jordan\">Ice Cube</a>). Dakota Johnson plays her demure assistant Maggie, a music superfan and vinyl connoisseur (cue: namedropping references to Joni Mitchell) and also a wannabe producer, who tries persuading Grace to record more new songs and stay true to her creativity.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvsMLwvFNgc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dvsMLwvFNgc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/28/lockdown-watch-ice-cube-michael-jordan\">Ice Cube: 'I listen to my own music more than I watch my own films'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Maggie also finds herself romantically drawn to a cocky but talented young singer called David (Kelvin Harrison Jr). The relationships \u2013&nbsp;between the women and the two young lovers \u2013&nbsp;are completely without life, and the whole film is bathed in Insta-video blandness.

Dakota Johnson\u2019s performance remains waxily unenthused as she goes through the motions of break-up/make-up with her mentor and her lover, and just when the film is coasting to its unearned emotional resolution, the script gives us an outrageously silly twist, which brings in a truly ghastly celebration of entitlement and unintentional ickiness. It\u2019s sad to see Harrison, who has shown himself a force to be reckoned with in earlier movies, get landed with this dull schlock.</p> <ul> <li><p>The High Note is available on digital platforms from 29 May.</p></li> </ul>",

  "<p>Nearly 2,000 immigration staff, including workers at the UK\u2019s ports and airports, were off sick with Covid-19 symptoms in the first four months of the year, with more than half absent before the lockdown was imposed, the Guardian can reveal.</p> \n<p>Between 1 January and 29 April there were 1,880 Border Force and UK Visas &amp; Immigration (UKVI) staff recorded as beginning a period of sickness absence due to Covid-19 symptoms, equal to 12% of the combined workforce for both agencies.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Of these, 516 Border Force and 529 UKVI workers were off before 23 March, a total of 1,045 or 7% of the combined workforce. The absences peaked in the week to 22 March, just before lockdown, for both agencies. Only five of the cases were recorded between 1 January and 1 March.</p> \n<p>Unions representing immigration staff reacted to the figures with anger and criticised the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) provided to workers.</p> \n<p>Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union, the biggest union representing Border Force staff, said: \u201cBorder Force management&nbsp;have at some airports actively told PCS members at passport&nbsp;control not to wear PPE because it gave the \u2018wrong impression\u2019 to travelling passengers.</p> \n<p>\u201cWell, the impression they&nbsp;have given is that they care&nbsp;more about image than the health and safety of Border Force staff. And these figures are a searing indictment of their approach.\u201d</p> \n<p>Lucy Moreton, of the Immigration Services Union, said: \u201cThe statistics clearly show the impact on staff prior to the lockdown and the immediate impact that had in limiting the spread of the virus amongst Border Force and UKVI staff.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cObtaining suitable PPE for staff, particularly staff at the border, is an ongoing struggle.&nbsp;Although sickness rates amongst border and immigration staff never reached the \u201ccritical\u201d 30% of absence which Home Office originally planned for, there is no excuse for the failures to protect key workers.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cStaff at the border see staff in supermarkets, delivery drivers etc \u2013 as much key workers as they themselves are \u2013 wearing masks, face shields [and encourage to adopt] social distancing measures.&nbsp;Yet they continue to attend work actively discouraged from complying with the government recommendations regarding face coverings and with masks issued as PPE only in very limited circumstances.\u201d</p> \n<p>The figures were provided to the Labour MP <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/stephen-doughty\">Stephen Doughty</a> in answer to a parliamentary question.</p> \n<p>There were 23.7m arrivals into the UK by air, land and sea in the first three months of the year, including 18.1m arrivals by air between 1 January and 23 March. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/patrick-vallance\">Sir Patrick Vallance</a>, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, told MPs there was \u201ca big influx\u201d of coronavirus cases from Italy and Spain in early March.</p> \n<p>Doughty, a former member of the home affairs select committee, told the Guardian: \u201cThis shocking revelation in answer to my question shows one of the likely impacts of failing to introduce proper measures to protect staff at the border when they were most needed \u2013 in the first quarter of the year \u2013 when over 23 million British and other travellers entered the UK without proper health checks or formal quarantine.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhile some of this illness will have undoubtedly been picked up outside of work, the fact Sir Patrick Vallance admitted that we had imported many, many cases, coupled with these figures, suggests that many frontline staff may have been exposed and infected in the course of their work.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe government must urgently publish the scientific advice it used, and an explanation for their failure to act when it could have made a difference.\u201d</p> \n<p>At least two Border Force staff have contracted Covid-19 and died.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Critics of the government\u2019s approach have questioned if more could have been done to screen arrivals earlier in the pandemic, particularly from hotspots, including Wuhan in China \u2013 the source of the Covid-19 outbreak \u2013 and northern Italy.</p> \n<p>Of the 18.1 million arrivals between 1 January and 23 March, only 273 passengers on three flights from Wuhan and one flight from Japan were formally quarantined in government-supported isolation facilities.</p> \n<p>The government stopped issuing guidance at the border to arrivals from specific countries \u2013 including from Italy and China \u2013 to self-isolate on 13 March, 10 days before the lockdown was imposed. Since then, there has been little intervention other than advice provided on leaflets and posters. There were more than 100,000 arrivals by air into the UK in April.</p> \n<p>Since then, the government has announced it is to enforce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/22/uk-arrivals-8-june-quarantine-for-14-days-coronavirus\">a 14-day period of self isolation for all arrivals into the UK</a> from 8 June, prompting many to question why such a policy was not implemented earlier in the crisis.</p> \n<p>The figures also show that in the first four months of the year, there were a further 2,345 Border Force and UKVI staff recorded as beginning a period of isolation at home either because a member of their household had Covid-19 symptoms or because the employee themselves was vulnerable to infection. Only five of the cases were recorded between 1 January and 1 March.</p> \n<p>Combined with those that had fallen ill themselves, this totals 27% of the workforce for Border Force and UKVI.</p> \n<p>The most recent Home Office annual report, published in June last year, showed there were 8,127 permanent employees at Border Force and 7,422 workers at UK Visas &amp; Immigration, a total of 15,549.</p> \n<p>The answers were provided by the minister for immigration compliance, Chris Philp. </p> \n<p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThe figures show Border Force and UKVI absences due to coronavirus are consistent with those across the UK at the time.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe safety of the public and our staff is of paramount importance, which is why Border Force staff have been provided with the necessary personal protective equipment. Protective screens have been installed in ports, and we are ensuring social distancing is maintained in passenger arrivals areas.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Three months ago, Indians were witnessing communal violence, Syrian children were freezing to death and locusts were terrorising Africa. Venezuelans craved reform, China was oppressing minorities and Kiribati was sinking. Although the pandemic has wiped these issues off the front page, we will still need to reckon with them one day.</p> <p>But at a time when mutual cooperation and problem-solving seems the only way forward, the world appears to be a confusing and partisan place where <a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/870368/65-worst-trump-tweets-2010s\">leaders take a special delight</a> in skewering their opponents with language and conduct that would be banned on a playground.</p> <p>When <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/China-up-close/Campaign-to-thank-Xi-Jinping-flatly-rejected-by-Wuhan-citizens\">fealty and praise</a> are valued above honesty and transparency, it\u2019s hard for optimism to flourish.</p> <p>Consequently, there is a real temptation for the average person to feel disempowered and hence disengaged from the issues facing broader society. Perhaps, if we can juggle endless Zoom meetings, avoid an argument at home and manage to cook something largely edible, it is enough. And maybe this is why I\u2019ve been reflecting on something that serves as a fitting antidote to my own inward-looking tendencies.</p> <p>Late February wasn\u2019t so long ago but now it seems like another era when the Great Hall of the Australian parliament hosted a gala event to recognise the recipients of this year\u2019s Fulbright awards.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.fulbright.org.au/\">Fulbright program</a> is the flagship foreign exchange scholarship program of the United States, aimed at increasing cultural understanding, collaboration and the exchange of ideas. It was established by <a href=\"https://www.cies.org/about-us/about-senator-j-william-fulbright\">Senator William Fulbright</a> in 1946 by using credits from the sale of surplus war material to fund academic exchanges between host nations and the US. In the past 70 years, 400,000 Fulbright recipients from around the world have attended the program.</p> <p>Being the fortunate recipient of a second Fulbright award to study public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School gave me much food for thought. Each year, several doctors receive a Fulbright and it\u2019s easy to see why. After all, infections, diabetes, heart disease and cancer are ubiquitous threats to population health. Also, we need an opioid policy that limits harm while doing good and societies must ponder how artificial intelligence engages with healthcare.</p> <p>But something I increasingly realise is that the status society accords to healthcare workers, especially frontline clinicians, can trick us into thinking that only health is wealth. Time spent with the sick and needy patients makes us rightly passionate about healthcare but of course, a civil society requires far, far more: good infrastructure, sound education, affordable housing, a clean environment, human rights, and able government to name but a few.</p> <p>Consequently, my favourite part of a Fulbright event is meeting those who consider issues that I frankly know very little about. How do we defend our water assets? What will make solar energy more efficient? How do we nurture artists and musicians in a world obsessed with immediate outcomes? What minerals will help the transition to green energy? How do fish and grasshoppers affect our ecosystem? What afflicts our cotton and wheat? How do we tackle modern slavery, sports integrity and addictive gaming? How can we improve education? Why does space research matter? These are just some of the questions this year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.fulbright.org.au/current-scholars/\">Fulbright scholars</a> are asking on behalf of society.</p> <p>As someone whose thinking as a doctor and a global citizen has been transformed by Senator Fulbright\u2019s vision, I am often asked two questions.</p> <h2><strong>What does it take to win a Fulbright award?</strong></h2> <p>A good education, not to be confused with an elite upbringing. Most scholars neither attend prestigious institutions nor have \u201cconnected\u201d families; indeed, many hail from small towns with scarce opportunities and even less patience for the problems of the world. But the common thread is they found one person who fired their imagination and challenged them to think differently. A sound early education opens doors by prompting broad curiosity, individual persistence and interdisciplinary collaboration. Incidentally, educated parents are writ large in the lives of Fulbright scholars. It was impossible for my Indian parents to entertain such an undertaking for themselves, but their education imbued them with a deep enthusiasm for learning.</p> <p>A rising tide lifts all boats, which is why an <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/six-ways-australias-education-system-is-failing-our-kids-32958\">excellent educational system</a> is the foundation of a successful society and why we should demand early learning, pay teachers well, support higher education and applaud researchers. </p> <p>In order to flourish, we all need someone who asks why not, instead of what for.</p> <h2><strong>What are Fulbright scholars like?</strong></h2> <p>They are ordinary people from all walks of life with one important attribute \u2013 they think deeply about an idea and are unafraid to take a measured risk in pursuit of a goal. Scholars spend years crystallising their thoughts and honing their case. There is no age limit and the oldest scholars have decades over the youngest. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/18/tampa-refugee-taken-in-by-new-zealand-wins-fulbright-scholarship\">Tampa refugee taken in by New Zealand wins Fulbright scholarship</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Being bold enough to champion an idea yet humble enough to recognise one\u2019s limitations matters. Vision is important. But most important is grit and the ability to persevere in the face of rejection, something everyone eventually encounters. A society thrives not just by producing scholars but by equipping all its citizens to discover their potential. Again, this is the real power of a good education.</p> <p>The final address to this year\u2019s Fulbright scholars came from <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/austory/a-place-for-us/9169912\">Sara James</a>, an Emmy award-winning American journalist and author who barely alluded to her considerable personal accomplishments. But you could hear a pin drop when she evoked the experience of raising a child with a disability and the inevitable collision of personal ambition with parental responsibility and societal advocacy. Delivered with grace and humility, her words were an unforgettable reminder that in life, reward and responsibility are frequently intertwined and it is up to us to take some and give back substantially more. </p> <p>Senator Fulbright memorably called his namesake program not a panacea but an avenue of hope that would give us \u201cthe ability to see the world as others see it and to allow for the possibility that others may see something we have failed to see, or may see it more accurately.\u201d Never have his words sounded more prophetic.</p> <p>You may be the next Fulbright scholar, or indeed, the reason someone decides to apply. Either way, <a href=\"https://www.fulbright.org.au/applicants/\">applications</a> are now open to find another group of curious thinkers.

It is hard to imagine a literary trail that would lead to many existing buildings around Australia. There are a number of conflicting claims about the birthplace of poet Banjo Paterson without any historical authority, for instance: a restaurant bearing his name, in a house reputed to belong to his grandmother and where he spent some years as a young man, is testimony to the neglect of our cultural icons.</p> <p>Miles Franklin\u2019s name adorns our most prestigious literary awards but her family homestead Brindabella, rebuilt after a fire in 1900, remains in private hands. The property on the ACT and New South Wales border is described as \u201ca cradle of national culture, loved and lived in by an assembly of notable Australians including Banjo Paterson\u201d in the real estate blurb each time it appears for sale.</p> <p>Of course, that disregard for our heritage extends well beyond colonial culture. Just this week, we learned that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/26/rio-tinto-blasts-46000-year-old-aboriginal-site-to-expand-iron-ore-mine\">mining company Rio Tinto exploded a sacred site in Western Australia</a> \u2013 the only inland site in Australia that showed 46,000 years of continual occupation, and one which provided a crucial 4,000-year-old genetic link to Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura traditional owners living today.<em>&nbsp;</em></p> <p>That loss is on an incomparable and devastating scale \u2013 more proof, although none was needed, that we are not working urgently enough to protect our nation\u2019s history before it is lost to us forever.&nbsp;As David Yeneken wrote in his book Valuing Australia\u2019s National Heritage: \u201cOnce destroyed, [historic places] can never be replaced.\u201d</p> <p>All governments at all levels have a duty of care to our heritage \u2013 prime minister Scott Morrison admitted as much in his speech to the National Press Club this week. His roadmap for recovery post-Covid-19 included \u201cresponsible management and stewardship of what has been left to us to sustainably manage for current and future generations. This is as much true for our environmental, cultural and natural resources as it for our economic and financial ones.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>In the case of Dorothea Mackellar, Whitehaven Coal claims it is committed to preserving the historic homestead and restoring the gardens, and has donated $500,000 to make a start on the latter. But it is not only the homestead that is important here. It is the vistas and the outbuildings. The vantage points Mackellar exploited while scratching away in her verse books. It is the landscape it sits in, plains and hills and rivers all.</p> <p>If the integrity of the landscape is compromised, if the context of the building is destroyed, then so is the history of a poem that lit up the national psyche and gave us pride in a country that Mackellar believed was more beautiful, more exotic and more confronting than anything England could lay claim to. We still have time to give future generations the chance to walk the halls of that homestead and gaze upon that landscape, seeing it through Mackellar\u2019s eyes and hearing her lyrics echoing across the countryside.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b7dc2f4a34b6316f5b227afaa6a2e899134dfa56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7dc2f4a34b6316f5b227afaa6a2e899134dfa56/0_0_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An outbuilding of Dorothea MacKellar's  homestead Kurrumbede\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It is not only the homestead that is important here.

The poem was published in the Spectator<em> </em>in London in September of that year.&nbsp;</p> <p>In her extensive diaries, Mackellar writes about Kurrumbede with great affection. In an entry from March 1911, Mackellar arrived at the property and rushed down to the Namoi river to see a team of bullocks, 28 in all, taking timber across the waterway. In November 1918, the Mackellars were at Kurrumbede when word came that the Armistice had been signed. \u201cAt the end of a hot afternoon, a storm broke on us after waltzing completely around the horizon. I\u2019ll not forget the two dust-devils who strode across the plain just ahead of that black-purple storm.\u201d The Mackellars drove into Gunnedah just in time to hear the tail-end of the Royal Proclamation, and the rattling of cans and the tooting of horns.</p> <p>Philippa Murray, chairwoman of the Dorothea Mackellar Memorial Society based in Gunnedah, said the society wanted to see Kurrumbede enjoyed by the wider community. \u201cThere is a strong interest in the house and its history. We envisage it as a place to hold public events such as concerts, gatherings and even a literary or poetry festival.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Whitehaven Coal is now working on a conservation management plan \u2013&nbsp;but given it has owned the property since 2013, and a decision on the mine expansion is imminent, why wasn\u2019t the plan already in place? And while the NSW Heritage Council is currently considering listing the homestead and outbuildings on the State Heritage Register, the decision to expand the mine will be made <em>before</em> the findings are released.&nbsp;</p> <p>My Country evoked a common powerful connection to the Australian landscape at a time when the country was finding its feet politically and socially. It has had an immeasurable impact on the collective consciousness of Australians, and for many it remains the ultimate expression of the centrality of the land to the Australian identity.</p> <p>We still love our sunburnt country. When the mine is long gone from Kurrumbede and the scarred earth begins a slow rebirth, how much will we have lost?</p> <p><em>\u2022&nbsp;Deborah FitzGerald is writing a biography of Dorothea Mackellar, due out 2021 (Simon &amp; Schuster Australia)</em></p>",

India has been under one of the world\u2019s strictest lockdowns since 24 March, but it has only slowed down the spread of the virus, rather than flattening the curve of cases. India ranks 4th in the world for new cases recorded each day, and with lockdown due to be loosened at the end of this week there are fears it will prompt a spike in infection rates, for which the hospitals are not prepared. India has had 158,000 reported cases.</p> <p>To complicate matters further, the beginning of June will bring the monsoon and the outbreaks of dengue fever, malaria and leptospirosis, which already inundate hospitals on an annual basis. Last year India officially reported more than 67,000 cases of dengue, though the real figure is thought to be much higher.</p> <p>According to the human rights activist Abraham Mathai, who runs the All India Nurses Association, dozens of patients with non-Covid related diseases are dying because they are being denied access to treatment, with some Mumbai hospitals ordered to only take in Covid-19 patients. Last week, 15-year-old Pawan Maddibona died after six hospitals refused to give him dialysis treatment for his kidneys.</p> <p>\u201cNon-Covid patients have a right to live, they have a right to get their treatments,\u201d said Mathai. \u201cThere has to be some kind of balanced policies so non-Covid patients don\u2019t suffer.\u201d</p> <p>Shetty from Guru Nanak hospital said his main fear was the as-yet unknown combination of coronavirus with the monsoon diseases, something other countries further through the pandemic had not been forced to face. \u201cIt will be a whole worrying new realm,\u201d he said. \u201cMy guess is we will need a lot of beds to cope.\u201d</p>"
