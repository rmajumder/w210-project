  "<p>Amid coronavirus-induced stockpiling and empty supermarket shelves, politicians have been quick to assure us of the reliability of Australia\u2019s food supply systems.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2020/mar/19/dont-panic-australia-the-coronavirus-doesnt-mean-well-run-out-of-food\">Writing for the Guardian last week</a>, agriculture minister David Littleproud slammed \u201cridiculous\u201d panic-buying, saying: \u201cIt is important to understand that Australian farmers produce enough food for 75 million people: three times what we need\u201d. Farmers, he continued, are \u201ccalmly going about the business of food production\u201d, \u201cpreparing to sow and pick their crops and making sure their produce makes it to market\u201d.</p> <p>But the reality is that the business of food production relies upon tens of thousands of workers, a huge proportion of which are seasonal workers and migrants.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2020/mar/19/dont-panic-australia-the-coronavirus-doesnt-mean-well-run-out-of-food\">Don't panic, Australia. The coronavirus doesn't mean we'll run out of food | David Littleproud</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As borders close and social distancing increases in order to flatten the curve of infection rates, we need to think urgently about the workforce on whom our food supply chains rely. </p> <p>Neither Littleproud nor the agricultural industry are oblivious to the reliance on migrant workers. The agriculture minister described the need to \u201csecure labour\u201d, promising \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/two-million-temporary-visa-holders-in-australia-left-in-limbo-by-coronavirus-travel-standstill\">minor tweaking</a>\u201d to the visa system with the implication being that the some of the 140,000 working holiday makers and 7,000 seasonal workers currently in the country may have their visas extended to enable them to continue working here. The National Farmers\u2019 Federation (NFF) is seeking assurances of a continuous supply of overseas workers, particularly for the horticultural sector.</p> <p>Both the NFF and federal government talk about securing a supply of agricultural labour as if it were akin to securing a reliable supply of engine parts. But the agricultural workforce is not a collection of supply chain inputs, it is hundreds of thousands of workers \u2014 people with families, with communities, with livelihoods to sustain, and bodies as vulnerable to infections and ill-health (and in some cases more so) as any others.</p> <p>In horticulture, the challenges are significant. The industry is in the middle of the harvest season, a critical point in the production cycle when demands for labour are at their peak. Temporary migrant and local seasonal workers are picking fruit, harvesting vegetables, and sorting and packing crops in packing sheds across the country.</p> <p>Thousands of these workers are Pacific Islanders, working here under the Seasonal Worker Programme (SWP) which provides strictly curtailed visas intended to fill demands for, particularly, seasonal horticultural labour. Many groups of workers are due to return to their home countries in the coming weeks and months. I have spoken to one labour contractor who has a group of SWP workers due to fly home within days. Their flights are now cancelled with their visas currently due to expire the next day. Other groups of workers, due to arrive in Australia now to perform critical harvest labour, are unable to leave their homes as Pacific nations close their borders.</p> <p>\u201cMinor tweaking\u201d to the visa system may address part of their problem, enabling them to stay and work for longer (although, at the time we spoke, the contractor had not received any direction from the department of employment which manages the program) but it will not address the much bigger human and political challenges.</p> <p>What if Pacific Islanders (or backpackers, or other temporary migrant workers) don\u2019t want to be used as an ongoing source of labour beyond what they have already contracted to provide? If the present situation continues for six or twelve months, or longer, what kinds of incentives or coercions are going to be employed to sustain the agricultural workforce?</p> <p>For those who do continue working, what are the health implications and risks of doing so? Workers in packing sheds work in close proximity for long hours, and pickers often live in crowded, shared accommodation. These jobs, like so many low-paid manual and service industry jobs, cannot be worked from home, a fact that highlights the dramatically unequal levels of risk and vulnerability for different, often racialised, groups of workers.</p> <p>If sheds, orchards, and other food production sites shut down amid health concerns, what will be the financial impacts on agricultural sector workers \u2013 both temporary and local \u2013 who are overwhelmingly casual and without sick leave and other entitlements? Is the federal government prepared to commit to covering the costs of healthcare and any lost income due to infection of the labour force whose supply it is seeking to secure? It should.</p> <p>If and when workers do return home, how will we ensure that we are not sending potentially infected people back to countries and communities across the region whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/23/pacific-nations-prepare-for-coronavirus-arrival-after-devastating-measles-outbreak\">health systems are ill-equipped to manage the crises that widespread Covid-19 infection would produce</a>? Pacific nations have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/papua-new-guinea-declares-state-of-emergency-after-first-coronavirus-case\">begun to see their first cases of the virus</a>, and the impacts of widening infection could be catastrophic. Our responsibilities to the region demand that we do not endanger it.</p> <p>David Littleproud ended his piece with a call to his \u201cfellow Australians\u201d to work together and to support \u201cour farmers\u201d. One of the many, very real dangers of this epidemic is that it will amplify an inward-looking nationalism, and an intensification of all kinds of borders (physical, political, social, cultural) long after the Covid-19 threat has diminished.</p> <p>Let\u2019s by all means think about the business of food production. But let\u2019s do that in ways that do not fall back on ill-conceived notions of national self-sufficiency. What the Covid-19 pandemic and its impacts on our food systems should highlight for us is our deep enmeshment in regional and global networks, and our responsibilities to all of those who feed us.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Victoria Stead is an anthropologist and senior research fellow at the Alfred Deakin Institute, Deakin University.

It has never been triggered until now. <br><br>The EU statement said that ministers remained \u201cfully committed to the respect of the stability and growth pact\u201d. But now the taboo has been broken, it is unclear how quickly the EU can return to its fiscal rules. <br><br>Eurozone watchers also predict that triggering the escape clause mean more ambitious measures could be off the table, such as \u201ccoronabonds\u201d - common eurozone debt to help the most distressed member states finance health spending and repair their battered economies. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MehreenKhn/status/1242134600664715264\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Dutch finance minister says effective suspension of EU budget rules is enough for governments to spend to counter  the coronavirus.

She became homeless more than two years ago when she was evicted from her property for falling behind on her rent. She was in a coma in hospital at the time and hadn\u2019t been able to pay her landlord because of her illness. She used to sleep on night buses, but has been in a hostel for 14 months.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a scary thing for a lot of people,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can see the fear in a lot of people\u2019s eyes. I suffer with my lungs. People are saying it\u2019s worse for us because we\u2019re homeless.\u201d</p> <p>While the situation is worrying, specialist homeless clinicians, charities and local authorities are working together to come up with innovative solutions to the huge problems they face. The government has set aside <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/3-2-million-emergency-support-for-rough-sleepers-during-coronavirus-outbreak\">\u00a33.2m for rough sleepers</a> and Prof Andrew Hayward and Dr Al Story at University College London have developed a plan that is being circulated to local authorities and clinical commissioning groups in the hope that they will adopt its recommendations to be able to test patients and staff, triage people and then house them in places \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/21/uk-hotels-homeless-shelters-coronavirus\">hotels are being set aside</a> \u2013 where they can be cared for.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14025b45f8b4446cf6dfe08207334cc73b2e458d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14025b45f8b4446cf6dfe08207334cc73b2e458d/0_135_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Dana Beale (left) and Dr Natalie Miller work with homeless patients in Westminster.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Dana Beale (left) and Dr Natalie Miller work with homeless patients in Westminster.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, specialist homeless GP practices have had to adapt. They are running most appointments over the phone. But getting information and messages out to their client group, a large number of whom don\u2019t use or have phones, has been challenging. Dr Tim Worthley, lead GP at <a href=\"https://www.archhealthcare.uk/\">Arch Healthcare</a> in Brighton, which has 1,400 registered homeless patients, says handing out phones has been invaluable.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve handed out four this morning already,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had one person coughing and spluttering with a fever that he\u2019d developed overnight who had no one to contact. He\u2019d been out of prison for five days and in temporary accommodation. I very quickly assessed him in the waiting room, gave him a phone and rang him later to assess him properly.\u201d</p> <p>Worthley has developed a spreadsheet to keep tabs on anyone who is self-isolating. He takes their details and talks through what mental health, physical and substance misuse needs they have; whether they need food, have access to money and what level of risk they are. \u201cAt the moment, we have between 10 and 15 on the list. There have been a few more this morning.\u201d</p> <p>This system has been potentially life-saving already. He explains: \u201cWe sent someone to hospital a few days ago who had rung NHS 111 and been told they would not be got back to until the following evening. We rang her up and she was deteriorating quickly and she hadn\u2019t thought to contact anyone to let them know. She\u2019s now in hospital, but I don\u2019t know yet whether it was coronavirus.\u201d</p> <p>One challenge proving impossible to overcome is the lack of testing available both for staff and homeless people. \u201cGPs are struggling with this. All the while we can\u2019t test, we are operating in the dark. We desperately need to test ourselves and patients,\u201d says Worthley.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The hope is that we will realise that people don\u2019t need to sleep rough and that there are alternatives when we get through this crisis.</p> <footer> <cite>Dr Tim Worthley</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Specialist homeless GP practices tend to be staffed by small teams, so if one person goes off, it leaves a huge gap.</p> <p>In Leicester, Dr Anna Hiley, who works at <a href=\"https://inclusionpractice.co.uk/\">Inclusion Healthcare</a> with 800 registered homeless patients and 1,000 registered asylum-seeker patients, has had to work hard to issue guidance in up to 45 different languages.

For non English-speaking people there\u2019s confusion about what they should do. We feel a bit like we\u2019re waiting for something and desperately trying to get ready for it.\u201d</p> <p>This is a sentiment shared by Dr Natalie Miller and Dr Dana Beale at <a href=\"https://greatchapelst.org.uk/\">Great Chapel Street medical centre</a> in Westminster. They started early in coming up with a way to carry on functioning during the outbreak by contacting other organisations responsible for helping homeless people and thinking about what changes they needed to make. They\u2019ve been encouraged by the way charities, the local clinical commissioning group and local authority have come together.</p> <p>Now, they, along with many others, are keen to find places to host homeless people, both those who have symptoms of Covid-19 and those who need to stay safe. \u201cThe medical infrastructure is rapidly being put together. If we can quickly<strong> </strong>get the hotels and places where we can deliver care, we can mitigate a lot of deaths,\u201d says Beale.</p> <p>For now, people continue to sleep rough, making self-isolating virtually impossible. It is also not feasible for those living in hostels and temporary accommodation: many have shared facilities, while some have no kitchens and must go out every day for food.</p> <p>Swash, as she sits in her hostel, knows that the future is uncertain. \u201cI would like to think there\u2019s support. I think they\u2019re putting things in place \u2026 and staff are doing the best they can do.

  "<p>There\u2019s a disconnect between the reality and the perception of electric vehicles (EV). Forecasts suggest a medium-term crossover point, probably towards the end of this decade, where the car industry is making more EVs than internal combustion engine (ICE) cars. Against that, there still exists a great deal of scepticism in the minds of consumers.</p> <p>\u201cAn EV wouldn\u2019t work for me because \u2026\u201d<em> </em>is a familiar conversation starter. It\u2019s true, there are some people for whom an electric car is simply a non-starter \u2013 but that number is a vanishingly small percentage of the population. For most, an EV is going to be a money saver that makes no obvious impact on lifestyle.</p> <p>Emily Rice, Renault UK\u2019s product manager for electric cars, answers three readers\u2019 questions.</p> <p><strong>I live in a terraced house and park in the street, so I\u2019m unable to have a home charging point. What are my charging options? </strong>Elaine Hills, Brighton</p> <p>Although it\u2019s true that many current EV owners like to charge their cars at home using a dedicated wall-mounted charger in their driveway or garage, the good news is it\u2019s far from the only option.</p> <p>The charging infrastructure to support EVs is constantly growing and evolving. For instance, it was reported in May last year that <a href=\"https://www.londoncouncils.gov.uk/our-key-themes/transport/roads/gulcs\" rel=\"nofollow\">1,076 new residential EV charging points had been installed in London as part of the Go Ultra Low City Scheme (GULCS)</a>, and this figure continues to increase. <a href=\"https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2019/01/virgin-media-uk-harness-broadband-cabinets-for-ev-car-charging.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Virgin Media recently began a pilot project to convert its broadband cabinets into charging points</a>, with a view to eventually providing 40,000 EV charging points across the UK. Elsewhere, there are initiatives such as the MK Promise, through which Milton Keynes council offers to install, within a short walk, an overnight charging point for all new EV owners lacking access to private parking.</p> <p>Access to a public residential charger is, however, still rare, and the much more common practice is to charge at the other end of a regular journey. \u201cIf you\u2019d like to buy an EV, but don\u2019t have the ability to charge it at home, check whether your workplace has charging facilities,\u201d says Rice. \u201cIt\u2019s common to simply not notice charging infrastructure if you don\u2019t own an EV \u2013 but once you start thinking about switching, you really start to notice how many charging points are around you.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/the-power-of-firsts/2020/feb/12/seven-facts-that-will-convince-you-to-make-the-switch-to-an-electric-car\">Seven facts that will convince you to make the switch to an electric car</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Based on data from the various infrastructure suppliers, it is estimated that 90% of charging is done at home or at work. Only 3% takes place en route to a destination, with the rest made up of people who \u201cgraze\u201d \u2013 charging in short bursts at the supermarket, the gym, or a municipal car park. Coffee shops are getting in on the act too, recognising that a half-hour charging cycle is even better than free wifi for creating a captive audience.</p> <p>It\u2019s worth noting that the notional \u201cfull charge\u201d is an ICE hangover, driving until the warning light comes on and then filling the tank. Getting a full charge in Sainsbury\u2019s or Starbucks may take a few hours \u2013 but with EVs such as the New Renault ZOE having a driving range of 245 miles*, it is unlikely you will need to find somewhere to charge every day, so owners aren\u2019t arriving with the (usually metaphorical) needle in the red.</p> <p>If you\u2019re doing the average <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/657839/commuting-in-england-1988-2015.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">10-mile commute</a> twice a day, then an EV can recharge in the time it takes to whizz around the aisles or gulp down a skinny latte. There is massive growth in the number of places offering a charging point. <a href=\"https://www.zap-map.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zap Map</a>, the handy EV app and website, lists more than 31,000 connectors spread across more than 17,800 devices in more than 11,000 locations across the UK \u2013 and the figures are going up daily. More than <a href=\"https://www.zap-map.com/supermarket-ev-charge-point-numbers-double-in-two-years/\" rel=\"nofollow\">6% of the charge points are now found at supermarkets</a>.</p> <p><strong>If you charge an EV and then don\u2019t use it, have you wasted your electricity? </strong>Jonathan Bailey, Sheffield</p> <p>The short answer is: no. Or rather, not really. \u201cThe thing people tend to ask about is leaving their car when they go on holiday,\u201d says Rice. \u201cIf you leave your car at the airport for a couple of weeks, you\u2019re not going to notice a discharge. There\u2019s lots of inbuilt technology in a Renault ZOE designed to ensure the batteries are as efficient as possible. Even if you leave your EV sitting around for a few months, it\u2019s not going to be an issue for the traction battery.\u201d</p> <p>The concern allied to this is the idea that battery performance will be less impressive as the vehicle gets older. While battery capacity can drop as the vehicle gets older \u2013 it won\u2019t be to the extent it did a decade ago when the technology was in its infancy.</p> <p>\u201cI think a lot of people worry that the battery in an EV is like the one in their phone, and they\u2019re going to see the performance decline after a couple of years \u2013 but it really isn\u2019t like that,\u201d says Rice. \u201cWe all know that a phone reaches a point where you\u2019re having to charge it a couple of times a day \u2013 but the technology in the lithium-ion battery of the car is far superior to that. If you\u2019re driving it in the same way as a petrol or diesel car, you\u2019re not going to experience any problems with an EV. We know it\u2019s an area of concern, though, which is why Renault gives its EV batteries an eight-year or 100,000-mile <a href=\"https://www.renault.co.uk/warranty.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">warranty</a>**. Hopefully that inspires confidence in the technology.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b1b1a13d5a9661b251ec57ac46be32bae38d0fcd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1b1a13d5a9661b251ec57ac46be32bae38d0fcd/0_262_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Handsome young man with a laptop near charging electric car\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">EVs require less maintenance than cars with engines, and all of Renault\u2019s technicians are EV-trained.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Grytsku/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Is it more difficult to get a problem with an EV car resolved because there are fewer expert mechanics? </strong>Edward Jones, Northamptonshire</p> <p>The good news with an electric vehicle is that there are fewer moving parts to go wrong, so service plans are correspondingly cheaper. \u201cWe estimate the cars are, on average, 25% cheaper to maintain,\u201d says Rice. \u201cThere\u2019s no oil to change at a service, no - requiring replacement after five years. Your brakes and tyres wear slightly less with the EV\u2019s more efficient regenerative braking. You will find savings not only in fuelling the vehicle but also servicing it.\u201d</p> <p>On the flip side, while EVs require less maintenance, they also require <em>different </em>maintenance. While 100% of the Renault dealer network are EV trained, across the industry the figures are mixed. According to research by the Institute of the Motor Industry, by the end of 2018, <a href=\"https://www.ingeniarecruitment.co.uk/according-to-imi-only-3-of-uk-technicians-are-qualified-to-work-on-evs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">only 3% of technicians were qualified to work on EVs</a>. While that sounds bad, it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that <a href=\"https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/news/motoring-news/twice-as-many-drivers-plan-to-go-electric-next-time-round/\" rel=\"nofollow\">fewer than 1% UK cars are pure electric</a> so, if anything, there are more technicians available per electric vehicle than there are for conventional cars.</p> <p>The downside is that most of these technicians are employed by mainstream dealerships, with relatively little EV expertise in backstreet garages. EVs are, however, selling in ever-larger numbers, and mechanics are not immune to market forces. More technicians will train on EVs because, slowly but surely, that\u2019s where the market is heading.</p> <p><em><strong>Curious to learn more about EVs?

That meant Italy had missed many more cases than Australia, he said. </li> \n   <li><strong>Testing criteria in Australia will change in the next week</strong> as the number of overseas travellers drops dramatically, Kelly says. Testing has to date been focused on overseas travellers, but mandatory quarantine requirements and travel bans mean the number of travellers arriving had fallen significantly.</li> \n   <li><strong>Norman Swan </strong>suggested Australia was <strong>still missing asymptomatic cases of Covid-19</strong>, because it was not testing widely enough.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>We will leave our Australia-specific coverage of the coronavirus crisis there for tonight.

Most of our people in prison have chronic health issues and are living with disability; they are most at risk. With the over-representation of our people in prison, our lives are on the line.</p> \n   <p>People in prison are extremely vulnerable to Covid-19. This is why we are calling for immediate early release, particularly people who are on remand, women who are victims of family violence and sentenced for lesser offences like fines and public order offences, young people and those most at risk of transmitting Covid-19, like elderly and people with health conditions. At all costs, we must prevent any Aboriginal deaths in custody from Covid-19. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Natsils also warned against blanket lockdowns or solitary confinement by prisons trying to manage a possible outbreak. It comes as prisons have suspended all visits for the time being.

It is too soon for the measures introduced only last week to have impacted on the epidemiology, but we are seeing evidence of non-compliance with these new measures, people not taking this seriously. <strong>We have also now had two \u2018super spreader\u2019 events in Sydney \u2013 one a wedding (35 infected) and one at a church servi</strong><strong>ce.</strong></p> \n   <p>There is a strong argument to do more, at least in the short term, to enforce the new way of life in social distancing that we will have to endure and to adapt the community mindset. This will also allow more time to consolidate health system preparations and evaluate measures already implemented in Australia, and to learn from interventions in other countries.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>It also explained the rationale for not recommending school closures, noting that \u201cone state [Victoria] has elected to bring forward Easter school holidays\u201d.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>AHPPC does not support the closure of schools given the lack of evidence of significant disease in children and the lack of reported major disease spreading in schools.</p> \n   <p>Furthermore, <strong>the closure of schools poses a major risk to children\u2019s education, mental health and wellbeing, particularly those from low socioeconomic regions</strong>, where schools provide an important environment for nurturing and learning. The impact on the critical workforce and potential <strong>exposure of elderly relatives caring for children is also of significance</strong>.

That means that if you contact Centrelink today about wanting to apply for unemployment benefits, but are unable to complete your application, <strong>you will be back paid from that first contact</strong>. (The government actually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/13/coalition-warned-welfare-overhaul-could-worsen-poverty-and-unemployment\">abolished this in 2018 to save money</a>.)</p> \n  <p>Crucially, Robert said <strong>people starting a new Jobseeker Payment claim could verify their identity over the phone,</strong> rather than by submitting their documents at a Centrelink office. This change was slated for April and has apparently been brought forward.</p> \n  <p>That is, <strong>you do not need to go to a Centrelink office to complete your claim</strong>. In fact, Robert said there were fewer staff at the shopfronts due to social distancing rules.</p> \n  <p>This does not get around the fact that getting through over the phone to Centrelink can take hours, let alone at a time like this.</p> \n  <p>Robert also said he was extending Centrelink call centre opening hours to 8am to 8pm (NSW time). The government is hiring up to 5,000 new staff at Services Australia to cater with demand, but it remains to be seen how quickly these employees can start.</p> \n  <p>Now, onto the <strong>MyGov website</strong>. Robert said the website suffered a DDoS attack (when a website is flooded with hits, essentially a cyber attack) but wouldn\u2019t give any more details.</p> \n  <p>He said the government had MyGov\u2019s upgraded capacity by 10 times. It could now operate with 55,000 concurrent users and, he said, in fact the website never crashed.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-23T03:14:30.207Z\">at 3.14am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7826a58f08a08573fbf8d1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-23T03:02:14.290Z\">3.02am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Australia has<strong> 1609 </strong>cases of Covid-19.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-23T03:05:17.000Z\">at 3.05am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7826028f08dcc95cc21451\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-23T03:00:15.861Z\">3.00am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The bells are ringing for question time.</p> \n  <p>Given that this is not the politics live blog, I\u2019ll be doing it a little differently than usual (I mean, it is 2o20, and nothing is the same right now) and only bringing you the main points, as we continue to monitor all the Covid-19 changes. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-23T03:06:05.595Z\">at 3.06am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7825a58f08e0999e6b8461\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-23T02:58:28.423Z\">2.58am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>For anyone who needs some soothing, there are these photos (from before she was in isolation):</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AlexMLeo/status/1241708286921056258\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Merkel buying 4 bottles of wine &amp;

Many health groups and medical associations have been calling for increased support to roll out the technology more widely and rapidly.<br><br>The federal government<a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/covid-19-national-health-plan-primary-care-bulk-billed-mbs-telehealth-services\"> introduced temporary Medicare Benefits Schedule and Department of Veterans\u2019 Affairs items to allow doctors, nurses, midwives and mental health professionals to deliver services via telehealth</a>, provided those services are bulk billed, so that people in self-isolation or quarantine can get health care.<br><br><strong>This is a temporary six-month measure</strong>. People who meet the testing guidelines for Covid-19, people aged over 70, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged over 50, people with chronic health conditions or who are immunocompromised, and parents with new babies and people who are pregnant can access the bulk-billed Telehealth services.<br><br><strong>The thousands of doctors who have signed the letter say this is too restrictive.</strong><br><br>It comes \u201cwith special criteria that make it so ineffective it\u2019s practically useless,\u201d the letter says. \u201cDefining \u2018special groups\u2019 who are eligible for bulk-billed telehealth, leaving all others out in the cold - when normally all medical care attracts a rebate is simply un-Australian and tone deaf, especially when many of our community are losing their jobs and facing<br>financial hardship.<br><br>\u201cThe symptoms of coronavirus are identical to those of many other viruses. As the virus spreads in the community, it will be increasingly difficult to tell them all apart. By allowing telehealth access for all it will enable pre-emptive remote screening, without the risk of onward transmission.

With a new and deadly infectious disease, anything that reduces contact with infected people will reduce onward transmission.

  "<p>As a millennial, much of my adulthood has been punctuated by severe national emergencies. The first my generation experienced was the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001. We all watched in horror as the months-long media spectacle replayed footage of the towers swallowing airplanes and crumbling into fire and dust. The moment of national solidarity and everyday heroism was brief.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/er-doctor-coronavirus-exponential-growth\">I'm an ER doctor. Please take coronavirus seriously | Clayton Dalton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The government quickly responded by attempting to achieve two things: one, expanding executive power, and two, transferring public wealth into private corporations. The Bush administration achieved the first by passing the Patriot Act, which built the foundation for what is probably the world\u2019s most <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/issues/national-security/privacy-and-surveillance/surveillance-under-patriot-act\">expansive surveillance state</a>, but also by setting legal precedents that <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/george-w-bush-vs-the-constitution/\">violated basic constitutional rights</a> and by creating the Department for Homeland Security, with its <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-citizens-ice-20180427-htmlstory.html\">aggressive</a> constituent agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The second goal was achieved with the \u201cwar on terror\u201d, which involved unilateral occupations of Afghanistan and Iraq, and subsequent <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/02/secret-war-africa-pentagon-664005\">military forays</a> into many African countries. In Iraq, private security, logistics and reconstruction contractors <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7f435f04-8c05-11e2-b001-00144feabdc0\">swallowed up</a> $138bn alone. Since 2001, $5.9tn in taxpayer dollars have <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/14/us-has-spent-5point9-trillion-on-middle-east-asia-wars-since-2001-study.html\">gone toward</a> wars (not to mention resulted in <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/11/19/civilian-casualties-us-war-on-terror/\">hundreds of thousands of deaths</a> and a foreign policy blackhole that still haunts the Middle East). Neither of these goals addressed the root cause of the crisis, and <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/terrorism\">arguably exacerbated</a> the conditions that led to 9/11.</p> <p>The second national emergency my generation experienced was the 2008 housing bubble collapse and subsequent recession: the most severe economic meltdown since the Great Depression. Again the federal government, this time under Barack Obama\u2019s administration, sought to exploit the crisis to move vast wealth from the public treasury into private bank accounts. A <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2009/12/real-size-bailout-treasury-fed/\">staggering $14tn</a> was transferred from taxpayers to private hands, including Wall Street executives who used that money to continue giving themselves seven-figure bonuses. One of the largest recipients of bailout money, Citigroup, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jul/31/wall-street-bonuses-bailout\">paid out $5.3bn</a> to employees in bonuses. While the federal government debatably halted a further stock market collapse, they certainly did not address the root cause of the crisis. A mere 11 years later and we are again standing on the edge of a major economic crisis.</p> <p>Ecological devastation, meanwhile, is the quiet crisis amplifier that has persisted through both of these national emergencies and cast a shadow over the whole of my generation. Its latest iteration is the Covid-19 pandemic, <a href=\"https://grist.org/climate/a-common-germ-pool-the-frightening-environmental-origins-of-covid-19/\">whose origins lay</a> in habitat destruction and biodiversity loss.</p> <p>Once again, the federal government appears poised to exploit this emergency to expand executive power and move wealth from the public treasury into private bank accounts. As the Nation <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/society/coronavirus-trump-pandemic/\">recently reported</a>, an internal CBP directive empowers the agency to indefinitely monitor and detain anyone suspected of carrying the virus. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has <a href=\"https://www.ecowatch.com/trump-oil-industry-coronavirus-2645487635.html?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1\">begun a bailout</a> for the oil industry, which could exceed $2.6bn in tax dollars going to oil industry control, and is <a href=\"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2020/03/18/coronavirus-travel-bailout-trump-says-airlines-would-no-1/2867020001/\">toying with</a> the idea of an airline industry bailout, which could exceed $50bn.</p> <p>The authoritarian lockdowns in China and Italy may soon arrive to the anglophone world. Seeing self-avowed leftists and liberals praising such draconian reactions is frightening. Anyone who cares about democracy and civil liberty should not welcome such responses. As we witnessed with the authoritarian reactions to 9/11, emergency violations of civil liberties are not easily rolled back, and often aggregate over time. In the wake of 9/11, Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act, which gave sweeping powers to the executive branch. In 2012, Obama signed an expanded version into law, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/05/01/ndaa-2018-aumf-detention/\">which gave the president the power</a> to \u201chold individuals, including US citizens, in military detention indefinitely\u201d, which means for life. We must reject such authoritarian measures wholly, no matter who says they\u2019re \u201cnecessary\u201d.</p> <p>The fact is, neither expanding executive power nor redistributing wealth upward will save lives or address the root cause of the crisis. In fact, both the oil and airline industries are accelerating the ecological devastation at the heart of this pandemic. As ecological collapse continues to unfold, more and more emergencies like this will occur with greater frequency and intensity. Now is the time to break out of the recurring pattern in which national responses not only fail to solve the problem, but even exacerbate the original cause, while transferring wealth from taxpayers to already-wealthy, well-connected executives. Instead, now is the time to implement a set of standards for what constitutes a response that puts the common good at the center.</p> <p>In the case of this virus, there are plenty of good ideas already being discussed that would do exactly that. Instead of moving public wealth into private corporations, the government should be doing the opposite.</p> <p>The first step to containing this virus is handing out cash to every American to fund their ability to self-isolate without having to go to work. A basic income of, at minimum, subsistence rate would achieve this. The New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/13/andrew-yang-aoc-free-ubi-cash-can-help-during-coronavirus-pandemic.html\">has called</a> for implementing an emergency universal basic income, while presidential candidate Bernie Sanders <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-bernie-sanders-calls-for-monthly-2000-cash-payments-2020-3\">suggested delivering</a> a monthly $2,000 check to every household to deal with lost income.</p> <p>Providing universal healthcare, both during the virus flareup and after, would also go a long way to containing its spread and reducing its seasonal intensity; the for-profit system is <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2020/02/26/americas-patchwork-for-profit-healthcare-system-poised-to-worsen-coronavirus-outbreak/\">probably exacerbating</a> the spread of the virus. Subsidizing or even nationalizing essential goods and services like utilities, pharmaceuticals and distribution of basic necessities could also help contain the virus and reduce its negative long-term impacts, and ensure that those services remain available to all. The Trump administration has (surprisingly) <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/488227-trump-orders-hud-to-suspend-evictions-and-foreclosures\">ordered</a> the Department of Housing and Urban Development to halt evictions and foreclosures temporarily. Taking that further and reforming or eliminating them, even past the worst of the pandemic, could help soften conditions leading to virus spreading in the future.</p> <p>Interim support for local services, like small businesses and charities, would also help keep local infrastructure intact beyond the most intense phases of social isolation. Dismantling the prison industrial complex and deeply reforming the justice system would help as well. The US has the highest incarceration rate and absolute prison population in the world. Abolishing the institution would go a long way toward reducing the impact of highly infectious viruses, given that prisons are \u201c<a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/03/correctional-facilities-are-the-perfect-incubators-for-the-coronavirus/\">the perfect incubators</a>\u201d for coronaviruses. Finally, bypassing intellectual property laws with regard to vaccine development, and preventing anyone from limiting access for private profit, would also be important, both now and beyond the pandemic.</p> <p>Of course the best thing we can do is halt the twin ecological and climate crises that are now driving so many existential emergencies like the Covid-19 pandemic. But, in the meantime of attending to that herculean task, the least we can be doing is agreeing on a set of responses that reject authoritarian exercises of executive power and the further enrichment of the already wealthy at the expense of the public. Instead, we should be responding to such national crises by saving lives and fortifying the common good. Through a series of compounding national emergencies, a benevolent response would be the first my generation has ever witnessed.</p> <ul> <li><p>Samuel Miller McDonald studies climate and energy politics at Oxford University</p></li> </ul>",

  "<p>Retirees David and Denise Morse were celebrating their 45th wedding anniversary with a 15-day trip aboard the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/from-paradise-to-coronavirus-the-grand-princess-and-the-cruise-from-hell\">Grand Princess cruise liner</a> when 19 crew members and two passengers aboard the ship were diagnosed with the coronavirus.</p> <p>The original itinerary had the Morses arriving in Ensenada, Mexico, from Hawaii on 5 March, and returning home to San Francisco two days later. Instead, the cruise liner was held off the San Francisco coast for several days, until it docked in the Port of Oakland on 9 March.</p> <p>The 2,000 passengers on board disembarked over the course of three days. More than 800 California residents were sent to Travis air force base in Fairfield, about 47 miles north-east of San Francisco , to serve out a 14-day quarantine.</p> <p>David and Denise are keeping a diary documenting their stay there.</p> <h2><strong>11 March</strong></h2> <p><strong>David, 10.</strong><strong>35</strong><strong>am \u2013</strong><strong> </strong>I don\u2019t know what this is going to be \u2013 a journal, story or what. I just wanted to write down some of the many thoughts I have had as we go through this surreal ordeal.<strong> </strong>We are on the fourth floor of the Westwind Inn hotel, on the property of Travis air force base. Got in our room at 9.30pm last night, after a long day that started at 6am on the ship.</p> <p>We had been dressed and ready to depart our stateroom C314 on the 10th floor, at 7am. The ship had arrived in Oakland the previous day, and passengers had begun disembarking \u2013 the sick and elderly first. We couldn\u2019t see much from what was going on. All the action was on the starboard side, and we were on port.</p> <p>We waited more than six hours for our turn today. My impression is that Princess Cruises is very experienced in handling large groups, feeding, giving instructions and disembarking procedures. They have it together. On the land, it\u2019s more politically and medically challenging, as officials have to coordinate between cities, states and the federal government.</p> <p>This morning, we thought we had to get up for our coronavirus test at 7.15am. On 6 March, Vice-President Pence had announced that everyone disembarking from the boat would be tested for coronavirus.</p> <p>We scrambled to the elevator area, only to find that the staff were handing out breakfast boxes. So, no testing. At 9.30am, they gave us a temperature check and symptom questions. We were told we would be tested only if we show symptoms. Is that because there is a shortage of testing supplies?</p> <p>We went downstairs and found a large group of masked passengers in line for coffee and using their bare hands to get juice cartons and breakfast boxes.</p> <h2><strong>12 March</strong></h2> <p><strong>David, 8.</strong><strong>55am \u2013</strong><strong> </strong>There are 846 Californians in our four-story hotel at Travis air force base. The majority are elderly folks, many using canes, walkers, wheelchairs and scooters. Medical staff takes our temperatures twice a day. We asked again to be tested for Covid-19 and learned this morning from a medical staff person that they do not have test kits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5eb3897c919b58ba81d22509b1868094630fcca8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5eb3897c919b58ba81d22509b1868094630fcca8/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Morse\u2019s room at the Westwind Inn hotel on Travis air force base in Fairfield, California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Morse\u2019s room at the Westwind Inn hotel on Travis air force base in Fairfield, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David and Denise Morse/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is likely that there are folks among us with the virus. We are advised to wash hands, wear our masks, stay six feet from others, and not gather in large groups. However, we have large groups standing close to each other in line to pick up their food boxes. We\u2019ve seen people pick up a box, look at it, then choose another box.</p> <p>We skipped coffee this morning because to get coffee you have to stand in a line, then use your bare hands to separate a cup from a stack of cups and dispense coffee from a community container. I asked a medical staff person why not have staff dispense the coffee, noting they all have gloves. She said there is not enough staff.</p> <p>I feel that each day we stay here we increase our chances of contracting the virus. Denise and I are doing our best to protect ourselves and stay positive. We are healthy and know that we will do well if we get the virus. We don\u2019t take the elevators; we try to stay away from groups of people. We exercise. I do tai chi every day and Denise meditates every day.</p> <p><strong>Denise, 2pm \u2013</strong><strong> </strong>I spent much of yesterday and today talking to political folks about the conditions here, calling the offices of California senators Diane Feinstein and Kamala Harris and congressman John Garamendi.</p> <p>We were feeling rather discouraged about the health and safety situation. But things are improving. At noon they started delivering our meals to our rooms.</p> <p><strong>David, 3</strong><strong>.40</strong><strong>pm \u2013</strong> What a day. Another passenger and I were outside playing Five Foot Two on the ukuleles we got on the cruise ship. A military guy politely approached us and said: \u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt, but I have orders to ask you to return to your room.\u201d I don\u2019t know why. Off to our room.</p> <p>There is no alcohol allowed here. But we have a few small bottles from the ship. Just had Jack and coke, made Denise a gin and tonic without ice or limes.</p> <h2><strong>13 March</strong></h2> <p><strong>David, 9</strong><strong>.02</strong><strong>am \u2013</strong><em> </em>We are getting acquainted with how things work here. Yesterday at the reception area in the lobby I asked a friendly service woman if we could have some shampoo. She said, \u201cYou know, soap is fine.\u201d I said \u201cOK, could we have some soap?\u201d She said, \u201cSorry, we are out of soap.\u201d Later I asked another staff member for some soap. She gave me a small bottle of shampoo.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f263270a7186bbcdc6ec54ae16ead077a2ed33db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f263270a7186bbcdc6ec54ae16ead077a2ed33db/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The view from the Morse\u2019s fourth-floor room at the Westwind Inn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The view from the Morses\u2019 fourth-floor room at the Westwind Inn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David and Denise Morse/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This morning, after complimenting the staff on how they are now dispensing the box meals to our rooms, I complained that coffee is still grab and go, as are juice, water, cream and sugar.</p> <p>A few minutes later a staff member knocked at our door and said the commander of the quarantine operation would like to talk to me. Denise and I thought, \u201cOh no, now we are in trouble.\u201d We met Nate Contreras, who informed us that he is in charge of 60 staff, who serve food, deliver medications, take our temperatures and respond to any passenger\u2019s medical issue. He was friendly and wanted to hear our concerns. He explained that he didn\u2019t have enough staff to dispense coffee, but he has asked for more.</p> <p>We asked for more hand-washing stations, signs and hand sanitizer. The only place we can wash our hands is in our rooms. We suggested they give us packets for the coffee makers we have in our rooms, he said he would look into it. Surprise: we were not in trouble.</p> <p><strong>Denise, 9</strong><strong>am \u2013</strong><strong> </strong>We got our first official Travis air force base newsletter today. Here\u2019s what they said about testing: <em>Everyone here will have the opportunity to be tested for Covid-19. You are not required to be tested. It will be your choice. If you choose to be tested, it is important that you understand that if the results of your test are pending, then it is possible it may delay your departure.</em></p> <p><strong>David, 10</strong><strong>.30</strong><strong>am</strong> \u2013 23 March is the first day of spring and supposedly the end of our 14-day quarantine. We have nine days to go; this testing statement sounds like it is a feeble attempt to be able to claim that passengers were offered the opportunity to be tested. What would you do?</p> <p>Here is our list of needs: a blanket (we have a one-sheet cover on our bed and it\u2019s cold in here), coffee, replacement light bulb for the light on our bed stand, hand soap and laundry detergent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"67eacf75bee1aa6be3d75ecdfc619061429d0c68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67eacf75bee1aa6be3d75ecdfc619061429d0c68/0_44_720_900/400.jpg\" alt=\"Denise Morse out for a walk on the grounds of Westwind Inn.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Denise Morse out for a walk on the grounds of Westwind Inn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David and Denise Morse/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>14 March</strong></h2> <p><strong>David, 8.</strong><strong>03</strong><strong>am \u2013</strong> Denise and I are healthy and in good spirits. We got another newsletter today. It repeats the same testing instructions we saw yesterday, which seem like a threat rather than an option to be tested.</p> <p>We walked in the rain this morning. We have to walk on the lawn, as most of the sidewalks are outside the perimeter fence that surrounds the complex \u2013 with security guards in SUVs watching 24/7.</p> <h2><strong>16 March</strong></h2> <p><strong>Denise, 9</strong><strong>.30</strong><strong>am \u2013</strong><strong> </strong>Woke up at 6am. While David was doing the laundry down the hall, I made the bed and cleaned the bathroom with the hand sanitizer cloths that we had brought with us on the cruise ship. They are gold, and we only use them to clean surfaces in our room and bathroom. There are no cleaning supplies. We were told we could have a room cleaning, but we prefer to not have anyone in our room.</p> <p>We have decided not to be tested. Our rationale is we are in good health and show no symptoms. As required, we wear our masks when out of our room, stay six feet from individuals, don\u2019t touch handles. We take stairs and wash our hands for 20 seconds when we return to our room.</p> <h2><strong>15 March</strong></h2> <p><strong>Denise, 9</strong><strong>.31</strong><strong>am \u2013</strong><strong> </strong>Up at 7am. Our floor medical person took our temp at 8.30 \u2013 normal. We have acquired some coffee, so David made coffee in our room. Breakfast was lighter this morning: bagel, cream cheese, banana, option for yogurt and a ketchup pack (what for?).</p> <p>The daily<strong> </strong>2pm conference call with federal officials from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) left us confused and worried. They announced there have been two confirmed cases among passengers assigned to this facility. They said those with close contact with those individuals have been informed; no need to be concerned. They have begun testing those who asked to be tested \u2013 only 30% of those at Travis ended up wanting a test. Those who got tested are still waiting for results.</p> <p>Dinner served at 6.40pm included a hamburger bun with a piece of yellow cheese, sliced tomato and a piece of lettuce. I asked if there was anything else and the man who delivered it said no. So we used the microwave in our room to heat up the bun and cheese. Wasn\u2019t that bad, but it was not many calories. Twenty minutes later, there was a knock on the door and we were given two more boxes with a bare hamburger patty and fries. Too bad we had already eaten the cheese and bun.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2a2b21f4336daa0e67c137aea7d9d4983df2cb8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2a2b21f4336daa0e67c137aea7d9d4983df2cb8/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A meal served at Travis air force base.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A meal served at Travis air force base.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David and Denise Morse/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>17 March</strong></h2> <p><strong>Denise, 9</strong><strong>.30</strong><strong>am \u2013</strong><strong> </strong>We don\u2019t have a table for eating. We tried using the luggage rack with a towel on it but that proved to be too unstable. Now David eats at the desk and I sit on a leather chair and balance the container on my lap.</p> <p>We get many emails and texts. We find we need to take breaks from our telephones and from hearing about this pandemic.</p> <p>At the daily conference call, the doctor gave us more details about the two confirmed cases.<strong> </strong>One person was identified as having the virus while disembarking from the ship and was not brought to Travis. The other case was a couple that had mobility issues and one tested positive. They were not on the base long and were in their room, so exposure was minimal to others, the staff told us. A total of 37 confirmed cases as of today from the Grand Princess.</p> <p>When they brought our dinner, David put on some soothing classical music. We wish we had some wine.</p> <p>I want to say this staff has taken a lot of flak from many of us, me included. They have listened, and in most cases, followed up. I have seen changes and an almost daily effort and improvement, specifically around food and drink.</p> <p>At 8pm, we got a call from the front desk and we have two packages! It\u2019s like Christmas! David went down and just came up with two Amazon boxes. One box is from our son Jonathan: a large bag of M&amp;M\u2019s. The other box is from my sister: dental floss and body lotion. We\u2019re happy with these new items to add to our simple supply of \u201cextras\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>20 March</strong></h2> <p><strong>Denise, 5 pm \u2013 </strong>Bad news today. More people at Travis have tested positive. If they didn\u2019t get it on the ship, they probably may have gotten it here. The conditions the first few days were appalling.</p> <p><em>On 20 March, HHS confirmed that, with new test results still coming in, eight people at Travis had tested positive. Four of them were hospitalized with complications of Covid-19. One person was hospitalized for other reasons.</em></p> <p><em>\u201cEveryone that requested to be tested was tested,\u201d an HHS spokesperson said. \u201cThe government cannot force an asymptomatic person to be tested.\u201d</em></p> <p><em>In a statement, the department also emphasized that it is working to improve conditions for the Grand Princess passengers under quarantine.</em></p> <p><em>\u201cThis unprecedented response has presented significant logistical challenges that have affected passengers. During the first two days of this massive undertaking, HHS focused on screening passengers for symptoms, addressing any underlying health conditions, providing access to prescription medication, and getting passengers settled into their rooms. At each step of the way, plans and policies were adapted as necessary to accommodate specific problems at hand.\u201d</em></p> <p><em>\u201cThis is the first federal quarantine in nearly </em><em>60 years. HHS\u2019s number one priority is the health of the passengers, the people caring for them, and those in the surrounding communities. We continue to focus on hospitality issues, such as food service and housekeeping, to improve the comfort of our guests.\u201d</em></p>",

  "<p>I\u2019m in two groups that have sprung up spontaneously online, for neighbours to help each other out: one on Facebook, the other on WhatsApp. Neither is remotely political, in the sense that nobody is discussing the government or its deficiencies. And you would never distinguish between the two in terms of generosity or creativity: there are mental health nurses offering Skype calls, people offering parking spaces and dog walking. And above all, and always, support for self-isolation: any shopping, any errands, anything at all, to maintain this state of confinement that only a fortnight ago would have felt impossible, and still feels so unnatural.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/22/facebook-powerful-crisis-coronavirus-communities-online\">Facebook is still far too powerful.

The ward immediately split into subgroups of two or three streets, and the leafleting began.</p> <p>This is what you always remember from a Labour childhood, the endless leafleting, the crushing sense of futility at popping another 300 flyers telling people how seriously your candidate takes buses. In a time of crisis, it is transformed: you don\u2019t want to create an online community of people who all use the same social networks. You want to tell everybody. There is a huge amount of embedded knowledge about the process of activism, how to get round an estate where there\u2019s an entry code, what phrases to use in the leaflet, how big the font should be. All guardedness is jettisoned, with people freely giving out their numbers and addresses to strangers.</p> <p>There is a lot of regular, worldly expertise \u2013 a nurse, a shrink and a vet on one scabby road \u2013 who can scotch operational rumours that circulate quite freely on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/07/facebook-mask-ad-ban-coronavirus\">Facebook</a> (\u201cwear gloves\u201d, the round robins say; but gloves are the same as hands, in hygiene terms. And at least hands, you can wash). You could predict from miles away that there would be a lot of local knowledge, but it is still so surprising in its particulars \u2013 there\u2019s a nunnery in the road perpendicular to mine, which everyone has always known, because of the nuns. But it was the activists who knew that it was also a hospice, housing 176 terminally ill people, and it was that tiny local support group that started putting together a rota for checking what they need. Not every member knows every other in a Labour ward, but there\u2019s one person who everybody knows, and she (it\u2019s always a she) carries a lot of weight, maybe because she doesn\u2019t swing it. She can shoot down a misjudged idea with an emoji. In this group of very mild, sometimes online-only acquaintanceship, there is a huge amount of love.</p> <p>Hoaxes and hysteria are the condiments of any emergency: presumably there\u2019s malice in their creation, which is depressing, but I understand why people believe and spread them. We are in this insistently eerie state of constantly checking the news, only to find it hasn\u2019t changed, except to worsen. This puts us all in a passive, suspended state. If you can find movement in events, you can think yourself ahead of them. Hence this slew of rumours: the army\u2019s on the streets, the shops are running out of food, this guy knows a guy who works in RBS, and he says national quarantine by 5pm, my friend who\u2019s a nurse says don\u2019t drink anything with ice in it, and hold your breath while counting to 10. They spread pretty much unchecked on open forums, but are shot down with precision in tighter groups.</p> <p>It is not relevant what the politics are of this ground army; it could be any group, the Women\u2019s Institute, the RNIB. What is relevant is that the ground army exists, and is confronted with a challenge it is uniquely placed to meet. The moral act would be for all Labour leadership candidates to come out and say: the election will go ahead, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/14/labour-party-ballot-papers-complaints-leadership-election\">it\u2019s all online</a>, but the campaign is over. You all know who you\u2019re voting for. Redeploy the phone-bankers to talk about other things; cross-pollinate ideas; show solidarity; think about more organised ways to support the frontline workers and people who are isolated; shoot the breeze. The membership base has been the site of deep connections, knowledge and trust for many decades, counterpoised always by the amount of energy it spent talking about, and finding differences within itself. Members have already relinquished that second pastime entirely, and the leadership candidates should do the same.</p> <p>We already know, I think, that we\u2019re not going back to who we were before: a nation that could wind itself up into bitter hatreds over flimsy concepts, that took \u201cpragmatism\u201d to mean economic constraint over human generosity.</p> <p>\u201cConcentrate on the future\u201d is what people say <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/france-at-war-how-parisians-are-coping-with-life-under-lockdown\">under lockdown</a>, in France, in Italy, when pressed for advice on how to stay sane.

In the immediate term, the answer is very obvious, counterintuitive and painful: it\u2019s to stay the hell apart.</p> <p>In the longer term, the question is more searching. What can we build, together, to keep each other safe, not just from disease, but from want, from despair, from solitude? These questions, I think, will collapse old party divisions. After this brutal lesson in what matters, we will have a keen eye afterwards for what doesn\u2019t. Labour can model that now \u2013 given that it just isn\u2019t possible to cooperate and compete simultaneously, it must choose cooperation.

We have no shortages other than people buying anywhere from three to five times [more].\u201d</p> <p>People don\u2019t appear to have listened. There are still many spaces on supermarket shelves where bathroom tissue and milk should be.</p> <p>So what, exactly, is going on?</p> <p>Annelies Goger, a fellow with the Brookings Institution specializing in workforce and safety net programs, said that a widespread shift to work-from-home mandates played a role. Because people were working outside the home, they dined at more restaurants. Some companies provided meals to their employees. More than 50% of food expenditures were consumed away from home, Goger noted.</p> <p>\u201cNow, all those people are working from home and most of them are making food, and buying it at a grocery store, instead of going out,\u201d Goger said. \u201cOvernight, the channels whereby people are getting food are just completely changing.\u201d</p> <p>Daniel Stanton, who wrote Supply Chain Management for Dummies, said that recently hard-to-come-by staples are still around. The present distribution model isn\u2019t aligned with the new buying behavior. People are buying more staples, but they\u2019re not actually using more \u2013 what he described as \u201cphantom demand\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe manufacturers are probably working overtime, three shifts, to produce toilet paper,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a couple of weeks, all that toilet paper is going to end up at the stores, and nobody is going to have to buy toilet paper, because everybody\u2019s stocked up.</p> <p>\u201cReally, I can assure you, the supply chains, they\u2019re working fine,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem is, there are these delays. Over the course of the next couple of weeks, the aisles are going to be clogged with toilet paper.\u201d</p> <p>Stanton did say that the supply chain needed to shift to meet real demands of other items \u2013 that is, demands for products that people will actually use \u2013 such as medical masks and soaps.</p> <p>He also thought that the social distancing inherent in two key parts of the food supply chain, agriculture and distribution, mitigates many workers\u2019 coronavirus risk. However, he said, \u201cThere are infrastructure pieces that we need to have in place to help those industries continue.\u201d</p> <p>Stanton pointed to Pennsylvania transportation officials\u2019 closure of rest stops along the highway \u2013 which truckers rely on for breaks, naps and restroom access. Following <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/health/coronavirus/penndot-trucks-cornoavirus-rest-stop-ban-20200318.html\">outcry</a>, authorities there reportedly reopened 17 of 46 such stops.</p> <p>\u201cWe absolutely need to be looking at what are the sectors, what are the infrastructures, that we need to protect and maintain, so that trucks, especially, can continue moving,\u201d he said, noting \u201cIt\u2019s also true for rail freight.\u201d</p> <p>Similarly, shutting down port terminals because of a positive coronavirus test, as <a href=\"https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/coronavirus-houston-texas-cases-covid-19-live-blog-15142519.php\">happened</a> in Houston, Texas, has risks. Shutting down migration across the US-Mexico border could deal a huge blow to agricultural production, he said.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re running out of food,\u201d said Hannah Kain, president and CEO of supply chain firm Alom. \u201cPeople want to be safe, and they do more storage at home, so we have all these filled freezers, etc.</p> <p>\u201cThat being said, there\u2019s a lot of, it\u2019s getting harder to move things around and move over borders,\u201d Kain said.</p> <p>Most air cargo, she said, is transported in passenger planes. Because commercial airlines cut flights, cargo prices have gone up.</p> <p>Maybe, under the most dire circumstances, \u201cwe could be in a world where transportation and production of food could be more restrained\u201d, but that is a big step away from the food uncertainty one sees in the developing world, she said.</p> <p>So, while shoppers might not see as many plums shipped from Chile, there will still be produce to eat.</p> <p>\u201cI think you can still get celery in most places, or carrots,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have been very privileged the past 10, 15 years in being able to transport food from wherever it was at the peak, to where it was not so much at the peak.\u201d</p>",

Like in Stuart\u2019s case, <a href=\"https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/sites/default/files/Publicly%20Reported%20MPP%20Attacks%20-%2028%20Feb%202020.pdf\">police were often the perpetrators</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThere are a lot of people who are sick in MPP, a lot of people who have kids or parents that have medical vulnerabilities already because they\u2019ve been in Mexico, and homeless, and living in tent camps or crowded shelters for a really long time,\u201d said Christina Brown, a Denver-based immigration attorney.</p> <p>Yet even as the coronavirus spread across the US, migrants still amassed in large groups, were transported next to one another in vans and filed into US immigration courts, their attorneys said.</p> <p>When Brown started experiencing the virus\u2019s symptoms last week and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6808342-Motion-to-Continue.html\">tried to postpone</a> her client\u2019s court date so she wouldn\u2019t potentially infect government workers and vulnerable migrants, it took multiple calls and an email from her or her paralegal just to get permission to file an emergency continuance over the web, instead of in-person.</p> <p>A judge eventually granted her motion, but Brown balked at the fact that it was a matter of discretion.</p> <p>In California, Robyn Barnard, a staff attorney with Human Rights First, asked her clients who came through the San Ysidro port of entry for their asylum hearing whether they were given additional screenings for health conditions or coronavirus symptoms. They told her they were asked by US officials for their names and if the women were pregnant or on their periods, but nothing more. The family packed into a court waiting room, where there weren\u2019t even enough chairs for everyone to sit.</p> <p>As immigration judges, government attorneys and immigration attorneys collectively sounded the alarm that continued operations at immigration courts could threaten public health, the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), which adjudicates immigration cases, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/19/us-immigration-courts-open-coronavirus-risks\">slowly reacted</a>.</p> <p>But even after EOIR closed some courts and postponed hearings for immigrants not in government custody, the MPP hearings continued. Meanwhile, Kim Hunter, a border rights fellow for Project Corazon who until recently worked in Matamoros, saw only a handful of people wearing masks.</p> <p>Not until Friday did MPP hearings cancel for the day, and confusion abounded as to when and how they would be rescheduled. Migrants who showed up at ports of entry were turned away, attorneys said; some were told to return the following day so they could be assigned a court date. The change in policy coincided with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/mar/20/coronavirus-us-donald-trump-response-republicans-stock-scandal-live-updates\">the Trump administration\u2019s announcement</a> that it was closing the US-Mexico border to all non-essential travel.</p> <p>Hunter listed off clients who are currently in Mexico and fit the profiles of coronavirus\u2019s most at-risk victims \u2013 a girl with a life expectancy of 10, whose particular syndrome kills those affected when they breathe; a client with cardiomyopathy; a nearly 70-year-old living in a tent in one of the camps.</p> <p>But it\u2019s going to be difficult to get any of them into the US now, said Charlene D\u2019Cruz, one of Hunter\u2019s colleagues at Project Corazon. To even try, she thought she would have to somehow go to Mexico and risk the spread of disease. Even then, the likelihood her clients would actually be removed from MPP and allowed into the US was still low, in her view.</p> <p>Erika Pinheiro, litigation director at Al Otro Lado, warned she fears that mass deaths will follow once the virus reaches the crowded spaces where migrants in Mexico find refuge. Already, attorneys said they constantly hear everyone staying in shelters and camps walking around with a cough, a testament to how quickly respiratory issues spread in such close quarters.</p> <p>\u201cOnce it hits the camp, it will spread like wildfire,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt in my mind.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Though Africa has <a href=\"https://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus-covid-19#sitrep\">fewer coronavirus cases</a> and a slower rate of infection than the UK, many countries in the continent have passed dramatically more extreme measures to prevent its spread than Britain has. In my birth country of Sudan, after only one case and one death was registered, all schools and universities were shut down. Several other nations, such as Egypt, have taken the ultimate precaution and closed their airports.</p> <p>There is no denial here, no mixed messaging, and no unfounded promise of how soon we will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/boris-johnson-uk-can-turn-tide-of-coronavirus-in-12-weeks\">send the virus packing</a>.</p> <p>The tough and timely action is borne less out of political maturity than it is bitter experience, and an awareness that already overburdened public healthcare systems cannot sustain an onslaught. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/25/-sp-ebola-crisis-briefing\">ebola epidemic of 2014</a> is still fresh in the mind in sub-Saharan African countries; it was an experience that showed prevention and containment are the only hope of fending off thousands of deaths.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is the recurring theme of how the pandemic has played out so far. The poor, the uninsured, the disenfranchised, the information-poor and the less mobile are sitting ducks</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If we are concerned about the failure to contain the virus in western Europe and the US, multiples of that horror await in the developing world. With few means of medical intervention, and several other risk factors such as malnutrition, high population densities, communal living and lack of access to water and washing facilities, the rates of mortality could dwarf what has been seen so far in the west. And economically, the virus risks ushering in an ice age. There are no war chests, no stimulus packages, no insurance payouts.</p> <p>There is little data about the impact in Africa of previous pandemics such as the 1918-19 Spanish flu (except from South Africa where, because of troop movements, <a href=\"https://qz.com/africa/1818699/south-africa-bungled-spanish-flu-lessons-are-still-relevant/\">6% of the population perished</a>). But we do have the experience of economically similar south Asian countries to go by. It is estimated that up to 30% of the entire fatal toll of the Spanish flu came from a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-51904019\">single country, India</a>. And in Africa it appears that the countries that suffered the highest casualties were those most exposed to global flows of people and capital \u2013 the ports or thoroughfares for troops on the move, and for sea and land labour.</p> <p>There is something painfully predictable about how coronavirus was introduced to the continent. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-safrica/south-africa-confirms-first-case-of-coronavirus-idUSKBN20S1ID\">Well-off travellers</a> to the rest of the world returned from holidays and business trips carrying the virus, as did infected tourists.

The poor, the uninsured, the disenfranchised, the information-poor and the less mobile are sitting ducks. Many western economies, including the US and the UK, have slowly pushed these people to the margins, while restricting employment benefits such as holiday pay, sick leave, and private insurance to an increasingly exclusive class. One of the reasons the British and US governments have been so slow to provide free testing, medical care and bailouts for those who\u2019ve lost work is that these inequalities are now hardwired into the system. They cannot be undone overnight even when lives depend on it.</p> <p>The global economy is set up in much the same way, with winners who hoard the spoils, and losers who scratch around for the leftovers. If wealthy single countries cannot scramble to save their own people, there is no hope for any effort to extend help to countries with a fraction of the resources.</p> <p>But here is the tragic catch for those who think that this structural imbalance is not our problem. In this instance, national and international inequalities cannot persist without everyone losing. The realisation is just beginning to dawn upon lawmakers that the rich cannot be barricaded against the poor, no matter how high the barriers to the fortress are. Limiting the spread of the virus entails ensuring that everyone in the pool, be it local or global, is given the ability to test, self-isolate if need be, and receive treatment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/22/coronavirus-exposes-society-fragility-find-solutions-that-will-endure\">Coronavirus exposes society\u2019s fragility.

S\u00e1nchez said on Sunday that he would seek to extend the emergency measures until 11 April. </p> <p>He also announced additional measures, including a 30-day restriction on travellers arriving from non-EU countries, save for those on essential travel. As well, regional governments will be given the power to take control of private care homes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-spain-takes-over-private-healthcare-amid-more-european-lockdowns\">amid concerns that the unchecked spread</a> of the virus in care facilities could be linked to the deaths of at least 100 people. </p> <p>While the country struggles to contain the virus, many worry about the economic impact it will have on a country where the unemployment rate already ranks among the highest in the industrialised world. </p> <p>Praising the EU\u2019s response to the crisis so far, S\u00e1nchez called for an EU-wide plan aimed at reinvigorating the economies of member states. \u201cWe need to articulate a grand Marshall Plan of reconstruction,\u201d he said. </p> <p> \u201cEurope is at war against the coronavirus.

In a televised address - his third in less than a week - Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the measure will prohibit \u201cthe circulation and movement of citizens\u201d deemed to be \u201cpurposeless\u201d - the strictest restriction, yet, in the fight to contain the novel coronavirus spreading further. </p> <p>\u201cIt is perhaps the last step that an organised democratic state [can take],\u201d he said. \u201c A step which must be taken in time, so that it is not taken in vain, because time isn\u2019t counted, any more, in days but in hours,\u201d he told the nation adding that in Italy, every two minutes, a life was now being lost to Covid-19. </p> <p>Exceptions to the rule would be made for citizens going to and from work; for the provision of food and medicine; for visits to a doctor and for those who needed care; for those exercising individually, or with one other person, and for people walking dogs. Those travelling to their permanent place of residence would also be exempt from the measure. </p> <p>But once enforced anyone out on the streets would have to have their passports or identity cards with them at all times, the centre right leader said insisting that the full force of the law would be imposed on those who violated the restriction. Fines of 150 euro will be given in the case of infractions. </p> <p>Although Greece has managed to contain the spread of Covid-19 infections, numbers are going up and privately officials say they expect a big leap in the coming days. On Sunday, health authorities announced that in the past 24 hours there had been 94 new cases of people testing positive for the virus with a total of 624 confirmed coronavirus cases countrywide. To date, 15 people have died from the disease (with the exception of three, all men). Altogether 124 have been hospitalised with 34 requiring intensive care - double the figure over that released yesterday. Most of those who have contracted the virus are in Athens. The average age of those hospitalised is 64. <br><br>Greece was among the first EU member states to announce draconian measures to stem the virus, starting with the closure of schools on March 10, followed by the shutting of nightclubs, gyms, cinemas and theatres two days later and cafes, restaurants, bars and shopping malls on March 13. All retail shops were ordered closed on March 18. In his address, Mitsotakis thanked the vast majority of Greeks for upholding the restrictions, chastising the \u201cfrivolous few [who] undermine the safety of most.\u201d </p> <p>Greeks could be seen in droves converging on beaches on Saturday to enjoy the warm weather. A mass exodus of residents from Athens and other urban centres to villages in the countryside has also alarmed authorities who fear transmission rates spreading to remote areas nationwide. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-22T17:58:13.354Z\">at 5.58pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e779cd58f08a08573fbf623\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-22T17:15:03.890Z\">5.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Our UK focussed coronavirus blog is reporting on Boris Johnson\u2019s daily press conference which is currently happening.

Speaking on the occasion of the New Year and Eid al-Mab\u2019ath, the 80-year-old said \u201cyou Americans are accused of engineering coronavirus\u201d, adding: \u201cI do not know how true this claim is, but as long as the accusation stands, which sensible person would trust you to accept your offer of help.</p> <p>\u201cPossibly your (offered) medicine is a way to spread the virus more,\u201d he said. \u201cOr if you send therapists and doctors, maybe so they want to see the effect of the poison in Iranian society, so they can complete their information. It is said that part of the virus was produced against the Iranian people.\u201d</p> <p>His tone contradicted that of the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, who had the day before sent a heartfelt plea to the American public to set aside their differences with Iran and work together to fight the virus, including by the US suspending economic sanctions on Iran.</p> <p>The supreme leader was immediately challenged by Iranian reformist politicians such as Mahmoud Sadeghi to produce evidence to back his claim.</p> <p>Khamenei\u2019s controversial belief in an American biological conspiracy came as the Iranian health ministry said the new infections in Iran in the past 24 hours had reached 1,865, with a further 129 deaths. The official figures show the number of deaths by day stabilising.</p> <p>The total number of infected people had reached 21,638. The health ministry spokesman said 7,913 people had recovered.</p> <p>The official figures have been widely challenged on the basis that the recording of the number of deaths includes only those who died after being tested for the disease. The World Health Organization has said the figure may be only a fifth of the true number who have died. The official death toll shows no obvious pattern since for the last three days it has risen only from 220 to 240, yet the infections are rising.</p> <p>Iran also continued to send out contradictory messages about whether it could overcome the virus without sanctions being lifted. The letter from the president underlined the need for US sanctions being lifted. Khamenei has insisted the country can survive independently.</p> <p>The US state department hit back at claims it was preventing medicines reaching Iran, saying: \u201cDear Iranians, as your government will not tell you the truth, we say: on March 2, Iran, which instead of acting like any normal government around the world, refuses to make your economic system transparent. The reason the regime is hiding its economy is because it is corrupt.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In Tehran province the deputy mayor, Hamid Reza Goudarzi, after weeks of controversy has announced that all shops but essential food shops and pharmacies must close, and those that refuse to abide by the instructions will be punished.</p> <p>The International Monetary Fund has still not responded to an Iranian request for a $5bn loan to help fight the virus.</p> <p>Qom News, an agency covering Qom, one of the centres of the disease, reported on Sunday: \u201cIn every house black cloth hangs from the walls of houses and the sound of crying in mourning houses resounds.

After the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/spain-city-streets-turn-quiet-coronavirus-lockdown-madrid-barcelona\">first full week of near-total lockdown</a>, the country\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, reportedly told regional leaders he would aim to get parliamentary approval to extend the emergency measures for another 15 days. </p> <p>The extension comes after S\u00e1nchez warned that the toughest days of the crisis still lie ahead. <br></p> <p> \u201cUnfortunately, the worst is to come,\u201d Pedro S\u00e1nchez said on Saturday. \u201cWe have yet to feel the impact of the hardest, most damaging wave, one that will test the limits of our moral and material capacity, as well as our spirit as a society.\u201d </p> <p>A cacophony of sound preceded his address to the nation, as some banged pots and pans to show their dissatisfaction with how his government has managed the crisis. </p> <p>Healthcare workers on the frontlines have described a healthcare system pushed to the brink, with intensive care patients outstripping capacity in some hospitals and workers forced to use garbage bags as hospital gowns amid a shortage of protective gear. \u201cWe\u2019re at war,\u201d one doctor at Madrid\u2019s La Paz Hospital told the Guardian. </p> <p>The government said it had distributed more than million masks and was working on a plan to domestically produce protective gear. As the call for expanded testing grows, S\u00e1nchez said the government had acquired more than 640,000 tests and had already begun handing them out. </p> <p>On Sunday, paramedics in Madrid began transferring patients to a field hospital set up in Madrid\u2019s main exhibition hall, in a bid to relieve pressure on the city\u2019s most overwhelmed hospitals.

  "<p>Approximately a million undocumented migrants living under the radar in the UK could be at risk not only of contracting Covid-19 but also of starvation because of the crisis created by the pandemic, charities have warned.</p> <p>Nobody knows exactly how many of these migrants are currently in the UK, as the Home Office does not have comprehensive records of their whereabouts. This group includes asylum seekers whose claims the Home Office has rejected but who are fearful of returning to their home countries and temporary workers whose visas have expired.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-50420307\">report</a> published in November 2019 by the Pew Research Center, a Washington thinktank, estimates that there could be between 800,000 and 1.2 million of these migrants currently in the UK.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/21/home-office-releases-300-from-detention-centres-amid-covid-19-pandemic\">Home Office releases 300 from detention centres amid Covid-19 pandemic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Asylum seekers with an active claim receive <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/asylum-support/what-youll-get\">meagre support</a> from the Home Office \u2013 \u00a337.75 per week \u2013 to buy food and other essentials and no-choice accommodation. However, the vast majority of those whose cases have been refused receive no support at all.</p> <p>They are not allowed to work and survive thanks to a network of charities who provide survival packages of cooked meals at day centres, food parcels, secondhand clothing and supermarket vouchers. However, these charities have closed their day centres because of the pandemic.</p> <p>Mohammed, 30, was refused asylum despite coming from Eritrea, where the Home Office will not send people back to. He is based in London and says he is \u201cdesperate and struggling to survive\u201d during the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cEvery place where we got support is closed now. My friend gave me a bike because I have no money for bus fares. I\u2019m cycling round everywhere looking for food but can\u2019t find anything. If I can just find enough food to eat once a day, I think I will survive but I have not managed to find very much to eat.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried about coronavirus, I will accept whatever comes into my life with the virus. But I am worried that I will die from hunger.\u201d</p> <p>John, a 30-year-old from Cameroon who was refused asylum, lives in Manchester and said the virus had caused a lot of panic among migrants.</p> <p>\u201cAll of the charities and the churches where I used to go to get help with food and other support are shut down now. I was sleeping at Victoria or Piccadilly Stations but the charity <a href=\"http://www.rapar.org.uk/\">RAPAR</a> that I\u2019m a member of has found me some temporary accommodation. I can\u2019t return to my country because the military is killing people there. We are all in a state of trauma.\u201d</p> <p>RAPAR\u2019s chair of trustees, Dr Rhetta Moran is calling on the government to support undocumented, displaced and destitute people \u2013 those most vulnerable to Covid-19 \u2013 to come forward for safe housing without fear of being locked up.</p> <p>Haringey Migrant Support Service has created an <a href=\"https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/charity-web/charity/displayCharityCampaignPage.action?charityCampaignUrl=coronavirus\">emergency fund</a> for its homeless and destitute migrant visitors who they were previously supporting with food bank vouchers, food parcels and clothes. They were also providing lunch at their drop-in centres, which are not currently operating during the pandemic.</p> <p>Open letters from dozens of NGOs are currently circulating, calling on government to provide support for destitute migrants. The Public Interest Law Centre, Project 17, Migrants\u2019 Rights Network and others have produced an open letter to councils calling on them to establish Covid-19 homeless task forces for this group catering for such people.</p> <p>It is unclear whether an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/21/uk-hotels-homeless-shelters-coronavirus\">initiative</a> due to be announced on Monday to house homeless people in empty hotels will include destitute migrants or only British street homeless people. The latter have access to housing and other benefits, the former do not.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: \u201cNobody should find themselves starving in this crisis \u2013 and many charities will be supported through the measures the government has outlined to keep people employed.</p> <p>\u201cWe understand that this is a difficult time and we are continually reviewing the situation to consider what more can be done for those in the UK whose immigration status has been affected by coronavirus.\u201d</p>"
