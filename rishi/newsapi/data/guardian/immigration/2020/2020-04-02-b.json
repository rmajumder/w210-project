Coronavirus has turned etiquette on its head and what once were gestures of friendship are now acts of daring. Fundamentally, society used to run on the idea that we were all welcome in one another\u2019s space; suddenly, civility amounts to how much distance we keep between ourselves, and how much we shield others from our presence. It is one hell of a gear shift. And it is also important not to overcorrect, not to judge one another from a thousand yards, not to needlessly insult one another in situations that are not, actually, that endangering. Courtesy has never been more serious: it is the way we signal that we still care about each other, when we\u2019re not allowed to hug.

In an April that may be apocalyptically cruel, that is how we are poised, desiring spring.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ColumbiaSurgery/status/1245476381938630656\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">COVID-19 Update: Wednesday, 4/1/20<br><br>First day of April and here\u2019s the latest on the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19</a> crisis from Dr. Craig Smith: <a href=\"https://t.co/WivoATBLL6\">https://t.co/WivoATBLL6</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/vG9BrcUI7y\">pic.twitter.com/vG9BrcUI7y</a></p>\u2014 Columbia Surgery (@ColumbiaSurgery) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ColumbiaSurgery/status/1245476381938630656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 1, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8574be8f08532a0e666634\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/martinfarrer\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-02T05:30:24.428Z\">6.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Time for the UK front pages now. </p> \n  <p>The unfolding coronavirus testing fiasco dominates the major UK newspaper front pages after the daily death toll hit climbed to a new record and it emerged that only 2,000 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs\">NHS</a> staff had been tested.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/t_calverley/status/1245490079595986948\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Guardian midnight edition 2 April 2020: Just 2,000 frontline NHS staff out of half a million have been tested <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/theguardian?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#theguardian</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardian?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@guardian</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/BQpfXPfKmz\">pic.twitter.com/BQpfXPfKmz</a></p>\u2014 T Calverley (@t_calverley) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/t_calverley/status/1245490079595986948?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 1, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>\u201cShambles\u201d says the Mirror\u2019s headline alongside pictures of the latest two health workers to die from the disease \u2013 including retired doctor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/retired-hospital-medical-director-latest-to-die-from-covid-19-in-uk\">Alfa Saadu, 68,</a> who was volunteering at the Queen Victoria memorial hospital in Welwyn, Hertfordshire.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DailyMirror/status/1245457744959807496\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Tomorrow's front page: 'Coronavirus crisis shambles' <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TomorrowsPapersToday?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TomorrowsPapersToday</a><a href=\"https://t.co/fgLOUyu98P\">https://t.co/fgLOUyu98P</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Y4Avr8NuY9\">pic.twitter.com/Y4Avr8NuY9</a></p>\u2014 Daily Mirror (@DailyMirror) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DailyMirror/status/1245457744959807496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 1, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>The Mirror also has a picture of an empty drive-through testing station in Chessington, Surrey to emphasise its point \u2013 an image also used across the width of the Times\u2019 front page under the headline \u201cVirus testing plans in chaos\u201d.</p> \n  <p>The Mail focuses on the \u201cstatistic that humbles ministers\u201d with the headline \u201c550,000 NHS staff only 2,000 tested\u201d, in what it calls the \u201clatest shocking example of our testing scandal\u201d.

  "<p>Even at the best of times, I feel I need another programme following three men \u2013 especially Gobshite Clarkson, May and the wee one \u2013 on a trip to discover/sneer at foreign coastlines/cars/cultures like I need a hole in the head. The contrived scenarios. The forced banter. The woefully scripted links. The hilarious inclusion of bloopers that are neither hilarious nor, actually, bloopers. The pitifully fragile masculinity on display throughout.</p> <p>All of the above are of course present in the latest instalment of the Gordon, Gino and Fred franchise, Gordon, Gino and Fred: American Road Trip (ITV). For the avoidance of doubt, I should state that Gordon is Gordon Ramsay, of Gordon Ramsay fame, Gino is Gino d\u2019Acampo of \u201cbeginning his career as This Morning\u2019s chef and presenting several of his own cookery series since\u201d fame, and Fred is Fred Sirieix of First Dates fame. It is his conciliatory charm and ineffable grace that keep the two chefs from killing each other and provide balm to the soul of any viewer who would otherwise find the whole setup too pointlessly exhausting, especially in already emotionally draining times.</p> <p>The trio begin in Mexico, and start off drearily true to type. Gordon finds it smelly and dirty, and is grumpy. Gino is happy: \u201cThe dog shit is part of the experience!\u201d Fred is quiet and patient. They get on a coach and Gordon learns that the word \u201cavocado\u201d derives from the Mexican word for \u201ctesticle\u201d because avocados look like testicles. They go to a tequila bar in Tijuana. They drink tequila. Gordon finds a bottle with a literal rattlesnake literally pickled in it and decides it\u2019s time to find out who is \u201cBilly Big Bollocks or Billy Bullshit\u201d. It\u2019s practically all balls so far.</p> <p>Then it\u2019s cars for a bit. They get a big Jeep thing. Sorry \u2013 \u201cmammoth set of wheels\u201d known as \u201cBetty the Beast\u201d. They drive to a local market, and, with crushing inevitability, dare each other to eat the hottest chillies there.</p> <p>As the hour wears on, however, the stopped-clock-right-twice-a-day principle comes into play, and moments of humour and interest arise. The most fascinating, at least to those of us with enough miles on another clock and memories that are still just about managing to function in lockdown is the sight of what we might almost call the real, or at least the original screen version of, Gordon Ramsay. </p> <p>Once upon a time, children, long, long ago, Gordon was a respected Michelin-starred chef who achieved fame with a series called Ramsay\u2019s Kitchen Nightmares. And people and critics watched and called him horribly rude and aggressive. But, children, he was not. He was a respected, Michelin-starred chef who wanted idiots in charge of culinary establishments to raise their game and become competent in the field they had stupidly chosen; and so become viable business owners and happier people. At the beginning, he was a man trying to instil notions of quality and pride in people who were eight parts turnip to two parts sloth. Eventually, though, they and the people who insisted on seeing \u201chaving professional standards\u201d as the height of discourtesy broke him, and he became the raging bull we know and tire of today.</p> <p>The cold, clear fury with which he reacts to Gino\u2019s interpretation of ceviche and his genuine offence at his fellow chef\u2019s attitude (or ignorance, it matters not \u2013 Gordon is concerned with ends, not means) is a reminder of the good old days. As is his concentration when making a meal for all the employees at the La Cocina de Do\u00f1a Esthela in Valle de Guadalupe, whose machaca con huevos (shredded beef with scrambled eggs) holds the title of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/53q5mk/the-worlds-best-breakfast-is-in-a-small-village-in-northeast-mexico\">world\u2019s best breakfast</a>\u201d, and his compulsive insistence on everyone \u2013 especially sous chef Gino \u2013 getting it right. How you do anything is how you do everything; it\u2019s a credo only a few of us can live by and it must be \u2013 um \u2013 challenging to live with. But it\u2019s wonderful to watch. I wonder if he ever regrets letting the brand mask eat the professional face?</p> <p>The first episode ends with some painful \u2013 in every sense \u2013 nonsense involving local wrestlers. \u201cFuck this shit,\u201d says Gino after a few minutes. \u201cI\u2019m going to make guacamole.\u201d Words, overall, to live by.</p>",

  "<p>Europe is in the eye of the global storm over Covid-19. Four of the six countries with the most confirmed cases are <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\" title=\"\">in our continent</a>. The three with the most reported deaths are all in Europe too. Yet the European Union has often felt like a second-rank player, and some of its most important <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-europe-shock-tools-to-recover\" title=\"\">common principles</a> are being scattered to the winds. When <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_seven_early_lessons_from_the_coronavirus\" title=\"\">the pandemic</a> struck, it was nation states that stepped up, not the EU. Faced with a foe that ignores boundaries, the states of Europe <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-travel-restrictions.html\" title=\"\">closed their borders</a>. All focused on their own citizens. Citizens have reciprocated, looking overwhelmingly towards their own governments. Most have followed their governments\u2019 advice, not that of the EU. National leaders\u2019 public ratings have risen in many countries. In Europe\u2019s shared adversity, Europeans have become nation-statists once more.</p> <p>To a degree, this picture is misleading. It was <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-eu-prevention-excl-idUSKBN21J6FF\" title=\"\">the nation states</a> themselves that told the EU they had enough resources to combat the virus when it hit Europe. But the nation states were badly wrong; Britain has proved to be just the same. In January, the EU asked member states for details of the masks, tests and other supplies they might need, so that a common procurement plan could be initiated. Only four countries said they might have problems. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/no-10-boris-johnson-accused-of-putting-brexit-over-breathing-in-covid-19-ventilator-row\" title=\"\">Britain</a> stood aside for ideological reasons too. The EU\u2019s subsequent \u201cthings under control\u201d assessment was therefore wrong, because the states were wrong too. It is also true that several EU states have been cooperating vigorously. Germany, Austria and Luxembourg have opened their hospitals to Covid-19 victims from France, Spain and elsewhere. France and Germany have now donated more masks to Italy than were provided in the more widely publicised aid from Russia and China, but without the latter\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/china/news/serbia-sets-the-stage-for-beijings-mask-diplomacy/1450727/\" title=\"\">political dividend</a>.</p> <p>Nevertheless, by mid-March, as the EU closed its collective external border to the outside world, the union\u2019s common travel area collapsed, as a cascade of member states closed their national borders within Europe. Solidarity was again in short supply when the president of the European Central Bank, <a href=\"https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2020/03/12/1584027114000/A-dangerous-slip-up-from-Lagarde/\" title=\"\">Christine Lagarde</a>, fed the nation state mentality further by saying it was not the ECB\u2019s job to be each EU member state\u2019s borrower of last resort (she later retracted the comment). When France and eight other EU members demanded the setting up of a Europe-wide \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/25/nine-eu-countries-say-its-time-for-corona-bonds-as-virus-deaths-rise.html\" title=\"\">corona bond</a>\u201d debt instrument to help the worst-hit nations, a north-south divide deepened. Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Finland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/mar/31/solidarity-members-eurozone-coronavirus-dutch-coronabond\" title=\"\">said no</a>. Relations between Portugal and the Netherlands were stormy. Solidarity, in the eyes of Europe\u2019s \u201cfrugal four\u201d, now equates with moral hazard.</p> <p>When France and Germany, so often the driving force of an effective EU, pull in opposing directions, a faltering EU follows close behind. It feels significant that, when Italians go on their balconies to support their health workers, they sing Italy\u2019s national anthem, not the EU\u2019s Ode to Joy. Nor should it be any surprise that Europe\u2019s most celebrated integrationist, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/coronavirus-could-be-final-straw-for-eu-european-experts-warn\" title=\"\">Jacques Delors</a>, emerged from retirement in March to warn that the retreat from solidarity posed \u201ca mortal danger to the European Union\u201d. Mr Delors is right about that. Europe\u2019s centrifugal forces are becoming more powerful in the pandemic \u2013 and, for once, Brexit is not chiefly to blame. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/apr/01/coronavirus-contaminating-europe-democracy-viktor-orban-seize-more-power\" title=\"\">Hungary\u2019s</a> latest authoritarian shift is an act of contempt towards the EU\u2019s core principle that it is a union of democracies. <a href=\"https://www.cer.eu/insights/trouble-eu-brewing-coronavirus-hit-italy\" title=\"\">Italy\u2019s</a> terrible Covid-19 experience will, in due course, feed into the nation\u2019s already mounting EU scepticism. Just as individuals across Europe are isolating themselves from others, the same thing seems to be happening among Europe\u2019s nation states. Togetherness seems a long way off.</p>",
  "<p>In mid-March, shortly after the Navajo Nation declared a public health state of emergency, Ethel Branch went out to stock up on supplies for her elderly mother and nieces who live on the Native American reservation.</p> <p>Branch, who lives in Flagstaff, Arizona, spent all day going from store to store trying to find canned soups, soap and toilet paper. Many had sold out, while others were price gouging amid rising panic about the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>Branch started calling friends looking for ideas about how to ensure the tribe\u2019s most vulnerable families got enough food, water and hygiene supplies without risking their lives by traveling long distances.</p> <p>It was not easy. The Navajo Nation is the second-biggest tribal group in the US, with 332,000 people, according to the last census. But unemployment on the reservation hovers around 50% and it is also a food desert with only 13 grocery stores for 180,000 people. One in three people do not have running water or electricity.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d been monitoring developments [in Asia] since January, and knew when it hit us, it would be really bad so we had to get prepared,\u201d said Branch, 40, who served as the Nation\u2019s attorney general between 2015 and 2019.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3baa94ca989b065a23de7c3ffbc5eb38528fa637\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3baa94ca989b065a23de7c3ffbc5eb38528fa637/0_0_960_720/500.jpg\" alt=\"Shandiin Herrera, the relief fund\u2019s call centre coordinator and Utah team leader at the distribution centre in Monument Valley high school, Oljato, Utah.\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shandiin Herrera, the relief fund\u2019s call center coordinator and Utah team leader.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Navajo &amp; Hopi Families COVID-19 Relief Fund</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With these harsh realities in mind, Branch and her friends created the Navajo &amp; Hopi Families Covid-19 Relief Fund, and started a <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/NHFC19Relief\">GoFundMe</a> page.</p> <p>By Thursday, $267,000 had been donated and a small army of volunteers was coordinating a full-scale emergency response to distribute crucial supplies to needy families across the vast Navajo territory and the neighboring Hopi reservation, where three small convenience stores serve almost 3,000 people.</p> <p>So far, more than 2,000 households have registered for help \u2013 some<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/214813476301051/about/\"> online but most by calling</a> a call center volunteer who asks them about how much food they have left, allergies and medical needs, in order to prioritize orders.</p> <p>Hundreds of care packages \u2013 containing core items such as flour, beans, rice, canned soups, dried meat, fever and cough medicine, as well as fresh vegetables, fruit and meat when available, have been delivered to elders caring for grandchildren and people with pre-existing medical conditions.

The territory, which is roughly the size of West Virginia, includes arid deserts and alpine forests with high plateaus, mesas and mountains reaching over 10,000ft in altitude.</p> <p>In addition to economic and topographic challenges, the coronavirus pandemic represents particular risks to the Navajo \u2013 and other tribal nations \u2013 as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/20/coronavirus-outbreak-us-native-americans-health-services\">rates of cancer, heart and respiratory diseases and diabetes </a>are comparatively higher than in the non-Native populations, while tribal health services have been underfunded for decades.</p> <p>Amid growing concern, the Navajo government issued a <a href=\"https://navajotimes.com/reznews/covid-cases-now-at-29-people-not-heeding-stay-at-home-warning/\">shelter-in-place order</a> on 21 March \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/coronavirus-california-more-than-half-gavin-newsom\">two days after California</a> \u2013 shutting down all non-essential government services and businesses.</p> <p>\u201cThe order is to make sure we flatten the curve as soon as possible, and that means getting supplies to our most vulnerable residents and shelters so people stay home, and stay safe,\u201d said tribal council delegate Amber Kanazbah Crotty. \u201cWater is now our number one priority.\u201d</p> <p>Even before this crisis, access to water on the Navajo reservation was incredibly complicated.<a href=\"https://www.closethewatergap.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Dig-Deep_Closing-the-Water-Access-Gap-in-the-United-States_DIGITAL_compressed.pdf\"> At least 30% must rely on unregulated wells and springs</a> \u2013 which can be unsafe as many groundwater sources are contaminated by some 523 abandoned uranium mines \u2013 or travel up to 40 miles to replenish tanks and buy bottled water to meet basic needs like drinking, cooking and bathing.</p> <p>The limited access to clean, running water made following coronavirus prevention guidelines such as frequent hand-washing challenging. Now, many government water distribution points have closed, while others have cut their hours to comply with the stay-at-home order.</p> <p>Finding a reliable bulk water supplier is a priority for Branch\u2019s group as local stores and distributors expect shortages over coming weeks.</p> <p>The Navajo women driving this grassroots relief effort bring a range of business, public service and organizing experience, and include the owner of a home care company, a director of a not-for-profit small business incubator, and head of the department of corrections.</p> <p>These skills and contacts enabled them to make deals with wholesalers, and set up distribution points where volunteers sanitize items before trucking them to households in far-flung communities like Tuba City, Black Mesa and Hopi. The baskets are left on the doorstep, to minimize unnecessary physical contact.</p> <p>So far, 214 Covid-19 cases including seven deaths had been confirmed on the Nation.</p> <p>\u201cIt warms the heart,\u201d said longstanding tribal council delegate Daniel Tso. \u201cIt brings tears to my eyes to see people organizing and risking their own health to protect the elderly and vulnerable children, it really shows the strength of the Navajo people.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>A string of field hospitals is being rapidly built in south Wales as doctors prepare for an \u201conslaught\u201d of Covid-19 cases.</p> \n<p>The south-east of Wales has been the country\u2019s hotspot so far, with intensive care under such pressure that patients are being cared for in operating theatres.</p> \n<p>The number of Covid-19 cases in and around Cardiff is rising sharply and health chiefs are so concerned farther west in the Swansea Bay area that they are building two field hospitals there at a sports academy and a film studio complex.</p> \n<p>The chief executive of NHS Wales, Andrew Goodall, said on Thursday that an extra 6,000 beds were being prepared in Wales, in effect doubling the normal capacity.</p> \n<p>About 2,000 of these beds will be at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff, where the army is working. Another 1,300 will be set up at the two sites in Swansea Bay and 350 at a rugby stadium in Llanelli, south-west Wales. One 350-bed facility is being built in Llandudno, north Wales.</p> \n<p>Goodall said: \u201cWe expect the pressure on our healthcare system to be significant.

  "<h2>Stephen Colbert</h2> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s Wednesday,\u201d said Stephen Colbert on Wednesday\u2019s Late Show from his home in New Jersey. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell, because every day feels like you\u2019re being humped.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiXgBBA0wT0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FiXgBBA0wT0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>And \u201cwhile social distancing is working, we know the worst is yet to come,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cIt\u2019s like we saw the asteroid come in through the atmosphere and we know that it hit somewhere out in the ocean, and we\u2019re just waiting for the wave to come over the horizon. Well, I think the tide is rising.\u201d On Wednesday, the White House announced they project between 100,000 to 240,000 Americans will die of Covid-19. \u201cAnd with these devastating projections, it seems like President Trump now understands the gravity of the situation we\u2019re all in.\u201d As in, he called the coronavirus \u201cinteresting\u201d at his press conference and mused that people \u201ccan\u2019t get enough of it\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cYes, this pandemic which is crippling the global economy certainly is \u2026 interesting,\u201d said Colbert. \u201cIt reminds me of Winston Churchill: \u2018We shall fight them on the beaches, we shall fight them on the landing grounds. Why? Because it\u2019s interesting!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>One leader who is responding well to the crisis? New York\u2019s Governor Andrew Cuomo, who has \u201cprojected an air of much-needed competence during the epidemic,\u201d said Colbert, \u201cand the people. Are. There. For.

At Wednesday\u2019s press briefing, he struck what many news outlets called a \u201cdarker\u201d tone.</p> <p>\u201cGod damn, Donald Trump for the first time at least sounds like he\u2019s afraid of this virus,\u201d said Noah. \u201cAnd if he\u2019s taking it seriously, then we should be really scared. Because I mean, this guy takes nothing seriously. This is the same dude who stared at an eclipse like it was a magic eye painting. The same dude who sang Hakuna Matata when he assassinated an Iranian general. The same dude who responded to a hurricane with a paper towel three-point contest. So this is a side of Donald Trump we don\u2019t often get. I haven\u2019t seen Trump this somber since Maury told him that he was Eric\u2019s father.</p> <p>\u201cAnd if the president is finally treating the crisis with a little more respect, maybe it\u2019s because of the numbers,\u201d said Noah, referencing the chilling death range of 100,000-240,000 Americans released by the White House on Wednesday. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t care what anybody says, that is a staggering number,\u201d said Noah. \u201cEven in Call of Duty, if you saw that many deaths, you\u2019d be like, \u2018I think I\u2019ve been playing this game too much, I think I\u2019m going to switch to Animal Crossing for a while.\u201d</p> <h2>Samantha Bee</h2> <p>On Full Frontal, Samantha Bee focused on the pandemic\u2019s impact on American women. Many of the nation\u2019s most vulnerable frontline workers are women, Bee explained, especially nurses, and women are more likely to be low-wage or temporary workers who are the first to face layoffs when businesses shut down. Domestic workers, many of them undocumented immigrants who can\u2019t file for unemployment or stimulus relief, are mostly women and many are now out of work. \u201cAmerica: come for the low-paying jobs with no security, stay for the quarantines,\u201d Bee deadpanned.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_E7DlL3IS8I\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_E7DlL3IS8I?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Meanwhile, several states such as Tennessee, Mississippi, Iowa, Oklahoma, Alabama and Ohio have declared abortions \u201cnon-essential services\u201d and ordered clinics to shut down. \u201cSome of these restrictions are being challenged, but that can\u2019t happen quickly enough,\u201d said Bee.</p> <p>\u201cNow, if you\u2019re, say, a dude, and you can\u2019t quite empathize, let me put this in terms you might understand,\u201d Bee explained. \u201cImagine driving hours to see your favorite band \u2013 which, if you\u2019re a middle-aged white guy, I assume is Pearl Jam. It\u2019s the only chance you\u2019ll ever have to see Pearl Jam play live and if you don\u2019t get to see Pearl Jam play live now, your life will never be the same. But then when you finally get to the concert, Pearl Jam refuses to go on. You\u2019re devastated. And then Eddie Vedder forces you to have a baby.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea that any abortion isn\u2019t essential is medically irresponsible,\u201d Bee continued. \u201cNot having access to safe and legal abortion is scary, dangerous and can even be lethal. And for victims of domestic abuse, so is just staying at home.\u201d Isolation is essential for stopping the spread of Covid-19, said Bee, but for the 10 million Americans suffering from domestic abuse, it\u2019s a \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d, though support groups are going virtual, and there are hotlines available for help.</p> <p>Basically, \u201cCovid-19 hasn\u2019t made new problems for women, it\u2019s just exacerbated the old ones,\u201d said Bee. \u201cWe need to do a lot more for women during this crisis \u2013 starting with getting us all an emotional support Wilson,\u201d she said, referencing Tom Hanks\u2019s companion from Cast Away.</p>",
  "<p>The approval ratings of democratic leaders around the world have soared during the coronavirus crisis, but political scientists say it will not last \u2013 and warn that populist opposition parties, in particular, will bounce back strongly as it subsides.</p> <p>Will Jennings, a professor of political science at Southampton University, said the increases were due to an effect first identified in 1970 by a US political scientist, John Mueller, in a paper examining the popularity of US presidents in times of crisis.</p> <p>\u201cIn the context of the cold war, Mueller looked at presidential approval data dating back to the 1940s. He observed that it spiked significantly at major moments of tension like, say, the Cuban missile crisis,\u201d Jennings said.</p> <p>\u201cHe defined this \u2018rally round the flag\u2019 effect as coming from an international event that directly involved the president, and was \u2018dramatic, specific and sharply focused\u2019.

More recently, they have suggested it may be because politics and the media become less partisan, or when people feel threatened, they look to an authority figure to protect them.</p> <p>\u201cOne school believes that when partisan differences are set aside, and the media coverage becomes more unified \u2013 when the cues people are getting change \u2013 that creates a space for the leader to be viewed more positively,\u201d Jennings said. \u201cThe other explanation is more based on social psychology.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever it is that drives it, \u201crally round the flag\u201d generally has the effect of pushing opposition parties and their leaders \u2013 particularly those, such as western Europe\u2019s far-right populists, who habitually attack governments aggressively \u2013 out of the spotlight.</p> <p>France\u2019s Marine Le Pen, Italy\u2019s Matteo Salvini and the leaders of Germany\u2019s AfD have lost ground in the polls: Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Rally, is down three points <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elabe_fr/status/1245669569701830656\">according to the latest Elabe barometer</a>; Salvini\u2019s Lega has shed between two and four.

But we risk seeing a big resurgence.\u201d</p> <p>Europe could well see \u201can economic crisis after this health crisis \u2013 with a social crisis as a consequence\u201d, Fieschi said. \u201cPeople without jobs, high unemployment.

And that\u2019s the populists\u2019 opportunity.\u201d</p> <p>Italy in particular risks an explosion of populist support, Fieschi said. \u201cIf the Germans and the Dutch continue to block some kind of collective support mechanism, the Italians are going to feel this is the third time \u2013 after the financial crisis and the refugee crisis \u2013 that they\u2019ve been hung out to dry.

Immigrant rights advocates, health experts, some members of Congress and even a former official for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) are calling for detainees to be released due to the risks of the virus spreading.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c0dda7d84133eb707857a832424d7e607aa6b885\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0dda7d84133eb707857a832424d7e607aa6b885/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Arizona state representative Kelli Butler calls on Ice to grant Mar\u00eda\u2019s parole in December.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Arizona state representative Kelli Butler calls on Ice to grant Mar\u00eda\u2019s parole in December.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jude Joffe-Block/The  Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For deported asylum seekers like Mar\u00eda, the crisis means many are returning to even more dire situations than the threats they originally fled. In Guatemala, the local economy is paralyzed by the pandemic, with businesses and many government offices shuttered. For those arriving on deportation flights, finding jobs and housing has become all but impossible.</p> <p><strong>\u2022\u2022\u2022</strong></p> <p>The US has deported more than 11,600 people to Guatemala since the beginning of this year, according to data from Guatemala\u2019s Migration Institute. As the corona crisis intensified, concern grew among Guatemalan officials about deportation flights contributing to the spread of Covid-19. Within a week of Mar\u00eda\u2019s 11 March arrival, the Guatemalan government closed its borders and <a href=\"https://www.minex.gob.gt/noticias/Noticia.aspx?id=28628\">announced</a> no new deportation flights from the US could come in until Guatemala prepared new health protocols for repatriated citizens. The flights resumed a few days later but are now less frequent.</p> <p>Ice has begun taking the temperatures of immigrants before they board. Anyone testing above 100.4F gets referred to a medical screening. Guatemalan officials check again when the passengers deplane. The repatriated citizens are then instructed to self-quarantine. Still, a 29-year-old man on a 26 March deportation flight from Arizona tested positive for Covid-19 over the weekend, Guatemala\u2019s health ministry confirmed, and became the country\u2019s 36th case. (The country had confirmed 10 more cases, as of Wednesday night.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/25/family-separation-trump-immigration-nonparents\">She raised her niece like a daughter. Then the US government separated them at the border</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cPrior to boarding, the detainee was screened and neither had a temperature nor presented symptoms at that time,\u201d said an Ice spokesperson in a statement. The agency said before he was deported, the man was booked into a Calexico, California, facility on 5 March and was transferred to a facility in Florence, Arizona, on 17 March.</p> <p>Officials at Guatemala\u2019s foreign relations ministry have said they will continue to receive deportation flights for now.</p> <p>When<strong> </strong>Mar\u00eda and her niece arrived at the Guatemalan airport<strong>,</strong> local authorities took their temperatures but didn\u2019t offer any further assistance or support, Mar\u00eda told the Guardian in Spanish.</p> <p>The pair\u2019s first days in Guatemala were confusing, she said.</p> <p>As she had no family left in the country, her former cellmate at the Eloy detention center offered her a place to stay. But American officials had failed to give Mar\u00eda back her Guatemalan ID before her flight, and with Guatemalan government offices closed amid the pandemic, she cannot replace it.</p> <p>She tried to bring a sense of normalcy to her little girl\u2019s life. They went to church, they celebrated the girl\u2019s seventh birthday and they had Guatemala\u2019s classic Pollo Campero chicken. Mar\u00eda was relieved to eat something besides the potato-based meals served in detention. But with the pandemic lurking, things were anything but normal.</p> <p>Eleven days after Mar\u00eda arrived, President Alejandro Giammattei, a former doctor, instituted a nationwide lockdown between 4pm and 4am every day. Since then, Guatemala\u2019s national civil police have detained more than 5,000 people for violating the rules. Public service announcements show images of deserted streets, bridges and bus stops. Police parade through neighborhoods playing the national anthem, and the president, wearing a protective mask, provides updates on social media.</p> <p>On Sunday, Giammattei said that public officials were doing everything they could to contain Covid-19, but also \u201cto preserve the economic stability that the country has had for a long time\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a great challenge, it\u2019s not easy, but if we unite it will be easier,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Small business owners in Guatemala City like Sergio Vald\u00e9s don\u2019t see such a promising forecast. Just 20 days after he opened the doors of his small restaurant, he had to close its doors. He was allowed to offer takeout, but his five employees could not get to work due to public transportation closures. \u201cThe president says that everything is going to get better, but that\u2019s not the reality,\u201d<strong> </strong>Vald\u00e9s said. \u201cIf you keep a business closed for a while, it will die.\u201d</p> <p>Many Guatemalans who rely on remittances from family members in the US are losing that income as the US unemployment rate climbs. Migrant shelters in Guatemala have reported requests for help from not only migrants and those recently deported, but also Guatemalans who have lost their livelihoods due to the shut-down economy. The global pandemic has revealed the vulnerability of populations already living on the fringes, said Father Mauro Verzeletti, director of Casa del Migrante, a shelter in Guatemala City.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"65b0042a87cc47589203c6242c1ca05bb285c59e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65b0042a87cc47589203c6242c1ca05bb285c59e/0_96_2903_1743/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police officers wearing face masks wave the Guatemalan flag from a police truck on the streets of the Chacara neighborhood during a partial curfew ordered by the government, in Guatemala City on 27 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police officers wearing face masks wave the Guatemalan flag from a police truck on the streets of the Ch\u00e1cara neighborhood during a partial curfew ordered by the government, in Guatemala City on 27 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johan Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a recent tweet, Guatemala\u2019s ombudsman for human rights, Jord\u00e1n Rodas Andrade, called for a moratorium on deportations, or at least a slowdown, that would allow the country\u2019s system of shelters to ramp up to meet the needs of these populations. But deportation proceedings for many detained immigrants have continued. The US government is requiring immigration attorneys to bring their own N95 masks, eye protection and gloves at a time when those items are in short supply for healthcare workers. And under new border policies adopted by the Trump administration since the Covid-19 pandemic, most migrants and asylum seekers apprehended crossing the border are now swiftly returned to their countries. Those asking for asylum at ports of entry are turned away.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Mar\u00eda looked for work as a waitress as soon as she arrived. She knocked on the doors of 15 restaurants and was rejected each time. \u201cRight now, no one is hiring workers, they\u2019re firing people,\u201d Mar\u00eda said. Under the lockdown, she has had to put her search on hold.</p> <p>Mar\u00eda\u2019s options in Guatemala are limited, particularly since it is not safe for her to go back to her home town. She and her little girl <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/25/family-separation-trump-immigration-nonparents\">fled Guatemala</a> for the US in late 2018 after the same gang that murdered Mar\u00eda\u2019s entire family over a land dispute, including the little girl\u2019s mother, killed Mar\u00eda\u2019s partner and shot at Mar\u00eda. Last summer, a US immigration judge found Mar\u00eda\u2019s account credible but decided her case did not meet the narrow legal standard for asylum. Mar\u00eda filed an appeal but could no longer endure being locked up away from her niece. Because she was not the girl\u2019s biological mother, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/21/it-is-beyond-cruel-ice-refuses-to-reunite-girl-with-the-only-family-she-has-left\">Ice refused to release her</a> from detention to reunite the family. After nearly a year apart, Mar\u00eda requested deportation with the hope she and the girl could return together.</p> <p>\u201cIt was notably easier for Ice to concede the bona fides of the relationship between Mar\u00eda and her niece when removal to Guatemala was the goal,\u201d said Suzannah Maclay, Mar\u00eda\u2019s attorney.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/21/it-is-beyond-cruel-ice-refuses-to-reunite-girl-with-the-only-family-she-has-left\">\u2018It is beyond cruel\u2019: Ice refuses to reunite girl with the only family she has left</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mar\u00eda was craving freedom after so long in detention but still finds herself spending her days inside. She wants her niece to go to school and get the education she never got. She feels restless, unable to start building a better life for them both. \u201cI can\u2019t do anything,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She believes the gang that murdered her family still wants to kill her, and she is always fearful they will discover she is back. She doesn\u2019t want her niece to grow up alone. She tries to give the girl a sense of security, but the truth is hard to hide. \u201cWhy did they send us here?\u201d the girl asked her upon arriving in Guatemala. \u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>As Mar\u00eda and her child focus on day-to-day survival, they are also trying to heal from the trauma of their separation. Sometimes the girl tells Mar\u00eda about foster care in New York. The stories are hard to hear. The girl describes getting her hands slapped when she touched things or being scolded in restaurants. \u201cThey humiliated her,\u201d Mar\u00eda said.</p> <p>\u201cMami, I missed you so much,\u201d the girl tells her. \u201cI don\u2019t ever want to be apart again.\u201d Mar\u00eda responds with a promise: \u201cThis won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p> <p><em>Grecia Ortiz in Guatemala City contributed reporting </em></p>",

This decision, if implemented as stated, will deny frontline workers their rightful remuneration increases, which have been negotiated in good faith, with some taking years to achieve.</p> \n   <p>In <strong>something more akin to the Newman years</strong>, it seems the Labor state government has thrown hard-working frontline essential workers to the wolves at the very time we need them the most.</p> \n   <p>In one breath they talk about what a great job our frontline public services workers are doing, then in the next denying them wage increases that have been earned through productivity gains and improvements. Some of these workers have not had pay rises for two years.</p> \n   <p>These are the <strong>public sector workers who make sure ventilators and vital hospital equipment are safe</strong>, they ensure our rail and road networks are safe for commuters and our communities. And of course without power industry workers, there would be no working from home, no Netflix, no air conditioners and many other things our community often takes for granted.</p> \n   <p>Workers risking their lives to keep fellow Queenslanders safe <strong>deserve far better from a premier who seems to have gone weak at knees when attacked by a rabid rightwing media pack, cheered on by a former premier who sacked more than 12,000 public service workers.</strong></p> \n   <p>We believe we can find a way to work with the premier and treasurer to help bolster the economy, but suppressing wages is not the way.

Failure to take action to release people seeking asylum and refugees from detention will not only put them at greater risk of infection (and possibly death), it also risks placing a greater burden on wider Australian society and the health care system.</p> \n   <p>Not only should detainees be released, we call for the resources of IHMS to be put at the disposal of the government to help provide the health services needed in the wider community to bring Covid-19 under control.</p> \n   <p>We call for the release of people seeking asylum and refugees in detention immediately into the community, as the correct measure to take from both a humanitarian and public health perspective.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-02T00:49:38.716Z\">at 1.49am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8532a38f0866297e9f5598\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-02T00:33:22.323Z\">1.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Scott Morrison</strong> will hold a press conference in the next hour. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8531268f0866297e9f558f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-02T00:26:34.713Z\">1.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Northern Territory health service is putting out its daily update:<br></p> \n  <p>The Northern Territory <strong>has recorded two new cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) overnight.</strong></p> \n  <p>A Darwin woman in her 20s has tested positive for the disease after returning from Bali on flight JQ82 on Friday 20 March.</p> \n  <p>She had been in self-quarantine since that time and is now in Royal Darwin Hospital.</p> \n  <p><strong>Passengers on flight JQ82 should be in self-quarantine until Friday 3 April. </strong>If they feel unwell they are urged to contact their doctor or the Centre for Disease Control to arrange testing for COVID-19.</p> \n  <p>An Alice Springs woman who recently returned from the Gold Coast has also been diagnosed with COVID-19.</p> \n  <p>She is in the care of Alice Springs Hospital after being in self-quarantine since her return.</p> \n  <p>Under national medical guidelines, contact tracing on her flights is not required due to the delay between her return and becoming unwell.</p> \n  <p>There have now been 21 cases of COVID-19 diagnosed in the Northern Territory, all acquired interstate or overseas.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e852f7c8f08532a0e6664dc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/paul-karp\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-02T00:19:36.385Z\">1.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Bernard Collaery</strong>, who is being prosecuted for disclosing classified information when he was the lawyer for <strong>Witness K</strong>, who revealed Australia\u2019s spying on East Timor, has won a Covid-19 related delay in proceedings against him.<br></p> \n  <p>The ACT supreme court was to conduct a hearing on the scope of national security information in the case from 7-9 and 14-17 April.<br></p> \n  <p>But Collaery applied to vacate the hearing dates, citing the fact Covid-19 shutdowns made it more difficult to prepare his case, and both senior counsel acting for him have underlying health issues that put them at risk.<br></p> \n  <p>At first the attorney general, <strong>Christian Porter</strong>, neither opposed or supported the application \u2013 but he has now agreed to vacate the dates, according to Justice Mossop: \u201c<em>because of the difficulties in making available the witnesses whose affidavits he wished to rely upon and who had been required for cross-examination.

Their deaths from influenza had existed as an unlived abstraction. That is, until I found myself <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/20/new-york-center-us-coronavirus\">fleeing New York City</a> with my wife, children and dog on the heels of another plague.

Yet despite this privilege, I know we are not truly safe no matter the distance. And this fear is one I recognize not from my own experience but from those I\u2019ve covered as a journalist, people who fled places such as Congo and Somalia and Guatemala and for whom these decisions are tragically commonplace. If anything, the plague has a way of showing us that our exceptionalism is a myth. It shakes us awake with terrifying perspective and shows us who we truly are. As we flee New York and abandon our work and seemingly important plans, I know that I am but a speck of dust beneath a deadly settling fog. I am history made new. Out on the road, I enter communion with the ghosts of my kin.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>My great-grandparents were homeless when the first cases of influenza reached Texas in September 1918. Already it had ripped through Europe, killing thousands of servicemen training and fighting the war. By the end of summer, the plague had reached cities along the eastern seaboard, where it would kill more than 30,000 New Yorkers. In Philadelphia, bodies would be stacked so high in the morgues that \u201cveteran embalmers recoiled and refused to enter\u201d, as one historian noted. At the same time, the virus traveled west on the railroads the same way that we and many others are doing now along the interstate highways, unsure if we\u2019re spreading it from town to town when we pump our gas or hand our credit cards through the drive-thru windows.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5563723130640cd4889c579481eebb12aba26d99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5563723130640cd4889c579481eebb12aba26d99/0_0_1200_1600/750.jpg\" alt=\"Julia Bateson, who died in 1918.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julia Bateson, who died in 1918.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mealer family</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It reached Texas in the midst of a crippling three-year drought, one that had wiped out my family\u2019s farm along with countless others. After the bank foreclosed on their 71 acres near the town of Eastland, my great-grandfather John Lewis Mealer and his wife, Julia, had packed their four children and belongings into a horse-drawn wagon and joined thousands of other refugees seeking shelter.</p> <p>By summer 1918, the roadside between Eastland and Dallas swarmed with homeless families who were broke, hungry and desperate. A layer of dust covered everything, only deepening the misery.</p> <p>\u201cThey have exhausted their own resources and now the people are brought to the point of starvation with no further hopes in the west,\u201d the state representative DJ Neill warned the Texas legislature that August. \u201cMany thousands have turned their faces eastward, homeless, friendless, moneyless \u2026 The people must be fed or leave the country or die.\u201d</p> <p>Yet as thousands fled eastward, many more were coming the other way. In January 1917, a major oil discovery near the town of Ranger, just 10 miles from my family\u2019s land, had sparked the biggest oil boom in the world. Its timing couldn\u2019t have been more perfect for the ongoing war in Europe, where allied forces were dangerously low on fuel, so much that Walter Long, the British secretary of state for the colonies, had told the House of Commons that fall that \u201coil is probably more important at this moment than anything else\u201d.</p> <p>The oil boom swelled the population of Ranger from 1,000 to 30,000 in less than a year. Tent cities and tar-paper shacks rose near the rigs and along the outskirts of town. In the boarding houses, men slept in shifts for lack of beds. Trainloads of boomers and servicemen pulled in each day, some clinging to the roofs. When the plague arrived in September it had easy pickings. In less than a month Ranger reported more than 2,500 cases. El Paso had 4,000 cases and over 400 deaths.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2396041947a406266ef2cc71c8fcaee7be38bf71\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2396041947a406266ef2cc71c8fcaee7be38bf71/0_0_3000_1990/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Red Cross nurse with a gauze mask over her nose and mouth, 1918.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Red Cross nurse with a gauze mask over her nose and mouth, 1918.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Thompson/Illustrated Current News</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By October, the American Red Cross issued a bulletin that was printed in newspapers throughout west Texas listing the various symptoms: bloodshot eyes and high fever, pain in the eyes, ears, head or back, and dizziness. It advised caregivers to wear aprons over clothing and use rags or paper napkins for any sputum or running of the eyes and nose, and to burn them straightaway. It warned against large gatherings and overcrowded homes and offered a jingle for easy memory: \u201cCover up each cough and sneeze, if you don\u2019t you\u2019ll spread disease.\u201d</p> <p>In Abilene, 65 miles west of Ranger, an estimated one in three residents came down with the flu. In many of the bigger towns, movie theaters, churches and schools closed for weeks. Engines went quiet as the workforce was laid up in bed. \u201cWalking canes are very popular among the victim of the \u2019flu\u2019,\u201d the Abilene Reporter wrote, noting that lingering pain in the lower extremities had left legions of hearty and capable fellows hobbling like old men. Recoverees jokingly referred to their new fraternity as the Ancient and Honorable Society of Influenza Victims.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>As we flee New York and abandon our work and seemingly important plans, I know that I am but a speck of dust beneath a deadly settling fog</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Just as Donald Trump and Texas\u2019s lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, have prioritized the economy over public health, there\u2019s no indication that places like Ranger and the surrounding boom<strong> </strong>towns closed shop now that money was pouring in. Officials in nearby Brownwood kept schools and businesses open, defying warnings. Local doctors issued conflicting protocols, and in place of real information many newspapers ran paid editorials that pushed \u201c<a href=\"http://www.bchs.us/BTales_198404.htm\">a powerful reconstructive tonic</a>\u201d called Tanlac to ward off the plague.</p> <p>By the end of October, state health officials reported that more than 6,000 Texans had died.</p> <p>Disinformation bred fear. Just as Trump\u2019s insistence on calling Covid-19 the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/trump-calls-covid-19-the-chinese-virus-as-rift-with-coronavirus-beijing-escalates\">Chinese virus</a>\u201d exacerbates the uptick in assaults on Asian Americans, the same held true in west Texas in 1918. According to relatives, amid this rampant fear and confusion my great-grandparents found shelter at a house in a nearby town. But when the neighbors discovered their presence, a mob formed outside the home and some men dragged out Julia\u2019s belongings to burn in the street. It took the local sheriff arriving to restore peace. The story had always confused me. According to relatives, Julia may have had tuberculosis toward the end of her life, which was fairly common at the time, but I wondered, why would a mob try to burn her clothes?</p> <p>But after having to explain to our kids why so many people were wearing masks on the streets of New York and why they couldn\u2019t touch the subway railings or their faces, or why the apartment always smelled of bleach and our hands were cracked from so many washings, that story about Julia began to make perfect sense. You burn something in order to kill it, to neutralize it into ashes.</p> <p>She died sometime after that incident. The only story about her death that survived is that her coffin was placed on a table wherever they were staying, and their youngest boy, my grandfather Robert Odell, who was four at the time, had crawled beneath it and cried himself to sleep.</p> <p>For years I looked in vain for her grave or any record of her death. One of my uncles says they most likely buried her on the road, \u201cbecause that\u2019s what people did back then\u201d. People who were poor and landless and thus more vulnerable. I\u2019m not sure where John Lewis took his four children after burying his wife, but it was far. Perhaps he was running from the thing that had stalked his family and wanted to protect his children. But his efforts were in vain.</p> <p>In early January 1919, he received word that his oldest daughter, Goldie, who was 24 and married, had fallen ill in Desdemona, a town not far from Ranger. Desdemona was the latest bonanza where gushers were left to blow unattended and oil ran ankle deep through the streets and filled the creeks and gullies. It took two weeks of hard travel for John Lewis and the kids to reach Desdemona. But by the time they arrived she was already dead and buried, having succumbed to pneumonia brought on by the flu.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>The Cracker Barrel restaurant in Crossville, Tennessee, is packed on a Friday night. I sit there waiting for our to-go order and try not to breathe or touch anything, listening as one party after another pays their check with the chatty cashier and never once mentions the virus.</p> <p>That evening at our hotel, the clerk tells my wife the media is overblowing the whole thing in order to bring down Trump, while on Fox News the hosts are still excusing Covid-19 as a hoax and a death knell to a booming economy. I know that during the influenza epidemic some publishers in west Texas were reluctant to report death tolls in their newspapers for fear it would scare away investors to their boom towns, and as a result thousands continued to pour in to make fortunes and eat steaks in the new hotels, while others like John Lewis buried their wives and daughters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"99b9ef1c5dfd9d5d0658ab65d58810a7facc5faa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99b9ef1c5dfd9d5d0658ab65d58810a7facc5faa/0_0_318_447/318.jpg\" alt=\"John Lewis Mealer.\" width=\"318\" height=\"447\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Lewis Mealer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mealer family</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As I drive I find myself communing with this man, asking what he told his children as their mother lay dying in a wagon bed, what words he used to comfort her in her last moments. Could they even afford a doctor, or was their poverty such that Julia just died only to be buried in a field or culvert because that was the fate of the poor?</p> <p>We seek answers from the dead through what Abraham Lincoln called \u201cthe mystic chords of memory\u201d, which connect human experience through the ages. The plague that now stalks our country connects me with John Lewis just as it tethers me to folks half a world away. It gives me sudden new perspective of the Congolese parents I so often interviewed in displacement camps during the war, men and women who described the stress and anxiety that clawed at their guts from having to surrender to a great unknown, not knowing if they or their loved ones would ever see the other side. I\u2019m reminded of the Central American families <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/26/migrant-caravan-disabled-children\">I walked alongside last year</a> in the migrant caravan, who one day held jobs and ran businesses and the next found themselves in a strange country waiting in food lines to feed their children.</p> <p>Yet I know that compared with John Lewis and the people I described, most Americans like me will fare remarkably better. We have the resources that allow us to leave places like New York City or afford homes replete with the necessary groceries, laptops and streaming devices that make quarantine a relatively comfortable ordeal. And if and when we get sick, we\u2019re fortunate to have a healthcare system that, while currently overstressed, is comparatively superior.</p> <p>And still thousands will die in our cities and home towns. The poor and dispossessed will suffer disproportionately, and people we know and love will get sick and not make it. And when this happens we will curse an absent God and blame our leaders. Facebook and Twitter will register the grief and anger, but in the end it will connect us in ways we can\u2019t foresee. For this virus is a hard truth coming down the pike, the way hard truths have done for centuries. They reveal to us the absurdity of our presumptions, the bankruptcy of our entitlement. That our borders are meaningless and the stories we have told ourselves are only stories. When stripped away, we are collectively naked and lonely and afraid under the sun, driving a minivan through Dallas for the first time with no traffic. That we have forgotten what it\u2019s like to be vulnerable and to hurt and to see that in others, which is where God will always be found.</p> <p>Or this is my prayer anyway as I drive seeking counsel from ghosts, looking in the rearview every so often to find that everyone is sound asleep.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I would have been here otherwise, to be honest,\u201d admits Jonathan David. The Canada forward was six when his parents emigrated from Haiti to Ottawa to begin a journey that has led to their son becoming one of the world\u2019s most wanted young players.</p> <p>Before the coronavirus pandemic halted football, David had scored 23 goals in all competitions for the Belgian club Gent this season and was being linked with a summer transfer to the Premier League amid reports that Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham were on the long list of clubs monitoring his rapid progress.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/01/players-afraid-nicaraguan-football-continues-coronavirus-crisis\">'Our players are afraid': Nicaraguan football ploughs on amid the crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That may have to wait given the disruption, although the 20-year-old has time on his side. David has scored an astonishing 11 goals in 12 appearances for his adopted country in a blistering start to his international career but he will never forget his roots.</p> <p>\u201cI still have a lot of affection for Haiti because it is where my family is from and that\u2019s where I grew up,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I moved to Canada, all I knew was life in Haiti; the culture and the way of living. It wasn\u2019t easy \u2013 going somewhere you know really well to the unknown took a bit of time to adapt to. Anywhere you go in the beginning is always difficult. But my parents did it for us to have more security and opportunities. It was a sacrifice they had to make and I\u2019m thankful for that.\u201d</p> <p>David initially found it hard to fulfil his passion in a country more renowned for producing ice hockey players than footballers. He eventually joined the local youth team Ottawa Gloucester SC at the age of 11 before moving to Ottawa Internationals and was called up for Canada\u2019s youth programme four years later.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult in the winter because of the cold weather which means it can be hard to find somewhere to play. We would sometimes play indoors but the facilities were often being used by other sports. We had a great coach so he found a way for us to train and that was very important for me.\u201d</p> <p>David was spotted by scouts from Gent during a youth international and moved to Belgium in 2017 but he was restricted to training with the youth team because Fifa rules dictate that non-EU players must be at least 18. After six months that he believes were crucial in helping him to adapt to the style of play, he scored a last-minute equaliser on his league debut and followed that with another four goals in his next four games, ending his first professional season with 12 as Gent finished fifth.</p> <p>\u201cI am a long way from home and it can be scary because you don\u2019t know what is on the other side,\u201d David says. \u201cBut I knew that this was a sacrifice that I need to make if I am going to become a professional player. When I moved here I had to become a man because I was living on my own. I know my family is only one phone call away but I have to find solutions to problems for myself.\u201d</p> <p>Having signed a contract extension last summer, David\u2019s performances this season had helped Gent to second place before fixtures were postponed. He missed several matches when allowed to return home in December after the unexpected death of his mother, Rose.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b99b73260bacb6f6cc8ee307c360ef9f5d7964e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b99b73260bacb6f6cc8ee307c360ef9f5d7964e/0_0_2693_1793/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jonathan David says: \u2018I want to become one of the best strikers in the world.

The club knew the best thing for me was to be around my family so they let me take the time that I needed and obviously I\u2019m very grateful for that.\u201d</p> <p>David repaid them by getting his first senior hat-trick on 23 February before scoring in the first leg of their Europa League last-32 tie against Roma four days later \u2013 his fifth goal in the competition \u2013 only for Jess Thorup\u2019s side to lose 2-1 on aggregate. The rumour mill went into overdrive but he is trying not to let it go to his head.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t really focus on that or think much about it. Right now I\u2019m playing almost every minute of every game and that has really helped me get to the level that I need to be. I just need to take a good step where I can make sure I am getting enough time on the pitch to keep developing. I don\u2019t want to go somewhere and just stay on the bench so it\u2019s about taking the right step.</p> <p>\u201cI want to become one of the best strikers in the world. That\u2019s my goal. The Premier League is the best in the world and most competitive so obviously that is somewhere I would love to play in the future.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"064fc6da12d9a40879167f61f997e9346037cb55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/064fc6da12d9a40879167f61f997e9346037cb55/0_254_4212_2527/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jonathan David in action for Canada against Cuba in September 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonathan David in action for Canada against Cuba in September 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cole Burston/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The prospect of helping Canada to qualify for their second World Cup is also high on David\u2019s priority list.

The main two changes are to provide two weeks\u2019 unpaid pandemic leave for all employees and an ability to take double leave at half pay.</p> <p>Burke told an Australia@Home lunchtime briefing, hosted by Essential Media director Peter Lewis, there was an \u201cissue for permanent full-time and part-timers\u201d that emerged from a treasury briefing to Labor on Thursday.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re stood down, it\u2019s already the case that employers can say you\u2019ve got to use up your leave first, and they start running down your leave,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat it looks like will be possible is: if the employer gets the wage subsidy, instead of passing it through to you as a wage, they collect it and still have you running down your leave entitlements.</p> <p>\u201cSo effectively, instead of the government subsidising someone\u2019s wage, they\u2019re subsidising the balance sheet for an employer while the employer simply runs down all the leave entitlements of their employees.\u201d</p> <p>Burke said he was \u201cshocked\u201d and \u201cstunned\u201d by the revelation \u2013 because Labor thought the jobkeeper payment was \u201cmeant to flow through to the workers to give them an extra payment, not [flow] through as they collect entitlements they had already earned\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt might seem technical but there are hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, of permanent workers, who at the end of this will either have some of their leave entitlements or won\u2019t, based on whether this loophole survives.\u201d</p> <p>Burke said this was what the government was \u201ccurrently contemplating\u201d, although it \u201cmight not turn out this way in the legislation\u201d.</p> <p>Labor is also concerned that casuals with less than 12 months\u2019 service with their current employer \u2013 including many workers in retail and hospitality, teachers who move between schools, entertainment and arts workers on forward contracts and many construction workers \u2013 are set to miss out.</p> <p>Unveiling the jobkeeper payment on Monday, the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said it was one of many measures to help \u201cbuild a bridge to the recovery\u201d by pursuing a \u201chibernation strategy\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis payment will give working Australians their best chance of keeping their job and keeping them connected to their employers so that they can bounce back in the recovery phase,\u201d he said.</p> <p>On Thursday Porter summarised a raft of industrial relations reforms achieved \u201cbehind the scenes in a quiet and cooperative way\u201d between employers and unions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/02/real-estate-agents-criticised-for-suggesting-tenants-consider-using-superannuation-to-pay-rent\">Real estate agents criticised for suggesting tenants consider using superannuation to pay rent</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Temporary changes to the restaurant, hospitality and clerks award would change work conditions for 2m Australians during the Covid-19 crisis, allowing workers to move to perform another type of duty in another type of classification and facilitate working from home.</p> <p>\u201cRemarkably, some of the awards were so inflexible it was actually unlawful to work from home,\u201d Porter said. Some 103 modern awards would be changed to provide two weeks of unpaid pandemic leave for all employees, including casuals, and to allow employees to take double the duration of leave at half the pay, he said.</p> <p>\u201cNow, you can see how those common-sense changes would allow the flexibility in a number of businesses, which \u2026 could well make the difference between survival of the business and preservation of the jobs or the failure of the business and the loss of the jobs.

Many earn either too little or too much, or only started working for themselves in the past year, or pay themselves in dividends rather than salary \u2013 all factors that can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/02/millions-uk-slip-through-coronavirus-pay-wage-safety-net-self-employed-wage-subsidy\">disqualify them from receiving the assistance</a>. The BBC has reported overnight that British Airways may be preparing to suspend 36,000 staff from duties.</p> \n<p>The government has admitted that just 2,000 of half a million frontline NHS staff have been tested to date for Covid-19. Strict laboratory protocols and shortages of the required chemicals are part of the problem, and senior researchers have told the Guardian that the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/nhs-rules-hampering-coronavirus-testing-drive-say-scientists\">must find alternatives to speed things up</a>. Boris Johnson has admitted the country needs to \u201cmassively ramp up\u201d the two separate tests that show whether people have, or have had, the disease. It has emerged that a major NHS hospital in London <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/02/london-hospital-almost-runs-out-oxygen-coronavirus-patients\">almost ran out of oxygen</a> for its Covid-19 patients on ventilators last week. All NHS trusts in England have been told to carefully work out how many people they can have on ventilators and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines to make sure their supplies do not fail.</p> \n<p>Security is understood to have been tightened for Dr Anthony Fauci, the 79-year-old infectious disease expert who is the voice of authority at Donald Trump\u2019s coronavirus briefings. Despite drawing admiration throughout the US he has received threats and become a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/dr-fauci-security-reportedly-expanded-as-infectious-disease-expert-faces-threats\">public target for rightwing pundits and bloggers</a> who accuse him of undermining the president (there has also apparently been unwanted attention from fervent admirers). Trump meanwhile has admitted the federal US government\u2019s own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/01/trump-coronavirus-stockpile-ppe-briefing\">emergency stockpile of protective equipment</a> is nearly exhausted.

Things appeared normal until you noticed the cracks, jaunty angles and misaligned lintels. The spray paint from the rescue teams was still visible on shops; the empty white chairs, one for every life lost, stood wistfully in the centre, and the beautiful cathedral was fenced off in disrepair.

In Myanmar, rural <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/04/un-warns-of-possible-new-war-crimes-in-myanmar\" title=\"\">encampments</a> where thousands of people are being forced to live on the basis of their ethnicity. On small islands and in deserts at the edges of wealthy regions \u2013 Greece\u2019s Aegean islands, the Negev Desert in Israel, the Pacific Ocean near Australia, the southern Mediterranean coastline \u2013 various types of large holding centres for would-be migrants.</p> <p>The scale and purpose of these places vary considerably, as do the political regimes that have created them, but they share certain things in common. Most were established as temporary or \u201cemergency\u201d measures, but have outgrown their original stated purpose and become seemingly permanent. Most exist thanks to a mix of legal ambiguity \u2013 detention centres operating outside the regular prison system, for instance \u2013 and physical isolation. And most, if not all, have at times been described by their critics as concentration camps.</p> <p>We tend to associate the idea of concentration camps with their most extreme instances \u2013 the Nazi Holocaust, and the Soviet Gulag system; genocide in Cambodia and Bosnia. But the disturbing truth is that concentration camps have been widespread throughout recent history, used to intern civilians that a state considers hostile, to control the movement of people in transit and to extract forced labour. The author Andrea Pitzer, in <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/one-long-night-9780316303569.html\" title=\"\">One Long Night</a>, her recent history of concentration camps, estimates that at least one such camp has existed somewhere on Earth throughout the past 100 years.</p> <p>The definition of a concentration camp is sometimes fuzzy, but at root, such camps represent a combination of physical and legal power. They are a way for modern states to segregate groups of civilians by placing them in a closed or isolated location via special rules that are distinct from a country\u2019s main system of rights and punishments. Many have been set up under military jurisdiction \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/dec/09/paulharris.theobserver\" title=\"\">by the British</a> during the Boer war, for instance \u2013 while others, such as the Soviet gulags, have been used in peacetime to deal with social \u201cundesirables\u201d.</p> <p>Cruelty and the abuse of power have existed throughout human history, but concentration camps have not. They are little more than a century old. The earliest began as wartime measures, but on numerous occasions since then they have become lasting features. They are a product of technologically advanced societies with sophisticated legal and political systems and have been made possible by a range of modern inventions. Military technologies such as automatic weapons or barbed wire made it easier for small groups of officials to hold much larger groups of people captive. Advanced bureaucracy and surveillance techniques enabled states to watch, count and categorise civilians in ways they couldn\u2019t have done in earlier eras. As Pitzer writes, such camps \u201cbelong in the company of the atomic bomb as one of the few advanced innovations in violence\u201d.</p> <p>This innovation haunts the political imagination of liberal democracies. The concentration camp is a symbol of everything such societies are supposed to stand against: the arbitrary use of power and the stripping of people\u2019s rights, the systematic removal of liberty; dehumanisation, abuse, torture, murder and genocide. When it is used to refer to contemporary places, the term \u201cconcentration camp\u201d is often reserved for the locations of the most serious human rights abuses, as when Amnesty International used it in a 2017 report estimating that 13,000 people had been murdered by Syria\u2019s Assad regime in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/07/saydnaya-prison-assad-slaugterhouse-amnesty-report-torture-mass-hangings\" title=\"\">Saydnaya military prison</a> outside Damascus. But politicians, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez among them, have also <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-unimaginable-reality-of-american-concentration-camps\" title=\"\">used the term</a> to describe camps such as the ones the Trump administration has been running on the US border with Mexico.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>To some, these comparisons minimise the use of concentration camps by Nazi Germany in its effort to exterminate Jews. For others, the comparisons are a necessary warning, not least because one kind of camp can easily transform into another. Pitzer gives the example of a refugee camp: if people are not allowed to leave, and are systematically denied their rights, then it starts to resemble more sinister creations. As authoritarians and rightwing populists reach positions of power in various parts of the world, liberals are voicing fears that history is repeating itself.</p> <p>Surveying what he called \u201ca century of camps\u201d in the mid-90s, the sociologist Zygmunt Bauman warned that the temptation for governments to use them would always be strong \u201cwhen certain humans are declared redundant or forced into a superfluous condition\u201d. There is no shortage of threats in the current century \u2013 from environmental catastrophe to the unfolding coronavirus pandemic \u2013 that are creating such conditions. The question is how to ensure that the concentration camp is not the state\u2019s inevitable response.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>It is tempting to regard the concentration camp as an anomaly, but for some observers, such camps are a grim reflection of the way modern states work. After the second world war, as knowledge of the Holocaust became widespread, leading theorists sought to offer explanations for the genocide that had taken place, and the methods used to carry it out. Writing in 1950, the Martiniquan poet and politician Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire argued that the Holocaust \u201capplied to Europe colonialist procedures\u201d that until then had been reserved exclusively for people of colour.</p> <p>Concentration camps were indeed colonial in origin. Their earliest uses came at the turn of the 20th century \u2013 by the Spanish in 1896 to put down a rebellion in Cuba, by the US in 1899 to do similar in the Philippines, and by the British empire in southern Africa during the Boer war of 1899-1902. The first use of concentration camps for a deliberate policy of extermination was not in Europe but in German South West Africa \u2013 modern-day Namibia \u2013 between 1904 and 1907. (Germany only recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/25/germany-moves-to-atone-for-forgotten-genocide-in-namibia\" title=\"\">officially acknowledged</a> its treatment of the Herero and Nama tribes as genocide.)</p> <p>For C\u00e9saire, the appearance of camps in Europe itself was a direct result of the way in which Europeans had attempted to dehumanise their colonial subjects in order to exploit them, but ended up dehumanising themselves. \u201cColonisation,\u201d he wrote, \u201cworks to decivilise the coloniser, to brutalise him in the true sense of the word, to degrade him, to awaken him to buried instincts, to covetousness, violence, race hatred and moral relativism.\u201d</p> <p>The German-Jewish political theorist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/01/totalitarianism-in-age-donald-trump-lessons-from-hannah-arendt-protests\" title=\"\">Hannah Arendt</a> also turned her attention to camps after the war. Like C\u00e9saire, Arendt drew links between the behaviour of European powers in their colonies and their conduct at home, but she also highlighted how some of the tools wielded by authoritarians had been put in place by democracies before the rise of fascism. In her 1951 book The Origins of Totalitarianism, Arendt pointed out that when France was occupied by Nazi Germany, for instance, the Gestapo was able to make use of draconian police powers already in existence to round up and detain civilians. These existed because France, like many other states in Europe, had been unable to deal with the mass displacement of people in the aftermath of the first world war and had instituted harsh measures to deal with unwanted migrants.</p> <p>In 1940, Arendt had her own direct experience of this relatively novel form of containment. After fleeing Germany for France, she was placed in an internment camp at Gurs, near the Pyrenees. The camp had been established a few years earlier to detain republican refugees from the Spanish civil war; it was repurposed in 1939 for \u201cenemy aliens\u201d \u2013 a practice instigated by the British in the first world war and subsequently copied by many countries. The inmates had to endure overcrowding, disease and insufficient food rations, and were made to live together regardless of the fact that some were Nazi party members and others, like Arendt, were Jewish refugees. It was partly the memory of this that led Arendt to place internment on a continuum with the Soviet gulags and the Nazi death camps \u2013 as she saw it, the \u201cHades, Purgatory and Hell\u201d of state violence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b8900bf8b4737485bc903be41072732c1f172512\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8900bf8b4737485bc903be41072732c1f172512/0_0_4866_3228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The former Nazi concentration camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The former Nazi concentration camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Damian Klamka/SOPA/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That the British, Americans, Spanish, French and Germans, among other nations, had all used concentration camps led some thinkers to ask whether such camps were inevitable features of the modern state. Perhaps the most provocative answer comes from the Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben, whose ideas have grown in prominence in the past two decades. For Agamben, the existence of the concentration camp reveals something fundamental about power \u2013 who holds it, and what gives them the authority to wield it. His work is dense, ranging across ancient Greek and Roman law, Biblical texts and Renaissance literature, but it has been influential on a generation of scholars and activists in the past two decades \u2013 particularly among those who wanted to understand the camp established by the US at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/dec/13/saifullah-uzair-paracha-guantanamo-bay-al-qaida-war-on-terror\" title=\"\">Guant\u00e1namo Bay</a>, under an emergency policy after 9/11, or the growing phenomenon of immigration detention at the borders of the rich world.</p> <p>Sovereignty, as Agamben sees it, is founded on absolute power over human life, and has been since ancient times. The sovereign has the power not only to kill, but to strip people of rights through forms of banishment, reducing them to a state of what he calls \u201cbare life\u201d. In the past, sovereignty would have been concentrated in the figure of the monarch; modern states are supposed to have improved upon monarchy by restraining the arbitrary use of power through democratic checks and balances. But, according to Agamben, the tendency to banish and dehumanise keeps on coming back in the form of the concentration camp: a space where people are outside the law, yet more subject to its power than anywhere else.</p> <p>For Agamben, this reveals the basis on which power is exercised by modern states. In his words, the concentration camp is the \u201cnomos\u201d or fundamental principle of modern societies, the \u201chidden matrix\u201d of politics in our age. While they may only sometimes use it, governments retain the power to declare emergency measures \u2013 a \u201cstate of exception\u201d in Agamben\u2019s words \u2013 to strip us of rights, and confine us to spaces in which we live a kind of exile. The camp\u2019s logic, he implies, pervades seemingly free societies through modern state techniques of surveillance, bureaucracy, violence and other forms of coercion.</p> <p>Grand theories such as those of C\u00e9saire, Arendt and Agamben are valuable, but risky. By seeking to identify common patterns across specific societies, at different moments in history, they warn that all modern states have the potential to set up concentration camps. Misconstrued, however, they can end up obscuring crucial differences \u2013 such as the distinction between camps used in a deliberate policy of extermination, and those where people die through neglect. Holocaust deniers, for instance, or people who seek to downplay the severity of colonial massacres, often try to muddy these distinctions.</p> <p>When theory becomes dogma, it can also limit our understanding of the present. Agamben\u2019s own recent trajectory offers a cautionary tale: in late February 2020, he published a short essay in the leftwing Italian newspaper <em>Il Manifesto</em> criticising his government\u2019s draconian restrictions on public freedoms aimed at halting the spread of the coronavirus. The piece referred to \u201cthe invention of an epidemic\u201d, and went further than merely questioning the long-term impact of these restrictions; it condemned them as \u201cfrenetic, irrational, and entirely unfounded\u201d, arguing the virus was \u201cnot too different from the normal flu\u201d. The piece has been widely criticised, and provoked a retort from the French philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy that had he listened to Agamben\u2019s advice not to have a heart operation 30 years ago, he would now be dead.</p> <p>Agamben is hardly the only person to have underestimated the threat posed by the coronavirus in recent months. As more governments pass emergency laws to deal with the pandemic, in some cases including draconian surveillance measures and the establishment of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/pakistan-coronavirus-camp-no-facilities-no-humanity\" title=\"\">segregated quarantine camps</a>, it is right to ask where these might lead, and whether states will be willing to give up their new powers once the immediate danger to public health has passed. But that shouldn\u2019t obscure the fact that some emergencies are real: in these situations, the most important question is whether societies can respond to them without permanently destroying people\u2019s rights.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Concentration camps are uniquely dangerous spaces. Their effects may vary considerably, from the horror of Auschwitz to the more mundane misery that Arendt experienced in Gurs, but the people caught up in them almost always end up being treated as less than human. And if the political and technological innovations of the late 19th century made them possible, does the 21st century make them any more likely?</p> <p>In 2014, the Chinese government launched an initiative it called the <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2018/09/09/eradicating-ideological-viruses/chinas-campaign-repression-against-xinjiangs\" title=\"\">Strike Hard Campaign Against Violent Terrorism</a>, focused on the province of Xinjiang, in the country\u2019s far west. In the English-speaking world, details of the programme remained scarce until 2017, when reports started to filter through that thousands of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/aug/07/why-uighur-muslims-across-china-are-living-in-fear\" title=\"\">people from Xinjiang\u2019s ethnic U</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/aug/07/why-uighur-muslims-across-china-are-living-in-fear\" title=\"\">ighur population</a>, most of whom are Muslims, were being detained. The following year, researchers who trawled through Chinese government procurement documents and satellite imagery pointed to the existence of a vast, newly constructed complex of internment camps, which they estimated had the capacity to hold anywhere between several hundred thousand and 1.5 million people. Former inmates have given testimony to journalists and researchers that they were forced into \u201ceducation\u201d programmes, made to eat pork and drink alcohol, and given compulsory sterilisation and abortions.</p> <p>This is just one example of how globalisation and technology have added a new dimension to an old problem. China has a long history of running camps \u2013 the political \u201cre-education\u201d programme launched by Mao in the 50s was one of the world\u2019s most extensive gulag networks. But the latest crackdown has new features. First, the Xinjiang camps are backed up by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/apr/11/china-hi-tech-war-on-muslim-minority-xinjiang-uighurs-surveillance-face-recognition\" title=\"\">state-of-the-art digital surveillance</a> methods provided by leaders in the global tech industry: a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/world/asia/china-surveillance-xinjiang.html\" title=\"\">computerised CCTV network</a> developed by a state-run defence manufacturer, designed to \u201capply the ideas of military cybersystems to civilian public security\u201d, which tracks individuals and analyses their behaviour to anticipate potential crime; a tracking app that visitors to Xinjiang are obliged to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/7/3/20681258/china-uighur-surveillance-app-tourist-phone\" title=\"\">install on their smartphones</a>; DNA analysis equipment <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/02/19/china-xinjiang-surveillance-biosecurity-state-dna-western-tech/\" title=\"\">partly supplied by US biotech firms</a>. Second, China has justified its crackdown to the rest of the world by adopting the same rhetoric that the US and its allies used after 9/11. In 2014, the Communist party launched its so-called \u201cpeople\u2019s war on terror\u201d in Xinjiang. China\u2019s methods may be extreme, but it is by no means the first country to have introduced policies that subject Muslims to collective suspicion and punishment, in response to violent Islamic fundamentalist groups.</p> <p>What else could tempt states to open camps? In her 2014 book Expulsions, the sociologist Saskia Sassen argues that the particular form of globalisation the world has experienced in recent decades \u2013 driven by a new form of laissez-faire economics \u2013 has unleashed a dangerous new dynamic that excludes large numbers of people from economic and social life. The global shift to \u201cprivatisations, deregulation and open borders for some\u201d has brutally punished the vulnerable and accelerated environmental destruction.</p> <p>In richer countries, Sassen argues, this leads to low-income workers being forced out of established welfare and healthcare programmes into more punitive systems (such as the UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/23/million-families-cut-universal-credit-benefits-debts\" title=\"\">universal </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/23/million-families-cut-universal-credit-benefits-debts\" title=\"\">credit scheme</a>), the impoverishment of sections of the middle class through austerity policies, and more and more people being locked up in prison. In poorer parts of the world, this means mass displacement and the warehousing of migrants as they try to move elsewhere.</p> <p>One result of these global pressures has been the rise of political movements that promise to shore up national, religious or ethnic identities. But identities are ambiguous, and when governments start using the tools of state power to reinforce the line between insider and outsider, there are always large numbers of people who get caught in between. In India, the government of Narendra Modi has been trying to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/20/hindu-supremacists-nationalism-tearing-india-apart-modi-bjp-rss-jnu-attacks\" title=\"\">reshape the country</a> along Hindu nationalist lines, undermining the secular and pluralist principles that have held sway since independence. The emerging camps in Assam, a north-eastern state on the border with Bangladesh, are a result: they target thousands of mainly Muslim residents who may have lived in India for decades, but because they originally came from across the border in Bangladesh \u2013 a legacy of partition \u2013 have never been registered as citizens.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"328a035019c9f4df1c293edb8f017415f32e81f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/328a035019c9f4df1c293edb8f017415f32e81f9/0_264_5100_3059/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A detention centre under construction in Assam, India.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A detention centre under construction in Assam, India.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The understandable response when confronted with injustice is to look for someone to blame. It\u2019s easier to do so when oppression is perpetrated by villainous leaders, or in other people\u2019s societies. But particularly in liberal democracies, the chains of responsibility can be complex. Who, for instance, is responsible for the arbitrary imprisonment, torture and slave-labour conditions that migrants and refugees <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/10/libya-public-slave-auctions-un-migration\" title=\"\">in Libya</a> are subjected to? The immediate answer seems fairly simple: the state officials and local militias, some linked to trafficking networks, who run the detention centres. Thousands of people, mainly from sub-Saharan Africa, are imprisoned in a network of these centres where they are regularly subjected to starvation, disease, torture, rape, and forced labour.</p> <p>But the reason those detention centres exist is because a range of European governments have been trying to get Libya to act as a block on unwanted migration across the Mediterranean for almost 20 years. The system was built with European support, both from national governments and at EU level \u2013 first through agreements with the government of Muammar Gaddafi, then, as the country collapsed after he was overthrown by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/23/nothing-moral-nato-intervention-libya\" title=\"\">Nato-backed uprising</a>, a patchwork of arrangements with state officials and local militias.</p> <p>There is no shortage of information about what happens in Libyan detention centres \u2013 and European governments frequently profess their horror at the atrocities committed there. Yet the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/05/eu-deal-libya-refugees-libyan-detention-centres\" title=\"\">system persists</a>, because those governments broadly agree that the goal of limiting migration is more important than dismantling Libya\u2019s detention system. The political consensus in most European countries, including the UK, is that limiting unwanted migration is a reasonable and desirable aim, and large numbers of their citizens have voted in support of it.</p> <p>When Zygmunt Bauman turned his attention to camps in the 90s, he argued that what characterises violence in our age is distance \u2013 not just the physical or geographical distance that technology allows, but the social and psychological distance produced by complex systems in which it seems everybody and nobody is complicit. This, for Bauman, works on three levels. First, actions are carried out by \u201ca long chain of performers\u201d, in which people are both givers and takers of orders. Second, everybody involved has a specific, focused job to perform. And third, the people affected hardly ever appear fully human to those within the system. \u201cModernity did not make people more cruel,\u201d Bauman wrote, \u201cit only invented a way in which cruel things could be done by non-cruel people.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>When something today is described as a concentration camp, it almost always provokes an angry dispute. If camps aren\u2019t being used to exterminate people, as they have been in their worst instances, then the comparison is frequently condemned as inappropriate. But condemnation can be a way for governments to shield themselves from criticism of their decisions, and from criticism of the legitimacy of state power itself.</p> <p>In 2018, Donald Trump\u2019s government responded to a rise in the number of undocumented migrants \u2013 many of whom were asylum-seekers fleeing violence in Central America \u2013 crossing the US-Mexico border by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/24/detained-us-largest-immigrant-detention-trump\" title=\"\">drastically increasing</a> the use of long-term immigration detention. Reports of overcrowding, filthy conditions and the denial of due process for asylum claims soon followed, accompanied by measures that seemed intended to make a symbolic display of cruelty, such as the separation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/jul/11/what-is-happening-to-migrant-children-at-us-border-facilities-podcast\" title=\"\">young children</a> from their parents. In June 2019, amid the outcry from opponents of this policy, congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez recorded a video for her Instagram followers: \u201cThe US is running concentration camps on our southern border,\u201d she stated, \u201cand that is exactly what they are \u2026 I want to talk to the people that are concerned enough with humanity to say that \u2018never again\u2019 means something.\u201d</p> <p>This was a political intervention intended to shock people into challenging the Trump government\u2019s immigration policy \u2013 and in the row that ensued, some commentators objected that Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s reference to concentration camps and her use of the phrase \u201cnever again\u201d was an inappropriate Holocaust analogy. As the historian Deborah Lipstadt commented, \u201csomething can be horrible and not be like the Holocaust\u201d.</p> <p>But much of the response from Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Republican opponents was to downplay the extent of abuses happening as a result of Trump\u2019s policies, or to portray what was happening as normal and routine. Some pointed out, for instance, that Trump was only making modifications to a system built by his predecessors: deportations of undocumented immigrants, for instance, reached their peak under Barack Obama. These sorts of equivocations have accompanied the use of camps from their inception, and they always try to give the same impression: that what\u2019s being done is normal and legitimate, that criticisms are overblown, marginal and extreme; and that states have the right to behave this way.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c5b3c37e194a935b407c437173123eb2de51b4a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5b3c37e194a935b407c437173123eb2de51b4a6/0_0_4016_3012/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Central Processing Center in McAllen, Texas, where people were detained after crossing the US-Mexico border.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Central Processing Center in McAllen, Texas, where people were detained after crossing the US-Mexico border.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The story of Britain\u2019s concentration camps during the Boer war illustrates how a society that thinks of itself as liberal can make excuses for a mass crime. In 1899, when the British empire went to war against two breakaway Afrikaner republics in South Africa, it set up a network of camps that quickly expanded to detain several hundred thousand people. At first the camps were justified as \u201cprotection\u201d for Boer civilians who had signed an oath of loyalty; later, they were used to imprison Boer \u201cundesirables\u201d who had not signed the oath, as well as black South Africans who the British forced off their land to make them act as lookouts for troops. Due to poor sanitation, meagre food rations and overcrowding, diseases such as typhoid and measles frequently ripped through the camps; at least 28,000 white people and 20,000 black people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/1999/oct/10/focus.news\" title=\"\">were killed</a> by this system in just a few years.</p> <p>The two most prominent critics of Britain\u2019s camps \u2013 the feminist campaigners Emily Hobhouse and Millicent Fawcett \u2013 both had to struggle against political and public opinion that initially saw the camps as a wartime necessity, and both fought hard to alleviate suffering. But the grounds on which they did so were radically different, as the author Vron Ware <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09502386.2019.1638953\" title=\"\">has recently argued</a>. Fawcett, who visited South Africa with the government\u2019s approval to produce a report on the camps, saw her concern for the welfare of vulnerable civilians as compatible with the wider aims of the camps. \u201cSaving the children,\u201d for her, was \u201cas true a service to the country as that which men were rendering by going into the armies to serve in the field\u201d. But for Hobhouse, who was the first prominent activist to visit South Africa and expose conditions in the camps, British military values and the nationalism that underpinned them were the fundamental problem. She was challenging the legitimacy of state power itself.</p> <p>Hobhouse, who in her day was derided in sexist terms as a \u201cmad\u201d old lady, is now largely forgotten, while it is safe to say that Britain\u2019s concentration camps are not well remembered: last year the Conservative politician Jacob Rees-Mogg <a href=\"https://www.sahistory.org.za/archive/concentration-camps-south-african-war-here-are-real-facts-fransjohan-pretorius-conversation\" title=\"\">defended their use</a> on an episode of Question Time, erroneously claiming that their mortality rate was only the same as that of Glasgow\u2019s at the time. But without Hobhouse\u2019s radical critique, it would have been harder to oppose the harm done by Britain\u2019s camps a century ago, and would be harder to understand why camps still appear in the world today.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6e0b4a87219837871e4dcae0f3df32ad2663b0c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e0b4a87219837871e4dcae0f3df32ad2663b0c2/0_227_1810_1085/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A concentration camp for Boers during the Boer war.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A concentration camp for Boers during the Boer war.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The point of historical comparisons should not be to find identical situations \u2013 no two events in history are identical \u2013 but to alert us to potential dangers in the way states exercise power. Not everyone, for instance, reacted with outrage to Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s comments last year. While she drew criticism from some Jewish organisations, including a rebuke from the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, the row also energised a US protest movement against Trump\u2019s immigration policy led by leftwing Jewish activists. The movement calls itself <a href=\"https://www.neveragainaction.com/\" title=\"\">Never Again Action</a>, explicitly drawing on a collective memory of persecution.</p> <p>In his final book, The Drowned and the Saved, the Auschwitz survivor and author Primo Levi reflected on the conditions that had made the Nazi camps possible, and wondered what lessons, if any, could be applied to a world that had moved on. The unique combination of factors that had unleashed the horror of Nazism was unlikely to return, he thought, but that should not obscure the danger of violence in our own time, or the politicians who seek to wield it. Violence, he wrote, \u201cis there before our eyes \u2026 it only awaits its new buffoon (there is no dearth of candidates) to organise it, legalise it, declare it necessary and mandatory and so contaminate the world\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>If the state as we know it is here to stay, then what can people do when governments start building camps? The history of the concentration camp has also been a history of people\u2019s resistance to camps, from both inside and out. Even in the most seemingly hopeless situations there are stories of people who have fought back against their treatment. The uprisings in the Nazi death camps of Sobibor and Treblinka are among the most famous; and the Soviet Gulag system was beset by strikes and revolts. On their own, these may not have been enough, but camps work by enforcing a rigid distinction between people on opposite sides of the barbed-wire fence. Those inside are kept silent and invisible, while those outside are encouraged to ignore or accept what is happening. Successful resistance aims at breaking down this distinction: governments know this, and even states that operate relatively mild forms of mass detention make significant efforts to obscure the conditions inside, and to deter their own citizens from prying too closely.</p> <p>One evening in February this year, I watched the Kurdish author Behrouz Boochani give a talk by video link to an audience at Birkbeck, University of London. Boochani, who currently lives in New Zealand, spent four years in Australia\u2019s \u201cregional offshore processing centre\u201d for asylum-seekers on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/manus-island\" title=\"\">Manus Island</a>, Papua New Guinea. Australia has pioneered a type of long-term detention for unwanted migrants that is now becoming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/12/how-europes-far-right-fell-in-love-with-australias-immigration-policy\" title=\"\">more common</a> elsewhere in the world. Boochani and his fellow detainees were not merely being held for \u201cprocessing\u201d, but in harsh conditions intended to act as a deterrent to future travellers.

For Boochani, writing was not simply a way to expose his conditions and link up with campaigners against detention on the outside, but to challenge the very basis on which the treatment of people like him was justified. \u201cI never use the language and the words that the [Australian] government use,\u201d he said. \u201cI say \u2018systematic torture\u2019, I say \u2018political prisoner.\u2019\u201d One of the things that gave him hope in confinement, he said, was the fact that animals could wander in and out of the spaces where human freedom was limited \u2013 a reminder that the structure which held him was built by people, and could therefore also be dismantled. \u201cNature,\u201d he said, \u201calways tried to reimpose itself on the prison.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",

  "<p>NSW Police\u2019s Marine Area Command has provided an escort for NSW Health and an independent medical team to board the stricken cruise ship, Ruby Princess, off the coast of Sydney earlier Thursday to assess the health of more than 1,100 crew and whether they are infected with Covid 19.</p> <p>The joint operation between Australian Border Force and NSW Police is part of the Australian government\u2019s efforts to deal with at eight cruise ships that are in Australian waters off the east coast and which have ignored an order to leave to their home ports.</p> <p>No police officers boarded the vessel, the police said in a statement.</p> <p>\u201cDuring today\u2019s joint operation, a 66-year-old crew member was transported from the vessel requiring medical care,\u201d it said.</p> <p>\u201cThe NSW Police Force is also assisting with a number of medical evacuations and transfers of Australian crew members from several cruise ships anchored off Sydney,\u201d the police said.</p> <p>NSW Police commissioner Mick Fuller, who is in charge of the cruise ship situation in NSW will provide an update on the evolving operation regarding the management of cruise ships on Friday morning.</p> <p>Earlier in the day the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said Australia had an obligation to provide healthcare to people who are sick and within our territorial waters, and that the government would take doctors from a private company to review health of about 8,500 crew, mostly foreigners, are onboard the ships owned by Carnival Cruises and Royal Caribbean.</p> <p>The prime minister said in his midday press conference that the ships off the New South Wales coast had been \u201cvisited for the purposes of health checks very, very recently\u201d .</p> <p>The Australian government ordered the vessels to leave Australia waters during the Covid-19 pandemic but they have so far refused to do so and some sick crew members have had to be medically evacuated to Australian hospitals.</p> <p>Fuller has the final say on who can disembark cruise ships.</p> <p>On Thursday morning Fuller said he feared that \u201cbringing 9,000 people off the cruise ships\u201d could \u201coverload\u201d the state\u2019s health system. \u201cWe know around the world that when the hospital systems become overwhelmed, then lots and lots of people die.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/01/coronavirus-calls-to-repatriate-15000-crew-members-from-cruise-ships-off-australias-coast\">Coronavirus: NSW government considers military-style operation to test crew on cruise ships off Australia's coast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>NSW police also forced another cruise ship, the Pacific Explorer<em>,</em> to leave Sydney harbour and anchor off the coast.</p> <p>Sture Myrmell, the president of Carnival Australia, which operates the Pacific Explorer, said in a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Af1oWtHll6Y\">statement posted to YouTube</a> that the decision was \u201cparticularly sad and disappointing\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cBeing able to send home those crew members who are not required for the safe operation of the ship is the right thing to do both from a humanitarian point of view and Australia\u2019s international standing as a maritime nation that looks after foreign nationals in its care,\u201d Myrmell said.</p> <p>\u201cWe remain concerned that it is not safe for the ship to sail away from Australian while there are crew members on board who are ill. </p> <p>\u201cAustralia has maritime obligations to protect the welfare of seafarers and as such we need to care for foreign nationals as we would expect other nations to care for Australians in similar circumstances abroad.\u201d</p> <p>But Morrison made it clear Australia would honour its international obligations to assist the sick in its waters.</p> <p>\u201cIf there are people who are sick and need healthcare, then whether it is a foreign national off our shores or an Australian somewhere else, then countries have been respecting that and that is the position of the Australian government,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThat has been respected, that has been honoured, as recently as we have seen in Western Australia with the cases that are there. We are provisioning those ships, so they will be able to move on their way.\u201d</p> <p>Support to reach the ships and process any people evacuated is being provided by the defence forces.</p> <p>A defence department spokesman said: \u201cAt the request of the New South Wales government, Defence is planning to provide land-based logistics and additional quarantine compliance at some NSW ports in support of NSW police.\u201d</p> <p>The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, said on Thursday that non-Australian residents who were trapped on the ships could be \u201cextracted\u201d and \u201cflown back to their country of origin\u201d.</p> <p>Six crew members from the Ruby Princess cruise ship, which has now had more than 500 confirmed cases of coronavirus, had already been taken to Australian hospitals after falling ill. It remains off the coast of Sydney with 1,100 crew onboard.</p> <p>Doctors from the private company Aspen Medical will be taken to the seven ships off shore \u2013 an eighth is in port in Sydney \u2013 to determine how many crew are ill with Covid-19. It is then hoped the ships will depart for their port of origin \u2013 usually a flag- of-convenience port such as the Bahamas or Malta.</p> <p> Dutton said on Thursday that if ships were free of Covid-19, then it might be possible to send them out to sea or repatriate crew without risk.</p> <p>But he also accused some of the cruise ship companies of misleading authorities about the health of people onboard. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that some of the companies have been lying about the situation of the health of passengers and crew onboard, so what we\u2019ve agreed to do with NSW is to look at each of the vessels,\u201d he told 2GB radio.</p> <p>He said the approach might vary from ship to ship. \u201cSome of these ships will move off and go back to their port of origin, some of them we may be able to extract the crew and fly them back to their country of origin, some of them \u2013 because they\u2019ve been out there for more than 14 days \u2013 there\u2019s no presence of Covid-19 onboard. Others we do have concern about.\u201d</p> <p>Aspen Medical \u2013 a private company that has done work for Princess Cruises, owned by Carnival, in the past \u2013 will provide the medical staff.</p> <p>A company spokesman said: \u201cAspen Medical is operating at a high operational tempo, with a significant amount of work relating to the Covid-19 response, both at home and overseas, including establishing respiratory clinics, emergency departments, infection control training for health professionals and aged care staff and providing screening at Swissotel [Sydney].</p> <p>\u201cOur involvement in the Covid-19 cruise ship response began in Tokyo, where we managed the land-based quarantine facility for the crew of the Diamond Princess. Following the success of that operation, we were contracted to undertake similar work onboard the Grand Princess off San Francisco,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The details of the contract with Australian Border Force in relation to cruise ships off the coast was being finalised now, he said.</p> <p> The Maritime Union of Australia has urged the federal government to urgently repatriate all crew members, other than those directly responsible for marine operations, to address the growing humanitarian crisis.</p> <p>That would mean bringing crews onshore and organising charter flights to countries such as Philippines, India and China, where many of the crew originate.</p> <p>But the presence of the novel coronavirus will potentially open up a legal quagmire, particularly if the captains of the ship declare their ships in distress or refuse to leave Australian waters. There may also be difficulties getting countries to accept repatriated crew.</p> <p>Dutton said the Australian Border Force commissioner had already issued directions for a number of vessels to depart Australian waters \u201cand we\u2019re working through that with each of the companies now\u201d.</p> <p>But Dutton added: \u201cWe\u2019ve also got to be cautious about the fact that if you force these boats to set sail, and they end up having people die or people who are seriously sick by the time they get a couple of hundred nautical miles off the coast, they\u2019d turn around and come back. So we\u2019ve got to deal sensibly with each of them.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Labor has accused the federal government of pushing responsibility for dealing with the cruise ship crisis onto the states and called for Dutton, who has been recovering from Covid-19, to be replaced.</p> <p>Labor\u2019s home affairs spokesperson, Kristina Keneally, called on the federal government to take responsibility for solving the \u201ccomplex\u201d issues, saying they were beyond the capacity of any single jurisdiction to solve.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a border security crisis on our hands,\u201d she said. \u201cWe welcome the border measures that have come in in recent days but they\u2019ve come too late. More astoundingly, the commonwealth government, responsible for our borders, at the ports and airports, has handed the responsibility for quarantine measures to state governments.</p> <p>\u201cAfter trying to blame NSW for the Ruby Princess, the federal government has given NSW and Victoria, as well as all other states, the responsibility for implementing quarantine measures at our ports, airports and seaports.\u201d</p> <p>According to NSW Health, 464 cases of Covid-19 had been linked to various cruise ships in the state.</p> <p>The Ovation of the Seas has 74 positive cases, the Voyager of the Seas has 34 cases among passengers and five among crew, the Ruby Princess 337 among passengers and three among crew, and the Celebrity Solstice 11 cases. <br><br>On the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/anatomy-of-a-coronavirus-disaster-how-2700-people-were-let-off-the-ruby-princess-cruise-ship-by-mistake\">15 March, Morrison </a>said the federal government would not allow crew ships to arrive, but several cruise ships which had left Australia with predominantly Australian passengers onboard were permitted to land and disembark passengers.</p>",

He insisted these powers were time-limited but justified. </p> \n  <p>Russell said the extension to 60 days had been accepted by Daren Fitzhenry, the Scottish information commissioner, because of the exceptional impact the crisis was having on public bodies, many of whom had sent all their staff home, making it very hard to search files or collate responses.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e84d6358f0866297e9f537c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sarah-marsh\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-01T17:59:27.964Z\">6.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In the UK, health workers are making improvised masks out of snorkels, buying kit from hardware stores and using school science goggles to protect themselves in anticipation of a rise in coronavirus cases, it has emerged.</p> \n  <p>An NHS consultant anaesthetist working in south-east England reported buying 60 snorkels to adapt into respirator masks. \u201cVarious other places are doing the same,\u201d the doctor told the Guardian. \u201cOne trust has ordered 500 and teamed up with companies who are (3D) printing the adapters.\u201d<br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-ciAtVg-JS/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

At the end of the war in Spain he crossed the border into France where he was briefly interned before travelling to north Africa where he joined La Nueve.</p> \n  <p>La Nueve, the 9th Regiment de Marche du Tchad, part of the 2nd Armoured Division (Division Leclerc), was overwhelmingly made up of Spanish republican fighters who were among the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/07/picasso-exhibition-franco-spanish-civil-war\">500,000 Spaniards who fled across the border into France in 1939</a> as Franco\u2019s forces closed in on victory. One hundred and forty-six of the company\u2019s 160 men were Spanish and, despite serving in the French army, they were permitted to stitch the red-yellow-and-purple flag of Spain\u2019s second republic on to their uniforms. They were also allowed to paint the flag on their vehicles, which rolled into Paris emblazoned with names such as Guernica and Don Quichotte (Don Quixote). Spanish was the common language within the company. All had fought during the liberation of French north Africa. </p> \n  <p>The company, also known as La Espa\u00f1ola because of the number of Spanish soldiers, was the first to enter Paris on 24 August 1944. While awaiting the surrender of the German governor of occupied Paris, La Nueve troops were sent to occupy public buildings and those taken over by the German military command as well as Place de la Concorde. </p> \n  <p>Allied troops led by GenCharles de Gaulle entered Paris the following day. More than 50 members of La Nueve received the Croix de Guerre for bravery.</p> \n  <p>La Nueve\u2019s contribution to the liberation of Paris has only recently been recognised.
