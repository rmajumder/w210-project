On Monday, the country posted 8,926 new cases, the lowest in weeks.</p> \n  <p>But concerns about the actual death toll of the disease have grown amid worrying reports from Dagestan and several other regions of hundreds of deaths from pneumonia, many of whom may have been infected with coronavirus but not tallied due to Russia\u2019s conservative autopsy standards. The country has tallied just 2,722 deaths from the disease.</p> \n  <p>The health minister of Dagestan, a southern Russian region of nearly three million people, said on Sunday that while officially 29 people in the republic had died of Covid-19, another 657 people had died of \u201ccommunity-acquired pneumonia,\u201d a sickness often contracted by those infected with coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>He also confirmed that more than 40 medics in Dagestan had died since the coronavirus crisis began, a concern that had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/painful-to-see-rise-in-russian-medics-falling-prey-to-covid-19-as-death-toll-questioned\">raised concerns across Russia</a>, but claimed that many had died of causes other than coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>Other regions also appeared to indicate that death rates from pneumonia were many times higher than from coronavirus. The St. Petersburg governor also announced late last week that 694 people had died from pneumonia since 1 March, while just 63 people had officially died of coronavirus and been added to Russia\u2019s tally of deaths from the disease.</p> \n  <p>Russia\u2019s mortality rate from the disease is considerably lower than other countries with more than 100,000 infections. The Kremlin has said that is attributable to the country\u2019s medical system, while critics have noted that deaths are tallied differently than in most countries in Europe and North America. New data from Moscow last week indicated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/coronavirus-russia-defends-its-exceptionally-precise-covid-19-death-data\">nearly 1,600 people with coronavirus</a> had died since the outbreak began, but that just 639 were included on official death tolls from the disease after autopsies found other causes of death.</p> \n  <p>Many academics believe that excess death rates are the best way to evaluate the total death toll from the disease.

the situation is stabilising. </p> \n  <p>Health officials reported 8,926 new infections in the last 24 hours, bringing the country\u2019s total to 290,678, the second-highest in the world after the <strong>United States</strong>. </p> \n  <p>It was the lowest number of new virus cases since 1 May, when Russia announced 7,933 cases. </p> \n  <p>Russia\u2019s consumer health watchdog chief,

At least 315,187<strong> </strong>people have died over the course of the pandemic The number of deaths in the US is approaching 90,000, with 89,562 confirmed fatalities and 1,486,757 infections, according to the Johns Hopkins university tracker.</li> \n   <li><strong>US Federal Reserve Chair says unemployment could reach 25%. </strong>US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Sunday that US unemployment could peak at 25%, but expressed optimism that the economy could begin to recover from a devastating recession in the second half of the year, assuming the coronavirus doesn\u2019t erupt in a second wave.</li> \n   <li><strong>Japan </strong><strong>falls into recession. </strong>Japan dived into its first recession since 2015, according to official data on Monday, with the world\u2019s third-largest economy contracting by 0.9% in the first quarter as it wrestled with the fallout from the coronavirus. The cabinet office reported a drop of 3.4% annual pace in seasonally adjusted real gross domestic product, or GDP, the total value of a nation\u2019s goods and services, for the January-March period, compared with the previous quarter.</li> \n   <li><strong>South Africa reports highest daily increase in cases. </strong>South Africa on Sunday reported 1,160 new coronavirus infections, the highest daily number since the first case was recorded in March \u201cAs of today, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in South Africa is 15,515, with 1,160 new cases identified in the last 24 hour cycle of testing,\u201d the health ministry said in a statement.

Brazil has the fourth-highest number of infections worldwide, with 241,080, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. It has recorded 16,118 deaths. Meanwhile, Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro greeted hundreds of supporters and joined some in a series of push-ups who gathered before the presidential offices Sunday.</li> \n   <li><strong>Death tolls fall in UK, Spain and Italy. </strong>In a possible glimmer of hope, Sunday saw lower death tolls reported in the UK, Spain and Italy. The UK\u2019s daily coronavirus death toll was the lowest since lockdown began, with 170 deaths recorded. However, the Sunday and Monday figures tend to be lower than other days because of weekend testing rates. Meanwhile, Spain<strong> </strong>recorded its lowest single-day death toll in two months. Italy on Sunday recorded its lowest daily toll, 145, since lockdown was declared. There were 153 deaths registered during the previous 24 hour period.</li> \n   <li><strong>Move Rohingya on Bangladesh island to refugee camps, says UN chief. </strong>Hundreds of Rohingya rescued by Bangladesh and sent to a flood-prone island after being stranded at sea for weeks should be moved to existing refugee camps, the UN secretary general has said. </li> \n   <li><strong>WHO committee to discuss Taiwan exclusion. </strong>The World Health Organization (WHO) is to raise the question of Taiwan\u2019s participation as an observer at the World Health Assembly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/world-health-assembly-what-is-it-and-what-is-the-coronavirus-inquiry-china-taiwan-origins\">which opens virtually on Monday</a>, before one of its committees. Diplomatic allies of Taiwan, including Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Paraguay, have formally requested to invite Taiwan to the meeting as an observer. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has also said publicly he wants Taiwan in the room.</li> \n   <li><strong>India extends lockdown by another two weeks. </strong>India has extended its lockdown to 31 May, but with some easing of restrictions. States are being given greater power to reopen markets and standalone stores, bus and other public transport travel being allowed between and within states.

The UK\u2019s daily coronavirus death toll was the lowest since lockdown began, with 170 deaths recorded. This should be taken with a pinch of salt: due to hospital reporting delays, the numbers reported on Sundays and Mondays tend to be lower than other days. Meanwhile Spain<strong> </strong>has recorded its lowest single-day death toll in two months. Italy on Sunday recorded its lowest daily toll, 145, since lockdown was declared.

Both routes require the applicant to accrue 65 points to move.</p>\n    <p>Points comes from a range of factors, among them:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li><b>Age: </b>These range from 25 points for those aged 18-24, to zero if you are over 50.&nbsp;</li>\n     <li><b>English language skills: </b>People receive 20 points for 'superior' skills, ten for proficient, and none for 'competent'.</li>\n     <li><b>Work experience: </b>More time in a particular occupation brings more points, with experience in Australia counting more than that from overseas.</li>\n     <li><b>Qualifications: </b>Again, higher qualifications bring more points, up to 20 for a doctorate.</li>\n     <li><b>Relevant skills: </b>Gaining entry requires your jobs to be on the so-called skilled occupation list, a lengthy collection of jobs with shortages, and various classes of visa for which such a job allows people to apply.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Some critics of the Australian system argue it is a blunt tool, and that the strict points-based criteria can mask other skills and qualities. The cap can also cover a significant backlog in processing people.

The Mensa-botherers among you may have deduced that, with this being a liveblog about a match between Werder Bremen and Bayer Leverkusen, the answer is likely to be either a) Werder Bremen or b) Bayer Leverkusen.</p> <p>This is the 57th season since the Bundesliga was introduced in 1963-64. Bremen have been involved in 56 of them, one more than Bayern Munich and Hamburger SV. They\u2019ve won it four times, too, so it\u2019s pretty shocking to see the mess they\u2019re in. (You may not have been aware of this mess until two minutes ago, but it\u2019s okay: we\u2019re all Bundesliga experts now.) </p> <p>Bremen are second from bottom, have been for a while. They are nine points off complete safety and five off a relegation play-off place. And while they have two games in hand, one of them tonight, their points-per-game ratio so far this season suggests those matches are worth precisely 1.5 points.</p> <p>They have a tough game tonight against a Leverkusen side whose form between the winter break and spring break was almost as good as Bayern Munich\u2019s. It\u2019s probably too late for a title challenge but they are are right in contention for next season\u2019s Champions League. Leverkusen have some outstanding young players, including Jonathan Tah, Leon Bailey and <em>the </em>Kai Havertz, who may fill in up front in the absence of the injured Kevin Volland.</p> <p>Bremen might benefit from the lack of a home crowd, because their form at the Weserstadion has been abysmal. They haven\u2019t won a Bundesliga game there since the start of September; they haven\u2019t even drawn one since the start of November. Not even a two-month absence due to a global pandemic can polish those statistics.<br></p> <p><strong>Kick off </strong>7.30pm BST, 8.30pm CET.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-18T17:22:00.072Z\">at 6.22pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

Companies wanting to resume construction, mining and manufacturing activities could apply for permission starting Monday, Amlo said.</p> <p>But the move to reopen the economic comes amid an ongoing row over the scale of Mexico\u2019s coronavirus crisis. Amlo has been infuriated by a string of stories in foreign media outlets alleging that his government has undercounted Covid-19 deaths.</p> <p>Amlo returned to the theme at his daily press conference on Monday, accusing international media of wanting to damage his government and spreading disinformation.</p> <p>Physicians and public health experts express disquiet that the country is opening too quickly and the model used to guide Mexico\u2019s Covid-19 response is unable to produce granular information for knowing which municipalities to open.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re at the peak and this peak could last a week or two weeks or who knows how long.

  "<p>You can\u2019t fault Matt Hancock\u2019s Stakhanovite work ethic. Barely a day has gone by without him being sent out on to the government frontline. But the effort is clearly beginning to take its toll. In the past few weeks his normal Tiggerish enthusiasm and goodwill to all has given way to something rather more vulnerable. A man who feels himself not just under attack from a country that wonders why the health secretary hasn\u2019t done rather more to protect the nation\u2019s health, but also from the prime minister and cabinet colleagues who have been lining him up as the scapegoat in the inevitable public inquiry.</p> <p>The initial sign that Matt was not coping so well was in his snappiness. His tetchiness with MPs and members of the media whenever his version of events was challenged. Now though it\u2019s looking as if Hancock is moving through the denial and anger stages of grief toward the bargaining and depression stages.</p> <p>There\u2019s still a way to go before he comes to any form of acceptance but now there is a discernible sadness to his public performances. An emotional fragility that can barely be kept at bay. Other people\u2019s anger he can just about deal with. It\u2019s their compassion that will get him in the end. The Dear Matt text in which he is dumped with the words, \u201cIt\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p> <p>For his Commons coronavirus statement, it was all Matt could do to hold it together for an hour. Hardly surprising as he knows better than anyone that much of what he\u2019s saying is pure fantasy. Though the truth might set him free, he\u2019s just not quite ready for the admission of failure. So he began as if the coronavirus was a mild inconvenience, rather than the worst public health crisis for 100 years.</p> <p>We\u2019d passed the peak \u2013 please, no one tell him about the probability of a second wave \u2013 and by and large everything was totally in control. The government had done brilliantly, hospitals had coped and NHS mental health services were there for anyone who needed them. Provided they were able to wait six months without falling apart completely for a referral to a professional.</p> <p>Care homes had had a protective ring thrown round them from the very start of the pandemic. As a description of the government\u2019s handling of the crisis it could hardly have been more inaccurate. But this wasn\u2019t about the public. It was about throwing a protective ring around Matt\u2019s psyche. This was as close to reality as he could bring himself to get.</p> <p>There were a few new announcements. From now on anosmia \u2013 a lack of smell or taste \u2013 would be added to a persistent dry cough and high temperature as coronavirus symptoms. And anyone with any of these symptoms could now get a test if they could log on to the NHS website and find a testing station with capacity to see them. Best of all, Matt was able to report that he had beaten his target of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/17/uk-contact-tracing-applicants-wrongly-told-hiring-paused-in-latest-misstep\">recruiting 18,000 tracers</a> \u2013 he didn\u2019t know if they were yet trained \u2013 and now had 21,000 people on the books. Though given Hancock\u2019s dodgy record on false accounting, it was quite possible that some of the new recruits may have been counted twice.</p> <p>Some politicians believe you need to be cruel to be kind. Labour\u2019s shadow health secretary, John Ashworth, takes the opposite view and is kind to be cruel. He\u2019s long since stopped being angry with Hancock over the government\u2019s mishandling of the crisis and now just talks to him like an awkward teenager in whom he\u2019s disappointed. It had been a bit late to include anosmia, hadn\u2019t it? There hadn\u2019t always been a protective ring around care homes, had there? And what was the point in easing lockdown restrictions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/phone-app-delay-raises-concerns-about-easing-lockdown-on-1-june\">before there was a comprehensive test and trace system up and running</a> to replace them?</p> <p>Matt was now on the verge of breaking down. His eyes bloodshot as he tried to hold it together. Pleading for one last chance to make the relationship work. There was definitely a protective ring around care homes. Things would change. Get better, he promised. Having already forgotten that his new test and trace operation was supposed to have kicked in two days ago. Just one last chance, he pleaded.</p> <p>\u201cWe are ready and preparing,\u201d he said, apparently unaware that the two were mutually exclusive. You\u2019re either ready or you\u2019re preparing. A few Tory backbenchers tried to put a socially-distanced arm around him and reassure him he was doing OK, but most just melted away. Matt left the chamber alone. Hopefully to have a long sob in private. He might just find it cathartic.</p> <p>Fifteen minutes later, Priti Patel made a rare public appearance as she reintroduced her immigration bill. Most of us have long since concluded that the home secretary has been kept hidden because she is fundamentally useless. But now some MPs were wondering if she might not also have had the coronavirus. Because there was a total lack of taste in announcing plans to keep low-paid overseas workers out of the country, when they are doing more than most to keep the NHS, care homes and food deliveries running.</p> <p>Still, Patel did want to pay a small tribute to those doing jobs she considers unskilled. Not least because she has also proved that being home secretary is low-skilled work. So, as a compromise, she proposed that everyone should continue clapping key workers at 8pm on a Thursday. Just to help them on their way to the deportation centre. She\u2019s all heart, Priti.</p>",
  "<p>Michael O\u2019Leary has always been willing to conduct more than one fight at a time, but the Ryanair chief executive, who seems in danger of exploding with fury every time he speaks at the moment, may be well-advised to calm down and deploy smarter tactics.</p> <p>For starters, his outrage over \u201cstate-aid dopers\u201d, as he calls Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and others, is unlikely to achieve much. Alitalia was being bailed out quietly by the Italian government even before Covid-19 arrived, so the chances of persuading the EU to jump on multiple instances of \u201cillegal\u201d state-aid are roughly zero.</p> <p>Ryanair\u2019s own \u00a3600m loan via the Bank of England\u2019s coronavirus lending facility falls into a different bracket, O\u2019Leary argued, because the scheme is not sector-specific and is generally available to credit-worthy borrowers. That\u2019s true, but don\u2019t expect the distinction to cut much ice with EU regulators. However unfair it is, flag-carrying airlines have always been treated differently.</p> <p>O\u2019Leary\u2019s other rant about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/18/ryanair-chief-michael-oleary-uk-mismanaging-coronavirus-crisis\">\u201cidiotic\u201d nature of the UK government\u2019s 14-day quarantine plan</a> will enjoy some popular support among would-be holidaymakers, but the audience Ryanair would surely prefer to influence is government itself. Ministers, after all, will make the rules, not Ryanair.</p> <p>O\u2019Leary may help himself by sounding more constructive. Here\u2019s an idea: since \u201cnot sure\u201d and \u201chope for the best\u201d Covid cases could be most dangerous in spreading the virus in airports and on planes, Ryanair could offer a refund to any passenger, and member of their family, who feels even mildly ill in the days before a flight.</p> <p>No-quibble refunds are not Ryanair\u2019s normal style, but an effort in that direction would show more seriousness than the current exercise in throwing insults.</p> <h2>Debt nightmare? Boot it Intu the long grass</h2> <p>The beleaguered board of Intu, the over-borrowed owner of shopping centres, has thought long and hard (again) about how to resolve a \u00a34.5bn debt nightmare and here\u2019s its latest idea: boot the problem Intu the long grass.</p> <p>The \u201cupdate on lender discussions\u201d was really a proposal not to hold meaningful discussions for a while. The owner of the Trafford Centre near Manchester, the Metrocentre in Gateshead, Lakeside in Essex, and others is seeking a standstill arrangement that would allow it to operate on a \u201cpay if you can\u201d basis with lenders until the end of 2021.</p> <p>In other words, covenant tests on borrowings, which the company is at severe risk of failing in June, would be waived and everybody would pledge to revisit the mess another day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is no guarantee all lenders will play ball, of course. Intu is a complex financial construction and has many flavours of lenders \u2013 everything from high street banks to hedge funds. But the board will probably get most of what it wants since it is impossible to round up buyers for large malls, as Hammerson proved when a sale of seven centres collapsed this month. Most lenders don\u2019t want to take control of acres of retail space.</p> <p>Prepare, then, for another round of \u201cextend and pretend\u201d. It may make short-term sense at Intu, but a delayed restructuring adds another layer of uncertainty to valuations across the retail property sector. Nobody knows what anything is worth \u2013 and the answers are likely to take ages to arrive.</p> <h2>HIV vaccine points to improvements at GSK</h2> <p>An encouraging Covid vaccine trial by the US group Moderna pushed stock markets everywhere higher on Monday, but there was a medical breakthrough on a different front closer to home. GlaxoSmithKline said its trial to develop a two-monthly injection to prevent HIV infection has shown excellent results.</p> <p>This could be very big news for GSK, which is strong in HIV treatment but has been eclipsed in prevention by the US group Gilead, whose Truvada daily pill generates sales of about $2.5bn a year. GSK said a trial of its cabotegravir medicine had been stopped three years early because the data were so good \u2013 69% more effectiveness than Truvada.</p> <p>The result seems to have been way beyond GSK\u2019s expectations and could mean approval for cabotegravir in the US and Europe later this year. It is just one treatment and nothing can ever be taken for granted in drug development \u2013 but it\u2019s another piece of evidence that the long-promised improvement in productivity in GSK\u2019s labs may finally be happening.</p>",
  "<p>Why is the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/18/tories-accused-of-hypocrisy-over-key-workers-with-immigration-bill\" title=\"\">pressing ahead</a> with an immigration policy that was designed for a world that no longer exists? Brexit\u2019s strident rhetoric posited falsehoods about migrant workers being behind depressed wages, housing shortages and stressed public services. But that was before coronavirus. Many Britons have woken up now to the fact that vital sectors in the NHS, social care and food production have been kept going by low-paid EU and non-European workers of the kind whose numbers the home secretary, Priti Patel, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52701843\" title=\"\">plans</a> to restrict.</p> <p>Ms Patel\u2019s immigration bill claims it is introducing a points-based system, but it is more an income-based one. She proposes to end freedom of movement from the EU and apply the same salary threshold and skills requirement to prospective migrants wherever they come from. The rules are due to take effect in January and it is estimated that <a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/news-and-media/press-releases/immigration-plans-analysis-two-thirds-of-current-eu-migrants-in-health-and-care-sector-would-have-been-found-ineligible\" title=\"\">two-thirds</a> of EU migrants now classed as key workers would not qualify for a work visa next year. The bill fails because the crisis has shown that salary alone is a poor guide to a person\u2019s value to society.</p> <p>The political argument for a tough regime is also fading. The public was warming to immigration before the pandemic struck and there was outrage over the injustice perpetuated on a generation of Caribbean migrants in the Windrush scandal. Polls show <a href=\"https://twitter.com/britishfuture/status/1262389476128690176?s=20\" title=\"\">widespread public sympathy</a> for low-paid foreign employees in the NHS and care sector.</p> <p>The economic case for revisiting the policy is even stronger. The coming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/13/uk-economy-shrank-2-in-first-quarter-record-monthly-plunge-ons-cfovid-19-lockdown-gdp\" title=\"\">recession</a> is unlikely to make Britain attractive to migrants. Travel is also probably going to remain restricted, limiting the scope to find work. Foreign students, the lifeblood of many universities and the towns that house them, will not rush back to Britain. The disruption to travel is expected to be lasting: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52436741\" title=\"\">Airbus has cut plane production by a third</a>. It\u2019s hard to see the sense in continuing with a bill to limit immigration when the shutdown has done that anyway.</p> <p>In an era of high unemployment, jobs that British workers have been able to choose not to do might be more attractive than they previously were. There has been a jump in applications to <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2020-04-28/surge-in-applications-to-work-for-nhs-during-pandemic/\" title=\"\">work in the NHS</a> during the pandemic. The government will need to put more money into training and pay. It is obvious why there are so few local workers in social care when \u2013 after a decade of local government austerity \u2013 hourly pay in a largely private sector is lower than in <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/blog/2019/08/average-pay-for-care-workers\" title=\"\">supermarkets</a>.</p> <p>Ms Patel ought to be generous and relax the proposed restrictions. She could do so without incurring political cost, as polls show support to exempt lower-paid frontline migrant workers. She did not take the opportunity in the Commons on Monday. This was a mistake. It is also wrong for Ms Patel to force foreign health staff to <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/priti-patel-nhs-fees-foreign-health-staff-immigration-surcharge-a9517356.html\" title=\"\">pay extra to fund the NHS</a>. Large-scale immigration changes rarely work as intended \u2013 and one this size delivered in just seven months looks no different. Labour\u2019s Nick Thomas-Symonds was right to caution that widening the scope of ministerial sway over immigration amounted to an executive power grab.</p> <p>A blitzkrieg advance by ministers over immigration would be expected after Brexit, which remains the glue that holds Boris Johnson\u2019s government together. But the Covid-19 pandemic has made the public understandably fearful. When people are anxious they tend to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/mutual-aid-coronavirus-pandemic-rebecca-solnit\" title=\"\">re-evaluate their beliefs</a>. The shock of the virus has opened the political conversation to ideas beyond Brexit about what sort of society will work for all. For the sake of the country, the government ought to embrace them.</p>",

It went on for longer than usual, and covered a wide range of topics. Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Downing Street has played down prospects of its new contact tracing system being up and running nationwide this month. </strong>The system is being piloted in the Isle of Wight. At one point Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said that he wanted to have the whole system up and running by the middle of May. But, when the prime minister\u2019s spokesman was asked when it would be fully operational, he just said that this would happen \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said that 17,000 contact tracers were already in place and that the government was \u201cvery confident\u201d of getting the numbers up to 18,000 by the end of this week, as planned</strong>. The contact tracers are getting a range of training, he said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>A decision is likely this week as to whether the government will go ahead with plans for some primary school pupils in England to start going back on 1 June (a fortnight today), the spokesman signalled.</strong> The UK government\u2019s coronavirus recovery plan said Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 pupils would go back \u201cno earlier than Monday 1 June\u201d. The spokesman confirmed that this was still the position, but he accepted that 1 June (the Monday after half term, for many pupils) remained an ambition. Asked when the government would be able to say if this would be the date, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>You can see from the discussions that have taken place ... that we are working to seek to resolve this as soon as we can.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>When it was put to him that in practice this meant a decision this week, because next week is half term, the spokesman did not challenge this assumption. He said that the safety of pupils came first, but that the government was also aware of the damage being done to children from their not being in education.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said the government would publish its scientific advice about the safety of children being in school \u201cas soon as possible\u201d.</strong> On Friday the government published<a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/885631/Overview_of_scientific_advice_and_information_on_coronavirus_COVID19.pdf\"> an overview on this topic (pdf)</a>, he said. But the teaching unions want to see the full scientific advice. Asked when they would get it, the spokesman said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The Sage [Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies] papers are being published in batches, and the DfE papers will be published as soon as possible.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The government does not necessarily need to have its new contact tracing system operational nationwide for it to move to the \u201cstep two\u201d stage of the lockdown relaxation measures set out in its plan, the spokesman suggested.</strong> He said various factors would be taken into account before the government moved to step two, such as the reproduction number. But he said the government had not made having the contact tracing system up and running an essential condition.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The quarantine rules being imposed on new arrivals to the UK will be reviewed every three weeks, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said. </strong>He confirmed that the government is planning to issue more details of how the scheme will work \u201cin due course\u201d. But when the quarantine rules are introduced, they will be \u201csubject to rolling review every three weeks\u201d, the spokesman said, to ensure that they are in line with the latest scientific advice. That suggests that they will be reviewed in parallel with the existing lockdown regulations, which also have to be reviewed every three weeks. Those rules are next being reviewed on 28 May.

When Johnson announced the rules were being relaxed in his TV address, he was criticised for not being more explicit about how this only applied to England.

  "<p>Waves of panic radiate from the government. Each day ministers sent out to steady the ship in press conferences and broadcast studios tip it a bit closer to capsizing. Asking Michael Gove to soothe the teachers on Sunday with his, \u201cTeachers will be safe in schools\u201d line was about as reassuring to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2013/oct/02/michael-gove-referring-to-the-blob\">those he </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2013/oct/02/michael-gove-referring-to-the-blob\">called \u201cthe blob\u201d</a> as <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062803/characters/nm0375818\">Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062803/characters/nm0375818\">Child Catcher</a> summoning children from their cellars.

But daily, they <a href=\"https://twitter.com/devisridhar/status/1261580396833226752\">blow </a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/devisridhar/status/1261580396833226752\">their credibility away</a>.</p> <p>Paralysis during their leader\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/boris-johnson-moved-to-intensive-care-after-his-condition-worsens\">brush with death</a> has given way since his return to alarm at their helmsman\u2019s zigzag steering. His 13-minute <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/may/10/boris-johnsons-address-on-next-phase-of-coronavirus-lockdown-watch-in-full\">address to the nation</a> did more to hole the ship than buoy it in public opinion. No efforts were made to ease in his new back-to-work message. Without consulting teachers, care home managers, mayors or leaders of the other nations, of course he <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2020/05/15/what-do-voters-make-new-lockdown-measures\">faced a backlash</a>. Stay alert? It hasn\u2019t exactly tripped off ministerial tongues since then.</p> <p>Boris Johnson swept to power on brilliant messaging, his spinners turning straw to electoral gold with \u201cTake back control\u201d and \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d, but all that\u2019s gone. He likes to be liked, yet approval ratings are tumbling: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/17/as-lockdown-consensus-unravels-boris-johnson-divides-nation-and-party\">Opinium polls</a> showed a +42 net approval rating for his handling of the virus in March; that has fallen to -3. YouGov\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SamCoatesSky/status/1261945246453293056\">+51 net approval rating</a> on 27 March has plunged to -2. Keir Starmer\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/keir-starmer-approval-rating-boris-johnson-first-time-a4438786.html\">personal rating</a> overtook Johnson\u2019s last week. The government was sent into a flat spin by Starmer\u2019s trouncing of Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/13/pmqs-keir-starmer-presses-boris-johnson-over-care-home-deaths\">at prime minister\u2019s questions</a> over the appalling care home death rates.</p> <p>Fresh from a mega-victory and an age from the next election, why should the government panic? Because serial bungles, missteps, policy reversals and a vanishing connection with honesty risk damaging it beyond repair. No one knows all the right numbers yet, but trust shrinks when the government misuses them anyway. After Prof Tim Spector <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/weird-hell-professor-advent-calendar-covid-19-symptoms-paul-garner\">warned</a> that Britain\u2019s failure to list all 14 primary symptoms of the virus meant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/uk-coronavirus-tests-advised-for-people-who-lose-taste-or-smell\">between 50,000 and 70,000</a> people with Covid-19 were wrongly not being told to self-isolate, the government dashed to add \u201closs of sense of smell\u201d to its official list of symptoms. But expressing uncertainty is alien to ministers who were selected for an absolutist Brexit cast of mind.</p> <p>One report last week said that Johnson had warned the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers that they faced an agile opposition and a \u201c<a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/opinion/columnists/boris-johnson-analysis-1922-committee-tory-mps-coronavirus-crisis-2855468\">slippery opponent</a>\u201d. How revealing: there\u2019s nothing slippery about Starmer. But Johnson, captain of the chancers with his hand-picked crew of fly-by-nights, fibbers and fabricators, fears being shown up in unflattering contrast to Labour\u2019s frontbench of serious, earnest policy heavyweights. Politics is not a game for them, as it always has been for Johnson, but he\u2019s bereft when his old bluster can\u2019t beguile away deaths.</p> <p>Trust is ebbing away just when it\u2019s most needed to persuade anxious parents to send their children to school; it\u2019s frittered away on slippery pledges made to fill front pages for a day, but that are bound to be exposed soon after. We could walk down the well-trodden path: the government tacking wildly between herd immunity, tracking and tracing, then neither tracking nor testing, then locking down, then relaxing it but only to visit estate agents and garden centres, but not family. \u201cOnly following the science,\u201d ministers claim, or as one wit put it, the political science. But they get that political science badly askew.</p> <p>Take Matt Hancock\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SkyNews/status/1261329991708684294\">dumbfounding claim</a> on Friday: \u201cRight from the start we\u2019ve tried to throw a protective ring around our care homes \u2026 we\u2019ve made sure care homes have the resources they need.\u201d What sentient voter doesn\u2019t know that to be a flat-out lie? No testing and no PPE, as care homes \u2013 some close to bankruptcy \u2013 were pressured to take untested, possibly infected, hospital patients, without enough doctors, staff, training or isolation space. Taking the public for fools destroys trust.</p> <p>No government could have been fully ready as the tsunami of horror swept in. No reasonable voter would have expected everything to have been waiting, just in case. True, a decade of cuts had left us exceptionally unprepared and the government preferred failed private companies to handle PPE, testing and tracing over better equipped local authorities. Yet it might have kept the public\u2019s trust with honesty and transparency, consulting everyone, publishing everything, admitting failures.</p> <p>But on it goes, the absurd targets missed and lied about, graphs of global comparisons hastily dropped. Hancock promises all staff and residents of care homes <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52684700\">will be tested</a> by early June \u2013 but will that be every week, with prompt results?</p> <p>\u201cFollowing the science\u201d often means ducking behind the scientists to let them take the flak: Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, and Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, are, after all, civil servants, not independent. The most hapless figure giving cover to ministers has been the deputy chief medical officer for England, Jenny Harries. Before lockdown she <a href=\"https://www.shropshirestar.com/news/uk-news/2020/03/11/uk-is-following-the-science-in-not-banning-mass-gatherings-health-chief/\">backed </a><a href=\"https://www.shropshirestar.com/news/uk-news/2020/03/11/uk-is-following-the-science-in-not-banning-mass-gatherings-health-chief/\">Johnson\u2019s plan</a> not to ban large gatherings, noting: \u201cWe\u2019ve looked at what sorts of interventions might help manage this as we go forward, push the peak of the epidemic forward, and in general, those sorts of events and big gatherings are not seen to be something which is going to have a big effect. So we don\u2019t want to disrupt people\u2019s lives.\u201d She <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/uk-governments-coronavirus-response-beset-by-mixed-messages-and-u-turns\">defended</a> a fatal halt to tracking and tracing: \u201cThere comes a point in a pandemic where that is not an appropriate intervention.\u201d She <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/19/uk-coronavirus-live-lifting-lockdown-restrictions-boris-johnson-death-tollcovid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e9c70008f080ee110447c85\">called</a> the UK \u201can international exemplar in preparedness\u201d and told doctors to have a \u201cmore adult\u201d conversation about the lack of PPE. She <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BenKentish/status/1260699964784750598\">reiterated advice</a> that it was \u201cvery unlikely\u201d care homes would be infected.</p> <p>This government of world-class spinners and top-dollar public opinion manipulators are learning nothing: on Friday Hancock\u2019s disingenuous figures on how many tests had been carried out \u2013 almost double the number of individuals actually tested \u2013 were <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCRealityCheck/status/1261338261236019202\">instantly tripped up</a> by the BBC\u2019s Reality Check. As trust evaporates, why keep setting new targets the government will miss?</p> <p>Politicians in a panic grab for two life rafts: internal fall guys and public enemies. Internally cabinet secretary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/14/no-10-under-pressure-as-it-is-revealed-whitehall-chief-mark-sedwill-had-coronavirus\">Mark Sedwill</a> is taking a beating, while Hancock protests it\u2019s not fair he\u2019s being blamed. But finding public enemies is their favourite of the two. Despite a surge of public appreciation, the BBC is battered in the rightwing press. Teachers were set up for the enemy role, and are being bounced into opening schools at an arbitrary date. Gove extols the Danes for a smooth reopening: they did it with extensive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/17/denmark-can-teach-england-safe-reopening-of-schools-covid-19\">union consultation</a>. When the British Medical Association <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/bma-backs-teaching-unions-in-opposing-reopening-of-schools\">backed the teachers</a>, doctors came under attack: that certainly won\u2019t end well.</p> <p>Local authorities and the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish administrations are as ever cast as enemies, too, with none of them consulted. But if \u201clevelling up\u201d is still Johnson\u2019s aim, councils ask why extra funds are flowing to richer places rather than poorer ones \u2013 for example, to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndyBurnhamGM/status/1261922521177260034/photo/1\">Wiltshire more than to Knowsley</a> on Merseyside. Sadiq Khan, meanwhile, is the Tories\u2019 favoured regular enemy, as they force him to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/14/london-faces-bus-and-train-cuts-without-urgent-funding\">raise</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/14/london-faces-bus-and-train-cuts-without-urgent-funding\"> public transport fares</a> in London.</p> <p>But political aggression towards public servants is as tin-eared a response to public sentiment as Priti Patel\u2019s refusal to lift the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/16/home-office-priti-patel-failure-to-scrap-nhs-migrant-surcharge-sparks-anger\">\u00a36</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/16/home-office-priti-patel-failure-to-scrap-nhs-migrant-surcharge-sparks-anger\">25-a-year NHS surcharge</a> on foreign health and care staff for the privilege of caring for us: doesn\u2019t she hear the clapping? Brexit negotiations heading for no deal are, ministers hope, a winner \u2013 but they may not succeed in hiding chaos at the ports and a fall in GDP amid the coronavirus economic crisis.</p> <p>Everything about this low-grade, callow crew makes them the most unfit government in living memory to cope with this great crisis. Rishi Sunak has done well to spray the meltdown with money, but his real test is still to come. For the rest, they learn nothing from their errors, eroding any trust in the notion that their prime motive might be serving the public\u2019s best interest, not saving their own skins. Boris Johnson looks an ever more inadequate figurehead for their floundering ship.</p> <p>\u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>My friend and colleague, Janek Alexander, who has died aged 61, was made vulnerable to Covid-19 by the impact of Parkinson\u2019s disease, with which he was diagnosed 18 years ago. </p> <p>While his career was inextricably linked with <a href=\"https://www.visitwales.com/things-do/culture/cultural-attractions/chapter-arts-centre-cardiffs-diverse-venue-and-art-house\">Chapter arts centre</a> in Cardiff, his influence spread throughout Wales because of his involvement with many key organisations and artists, and further afield through his significant role in the Informal European Theatre Meeting (IETM), a relationship that connected him with the wider European cultural sector. </p> <p>He also brought influential companies such as the New York based Wooster Group and the Japanese media collective, Dumbtype, to Cardiff audiences.</p> <p>Janek was born in Cardiff, the son of Kazimierz Baldy, a sales manager, and his wife, Eva (nee Hinckley), an NHS dialysis receptionist. After school in Cardiff, he studied philosophy and psychology at Warwick University, but his passion was the arts where he became an energetic \u201cmover and shaker\u201d.</p> <p>As a teenager, his early involvement with theatre was at the youth arts centre, Llanover Hall, where he first met theatre makers with whom he would be involved for the rest of his working life. He was already distinguishing himself \u2013 inquisitive, self-aware, eccentric, an artist in waiting. That artistry manifested in the late 1970s when he created eight original productions with his own company, Diamond Age. They were funny, intelligent and provocative, with his original songs and music, and many of us still cherish images from those works.</p> <p>In 1981 he took up the role of theatre programmer at Chapter, extending his sphere of influence to support burgeoning companies such as the Swansea-based Volcano and Ed Thomas\u2019s Y Cwmni, and the epic productions of Brith Gof.</p> <p>In 1996 he became director of Chapter, leading an ambitious programme of renovation that increased audiences and transformed Chapter into one of the best arts centres in Europe, while placing it more firmly at the heart of its community. Devoting his career to Chapter, he left only when ill-health forced him to retire in 2011.</p> <p>Janek was a singular character, a teetotaller and non-smoker. His eyes would light up at the prospect of a special pastry or ice-cream, wherever he was in the world. A man of few words \u2013 idiosyncratic, determined and visionary \u2013 he had a mordant sense of humour and a keen intellect. His passionate advocacy of the arts and artists in general, and Chapter in particular, is his legacy. </p> <p>He is survived by his brother, Marek, and his partner, Maxine Brown, who cared for him until the end.</p>",

  "<p>Andrew Bone was working as a truck driver for the <a href=\"https://www.icrc.org/en\">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> in 1993, distributing food and medicine to war-torn areas of Bosnia. At the end of the year, he flew to Sarajevo to cover for another staff member. \u201cIt was a desperate situation to fly into,\u201d he says. \u201cI was whisked straight up to the organisation\u2019s headquarters in a bullet-proof Land Rover.\u201d That\u2019s where he spotted Tanja Todorovic for the first time. \u201cI had this surge of adrenaline. I just felt that I had to get to know her. It sounds like a silly fairytale but it\u2019s true.\u201d</p> <p>At the time, Tanja was working as a senior field officer for the charity. Andrew got the chance to speak to her properly when they were sent to deliver aid to a home for people with learning disabilities. \u201cAndy was so kind to the people who lived there,\u201d says Tanja. \u201cHe was handsome too. All this long, blonde, curly hair. It\u2019s all gone now, of course,\u201d she laughs.</p> <p>Shortly afterwards, Tanja had to go to Pale for a work mission and asked Andrew to be her driver. \u201cThe road back was shelled while we were there,\u201d he says. \u201cWe ended up having to spend the night in Pale. We had drinks together and that\u2019s the night that we started our relationship.\u201d</p> <p>A couple of weeks later, Andrew\u2019s cover came to an end and he was sent back to Zagreb. \u201cI was distraught. I went to the radio room and begged the operators to let me talk to her.\u201d They told him it was impossible. \u201cEventually though they said they were nipping out for coffee and I was able to get hold of Tanja to tell her I loved her.\u201d</p> <p>Shortly afterwards, Tanja travelled to Zagreb to meet Andrew. \u201cI had a Red Cross passport, which meant I was able to travel out of the war zone,\u201d she explains. They discussed the future of their relationship and whether Tanja should return to Sarajevo. They knew they wanted to be together and had big decisions to make.</p> <p>The situation was complicated by the fact that they were both married at the time. \u201cMy marriage wasn\u2019t working out and Tanja was separated but it was really hard,\u201d says Andrew. \u201cBack then, Britain was sympathetic to refugees coming from Bosnia, so we decided it would be best to come here and be together, away from the war.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8b47a552c2fde9b888089ea86fad7ca5fb2abf49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b47a552c2fde9b888089ea86fad7ca5fb2abf49/0_0_1316_1895/694.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew and Tanja in 1994 in Reepham, Norfolk.\" width=\"694\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrew and Tanja in 1994 in Reepham, Norfolk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Provided by Tanja Bone</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tanja applied for asylum and the pair were able to marry at the end of 1994, once their divorces were finalised. \u201cI then got indefinite leave to remain and in 1999 I got my British citizenship,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Over the next 10 years, they moved around the UK, living in Norfolk, London, Leicester and Scotland. Andrew continued to work as a truck driver, while Tanja took on various roles including working for the <a href=\"https://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/\">Refugee Council</a> and launching an organic fruit and vegetable shop in Leicester.</p> <p>In 2004, she went back to university to train as a nurse and the couple moved to London. However, they soon realised they weren\u2019t ready to stop exploring. \u201cFrom 2009 to 2019, we travelled around the UK by boat, moving from place to place,\u201d says Tanja. They worked when they needed to and enjoyed their nomadic lifestyle.</p> <p>When Andrew became ill with cancer 18 months ago, they moved to a permanent base in Dumbarton, Scotland. \u201cI feel really lucky to have had such incredible care at the hands of the NHS. I had some surgery just before lockdown and they now think I am cancer-free,\u201d he says. Tanja is still working as a nurse, and the pair have been enjoying daily walks together. \u201cWe love the countryside here,\u201d says Tanja. \u201cWhen it\u2019s safe, we will go back to hiking in the Highlands.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s been 26 years since they met, but Andrew says he is more in love than ever. \u201cShe is my best friend and my everything.

  "<p>With support for Angela Merkel\u2019s governing coalition surging during the coronavirus pandemic, Germany\u2019s Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland, the largest opposition party in the Bundestag, has opted for a vicious bout of public infighting that could split the party in two.</p> <p>The national board of the anti-immigration AfD narrowly voted last Friday to strip party membership from Andreas Kalbitz, a key networker on the rabidly nationalist fringes of the party\u2019s eastern German branches.</p> <p>Kalbitz, a 47-year-old former professional soldier who heads the AfD in Brandenburg, was ousted over allegedly declining to inform the party of his former membership of a banned neo-Nazi group, German Youths Loyal to the Fatherland, when applying to join the party in 2013. He was last year also revealed to have been named by the German embassy in Athens as one of 14 neo-Nazis who travelled to the Greek capital in 2007 for a far-right rally.</p> <p>The AfD has struggled to formulate a coherent stance on the coronavirus and failed to leverage a grassroots anti-lockdown movement, and the expulsion of Kalbitz has caused a split through the party\u2019s leadership and set eastern against western delegates.</p> <p>The move was driven by J\u00f6rg Meuthen, an AfD co-leader from the party\u2019s middle-class libertarian wing. The former economics professor represents the kind of conservatives who founded the party in protest against Greek bailout payments in 2013, and who previously defended the more extremist positions held by its politicians in the formerly socialist east by claiming their radicalism was exaggerated by the media.</p> <p>But since the German domestic intelligence agency\u2019s designation in March of an AfD faction known as the Wing (Fl\u00fcgel) as a far-right extremist group warranting state surveillance, their alliance has been under strain.</p> <p>\u201cWe are a traditional conservative party,\u201d Meuthen told ARD public television. \u201cWe need to demonstrate cohesion but we also need to clearly distance ourselves from extreme-right positions.\u201d</p> <p>On Saturday night, the Thuringian party leader, Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, posted a video on Facebook in which he described the push to expel his ally Kalbitz as a \u201cpolitical act\u201d on behalf of Meuthen and a \u201cbetrayal\u201d. H\u00f6cke, who is seen as the figurehead of the AfD\u2019s nationalist <em><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/fascism/Intellectual-origins\">v\u00f6lkisch</a> </em>tendency, added: \u201cI won\u2019t allow the division and destruction of our party.\u201d</p> <p>Which side of the party will succeed in pushing out the other remains unclear. The AfD\u2019s other co-leader, Tino Chrupalla, and its two parliamentary leaders, Alice Weidel and Alexander Gauland, were reportedly against ousting Kalbitz, who has vowed to take legal action against his expulsion and on Monday announced he would stay on as a member of the AfD\u2019s delegation in the Brandenburg state parliament.</p> <p>To complicate proceedings further, the original 2013 membership application in which Kalbitz had allegedly failed to acknowledge his neo-Nazi past appears to have gone missing.</p> <p>The AfD has been the largest opposition force in Germany\u2019s parliament since the 2017 elections. But the party\u2019s fortunes have plummeted during the Covid-19 pandemic, with several recent polls putting its share of the vote below 10%.</p> <p>For Merkel the pandemic has prompted a political comeback. Her personal approval ratings have shot up on the back of a crisis management perceived as calm and competent, and her Christian Democratic Union party leads the polls on about 38% of the vote.</p> <p>The AfD, a populist outfit that in the past excelled at pinning the blame for complex geopolitical developments to single actors or ethnic groups, has wavered between accusing the Merkel government of shutting down the country\u2019s borders too late and accusing it of not lifting the lockdown earlier.</p> <p>On social media, Chrupalla has demanded a \u201creopening of the economy\u201d while simultaneously opposing proposed measures to control the spread of the coronavirus after lockdown restrictions are eased, such as contact tracing apps, immunity passports and mandatory vaccinations.</p> <p>The AfD has so far failed to exploit a burgeoning anti-lockdown protest movement that has brought together conspiracy theorists from the far right and the far left.</p> <p>In April, protest organisers claimed they had registered a new political party called Widerstand2020<em> </em>(\u201cResistance2020\u201d) with which they would seek to enter the Bundestag in 2021.</p>",

Most returnees have been placed in quarantine centres which are now at risk from the super-cyclone. The Odisha government said it would relocate thousands of migrant workers currently lodging in coastal quarantine centres.</p> <p>In Bangladesh, the super-cyclone is expected to cause heavy rains and possible flooding in the Cox\u2019s Bazar refugee camps, which are home to more than a million refugees. The camps reported their first case of Covid-19 last week. Aid agencies have warned it will be very difficult to contain there, and could have swift and disastrous consequences.</p> <p>Cyclone Amphan will be the first super-cyclonic storm to hit the region for more than 20 years.

And London is far from alone. In the past few weeks, thousands of miles of new bike lanes have been built in cities from Milan to Mexico City, huge swathes of residential streets in places from New York to Bogot\u00e1 are being closed to traffic, and experts say the dominance of the car is being seriously challenged for the first time in decades.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have no choice,\u201d said Norman. \u201cThis is not ideological opportunism. This is a necessity.\u201d</p> \n<p>The potential benefits of these changes are myriad.

  "<p>A Commonwealth-born veteran, who served for more than a decade in the British army including tours of Afghanistan and Iraq, has been told he must pay more than \u00a327,000 for NHS hospital bills after an emergency operation to remove a brain tumour.</p> <p>Hospital staff have classified Taitusi Ratucaucau, 49, as an overseas patient, and therefore ineligible for free NHS care. He joined the British army in 2001 and has been continuously in the UK since being discharged from the military in 2011, living here with his wife and three daughters, and paying tax and national insurance.</p> <p>Ratucaucau, originally from Fiji, is recovering in a London hospital after major brain surgery on 30 April. He is meant to be focusing on his physical rehabilitation but said he was spending most of his time worrying about how he would meet the demand for payment, given that he has no savings, is the main breadwinner for his family and is currently too unwell to work. The bill is increasing by around \u00a31,500 for every day he remains an inpatient.</p> <p>Ratucaucau is one of a group of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/08/commonwealth-veterans-accuse-uk-immigration-limbo-home-office-mod\">Commonwealth-born</a> military veterans who launched legal action against the Home Office and the Ministry of Defence earlier this year, over an alleged systemic failure to advise them of the need to apply for settlement in the UK on discharge and for failing to assist them with complex, expensive immigration rules.</p> <p>This has left them categorised as illegal immigrants, unable to access free NHS treatment, facing unemployment and homelessness and fearing deportation. They are unable to regularise their status owing to the cost and complexity of the immigration system.</p> <p>Since the issue was highlighted in the Guardian in March, more than 70 other veterans have come forward and military charities say <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/08/grave-injustice-fiji-british-army-veteran-immigration-limbo-uk\">hundreds</a> more are similarly affected. Coverage of their situation triggered public sympathy and widespread anger that Commonwealth <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/10/i-feel-betrayed-the-british-army-veteran-stuck-in-fiji-because-of-immigration-rules\">ex-servicemen</a> should need to pay thousands of pounds in visa fees to remain in the country they risked their lives for.</p> <p>Foreign national soldiers have the right to remain in the UK after leaving the army if they have served for at least four years, but claimants say they were discharged without being given clear guidance about how to regularise their immigration status. Most assumed the immigration process was automatic.</p> <p>On discharge from the army, Ratucaucau, who also served in Belize and the Falkland Islands, was given an \u201cexemplary\u201d conduct record and described as a \u201cvery capable, loyal and trustworthy individual\u201d with an \u201cimpeccable work ethic\u201d. He said he was given unclear advice, and was later unable to afford the cost of visas for himself, his wife and two older daughters, 13 and nine \u2013 who were born while the family were living in British military bases in Germany \u2013 which at that time was around \u00a35,000. Now he would need to pay \u00a32,389 for each applicant, a total of \u00a39,556 for the whole family to secure indefinite leave to remain here. His youngest daughter, eight, was born in the UK and does not need a visa.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1ca3baeb1251f09185c46f52d8171ca21a874e92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ca3baeb1251f09185c46f52d8171ca21a874e92/0_407_1000_1247/802.jpg\" alt=\"Taitusi Ratucaucau in hospital.\" width=\"802\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taitusi Ratucaucau in hospital.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Taitusi Ratucaucau</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He was unable to save enough to regularise his status during post-army jobs as a maintenance worker on the railways. More recently he has been working for a security company, which has also not paid enough to cover visas for his whole family.</p> <p>The mounting cost of his unexpected hospitalisation has left him distraught. \u201cWhere can I get money to pay for this treatment when I\u2019m in hospital?\u201d he asked, speaking by telephone from the rehabilitation ward. He said he had felt proud to be accepted into the British army, after officers visited Fiji to sign up new recruits in 2001. \u201cI gave up years of my life to fight for this country. We can\u2019t believe that the Home Office could be like this. I feel sad and angry.\u201d</p> <p>In a witness statement given to his lawyer, Vinita Templeton of Duncan Lewis, before he became ill, he said: \u201cAs I had served for 10 years, I expected that I would be able to remain in the UK after being discharged \u2026 I feel that the position I have had to endure since being discharged from the army is very unfair. The army let me down badly by not giving me enough notice about steps that needed to be taken in order for me and my family to remain in the UK, and also about the cost of the Home Office applications. I feel that the fees that the Home Office charge foreign national veterans for the right to remain is extremely unfair, considering the committed service we have given to this country.\u201d</p> <p>Three years ago, Home Office staff visited his wife at home while he was at work, took away her passport temporarily and told her that the family needed to make applications for leave to remain. The visit alarmed the whole family. \u201cI cannot afford the Home Office fee that needs to be paid to regularise my status in the UK \u2026 I am constantly worried and I fear that my family could face forcible removal from the UK. This would be terrible for my family, especially because my children only know life in the UK,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Templeton said the state of immigration limbo had caused ex-servicemen \u201cunimaginable suffering\u201d. When Ratucaucau became unwell, friends encouraged him to seek medical assistance, but he repeatedly refused. \u201cAll our clients are afraid that seeking medical will result in the Home Office being notified of their situation, and in being faced with medical bills that they cannot afford,\u201d Templeton said.</p> <p>They are waiting for a response from the Ministry of Defence, expected this week. In the interim, lawyers have requested that the veterans should be granted permission to work and to seek recourse to public funds, including the right to access healthcare services.</p> <p>Esita Tuimanu, the co-founder of Commonwealth Neglected Veterans, which has been supporting Ratucaucau during his hospitalisation, said: \u201cIt breaks my heart to see someone who has served for more than 10 years being treated like this. They have sacrificed so much of their life for Queen and country; they risked so much in Afghanistan and Iraq. I don\u2019t think these men and women should ever be left in this position.\u201d</p> <p>She said that medical staff had been very sympathetic but were unable to do anything about the bill. \u201cHe is really worried. He got stressed out when we discussed it on Wednesday,\u201d she said, adding that Ratucaucau would have to pay the bill somehow because unpaid NHS debts triggered an automatic refusal in any visa application.</p> <p>The Home Office stamped the passports of foreign recruits on joining the military with a note stating that they were exempt from immigration restrictions, and that they were \u201cnot subject to any condition or limitation on the period of permitted stay in the UK\u201d. The stamps were not marked with an expiry date but nevertheless became invalid on discharge; veterans say they were not informed. When they discovered, with the tightening of the Home Office\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/17/theresa-mays-hostile-environment-policy-at-heart-of-windrush-scandal\">hostile environment</a>\u201d regulations after 2012, that they were in breach of immigration rules, they struggled to resolve their difficulties, mainly because of the cost of visas.</p> <p>The armed forces employ about 4,500 Commonwealth citizens; recruitment in Commonwealth countries has recently been stepped up \u201cto build on the long-held links Britain\u2019s military has with Commonwealth countries\u201d, according to the MoD.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said it would not comment on the individual case because of ongoing legal proceedings, but added: \u201cThe service of all members of the armed forces, including Commonwealth nationals, is highly valued.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 May 2020. It was hospital staff who classified Taitusi Ratucaucau as an overseas patient, not medical staff as an earlier version stated.</p>",
  "<p>Forces allied to Libya\u2019s UN-backed prime minister, Fayez al-Sarraj, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/forces-allied-to-libyan-government-retake-key-al-watiya-airbase\">have seized a key airbase</a> from the renegade general Khalifa Haftar, dealing a huge strategic blow to the warlord\u2019s year-long campaign to capture the capital, Tripoli.</p> <p>Haftar launched a new assault to unseat the UN-recognised government in April 2019, triggering some of the most significant fighting on Libyan soil since the battle to overthrow Col Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.</p> <p>Foreign powers \u2013 notably Turkey, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Russia \u2013 are increasingly active in this new chapter of the war, leading to fears of another drawn-out proxy conflict similar to Syria.</p> <h2><strong>What are the origins of Libya\u2019s war?</strong></h2> <p>Oil-rich Libya has been in chaos since the Arab spring movement and Nato bombing campaign that toppled Gaddafi in 2011. Attempts to build a democratic state after Gaddafi fell disintegrated into a new civil war between rival governments in 2014.</p> <p>Armed groups, including extremists such as Islamic State, have proliferated and the lawless country has also become a principal transit point for people from across Africa who want to reach Europe.</p> <h2><strong>Who is currently fighting whom?</strong></h2> <p>Since 2014 the fighting has mainly been between rival centres of political power in east and west Libya: the Tripoli administration, known as the Government of National Accord (GNA), led by Sarraj, and the Tobruk administration, which decamped to the eastern city after disputed elections. The Tobruk government appointed Haftar to lead the Libyan National Army (LNA) and restore its sovereignty.</p> <p>While the GNA is officially recognised by the UN as Libya\u2019s legitimate government, it holds little power on the ground, and some distrust its Islamist politics. Haftar\u2019s supporters say he is a bulwark against extremism, while others see him as another would-be military dictator.</p> <h2><strong>What is the international community doing?</strong></h2> <p>Over the last few years foreign powers have increasingly intervened in Libya\u2019s civil war to defend their own strategic and economic interests. The GNA is backed by the UN and western countries, but its main allies are Turkey, Qatar and Italy. The LNA enjoys the support of Russia, Egypt, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and, to a lesser extent, France and Jordan.</p> <p>The foreign parties have flooded Libya with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/nov/27/libya-is-ground-zero-drones-on-frontline-in-bloody-civil-war\">weapons and drones</a>, ignoring a UN arms embargo. Russia has sent mercenaries and Sudanese men have been recruited to fight alongside the LNA; in January the Guardian reported that Turkey sent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/15/exclusive-2000-syrian-troops-deployed-to-libya-to-support-regime\">Syrian recruits</a> along with its own soldiers, to defend the Tripoli government.</p> <p>High-profile peace talks in Berlin this year did not result in any lasting truce.</p> <h2><strong>What is the humanitarian impact?</strong></h2> <p>Under Gaddafi\u2019s brutal rule, Libya had one of the highest standards of living in Africa. Now, the war economy has sent costs skyrocketing, and there are widespread problems with medicine shortages and power cuts. Civilians are in danger of getting caught in the unpredictable fighting \u2013 and kidnappings for ransom by militias are common.</p> <p>More than 200,000 people are internally displaced and 1.3 million are in need of humanitarian assistance, according to the UN. Casualty numbers are highly politicised and hard to verify, with estimates ranging from 2,500 to 25,000 during the 2011 uprising alone.</p> <p>The International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimates there are also about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/revealed-the-great-european-refugee-scandal\">636,000 migrants and refugees</a> in the country, mostly from sub-Saharan Africa. Some are held in government-run detention centres and unofficial prisons run by armed groups, where conditions are horrific: detainees report unhygienic and overcrowded conditions without adequate food and water. Human rights watchdogs also say forced labour and abuse are rife.</p> <h2><strong>What will happen next?</strong></h2> <p>The loss of al-Watiya airbase is a heavy setback for Haftar and will help Turkey expand its air operations in the conflict on behalf of the Tripoli government. The LNA\u2019s foreign backers are likely to step up their support in order to counter a string of Turkish successes since Ankara intervened in January.</p> <p>The recent escalation in fighting comes despite increased international pressure on both sides to return to negotiating a political settlement and to halt the violence over concerns about the spread of coronavirus.

The ultimate goal is to control the pandemic and resume production globally. China is one of the countries that have done well in both. How could China be passive and isolated in WHA? It is the US that should feel it failed the international community.</p> \n   <p><strong>The proposal that will eventually be adopted by the assembly will not be one that only meets US requests.

  "<p>Ike White had the kind of life that sounds too outrageous to be true. Given a life sentence for murder at the age of 19, he spent his time writing songs with his fellow prisoners and was soon discovered by Jerry Goldstein, a record producer and affiliate of Jimi Hendrix. They managed to record Ike\u2019s debut album, Changin\u2019 Times, from a mobile studio in prison in California in 1974. By 1978, Stevie Wonder had caught wind of the socially conscious, funky record and secured a new attorney for White, who petitioned for his release that year. Set free, White was poised for stardom and had just had a child with his new wife \u2013 Goldstein\u2019s secretary. Then he disappeared.</p> <p>In 2014, the story piqued the interest of Dan Vernon, the British film-maker behind The Changin\u2019 Times of Ike White, a documentary that airs this week. \u201cThe producer of my film, Vivienne Perry, first heard Changin\u2019 Times back in 2012,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt was a very obscure record that had only partially been revived as a sample on tracks by Ice Cube and Snoop Dogg, but she was fascinated by it being made in prison and started calling the people listed on the back of it. She heard all these rumours that he was dead or hiding in Hawaii [because of] tax evasion \u2013 and then one of the players, Greg Errico, said that he had changed his name to David Maestro and was now working as a lounge act in LA.\u201d</p> <p>Vernon, who had been played White\u2019s work by Perry in the back of a cab in South Africa \u201cwhile chasing down Idris Elba for a film\u201d, was blown away and decided to fly out to meet White. \u201cIke was quite surprised when he got the call from us, but he was also very welcoming \u2013 it felt like he had been waiting for someone to tell his story,\u201d he says. Vernon ended up staying at White\u2019s house for three days in 2014, hearing about his difficult upbringing and the supposedly accidental killing of a grocery store clerk during a bungled robbery that had landed him in jail. </p> <p>But there was another twist to come. Two weeks after he had returned to England with this preliminary footage, Vernon got a call from White\u2019s new wife, Lana. She told him that White was dead.</p> <p>\u201cHe was so excited about the film,\u201d Vernon says. \u201cWe found out that he had called up old friends and even Stevie Wonder to tell them about it. But he was also a guarded man and you could tell he was holding something back. It was only once I got back home that I realised he had only spoken about his time leading up to and in jail, but nothing after it.\u201d Remarkably, after only three days of knowing each other, White had entrusted Vernon with his archive, a treasure trove of photographs and tapes of his multi-instrumental noodlings that would prove to hold some of the secrets to his enigmatic past.</p> <p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t sure how we would continue on with the film, but then one day Lana called me and said she had found a tape of White getting married to someone else, despite telling her he hadn\u2019t been married before,\u201d he says. \u201cShe was obviously shocked and wanted to know more. We decided it would be the right thing to do to continue to unearth his life story, as that was one of the last things he had asked of me.\u201d</p> <p>What Lana and Vernon found was a trail of at least six different names that White had used, at least five different children he had fathered and countless wives, married either legally or otherwise. In his film, Vernon paints an evocative image of the soft-speaking White, meandering from his 2014 interviews with the man to talking-head analysis of his musical prowess, conjecture on his disappearance \u2013 perhaps owing to shady dealings with local gangsters \u2013 and then a redemptive road trip narrative. Lana meets some of his previous wives and together the women come to terms with the confusing, confused identity of the man they had loved.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never done a film before where you have the responsibility of someone\u2019s entire life in your hands,\u201d Vernon says. \u201cI think he was sick of the stigma that had followed him on the outside, the fact that people always associated him with his crime and were even asking if he should have been released at all just because of an album. So, he decided to become a chameleon, to take up new lives and families where he could to escape it all, but of course it would always catch up with him.\u201d</p> <p>Did Vernon feel deceived when he had met White? \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t feel lied to, since we ran out of time together and never captured all of his life on tape,\u201d he says. \u201cAll we could do after he died was to show him as he was: this combination of lies and truths, held together by his music, which he was always trying to better. It felt like even he might have lost sight of who he was along the way.\u201d</p> <p>Watching the film, it is certainly difficult to grasp how much of White was a master manipulator and user of women, and how much was a traumatised man attempting to escape the mistakes of his youth by any means necessary. In essence, the film plays as a parable of the difficulty of rehabilitation and biographical storytelling when your subject is so unreliable.</p> <p>Vernon believes that the film serves as a \u201cform of therapy\u201d for White\u2019s wives. There is a remarkable encounter that results in one ex providing a shamanic cleansing for Lana in the Arizona desert. \u201cThe film has given Lana a new lease of life,\u201d he says. \u201cShe wants to tell her own story now and has been writing and producing. This film is a story about the healing process and forgiveness from all the people Ike left behind.\u201d</p> <p>With Changin\u2019 Times due to be reissued, Vernon is sure that his film will raise more questions than it answers about White. \u201cThere is a lot more to mine from him,\u201d he says. \u201cVery recently, one of his friends who watched the film said to me: \u2018Why didn\u2019t you include the part of his life when he was a pornography star in Germany?\u2019 I don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s true, but this person is convinced it is, and that is just the nature of Ike\u2019s mad life. And the stories will only continue.\u201d<br><br><em>Arena: The Changin\u2019 Times of Ike White is on BBC Four </em><em>tonight </em><em>at 10pm</em></p>",

Cleaning products have been harder to get hold of, but being a smaller operation means it\u2019s easier to maintain safe distancing.<br><br>Founded in 2002, K\u00fcrten\u2019s butcher is a curious anomaly in an industry characterised by ever greater economies of scale. Around the world slaughterhouses are getting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/02/meat-plant-workers-us-coronavirus-war\">fewer and bigger</a>. \u201cWe are doing the exact opposite,\u201d K\u00fcrten reflects, a saw wedged in a swaying carcass at his side. \u201cAnd it\u2019s working really well.\u201d</p> <p>Over the course of a year he visits roughly 350 farms, usually slaughtering one to four cows, two or three pigs and as many as 38 sheep on each, and butchering them to the farmers\u2019 specifications \u2013 often, as is the case today, with their help.</p> <p>At the heart of his business lies the conviction that animals should be slaughtered on the farm. \u201cThis means they are calm,\u201d he says. \u201cThey can eat up until the last moment. Mostly they don\u2019t understand what is happening at all.\u201d</p> <p>This is why farmers such as Andrea Schmitz, who has been a client for a decade, chooses K\u00fcrten over the cheaper alternative of an industrial slaughterhouse. \u201cThe animals are born here in the barn with us and run around our fields \u2026 They aren\u2019t driving off in a truck,\u201d she says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/13/eus-live-export-trade-puts-welfare-of-millions-of-animals-at-risk-report\">EU's live export trade puts welfare of millions of animals at risk \u2013 report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Francesca Porta of the advocacy organisation Eurogroup for Animals adds: \u201cIt solves the problem of the stress of loading into a truck, the long journey to a slaughterhouse, and the unloading where the animal doesn\u2019t know where it is and then has to wait [for slaughter].\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this year the Guardian reported that as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/24/something-is-wrong-meps-say-eu-is-failing-to-regulate-live-animal-exports\">the live animal export trade</a> booms across Europe, animals are travelling ever-longer distances, while the European Commission is failing to fully implement its own transport welfare regulations. Longer journeys are linked to a trend across Europe for fewer and larger slaughterhouses, run by an increasingly small number of large commercial players.</p> <p>\u201cIn Germany we have a very strong concentration in the slaughtering industry,\u201d says Katrin Wenz, from Friends of the Earth Germany. A few smaller slaughterhouses can still be found in states such as Lower Saxony, she adds, but in places like Brandenburg companies have to transport animals over long distances. More than half the pigs in Germany, for example, are slaughtered by just <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/animals-and-animal-products/animal-products/pork_en\">three companies</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"25905d8e84f370efe544ccc7dd9f6e7fe5631365\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25905d8e84f370efe544ccc7dd9f6e7fe5631365/0_77_3000_1897/1000.jpg\" alt=\"K\u00fcrten's van with two dogs relaxing in front\" width=\"1000\" height=\"632\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Smaller slaughter companies struggle to compete against the handful of big players in Germany.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Harwart/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt became increasingly hard for smaller companies to compete,\u201d says Wenz, citing low profit margins and high EU requirements. \u201cMore and more gave up because the big industrial slaughterhouses could slaughter increasingly cheaply and efficiently.\u201d</p> <p>K\u00fcrten is not slaughtering any animals today, but when he does the farmer is usually present. His methods differ depending on the animal: a bolt gun for cattle, electric stunning for pigs and sheep. He remembers the butcher visiting his family farm when he was younger, and the village shops that slaughtered animals themselves rather than have meat delivered. Since starting his training at 16, he has witnessed the industry reconfigure: \u201cI worked [back then] in a small shop \u2013 but these aren\u2019t around any more.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is a feeling in our bones and hearts that there is something wrong with the system</p> <footer> <cite>Matthias Wolfschmidt, Foodwatch</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He believes, like many others, that the key turning point was the <a href=\"https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/meat-inspection\">EU </a><a href=\"https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/meat-inspection\"> hygiene </a><a href=\"https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/meat-inspection\"> regulations</a> that came into force in 2006. K\u00fcrten was able to find enough investment to ensure his business could comply with the new standards but many, he recalls, gave up. And while he still feels the pressure of high costs \u2013 including machinery and vets to oversee slaughter \u2013 K\u00fcrten says the business keeps growing. He\u2019s booked up months ahead.</p> <p>K\u00fcrten points to the <em>Natur Fleisch</em> (natural meat) stickers on the packages. It describes, he says, the personal relationships between the customer, farm and butcher, and that the product comes from animals \u201cthat in the summer are able to stand in the field\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAn email is sent out saying a cow has been slaughtered and five hours later everything will be sold,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd this is sent locally, among a circle of friends and acquaintances \u2013 not throughout Germany.\u201d Nothing, he\u2019s happy to say, ends up in the supermarket.</p> <p>In recent years the German slaughterhouse industry has been criticised for low pay and poor working conditions, particularly for the thousands of eastern European migrant workers it employs.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the biggest challenges for the slaughter industry today, as it will be in the next 10\u201315 years, is finding enough staff,\u201d says Thomas Bernhard, from the German Union of Food and Catering.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c71bb95fb908a356dbf494aba441f0b338bc9005\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c71bb95fb908a356dbf494aba441f0b338bc9005/0_0_2002_3000/667.jpg\" alt=\"K\u00fcrten's team butchering meat\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The meat K\u00fcrten and his team butcher is sold locally.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Harwart/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a series of interviews with German slaughterhouse workers, sociologist Marcel Sebastian at the Europa-Universit\u00e4t Flensburg, documented how they perceived the cultural shift from honest craft to source of moral stigma. \u201cThey struggled with this dramatic shift in public perception,\u201d says Sebastian.</p> <p>While many see him as a curious niche, K\u00fcrten remains optimistic.

  "<p>This was going to be the summer when, after three decades of armchair spectating, I finally got to see the Tour de France in the sinewy flesh. We had planned to catch one of the mountain stages, and not just for the pleasure of sitting on a sun-warmed rock with a cold beer watching other people work. The siren call of the Alps themselves is an even stronger draw than seeing defending champion Egan Bernal and home favourite Thibaut Pinot doing battle before my very eyes.</p> <p>It\u2019s a landscape I can\u2019t think of without a pang of longing so powerful it briefly sucks all the breath from me. Magnificent as they are draped in snow, the mountains are, for me, best in summer, when the freshness of the air hits you as you climb from the muggy valley floor, carrying with it the herbal perfume of the meadows and the gentle plink of cowbells below the looming peaks.</p> <p>Having crammed bikes into the back of the car with the dog, we were hoping to tackle the final section of stage 17, from Grenoble to the ski resort of M\u00e9ribel, once the Tour itself had moved on. Grinding up the Col de la Loze road from Courchevel, we would have passed the jump built for the 1992 Winter Olympics: still used for the World Cup every August it is, like the lifts dangling idly above the tarmac, a reminder that in a few months\u2019 time this will be a ski run again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5cedb237951ac110734ebc5682cecee708f1b438\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5cedb237951ac110734ebc5682cecee708f1b438/0_110_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The pack climbs the Galibier pass during the Tour de France.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The pack climbs the Galibier pass during the Tour de France.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christophe Ena/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The last 6km to the top are newly paved, but closed to motorised traffic, which is handy for those of us who make slow progress above 2,000 metres.

If the 2020 Tour does go ahead in August, it\u2019s safe to say I\u2019ll be cheering from home again \u2013 but this year not from the sofa but from the bony saddle of the exercise bike that now takes up half the sitting room.

  "<p>It is now certain. We will emerge from lockdown grieving for those lost and yearning for our previous lives, only to crash <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/07/snapback-uk-economy-lockdown-recession-coronavirus\">into a recession</a>. As much as we dream of visiting our favourite cafe or pub, it\u2019s not clear they will remain after the virus has run its course.</p> <p>Already reality heaves into view. The hospitality industry is being battered. <a href=\"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/05/14/your-favorite-restaurant-may-not-reopen-post-covid-opentable-study/5193994002/\">One in four</a> restaurants in the US is expected never to reopen. Amazon is finishing off the retail sector. Small businesses, cafes, online retailers and clothes designers are struggling. Loved and carefully nurtured ventures, operating on the thinnest of margins, are dying out. Every few days another one of them posts its goodbyes. We think of the world as how we left it. But that world is gone.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The working classes, the cleaners, the construction workers, have become the canaries sent back down the coal mine</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So now what? Conventional wisdom has changed almost overnight. The words \u201cthe pandemic has exposed\u201d have become a mantra, as existing fractures (apparent as they were to some of us) are revealed to all. The pandemic exposed our failing healthcare systems; the disparity between the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/06/coronavirus-crisis-nhs-not-drained-migrants-sustained-died-frontline\">perception of immigrants as a drain</a> and the reality of them as pillars of our communities; the gulf between races and classes; the incompetence of our politicians; the fatal consequences of diminishing public services.</p> <p>Even establishment bastions turned against the current political order. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7eff769a-74dd-11ea-95fe-fcd274e920ca\">The Financial Times wrote</a> that \u201cradical reforms \u2013 reversing the prevailing policy direction of the last four decades \u2013 will need to be put on the table\u201d. Emily Maitlis looked straight at the BBC Newsnight camera and <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/coronavirus-emily-maitlis-newsnight-bbc-inequality-boris-johnson-a9456696.html\">slated the inequalities</a> of the pandemic. Rightwing governments in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/10/anglo-american-coronavirus-crisis\">Britain and the US</a> scrambled to pay people to stay at home. Surely, all these things point to a revolution.</p> <p>The rupturing effects of the lockdown appear to be laying the foundations for our new world. \u201cNature is healing\u201d is now a meme. The air is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/30/clean-air-in-europe-during-lockdown-leads-to-11000-fewer-deaths\">cleaning itself</a>. As we clap each Thursday, the old hierarchies that defined \u201cskilled\u201d and \u201cunskilled\u201d seem to be dissolving. Some hold out for further changes, anticipating the introduction of low-carbon jobs to replace those lost, or a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/03/universal-basic-income-coronavirus-shocks\">universal basic income</a>, or rethinking the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/15/humans-resources-coronavirus-democratise-work-health-lives-market\">value of labour</a> altogether.</p> <p>But observation alone does not bring about transformation. There is a naivety in the hope that once ideas are discussed and made popular, they will permeate policymaking and bring about change. History shows us that, during a period of economic upheaval, this is unlikely. The 2008 financial crisis is the clearest cautionary tale.</p> <p>In reality, the first thing that happens in a recession tends not to be radical reengineering of the economy. The first impulse is to make a quick calculation: who should be saved and who is dispensable. In the US after the 2008 crash, the banks were recapitalised and the economy stabilised, and <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/5-groups-still-recovering-from-the-financial-crisis/\">10 million Americans</a> lost their homes. The only factor that mattered was how many people could be lost without disrupting the economy for everyone else.</p> <p>That question is already being asked with regard to the current lockdown. How many deaths can we afford before the economy suffers? Who are we happy to sacrifice, so that the rest of us can thrive? In the UK, the answer to that second question has been those already disproportionately affected by the pandemic. The working classes, the cleaners, the construction workers \u2013 the manual levers of the economy \u2013 have become the canaries, sent back down the coal mine to test the first stage of lockdown easing. If infections surge, it will hit them first.</p> <p>If the loss of life is at a level deemed acceptable by big business and government, the focus will shift to moving on while minimising the need for change. The old order \u2013 that some are already writing eulogies for \u2013 will surge back rather than retreating. We will be told that deep-rooted reform is not necessary because this is an unprecedented crisis, an unforeseen event, a once-in-a-lifetime shock. Any failings are merely opportunities to learn lessons, as the prime minister\u2019s deputy, Dominic Raab, is fond of saying: lessons about how to respond to an exact similar threat rather than reflect on the reason it was allowed to take hold in the first place.</p> <p>The language of a resilient infrastructure doing its best is deliberate \u2013 useful in creating the impression that once the pandemic passes, so does the problem. Failures in the care sector are \u201cchallenges\u201d; the NHS, rather than being underfunded and weakened, has been a success because it has not been overwhelmed, ignoring the infected patients who were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/29/care-homes-refusing-to-take-in-patients-discharged-nhs-hospitals-coronavirus-risk\">shipped out from hospitals</a> to care homes to spread the deadly virus to the most frail.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/17/show-care-lockdown-clap-transgressors-rontline-workers-pandemic\">We're all keen to show we care, but we've shaped a society that doesn\u2019t care at all | Sam Byers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fuelled by dissembling and denial, the country lurches forward with a broken economy, a depleted public sector, an underpaid and underprotected class of workers, and a vilified migrant population.</p> <p>In the final stages, policies to help the vulnerable launched at the start of the pandemic will be quietly jettisoned.

The homeless returning to the streets will be joined by others sent there by the economic downturn.

  "<p>The Rev Jesse Jackson was born in the racially segregated south when Franklin Roosevelt occupied the White House and war raged in Europe. He was an eyewitness to the assassination of Martin Luther King, campaigned against the Vietnam war and twice ran for US president.</p> <p>But, now an elder statesman of 78, he has never seen anything like the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected more than 1 million Americans and killed more in April alone than died in Vietnam over 15 years. The world\u2019s most powerful and wealthy country also bears by far its biggest death toll: almost 90,000. It is enough to shake faith in American exceptionalism.</p> <p>\u201cOur military cannot defeat this germ,\u201d Jackson says by phone from Chicago, one of the hardest-hit cities. \u201cHaving the biggest banks, having the biggest military has no meaning in this kind of germ warfare. The frontline is not soldiers; the frontline is doctors and nurses. The planes are grounded, the bombs are irrelevant. It turns out that pride precedes a fall. Sometimes people have to learn that we don\u2019t control everything.\u201d</p> <p>Despite lockdown and Parkinson\u2019s disease, Jackson is still working with gusto at the Rainbow Push Coalition, a progressive organisation he founded in 1996. It has convened thousands of black doctors and lawyers and released a manifesto suggesting that high-risk groups, including African Americans, be prioritised for coronavirus testing.</p> <p>Jackson has twice written to Donald Trump urging testing for the 2.2 million people currently in prison. At a time when most Americans are looking inward, he has also called for massive intervention in Africa, a particularly vulnerable continent that is close to his heart.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"55dddb9dfcb17798d138912412644c022255a838\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55dddb9dfcb17798d138912412644c022255a838/25_33_1319_1965/671.jpg\" alt=\"Jesse Jackson in 1988 in the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination.\" width=\"671\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jesse Jackson in 1988 in the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cynthia Johnson/The LIFE Images Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re working virtually, making conference calls, using this time to organise people,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked to about 2,000 ministers around the nation over the past 10 days, trying to convince their congregations to honour the protocols and stay in the house.\u201d</p> <p>For a brief while it became voguish to indulge a comforting myth that the coronavirus was the great equaliser, touching the bus driver and Prince of Wales alike. But while infections do not discriminate, humans do. Despite making up only 13% of the US population, African Americans represent 30% of the deaths from the coronavirus.</p> <p>A Senate Democratic Policy and Communications Committee <a href=\"https://www.democrats.senate.gov/dpcc/press-reports/dpcc-report-racial-disparities-on-full-displaycovid-19-is-disproportionately-affecting-communities-of-color\">report </a><a href=\"https://www.democrats.senate.gov/dpcc/press-reports/dpcc-report-racial-disparities-on-full-displaycovid-19-is-disproportionately-affecting-communities-of-color\">last month concluded</a> that people of colour have less access to quality healthcare, are more likely to have a pre-existing health condition and suffer greater exposure to air pollution that puts them at higher risk of asthma. They also make up a disproportionate share of frontline workers, are less likely to be able to work from home and more likely to rely on public transport, and are hit hardest by poverty as layoffs continue to rise.</p> <p>\u201cWe know that people should honour the [social distancing] protocols, but some find it more difficult because of congested conditions or their transportation,\u201d says Jackson. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/los-angeles-coronavirus-inequality-undocumented-healthcare\">A lot are untested and uninsured</a>. If you\u2019re uninsured, you can go to the hospitals only to be told you can\u2019t get service, so you end up resorting to your own home remedies, or you end up in the hospital too late.</p> <p>\u201cThat points to disparity in income and education and healthcare. It shows the black condition in America. The legacy of slavery and Jim Crow is very clear.\u201d</p> <p>Like Trump\u2019s regressive presidency, the virus is a shock to the system that forces a confrontation with class, race and structural inequality. What had been ambient noise for the privileged is suddenly vividly clear and difficult to ignore.</p> <p>\u201cAfter 400 years of slavery, segregation and discrimination, why would anybody be shocked that African Americans are dying disproportionately from the coronavirus?\u201d Jackson <a href=\"https://chicagocrusader.com/why-are-african-americans-dying-disproportionately-to-the-coronavirus/\">asked in a statement published on 7 April</a>, arguing that all past US presidents have failed to \u201cend the virus of white superiority and fix the multifaceted issues confronting African Americans\u201d.</p> <p>He adds, by phone: \u201cAmerica has decided the place of blacks in this society, which is beneath that of European immigrants. People say America is 244 years old, but Africans have been here 157 years before the constitution. We shouldn\u2019t say America was founded in 1776 \u2013 it started with slavery in 1619; so we\u2019re still invisible to that extent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7948d55f3e787ee8e1543c3436b1e631cd0c5d13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7948d55f3e787ee8e1543c3436b1e631cd0c5d13/0_0_3435_2305/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jackson at the 1972 Democratic convention in Miami, which nominated George McGovern.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"671\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jackson at the 1972 Democratic convention in Miami, which nominated George McGovern.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wally McNamee/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe still make less, live under stresses and don\u2019t live as long. We\u2019re still looked upon as the other based upon skin colour, as some kind of irreparable sin in the society. People try to adjust to it but, when a pandemic sets in, the data comes out.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re about 60% of prisoners in this country. People are sick behind those walls. You can have 200 inmates sick with Covid-19 and the workers go home and they spread it. So the prisons become the epicentre of the untreated and untested and undetected.\u201d</p> <p>Itching to revive their economies, several southern states led by mostly white male governors are already reopening bowling alleys, cinemas, hairdressers, restaurants and other outlets against federal guidelines. A <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/gdpr-consent/?next_url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.washingtonpost.com%2fpolitics%2f2020%2f04%2f28%2fblack-activists-officials-see-major-threat-souths-plans-reopen%2f\">group of activists</a>, mostly black women, warned in a petition that reopening now \u201cis irresponsible and a death sentence for many of us\u201d.</p> <p>White privilege will offer no immunity in an interconnected society, says Jackson. \u201cIf blacks are the drivers and unprotected, the driven are hurt. If the cooks and waiters are unprotected, those they cook for are all unprotected. So we\u2019re more integrated than we realise on a daily basis.</p> <p>\u201cSo we really must have healthcare for all as one of the by-products of this pandemic. Anybody who\u2019s left out is a threat to those who are left in. When people as affluent as Prince Charles and Boris Johnson and athletes are affected, it means that the gated community did not protect you from the pandemic. If the poor are not protected, the rich are in jeopardy, because you cannot separate by community the poor from the rich, the white from the black.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e0dbd14c23583b71911f99a88a27e694605d5ec8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0dbd14c23583b71911f99a88a27e694605d5ec8/608_479_2392_1668/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Martin Luther King in 1968 a day before King\u2019s assassination at the same spot.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"697\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Martin Luther King in 1968 a day before King\u2019s assassination at the same spot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Kelly/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Roosevelt was tested by the Great Depression and second world war and rose to the challenge.

The infrastructure that [George W] Bush and Barack had put together on pandemics was ignored. He dismantled the infrastructure and did not pay adequate attention to the threat.</p> <p>\u201cAs the threat changed, we didn\u2019t have ventilators and respirators. All our preparation was for a financial fight or a military fight. He should have declared a national testing mechanism. There should have been a national lockdown to break the back of it. The attention should have been early; it was not.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has sought absolution at press briefings that sometimes run for more than two hours with a mix of self-congratulation, bloated exaggerations, broadsides at reporters and bad science. He recently ad libbed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/25/donald-trump-coronavirus-disinfectant-sarcastic-tipping-point\">jaw-dropping proposal to study the merits of injecting disinfectant into coronavirus patients</a>. It has left his opponent in November\u2019s election, the former vice president Joe Biden, struggling to get a share of the limelight.</p> <p>\u201cTrump is using the daily press briefing as a platform to promote his politics while Biden is facing lockdown in his basement.

Biden\u2019s campaign fell apart after he quoted without attribution the then British Labour leader, Neil Kinnock, and was accused of plagiarism. Jackson, bidding to become the US\u2019s first black president, gathered 7m votes and finished first or second in 46 out of 54 primary contests. But he lost the nomination to Michael Dukakis, who went down to George HW Bush.</p> <p>Does it hurt that he will never be president? \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t,\u201d he says firmly, \u201cbecause I was a trailblazer, I was a pathfinder. I had to deal with doubt and cynicism and fears about a black person running. There were black scholars writing papers about why I was wasting my time. Even blacks said a black couldn\u2019t win.\u201d</p> <p>Some of his foreign policy positions at the time, he points out, became widely adopted: a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians, the release of Nelson Mandela from prison in South Africa (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/08/thatcher-advisers-suspicious-jesse-jackson-visit\">he met Margaret Thatcher to plead for Britain</a> to drop its support for the apartheid regime). In 2000 he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the US\u2019s highest civilian honour.</p> <p>When Obama won in 2008, he praised Jackson for making his run possible. As Obama delivered his election night victory speech at Grant Park in Chicago before a crowd of 240,000, Jackson\u2019s tear-stained face was among the most indelible images. \u201cIt was a big moment in history,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI cried because I thought about those who made it possible who were not there \u2026 People who paid a real price: Ralph Abernathy, Dr King, Medgar Evers, Fannie Lou Hamer, those who fought like hell [at the Democratic national convention] in Atlantic City in 64, those in the movement in the south.\u201d </p> <p>Some felt that Obama should have pushed faster and further on racial justice in his two terms. But Jackson ranks him among the US\u2019s top presidents. \u201cFirst, given America\u2019s history in terms of race, he inspired indescribable pride. No 2, his family and their decency and dignity were a big deal.\u201d</p> <p>He points to the Paris climate accords, Iran nuclear deal, rapprochement with Cuba and rescue of the economy as signal achievements. \u201cHe stabilised the ship when the ship was sinking and got it back above the water. And no scandal. Trump creates a desire for Barack all over again. When he travelled around the world, he was the best face America\u2019s ever had.\u201d</p> <p>In March, Jackson endorsed Bernie Sanders, returning a compliment from 1988 when Sanders backed his campaign. \u201cHis ideas made the most sense to me,\u201d he explains. But after a promising start Sanders fell away, partly because of his failure to connect with older African American voters, where Biden dominated.</p> <p>\u201cHis campaign was [about] class without appreciating the caste dimension of poverty,\u201d Jackson explains by way of post-mortem. \u201cThere are 55 black members of Congress and he didn\u2019t have one. Maybe one or two black mayors, but he didn\u2019t cultivate an African American constituency.\u201d</p> <p>Biden, meanwhile, benefited from his \u201ckinship\u201d with Obama as well as Trump\u2019s repeated attacks that kept his profile up and his name on the front pages. \u201cThe opposition had no infrastructure for the black vote. In many ways, he inherited votes he didn\u2019t campaign for.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1c0ab365ca2b0e711ca6df5ee832b9671430bc7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1c0ab365ca2b0e711ca6df5ee832b9671430bc7/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Bernie Sanders in March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Bernie Sanders in March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Olson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In recent weeks, Biden has been endorsed by Sanders, Obama, Hillary Clinton, House speaker Nancy Pelosi and the civil rights hero John Lewis in a show of party unity. Will Jackson support him enthusiastically? \u201cYeah, as an alternative to the present administration, but we\u2019ve not had a meeting with the black constituency on what our demands are.\u201d</p> <p>The ground is shifting under Trump and Biden\u2019s feet. Sanders argues that the pandemic, which has put more than 30 million Americans out of work, shows the failure of the US healthcare system. As an opportunity to reimagine the social contract, the present moment is being compared with Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal or the post second-world-war consensus in Britain.</p> <p>\u201cBiden won the delegates but Sanders won the issues,\u201d Jackson reflects. \u201cSanders\u2019 agenda will dominate the [Democratic national] convention. One of the by-products of this pandemic is going to be the need for healthcare for all. We can\u2019t afford not to have healthcare for all because if you see the gap between the 1% and 99%, the 1% can\u2019t hide from who it is that\u2019s caring for the masses. The real soldiers are not the investment bankers. It\u2019s the doctors and nurses. There is a new appreciation of the common people, doctors and janitors and truck drivers, what they call essential workers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn many ways,\u201d he says, \u201cas African Americans, we\u2019re at the the bottom of the foundation. The foundation is where it starts from. So when the foundation\u2019s in trouble, the whole building\u2019s in trouble.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2><strong>Global infections pass 4.7 million</strong></h2> <p>There are 4,716,513 confirmed cases of coronavirus worldwide. At least 315,187<strong> </strong>people have died over the course of the pandemic The number of deaths in the US is approaching 90,000, with 89,562 confirmed fatalities and 1,486,757 infections, according to the Johns Hopkins university tracker.</p> <h2><strong>US Federal Reserve Chair says unemployment could reach 25%</strong></h2> <p>US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Sunday that US unemployment could peak at 25%, but expressed optimism Sunday that the economy could begin to recover from a devastating recession in the second half of the year, assuming the coronavirus doesn\u2019t erupt in a second wave.</p> <h2><strong>Japan\u2019s </strong><strong>falls into recession </strong></h2> <p>Japan dived into its first recession since 2015, according to official data Monday, with the world\u2019s third-largest economy contracting by 0.9% in the first quarter as it wrestled with the fallout from the coronavirus. The cabinet office reported a drop of 3.4% annual pace in seasonally adjusted real gross domestic product, or GDP, the total value of a nation\u2019s goods and services, for the January-March period, compared to the previous quarter.</p> <h2><strong>South Africa reports highest daily increase in cases</strong></h2> <p>South Africa on Sunday reported 1,160 new coronavirus infections, the highest daily number since the first case was recorded in March \u201cAs of today, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in South Africa is 15,515, with 1,160 new cases identified in the last 24 hour cycle of testing,\u201d the health ministry said in a statement. The Western Cape province, popular with tourists, accounted for nearly 60% of the national numbers.</p> <h2><strong>S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil mayor says hospitals \u2018near collapse\u2019</strong></h2> <p>In Brazil, the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-52701524\">BBC</a> has reported that the mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo, the country\u2019s largest city, has warned that hospitals have reached 90% capacity and are \u201cnear collapse\u201d; they could run out of space in just two weeks\u2019 time, he said. Brazil has the fourth-highest number of infections worldwide, with 241,080, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. It has recorded 16,118 deaths. Meanwhile, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro greeted hundreds of supporters and joined some in a series of push-ups who gathered before the presidential offices Sunday.</p> <h2><strong>Death tolls fall in UK, Spain and Italy</strong></h2> <p>In a possible glimmer of hope, Sunday saw lower death tolls reported in the UK, Spain and Italy. The UK\u2019s daily coronavirus death toll was the lowest since lockdown began, with 170 deaths recorded. However, the Sunday and Monday figures tend to be lower than other days because of weekend testing rates. Meanwhile Spain<strong> </strong> recorded its lowest single-day death toll in two months. Italy on Sunday recorded its lowest daily toll, 145, since lockdown was declared. There were 153 deaths registered during the previous 24 hour period.</p> <h2><strong>Move Rohingya on Bangladesh island to refugee camps, says UN chief</strong></h2> <p>Hundreds of Rohingya rescued by Bangladesh and sent to a flood-prone island after being stranded at sea for weeks should be moved to existing refugee camps, the UN secretary general has said. The appeal by Antonio Guterres to Bangladesh\u2019s foreign minister in a letter obtained Sunday by AFP comes as concern grows over a coronavirus outbreak in the sprawling camps near the border with Myanmar. A fourth virus case has been detected in the crowded camps, officials said Sunday.</p> <h2><strong>WHO committee to discuss Taiwan exclusion</strong></h2> <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) is to raise the question of Taiwan\u2019s participation as an observer at the World Health Assembly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/world-health-assembly-what-is-it-and-what-is-the-coronavirus-inquiry-china-taiwan-origins\">which opens virtually on Monday</a>, before one of its committees. Diplomatic allies of Taiwan, including Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Paraguay, have formally requested to invite Taiwan to the meeting as an observer. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has also said publicly he wants Taiwan in the room.</p> <h2><strong>India extends lockdown by another two weeks</strong></h2> <p>India has extended its lockdown to 31 May, but with some easing of restrictions. States are being given greater power to reopen markets and standalone stores, bus and other public transport travel being allowed between and within states. However, shopping malls, air travel, cinemas, schools and places of worship will remain closed. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/17/coronavirus-live-news-barack-obama-attacks-trump-virus-response?page=with:block-5ec146888f0886ce4f5d52ff#block-5ec146888f0886ce4f5d52ff\">Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai and other key regions</a> are still fighting to control the rising curve of coronavirus infections.

The government has also advised people over 65, those with co-morbidities, pregnant women, and children below the age of 10, should stay at home.</p> <p>States will have the power to determine red, orange and green zones, as well as so-called containment zones, where large outbreaks or clusters happen, and different rules will apply in each zone. The country has been under lockdown since 25 March.</p> <p>In <strong>Italy</strong>, St Peter\u2019s Basilica will open for the first time on Monday since the lockdown began. Public masses will resume, and restaurants, bars, cafes, shops and hairdressers, among other businesses, are all expected to reopen.</p> <p>The Pope will celebrate a private mass on Monday, broadcast by video, but the Duomo in Milan will conduct a general mass at 10.30am local time. The cathedral said it had introduced gadgets worn around the neck that beep softly, flash and vibrate if visitors approach too closely to one another.</p> <p>Elsewhere in Europe, death tolls dropped in the <strong>UK </strong>and<strong> Spain,</strong> offering a glimmer of hope. Britain recorded 170 deaths, and Spain reported 87. Italy also recorded its lowest daily toll since the lockdown began \u2013 145.</p> <p><strong>South Africa</strong> has reported 1,160 new coronavirus infections, the highest daily number since the first case was recorded in March.</p> <p>\u201cAs of today, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in South Africa is 15,515, with 1,160 new cases identified in the last 24 hour cycle of testing,\u201d a statement from the health ministry said.</p> <p>The Western Cape province, popular with tourists, accounted for nearly 60% of the 15,515 infections nationally. There have been 264 deaths.</p> <p>The country has been under a lockdown since 27 March, including strict confinement rules and a ban on sales of cigarettes and alcohol.</p> <p>In other coronavirus developments:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Global infections </strong>stood at 4,713,620, with 315,185 deaths recorded.
