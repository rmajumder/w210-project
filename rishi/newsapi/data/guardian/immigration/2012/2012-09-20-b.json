  "<p>New Mexico governor Susana Martinez has asked her administration to remove a reference to \"forcible rape\" from a new state policy, after its use was criticised by women's groups.</p> <p>The outdated and inaccurate language, which effectively narrows the definition of rape, became the subject of heated debate in August after Republican Missouri senate nominee Todd Akin used the term \"legitimate rape\" in describing his anti-abortion views.<br><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/19/new-mexico-forcible-rape-child-care-policy_n_1898617.html?utm_hp_ref=politics\"><br>The Huffington Post reported on Wednesday</a> that the term appeared in the New Mexico's proposed changes to its official applications to childcare assistance. The state's children, youth and families department was proposing changes to its means-testing policy for childcare assistance that would exempt only victims of \"forcible rape\" and incest from having to file child support claims against the father.</p> <p>Women's and family groups reacted angrily, saying that using such language made a distinction between \"forcible\" and other rapes, even though all rapes involve force. It would also, critics said, push victims of rapes not considered \"forcible\" \u2013 such as statutory rape of a minor \u2013 to contact their rapists to pursue them for child support before being eligible for childcare assistance.</p> <p>No-one at the state's CYFD was available for comment.</p> <p>Enrique Knell, a spokesperson for the CYFD, told the Huffington Post that Martinez, a Republican, asked the department to remove the word \"forcible\" from the language on Wednesday night.</p> <p>\"It's redundant, unnecessary, and she [Martinez] doesn't support its usage,\" Knell said.</p> <p>He said the CYFD had used such language because the FBI still uses the definition, as do some federal regulations relating to paternity disputes.</p> <p>Martinez, a former district attorney, <a href=\"http://www.rhrealitycheck.org/article/2012/09/19/new-mexico-governor-susan-martinez-seeks-proof-forcible-rape-in-applications-chil\">also used the words \"forcible rape\" in a proclamation about New Mexico's Sexual awareness month in April</a>.</p> <p>Carol Tracy, the executive director of Woman's Law Project, which has long campaigned for the definition of \"forcible rape\" to be changed, welcomed Martinez's removal of the term.</p> <p>She said: \"It is a good move, a progressive move. Because rape is force enough.\"</p> <p>The definition of rape used by the FBI in its Uniform Crime Report was revised from \"forcible rape\" to rape in January this year. Rape is now defined federally as: \"The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.\"</p> <p>However, states vary in their definition of rape.</p> <p>Attorney general Eric Holder, announcing the changes earlier this year, said: \"The longstanding, narrow definition of forcible rape, first established in 1927, is 'the carnal knowledge of a female, forcibly and against her will.' It thus included only forcible male penile penetration of a female vagina and excluded oral and anal penetration; rape of males; penetration of the vagina and anus with an object or body part other than the penis; rape of females by females; and non-forcible rape.\"</p> <p>\u2022 We originally referred to Susana Martinez as a former attorney general. We should have said district attorney. This has now been changed.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama has described lack of immigration reform as the biggest failure of his presidency, but blamed his inability to legalise millions of undocumented immigrants on what he implicitly admitted was another failure \u2013 the collapse of his attempts at compromise and consensus with Congress and the realisation that he \"cannot change Washington from the inside\".</p> <p>Obama was repeatedly pressed on immigration by a mostly Latino audience in an interview on the Spanish-language Univision TV station in Miami. He was forced to defend his record on deportations of illegal immigrants and to deny that his order in July allowing about 1.7 million young undocumented migrants to obtain work permits was an election ploy.</p> <p>Obama was also accused of breaking a promise, made during the 2008 presidential election campaign, to permit a path to citizenship or residency for many undocumented immigrants during his first year in office.</p> <p>Asked later in the interview what the greatest failure of his presidency has been, Obama returned to the topic.</p> <p>\"My biggest failure so far is [that] we haven't gotten comprehensive immigration reform done,\" the president said. \"But it's not for lack of trying or desire \u2013 and I'm confident that we're going to accomplish that.\"</p> <p>Obama denied he had broken his promise and went on to blame his inability \"to change the tone in Washington\" for the lack of an immigration reform law. He said that as soon as he came to power, Republicans conspired to block him.</p> <p>Obama said he could not find a single Republican to work with him on immigration legislation. He said he had been \"naive\".</p> <p>\"The most important lesson I've learned is that you can't change Washington from the inside; you can only change it from the outside. That's how I got elected and that's how the big accomplishments like healthcare got done, was because we mobilised the American people to speak out,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Something I'd really like to concentrate on in my second term is being in a much more constant conversation with the American people so that they can put pressure on Congress to help move some of these issues forward.\"</p> <p>Opinion polls show Latino voters to be twice as likely to vote for Obama as Romney, but many votes are up for grabs in some battleground states such as Florida.</p> <p>The Republicans, keen to go on the offensive after a torrid two weeks, immediately pounced on the remarks, with Mitt Romney repeatedly mentioning them during a speech in Sarasota. Claiming that the president had broken a promise made in 2008, Romney said: \"His slogan was: 'Yes we can'. Now it's: 'No I can't'.\"</p> <p>On Twitter, Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, wrote: \"Between no immigration reform and can't change DC from the inside, seems like Obama just admitted his 08 campaign was garbage.\"</p> <p>The Univision audience questioned Obama on issues that rarely get much of an airing in the US English-language media, such as combating Mexico's drug cartels.</p> <p>But the primary focus was on immigration, a source of considerable concern in Hispanic communities where families often have relatives or friends who are in the US illegally.</p> <p>Obama was pressed on why there has been a rise in deportations of illegal immigrants under his presidency. He said that it was in part because Congress put more money into enforcing border controls. Nonetheless, he said the target of deportation is not \"hard-working families\" and those with long ties to the US.</p> <p>\"More than half of our enforcement now is directed at people with criminal records. Of the remaining half, about two-thirds are people who are typically apprehended close to the border. So these are not people who have long standing roots,\" he said.</p> <p>But he added: \"We still ultimately have to change the laws.\"</p> <p>Although Obama faced strong scepticism at times, he appeared to emerge in better shape than his Republican rival, after Romney a similar appearance on Wednesday on Univision, a principal source of news for a large number of Latino voters.</p> <p>Romney was accused of evading questions about whether he would deport undocumented aliens, including the young people Obama ordered should be permitted to stay. Eventually an exasperated Romney said: \"We're not going to round up 12 million people, that includes kids and parents, and have them all deported.\"</p> <p>Romney said that as president he would find a \"permanent solution\" to an immigration system that has \"been broken for years\". This included temporary work permits and permanent residency cards to people with advanced qualifications. </p> <p>But he repeatedly refused to say whether he would overturn Obama's order permitting young illegal immigrants without a criminal record to remain in the US and obtain a work permit.</p> <p>\"These kids deserve something better than temporary \u2013 they deserve a permanent position,\" Romney said without offering a specific alternative.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Romney said he favoured policies to promote \"self-deportation\" of illegal immigrants, but he downplayed that on Wednesday.</p> <p>Rommey's attempt to woo Hispanic voters was further damaged on Thursday with the emergence of a clip from a video of a Romney fundraiser in which he said that illegal immigrants generally \"have no skill or experience\".</p> <p>\"Gosh, I'd love to bring in more legal immigrants that have skill and knowledge. I'd like to staple a green card to every PhD in the world and say, 'Come to America, we want you here.' Instead, we make it hard for people who get educated here or elsewhere to make this their home,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Unless, of course, you have no skill or experience, in which case you're welcome to cross the border and stay here for the rest of your life. It's very strange.\"</p> <p>Obama took the opportunity to take a jab at Romney over other parts of the fundraiser video which has been leaked in recent days - particularly Romney's assertion that the half of American voters who support Obama pay no income tax, rely on the government for handouts and think of themselves as victims.</p> <p>Obama said Romney is out of touch.</p> <p>\"When you express an attitude that half the country considers itself victims, that somehow they want to be dependent on government, my thinking is maybe you haven't gotten around a lot,'\" he said.</p>",

  "<p>Next Wednesday, four women and 15 men on the Crown Nominations Commission will gather for two days of prayer and horsetrading to replace Rowan Williams as archbishop of Canterbury. We know who they are, and when they will meet \u2013 but not where, so they can't be doorstepped.</p> <p>Only three members of the commission, chaired by the former Conservative arts minister Lord Luce, are bishops. One of the women and two of the men have no vote, but are there to advise. Five, including one of the women, are priests. The rest are lay people. Almost all the parties of the church are represented and there is even Dr Barry Morgan, a Welshman, to represent the rest of the world for the first time in this process. They will pick two names to present to the prime minister, who is bound to choose the first, unless he proves unable to take the job.</p> <p>The man they choose will have at least five jobs at once in his new post, and very little power in any of them. He is a bishop in Kent. He sits in the House of Lords. He chairs meetings of the bishops of all England. In some very nebulous sense he is also the leader of the Anglican communion, a worldwide body with no agreed doctrine and no discipline, which has rejected all attempts to supply it with either. If the Queen dies, he will crown her successor. When the nation requires religious pageantry, he must supply it and star in it.</p> <p>\"The next man has got to be able to hold together the Anglican communion, and to stare down the loony left and the loony right on sexual questions,\" says Stephen Kuhrt, a south London vicar who represents centrist evangelical opinion. \"There are those who want a split as soon as possible, but the vast majority of Anglicans want a working compromise on sexuality. We need someone who can communicate a bit more on a popular level than Rowan, and is a bit tougher.\"</p> <p>This time last year the two main candidates were John Sentamu, the archbishop of York, and Richard Chartres, the bishop of London. Neither filled the church with much enthusiasm. Sentamu wanted the job too obviously. Chartres has refused to ordain women. Both men are in their 60s, and Sentamu is not in perfect health. This matters because if one of the jobs of the archbishop is to run the Anglican communion \u2013 well, to head it, since it is not a body coherent enough to run \u2013 he must be in shape for the next Lambeth Conference in 2018, when most of the Anglican bishops of the world will come together.</p> <p>During the Occupy crisis last year, Charters originally wanted the protestors cleared away, but after Giles Fraser resigned the bishop reversed position with blinding speed and conviction. Chartres is hugely experienced, having served as Robert Runcie's chaplain, and he can point to the fact that church attendance in his diocese has grown over the last decade.</p> <p>Sentamu's qualifications are drive, intelligence and a gift for theatre. As a black African former asylum seeker he is able to praise British patriotism extravagantly. He seems at home as a columnist for the Sun on Sunday, where he writes things such as: \"We shouldn't be shy about saying how great our country is.\" He inspires devotion in his staff but two people separately said to me he will never get the job because he sat on the appointments committee for five years, and some of his former colleagues there are determined that he should not. He has drifted out in the betting.</p> <p>\"John Sentamu is a great public face for Christianity in this country, but not a great manager of people,\" says Kuhrt. \"Of course, in this job you do have to challenge the Captain Mainwarings if you want anything to happen.\"</p> <p>Beyond them, candidates are less obvious. Among the younger bishops the bookies early anointed Christopher Cocksworth, bishop of Coventry, as favourite. He is an evangelical, ran a theological college, and he hasn't offended any powerful lobbies. But reports from his diocese suggest that he hasn't offended anyone only because he can't take decisions. Sentiment has quietly but decisively swung away from him.</p> <p>James Jones, the bishop of Liverpool, who has just chaired the Hillsborough inquiry, is another possible caretaker choice. Although he has a firm evangelical background, he is sympathetic to gay clergy and an enthusiastic green. He had heart surgery last year, and though a fluent speaker, he lacks the star quality possessed in their different ways by both Sentamu and Chartres.</p> <p>Graham James, the bishop of Norwich, is favourite everywhere of the steady-as-she-goes party. He is widely experienced \u2013 he worked in Lambeth Palace under the previous archbishop, Lord Carey \u2013 and widely trusted, as well as scholarly. But critics say he has the charisma of a tea cosy and exemplifies the benevolent but out-of-touch quality of a church cut off from the mainstream of English life.</p> <p>Outsiders include Nick Baines, the newly appointed bishop of Bradford. He is active on Twitter, where journalists notice him, and he is both interested in the media and largely unafraid of it. He is an evangelical, which ticks one important box, but youth (he's 51) and inexperience should tell against him.</p> <p>Another possible is John Inge, bishop of Worcester, a former public schoolmaster favoured by some centrist evangelicals. He is the author of an unlikely work of theology, Living Love, which takes as its starting point the detective novels of Alexander McCall Smith.</p> <p>Liberals make wistful noises about Stephen Cottrell, the bishop of Chelmsford. He was the man with briefly the worst job in the church \u2013 brought in as the unimpeachably heterosexual bishop of Reading after Williams lost his nerve in the face of a concerted and international evangelical campaign and forced his old friend Jeffrey John, a celibate gay man, to withdraw from the post. That was in many ways the defining catastrophe of Williams's term in office, and his surrender ensured that bitter infighting over gay clergy would continue for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>\"Stephen Cottrell has got nous, native wit, and common sense. It is an impossible job, but we are ready for someone to say, when a crisis comes along, like the banking crisis, 'Look, this is bad' and to do so in a joined up, cogent, and clear way,\" says Rachel Boulding, deputy editor of the Church Times.</p> <p>But Cottrell also has limited experience and is too friendly to gay clergy and gay rights to be acceptable to most evangelical opinion.</p> <p>This leaves the dark horse, whom no one was discussing a year ago, yet now seems to lead the field: Justin Welby, the bishop of Durham. The reason why Welby was never discussed earlier is also the big strike against him. He wasn't even a bishop this time last year, but dean of Liverpool. He was only consecrated as bishop in the new year. This also means that he has made no enemies yet.</p> <p>Welby is an evangelical; he's also an old Etonian. But people who might be repelled by either or both of these traits tend not to be in practice. He charmed Giles Fraser, for example. He is thoughtful about the Church of England's problems. If these were primarily financial, he would be the outstanding candidate. Not only did he have a successful career as an oil trader before seeking ordination, he turned around the finances of Liverpool Cathedral when he ran it.</p> <p>None of the candidates will bring comfort to a Tory government. The most establishment candidates are Chartres and Welby. But Chartres is a Prince Charles-type Tory who wants less capitalism and more hierarchy. Welby has been an informed critic of the banks. Sentamu was stopped and searched eight times by the Metropolitan police while he was bishop of Stepney, and served on the Macpherson committee that accused the force of institutionalised racism.</p> <p>Whoever he is, the next archbishop will face other large problems, even though the issue of female bishops will probably not be among them. It looks as if a form of words has been agreed which both supporters and opponents can accept, so that the first will be consecrated next year.</p> <p>The struggle over gay clergy will continue for the foreseeable future. Opinion within congregations is slowly shifting as it has shifted in the outside world. But the long stalemate, punctuated by vicious little skirmishes, can only be expected to continue.</p> <p>There is the slow international fissioning of the Anglican communion, where conservative Africans and Asians have been trying for years to throw out the more liberal churches of North America, with the Church of England caught uneasily between factions. It's difficult to see any compromise there except the peace of exhaustion.</p> <p>With all these difficulties at home and abroad it's lucky that the Crown Nominations Commission believe in prayer, since prayer will work at least as well as horsetrading when it meets next week to choose its victim.</p>",
  "<p>Latinos living without immigration papers in Arizona have begun bombarbing helplines and lawyers' offices with anxious requests about how to provide for their children should they be arrested under a controversial new police power that came into effect this week.</p> <p><a href=\"http://respect-respeto.org/\">A phone line</a> hosted by the Arizona branch of the <a href=\"http://acluaz.org\">American Civil Liberties Union</a> has received almost 4,000 calls in just two days, many from anxious parents who fear that their children could be left abandoned should they be picked up under the so-called 'show-me-your-papers' provision. Hundreds have been asking for help setting up a \"power of attorney\", which gives a relative or friend who has US citizenship the right to care for minors in such an eventuality.</p> <p>\"People are terrified. They fear that they will go to the store to buy groceries and won't get home and their kids will be left alone at school,\" said Luz Santiago, a pastor in Mesa. She said she has personally handled about 50 requests for power of attorney since Tuesday.</p> <p>The show-me-your-papers clause is the most deeply contested of the provisions of SB 1070, an Arizona law that was passed in 2010 that has set the benchmark for a wave of hardline immigration laws clamping down on undocumented families that have swept across several states. Under its terms, police officers are required to investigate the immigration status of anyone they come across during normal police work and whom they suspect of being unauthorised.</p> <p>The law was snarled up in legal challenges that went up to the US supreme court. In June, the court struck down several elements of the legislation but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/ world/2012/jun/25/arizona-immigration-ruling-joy-disappointment\">allowed 'show me your papers' to go ahead pending local Arizona court approval</a>.</p> <p>That approval was granted this week and the provision is now in effect.</p> <p>Phoenix, the capital of Arizona, is already braced for the new power having witnessed the impact of heavy-handed policing for years under the direction of the Joe Arpaio, America's toughest sheriff. Groups working with undocumented Hispanics are more concerned about other smaller towns such as Flagstaff and Prescott, which have large Latino populations but no experience of police officers acting as immigration agents.</p> <p>Tucson, Arizona's second-largest city, is calling a forum next Tuesday in which community leaders will meet the police chief Roberto Villasenor to discuss implementation of the clause. Regina Romero, who sits on the city council and who has convened the meeting, said the clear fear was that police would be drawn into racial profiling.</p> <p>\"We live 45 minutes from the Mexican border, so who else other than Mexicans are you going to be picking up? You are not going to be looking for Canadians in this part of the country,\" she said.</p> <p>Alessandra Soler, head of the ACLU in Arizona, said that there was already evidence that Tucson police were making contact inappropriately with US border patrol officers even for such mundane issues as help with translation. \"It's extremely problematic when you have local police contacting border patrol when there is no good reason.\"</p> <p>The ACLU and other groups have an outstanding civil rights action against SB 1070 still lodged with the state's appeal court. That legal attempt to put a stop to 'show me your papers' will continue to pass through the courts, and the intention of opponents of the provision is to beef it up with real examples of racial profiling that might now occur under it.</p> <p><a href=\"http://respect-respeto.org/\">Lydia Guzman, the director of the hotline</a>, said the aim now was to chronicle the impact of the new law. \"The supreme court has given us the green light to present to the courts victims of racial profiling, so that's our challenge: show me the victims.\"</p>",
  "<p>An air strike on a petrol station in northern Syria has killed more than 50 people, activists have claimed. The attack took place in Raqqa province, around 100 miles (160km) east of war-torn Aleppo.</p> <p>A video posted online, which purportedly showed the aftermath, revealed a scene of devastation as locals and emergency workers scrambled amid fire and wreckage. Activists claim the petrol station was attacked on Thursday afternoon by a jet fighter that had circled above it hours before.</p> <p>The Syrian air force has been increasingly active over much of the country's towns and cities in recent months, but had rarely attacked in Raqqa. The bombing took place in Ain Issa village, around 25 miles south of the Turkish border, close to where rebels on Wedesday over-ran a border checkpoint.</p> <p>Fighting continued in Syria's two biggest cities, with suburbs of Aleppo again seeing pitched battles between regime forces backed by heavy artillery in the west of the city and guerilla forces in the east. In the capital Damascus, regime forces continued to sweep through areas that had been deemed sympathetic to opposition groups.</p> <p>Residents said jets and helicopters were a constant presence over the south-east suburb of Douma, where rebels claimed earlier on Thursday to have shot down a helicopter that had been firing on sites below.</p> <p>Syria's information minister later acknowledged that one of its military helicopters had crashed, but claimed it had done so after a grazing a passenger jet mid-air, which had later landed safely.</p> <p>Frequent attacks from above on rebel positions, often in civilian neighbourhoods, have caused immense damage in Homs, Hama and Idlib as well, where air strikes have taken place most days since mid-July.</p> <p>Violence has intensified across the country since then, with almost all parts of Syria now engaged in civil war. Rebel gains in Aleppo and Damascus during days that followed have not yielded the decisive blows that opposition commanders had expected.</p> <p>Rather regime forces, which had initially been on the back foot, have clawed back losses of territory in Damascus and are inching forward in Aleppo, where the battle is being steadily joined by militants from outside Syria, some of whom espouse global jihadism.</p> <p>Syria's national news agency said 100 such Afghan fighters had been killed in Aleppo on Thursday, a claim strongly denied by rebel leaders on the ground. The arrival of foreigners to key battlefields has been a point of contention for the Free Syrian Army, whose units are sometimes cautiously welcoming the strangers.</p> <p>\"They are trying to form their own leadership groups,\" said one rebel officer in southern Turkey. \"We won't let that happen. This is our revolution. It is not a jihad as they see it.\"</p> <p>The International Committee for the Red Cross has renewed warnings of a looming humanitarian crisis as refugees continue to stream from Syria into neighbouring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan where local authorities are struggling to provide food and shelter for them.</p>",
  "<p>Amid all the flip-flopping and dissembling of the 2012 election, it comes as a bit of a shock to hear one of the presidential candidates say that his interest in politics stemmed from the first time he smoked dope. But then there is much about Gary Johnson, the Libertarian party's nominee for the White House, that is strikingly out of the mould.</p> <p>\"I think marijuana played a role in my libertarianism, because when in 1970 I smoked it for the first time I realized that everything the government said about it was a lie,\" he said. \"You know, you smoke marijuana, you're going to go crazy, you'll want to commit crime, you are going to go to the depths and never return \u2026 None of that was true.\"</p> <p>From those teenaged dope-smoking beginnings, Johnson, now 59, went on to become a successful businessman and a Republican governor of New Mexico, and is now seeking to carry the libertarian flame lit by Ron Paul during the primary election season into November's presidential race. It's true that he and his Libertarian party are relative minnows in an election cycle dominated by big corporate money \u2013 he has raised just $2m for his presidential campaign compared to the hundreds of millions being poured into Barack Obama's and Mitt Romney's campaigns.</p> <p>But there are signs that in the key swing states where the election will be won or lost, he is having an impact that could prove important over the final 60 days of the race. Polls are so tight in states such as Ohio, Nevada, Colorado, Virginia that any deflection of votes away from the two main contenders could be significant.</p> <p><a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/09/10/spoiler-alert-poll-finds-small-following-for-libertarian-candidate/\">A CNN/ORC poll last week</a> put him at 4%, which may not sound much, but given that a number of key states are essential tied between Obama and Romney even that sliver could be crucial. The poll also found that his third-party bid, combined with Jill Stein of the Green party, is eating into Romney's support base more than it is the incumbent president's.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396442032\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/9/20/1348156424689/Gary-Johnson-004.jpg\" alt=\"Gary Johnson\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gary Johnson. Photograph: Orlando Sentinel/MCT/Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Orlando Sentinel/MCT/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That explains why the GOP is acting so aggressively against him. They have tried to keep Johnson off the ballot in at least five states \u2013 Ohio and Virginia where they have already failed to do so, and Michigan, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania where court challenges are still ongoing.</p> <p>Johnson, talking in New York where he was on a media blitz, said he was unfazed by the Republican attempts to block him. He vowed that come November he would be on the ballot in all 50 states, which is not an idle promise as he is already included in 45 states.</p> <p>\"These challenges against me are just railroad jobs: it's straight out of the Wild West. I think it's a testament to the strength of our campaign that they are going to these lengths. The Republicans are afraid of me taking away votes from Romney: that's the bottom line.\"</p> <p>He might lack the riches that Ross Perot was able to inject into his third-party bid in 1992 \u2013 an effort that helped put Bill Clinton into the White House by splitting the rightwing vote \u2013 but Johnson insists he is in this to win a few states. He cites as central targets Wyoming, Montana, Nevada and Alaska \u2013 those western states with a history of frontier individualism that renders them open to the Libertarian message.</p> <p>He may be financially weak, but Johnson does have the benefit of coming after Ron Paul's energetic primary season. Paul's platform of small government, balanced budgets, an end to the war in Afghanistan and social freedoms such as marijuana legalization was essentially the same as Johnson's now.</p> <p>\"We may communicate things differently, but I don't see any difference between us in our policies,\" Johnson says.</p> <p>Paul has notably refrained from endorsing either Romney or Johnson \u2013 a failing that Johnson puts down to the fact that Paul's son, Rand, is a Republican senator. \"I think he's between a rock and a hard place,\" Johnson said.</p> <p>Still, Johnson says that since the end of the primaries his Libertarian campaign has felt a surge of energy as Paul's dedicated army of young followers has swung behind him. \"Now that Paul's out of the race, who represents all those folks? Is it Romney, or Obama or me? Well, clearly it's me. From our vantage point, there's been a massive movement of those people to our camp.\"</p> <p>That energy could be felt on Reddit, the internet community, where Johnson held an \"I am a\u2026\" chat session on Tuesday. He received more than 6,000 questions and comments and was second most popular item on the site.</p> <p>You can see why Johnson would intrigue and inspire young voters from the answers he gave to Reddit. Such as this one: \"I put the biggest threat to America as politicians who beat their chests over the threat of drugs, the threat of the illegal immigrant, the threat of terrorism, the threat of poor healthcare, all at a cost of bankrupting America\".</p> <p>Or this: \"As the Libertarian candidate, I am the only one talking about lowering welfare spending and warfare spending in the same sentence.\"</p> <p>The disproportionate threat that he poses to Romney is surprising, because in his policies he speaks at least as powerfully to progressive Americans as to conservatives. When he was governor of New Mexico between 1995 and 2003, he explored the possibility of legalizing marijuana in the state.</p> <p>His presidential slate includes support for gay marriage \u2013 \"what you do with your life is up to you, as long as you don't harm me\", he said \u2013 an attack on Obama for his record on civil liberties, and a pledge to bring the troops immediately out of Afghanistan.</p> <p>On the other side, while governor he famously used his veto 750 times \u2013 \"Governor Veto\" they called him \u2013 and he is committed to balancing the federal budget, overturning Obamacare and turning the health system over to the free market.</p> <p>\"The majority of Americans are fiscally responsible and socially accepting. I'm in that category of people \u2013 I think I'm representative of the majority of people in this country.</p> <p>\"Yet these people are let down by the two-party system. You've got Democrats that are supposed to be good on civil liberties but haven't been so good of late, and Republicans who are supposed to be good on dollars and cents but I'm not sure they have ever really been good at that. Combine them both, and arguably that's me.\"</p> <p>His big picture hope is that his presence in the race will open up political debate in the US, so that currently taboo subjects become acceptable in public discourse. \"I want to get enough votes to create a political safe ground,\" he said.</p> <p>\"So that Republicans think: gee! We can talk about having a truly balanced budget, and Democrats can actually talk about ending the wars and the drug war. That way we can change the world.\"</p>",

  "<p>Ken Clarke has either not done his homework or is being extraordinarily disingenuous in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/19/justice-and-security-bill-on-track\" title=\"\">his defence of the government's justice and security bill</a>, which is designed to prevent the disclosure of any sensitive or embarrassing information in the hands of MI5 and MI6.</p> <p>Referring to the plan for proposed secret courts, he says: \"I am on the right track ... Clearly any suggestion that these closed hearings would make anything secret that is in the public domain now is emphatically wrong.\" This is thoroughly misleading and he must know it.</p> <p>Obviously anything now in the public domain cannot be put back in a bottle marked \"secret\". Presumably what he means is that the bill will not lead to the suppression of the kind of information which has been disclosed in the past. That is also seriously misleading.</p> <p>Ministers say the bill is needed to prevent information from being disclosed in civil cases, in the face of demands for compensation from those people \u2013 specifically UK citizens and residents secretly rendered to Guant\u00e1namo Bay \u2013 suing the security and intelligence agencies. Clarke notes that such cases of alleged mistreatment have risen substantially as a result of Tony Blair's \"disastrous 'war on terror'\".</p> <p>The government has recently agreed to a number of out-of-court settlements rather than have its dirty washing revealed in public. More cases are in the pipeline. The government now proposes that any evidence, or indeed rebuttal, of abuse could in future be heard in court \u2013 but only in secret.</p> <p>But the bill is also the result of MI5, MI6, and CIA fury at the way senior judges have ruled that information showing how they colluded in the abuse and inhuman treatment \u2013 and, according to evidence heard in court, torture \u2013 of UK resident Binyam Mohamed should be disclosed.</p> <p>Such damaging information in the hands of the security and intelligence agencies must never be disclosed again, MI5 and MI6 told ministers. The Justice and Security Bill is designed precisely to stop any such disclosures from happening in the future.</p> <p>The kind of information that would be suppressed under the bill would include MI6 collusion in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/apr/18/jack-straw-libya-rendition\" title=\"\">rendition of Libyan dissidents</a> to Colonel Gaddafi's secret police, and MI5 passing information to Gadaffi's officials about Libyan dissidents in the UK \u2013 evidence that came to light only because Nato bombs blew open the offices and filing cabinets of his security and intelligence agents.</p> <p>Clarke argues that the bill \"for the first time extend[s] civil justice into the most secret activities of the state\". Leaving aside that there are precedents \u2013 such as the Special Immigration Appeal Commission (Siac) \u2013 the fact is that such \"secret activities\" under the bill would remain secret, with neither the claimant nor his or her lawyers able to hear, let alone rebut, any material provided by the spooks.</p> <p>Clarke says an \"independent advocate\" would be in court to represent the claimants. In the consultation exercise prior to the bill's publication, the majority of these special advocates \u2013 security-cleared barristers who appear in sensitive cases already used in Siac hearings \u2013 described the government's proposals as \"inherently unfair\".</p> <p>During Lords debates on the bill this summer, the government suggested that the mere fact of a secret court case taking place could be kept secret (on the model of superinjunctions), and that it could lead to people detained in prison and denied the ancient writ of habeas corpus.</p> <p>Clarke says that, \"Judges and not the executive will have to take the key decisions about whether a closed hearing is justified.\" However, the bill gives the judge little choice but to accept a minister's claims that information must be kept secret on grounds of \"national security\" \u2013 a claim which judges have traditionally (and perhaps understandably) have been very reluctant to question.</p> <p>As David Anderson QC, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, pointed out when questioned in parliament in June: \"Under the procedure devised in the bill, the judge does have the last word,\" he said. \"The only difficulty is that that word is dictated to the judge by the secretary of state \u2026 The judge's hands are effectively tied.\"</p> <p>\"I am instinctively liberal,\" says Clarke. His liberal reputation is no doubt why David Cameron has ensured he remains responsible for the bill though he is no longer justice secretary.</p> <p>He appears to be setting aside his liberal instincts, just as the Liberal Democrat conference threatens to do next week in Brighton. The latest conference agenda reveals an attempt to quash a motion calling for the withdrawal of the bill.</p> <p>The original motion called on all Lib Dem MPs to oppose the measure. An amendment has now been tabled backing the bill, and saying only that secret court hearings should be used as a \"last resort\" and \"to the bare minimum necessary to safeguard national security\". Such comforting but damagingly misleading words are precisely those deployed by Clarke and his fellow ministers.</p>",
  "<p>Charlie Richardson, who has died of peritonitis aged 78, was the head of&#xa0;the notorious Richardson gang, the main criminal rivals to the Krays in the 1960s. In&#xa0;1967 he was sentenced to 25 years following the so-called \"torture trial\" in which it was alleged that the gang's victims were subjected to horrific violence.</p> <p>The son of a prizefighter, Richardson was born in Twickenham, south-west London, and was first in trouble as a&#xa0;teenager for stealing a car. He worked briefly as an ice-cream salesman before being unwillingly called up for national service. During his induction interview, an officer asked him if he would give information to the Russians, to which he replied: \"Fucking right I&#xa0;would.\" He&#xa0;then cut up his uniform and pretended to be mad.</p> <p>It was in Camberwell, south London, that he, with the help of his brother, Eddie, built his empire, part legal through scrap metal and foreign investments and part illegal, through frauds, protection rackets and clubs, one of them at Elephant and Castle, cheekily named the Reform Club, where rough justice was delivered to people believed to have \"taken a liberty\".</p> <p>More businesslike than the Krays, Richardson had an office in Park Lane and at one point was making millions. He benefited from the protection of&#xa0;corrupt police officers and later said that \"the most lucrative, powerful and extensive protection racket ever to exist was administered by the Metropolitan police \u2026 sometimes we would pay people to be 'found' committing small crimes so that our friendly local protection racketeer in blue could have somebody to arrest and look like he had been busy\".</p> <p>The Richardsons clashed with the Krays and there were two related killings in 1966: a Kray associate, \"Dickie\" Hart, was shot dead at Mr Smith's club in Catford, south London, and a member of the Richardson gang, George Cornell, was murdered by&#xa0;Ronnie Kray at the Blind Beggar in&#xa0;east London.&#xa0;</p> <p>Richardson lived briefly in Canada but returned to the UK and embarked on a series of frauds involving bogus businesses and insurance scams. After&#xa0;visiting South Africa, he realised there was money to be made there in mining and exporting perlite. He&#xa0;also became involved with the South African secret service and was reported, in&#xa0;Robert Parker's book Rough Justice (1981), to have organised break-ins at the&#xa0;London offices of the Anti-Apartheid Movement and Amnesty International on their behalf. He became involved with conmen, including Jack&#xa0;\"the Rat\" Duval, which eventually led to his downfall. Angry that they could not find Duval, whom Charlie believed had&#xa0;defrauded him, the Richardsons seized one of&#xa0;Duval's associates, Lucien&#xa0;Harris, and&#xa0;administered a brutal punishment.</p> <p>This violence gradually caught up with them. On the morning of the day that England beat West Germany in the 1966 World Cup final, Richardson and 10 others, including \"Mad\" Frank Fraser, were arrested in a swoop. At&#xa0;the subsequent trial, the prosecuting counsel, Sebag Shaw, told the jury: \"This case is not about dishonesty and fraud, it is about violence and threats of violence, not \u2026 casual acts of&#xa0;violence committed in sudden anger or alarm but vicious and brutal violence systematically inflicted deliberately and cold-bloodedly and with utter and&#xa0;callous ruthlessness.\"</p> <p>Although Richardson claimed that the extent of the beatings had been exaggerated and that Harris \"didn't even need an aspirin\", the Old Bailey heard a&#xa0;very different account. Harris claimed that Richardson had shoved hot scampi in his eye and then subjected him to the torture of the \"black box\". Wires were attached to his genitals and electric shocks delivered before he was stabbed in the foot by one of Richardson's henchmen. Richardson then gave him \u00a3150 and a clean shirt, as was his custom. A beating from the Richardsons was known as \"taking a shirt from Charlie\".</p> <p>Richardson was convicted and sentenced to 25 years by the judge, Sir&#xa0;Frederick Lawton, who told him: \"One is ashamed to live in a society with men like you \u2026 It must be made clear to all those who set themselves up as gang members that they will be struck down by the law as you will be struck down.\" Richardson claimed that his conviction was inevitable: \"After all the publicity and lies, it would have been like having Caligula, Genghis Khan, Hitler and Stalin all in one box and taking the lid off and letting them scuttle away.\" Some of his gang admitted routinely snapping people's toes with pliers and pulling their teeth out and it was claimed that troublesome victims had their feet nailed to the floor.</p> <p>He absconded from open prison in 1980 but was rearrested and then finally released after serving 18 years, to be met by a Rolls-Royce and a welcome home party of champagne and lobsters. In 2009 he applied without success to the Criminal Cases Review Commission to have his conviction quashed, claiming that the judge's father, a prison governor, had previously been assaulted by Fraser on Wandsworth Common, thus tainting the trial.</p> <p>Richardson's autobiography, My Manor, was published in 1992, and he went into legitimate business in the City, which he claimed was much more dishonest than anything he had been involved in before.</p> <p>He was married and had six children.</p> <p>\u2022 Charlie Richardson, gangster and&#xa0;businessman, born 1934; died 19&#xa0;September 2012</p>",
  "<p>On the <a href=\"http://www.shell.com/home/content/future_energy/meeting_demand/arctic/\" title=\"\">Shell's website</a>, there is a section devoted to the company's operations in the Arctic. Decorated with beautiful images of glistening, lunar-like landscapes and indigenous people riding with huskies, it looks a bit like a travel guide \u2013 there's even a paragraph entitled The Alaska Experience.</p> <p>But beneath this pristine wilderness, Shell estimates, lies \"around 30% of the world's undiscovered natural gas and 13% of its yet-to-find oil \u2026 around 400bn barrels of oil equivalent, 10 times the total oil and gas produced to date in the North Sea\".</p> <p>Unfortunately for Shell, which has reportedly spent six years and \u00a32.8bn on Arctic exploration, things aren't going to plan. This week <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7c50d102-00bc-11e2-8197-00144feabdc0.html#axzz270GW34ol\" title=\"\">it announced it will not be drilling for oil or gas in the Chukchi Sea</a> this year, since equipment built to contain oil spills was damaged during a test.</p> <p>It isn't the only company to have struggled against the ferocious Arctic conditions. BP indefinitely suspended a $1.5bn offshore <a href=\"http://www.scotsman.com/business/energy-and-utilities/shell-puts-freeze-on-exploration-in-controversial-waters-of-the-arctic-1-2530759\" title=\"\">oil project</a> in Alaska this year, while Russian state-owned Gazprom has also stopped a gas project owing to spiralling costs.</p> <p>Nature itself may have thwarted the fossil fuel industry's biggest dinosaurs for the time being, but as long as they have permission to explore, the threat to this delicate region remains immense. Now we need politicians to start taking responsibility.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/20/mps-demand-moratorium-arctic-drilling?intcmp=122\" title=\"\">a hard-hitting report published on Thursday</a> by parliament's cross-party environmental audit committee, of which I am a member, MPs are taking a stand and calling on the UK government to push for a moratorium on all oil and gas drilling in the Arctic.</p> <p>It highlights the fact that conventional oil spill response techniques have not been proven to work in such severe conditions. In the evidence sessions that put together their report, it became blindingly obvious that the infrastructure to mount an effective clean-up operation in the event of an Arctic oil spill simply doesn't exist. All the more shocking was the industry's laissez-faire attitude to this fact.</p> <p>An evidence session with Peter Velez, Shell's upstream global emergency response manager, found that the company is completely unable to show that they have made any estimate of clean-up costs should a worst-case scenario happen in the Arctic.</p> <p>Velez said: \"The way that I look at it is that I don't look at the clean-up cost. I look at what is required to make sure that we have the best available oil spill response equipment out there to respond to a spill.\"</p> <p>When I pressed him, he continued: \"We do not place a cost on that because our responsibility, in the unlikely case that we have an oil spill, is to clean it up and we are going to do whatever it takes to clean up.\"</p> <p>This approach to a potential disaster in one of the world's most fragile and ecologically important areas is in itself incredibly irresponsible. But given the impact that such a disaster would have on its shareholders, it's even more extraordinary that Shell won't make a financial estimate of the cost of a worst case scenario.</p> <p>The committee also investigated the profound impact that climate change is already having on the area. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as anywhere else on the planet, with average warming of 1-2C since the 1960s and an accompanying loss of sea ice extent of 4% per decade.</p> <p>The committee heard that a collapse in summer Arctic sea ice, increased methane emissions from thawing permafrost, melting of the Greenland ice sheet and changes to the thermohaline circulation could all have serious consequences \u2013 pushing up sea levels and transforming weather patterns.</p> <p>So not only do drilling operations pose a threat to the physical landscape of the Arctic, the obsession with burning every last bit of fossil fuel in the Earth risks accelerating those deeply worrying changes taking place in the global climate.</p> <p>As the committee heard, there are already more proven fossil fuel reserves in the world than can be burnt safely if we want to keep global temperature rises below dangerous thresholds.</p> <p>These facts should be a wake-up call to all governments that we need to phase out fossil fuels fast. But instead we are witnessing a reckless gold rush as companies and governments make a grab for the untapped oil and gas reserves \u2013 drawing much needed investment away from the clean, home-grown, renewable energies that are readily available and will last long into the future.</p> <p>Unless a pan-Arctic oil spill response standard is put in place, together with a stricter financial liability regime for oil and gas operations requiring companies to prove they can cover the costs of cleaning up, no government should even entertain the idea of giving the go ahead for further exploration.</p> <p>The UK government must now respond to the findings of this report and show vital leadership by doing all it can to urgently secure a moratorium on Arctic drilling. I would suggest it starts with the companies registered in this country.</p>",
  "<p><em>You joined the Green party when you were 15. What were the values that you saw in the party then that made you make that decision?</em></p> <p>The key realisation was that we live on a planet with limited resources, on which you can't have unlimited growth. To sum it up in one image: the Greens had a poster at the time which said: \"We've only borrowed the Earth from our children.\" That single sentence still sums up the philosophy of my party for me. We need responsible lifestyles: we need to make sure that we don't use up the resources that belong to other generations, but also that we don't use up the resources of other countries. Fairness shouldn't end on Germany's doorstep.</p> <p>The nice thing is that the idea of sustainability translates very well from ecology to economics. It's in the DNA of my party that we aren't just OK with the idea of a balanced household budget, but that our very founding philosophy tells us that we shouldn't burden the next generation with mountains of debts.</p> <p><em>How has the Green party and their typical voter changed since then?</em></p> <p>The Greens are more at ease with German society and its values: this is our country, not an enemy we have to fight against. We want to change and improve this country because we like it. And society as a whole has become greener too. When I joined, I would have never believed that the world's fourth largest economy would eventually agree to phase out nuclear energy \u2013 and that even though the Greens were in opposition. What used to be considered alternative ideas are now mainstream policy.</p> <p><em>For example?</em></p> <p>When I was young, I used to collect rubbish in my home town and recycle in my spare time. At school I had learned how hard and energy-inefficient it was to produce aluminium, and how hard to break it down again. So my friends and I developed a concept whereby we would start aluminium collection points around the town and then take the bins to collection points outside the city. My mother used to curse me, because we ended up with piles of aluminium in our basement. But eventually the local council cottoned on to the scheme and started doing the same thing professionally.</p> <p><em>Why is the Green party so much more successful in Germany than in the UK?</em></p> <p>I wouldn't say that. Let's not forget that the British Greens once got 15% at European elections \u2013 we've never managed that much. The French managed more than 16%. Feeling a bond with nature isn't a uniquely German phenomenon. Of course, the debates can run differently at times. For example, the debate on nuclear power takes on a different course in Germany \u2013 the famed \"German angst\" does play a role, and I think that's correct. In the UK, the nuclear debate is more of an argument about cost. But that's not to say that the end results aren't similar: ie, that hardly anyone builds nuclear power stations these days. Everyone is more realistic about the dangers of nuclear.</p> <p><em>How would you sell the benefits of wind energy to the Brits?</em></p> <p>That's easy. It's not about ecology: there are pragmatic economic reasons for taking wind energy seriously. Onshore wind energy is cheaper and faster; offshore is more expensive and takes longer to build. It's that simple. For those who think it spoils their view of the landscape: would you rather have a nuclear power station plonked in the middle of the countryside? I find that logic strange. And of course no one in the Green party thinks you should just put windfarms anywhere \u2013 there are parts of the countryside that should be off limits.</p> <p>In the past, the energy market in Germany used to be run by four big players. Since the shift to renewables that we helped to bring about, regional authorities and cities council have become empowered to act as players in their own right, buying back the networks that they sold to private companies in the past. In Germany, a large number of windfarms are regionally owned: that helps to decentralise power and encourages competition.</p> <p><em>What do you say to critics of Germany's nuclear phaseout, who argue that it will merely end up having to import more dirty coal energy from abroad?</em></p> <p>We are looking at a third industrial revolution, and just as there were once those who opposed the invention of the steam engine, there are now those who hark back to nuclear energy. In Germany we now have just over 20% of our energy coming from renewable sources. All predictions from the past have turned out not to be true: when I went to school, my teachers used to say that maybe, just maybe we might have 3% of renewable energy one day. Angela Merkel says we'll have 35% by 2020; we at the Green party say it'll be 45%. My guess is: we'll both be wrong, because it'll be even more than that.</p> <p>And at any rate, don't listen to what Cem \u00d6zdemir has to say on this, don't listen to what the Greens have to say, listen to what Siemens is doing. Siemens are not switching from nuclear to clean energy because they want to lose money: they want to make profit. And I'd warn anyone who questions whether they'll manage: industrial policy, that's one thing the Germans know how to get right. If the Brits would rather hand the first mover advantage down to us, then so be it \u2013 as a German, I thank them for it. We already cater for many of the markets for renewable energy around the globe, and our future competitors are more likely to come from China than from the other side of the Channel.</p> <p>In Germany, industry is now starting to thank us for pestering in the past, because it forced them to go through the kind of innovations that the rest of the world is now catching up with. The Brits are still discussing whether they should insulate their houses better in the future, and we insulate them.</p> <p><em>Germany is proud of its export industry. But in order to make Europe work, doesn't Germany need to start importing more as well?</em></p> <p>I don't think it's a matter of either/or. The traditional left's mistake is that they've only read half of Keynes, namely the first bit about not making a recession worse by trying to save money. You learn that in the first term at university. But the second part of what Keynes says, that you have to pay your debts back in the end, that bit isn't so easy. It's a nice idea, but in reality no one does it \u2013 especially when you're dealing with four- to five-year electoral cycles.</p> <p>Germany's mistake under Merkel has been to assume that a country like Spain can get rid of its debt problem purely through austerity. So it's not a matter of \"either/or\", but a matter of \"and\": we need debt brakes, but also a long-term perspective for growth. And in order to get there, you have to deal with bad interest rates: our suggestion would be a \"sinking fund\" to pay down excessive sovereign debt in the eurozone.</p> <p><em>When, or if Europe emerges from the current crisis, what will it look like?</em></p> <p>Europe's problem isn't that Germany exports too much. The problem is that we haven't done enough to increase demand in Germany. The recent increase in pay rates was a small step, but the lack of a basic minimum wage is a problem. That's an absurd German quirk: it doesn't make sense for our British friends to have a minimum wage but not us.</p> <p>Europe's other problem is that there are some countries within the eurozone who are no longer capable of being competitive. Too much debt is certainly a problem in Greece, but not everywhere across the eurozone. Our main problem is that we need to become more competitive, and Germany shouldn't just stand by the sideline and comment but become an active member of the community.</p> <p><em>There's a theory that says we're looking at a trend towards ever smaller parties across Europe, who cater exclusively for regional and specialist interests. Is Germany on the path to Belgian conditions?</em></p> <p>That's hard to say. We saw the rise of a new party with the Pirates in Germany, but we are currently seeing a decline in their polling results. It's certainly true that the days of lifelong voter loyalty are over \u2013 all parties notice that. But you see that in Great Britain too, even if you have a majority voting system. If you look at the power of Ukip in some parts of the country, and the effect it is having on Tory policy, then you can see that even a party that gets 3-4% can wield a lot of influence. In every country in Europe there is currently a lot of insecurity, and populists are trying to exploit that.</p> <p><em>Does Germany still have a problem with the far right?</em></p> <p>We have to be honest enough to admit that there is a problem, particularly in the east. In most parts of Germany, we make a point of not entering a dialogue with the NPD [the National Democratic party] \u2013 we regard them as an anti-democratic movement. But we have to realise that there are small pockets in the country where that isn't the case, because the other parties have simply withered away. There are no short-term fixes for that, but we shouldn't ignore it completely either.</p> <p>We have to make sure that we don't just try to ban the extreme right, but also that we support those movements and those citizens that stand up to the far right. There's still plenty Germany can learn from countries who have more experience with diversity: one important step would be to make sure that the police force reflects the ethnic diversity of the population.</p> <p><em>Does Germany have a problem with the way it treats its migrant population?</em></p> <p>For a long time, Germans only knew non-whites living in Germany as <em>Ausl\u00e4nder</em>, \"foreigners\". Then they started talking about <em>Einwanderer</em>, \"immigrants\". But I'm not an immigrant, I migrated to Germany via the maternity ward of a German hospital. When I speak to my American friends and they ask me what generation immigrant I am, I tell them that in Germany, I'm considered a second-generation immigrant. But to them, I would be a first-generation immigrant, because I was born in Germany.</p> <p>When the Greens were last in government, we changed the law so that people who were born in Germany would also be legally certified as Germans \u2013 replacing a law introduced by Kaiser Wilhelm in 1913. If we win the next election, we want to extend the citizenship law further \u2013 not because we want to make things easier for immigrants, but because we think it's in Germany's interest that people who have lived in the country for a long time are recognised as citizens. Solving problems is always easier among citizens than between citizens and non-citizens.</p> <p>In 1998, I said I wished that people with a similar background to mine could play football for Germany. I got into lots of trouble for that: a lot of Germans shook their head and I got criticised in the Turkish press. And look at the national team now.</p>",

Voters may not absorb the administrative detail of a \"reform\" the chief executive of the NHS said was visible from Mars, but one thing they know: Cameron promised during the 2010 election not to cut or privatise the NHS. Those will be principal \u2013 and perilous \u2013 themes into the next election.<br>At the 2010 Tory party conference, Francis Maude said the government was relaxed about creating a postcode lottery for healthcare and other services, and that is precisely what results from the \"reforms\" now in place: as the state is rolled back, there can be no national standards. The public always strongly resents any suggestion they can get a drug or treatment in one place, but not another. New evidence emerges of the centrality of mental health, and how switching resources to psychological services could save large sums from physical healthcare budgets. But that would mean a central initiative, with the capacity to steer and reallocate. In opposition Cameron derided Labour's targets but has sought to reimpose the same 18-week maximum wait for surgery \u2013 demonstrating how often he finds centralism essential when faced with the consequences of the anarchy that characterises his competition policy.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 Disability campaigner <strong>Adam Lotun</strong>, who is <a href=\"http://adamlotun.org.uk/\" title=\"\">standing in the Corby byelection</a>.

Blogger Johnny Void, following the work and pensions secretary's appearance before a committee of MPs, says \"it's becoming near impossible to keep up\". His blog, the Void, had earlier this week reported on a warning by charity Women's Aid that Universal Credit and benefit caps <a href=\"http://johnnyvoid.wordpress.com/2012/09/18/every-womens-refuge-in-the-uk-could-close-due-to-universal-credit/\" title=\"\">could lead to every single women's refuge is the UK closing their doors</a>. But in a later post, said Duncan Smith and welfare reform minister Lord Freud <a href=\"http://johnnyvoid.wordpress.com/2012/09/19/iain-duncan-smith-fudges-on-womens-refuge-closures/\" title=\"\">hinted at a partial climbdown</a> when they appeared before the work and pensions select committee. Void writes:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are wobbles on direct payments which mean that housing payments will no longer be sent straight to social landlords but instead land in the bank account of even the most vulnerable tenants. Once again however there is no real details, merely some mumbles that some people may be taken out of this regime. How these people will be identified by the faceless computer based system which underpins the new 'digital by default' benefit system has not been explained.<br>It's clear that Iain Duncan Smith and Lord Fraud are making it up as they go along. If they weren't being paid billions of our money you might almost feel sorry for the poor bastards designing the new labyrinthine computer system which Universal Credit will depend on. Almost everyday Iain Duncan Smith moves the goal posts or adds new layers of complexity to the project which is already running behind schedule and over budget.<br>What is truly terrifying is that these problems are only just occurring to to the out of touch millionaires at the DWP. Almost any housing or social worker could have warned them about the problems which will face refuges and homeless hostels when Universal Credit goes ahead. Iain Duncan Smith has spent years plotting welfare reform yet even now he doesn't seem to have any understanding of how the system he's reforming actually works.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Other news</h2> <p>\u2022 BBC: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-19649306\" title=\"\">Poor pupils 'lose out on funding'</a><br>\u2022 Children &amp; Young People Now: <a href=\"http://www.cypnow.co.uk/cyp/news/1074685/youth-offending-teams-lose-800-posts\" title=\"\">Youth offending teams lose more than 800 posts</a><br>\u2022 CivilSociety.co.uk: <a href=\"http://www.civilsociety.co.uk/finance/news/content/13396/micro_finance_is_not_risk-free_study_concludes\" title=\"\">Micro-finance can make the poorest poorer, study warns</a><br>\u2022 Community Care: <a href=\"http://www.communitycare.co.uk/Articles/2012/09/19/118538/mid-staffordshire-inquiry-report-delayed-until-next-year.html\" title=\"\">Mid Staffordshire inquiry report delayed until next year</a><br>\u2022 Independent: <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/the-bristol-pound-is-launched-to-help-independent-retailers-8157379.html\" title=\"\">The Bristol Pound is launched to help independent retailers</a><br>\u2022 Inside Housing: <a href=\"http://www.InsideHousing.co.uk/development/campaigners-force-judicial-review-of-hmr-fund/6523812.article\" title=\"\">Campaigners force judicial review of HMR fund</a><br>\u2022 LocalGov.co.uk: <a href=\"http://www.localgov.co.uk/index.cfm?method=news.detail&amp;id=106969\" title=\"\">Study warns elderly are excluded from decision making</a><br>\u2022 Public Finance: <a href=\"http://www.publicfinance.co.uk/news/2012/09/pickles-confirms-newman-as-audit-commission-chair/\" title=\"\">Pickles confirms Newman as Audit Commission chair</a><br>\u2022 Telegraph: <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9554790/Maternity-units-must-be-closed-to-make-childbirth-safer-report-says.html\" title=\"\">Maternity units must be closed to make childbirth safer, report says</a></p> <p>\u2022 Third Sector: <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Acevo and Navca want more joint working between small and large charities</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian blogs</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog\" title=\"\">Patrick Butler's cuts blog</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/sarah-boseley-global-health\" title=\"\">Sarah Boseley's global health blog</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian on social media</h2> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SocietyGuardian\" title=\"\">Follow SocietyGuardian on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/patrickjbutler\" title=\"\">Follow Patrick Butler on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/clare_horton\" title=\"Follow Clare Horton on Twitter\">Follow Clare Horton on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/AlisonBenjamin1\" title=\"Follow Alison Benjamin on Twitter\">Follow Alison Benjamin on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/societyguardian\" title=\"Facebook page\">SocietyGuardian's Facebook page</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian links</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society\" title=\"SocietyGuardian.co.uk\">SocietyGuardian.co.uk</a><br><a href=\"http://careers.guardian.co.uk/public-sector\" title=\"Get ahead: the Guardians public and voluntary sector careers page\">The Guardian's public and voluntary sector careers page</a><br><a href=\"http://jobs.guardian.co.uk/?INTCMP=ILCJOBTXT257\" title=\"Hundreds of public and voluntary sector jobs\">Hundreds of public and voluntary sector jobs</a></p> <p>SocietyGuardian editor: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alisonbenjamin\" title=\"Alison Benjamin\">Alison Benjamin</a><br>Email the SocietyGuardian editor: <a href=\"mailto:society@guardian.co.uk\" title=\"\">society@guardian.co.uk</a></p>",

  "<p>That the last of the non-avian dinosaurs died out some 65.5 million years ago is not controversial. That this occurred largely owing to a dirty great asteroid smashing into the sea off of Mexico is also not in doubt. What remains the subject of much discussion, however, is why they went and other animals did not, or, more specifically, how do you survive a mass extinction?</p> <p>First off, the elephant in the room: luck. Often overlooked, this can play a major role. Zoos aside, all lemurs live in Madagascar, if the island was struck by a meteor tomorrow they'd all be gone instantly regardless of how well equipped they might normally be to survive such a catastrophe. It's easy enough to think of similar examples and certainly at least some groups would be doomed from such an event simply because of where they were. And on the flipside of this, some theoretically very vulnerable creatures could survive such an event by being lucky enough to live in a place untouched by it. </p> <p>Still, there are a lot of characteristics that seem to help certain animals survive mass extinctions. We can work these out by looking at what groups tend to survive global mass extinctions (or even more local ones in the modern world) and seeing what they have in common. Obviously, there will be exceptions and outliers, but as rules of thumb, the following features are the kinds of things that will help a group or species survive a major extinction event.</p> <p>Be small. If you're small you probably have a large population and thus a wider genetic diversity. Small creatures also reproduce faster than large ones allowing for rapid evolution and adaption to new conditions. And of course a small animal doesn't require as much food or resources to keep going (you can feed a lot of mice for what it'd take to keep a single elephant alive).</p> <p>Have lots of offspring. As above, having a lot of variation will help evolution along and make it more likely some will survive so pumping out the kids will help. Possums are about the same size as domestic cats but have twice as many young per litter, for example.</p> <p>Be a generalist. If you have only one source of food, or need a specific plant to shelter in, then you're doomed if that is affected or taken out. But if you can eat more or less anything that comes your way, you have a greater chance of being able to find enough to keep going through the bad times or be able to move into a new environment and survive.</p> <p>Be wide ranging. Similar to the above point, if the species has a global distribution, some are likely to reside in a spot that's largely unaffected by the crisis. If you already inhabit multiple habitats, then some will likely be less affected or you can move from one to another.</p> <p>Be free to move. An animal that can move freely will do well \u2013 it can escape the prevailing conditions and carry on. If the arctic was wiped out tomorrow, there are birds and whales that could move to the Antarctic and better conditions within days.</p> <p>Be good at surviving stress. Animals used to going for long periods without food or water (like many reptiles or hibernating mammals), or have burrows, are likely to do better than those that require copious clean water, or can only survive a few hours in the wrong temperatures.</p> <p>Put this together and it should be clear that many fish, for example, would tend to be OK in the long run if there was a disaster tomorrow. Living in water gives them an equable environment that is sheltered from change, they can move around long distances freely, often have huge populations, breed rapidly with large numbers of offspring, can eat a variety of prey, and don't require that much food. On the other hand, African rhinos, say, are large, need a lot of food, don't have a big population, breed only slowly, live in only a few tropical places and would struggle to get out of Africa and move north (or south for that matter).</p> <p>Of course all the vagaries of a global disaster and quite which environments would and would not be affected and to what degree are impossible to determine in the fossil record. However, it's because we do have an understanding of extinction survival that makes the extinction of the dinosaurs something of a mystery in the context of what did and didn't survive. It's perhaps no surprise that the giant sauropods went with their huge size and vast food requirements and relatively long generation times. On the other hand it's rather a surprise how well the amphibians did \u2013 as we are sadly seeing at the moment, they seem very vulnerable to changes in water quality and the like and are in low numbers outside of the tropics and can't cross the sea or large stretches of dry land. The real surprise of course (when looking at this coarse level of scrutiny) is that some of the small and feathered dinosaurs died out as did some early birds, when some other bird lineages survived. They were so similar in so many ways as far as we can tell \u2013 they were small, lived in similar environments, had similar reproductive strategies and the like. Perhaps it was simply luck \u2013 some birds were doing well in a location that happened to survive relatively unscathed from the impact and subsequent fallout, or were already a little better adapted to the incoming conditions. </p> <p>Such research is important as it allows us to predict which groups might need special protection as a result of the ongoing global extinction that afflicts the planet now. Resources are sadly scarce, but an understanding of what ecosystems and which species are likely to be most vulnerable from what we can see from previous global extinctions (that which killed the non-avian dinosaurs is not the only one life on Earth has suffered, merely the most recent) does have an impact on our planning. Palaeontology is a study of the past, but it can certainly provide data for the present and the future.</p>",
  "<p>In perhaps one of the biggest surprises so far in the International Cricket Council World Twenty20, India's cricketers received a scare when they narrowly defeated Afghanistan by just 23 runs, with victory looking far from certain at many points in the game. For many Afghans, the well-played match counted as a win.</p> <p>Forget the usual reminders that Afghanistan has now been at war for more than three decades. The nation has only just adopted cricket and in the last 10 years it has managed to field a team that is a serious regional contender and an underdog not to be overlooked at international tournaments.</p> <p>As the Afghan national team gears up for its next match in Colombo against England on Friday, few are expecting a victory. But for a nation recently afflicted by cricket mania, many fans say it is an honour simply to play against giants of the sport.</p> <p>\"India and England are like the grandfathers of cricket and we are like the grandsons. We're just happy to see our team on the screen playing these big countries,\" says Mohammad Rafi, a resident of Kabul who started playing cricket about a year and a half ago after seeing the success of his national team.</p> <p>For the vast majority of Afghans, cricket was an unknown game until the Soviet invasion in 1979 pushed millions of Afghan refugees into Pakistan. Many Afghans spent more than 20 years in the neighbouring country, where they adopted many local habits, including cricket.</p> <p>\"When I was a child, in the [Pakistani] village where I was living the young people of that village were playing cricket,\" says Javid Hamim, who spent nearly 25 years living in Pakistan as a refugee. \"In the beginning I didn't know anything about cricket, but after a few days I started to learn.\"</p> <p>Now Hamim, a senior news editor at Pajhwok Afghan News in Kabul, remains a devoted fan. His sons have a cricket set and take lessons, and he admits that he's been known to let them play inside the house on occasion.</p> <p>Like Hamim, most of Afghanistan's professional cricket players attribute their time in Pakistan to helping them master the game.</p> <p>Despite cricket's popularity among refugees, it has only been in the last several years that the game experienced major growth in Afghanistan.</p> <p>Shortly after the fall of the Taliban in 2001, Afghanistan became an affiliate member of the ICC. Since then the national team has managed to excel beyond even its own expectations, claiming several regional cricket cups and qualifying for the ICC World Twenty20.</p> <p>Throughout the country there are now an estimated 1 million people who play the game, according to the Afghanistan Cricket Board, and its popularity continues to grow, spurred on by the successes of the national team.</p> <p>Still, Afghanistan has struggled to host international matches inside its own borders. Even though Kabul remains relatively stable, with most fighting taking place in the Afghan countryside, most international cricket teams find that cold comfort.</p> <p>\"Many international teams are reluctant to come to Afghanistan to play with us in Kabul or other parts of the country. The main reason they give is security. But I can clearly tell everyone that cricket is a peace-building tool. No one has a problem with us, even if they are Taliban or any other anti-government element. Whenever our team wins they [anti-government groups] congratulate it and support it,\" says Hamid Shinwari, CEO of the Afghanistan Cricket Board.</p> <p>Until Afghanistan manages to host major games inside its own country, cricket fans here say they're happy to watch their team on television.</p> <p>\"Now when our own national team is playing in the big tournaments, we get really happy watching them on the TV,\" says Sadeqa, a housewife. \"When our team plays against another country we always pray for it and ask others to pray for it too.\"</p> <p><em>Zubair Babakarkhail contributed to reporting.</em></p>",
  "<h2>Thursday's best bets, by Will Hayler</h2> <p>Ayr's feature Flat racing meeting of the year has started with disappointment after overnight rain forced the abandonment of Thursday's card.</p> <p>An inspection has been called at 630am for Friday's card and the betting on Betfair as to whether the meeting will go ahead or not suggests that the chance is roughly 50/50.</p> <p>Meanwhile, at Kempton on Wednesday Richard Hughes effectively put an end to the jockeys' championship by riding a treble, taking his tally on the day to six winners. That extended his lead over the sidelined Ryan Moore to 34 and it's now hard not to see how Hughes won't have the title dead and buried by the end of this month, effectively meaning that he won't have to trawl around the all-weather tracks when the number of turf fixtures starts to trail off.</p> <p>Hughes is double heading again today, tackling Yarmouth and Kempton. <strong>Van Der Neer (2.20)</strong>, an interesting Richard Hannon-trained newcomer in the opener at Yarmouth, could be his best chance at the first track.</p> <p><strong>Flow (2.50)</strong> has some interesting newcomers in opposition in his one-mile maiden, but I fancy he will prove up to whatever is thrown at him. Very green at Epsom on his debut, he again met with defeat when well fancied at Leicester subsequently, but the form of that race is working out very well with the winner placed in Listed company since and the well-held third easily winning his maiden next time out.</p> <p>Given the improvement he showed from his first to his second start, there is every reason to expect even more here and he could well win this on his way to taking up his entry in the Racing Post Trophy.</p> <p><strong>Jawaab (4.30)</strong> has some useful old form in the book and the fitting of a visor and a switch of stable appears to have rekindled his flame. He could prove worth a small bet at Pontefract.</p> <p>I will be at Kempton to watch his stablemate <strong>Goldan Jess (7.40)</strong>, in whom a great deal of time, patience and money has been invested by my fellow owners and I. It's years since we last tasted the sweet milk of success with him, but the problems with his legs now finally seem to be in the past and we head to the races hopeful of a more encouraging showing.</p> <p>During the bleak couple of years where we have had to wait for nature to heal his injuries, we were only able to dream of getting him back to the track, so in some sense even to have him running tonight will be mission accomplished. But if he finishes in the first six, you'll find me in the bar bouncing with excitement.</p> <h2>Tipping competition - day four</h2> <p>An impressive treble from JayGee1, who found all three winners at juicy prices (7-1, 15-2 and 11-1), was not quite enough to see him hit the front with a number of you finding at least one of the trio.

  "<p>Man-made English salt marshes are failing to meet European conservation regulations that stipulate they should be as rich in plant life as natural wetlands, <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02198.x/abstract\" title=\"\">a new study warned on Thursday</a>.</p> <p>Salt marshes are coastal wetlands that are flooded and drained by salt water brought in by the tides, and are found all around the coastline of Great Britain. They are important ecosystems that provide essential food, refuge or habitat for fish, invertebrates and birds. The flowering plants that live there are very specialised, as only a few species can tolerate the salty conditions.</p> <p>Scientists from the University of East Anglia (UEA) compared the vegetation of 18 marshes created as part of man-made changes to the coastline since 1991, and 17 marshes created accidentally by storm surges since 1881, with 34 natural salt marsh sites in the UK.</p> <p>They found that the artificially created salt marshes suffered significantly reduced biodiversity. Characteristic perennial plants such as sea lavender (<em>Limonium vulgare</em>), sea thrift (<em>Armeria maritima</em>), sea arrowgrass (<em>Triglochin maritima</em>) and sea plantain (<em>Plantago maritima</em>) were very poorly represented, while shrubs such as sea purslane (<em>Atriplex portulacoides</em>) were becoming dominant..</p> <p>Under the EU habitats directive, new salt marsh must be created every time natural salt marsh is lost to coastal development or erosion caused by sea-level rise. New marshes must display \"equivalent biological characteristics\" to their natural counterparts.</p> <p>Man-made salt marshes in south England have been created by relocating sea walls inland and breaching the old, outer walls to let the sea to flood in, creating a marsh. Many accidentally created salt marshes have formed when old sea walls collapsed and let in the sea.</p> <p>While salt-tolerant (halophytic) flowering plants colonised artificially created salt marsh rapidly, the composition of these marshes was \"significantly different\" to natural marshes.</p> <p>Sediment conditions in lower-lying areas were less oxygenated than those at the same elevation in natural marshes, the study said, and man-made marshes tended to be drier. The artificial sites tended to be flat and featureless with scrappy vegetation and patches of bare ground.</p> <p>\"It is clear from our work that marshes reactivated by managed realignment do not provide habitats and species in comparable proportions to natural marshes and do not have equivalent biological characteristics. They therefore do not satisfy the requirements of the EU habitats directive,\" said the report, published in the journal of Applied Ecology.</p> <p>Lead author Hannah Mossman, of UEA's school of environmental sciences, said: \"Salt marshes such as those in north Norfolk, Essex and around much of the coast of England are loved by naturalists and tourists alike for their natural beauty plus their rare and rich ecology.</p> <p>\"These unique tidal areas also provide vital habitat for invertebrates, a staging post for migrant birds, and the only environment in which a number of salt-tolerant plants can survive.\"</p> <p>Saltmarshes protect shorelines from erosion, reduce flooding and protect water quality by filtering runoff. The south of England is naturally subsiding into the sea, and is already experiencing coastal erosion.</p> <p>\"In the face of rising sea levels, managed coastal realignment has become an increasingly important option,\" the study said.</p> <p>The report said conditions of man-made saltmarshes could be improved by additional conservation management such as manipulating the elevation or planting more mid- and upper-marsh species.</p> <p>Saltmarshes and reedbeds are at risk from land reclamation or drainage for agriculture or coastal development \u2013 around 50% of saltmarsh area worldwide has already been lost or degraded.</p> <p>The United Nations Environment Programme has urged greater protection for saltmarshes, sea grasses, mangroves and seaweeds partly because they soak up greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, helping to slow global warming.</p> <p>This week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/17/crossrail-earth-wetland-nature-reserve\" title=\"\">construction work began</a> on Europe's largest man-made nature reserve that will transform Wallasea Island in Essex into a 1,500-acre wetland.</p>",

Blithely, they accept the throne \u2013 though he's an Austrian prince, she's a Belgian princess, and they've never been to Mexico before. Max is undeterred. \"You were right in setting me on the road to <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/kera/usmexicanwar/prelude/\" title=\"Prelude to war\">my manifest destiny</a>,\"he says cheerfully to his wife.

It's easy to see why: Ju\u00e1rez is a fascinating character, born into a <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Zapotec\" title=\"indigenous pre-Columbian Thoroughly regal civilisation\">Zapotec</a> peasant family and rising to the top despite racial prejudice against indigenous Mexicans. There is something of an irony in the fact that Muni was Austrian \u2013 like Maximilian, usurping a role that it might have made sense to give to an actual Mexican. </p> <p>Worse, though, the film had to be rewritten (and renamed) to sideline the story of the emperor and empress, while a lot of Ju\u00e1rez-centric scenes were hastily shoved in. Had the writers depicted Ju\u00e1rez as a three-dimensional character, as they do the Europeans, this might have worked. They don't. He's relentlessly, boringly noble. Muni delivers a charisma-free performance in a funereal monotone, with all the emotional range of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Addams_Family#Lurch\" title=\"the ghoulish manservant\">Lurch from The Addams Family</a>. Ju\u00e1rez's real story is gripping, but worthy of a completely different film. In this one, Muni just keeps getting in Bette Davis's way.</p> <h2>Diplomacy</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396414398\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2012/9/19/1348051517403/JUAREZ-US-1939-001.jpg\" alt=\"JUAREZ [US 1939]\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">1939 Photograph: THE RONALD GRANT ARCHIVE</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: THE RONALD GRANT ARCHIVE</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>With Ju\u00e1rez's troops nearing the imperial palace, Carlotta travels back to Europe to ask Louis-Napol\u00e9on for help. At this point, you can see that this film might have been quite good if they hadn't rewritten it. Louis-Napol\u00e9on did indeed say he was ill to avoid Carlotta on her return \u2013 and, when they met, it went just as badly as it does onscreen. The real Carlotta wrote to Maximilian: \"What struck me was that I know more about China than these people here know about Mexico, where they have ventured upon one of the greatest enterprises in which the French flag has ever been involved.\" It is also true that Carlotta suffered a mental collapse and became obsessed with the idea Louis-Napol\u00e9on was trying to poison her. There was nobody in Hollywood in 1939 who could play this better than Bette Davis. There probably isn't anyone in Hollywood now who could, either.</p> <h2>Death</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396414399\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2012/9/19/1348050780158/JUAREZ-1939-001.jpg\" alt=\"JUAREZ (1939)\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">JUAREZ [US 1939] PAUL MUNI as Benito Juarez BW 1930s US POTS HORSES GUARDS CHARACTERS REAL LIFE BENITO JUAREZ WAY STATIONS Photograph: THE RONALD GRANT ARCHIVE</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: THE RONALD GRANT ARCHIVE</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>Back in Mexico, Ju\u00e1rez sends Maximilian to a firing squad. Afterwards, he goes to the church in which the ex-emperor's body is laid out, to view his foe for the first time. \"Forgive me,\" he intones, sadly. Ju\u00e1rez's real words on this occasion were recorded by one of his supporters. \"He was tall, that man, but he didn't have a good body,\" the president said. \"His legs were too long and disproportionate. He had no talent: because, although he had a high forehead, it was due to receding hair.\" Ju\u00e1rez did not regret Maximilian's execution. He published a manifesto stating that it was \"just, necessary, urgent and inevitable\".</p> <h2>Verdict</h2> <p>In trying to tell the story of Benito Ju\u00e1rez alongside that of Maximilian and Carlotta, Ju\u00e1rez doesn't entirely succeed at either.</p>",
  "<p>The premise of <em>A Possible Life</em> is existential rather than narrative. The most successful genetic mutation of all time has permitted the self-awareness that allows human beings to \"empathise, guess, manipulate, out-think, out-fight \u2013 and, where necessary, co-operate\". The physical site of this mutation is discovered in the third of the novel's connected stories, \"Everything Can Be Explained\", by a pair of young women scientists who discover that loop within the brain where the sense of selfhood is \"retuned, refined and enriched\" by memory. This story is set in the near future; other sections of the novel look back to the second world war, to a boy struggling for survival in a Victorian workhouse, to a French peasant girl's deception in the early 19th century, and to the 1970s, where a brilliant young woman singer/songwriter makes her first recordings.</p> <p>The irony with which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/sebastian-faulks\" title=\"\">Faulks</a> places co-operation last in the list of actions brought about by human self-awareness reflects a fictional world where war and the battle for survival dominate. In the first section, \"A Different Man\", Faulks returns to material he explored in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/romance/9780099394310/charlotte-gray\" title=\"\"><em>Charlotte Gray</em></a>, seasoning it with a dash of black humour reminiscent of Waugh's Sword of Honour trilogy. Geoffrey Talbot is a fine cricketer, an <em>homme moyen sensuel</em> who is bilingual by accident of upbringing, and becomes a British agent in occupied France. The territory is lightly but deftly covered, and the rather opaque character of Geoffrey is finely judged.</p> <p>However, when Geoffrey is taken prisoner, held in a concentration camp and forced to participate in Special Unit operations which include shovelling dead or not-quite-dead children into crematorium furnaces, Faulks goes beyond his capacity. In <em>Charlotte Grey</em>, his judgment was true: the little French children, Andr\u00e9 and Jacob, are fully known in their journey from family security to extermination. The novel takes them to the black mouth of Auschwitz, to disappear over its threshold with a finality that is the more memorable because Faulks understands exactly how far he can accompany these children.</p> <p>Every story within this novel bears the imprint of an extremely accomplished writer. In a sense Faulks is profligate with his own talent, and sometimes seems to put too little value on what this talent can do with idiosyncratic ease, and too much on what does not lie within its range. The workhouse child Billy in \"The Second Sister\" has a voice so compelling, self-deceiving and deeply human that most novelists would have been happy to build a whole novel around him. Faulks, however, wants something different. Billy must step back into the shadows, while the novel uses him for illustrative and thematic purposes.</p> <p>Faulks is fascinated by communal memory, and the ways in which the dissolving grains of an individual life may carry its purposes into other lives. The midden and chained dog past which Geoffrey Talbot wheels his bicycle into the French farmhouse where he will be betrayed to the Gestapo are the same midden, dog and farmhouse that betrayed the peasant girl Jeanne over 100 years earlier. The record producer and musician who tells the story of his love for the Joan Baez-like Anya King will later consider buying a flat in a former Victorian workhouse. Although it is now \"full of saunas and fitness rooms\", Billy Webb once picked oakum there, and slept in a hole in the floor.</p> <p>The cells of the past, recyled, reused, never quite destroyed, are real rather than haunting presences throughout <em>A Possible Life</em>. If matter does not disappear, then the matter that made Billy Webb is always present somewhere, exerting its influence. The cessation of an event does not bring about its ending, if it continues to throb and relive itself through memory. The whole novel is an indictment of the cod psychology that advises human beings to \"move on\", shucking off their pasts as if these were a skin rather than an impregnation of the entire being. And what is true of the individual may also be true of a culture and nation, which cannot reinvent themselves without taking account of the fabric from which they are made.</p> <p>Not to remember, of course, is to risk the demon of repetition. Many of the repetitions within <em>A Possible Life</em> are grim, but there are rare, benign presences that light up the path from one generation of betrayal to the next. In one fine scene, Geoffrey Talbot, no longer able to function under the burden of memory, is visited by a former pupil whom he once coached in cricket. The visit is everyday, even banal, but richly humane. The young man, Ched, realises that Geoffrey would like to be able to watch test cricket, and a week later, a small portable TV with a built-in aerial and earphones arrives at the asylum. Ched's detailed thoughtfulness, without attachment or expectation, is the beginning of Geoffrey's recovery. In <em>A Possible Life</em>, such moments of grace are the only relief from the treadmill of time.</p> <p>\u2022 Helen Dunmore's <em>The Greatcoat</em> is published by Hammer.</p>"
