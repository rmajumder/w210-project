  "<p>The appalling challenge of a six-month 2,000-mile walk across the south pole, in the perpetual darkness of the Antarctic winter when temperatures can plummet to -90C, proved, perhaps inevitably, irresistible to the veteran explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes.</p> <p>Fiennes' hero, Captain Robert Falcon Scott, wrote \"great God, this is an awful place\" when he finally reached the south pole a century ago, before freezing and starving to death with his team on the return journey. Apsley Cherry-Garrard called his own trek \"the worst journey in the world\". Ernest Shackleton abandoned another expedition as the weather closed in to save the lives of his crew.</p> <p>Those journeys were made in summer. Nobody before has attempted, still less achieved, crossing the pole in winter. In a prepared statement, Fiennes said: \"This will be my greatest challenge to date. We will stretch the limits of human endurance.</p> <p>\"Britain and the Commonwealth has a strong heritage of exploration, from Captain Cook 300 years ago to the present day. As such, it is fitting that a Commonwealth team should be the first to fulfil this last great polar expedition.\"</p> <p>However, in person, at the launch at the Royal Society of The Coldest Journey, Fiennes could not really explain why anyone should contemplate such a venture, still less a man aged 68 who has survived cancer, major heart surgery, and the loss of most of the frozen finger tips on one hand \u2013 which he cut off himself with a saw bought specially for the purpose. \"It's what I do,\" he said, looking slightly puzzled at the question.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396281765\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/9/17/1347906917927/Ranulph-Fiennes-graphic-n-001.jpg\" alt=\"Ranulph Fiennes graphic new\" width=\"460\" height=\"952\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Source: Guardian graphics</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian graphics</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fiennes \u2013 officially the world's greatest living explorer, according to the Guinness Book of Records \u2013 was the first, with Dr Mike Stroud, to cross the Antarctic continent unsupported; the first to cross both polar ice caps; the oldest to climb Everest, finally conquering it in 2009 aged 65 on his third attempt, after suffering a major heart attack on his first; and the first to traverse the globe from pole to pole, with the late Charles Burton. He described this trip as one of the last great challenges, \"now that everyone's grandmother goes up Everest at the weekend\".</p> <p>He admitted his wife, Louise, and six-year-old daughter are not thrilled. \"But I've never done anything else, it's how I earn my living. And you're much more likely, statistically, to die on the roads here than on the polar ice.\"</p> <p>He shrugged off suggestions he might be too old for such jaunts: \"If you're still lucky enough to be able to walk around, you might as well go for it.\" As with Scott and his great rival Roald Amundsen, who beat him to the South Pole, it was rumours of a Norwegian team preparing for the same challenge that goaded Fiennes into an expedition which he himself dismissed as impossible 25 years ago. Another Norwegian recently achieved the winter crossing of the Arctic.</p> <p>After training in the Swedish Arctic in a relatively balmy -40C, his team will sail from London on 6 December on a South African research ship, the SA Agulhas \u2013 leased at a bargain price from the South African Maritime Safety Authority.</p> <p>The ice trek proper will begin on 21 March, the equinox that marks the official start of the polar winter, from the Russia base of Novolazareskaya. Fiennes and his five team members must then climb more than 3,048 metres on to the inland plateau, trek for several hundred miles with all the supplies and equipment they need, descend another 3,000 metres, and finally cross almost another 2,000 miles to reach the Ross Sea.</p> <p>If they reach Captain Scott's old base at McMurdo Sound, via the South Pole, by the spring equinox six months later, they will still have to wait for months until the sea ice retreats enough for their ship to collect them.</p> <p>The saddest man on the ice will be Stroud, who for decades was Fiennes' joint expedition leader and medical officer. He dreamed up this adventure but finally concluded a fortnight ago that he could not join it \u2013 mainly because more than a year away from his work at Southampton University would pummel his pension entitlement.</p> <p>He will sail with them and then wave them off. He is currently desolately interviewing for his own replacement. It takes a special temperament to fit into a \"very small, very isolated group in very extreme conditions\", he said \u2013 so isolated that space travel researchers will be monitoring their progress, in a project dubbed \"White Mars\".</p> <p>His replacement must cope alone with any medical emergency \u2013 not just trivialities such as coughing blood from lungs damaged by the icy air, experienced by both Stroud and Fiennes on their last Antarctic expedition, when each was hauling 220kg of supplies. In the event of what he terms \"a howling disaster\" the team will carry a dead body with them \u2013 in cold storage, as he pointed out cheerfully.</p> <p>This time Fiennes and Stroud's replacement will lead the way on skis, towing relatively light ground-penetrating radar equipment. The radar should give the two following tractors 30 to 40 metres warning of ice crevasses, which could swallow them whole in a few seconds. The tractors are heavily modified standard machines, stripped down and rebuilt, every piece of plastic replaced with more resistant silicone, and adapted to run on aviation fuel, each towing about 70 tonnes in equipment and the living pods. The team will include an engineer and a mechanic able to make running repairs, but in the event of calamity will have to camp out until summer, the earliest a rescue mission could reach them.</p> <p>Stroud estimates each team member will need around 6,000 calories a day from freeze-dried supplies, although he and Fiennes consumed up to 11,000 calories each on their last Antarctic expedition.</p> <p>Fiennes just hopes there are good flapjacks, the highlight of each of his last days on the ice \u2013 until he noticed that Stroud was giving him a much smaller one. He demanded to be allowed to choose his own, but after a week realised that his still looked smaller.</p> <p>\"As you get hungry, it has a bad effect on your personality,\" he explained - the only glimpse he offered into the internal workings of the mind of an extraordinary man.</p>",
  "<h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jamesantle\">James Antle</a>: 'Problems with the conservative base limit his freedom'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396285838\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/06/02/james_antle_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"James Antle\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In a conference call with reporters Monday morning, the <a href=\"http://www.bostonherald.com/news/us_politics/view/20120917mitt_romney_looks_to_shift_direction_of_race/srvc=home&amp;position=recent\">Romney campaign said their candidate was getting ready</a> to release more detailed information about his plans to reduce the deficit and strengthen the middle class. As important as the plans themselves was the thinking behind this move.</p> <p>According to Romney strategist Ed Gillespie, the idea was to introduce the voters to Mitt Romney the man at the Republican National Convention. Now, as we are heading into the homestretch, Americans want to hear policy specifics from the candidates.</p> <p>This is interesting because Romney has built his campaign on several assumptions. The first is that voters wouldn't really be paying attention during the summer and would start to really focus on the race during the fall. Therefore, it was safe to allow the Obama campaign to outspend Romney 2-1 in several swing states \u2013 not counting assists from Super Pacs on both sides \u2013 and saturate the airwaves with ads, because nobody would watching. Romney would wait to open his wallet and launch his air attack when the voters were engaged.</p> <p>There's political science data that contradicts this theory, as does the recent example of John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign. Eight years ago, a shaky incumbent took to the airwaves early to define his little known and less liked challenger. Kerry never recovered. Romney is betting he'll be different.</p> <p>The second assumption is that the election will be almost entirely a referendum on Barack Obama's performance in office, and that the economy makes it very unlikely the president can be re-elected. This, too, carries risk. Romney has done relatively little to define himself or his campaign. Weak economic growth has occasionally been compatible with presidential reelection. And a large percentage of the American people still blame George W Bush for the economy. The recession didn't begin under Obama's watch, even if his policies haven't stimulated much of a recovery.</p> <p>Now Romney seems to be assuming that the remaining swing voters can be reached by filling them in on the policy details he has left fuzzy throughout the campaign. This may be due to a dent in Romney's tax advantage caused by the Obama campaign's assertions that the Republican's tax plan would raise the burden on the middle class. But there's little evidence \"low-information undecideds\" will suddenly be turned by learning how Romney would regulate energy or tweak marginal tax rates.</p> <p>The most valid of Romney's assumptions is that his problems with the conservative base limit his freedom of movement. He can't pivot \u2013 as he clearly would like to \u2013 on healthcare and immigration, and might also want to on abortion. By itself, this isn't a problem, since this is shaping up to be a base election. But it has limited Romney's ability to develop a critique of Obama that goes beyond the committed Republican voter, as evidenced even by his Cairo embassy statement.</p> <p>Internal campaign sniping aside, what Romney is left with is essentially hoping that anti-Obama sentiment is large enough to keep him within the margin of error. Then, on election day, undecided voters could break heavily enough to put him over the top. It <em>could</em> work; it could be a strategy for topping out at around 48% of the vote.</p> <p>But it doesn't seem like the ambitious pursuit of a mandate some conservatives expected when Romney tapped Paul Ryan as his running-mate.</p> <p><em>James Antle is editor of the Daily Caller News Foundation and a senior editor at the American Spectator</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/cheri-jacobus\">Cheri Jacobus</a>: 'Romney's Libya criticism could have been stronger'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396285839\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/1/3/1325610796868/cherijacobus_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Cheri Jacobus\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's reaction to the attacks and murders of American Consul to Libya Chris Stevens and several of his colleagues was not a faux pas, as Democrats and their cheerleaders in the media claim. In fact, his criticism could have been stronger for maximum impact.</p> <p>In 1980, when Iran held 52 Americans hostage, thumbing their nose at \"threats\" by President Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan sent a strong message that was unmistakable in its resolve: when Reagan became president of the United States, Iran's Ayatollah Khomeni would face the harsh reality of what a strong American president would do in the face of a hostage situation. Reagan was Carter's opponent in the election, and the incumbent president's weakness and impotence, and their danger to America, had developed into a key issue in the final weeks of the campaign. Carter, like Obama, also had failed domestically \u2013 on the economy, gas prices, and joblessness \u2013 and looked for others to blame.</p> <p>In September 1980, Carter was leading Reagan in the polls by 8 points. But in the face of domestic and foreign policy failures mirroring those of President Barack Obama today, the incumbent lost to Reagan on election day. America's choice for leadership was confirmed as the correct decision when Iran released the American hostages, just as Ronald Reagan was placing his hand on the Bible and being sworn in as president. While pro-Carter historians have twisted themselves into pretzels trying to implicate Carter as the man behind ending the hostage crisis, the facts speak otherwise.</p> <p>President Obama has proven to be weak-kneed, caving to Islamic extremists, including al-Qaida, by perp-walking an American film-maker out of his home for producing a film on Islam our enemies in the Middle East are falsely claiming as the reason for the anti-American riots and murders across the region. But the truth is beginning to haunt Obama, as we now know the attacks were planned, and the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/16/libyan-president-magariaf-military-action\">Obama administration was made aware of the impending doom</a>, but ignored the information and declined to share it with Ambassador Stevens and others.</p> <p>That President Obama chose to skip six days of security briefings during that period, and more than half in his presidency, sets him up for comparisons to failed President Carter \u2013 and for being held accountable for placing Americans overseas at risk. As it becomes apparent that President Obama misled the American public, and that Americans died as a consequence of his inaction, his presidency&#xa0;should be&#xa0;over.</p> <p>Yet the media seem to remain intent on protecting Obama, even in light of the danger his incompetence has proven to present.</p> <p>While most polls show Romney trailing Obama nationally, the most accurate from 2008, Rasmussen, shows Romney leading. However, Obama appears to have the edge in more of the key battleground states Romney needs in order to win. Despite overblown reports of the Romney campaign infighting, which nearly match recent stories about conflict among top Obama aides, the Republican nominee needs to be able to turn on a dime and fully address Obama's dangerous foreign policy \u2013 or rather lack thereof \u2013 while hitting Obama on the tanked economy, $16tn national debt, 23 milllion jobless, and Obamacare.</p> <p>In short, Mitt Romney needs to understand that the media is against him. He must not utter anything superfluous to his core message \u2013 eliminating the media's scope to focus on anything other than substance: they can't quote him on what he doesn't say. Romney's argument on substance versus Obama's lies and obfuscation will win the day.</p> <p><em>Cheri Jacobus is a Republican political strategist, pundit and writer</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/matt-lewis\">Matt Lewis</a>: 'Romney now needs strong debate performances'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396285840\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2011/4/7/1302195821539/mattlewis_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Lewis\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>If someone isn't comfortable in his own skin \u2013 if he doesn't really know who he is \u2013 everyone can tell. Campaigns are similar, and Mitt Romney's campaign has been looking self-divided lately.</p> <p>Despite a few flirtations with boldness (including the selection of Representative Paul Ryan as his running-mate), the Romney campaign always reverts to passivity. This is surprising and unfortunate, inasmuch as the boldness has usually worked. </p> <p>The strategy also seems to imply a belief in the (probably) false premise that a bad economy would automatically doom Obama \u2013 and that Romney could win by simply raising campaign cash, running perfunctory TV ads, and staying above the fray and under the radar. (Today, the theory that the 2012 election is solely a referendum on Obama seems quaint. But the Romney campaign might have been the last to notice.)</p> <p>This premise has manifested itself in various ways, including Romney's single-minded focus on the economy. Supporters call this \"message discipline\", but being elected president is about more than any one facet of political life \u2013 no matter how important that facet might be. Romney's Middle East comments last week were ill-timed, to be sure, but they were at least a recognition that the 2012 campaign is also about foreign policy, national security, and yes, even social issues.</p> <p>Interestingly, the notion that a Republican could win on the economy alone doesn't seem to jibe with history. Liberals can always promise more giveaways \u2013 a fact that can make them seem more appealing during tough economic times. Sure, Ronald Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter in 1980 because of malaise \u2013 but there was also the Iranian hostage crisis.</p> <p>To win, Romney must give voters a reason to vote <em>for him</em> \u2013 not just a reason to oppose Obama. He must present a coherent worldview that contrasts him with Obama's interrelated policies. It is important that we see his vision. And yes, there should be some specifics. The notion that he can skate by without providing details \u2013 that he can run out the clock and hope we don't check his homework \u2013 won't fly. </p> <p>There are three big moments in general election campaigns: The selection of a running mate, the convention, and the debates. In the next 50 or so days, Mitt Romney has to find a way to get his groove back \u2013 and this will clearly require strong debate performances.</p> <p>Despite the campaign infighting and ill-advised press conference during last week's Middle East turmoil, Mitt Romney can still win this election. Like a sports team on a losing streak things look bleak. But wining covers a multitude of sins.</p> <p>If Romney catches fire \u2013 which is still possible \u2013 his campaign problems suddenly look trivial. As they say, nothing succeeds like success.</p> <p><em>Matt Lewis is a senior contributor on politics to the Daily Caller</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jim-geraghty\">Jim Geraghty</a>: 'Just being \"Not Obama\" isn't going to be enough'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396285836\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/1/11/1326298456752/jimgeraghty_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Jim Geraghty\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>There are three changes the Romney campaign ought to make immediately.</p> <p>1) Enough with \"Obama isn't working.\" Yes, we know. It's obvious. No one needs to be reminded that unemployment is high. When you spend so much time repeating what everyone already knows, people begin to wonder if you really have that much else to say.</p> <p>2) The Romney campaign \u2013 Romney, most of his surrogates, and its ads and web videos \u2013 needs to connect the dots a lot more. If you watch Bill Clinton talk about a policy, there's a particular rhythm: first, here's the problem; second, here's what's causing the problem; third, here's what we're going to do; fourth, here's how it will work; and fifth, here's the result you'll see when it works. </p> <p>3) The campaign just needs to move <em>faster</em>: news cycles come and go without Romney managing to staple his agenda and ideas to the passing events. Last week would have been a golden opportunity to discuss what Romney really thinks of the Arab Spring: did America look at the uprisings in the region too optimistically? Is the Arab world ready for democracy, or is that just setting the stage for demagogues and/or Islamists? Have any of our public diplomacy efforts in recent years really paid off, or have they amounted to feelgood talk?</p> <p>And when Ben Bernanke and the Fed enacted QE3 last week, didn't that seem like a golden opportunity to showcase the Romney campaign argument about how the US economy is in a rut where all traditional methods of \"stimulus\" have proven disappointing? And how about the <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/campaign-spot/321107/scathing-fast-furious-ig-report-imminent\">expected upcoming release of the Department of Justice inspector general's report</a> on the \"Fast and Furious\" scandal? That's a perfect opportunity to make an address on the \"culture of unaccountability\" in Washington \u2013 found in the GSA (general services administration), as well as the DOJ \u2013 and how a Romney administration would fix that.</p> <p>Opportunities come and go. But the recent polling suggests that just being \"Not Obama\" isn't going to be enough this cycle.<br><em><br>Jim Geraghty writes the Campaign Spot blog for National Review Online</em></p>",

His plans were published in full<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2203826/Michael-Gove-New-rigorous-exams-abolish-GCSEs.html\"> in the Mail on Sunday yesterday</a> and the only significant new fact in the announcement was the name of the new exam, the English baccalaureate certificate. Gove said that changing the exam would enable English pupils to compete with the best in the world.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We plan to call these new qualifications - in core academic subjects - English Baccalaureate Certificates - recognising that they are the academic foundation which is the secure base on which further study, vocational learning or a satisfying apprenticeship can be built. Success in English, maths, the sciences, a humanities subject and a language will mean that the student has the full English Baccalaureate.</p> <p>Now some will argue that more rigorous qualifications in these subjects will inevitably lead to more students failing. But we believe that fatalism is indicative of a dated mind-set; one that believes in a distribution of abilities so fixed that great teaching can do little to change.</p> <p>And we know that great teaching is changing lives even as we speak. We have the best generation of teachers and headteachers we have ever had. Their excellence combined with reforms and improvements to education that this Government are making through improved teacher training, greater freedoms for head teachers and the growth of academies and free schools will mean more students will be operating at a higher level.</p> <p>So even as exams become more rigorous, more students will be equipped to clear this higher bar. Indeed, we are explicitly ambitious for all our children \u2013 and we believe that over time we will catch up with the highest performing nations and a higher proportion of children will clear the bar than now.</p> </blockquote> <p>Gove adopted a belligerent tone in his statement, accusing Labour of devaluing GCSEs by introducing modules and extending the use of coursework. But, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2162369/Michael-Gove-plans-scrap-dumbed-GCSEs-bring-O-Levels.html\">if the Daily Mail report from earlier this summer about his plans was accurate </a>(and no one is suggesting that it was not), Gove has retreated in some respects. The introduction of the new exam has been postponed and at this stage he is only proposing that pupils start studying for the English baccalaureate certificate in English, maths and science from September 2015; other subjects will follow at some unspecified point in the future.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Stephen Twigg, the shadow education secretary, has said that Labour will not support exam reform that does not benefit all pupils.</strong> Responding to Gove's statement in the Commons, Twigg said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The education leaving age is rising to 18, we need to face the challenges of the 21st century. But I simply don't accept that we achieve that by returning to a system abolished as out of date in the 1980s. Instead, we need a system that promotes rigour and breadth, and prepares young people for the challenges of the modern economy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Gove said that Twigg's comments showed that Labour was failing to embrace reform.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Teaching unions have strongly condemned the plans.</strong> Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, said: \"The secretary of state has embarked from the outset on a cynical and wholly unjustifiable attempt to discredit the quality and rigour of the GCSE qualification.\" And Christine Blower, the general secretary of the NUT, said Gove's approach was \"nonsensical\".</p> <p>That's it from me for today.

We need to raise the level of challenge in our Key Stage 4 qualifications to match the best in the world. Raising our expectations of attainment for all students will drive up standards as teaching and learning improve to <br>meet that challenge. High expectations are essential to creating a step change in standards and allowing us to keep pace with our international competitors.</p> <p>1.2. Our proposals will restore confidence by ending the perverse incentives created by the interaction of our qualifications and accountability system. At present, schools are incentivised to boost their performance by seeking examinations in which they believe their students may achieve higher grades, and Awarding Organisations have a corresponding incentive to compete for market share by <br>providing less demanding examinations.</p> <p>1.3. To remove that perverse incentive, we will move away from the competition between Awarding Organisations in the core academic subjects of English, mathematics, sciences, history, geography and languages. Instead of schools being able to choose between competing GCSEs in these subjects, a competition will be held to identify the best, single suite of qualifications in each subject offered by a single Awarding Organisation.</p> <p>1.4. We intend to use the school and post-16 accountability frameworks to incentivise schools and colleges to teach these new qualifications both at Key Stage 4 and post-16. Schools will start teaching new qualifications in English, mathematics and sciences from 2015, with students first entering the new exams in the summer of 2017. We will refocus the Department\u2019s floor standard measures which identify <br>underperforming schools to take account of performance in our new English, mathematics and sciences qualifications from 2017. The timetable for the introduction of qualifications in history, geography and languages, and the timetable for the introduction of English and mathematics post-16, will be determined following responses to this consultation.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-17T17:27:08.519Z\">at 6.27pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50574f9dc0e3d221b423ae85\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-17T16:28:15.120Z\">5.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The NUT has now issued its response to Gove's plans. Here an extract from <a href=\"http://www.teachers.org.uk/node/16543\">the statement from <strong>Christine Blower</strong>, the NUT general secretary.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is an inherent contradiction at the heart of Michael Gove\u2019s criticism of GCSEs. On the one hand the Education Secretary demands ever higher pass rates, yet when this is achieved, claims that it can only have occurred due to examinations becoming too easy. This is a nonsensical approach. Parents and carers know how hard their children work for GCSEs and how \u2018rigorous\u2019 the exams are. Ministers need to recognise that it is through sheer hard work and determination that pupils and teachers are achieving great results.</p> <p>What is being proposed here is blatantly a two-tier system. Pupils who do not gain EBacc Certificates will receive a record of achievement which will most certainly be seen to be of far less worth by employers and colleges.</p> <p>Placing a cap on those who can gain top grades means that many students will miss out on the recognition and opportunities they deserve and harks back to a time when only a few were expected to go on to higher education.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-17T17:11:57.417Z\">at 6.11pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5057465ec0e3d221b423ae75\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-17T16:18:05.780Z\">5.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's some Twitter comment on the Gove statement, which has just finished.</p> <p>From Labour's Liz Kendall</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/leicesterliz/status/247723105487843328\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Abolishing course work in qualifications except D&amp;T &amp; art is real mistake.

Too often, they have corrupted the exams, he says.</p> <p>The two-tier division of exams, into foundation and higher exams, will go, Gove says.</p> <p>And the government will end the \"race to the bottom\" that exam boards have been engaged in. In each subject areas, only one board will offer the exam.</p> <p>The new qualifications will be called English baccalaureate certificates.</p> <p>Some say this will lead to more students failing.</p> <p>But, Gove says, that reflects a fatalist mindset.</p> <p>More students will be operating at a higher level, he says.</p> <p>Gove says the government is \"explicitly ambitious\" for all children. It expects pupils to do better. All students who do GCSEs will be expected to sit the new exam.</p> <p>Students who are not able to set the new exam could sit it at 17 or 18, he says.</p> <p>Teachers will start teaching for the new qualification in English, maths and science in September 2015. Other subjects will follow.</p> <p>Gove says the coalition was left a dysfunctional legacy in exams.

Continuous assessment helps mitigate against the very many personal problems young adults begin to experience more frequently after they turn 16. Too often, teachers reading this will agree, have good pupils faltered at the last educational hurdle because of relationship, family, emotional or economic difficulties. Creating a one-off exam at the very end of studies cannot be said to accurately measure a student\u2019s ability in a particular subject. This change is devoid of compassion and shows how little Michael Gove understands the real world.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://ht.ly/dLo89\">\u2022 Fiona Millar at Local Schools Network says today\u2019s announcement should not overshadow a structural problem with the current exam system.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One fact that emerged last week has been perplexing me. Three pieces of evidence; the Ofqual letters to Edexcel leaked to the TES, the testimony of the Ofqual CEO to the Education Select Committee and the findings of the Welsh government\u2019s review into re-grading all focused on the role played by KS2 SATs results in the regulation of GCSE results. Education journalist Warwick Mansell as also written an extensive blog on this here.</p> <p>This statement on the Ofqual website summarises the situation. A prediction about GCSEs is made based on the KS2 results of the cohort in question. If that cohort exceeds expectations then the English exam regulator forces down the GCSE grades to bring them into line with predictions ...</p> <p>But if GCSE results are based on KS2 predictions, how can schools do what is expected of them in terms of the performance tables, RAISEonline and Ofsted? All these key measures of accountability rest on how well schools enable their pupils to make progress from KS2.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50572cfcc0e3eb823e694807\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-17T14:00:31.698Z\">3.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is from Greg Hurst, the Times' education editor</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GregHurstTimes/status/247693635578105856\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>So the new exams to replace GCSEs in core subjects are to be called the English Baccalaureate Certificate (EBC)</p>&mdash; Greg Hurst (@GregHurstTimes) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GregHurstTimes/status/247693635578105856\" data-datetime=\"2012-09-17T13:48:59+00:00\">September 17, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-17T14:58:07.445Z\">at 3.58pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50572caa58f9cf283191bdc1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-17T13:59:08.316Z\">2.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Leighton Andrews</strong>, the education minister in the Welsh government, told the World at One that Michael Gove's plan to replace GCSEs sounded like \"a backwards step for England\". <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-19620759#?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter\">There's a story about his comments on the BBC's website. </a>Here's the key quote.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It sounds to me as though it's a backwards step for England to be honest.

Schools will be already ready to teach these exams. We had the same issue when we came into office; we were unhappy with the modular GCSE English that was starting to be taught in September 2010.

Asked if the government would delay universal credit, he said it was \u201con track\u201d to be implemented according to the current timetable. The government was \u201c100% committed\u201d to universal credit, he said.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Number 10 said the government\u2019s voluntary approach to getting more women on to company boards was working.</strong> Since March this year women have accounted for 44% of all appointments to FTSE 100 directorships, the spokesman said. Women now comprise 17.3% of FTSE 100 boards, compared with 12.5% in February 2011, <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/news/topstories/2011/Feb/women-on-boards\">when Lord Davies published a report recommending a voluntary approach to increasing the number of women on company boards. </a>The issue came up when the spokesman was asked about today\u2019s FT story saying that Britain will succeed in blocking an EU plan to impose a quota.

While until this moment the Tory guns have been silent, Tory operators have not been idle. They have been carefully researching Labour\u2019s weaknesses. Lessons have been learnt from the 1996 to 1997 period when the Conservative Party never settled on a consistent critique of Tony Blair. There\u2019ll be no return to the counter-productive demon eyes campaign. There will just be three endlessly repeated messages and they\u2019ll be delivered whenever possible by trusted surrogates.</p> <p>The ammunition has been loaded into the cannons, the carriage turned towards the enemy and the command to fire will soon be issued. Target one is Labour\u2019s borrowing plans. Using estimates from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, there\u2019ll be a campaign reminiscent of the famous tax bombshell posters from 1992. It will be directed at Labour\u2019s implicit plans to borrow \u00a3200 billion more. Target two will be Labour\u2019s opposition to the coalition\u2019s caps on benefits and immigration. Mr Osborne, in particular, sees these issues as possessing the potential to drive a wedge between Mr Miliband and Labour\u2019s heartland, blue-collar voters.</p> <p>Finally, there\u2019ll be a focus on the Labour leader himself. I\u2019m reassured that the negativity won\u2019t be personal but it will focus on Mr Miliband\u2019s opposition to all of the coalition\u2019s big deficit-reducing measures.

This is how he replied.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I would be advocating ramping up where we are. How you do that, whether it is along the lines of what the Turks have suggested, which is you create zones of immunity \u2013 these are questions that we should debate. What I\u2019m certainly very alarmed at the propsect of is the notion that we just leave that now. The consequences of that will be very brutal and very bloody for all the people there.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the anti-Islamic film that has generated protests throughout the Muslim world was \u201claughable\u201d.</strong> When it was pointed out that Salman Rushdie had described it as \u201ccrap\u201d, Blair said: \u201cHe\u2019s absolutely right. The film is, it may be wrong and offensive, but it\u2019s also laughable as a piece of film-making.\u201d</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the Arab world faced a battle between \u201cthe forces of modernisation\u201d and \u201cvery powerful forces of reaction\u201d.</strong> (In the UK he used to call them the \"forces of conservatism\".) It was important for the forces of modernisation to win, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the end we need both the leadership within those countries and within Islam to stand up and say, \u2018Look, there is a proper modern way of reconciling religious faith, democracy in society\u2019, and we need ourselves from the outside to engage with this process of change in a way that\u2019s constructive.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the emerging democracies in the Arab world had to learn that democracy was a value system, not just an electoral system.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We need to be saying to people who are starting with their democracy: \u2018democracy\u2019s not just a way of voting, it\u2019s a way of thinking; the test of a democracy is how you treat the minority as well as how the majority comes to power'.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-17T11:53:24.363Z\">at 12.53pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5056d1b358f9cf283191bd92\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-17T07:45:48.859Z\">8.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Michael Gove will be in the Commons at 3.30pm announcing details of his plans to replace GCSEs in England with a more rigorous exams.

Giving evidence to the Commons education committee last week, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/blog/2012/sep/12/michael-gove-gcse-grading-politics-live#block-5050592b58f98e4e461a862e\">Gove refused to condemn ministers who leak announcements in advance to the media</a> and argued that if he were to discuss his plans with someone (a Mail journalist?) in confidence, he could not possibly be held responsible for what they might do with that information.</p> <p>Gove has drawn up his plans with Nick Clegg and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/sep/16/nick-clegg-michael-gove-gcse-replacement\">today they will be presenting this as a joint initiative. </a>The two men are not holding a press conference, but they are visiting a school together and footage from the visit will be released to the broadcast media.</p> <p>I will be covering the announcement, and the reaction to it, in full.

  "<p>Relatives, friends and associates of hundreds of political activists and human rights campaigners held in Burmese prisons are waiting for details of a new official amnesty which, according to state television, could see more than 500 detainees set free.</p> <p>Though Monday's announcement by the information ministry did not identify the prisoners, officials from Burma's main opposition party said the move could mean all remaining political prisoners would be freed.</p> <p>The release is the latest in a series of measures by the government of President Thein Sein, who has pledged to open up the once-isolated south-east Asian state.</p> <p>It comes a day after Aung San Suu Kyi, Nobel laureate and leader of the opposition National League for Democracy (NLD), arrived in the US for a major tour, during which she is expected to meet President Obama.</p> <p>The 67-year-old, who spent more than two decades either under house arrest or too fearful to leave Burma in case the government would never let her return, in May travelled abroad for the first time in 24 years, to Thailand. In June she visited the UK and European countries on a triumphal tour.</p> <p>Aung San Suu Kyi was on Tuesday due to meet the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, in Washington, where, later this week, she will receive the congressional gold medal, the highest honour granted by the US congress.</p> <p>She will also visit exiled Burmese activists in New York, where she lived for two years in the late 1960s while working at the UN.</p> <p>Sein is due to travel to New York later this month to address the UN general assembly for the first time as president.</p> <p>Sein's political prisoner amnesties \u2013 alongside other reforms such as new media laws and a move to a restricted form of democracy \u2013 have helped to convince western nations to suspend many of the sanctions imposed against the previous military-led regime.</p> <p>Many of those released in the most recent amnesty are likely to be petty criminals. However, there are hopes that most, if not all, of the several hundred dissidents still held will also be freed. There are somewhere between 200 and 700, according to estimates.</p> <p>Naing Naing, a central executive committee member of the NLD, said he understood 424 political detainees were being freed in the latest amnesty and that the party was \"optimistic that these are the remaining political prisoners\".</p> <p>Thin Thin Aung, of the Women's League in Burma, who lives in Delhi, told the Guardian she had heard from friends that political prisoners were to be released. \"We should know more tomorrow,\" she said.</p> <p>Analysts say the release is aimed at preparing the ground for Sein's trip to the US. A series of top-level western diplomats have visited Burma this year and repeatedly emphasised the need to free detainees, many held after cursory trials and in poor conditions. The Burmese president will be allowed to venture outside UN territory in New York after Washington issued a waiver on visa restrictions.</p> <p>Most sanctions on Burma, which was ruled for 49 years by an authoritarian junta, have been suspended since April in recognition of its political, economic and social reforms. Washington has eased some embargoes in the past few months, including some covering investment, but the senate finance committee opted in July to extend a ban on Burmese imports to maintain pressure on the government to reform.</p> <p>Burma wants that ban, as well as similar restrictions by the EU, to be lifted in order to attract foreign firms to the country to set up manufacturing operations and create jobs for a population that is among Asia's poorest.</p> <p>Michael Kugelman, analyst at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars in Washington, said that Sein wanted \"to demonstrate that Burma is ready to do business with the world\".</p> <p>Banks, construction firms, hotel chains and telecommunications companies, both global and regional, have already expressed keen interest in the new market being opened up.</p> <p>For US policymakers, improving relations with Burma, which has vast natural resources and occupies a key location \u2013 neighbouring emerging powers China and India \u2013 is also an important strategic goal.</p> <p>\"The US is turning towards the Asia-Pacific region in a way it has not done for a long time, but with all the euphoria in Washington about how fast these changes in Burma are happening it has to be remembered that there are still political prisoners, the army is still extremely violent and sadistic and the treatment of ethnic minorities is terrible,\" Kugelman said.</p> <p>Monday's amnesty came as Human Rights Watch reiterated calls for political prisoners to be released, accusing the government of \"dragging its feet rather than fulfilling its promises\".</p>",
  "<p>\"You want to run for president?\" asked the New York Times columnist Frank Bruni in his book Ambling into History. \"Here's what you need to do.</p> <p>\"Have someone write you a lovely speech that stakes out popular positions in unwavering language \u2013 and less popular positions in fuzzier terms. Better yet, if it bows to God and country at every turn: that's called uplift. Make it rife with optimism, a trumpet blast not just about morning in America but about a perpetual dazzling dawn. Avoid talk of hard choices and daunting challenges; nobody wants those. Nod to people on all points of the political spectrum \u2026 Add a soupcon of alliteration. Sprinkle with a few personal observations or stories: it humanises you. Stir with enthusiasm.\"</p> <p>So it was at the beginning of the year, as the Republicans competed to see who could paint the gloomiest picture of Barack Obama's America, that Obama reached back for the signature theme of his 2008 campaign: hope. Seeking to channel Ronald Reagan's re-election theme of 1984, when the nation was emerging from economic crisis, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/01/us/politics/president-offers-theme-of-nation-seeing-comeback.html\">he used his state of the union speech in January to claim: \"America is back\"</a>. \"Anyone who tells you that America is in decline, or that our influence has waned, doesn't know what they're talking about,\" he said.</p> <p>He test-drove the phrase in a range of settings. \"I placed my bet on the American worker,\" <a href=\"http://www.freep.com/article/20120228/NEWS15/120228026/President-Barack-Obama-UAW-speech\">he told a union conference in DC a month later</a>. \"The American auto industry is back.\" A month after that, at a fundraiser in Houston, he told donors: \"The recovery is accelerating. America is coming back.\"</p> <p>This was by no means an absurd claim. By February there had been three straight months of employment growth; the final quarter of 2011 showed a spike in consumer borrowing, signalling more consumption and more lending. In the spring, many felt they witnessed the green shoots of economic recovery. And electorally it seemed like a smart claim, too. American voters may want politicians to ponder their fragility, but they've never been particularly keen on them actually reflecting it. The country was emerging from two failed wars and the most severe recession since the Great Depression. Confidence in America's political and financial classes was shattered; assumptions about its military supremacy were dented. <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/151979/national-satisfaction-slightly-start-2012.aspx\">According to Gallup</a>, the last time most Americans were satisfied with the&#xa0;direction the country was heading in was January 2004 \u2013 and that stint of optimism lasted less than a week. The Republicans were wedded to the notion that under Obama America was in decline. Rick Santorum claimed it was an election \"to save the soul of America\" \u2013 prompting the question: well, then, who had lost it? \u2013 while Mitt Romney insisted he'd return the nation to a day when \"each of us could walk a little taller and stand a little straighter\". Obama's message was: \"Walk tall. We're on our way.\"</p> <p>There was only one problem. People did not believe it. In February, <a href=\"http://www.greenbergresearch.com/\">Greenberg, Quinlan, Rosner Research</a> focus-grouped four different ways of framing the nation's economic trajectory. Two concentrated on the enduring struggles of American middle-class families, and two claimed recovery was under way. The two that did best argued: \"This is a make-or-break time for the middle class, and for all those trying to get into it.\" The one that tested worst, by a considerable margin, claimed: \"America is back\".</p> <p>\"America is not back,\" Stanley Greenberg, GQR's chief executive, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/01/us/politics/president-offers-theme-of-nation-seeing-comeback.html\">told the New York Times</a>. \"We have long-term fundamental problems. If you look at our data and history, it takes a long time before job numbers translate into accepting at a personal level that things are better.\"</p> <p>Indeed, if anything, Americans felt they were going backwards. Most believe young people will have a worse life than their parents, and a third think the country's best days are behind it. It's not difficult to see why. For 90% of Americans, wages have been effectively stagnant for the last 40 years, while median house prices have slumped 20% since 2006. Over the past decade, the cost of tuition has risen 32%, and the average healthcare premiums have rocketed 113%.<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/fed-americans-wealth-dropped-40-percent/2012/06/11/gJQAlIsCVV_story.html\"> A report earlier this year</a> revealed that between 2007 and 2010, the median American family lost a generation of wealth. With figures like that, insisting that America is back sounds more like happy talk than fighting talk.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396639801\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/9/17/1347891311374/Barack-Obama-makes-a-camp-010.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama makes a campaign stop in Las Vegas\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama: standing not on his promise, but on his record. Photograph: Getty</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Isaac Brekken/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p></p> <p>Herein lies the central dilemma for Obama's re-election. In 2008 he ran, with considerable rhetorical force, on a promise of hope and change in the midst of an economic crisis \u2013 and on his ability to bring consensus to a divided political class. But, for many, things have changed for the worse, and the country is even more polarised than when he started.</p> <p>So the substantial benefits of his presidency are not fully apparent \u2013 particularly to those most likely to have voted for him. Meanwhile, the symbolic significance of his candidacy is largely spent. You can only be elected the first black president once. His presence remains a source of great pride to many, particularly African Americans and the young. People will still travel halfway across the country on their own dime to hear him speak, and hawkers still sell T-shirts at his events. When he went to Fort Myers in Florida to speak in July, people started lining up for tickets the night before.</p> <p>But this time he's not standing on his promise, but on his record. Shortly after his inauguration, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/02/us/politics/economy-cuts-into-obamas-youth-support.html\">he told NBC</a>: \"Look, I'm at the start of my administration. One nice thing about the situation I find myself in is that I will be held accountable. You know, I've got four years. And a year from now I think people are going to see that we're starting to make some progress.</p> <p>\"But there's still going to be some pain out there. If I don't have this done in three years, there's going to be a one-term proposition.\"</p> <p>The pain is still out there, and that is precisely the proposition the Republicans are now making.</p> <p>***</p> <p>There are several ways Obama can counter this. When he first ran, few understood the depth of the economic crisis, and few could have predicted the implosion of the eurozone and the subsequent drag on the world economy. <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/14/us-usa-campaign-economy-bush-idUSBRE85D0XI20120614\">Roughly two-thirds of the country</a> still blame Bush for the state of the economy, while only half hold Obama responsible. Republicans have been both obdurate and obtuse in Congress, where approval ratings have rarely scraped 20%. The trouble is, to a sceptical ear, these sound more like justifications for why he has failed to deliver than explanations as to how he might succeed if given more time.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/dnc-2012-bill-clintons-speech-at-the-democratic-national-convention-excerpt/2012/09/05/f208865e-f7a4-11e1-8253-3f495ae70650_print.html\">Bill Clinton conceded as much</a> during his convention speech in Charlotte. \"Here's the challenge he faces,\" he said. \"A lot of Americans are still angry and frustrated about this economy. If you look at the numbers, you know employment is growing, banks are beginning to lend again, and in a lot of places, housing prices have even began to pick up.</p> <p>\"But too many people do not feel it yet. I had this same thing happen in 1994 and early '95. But the difference this time is purely in the circumstances. President Obama started with a much weaker economy than I did. Listen to me now: no president could have fully repaired all the damage that he found in just four years. If you will renew the president's contract, you will feel it. You will feel it. Folks, whether the American people believe what I just said or not may be the whole election. I just want you to know that I believe it. With all my heart, I believe it.\"</p> <p>The trouble for Obama is that not enough Americans do believe it. Stewardship of the economy is the one area where Romney has been generally outpolling him (although it has been slipping since the conventions). It is also by far the most important issue in the election. In the nine states Obama won from Republicans last time, <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/156389/Thirteen-States-Give-Obama-Majority-Approval.aspx\">his approval ratings are below 50</a>; in six they are 45 or less. <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/web/laus/laumstrk.htm\">Unemployment is higher in six of them</a> today than it was <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/laus_03112009.htm\">when he was inaugurated</a>. In the midterms, Republicans took more than 20% of the House seats from Democrats in those states. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/mar/11/obama-republican-rivals-mitt-romney\">His defeat is not just plausible; it's possible</a>. Indeed, given the metrics of unemployment, approval ratings, real disposable personal income growth per capita (what the average person has left after tax and inflation) <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/jan/10/obamas-reelection-prospects-hard-numbers\">he should lose</a>. </p> <p>And if that weren't enough, Republicans will have far more money. In 2008, Obama outspent McCain by more than two to one. He has also outspent Romney so far, although that is largely because Romney had to wait until he was formally nominated before dipping into reserves of cash. But thanks to changes in the fundraising laws that allow unlimited donations from anonymous sources, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/06/democrats-money-panic-is-obama-about-to-get-swamped-by-gop-cash/259018/\">Democrats fear being massively outspent by Republicans and their supporters this time</a>. Obama donors at the convention were asked to open their wallets with the message: \"If they outspend us by two or three times we're OK. But if it goes much beyond that we're in trouble.\" After a successful convention they came back <a href=\"http://thehill.com/conventions-2012/dem-convention-charlotte/247263-hill-poll-voters-think-second-term-undeserved\">thrilled by the speeches and daunted by the prospects</a>.</p> <p>\"If the economy is doing great then any leader looks great,\" says one of Washington's premier electoral analysts, Charlie Cook. \"And if the economy is doing lousy I think almost any leader looks bad.\" The day the Democratic convention opened, <a href=\"http://thehill.com/conventions-2012/dem-convention-charlotte/247263-hill-poll-voters-think-second-term-undeserved\">a poll showed</a> that most Americans believe the country is worse off than it was when Obama was nominated four years ago, and that he does not deserve a second term. The day after it ended, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/08/us/politics/a-day-later-its-still-the-economy.html\">the Treasury released a weak jobs report</a> signalling a feeble recovery that's close to stalling. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396639802\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/5/5/1304593224257/Barack-Obama-Joe-Biden-Hi-008.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton and others receive an update on the mission Osama bin Laden\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Situation Room in the White House.

He can point to significant achievements that would or should satisfy his base and arguably credit him with the most progressive term since Lyndon Johnson. He has appointed two women \u2013 including the first Hispanic \u2013 to the supreme court, implemented a version of healthcare reform, ended don't ask, don't tell, withdrawn combat troops from Iraq and presented a timetable for withdrawing forces from Afghanistan. He authorised the killing of Osama bin Laden, and the US's standing in the world has greatly improved since he took over among both allies and enemies alike. </p> <p>The problem is that the record Obama has does not include the single most important achievement he could hope for \u2013 improving the economic lot of the broad swathe of middle America. And the various things it does include do not add up to a narrative. (It doesn't help that the main advantages to his principle achievement \u2013 healthcare \u2013 do not kick in for another two years). This was evident at the convention, where the same laundry list of Obama's achievements (the Lilly Ledbetter Act, which protects equal pay for equal work for women; the repeal of don't ask, don't tell; Bin Laden's killing; healthcare; his executive order on young immigrants) were aired each night less as a theme than an incantation.</p> <p>It is a flaw best illustrated in <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/01/bidens-shorthand-for-obama-1st-term-osama-bin-laden-dead-general-motors-alive/\">Joe Biden's claim to donors</a> in Fort Worth, Texas, that: \"The best way to sum up the job the president has done if you need a real shorthand: Osama bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive.\" Among other problems, such a summary links a single military operation and a particular economic achievement, both of which mark progress that is both episodic and partial. A counter-summary could just as easily read: \"Al-Qaida is alive and the economy is dying.\" Moreover, it falls well short of \"We're back,\" (which is what people want to hear), let alone \"hope\" and \"change\" (which is what they heard last time).</p> <p>The greatest case for Obama's presidency so far can be summed up thus: things were terrible when I came to power, are much better than they would have been were I not in power, and will deteriorate if I am removed from power. Even if one accepts these claims as true, and understands them as important, they're a long way from the uplifting message of four years ago. Not so much \"Yes we can,\" as \"Could be worse\".</p> <p>The problem with Obama trying to echo Reagan's lines of 1984 is that Republicans can and do counter with Reagan's line from 1980, when, concluding a debate with Jimmy Carter, he asked: \"Are you better off than you were four years ago? Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the store than it was four years ago? Is there more or less unemployment in the country than there was four years ago?\"</p> <p>At the Republican convention in Tampa, this was evoked as the game-changing line gifted to Romney by history. But it only works if Reagan's quote is hacked in half. For the Gipper immediately went on to ask: \"Is America as respected throughout the world as it was? Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we're as strong as we were four years ago?\" Even with American embassies under siege, most here would give him credit for that.</p> <p>It is rare for a president to recover from this level of protracted economic distress, particularly when they brought such high hopes with them. But the last year handed Obama two crucial, mutually reinforcing tools with which he could start to build an electoral revival. The first was Occupy Wall Street, which sprouted offshoots in every state in the country, burning brightly before fading into smaller more grassroots campaigns. The occupations had no specific demands, and had no organic connection to the Democratic party. But by concentrating their ire on the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jul/15/democrats-romney-firing-obama\">inequities of the financial system and the greed of financial elites</a> \u2013 two things Obama had failed to do anything about \u2013 they shifted the target of national frustration from government to inequality.</p> <p>Polls showed a significant portion of the country agreed with its aims, with 77% believing there is too much power in the hands of a few rich people and corporations. Even as rightwing pundits and politicians mocked the protests (\"Get a job right after you take a bath,\" said Republican contender Newt Gingrich), conservative analysts noted that they had struck a chord. When rightwing pollster Frank Luntz addressed the Republican Governors Association in December, he told them: \"The public still prefers capitalism to socialism, but they think capitalism is immoral. And if we're seen as defenders of Wall Street, we've got a problem.\"</p> <p>Obama had clearly got the message. In the same state of the union speech in which he proclaimed the US to be back, he appealed directly to the 98% of the country that earns less than $250,000. \"Let's never forget,\" he said: \"Millions of Americans who work hard and play by the rules every day deserve a government and a financial system that does the same. It's time to apply the same rules from top to bottom: no bailouts, no handouts, and no cop-outs.\"</p> <p>And while there is no narrative in which to couch his first term, there is a theme for his second: fairness. Like a mantra at Charlotte, speakers argued for the middle class to have a \"fair shot\" and the rich to give their \"fair share\" as they carefully made it clear that inequality of outcome and income were tolerable so long as equality of opportunity was available. <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/transcript-elizabeth-warrens-democratic-convention-speech/story?id=17164726\">Massachusetts Senate candidate Elizabeth Warren</a> received a huge cheer when she said: \"People feel like the system is rigged against them. And here's the painful part: they're right. The system is rigged. Look around. Oil companies guzzle down billions in subsidies. Billionaires pay lower tax rates than their secretaries. Wall Street CEOs \u2013 the same ones who wrecked our economy and destroyed millions of jobs \u2013 still strut around Congress, no shame, demanding favours, and acting like we should thank them.\"</p> <p>The second gift has been Romney: a wooden candidate <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/28/mitt-romney_n_1239103.html\">whose personal wealth amounts to double the combined wealth of the last eight presidents</a> going back to Richard Nixon and yet only pays 14% tax. For if Occupy Wall Street reframed the debate, then <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jul/18/mitt-romney-turning-into-john-kerry-2012-election\">it also provided the basis to depict Romney</a> as out-of-touch magnate with a tin ear for the travails of the common man. Most of the Democratic attacks over the summer, over the firings and outsourcings at Bain Capital \u2013 the firm that Romney once ran \u2013 and over demands for his tax records, or about his wealthy donors, fit that mould. This rich guy doesn't understand you or what you're going through, and now he wants to buy the election.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396639803\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/9/17/1347892988474/Barack-Obama-and-Michelle-010.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama and Michelle at the Democratic national convention in Charlotte\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">'Barack knows the American dream because he's lived it.' Photograph: Philip Scott Andrews/Reuters</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philip Scott Andrews/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p></p> <p>By contrast, Obama has put his less fortunate roots front and centre, running not on a narrative of racial breakthrough but of class mobility. \"Barack knows the American dream because he's lived it,\" said <a href=\"http://www.twincities.com/ci_10713235\">Michelle Obama in her convention speech</a>. \"And he wants everyone in this country to have that same opportunity, no matter who we are, or where we're from, or what we look like, or who we love.\"</p> <p>So this is the central strategy of the Obama campaign: not to lift people with lofty rhetoric, but hit them with a hard choice between him and Romney, and characterise it as a choice for either greater fairness or less; for the country to go backwards or forwards; someone who understands you or someone who doesn't. That tack <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/romneys-favorability-ratings-stall/2012/08/07/b9b8c612-e0fa-11e1-a421-8bf0f0e5aa11_blog.html\">seems to be paying off</a>. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/01/us/politics/polls-give-obama-edge-in-pennsylvania-ohio-and-florida.html\">Polls show that in swing states</a>, where people are more likely to have seen the ads, they are twice as likely to see Romney's time at Bain as a reason to vote against him. Elsewhere the nation is evenly split.</p> <p>In the crucial swing states of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida, where voters were asked the question: \"Would you say that Mitt Romney cares about the needs and problems of people like you, or not?\", most said \"not\". The poll showed that 54% of likely voters in Pennsylvania, 55% in Ohio, and 49% in Florida felt that Romney did not care about their problems. The Republican convention was dedicated in no small part turning that perception around. Arguably, it didn't work.</p> <p>So while Obama is vulnerable, he is nonetheless ahead. In national polls his lead is narrow \u2013 within the margin of error \u2013 but has widened since the convention. In the swing states he is performing better. Last time around he took nine states that Republicans had won in 2004; New Mexico, Nevada, Colorado, Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, Virginia, North Carolina and Florida. But <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/president/\">according to Real Clear Politics' average of polls</a>, he leads in seven of them and trails in just two (Indiana and North Carolina). The New York Times' Nate Silver, a well-respected statistician, psephologist and <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/author/nate-silver/\">author of the Five Thirty Eight blog</a>, currently gives Obama a 75% chance of winning. And 59% of voters now believe Obama will win \u2013 although this is far more than will actually vote for him.</p> <p>So the president has plenty of wriggle room as he seeks a path to victory this time around. He could lose the marquee states of Ohio and Florida, as well as the smaller states of New Hampshire, Iowa and Indiana, and still get his second term.</p> <p>But it may not even come to that. Republicans were supposed to have picked much of the low hanging fruit clean by summer's end. But only in Indiana is Romney truly secure, while in North Carolina he is only now pulling away. Of the states Democrats won in 2004, only in Wisconsin is Obama really vulnerable. In some previously closely contested states, such as New Mexico and Pennsylvania, Romney is barely in contention. In the rest, Obama's lead is narrow (within the margin of error) but consistent and growing. <a href=\"http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/09/13/13848313-polls-obama-holds-the-edge-in-florida-ohio-and-virginia?lite\">A poll late last week</a> showed Romney trailing Obama by at least five points in Florida, Virginia and Ohio. Although Romney wouldn't have to shift the needle very far to win, he'd have to shift a lot of needles in the same direction to stand a chance. Obama has precious little reason to be complacent, but every reason to be optimistic at this stage. His response to events like the riots across the Muslim world could still shift the trajectory, as could Republicans' cash advantage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396639804\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/9/17/1347891507685/Obama-supporters-in-New-H-010.jpg\" alt=\"Obama supporters in New Hampshire\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Obama supporters in New Hampshire.

This will be no simple task. Obama has considerable work to do on this front. Unlike four years ago, <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2012/06/21/gop-holds-early-turnout-edge-but-little-enthusiasm-for-romney/\">Republican voters are more likely to say it really matters who wins this election</a>, to say they have given quite a lot of thought to the election and to have paid close attention to news about the election. Their base \u2013 white, wealthy, older people \u2013 is also more likely to turn out. The good news for the Democrats is that voters are more enthusiastic about their candidate. The percentage of people who said they strongly supported Obama was both higher than any Democratic candidate since 1988, including himself in 2008, and almost double those who strongly support Mitt Romney. The only candidate who's ever scored higher was George Bush in 2004.</p> <p>Democrat supporters also appear more engaged. <a href=\"http://pewresearch.org/pubs/2326/obama-outpaces-romney-on-social-media-election-2012-facebook-twitter-youtube\">A survey of web and social media usage by Pew</a> found that the Obama campaign posted nearly four times as much content as the Romney campaign on the web, was active on nearly twice as many platforms and prompted twice the number of shares, views and comments.</p> <p>In 2008, Obama's victory was due, in no small part, to his ability to expand the electorate by attracting constituencies that had previously been under-represented at the polls \u2013 particularly young, black and Latino voters. He did not just win them by huge margins, but <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/voting/cb09-110.html\"> managed to amplify their electoral clout</a> by motivating them to turn out in huge numbers.</p> <p>But those are the very groups who have suffered most under his presidency. Unemployment for 18- to 19-year-olds is 23.5%; for those 20 to 24 it's lower at 12.9%, but still significantly higher than the national rate of 8.2%. Black unemployment is at 14.1% \u2013 a 10% increase on when he was inaugurated. While Hispanic unemployment has remained steady, Obama has deported more undocumented immigrants than any president since the 1950s.</p> <p>Polls show Obama still holds a significant advantage among all three groups, attracting 89% of the black vote and 60% of both the Latino vote and the 18-to-29 age group. The issue is less whether those people will vote for him <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/daily/obama-s-enthusiasm-deficit-could-soon-haunt-him-20120902\">but how many will show up</a>, since all three groups are less reliable voters. \"We haven't seen much of the stimulus trickle down to our people here,\" Mark Allen, a Chicago-based community organiser who used to work alongside Obama, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/for-obama-acquaintance-change-was-not-enough/2012/08/16/92deaf86-e7d8-11e1-a3d2-2a05679928ef_gallery.html\">told the Washington Post</a>. \"I liked the community organizer Obama better than President Obama \u2026 Democrats say Barack has got 90% or whatever of the black vote wrapped up. What they don't tell you is it's 90% of those who actually come out and vote. What if it's 90% of just 30 or 40% who vote?\"</p> <p>In fact, the black turnout is the one part of his base that remains solid, but Democrats are <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/02/us/politics/economy-cuts-into-obamas-youth-support.html\">less certain of Latinos and the young</a>. In a base election, enthusiasm is key. Since black, Latino and young people live everywhere, there is not a single swing state where this is not an issue, and arguably only New Hampshire and Iowa \u2013 two of the whitest states in the country \u2013 where it is not key. This in no small part explains his decision to use the power of his office in June to halt the deportation of thousands of young undocumented immigrants \u2013 something he could have done at any time during his presidency. In an executive order he ruled that young immigrants who arrived in the US illegally before age 16 and spent at least five continuous years here would be allowed to stay and apply for work permits, providing they had no criminal history and met other criteria, such as graduating from high school or serving honorably in the military.</p> <p>This time around, he is also seeking to make inroads among white women, many of whom are turned off by Republican views on abortion and contraception, pensioners, who may be nervous about Republican plans for Medicare (both of which he lost by 53-45 in 2008), and gay voters, buoyed by his support for gay marriage and motivated by Republican opposition to it. If there is any volatility in this race, it is not about the breadth of his support but the depth of it. <a href=\"http://2012.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/09/barack-obama-likely-voters-enthusiasm-african-americans-latinos-lgbt-young-voters-turnout.php\">National polls of registered voters</a> may mostly show him with a narrow lead; but polls of likely voters often show him trailing.</p> <p>The one thing that hasn't changed since 2008 is the Democrats' emphasis on the \"ground game\" \u2013 sending volunteers out to collect information, persuade and, ultimately, ferry people to the polls. <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2012/08/29/obamas-ground-game-advantage/?print=1\">One Washington Post survey</a> showed 20% of registered voters had been contacted by the Obama campaign, compared to 13% who'd been contacted by Mitt Romney's campaign. And Democrats had been particularly effective at reaching their base. Forty-two percent of liberal Democrats said they'd been contacted, as well as 24% non-whites and 31% of the people who voted for Obama last time. </p> <p>\"This is light years ahead of where we were in 2008,\" <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/04/jim-messina-democratic-convention_n_1854481.html\">said Obama's campaign manager, Jim Messina, during a forum in Charlotte</a>. \"We are going to make 2008, on the ground, look like Jurassic Park.\" They plan to knock on more than twice as many doors and register twice as many voters as they did last time. In North Carolina they have twice as many field offices as the Romney campaign. In Ohio they have three times as many.</p> <p>If Obama were only running against Romney, his victory would be all but assured by this stage. But he isn't. He's running against the economy, and on his promise to be a transformative president in tough times. To the extent that a second-term election is a referendum on the incumbent, Obama is losing. Too many voters think he's not done enough. To the degree, however, to which any election is a choice between at least two candidates, he is winning. Enough voters feel he is better than his opponent. For now, at least, he is not so much the change they can believe in as the change agent they most believe in. And while the semantic difference is minimal, the rhetorical difference could hardly be greater.</p>",
  "<p>One hundred and fifty years ago this week occurred one of the crucial turning points of the American civil war and, indeed, of American history. Not on the battlefield, although at <a href=\"http://www.civilwar.org/battlefields/antietam.html\">Antietam on 17 September 1862</a>, a Union army forced Confederates under Robert E Lee to abandon their invasion of Maryland. Rather, it came five days later, when <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/american_originals_iv/sections/preliminary_emancipation_proclamation.html#\">Abraham Lincoln issued \"A Proclamation\"</a> warning the south that if the war did not end within 100 days, he would declare slaves in areas under rebellion \"forever free\".</p> <p>Like all great historical transformations, emancipation during the civil war was a process, not a single event. It played out over time, arose from many causes and was the work of many individuals. It began at the war's outset when slaves, ignoring Lincoln's insistence that the struggle was about national unity, not slavery, began to seek refuge behind Union lines. It did not end until December 1865, when secretary of state William H Seward announced the ratification of the 13th amendment, irrevocably abolishing slavery throughout the reunited nation. But what came to be known as the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation marked a key step in this process.</p> <p>Lincoln believed that union, not emancipation, was the lowest common denominator of public support for the war. But he also understood that slavery was the war's fundamental cause. Beginning in November 1861, he promoted a plan to encourage voluntary abolition in Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky and Missouri, the border slave states that remained with the union. The federal government would provide financial compensation to states that acted to end slavery, and would encourage the freed people to emigrate to Africa or Central America. (Lincoln had long believed that \"colonization\", as this idea was called, would benefit both races; most blacks denounced it as a denial of their right to equality in the United States.)</p> <p>On 22 July 1862, Lincoln informed his cabinet of a dramatic change in policy. He had decided to issue an order freeing all slaves in Confederate-held areas as of the following 1 January. During the previous months, he had been subjected to enormous pressure to adopt a new course. The Republican majority in Congress had pressed forward with actions against slavery \u2013 barring the army from returning fugitives, abolishing slavery in Washington, DC and, in the <a href=\"http://www.history.umd.edu/Freedmen/conact2.htm\">Second Confiscation Act</a>, freeing slaves held by Confederates if they came within Union lines.</p> <p>Lincoln signed all of these measures. With the war at a stalemate, he was increasingly convinced that the Union could not emerge victorious without making slavery a target. He was also exasperated with southerners, including the border states, who professed loyalty to the Union but insisted that slavery remain undisturbed. When a prominent citizen of New Orleans complained that the army was encouraging slaves to escape, Lincoln fired back:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"What would you do in my position? \u2026 Would you give up the contest, leaving any available means unapplied?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Not all cabinet members approved of Lincoln's decision, although all recognized its momentous significance. But Seward warned that issuing the proclamation immediately might seem as an act of desperation \u2013 he advised Lincoln to wait until the Union achieved a military victory. Lincoln put the Proclamation aside. During the next two months, he continued to affirm his previous policy regarding slavery, urging a black delegation at the White House to promote colonization among their people, and publishing a <a href=\"http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/greeley.htm\">widely-noted letter to New York Tribune editor Horace Greeley</a>, reaffirming that preservation of the Union, not abolition, was the war's primary purpose.</p> <p>Antietam provided the victory for which Lincoln had been waiting, and on 22 September 1862, he issued the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation. The document revealed Lincoln's thinking at a crucial moment of transition. He reiterated his previous commitment to monetary compensation for slaveholders whose states consented to abolition and his belief that the freed people should be colonized outside the United States. (These elements would be eliminated in the final Emancipation Proclamation.) But he made it clear that after 1 January, the Union army would be fighting not simply to preserve the Union, but to destroy the major institution of southern life.</p> <p>Lincoln's proclamation was only a warning. It did not free a single slave \u2013 that would come when the Emancipation Proclamation was issued. But contemporaries understood that the character of the civil war was about to change. Perhaps the most penetrating assessment came from Karl Marx, then writing <a href=\"http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1862/08/09.htm\">occasional dispatches from London for the New York Tribune</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Up to now, we have witnessed only the first act of the civil war \u2013 the constitutional waging of war. The second act, the revolutionary waging of war, is at hand.\"</p> </blockquote>",

  "<p>Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, who is among those forcefully pushing Greece to meet its ambitious savings targets, said that her \"heart bleeds\" for the Greeks facing hardship as a consequence of swingeing cuts.</p> <p>At a Monday press conference , Merkel told journalists she was aware that the Greek population was suffering but said it was also necessary for their wealthier countrymen living overseas to do their part to help the country stay in the euro.</p> <p>The comments came after a decision by Germany's constitutional court last week, which backed plans for the establishment of the European stability mechanism to create a \u20ac500bn (\u00a3400bn) rescue fund for the eurozone.</p> <p>Greece has faced harsh cuts during the crisis, which has seen many lose their jobs and struggle to keep homes.</p> <p>However, while Merkel's comments may seem to appear like a softening of her attitude towards Greece and its predicament, economists said the German government was unlikely to change its position on reforms.</p> <p>Klaus Schrader, deputy head of the Economic Policy Centre at the Kiel Institute thinktank, said: \"Everybody in the German government is wanting more progress, success and a willingness to enforce reforms [in Greece].</p> <p>\"It is not the fault of the Greek population, but decades of bad policy which has resulted in economic catastrophe,\" he added.</p> <p>However, Merkel's almost sympathetic outpouring will come as cold comfort for Greeks living in Berlin, who say they are suffering jibes and discrimination as more immigrants from southern Europe's struggling economies relocate to economically resilient Germany.</p> <p>Greeks who left their home country to escape the deteriorating situation of increased unemployment, cuts to services and low wages, say they have been branded as lazy and have become the butt of jokes about their finances.</p> <p>\"Sometimes when I meet German people for the first time they ask if I have money, but in a friendly way, that pisses me off,\" said Grigoris Pinakas, from the village of Leptokaria, on Greece's eastern coast.</p> <p>Like the thousands of Greeks who have gone to Germany over the past couple of years, the 29-year-old said he had difficulties finding a job that paid enough to live in Greece, but would like to eventually return home.</p> <p>\"A few times in the <em>volkshochschule</em> [adult education college] some teachers made a joke about the Greek crisis. And a Greek friend told me he could not rent an apartment because the owner thought he couldn't afford the rent,\" he added.</p> <p>Others, like 25-year-old Dimitris Soudias, who was born in Germany to Greek parents, report that they have had similar experiences. \"People make jokes when I'm with German friends here and they make comments,\" said Soudias.</p> <p>\"The stereotypes are annoying. It has changed a lot since 2008 and when it comes to politics, many Greeks are not comfortable speaking about it.\"</p> <p>According to figures from the German statistics office, there are more than 9,000 Greeks living in Berlin, with an estimated 230,000 across Germany.</p> <p>In 2011, about 25,000 Greeks registered their arrival in Germany, although experts say there could be many more.</p> <p>\"There could be around 50,000 to 60,000, with those who haven't registered,\" said social scientist Vassilis Tsianos, of the University of Hamburg.</p> <p>\"The German people are very critical about anything to do with Greece and extremely mistrustful of the fantasy of a mass Greek immigration to Germany,\" he said.</p> <p>Many Greeks blame Germany for their predicament, but many thought Germany was justified in pushing for harsh austerity measures in exchange for bailout funds.</p> <p>\"I would not criticise Germany because it is doing what it needs to: to protect its own economy and its own political future,\" said Thanasis Boucharas, 28, who has lived in Berlin for five years as a freelance photographer.</p> <p>Greeks said they blamed the Greek politicians for the problems in their debt-ridden country. They also admitted they were anxious about what would happen once the European commission, the European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund submitted their report on whether Greece would be eligible to receive the next bailout instalment.</p> <p>\"I feel betrayed by the Greek politicians, who sabotage their own country,\" said Pinakas.</p> <p>\"I feel disgusted by the European politicians and their alleged 'help' and I feel ashamed when the whole world mocks my country. But no matter what, I will always feel proud to be Greek,\" he added.</p>",
  "<p>When Spain's star bullfighter, Jos\u00e9 Tom\u00e1s, took on six half-tonne bulls in the Roman amphitheatre at N\u00eemes, southern France, fans wept and critics hailed him as a god.</p> <p>His gory trophy haul of 11 ears and one bull's tail from a single afternoon's fight on Sunday made him one of the greatest matadors ever.</p> <p>The unusual pardoning of one of his bulls, deemed too noble and brave to kill at the end of the fight, added to the legendary nature of a bullfight that propelled Tom\u00e1s's face to the front page of El Pa\u00eds, El Mundo and other major Spanish dailies on Monday.</p> <p>\"Extraordinary,\" wrote Nobel prize winner Mario Vargas Llosa, who was among those present. \"I have never seen a bullring so packed, and the people so overwhelmed.\"</p> <p>\"Some of us wept at the sight of such excellence, of perfection,\" wrote El Mundo's respected bullfighting critic, Vicente Zabala de la Serna. \"I write this with sunny tears, blinded by emotion.\"</p> <p>Write-ups of the historic fight featured, like all such reviews, in the arts pages of newspapers which still treat the bullfight as culture, rather than sport.</p> <p>Tickets had long ago sold out for the rare opportunity to see one of the greatest living bullfighters face six bulls. Most bullfights see three matadors take on two bulls each but, as the beleaguered bullfight seeks salvation from an onslaught of criticism over cruelty and dwindling public funding in crisis-hit Spain, fans saw this exceptional fight as an opportunity to stem the anti-taurine tide.</p> <p>\"Catalonia is here!\" was one of the cries heard from fans who had crossed the border from Spain's northeastern region \u2013 where bullfights no longer take place \u2013 to watch a pastime that also has roots in southern France.</p> <p>The Catalonian parliament banned bullfighting at the start of the year in response to a popular petition, but opponents questioned whether the ban was about protecting animals or about identity politics, with nationalists and separatists seeking to differentiate the region from the rest of Spain.</p> <p>Tom\u00e1s, 37, fought at Barcelona's La Monumental bullring a year ago in Catalonia's last bullfight, bringing to an end what fans said were six centuries of bullfighting in the region.</p> <p>After Sunday's performance, critics agreed that Tom\u00e1s deserves a place in the pantheon of great matadors, alongside legends such as Manolete, Juan Belmonte or Gallito.</p> <p>\"Jos\u00e9 Tom\u00e1s is an exceptional bullfighter, because of his control, his courage and his art,\" wrote Vargas Llosa in El Mundo. \"There have always been stars in bullfighting but Jos\u00e9 Tom\u00e1s is different to them all.\"</p> <p>Tom\u00e1s has long been the darling of bullfight-loving artists and entertainers. He is also a favourite in southern France, which shares the tradition of bullfighting with Spain and some South American countries.</p> <p>In recent years the number of Spanish bullfights has fallen by a third as town halls, which used to fund many of them, have run out of money. Some 1,700 fights were registered in 2010, with about 7,000 bulls killed.</p> <p>But bullfighting has received a boost from the new conservative People's party government of Mariano Rajoy, which has allowed it to be broadcast live once more on state television. TVE, the national broadcaster, had not shown a bullfight for six years until it recently changed its code of conduct, which now allows bullfights to be shown during children's viewing time.</p> <p>Tom\u00e1s has only fought a few fights this season, keeping fans yearning for more opportunities to see their idol. \"The aim is to have only a few fights, making quality the most important thing and to generate expectation and excitement,\" his manager, Salvador Boix, explained recently.</p> <p>As Spain's most popular bullfighter, Tom\u00e1s is also believed to charge the most for his services.</p> <p>\"The obvious question now is whether fans in Madrid, Seville or Bilbao will be able to see anything similar,\" commented Andr\u00e9s Amor\u00f3s, the bullfight critic for the newspaper ABC. \"Perhaps, now that TVE is back in bullrings, it could be shown live for free, so that all Spaniards can enjoy it.\"</p> <p>But those who think Tom\u00e1s might save the bullfight from decline are worried that the exact opposite could happen. Rather than providing further legendary fights, rumours are spreading that the matador, who has already had one comeback, will retire definitively.</p>",
  "<p>Is Britain becoming more anxious and less tolerant? The answer is that we are less keen on the idea of coalition government, we are less satisfied with the NHS - and we think there should be less spending on benefits. </p> <p>If you want to know what the UK thinks, you go to the British Social Attitudes Survey, <a href=\"http://www.natcen.ac.uk/\">run by NatCen</a>, which has surveyed over 85,000 people in the last three decades about their attitudes to government, morality, health and happiness. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://bsa-29.natcen.ac.uk/\">29th report this year</a> poses questions for politicians of all parties - and NatCen has given us key historic data for you to download and play with. This is what it shows.</p> <p></p> <h2><a name=\"polit\">How Britain feels about politicians</a></h2> <p></p> <p>Only 9% of us trust politicians either a great deal or a lot, compared to 58% who trust the police the same amount. One in five of us trusts governments of any party all or most of the time.</p> <p></p> <p>Meanwhile, coalition government becoming a reality has not led to fondness - the amount of people who think a coalition government is best for Britain is down from 40% in 2010 to 28% - and much lower than is high of 50% in 1995. Meanwhile, only 27% want to change the voting system, down from 41% in 2010 and the lowest score since 1983.</p> <p></p> <h2><a name=\"welfare\">How Britain feels about welfare and public spending</a></h2> <p></p> <p>Traditionally during recessions people believe the government should spend more on welfare. Not this time: only 28% believe the government should more on benefits,down on 2010 and only 1% above 2009. Before the crash in 2008, the figure was 35%.</p> <p>In the late 1990s, when people were asked if they thought the government should have the main responsibility for \"ensuring people have enough to live on if they become unemployed\", 85% of them said yes. Now that figure stands at 59%, suggesting that people are happier with outsourcing of these services than they used to be.</p> <p></p> <p>The results can be quite nuanced: people have been asked since 1983 if they thought the welfare state encourages people stop helping each other. In 2010, at the time of the last election this figure had risen to a high of 38%. It's now down to 33%. Meanwhile, 15% of the population think the creation of the welfare state is one of Britain's proudest achievements.</p> <p>There's a consensus across party support, too - with big drops in Labour and Lib Dem supporters who believe the government should be the supplier of benefits.</p> <p>But it's not a straightforward picture: After falling for nearly a decade from a high point of 63% in 2002, the proportion of people who want to see more public spending, even if this means higher taxes, rose between 2010 and 2011, from 31% to 36%. Over half (55%) would like spending levels to stay where they are.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <h2><a name=\"nhs\">How Britain feels about the NHS</a></h2> <p></p> <p>By the time Labour left power in 2010, satisfaction with the NHS had risen to an all-time high of 70%. The latest data shows it down to 58%, which is where it stood in 2008. </p> <p>People were also asked how they felt about specific services, and this shows falls in satisfaction across GPs, A&amp;E, outpatients and inpatients. The proportion of people who think things have got worse has changed too - up to 27%, which is where it stood in 2008 but not as high as the 49% of 1995. Meanwhile, ask people what the top priority should be for public spending and they say health - just above education. And 73% of people still oppose the idea of the NHS only being available free to the poorest.</p> <p></p> <h2><a name=\"immigration\">How Britain feels about immigration</a></h2> <p></p> <p>Immigration has always been a tricky issue in British politics - and the latest figures show that just over half, 51%, of the population think immigration should reduce \"a lot\".</p> <p>Having said that, the number of people who think that immigration has had a positive economic impact has risen, to around 30%, up from 26% in 2002. But then, so has the number who believe the impact has been \"very bad\" - almost doubled from 11 to 21%. Interestingly, that view is shared by 29% of first or second generation migrants.</p> <p></p> <h2><a name=\"scotland\">How Scotland (and England) feels about independence</a></h2> <p></p> <p>The survey also asked people in Scotland how they feel about independence - and asked people in England about the impact they thought it would have on them.</p> <p>A third of Scots, 32% believe the country should be \"Independent, separate from UK and EU, or separate from UK but part of EU\" - which is up from 23% in 2010 (in England, this is up to 26%). Meanwhile those who believe it should remain a part of the UK is down slightly, from 61% to 58%.</p> <p>The report also compares how Scots feel now with their expectations of devolution in 1997, just after Tony Blair's Labour came into power. Then they felt that devolution would be better for pride in country, standards of healthcare and the economy. All of those percentages are much lower for independence.</p> <p>It also shows that the majority, 63%, think Westminster should take the lead in defence and foreign affairs, rather than Edinburgh.</p> <p></p> <p>The survey also asked people in England what they thought about Scotland and independence. Some 30% thought Scots receive their fair share of government spending. But the proportion who thought it received more than its fair share is up to 44%, compared to 21% in 2000. And another 66% agree the answer to the so-called <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/jan/17/what-is-west-lothian-question\">West Lothian question</a> (<em>\"Now that Scotland has its own parliament, Scottish MPs should no longer be allowed to vote in the UK House of Commons on laws that only affect England\"</em>), the highest it has ever been. However, the majority of English people asked though that England itself should be governed in the way it is now.</p> <h2>About the survey</h2> <p>The 2011 survey consisted of 3,311 interviews with a random sample of adults in Britain. </p> <p>Addresses are randomly selected and visited by one of NatCen Social Research's interviewers. After selecting one adult at the address (again at random), the interviewer carries out an hour long interview.

  "<p><em>Today's extract from the updated edition of <strong>The phone-hacking scandal: journalism on trial*</strong> is by a media academic, <strong>Tim Crook</strong>, who argues that British journalism is now under unprecedented attack.</em></p> <p><em>He argues that the Leveson inquiry, police investigation and overall criticism means that the well-worn phrase, \"the chilling effect\", is proving inadequate to describe the current situation in which laws are already being interpreted by judges to the detriment of press freedom...</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396260137\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/17/1347886636337/HackBookFront.jpg\" alt=\"hac\" width=\"165\" height=\"250\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>There is a civil war going on in journalism. It is right against left, broadsheet against tabloid, middle class against working class, broadcast/multi-media against newspaper/online. </p> <p>Journalists and lawyers are accusing each other of committing criminal offences, civil wrongs and professional misconduct. There is no evidence of any consensus or unanimity on what should be done.</p> <p>Academics, including the rather crudely named \"hackademics\", media pressure groups, and the journalists' trade union, NUJ, actually advocate statutory involvement in print/online journalism regulation and a statutorily enforceable \"right to reply\".</p> <p>These measures are to be found in former Warsaw Pact countries struggling to re-arrange fig-leaves over their totalitarian past, failed post-colonial dictatorships and countries with post-second world war civil law jurisdictions culturally arranged to cover-up collaboration with the holocaust and Nazi occupation.</p> <p>The Leveson inquiry is costing more than the Chilcot inquiry, dealing perhaps with a higher scale of human violation and harm, and investigating a decision by this country's government to go to war with deaths and grief far beyond anything caused by a journalist's mobile phone snooping or private investigator's computer hack.</p> <p>Chilcot never dispatched section 21 orders with interrogative questionnaires demanding answers on pain of contempt prosecution.</p> <p>The counsel for \"media victims\", David Sherborne, made it very clear: 'The press is on trial here, and not simply in this room but also out there in the court of public opinion\". </p> <h2>The need to reform inquiry rules</h2> <p>In his closing address, Jonathan Caplan QC for the Daily Mail group, raised the issue of there being \"no right for core participants to cross-examine witnesses who make serious allegations against them\" \u2013 a matter for reform of the statute and rules. </p> <p>He also highlighted the fact that one of Leveson's six assessors was \"a founder, director and trustee of the Media Standards Trust, a core participant... and also a member of the Hacked Off campaign, which are both critics of popular journalism, but you were not given any assessor from the popular press.\"</p> <p><em>[Crook goes on to consider in some detail the various laws that affect journalism, such as libel, and the relatively recent outlawing of other news-gathering methods, such as phone-hacking, blagging, doorstepping and paying public officials. Then he moves on to discuss privacy actions]</em><br> Privacy in the UK is a new restriction on media conduct and content. The English judiciary decided to take control of the definition of public interest in terms of a hierarchy where priority and discretion would be exercised for broadsheet and public service media running serious and somewhat boring stories at the top, and tabloid media gossiping and exposing the tawdry though entertaining private lives of celebrity at the bottom. </p> <p>The judiciary also imported European civil law concepts of private zone of interaction, personal autonomy, equating honour, identity, dignity and respect with reputation through the power line of the 1998 human rights act and European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) case law. </p> <p>It is the English judiciary that is deciding that the betrayal of human relationships through infidelity and consumption of the sex industries \u2013 middle and upper-class exploitation of working class personal dignity \u2013 is not in \"the public interest.\" It is the judges who are deciding what is \"a reasonable expectation of privacy.\"</p> <p>The power and control is now determined by a privatised legal profession chasing the profits of privacy litigation with charges 140 times greater than the European average and judges who conceive of privacy as a cube of ice that has to be kept in the freezer of prior restraint. </p> <p>In the USA, not only is there a public interest threshold to be met on an entitlement to claim for breach of privacy, it is also a tort that is only available post-publication. </p> <p>Countries with a process of secret prior restraint to publication are, and can never be, true democracies. The existence of such legal facility is the mark of an authoritarian state infrastructure of information control and censorship.</p> <p>The ethical and legal wrongs of Hackgate happened with a backdrop of the English judiciary turning a developing media respect to the right for privacy into a notorious censorship law prohibiting the publication of truth through secret injunction, with injunctions imposed on the very existence of an injunction (the super-injunction). </p> <p>The tide is inundating the popular newspaper market competing to serve its consumers, otherwise known as \"the common people\", with stories that were water-tight and proofed in the winning of a defendant's burden of truth by securing the evidence to justify libel; only to discover that the law of privacy has holed them below the water line.</p> <h2>The new chilling effect</h2> <p>This is the new chilling effect \u2013 the prohibition on the publication of truth through secret court order on moral issues and matters that public opinion survey might well regard as matters of public debate and interest. </p> <p>And, very slowly, a minority of concerned voices in the superior broadsheet media, who always considered themselves culturally and morally superior to their scallywag brothers and sisters in the tabloids, are becoming aware of the boomerang.</p> <p>Injunctions favouring the multi-national Trafigura, notorious former Bank of Scotland Chief Executive Fred Goodwin, controversial footballer Ryan Giggs and self-confessed sex addicted American golfer Tiger Woods hardly engender much public confidence in the ability of her majesty's courts to make rulings \"in the public interest.\"</p> <p>The public debate about statutorily establishing and defining a public interest may be missing the point about comparative media jurisprudence. The closer the power and determination of public interest is in the control of state officials and legislative, executive or judicial bodies, the closer we are to jurisdictions in Russia, China and Saudi Arabia. </p> <p>Far too many potential news-gathering criminal offences have no \"public interest\" defences; thus leaving decisions on whether to prosecute or not with a state- appointed government prosecuting official (the director of public prosecutions).</p> <p>It may well be a sociological paradox that is difficult for the bourgeois broadsheet-hugging intelligentsia to accept, but the News of the World, over 168 years, fought for and spoke for the battered and proud working class who washed the doorsteps of their \"slums\" clean every morning, loyally paid their pounds, shillings and pence to the man from the PRU, migrated from servile back-breaking service in the rich peoples' town and country houses to the new jobs as clerks, telephone girls, shop assistants and managers, ribbon road factory workers in heavy and light industries and sought social mobility in wider education and the promise of lower and middle class home ownership.</p> <p>The equalising 30s, 40s, 50s and 60s of the 20th century have been replaced by inequality, narrowing opportunity, decline of meritocracy and rise of the super and ugly rich celebrocracy, avoiding taxes and concentrating their wealth in off-shore havens. </p> <p>The real cesspit of nihilist ethicism is the City world of casino banking and finance where people work the least for the most and destroy and corrupt the wider economy. </p> <p>Perhaps the NoW helped engender a little fear in the world of over-indulgent and undeserving rich and emotionally cut them down to size as well as exposing sexual corruption, exploitation and social hypocrisy. </p> <p>What was published was notoriously pompous, tawdry, salacious and wretched. Perhaps it poached more than its fair share of other people's dignity. But in \"draining the swamp\" of those who insult with intrusive truth to power, we may well have lost more than a few nasty alligators, snakes and piranhas in the journalistic Street of Shame.</p> <p><em>Tomorrow:</em> Media academic <strong>Barry Turner</strong> examines the way in which a selection of the main questions set by the Leveson inquiry have been answered</p> <p>*<em>The phone hacking scandal: journalism on trial</em>, second and updated edition, edited by Richard Lance Keeble and John Mair, will be published by Abramis on 17 September.

  "<p>Environmental protesters blasted Shell on Monday after the energy giant abandoned controversial plans to start drilling for oil in the Arctic this year when a final test of its environmental protection equipment failed to meet the standards required to gain a full drilling permit.</p> <p>The oil and gas group said a new type of \"containment dome\" \u2013 designed for use in the event of a leaking wellhead \u2013 had been damaged during testing.</p> <p>\"During a final test, the containment dome aboard the Arctic Challenger barge was damaged,\" Shell told investors in <a href=\"http://www.investegate.co.uk/Article.aspx?id=20120917070100P2F1B\" title=\"\">an update on Monday morning</a>. \"It is clear that some days will be required to repair and fully assess dome readiness.\"</p> <p>As a result Shell has been unable to secure a permit to undertake full drilling operations and will have to wait at least until after the Arctic winter to resume its efforts.</p> <p>The long-planned drilling programme in the Chukchi Sea, 70 miles off Alaska's north-west coast, has been dogged with last-minute hiccups as the company has raced to get drilling under way before the winter sets in.</p> <p>Some drilling started this month but was halted within days after it emerged that an ice floe 30 miles long and 12 miles wide appeared to be heading towards the drill ship. Progress was further hampered by efforts taken to protect local whaling operations.</p> <p>\"In order to lay a strong foundation for operations in 2013, we will forgo drilling into hydrocarbon zones this year,\" Shell said. It will continue to drill several preparatory \"top holes\" ahead of full-blown drilling operations next year.</p> <p>Responding to Shell's latest Arctic setback, Ben Ayliffe, senior Arctic campaigner at Greenpeace International, said: \"Shell has invested seven years of effort and spent the best part of $5bn on its Arctic programme, but we can now see what a monumentally reckless gamble this was. The company has nothing to show for it except a series of almost farcical safety mishaps that has left its reputation in tatters.</p> <p>\"Investors must now be asking whether investing such vast sums of money trying to exploit the fragile Arctic is really worth it.\"</p> <p>Shell still awaits a full drilling permit for its exploration programme in the area and the paperwork is dependent on successful testing of its Arctic containment system, which includes the dome. \"We look forward to the final receipt of our drilling permits for the multiyear exploration programme upon the successful testing and deployment of the Arctic containment system,\" the company said.</p> <p>Environmental campaigners have repeatedly warned about the high risks involved in Arctic drilling as well as the potentially catastrophic consequences of a spill similar to Deepwater Horizon in a region already affected by climate change.</p> <p>Asked if another major spill would destroy the company's reputation, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/16/shell-alaska-oild-drilling-resume\" title=\"\">Peter Slaiby, vice-president of Shell Alaska, recently told the Guardian</a>: \"I feel there is a hell of a responsibility on my head, but we have clear accountability models. I have the ability to do things in the right way and I have the backing of the most senior leaders in Shell to do things the right way.\"</p> <p>Slaiby had also rounded on critics, such as Greenpeace, which had raised concerns about the amount of field testing undertaken using the containment dome, also known as a \"capping stack\".</p> <p>\"We even had the director of BSEE [Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement] out with me looking at the capping stack \u2026 I find these charges [of insufficient planning] groundless.\"</p> <p>Earlier this month, the containment dome had become the focus of debate after documents obtained under a Freedom of Information Act request suggested field testing of a containment dome took place over just <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/09/shell-criticised-limited-testing-alaska-drilling-containment?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">two hours on 25-26 June</a>.</p> <p>Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (Peer), a US watchdog that helps federal and state employees raise concerns over environmental issues, said it was shocked by the single page of notes from the BSEE after it filed a federal lawsuit against the agency asking for all documents relating to the capping tests.</p> <p>\"The first test merely showed that Shell could dangle its cap in 200ft of water without dropping it,\" said Kathryn Douglass, a Peer lawyer. \"The second test showed the capping system could hold up under laboratory conditions for up to 15 minutes without crumbling. Neither result should give the American public much comfort.\"</p> <p>In its statement on Monday morning, Shell \u2013 which has spent more than $4.5bn (\u00a32.77bn) over four years preparing for work in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas \u2013 pointedly reminded investors of the importance of its Arctic drilling programme to the US economy.</p> <p>\"This exploration programme remains critically important to America's energy needs, to the economy and jobs in Alaska, and to Shell,\" it said.</p>",

Thinktank the Social Market Foundation has published a <a href=\"http://www.smf.co.uk/media/news/think-tank-reveals-universal-credit-at-risk-of-backfiring-and-pr/\">new report on the government's plans for Universal Credit</a>, and warns that the move to monthly payments could cause significant hardship for families on the lowest incomes. On the Inside Housing blog, commentator Jules Birch warns that evidence suggests the <a href=\"http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/home/blogs/runaway-train/6523755.blog\">welfare system is \"cracking under the strain\"</a> even before further cuts due next April and the phased introduction of the universal credit starting at the same time. Analysing the SMF report, alongside the new Social Attitudes survey and research by the National Housing Federation, Birch concludes: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Iain Duncan Smith and the DWP will no doubt continue to resist calls for changes and stick to their line that the universal credit will make work pay and boost personal responsibility. However, the reform is looking increasingly like a slow motion train crash that everyone else can see is going to happen.<br>Benefit cuts are already biting and are set to affect far more families from next April with the bedroom tax and benefit cap. The danger is that IDS's flagship reform will make things worse rather than better. There is still time to stop the train before it is too late. </p> </blockquote> <p>On the Shelter blog, Kate Webb predicts <a href=\"http://blog.shelter.org.uk/2012/09/uc-and-u-turns-when-to-start-worrying-about-universal-credit/\">\"the softest of soft launches\" for Universal Credit</a> and says she expects only the simplest of cases to be allowed onto UC at first. She adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Shelter has always said we support the introduction of Universal Credit in principle \u2013 the current benefits system is fiendishly complicated for many households, particularly when transitioning into paid work.</p> <p>But Ministers are perhaps now realising why no previous government managed such a radical overhaul of welfare. Delivering Universal Credit in a way that protects low income households is more important than meeting deadlines set down when UC was little more than a wonk's proposal. A collective moratorium on the term 'U-turn' as a political attack would perhaps be helpful in giving DWP the space it needs to get UC right.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile, volntary organisations in Birmingham warn that welfare reforms and the move to Universal Credit will <a href=\"http://birminghamagainstthecuts.wordpress.com/2012/09/14/welfare-reforms-make-child-poverty-target-unachievable/\">make the government target of ending child poverty by 2020 unachievable</a>.

  "<p>One of the world's leading ice experts has predicted the final collapse of Arctic sea ice in summer months within four years.</p> <p>In what he calls a \"global disaster\" now unfolding in northern latitudes as the sea area that freezes and melts each year <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/14/arctic-sea-ice-smallest-extent?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">shrinks to its lowest extent</a> ever recorded, <a href=\"http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/pw11/\" title=\"\">Prof Peter Wadhams of Cambridge University</a> calls for \"urgent\" consideration of new ideas to reduce global temperatures.</p> <p>In an email to the Guardian he says: \"Climate change is no longer something we can aim to do something about in a few decades' time, and that we must not only urgently reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions but must urgently examine other ways of slowing global warming, such as the various <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/dec/01/geoengineering-techniques-study-science-coalition\" title=\"\">geoengineering ideas</a> that have been put forward.\"</p> <p>These include reflecting the sun's rays back into space, making clouds whiter and seeding the ocean with minerals to absorb more CO<sub>2</sub>.</p> <p>Wadhams has spent many years collecting ice thickness data from submarines passing below the arctic ocean. He predicted the imminent break-up of sea ice in summer months in 2007, when the previous lowest extent of 4.17 million square kilometres was set. This year, it has unexpectedly plunged a further 500,000 sq km to less than 3.5m sq km. \"I have been predicting [the collapse of sea ice in summer months] for many years. The main cause is simply global warming: as the climate has warmed there has been less ice growth during the winter and more ice melt during the summer.</p> <p>\"At first this didn't [get] noticed; the summer ice limits slowly shrank back, at a rate which suggested that the ice would last another 50 years or so. But in the end the summer melt overtook the winter growth such that the entire ice sheet melts or breaks up during the summer months.</p> <p>\"This collapse, I predicted would occur in 2015-16 at which time the summer Arctic (August to September) would become ice-free. The final collapse towards that state is now happening and will probably be complete by those dates\".</p> <p>Wadhams says the implications are \"terrible\". \"The positives are increased possibility of Arctic transport, increased access to Arctic offshore oil and gas resources. The main negative is an acceleration of global warming.\"</p> <p>\"As the sea ice retreats in summer the ocean warms up (to 7C in 2011) and this warms the seabed too. The continental shelves of the Arctic are composed of offshore permafrost, frozen sediment left over from the last ice age. As the water warms the permafrost melts and releases huge quantities of trapped methane, a very powerful greenhouse gas so this will give a big boost to global warming.\"</p>",

  "<h2>WINNING TIP: Provins</h2> <p>This fortified medieval town is an hour and 25 minutes by train (from Gare de l'Est) to the south-east of Paris, away from the usual foreign tourist route. It's great with kids as there's a tower, ramparts and underground passages. In summer there are lots of events, such as jousting knights. There are plenty of restaurants, from good and cheap cr\u00eaperies (try La Fleur du Sel on place du Ch\u00e2tel) to fancier places with lovely outdoor dining areas. <br><a href=\"http://www.provins.net\" title=\"\"><em>provins.net</em></a><br><strong>masmingou</strong></p> <h2>North<br></h2> <p><strong>Auvers-sur-Oise</strong><br>Take the train from the Gare du Nord (one hour) to the place where Vincent van Gogh spent his last three months. Walk up past the church and along pretty backstreets to the cemetery where Van Gogh and his brother Theo are buried, taking in fabulous views of the town and countryside. Carry on alongside the iconic cornfields and drop down into the Absinthe Museum before a delicious meal and genuine absinthe at the Auberge Ravoux, where Van Gogh lived, worked and died. A wonderful day out whether you're into the painter's work or not.<br><a href=\"http://www.musee-absinthe.com\" title=\"\"><em>musee-absinthe.com</em></a><em>; Auberge Ravoux: +33 1 3036 6060, </em><a href=\"http://www.maisondevangogh.fr\" title=\"\"><em>maisondevangogh.fr</em></a><br><strong>mumfordc</strong></p> <p><strong>Rouen</strong><br>Rouen, in Normandy, is just far enough away from Paris on a fast train (70 minutes from Gare Saint-Lazare) to escape its day-trippers but not so that it would break your alarm clock or budget. Apart from having a wondrous cathedral, it is one of the homes of impressionism. Visit a gallery or head for the interesting old town to shop or people-watch from a cafe.<br><a href=\"http://www.rouentourisme.com/Default.aspx?tabid=2508&amp;language=en-US\" title=\"\"><em>rouentourisme.com</em></a><br><strong>islandover</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396240666\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/9/12/1347453066372/Monets-Garden-Giverny-001.jpg\" alt=\"Monet's Garden, Giverny\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Monet's Garden, Giverny.

A fast train from Gare Saint-Lazare to Vernon makes the journey in 45 minutes. It's a 5km traffic-free walk to Giverny, or there are regular buses from Vernon station. Whether the water lilies are flowering or not, standing in the garden of the father of impressionism is like being inside one of his paintings: the Japanese footbridge is right there in front of you. The house and garden have been restored to how they would have looked in Monet's day. <br><a href=\"http://fondation-monet.fr/uk/\" title=\"\"><em>fondation-monet.fr/uk</em></a><em>, open 1 April- 31 October</em><br><strong>lizcleere</strong></p> <p><strong>La Mer de Sable, Ermenonville</strong><br>Just 45 minutes from Paris up the A1 motorway, La Mer de Sable (The Sea of Sand) is a great escape from the capital. Built on an incredible geological site \u2013 a perfectly natural expanse of sand \u2013 it was France's first theme park when it opened in 1963 but its rides and attractions have survived the test of time. And the best bit?

There are circular walks around the forest from the railway station, which give you an immediate sense of escape from the intensity of Paris. Then you can wander through formal parkland towards the town centre for lunch, a cr\u00eape or an enormous ice-cream. The chateau, the former country escape of French royalty, offers fine gardens, a large pond, grand rooms and plenty of history.<br><a href=\"http://www.musee-chateau-fontainebleau.fr/\" title=\"\"><em>musee-chateau-fontainebleau.fr</em></a><br><strong>ladybird123 </strong></p> <h2>West<br></h2> <p><strong>Chartres cathedral</strong><br>Trains from Gare Montparnasse to Chartres take about an hour. A Unesco world heritage site since 1979, the cathedral, begun in 1145, is reckoned one of the finest pieces of Gothic architecture in the world. It is still in good condition, though some restoration is being done. The stained-glass windows, for which it is most famous, were added in the 12th and 13th centuries and are worth the trip alone: jewel-like tones flood the interior during the day, adding colour and warmth. There's a light show in Chartres during the summer, with special attention paid to the cathedral.<br><a href=\"http://diocesechartres.com/cathedrale/\" title=\"\"><em>diocesechartres.com/cathedrale</em></a><br><strong>lizcleere </strong></p>"
