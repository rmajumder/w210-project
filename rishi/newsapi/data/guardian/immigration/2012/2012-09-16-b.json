  "<p>Sometimes, the future arrives with alarming speed. In the 1990s, and again in 2000, climate scientists warned that \u2013 unless urgent action was taken \u2013 the Arctic Ocean could be clear blue water in summer by 2050. This August researchers making a <a href=\"http://www.euractiv.com/climate-environment/rate-arctic-summer-sea-ice-loss-news-514271\" title=\"\">first analysis</a> of data from the European Space Agency's observation satellite CryoSat-2 were startled to find that the loss of sea ice \u2013 as measured both by depth, and by area \u2013 was far <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/14/arctic-sea-ice-smallest-extent\" title=\"\">more dramatic</a> than <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/ice-loss-shifts-arctic-cycles-1.11387\" title=\"\">their own forecasts had predicted</a>. The summer Arctic could be an open sea within a decade.</p> <p>It is the ice cap that keeps the Arctic cold. Sunlight that hits white ice bounces back into space. Dark ocean absorbs light, and therefore warmth, making the next winter's ice pack thinner, and less enduring. The difference between the torrid tropics and the icy Arctic governs weather patterns in the northern hemisphere. The frozen ocean and permafrost at the perimeter prevents ground methane from escaping into the atmosphere and thereby accelerating global warming. The polar seas drive the marine ecosystem and fuel the north Atlantic fish stocks. So the consequences of ice loss could be considerable, although nobody with political authority seems so far to have sufficiently considered them.</p> <p>Bad news from the far north has just been matched by a bleak warning from the tropics. German, US and Australian scientists report in Nature Climate Change on Mondaythat the double menace of increasing greenhouse gas emissions and rising ocean acidity could spell the end for most of the world's coral reefs. These extraordinary and beautiful structures flourish at the limits of their tolerance. They like it hot, but not too hot. They tend to \"bleach\" and even die as temperatures rise: during 1998, 16% of all living corals perished in one exceptional tropic summer. Coral reefs deliver coastal protection, tourism and fishing for millions: the reefs are home, habitat and hunting territory for about a quarter of all marine species. The researchers used 19 different climate models to predict the effects of a 2C increase in global average temperatures, and found that by 2030 around 70% of the reefs would suffer what they politely call \"long-term degradation\".</p> <p>In fact, pessimists in the climate change community warn that within the next century global mean temperatures could rise by 6C. A <a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2012/03aug_summer2012/\" title=\"\">fierce, sustained drought in the US</a>, with 170 all-time US heat records broken in June alone, has already hurt world food stocks. The global response to these signals of potential calamity has so far been feeble. Meanwhile Britain's \"greenest government ever\" has shown what it thinks of scientific evidence, by placing a homeopathic medicine enthusiast in charge of the National Health Service, and a reputed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/sep/08/open-letter-environment-secretary\" title=\"\">climate sceptic as environment secretary</a>. The outlook is not promising.</p>",
  "<p>More people want increased public spending even at the price of higher tax rates, according to the annual <a href=\"http://www.natcen.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">British Social Attitudes survey</a>. In a possible sign of unease over the recent spending cuts, the number calling for an increase in spending and taxation to strengthen public services rose for the first time in nine years last year.</p> <p>The survey, prepared by the National Centre for Social Research, comes amid a growing feeling in Downing Street that Britain may be embarking on a slow economic recovery. Sir John Major gave voice to this view, only expressed in private by ministers, when he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/16/economy-darkest-moment-john-major?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">told the BBC on Sunday he hoped Britain had \"passed the darkest moment\"</a>.</p> <p>The former prime minister echoed the views of ministers that the recent negative GDP figures may be inaccurate because employment is growing and industrial production is increasing. But George Osborne may have to embark on a harsher than expected strategy in his autumn statement, by accelerating spending cuts or abandoning his debt target, if the Office for Budget Responsibility confirms that a greater proportion of the lost GDP is permanent, or structural.</p> <p>The chancellor is warned in Monday's British Social Attitudes survey that he will have to tread carefully. The survey found that support for higher spending and higher taxes increased from 31% to 36% between 2010 and 2011. Of those questioned, 55% would like spending to remain at the same level.</p> <p>The survey says: \"This is a modest increase, but it could well be the first sign of a reaction against the public spending reductions that the government has begun to implement, and which are set to accumulate between now and 2017.\"</p> <p>The findings show little support for further cuts. But they also show Osborne may have judged the national mood when he warned in the budget that the slower economic growth means an extra \u00a310bn in welfare cuts to avoid much deeper cuts to health and education. The survey found that 59% believe the government should be mainly responsible for ensuring unemployed people have enough to live on against 88% in 2001.</p> <p>The survey found little support (28%) for the view that the \"government should spend more on welfare benefits even if it leads to higher taxes\". This compares with 58% in 1991.</p> <p>There is little support (15%) for an increase in benefits for unemployed people. But there is strong support an increase in benefits for disabled people who cannot work (53%) and overwhelming support (75%) for an increase in benefits for those who care for sick and disabled people.</p> <p>In a chapter on welfare, the survey's co-director Elizabeth Clery writes: \"While attitudes to different aspects of welfare are behaving in a far from uniform way, they are generally moving in line with the current direction of government policy, rather than responding as they have previously to the onset of recession. We see that the public is becoming less supportive of the government taking a leading role in providing welfare to the unemployed, and even to the elderly in retirement. There is less enthusiasm about public spending on all types of benefits and an increasing belief that the welfare system encourages dependence.\"</p> <p>The survey also found a fall in satisfaction with the NHS from an all-time high of 70% in 2010 to 58% in 2011, the first drop in a decade. The NHS budget has been spared most of the cuts because David Cameron has pledged to ensure that it rises at least in line with inflation. But this is tight compared with the last decade when the NHS budget has risen by between 4% to 5% a year in real terms.</p> <p>Of those questioned, 51% would like a large reduction in immigration levels. A further 24% would like to see immigration reduced modestly.</p> <p>The government responded to the findings by insisting that ministers would continue to stabilise the public finances. A Cabinet Office spokesman said: \"There is nothing fair about running huge budget deficits and burdening future generations with our debts. If we don't restore sense to the public finances now, the impact on families and businesses will be worse in the long term, with less money to deliver public services in the future. That has meant tough decisions on spending, but the government has taken action to cut out waste and bring the welfare bill under control so that we can prioritise frontline services, such as the NHS, that people rely on.\"</p>",
  "<p>Suddenly Gillingham may be going places, if anything can be sudden after a century. After two seasons sniffing at the League Two play-offs they have made a flying start with five wins out of six and are the only unbeaten side in the division, which they head by three points. At Priestfield on Saturday they flew out of the blocks \u2013 one up in five minutes, two in 15, three by half-time \u2013 before beating Bristol Rovers 4-0.</p> <p>Martin Allen, manager since July, is not one to hang about. His last job lasted three matches \u2013 mission accomplished. Mostly he rescues clubs, mostly Barnet, where he would gladly have stayed after last season. His average reign over nine years is 10 months. That would be just enough for stage one of Gillingham's new ambition.</p> <p>It is 17 years since Paul Scally became chairman and saved them from liquidation. Their financial path has not been smooth since but they have also gone to the second tier, where they had five seasons and finished 11th in 2003. Having made his money in photocopiers, Scally would settle for more of the same.</p> <p>Maverick as his new manager, he has recently resolved to do away with AGMs. But the club appear to have stability on top of continuity and are enjoying some nice little earners from former players moving on: Matt Jarvis \u00a31.4m from Wolves to West Ham, Ryan Bertrand \u00a3100,000 for every 10 games for Chelsea. And Allen sold Paulo Gazzaniga to Southampton for \u00a3750,000, possibly for sounding like an impostor.</p> <p>Allen replaced Andy Hessenthaler, club legend and now director of football, and Scally said on appointing him: \"Hessy and I wanted somebody who could bring something different to the club.\" Allen has since asked Hessy to be his assistant.</p> <p>He also spun the revolving door, six of one and half a dozen of the other in and out, reuniting with players from Notts County (including his son Charlie), Barnet and Brentford (Deon Burton, last of Gabala in Azerbaijan), all of whom played a part in an emphatic display \u2013 which did not prevent Allen saying: \"We've got to play better, do more, pass quicker against Southend on Tuesday. It can be difficult scoring so early. You can get complacent.\" Conceding early can be difficult, too. Rovers were impotent until Gillingham took their foot off The Gas after the interval.</p> <p>These Gills will have little chance of complacency for long. Allen said he took off Danny Kedwell \"for giving the ball away on halfway\". Kedwell had scored the first two, earning the penalty he converted, then heading home a long throw, his side's fifth in their last seven from that source and his sixth of the season. He and Ben Strevens provided thrust compared with Burton's silky touches. Charlie Lee, at 5ft 9in, headed the third from a corner and later picked out Myles Weston, whose feints and pace caused all sorts of trouble, for Chris Whelpdale to head the fourth.</p> <p>Gillingham's central defenders, Adam Barrett and Callum Davies, attacking the ball early, have yet to be caught out for lack of height while the full-backs and midfield four showed in their interchanging fluidity the benefits of the club's swimming pool, ice baths and fitness coach, James Russell, brought from Notts County but a Gillingham fan from local childhood. Allen was proud that \"not one player's body fat percentage has gone up\" since his arrival; nor has any suffered injury.</p> <p>When it was put to him that it was a coup to get David Wright, who played 20 league games for Crystal Palace last season, to come down on loan, Allen bridled: \"What do you mean 'coming down'?\" Intensity is high, atmosphere charged, commitment reflected in the 40 boxes delivered by furniture removers to Allen's new home there. \"I haven't had time to find the kettle yet,\" he said, betraying the tiger's smile. As long as they are winning, all may be well. \"Some young players took a step forward. It may be useful in March when we're getting promotion,\" he said.</p> <p>Issues remain in the air. Travellers have encroached on the training ground and talks continue on a move to a 20,000-seat complex in Chatham Docks. The crowd was 4,768 on Saturday but topped 11,000 in the Championship. Gillingham, the county's only League club, could just become the Norwich or Ipswich of Kent. Allen, demanding but loyal, said: \"We've not got one bad apple here\" \u2013 what one would expect of the Garden of England.</p>",
  "<p>Last week Arctic sea ice contracted to its smallest extent, before sub-zero temperatures arrived and the ice-sheet began to grow again. According to Norwegian scientists it set a new record, measuring 3 million sq km, 0.6 million sq km less than the previous record (set in 2007).</p> <p>This breakup is exciting for those hoping to sail the Northwest Passage but bad news for others, including polar bears.</p> <p>Closer to home, does Arctic sea ice have any bearing on our weather? Pinning down exact causes for individual weather events is not possible, but a warming Arctic may explain some of our weather trends.</p> <p>The jet stream \u2013 the high level winds that bring much of the UK's weather \u2013 is influenced by the temperature gradient between the equator and north pole. A warmer Arctic reduces the temperature contrast, which weakens the jet stream and makes it more likely to meander.</p> <p>Larger meanders increase the chances of big wet storms being spun up, and spat out north of the meander, as we've seen in the UK this summer. Meanwhile, lying south of a giant meander brings hot dry weather, as much of the US experienced this year.</p> <p>Scientists don't yet know why, but a meandering jet stream appears more likely to get jammed in position, bringing weeks and weeks of the same kind of weather. And whether it is constant sunshine or deluges of rain, being stuck under a jammed jet stream is no fun.</p>",
  "<p>As Curiosity rolls away from its Martian landing site, now named Bradbury Landing, the Red Planet itself hugs Britain's WSW horizon during evening twilight and will stay a challenging object until we lose sight of it in February. Meantime, our nights will be dominated by Jupiter as it reaches mag \u20132.8 at opposition on 3 December when it is visible throughout the night and passes 55\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 high in the S at midnight. Tonight, though, we see it rise in the NE at about 22:00 BST and stand highest in the S just before dawn.</p> <p>Our chart plots the giant planet's progress against the stars of Taurus. At present its eastwards motion is grinding to a halt almost 8\u00b0 NE of the red giant Aldebaran, the celestial bull's bloodshot eye. Between 4 October and 30 January it appears to retrograde westwards as it is overtaken by the faster-moving Earth, being closest to us (609m km) at opposition. It then resumes its usual eastwards trek until we begin to lose it in our NW evening twilight next May.</p> <p>The planet's 143,000 km disc is always an interesting telescopic target. Almost any telescope shows its cloud bands and spots which change in appearance from year to year and also from hour to hour as Jupiter turns on its axis in under 10 hours.</p> <p>The southern of two dark cloud belts that straddle the Jovian equator disappeared in 2010, probably obscured by higher light clouds. It is now back, even darker though not as broad as its northern counterpart. Meanwhile amateur observers spotted a flash near Jupiter's equator on 10 September \u2013 probably the latest in a series of impacts by stray small asteroids or comets. The disc appears 41 arcsec wide at present and swells to 48 arcsec at opposition.</p> <p>Any telescope, and most binoculars, show the four Galilean moons as they change their configuration to E and W of the disc from night to night. Of Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto, all but ice-covered Europa are wider than our own Moon, and all would be visible to the naked eye were they not swamped by Jupiter's glare. These are the target for the European Space Agency's JUICE (Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer) mission recently announced for launch in 2022, with its arrival at Jupiter in 2030. Meanwhile, Nasa's Juno craft is en route for entry into a polar orbit about Jupiter in 2016.</p>",
  "<p>Nasa's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2012/sep/14/astronomy-space\" title=\"\">Curiosity</a>, the rover now on Mars, may find evidence for creatures that lived early in Martian history; firm evidence for even the most primitive bugs would have huge import. There could be life in the ice-covered oceans of Jupiter's moon Europa. But what really fuels popular imagination is the prospect of advanced life \u2013 the \"aliens\" familiar from science fiction \u2013 and nobody expects a complex biosphere in those locations.</p> <p>Suppose, however, we widen our gaze beyond our solar system. Astronomers have learnt that other stars have planets circling round them. Nasa's Kepler spacecraft monitors about 150,000 stars, measuring their brightness sensitively enough to detect the very slight dimming (about one part in 10,000) that occurs when an Earth-like planet transits a sun-like star. The data already reveals thousands of planets. But we'd really like to see these planets directly \u2013 not just their shadows \u2013 and that's hard. To realise just how hard, suppose an alien astronomer with a powerful telescope was viewing Earth from, say, 50 light years away. Our planet would seem, in Carl Sagan's phrase, a \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wupToqz1e2g\" title=\"\">pale blue dot</a>\", very close to a star (our sun) that outshines it many billion times \u2013 a firefly next to a searchlight. But if the hypothetical aliens could detect Earth, they could learn quite a bit about it. The shade of blue would be slightly different depending on whether the Pacific Ocean or the Eurasian land mass was facing them. They could infer the length of the day, the seasons, the gross topography and the climate.</p> <p>In the 2020s, European astronomers hope to complete, in Chile, a telescope with a mosaic mirror 39 metres across. It will be powerful enough to analyse the faint light from planets orbiting other stars with enough precision to infer whether they harbour life.</p> <p>We know too little about how life began on Earth to lay confident odds. It may have involved a fluke so rare that it happened only once in the entire galaxy. On the other hand, it may have been almost inevitable, given the right environment. In the next two decades we can expect progress in understanding the biochemistry of life's origins: this is one of the great unsolved problems \u2013 fascinating to the most Earth-focused biologist, but also crucial in guiding astronomers on how and where to search for alien life.</p> <p>Even if simple life is common, it is, of course, a separate question whether it's likely to evolve into anything intelligent or complex. Indeed, evolutionists don't agree on how divergently our own biosphere could have developed if such contingencies as ice ages and meteorite impacts had happened differently. If, for instance, the dinosaurs hadn't been wiped out, the chain of mammalian evolution that led to humans might have been foreclosed and it's not clear whether another species would have taken our role.</p> <p>Maybe the search for life shouldn't restrict attention to planets like Earth. Science fiction writers have other ideas: balloon-like creatures floating in the dense atmospheres of planets such as Jupiter, swarms of intelligent insects, nano-scale robots and more. (And it's often better to read first-rate science fiction than second-rate science \u2013 it's far more stimulating, and perhaps no more likely to be wrong.) The most durable form of \"life\" may be machines whose creators have long ago been usurped or become extinct.</p> <p>The great physicist <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1938/fermi-bio.html\" title=\"\">Enrico Fermi</a> famously argued that advanced life must be rare. Many stars are a billion years older than our sun. Life, were it common, would have had a head start around these more ancient stars. Why then, Fermi argued, haven't aliens already come here? Why aren't their artefacts staring us in the face? There is substance to this argument. However, we mustn't be too anthropomorphic: some advanced life could be unimaginably different from that on Earth. Others could be living contemplative lives, perhaps deep under some planetary ocean, doing nothing to reveal their presence.</p> <p>We may learn in the coming decades whether biological evolution is unique to the pale blue dot in the cosmos that is our home, or whether Darwin's writ runs through a wider universe that teems with life \u2013 even with intelligence.</p>",
  "<p>Just how receptive are British voters to the policies of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/far-right\" title=\"\">far right</a>? The collapse of the British National party, and the failure of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/english-defence-league\" title=\"\">English Defence League</a> to connect with a wide audience, has led some to conclude that British voters, unlike their European neighbours, are somehow immune to the appeals of far right insurgents. Put simply, the failure of these groups reflects a lack of public demand for exclusionary policies, and an electorate that is largely turned off by the narrative of the far right. This \u2013 some will argue \u2013 is especially true during the financial crisis, when voters have become chiefly concerned over economic rather than social issues, and with the Conservatives in government, who have long been the most trusted party on immigration.</p> <p>In the aftermath of the Olympics, the <a href=\"http://www.extremisproject.org/\" title=\"\">Extremis Project</a> worked with the polling agency YouGov to test this argument, and probe public attitudes toward far-right policies. We surveyed 1,725 British adults, and asked whether certain policies would make them more or less likely to support a political party, or whether these policies would make no difference to their choice at the ballot box. For those who may be interested in the methodology of the research, the figures that I am about to report are weighted and representative of all British adults, while the survey itself was undertaken on 19-20 August.</p> <p>So, what did we find? The first key message is that despite the failure of the BNP and EDL, and the onset of economic crisis, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/16/voters-support-anti-immigrant-party\" title=\"\">large numbers of voters remain open to the core ideas of the far right</a>. Across Europe, the far right has recruited significant support by offering a combination of populist, anti-immigrant and increasingly anti-Muslim policies. Most of these parties promise voters that they will stand up to business and political elites, halt all further immigration, reduce the number of Muslims or the presence of Islam in society, and prioritise native values over other cultures. While the British far right has long lacked the sophistication and resonance of its continental counterparts, our survey suggests that large numbers of voters are receptive to these policies.</p> <p>Consider this: 66% of respondents in our survey would be more likely to support a party that promised to stand up to political and business elites; 55% would be more likely to back a party that pledged to prioritise British values over other cultures; 41% would be more likely to support a party that pledged to halt all immigration into the UK; and a striking 37% \u2013 or almost two-fifths of our sample \u2013 would be more likely to endorse a party that promised to reduce the number of Muslims in British society.</p> <p>At first glance, these results may lead mainstream politicians to the conclusion that they would be well-positioned by appealing to these enduring concerns over immigration and diversity. They might also lead the far right to think that its future looks set to be a prosperous one. But our findings also contain a second key message, which is that there exists a sharp generational divide in our attitudes toward these issues.</p> <p>Whereas older generations \u2013 those who perhaps have less experience with mass immigration, and are less likely to forge relationships with people from different ethnic and cultural backgrounds \u2013 appear relatively clear and resolute in their desire for a party that adopts a tough, populist stance toward elites, immigration, Muslims and British values, younger Britons are significantly less favourable toward this narrative.</p> <p>Whereas over half (54%) of those aged 60 or above would be more likely to shift behind an explicitly anti-immigrant party, less than one quarter (23%) of the 18- to 24-year-olds in our sample would be swayed by this position, while exactly three-fifths of these younger respondents would be \"less likely\" to support this party, or say the policy would make no difference. Similarly, whereas over two-thirds (68%) of those aged 60 or above would be more likely to turn out for a party that promised to prioritise British values over other cultures, less than a third (32%) of the 18- to 24-year-olds adopt the same view. This extends to attitudes toward a party that pledged to reduce the number of Muslims: while almost half (49%) of the over-60s would be more likely to back a movement that pushed this message, the equivalent figure among 18- to 24-year-olds is 27%.</p> <p>These findings are supported by research in sociology, which similarly points to a sharp generational decline in support for crude forms of racial prejudice. This is not to say that challenges do not remain, as large numbers of citizens remain deeply concerned over these issues and appear ready to use their vote accordingly. It is also worth noting that this process of generational change is a long-term game, and one that may not produce positive effects if mainstream politicians fail to protect young people from the effects of austerity Britain, and convince them that immigration and diversity are compatible with their own prosperity. But when seen at a broad level, the challenge is to avoid a short-term and knee-jerk response to the older, angrier and more hostile generations, and think about how best to support the \"rise of the tolerant\", and channel these more accepting generations into the political process.</p> <p>\u2022 Comments on this article will be opened tomorrow (Monday) morning</p>",

  "<p>The man at the centre of Shell's controversial drilling programme in the Arctic has said he is aware of the responsibility on his head but is convinced the Anglo-Dutch oil group is acting in a fully responsible and accountable way.</p> <p>Speaking after a huge ice floe forced drilling 70 miles off the north-west coast of Alaska to be temporarily halted, Peter Slaiby, vice-president of Shell Alaska, insisted that the company had learned from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/bp-oil-spill\" title=\"\">Deepwater Horizon disaster</a>.</p> <p>\"We are raising the bar in the way we have been working with local communities,\" he said. \"We have made 450 different trips to consult and listen to any concerns. We believe the way we are doing this is important \u2013 not just for Alaska but for the wider Arctic region.\"</p> <p>Shell has spent more than $4.5bn (\u00a32.77bn) over four years preparing for work in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chukchi_Sea\" title=\"\">Chukchi</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaufort_Sea\" title=\"\">Beaufort </a>seas, off the state's west and north coasts, but has faced legal action, post-Deepwater Horizon drilling bans and a very short summer weather window.</p> <p>The Chukchi operation finally started eight days ago, on Sunday 10 September, only to be halted almost immediately by the threat of the ice floe, 30 miles long and 12 miles wide, heading towards the drill ship.</p> <p>The disruption triggered a call from Greenpeace for Shell to end its activities completely. It also precedes a report into what Britain should do to safeguard the Arctic, which is scheduled to be released on Thursday by a House of Commons select committee.</p> <p>Environmentalists say a spill similar to Deepwater Horizon would be catastrophic in a pristine environment badly affected by climate change and home to threatened mammals&#xa0;such&#xa0;as polar bears, bowhead whales and walrus.</p> <p>Asked if another major spill would destroy the company's reputation, Slaiby said: \"I feel there is a helluva responsibility on my head, but we have clear accountability models. I have the ability to do things in the right way and I have the backing of the most senior leaders in Shell to do things the right way.\"</p> <p>The company hopes to have Noble Discoverer, its drill ship, back on station any day now to continue its work, despite <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2012/jul/16/greenpeace-activists-shell-petrol-station-video\" title=\"\">demands from Greenpeace and others to call off the operation</a>. Critics have many concerns, from wider fears about new oil production fuelling global warming, to more localised worries that Shell is not as prepared as it claims.</p> <p>Slaiby, said the company fully understands the impact of carbon on climate change but said oil and gas are still needed to meet growing global energy demand in the near term. \"The <a href=\"http://www.usgs.gov/\" title=\"\">US Geological Survey</a> says that about 25% of the world's remaining hydrocarbon reserves are here [the Arctic]. And 25% of those are here in Alaska. Oil and gas are part of the mix, a big part of the energy puzzle, and we have to ensure local communities benefit economically.\"</p> <p>As for safety, Slaiby insisted a \"very, very robust\" oil spill programme had been established to tackle any crisis. He rejected any idea that there could be a repeat of Deepwater, which damaged the beaches of the southern states of the US. \"These wells are very, very different from the Gulf of Mexico wells because they do not have the ability to flow at the rate you have in the Gulf: they are shallower. We are not dealing with deepwater wells. The geology is relatively simple and a third of the pressure [can be expected] in the Chukchi ...

However, a freedom of information request by a federal employees group in Washington has shown that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/09/shell-criticised-limited-testing-alaska-drilling-containment?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">only two brief tests were undertaken on Shell's new containment dome</a> designed to prevent oil spewing into the ocean, and there appeared to be no independent verification.</p> <p>Slaiby, who has worked in the North Sea off Lowestoft in Suffolk, said these revelations gave a misleading picture because Shell had been in meetings over many months with regulators and others about a much wider safety plan. And it had been working for a long time with a third-party contractor and leading drilling safety experts, such as Wild Well Control of Houston.</p> <p>\"We even had the director of BSEE [<a href=\"http://bsee.gov/\" title=\"\">Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement</a>] out with me looking at the capping stack \u2026 I find these charges (of insufficient planning) groundless.\"</p> <p>The preparations made by Shell and others have been under review by the House of Commons environmental audit committee which will release its first report, Protecting the Arctic, on Thursday.</p> <p><strong>Leader comment, page 28 </strong></p>",
  "<p><em>[Updated below]</em></p> <p>Nothing tests one's intellectual honesty and ability to apply principles consistently more than free speech controversies. It is exceedingly easy to invoke free speech values in defense of political views you like. It is exceedingly difficult to invoke them in defense of views you loathe. But the true test for determining the <a href=\"http://www.aclu.org/free-speech/aclu-history-taking-stand-free-speech-skokie\">authenticity of one's belief in free speech</a> is whether <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/15/us/georgia-in-suing-state-aclu-defends-klan.html\">one does the latter</a>, not the former.</p> <p>The anti-US protests sweeping the Muslim world have presented a perfect challenge to test the free speech convictions of both the American right and the Democratic party version of the left. Neither is faring particularly well. </p> <p>Let's begin with the Democrats. On Thursday, the Obama White House <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/politico44/2012/09/white-house-asked-youtube-to-review-antimuslim-film-135586.html\">called executives at Google</a>, the parent company of YouTube, and \"requested\" that the company review whether the disgusting anti-Muslim film that has sparked such unrest should be removed on the ground that it violates YouTube's terms of service. </p> <p>In response, free speech groups such as the ACLU and EFF <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2012/09/activists-troubled-by-white-house-call-to-youtube-135618.html\">expressed serious concerns</a> about the White House's actions. While acknowledging that there was nothing legally compulsory about the White House's request (indeed, Google <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/14/white-house-innocence-of-_n_1885684.html\">announced the next day</a> they would leave the video up), the civil liberties groups nonetheless noted \u2013 correctly \u2013 that \"it does make us nervous when the government throws its weight behind any requests for censorship\", and that \"by calling YouTube from the White House, they were sending a message no matter how much they say we don't want them to take it down; when the White House calls and asks you to review it, it sends a message and has a certain chilling effect\".</p> <p>Right-wing commenters loudly decried the White House's actions on free speech grounds. Some of their rhetoric was overblown (the sentiment behind the request was understandable, and they did nothing to compel its removal). But, for reasons made clear by the ACLU and EFF, these conservative objections were largely correct. </p> <p>In sum, the White House has no business sticking its nose into which videos YouTube decides to publish or suppress. <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/2010/12/big_web.php?ref=fpblg\">Corporations that depend on the US government</a> for all sorts of vital benefits and contracts, and which are subject to its regulations and punishments, will always perceive White House \"requests\" as being far less optional than similar requests from random users. Nobody should want the US government insinuating itself into the determination by private internet companies about which political speech they will allow.</p> <p>The White House's request to YouTube provoked almost no objections from Democrats, who \u2013 when there is a Republican president \u2013 tightly bind themselves to the ACLU and parade around as free speech crusaders. To the extent they acknowledged any of this at all, their responses ranged from indulging patently absurd pretenses (this was just a polite request from the White House: what's wrong with that?) to affirmative justification (the film is intended to cause violence and thus should be removed).</p> <p>Just imagine if the Bush White House had called YouTube and \"requested\" that it remove anti-war videos on the ground that such videos were endangering US troops. That is hardly some fantastical hypothetical. The claim that administration critics were \"emboldening the enemy\" was a <a href=\"http://www.brendan-nyhan.com/blog/gop-dissent-attacks.html\">very common trope</a> during the Bush era (an ugly trope that some progressives <a href=\"http://www.brendan-nyhan.com/blog/attacks-on-dissent-against-president-obama.html\">now repeat</a> toward conservative critics of Obama). John Ashcroft <a href=\"http://articles.cnn.com/2001-12-06/us/inv.ashcroft.hearing_1_military-tribunals-terrorism-probe-attorney-general-john-ashcroft?_s=PM:US\">infamously announced</a> when testifying before the Senate in December 2001 that civil libertarian objections to administration policies \"only aid terrorists\" and \"give ammunition to America's enemies\". </p> <p>Does anyone doubt that if the Bush White House had \"requested\" in the wake of 9/11 that all anti-war or anti-administration videos be \"reviewed\" to see if they should remain on the internet \u2013 on the not-implausible ground that they might encourage attacks on American troops or personnel \u2013 that Democrats would have little trouble seeing why it is dangerous to have the executive branch taking action to influence private internet companies to suppress political speech? The actions of the Obama White House are no less inappropriate. </p> <p>Recall the <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/12/02/lieberman_55/\">so-called \"request\" in December 2010 from Joe Lieberman</a>, made in his capacity as chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, that private corporations such as Amazon, Visa, MasterCard and others cut off all services to WikiLeaks, including hosting its website and allowing payments to the group. Those corporations instantly complied \u2013 how many American companies will continue with behavior which a leading senator announces is harming US national security? \u2013 and <a href=\"http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/12/how_lieberman_got_amazon_to_drop_wikileaks.php\">few Democrats had trouble understanding</a> why such a \"request\" was so odious. It should be equally easy to see why this is the case with the Obama White House's request to Google.</p> <p>Then there's the merits of the censorship case regarding this video. The claim that political speech should be suppressed because it is intended to \"inspire\" or \"provoke\" others to commit violence has been the favorite tactic of censors and free speech enemies for decades. Indeed, every single tyrant who wants to suppress political speech does so by claiming that the ideas being expressed are more than mere \"political opinion\": it is \"incitement\" to violence, they invariably claim.</p> <p>In the 1950s and 1960s, southern states repeatedly attempted to impose criminal and civil liability on the NAACP by claiming, not inaccurately, that the fiery speeches of the group's leaders in defense of boycotts and protests were inspiring some of the group's members to break the law and engage in violence. But the US supreme court, <a href=\"http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/458/886/\">in the 1972 case NAACP v Claiborne</a>, <em>unanimously</em> rejected that pernicious theory, holding that there would be no meaningful free speech if speech could be proscribed on the ground that it \"inspires\" others to commit violence: \"While the State legitimately may impose damages for the consequences of violent conduct, <em>it may not award compensation for the consequences of nonviolent, protected activity</em>\" [my emphasis].</p> <p>The court in Claiborne also noted that even \"advocacy of the use of force or violence does not remove speech from the protection of the first amendment.\" The court there was citing its <a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0395_0444_ZO.html\">earlier decision in Brandenberg v Ohio</a>, which had overturned the criminal conviction of a Ku Klux Klan leader who had threatened violence against political officials in a speech. The Brandenberg court explained that \"the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force.\" Obviously, if the state cannot suppress speech even where it <em>explicitly</em> advocates violence, then it cannot suppress a video on the ground that it <em>implicitly</em> incites violence.</p> <p>In sum, free speech is not intended to protect benign, uncontroversial, or inoffensive ideas. Those ideas do not need protection. It is intended to protect \u2013 to foster \u2013 exactly those political ideas that are most offensive, most provocative, most designed to inspire others to act in the name of its viewpoints. One could say that <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/family-research-council-guard-shot-by-gunman-in-dc/2012/08/15/e420527e-e719-11e1-a3d2-2a05679928ef_story.html\">every significant political idea</a>, on the right and the left, has that provocative potential. If speech can be constrained on the ground that it can inspire or provoke violence by others, then a wide range of political ideas, arguably the only ones that really matter, are easily subject to state suppression. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396228297\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/13/1347530522778/a462deb1-9f4d-4a23-a78d-1d0107dac982-460.jpeg\" alt=\"A Yemeni protester burns a US flag as others storm the US embassy in Sana'a during a protest against a film deemed insulting to the Prophet Mohammed.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Yemeni protester burns a US flag as others storm the US embassy in Sana'a during a protest.

Nobody should want the state to make and enforce lists of prohibited ideas. Even if such state action does not offend you in principle, there's a very pragmatic reason to oppose it: those who cheer when ideas they dislike are suppressed will very likely find, at some point in the future, that their ideas end up on the prohibited list, and will have little ground for objecting when it happens.</p> <p>Then we come to the newfound champions of free speech on the American right. Conservatives do so love to depict themselves as victims: both in general and specifically as free speech martyrs. They particularly love to declare their rights assaulted at the hands of Muslims.</p> <p>Sometimes their complaints are valid. That was true when <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2008/01/13/hate_speech_laws/\">Canada formally investigated a hateful right-wing journalist</a> for his vile speech on the ground that it was \"defamatory\" of Islam, and when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/18/french-journalist-racism-drug-dealer\">France did the same</a>. It was true when Democratic city officials <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/07/26/rahm_emanuels_free_speech_attack/\">threatened or even acted to block</a> zoning permits for a fast food chain on the ground that its owner expresses anti-gay views. It was true when violent protesters tried to suppress Danish cartoons about Muhammad, and it is true now with the violence (that is partially) in response to this video.</p> <p>But the US and its western allies have, in the name of combating terrorism, engaged in free speech assaults aimed primarily at Muslims far more dangerous than any of those examples. And with very few exceptions, these same right-wing free speech champions have remained utterly silent, except when cheering it all on.</p> <p>Last September, the <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/09/04/speech_23//\">justice department arrested and indicted</a> Jubair Ahmad, a 24-year-old Pakistani legal resident living in Virginia and charged with \"providing material support\" to a designated terrorist organization (Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT)). His alleged crime? As <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/09/04/speech_23//\">I wrote</a> when the indictment was announced:</p> <blockquote> <p>He produced and uploaded a 5-minute video to YouTube featuring photographs of U.S. abuses in Abu Ghraib, video of armored trucks exploding after being hit by IEDs, prayer messages about 'jihad' from LeT's leader, and \u2013 according to the <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/63816237/Jubair-Ahmad-Affidavit\">FBI's Affidavit</a> \u2013 'a number of terrorist logos.' That, in turn, led the FBI agent who signed the affidavit to assert that 'based on [his] training and experience, it is evident that the video \u2026 is designed as propaganda to develop support for LeT and to recruit jihadists to LeT.' The FBI also claims Ahmad spoke with the son of an LeT leader about the contents of the video and had attended an LeT camp when he was a teenager in Pakistan. For the act of uploading that single YouTube video (and for denying that he did so when asked by the FBI agents who came to his home to interrogate him), he faces 23 years in prison.</p> </blockquote> <p>Last July, former Obama justice department official Marty Lederman <a href=\"http://balkin.blogspot.com.br/2011/07/begolly-indictment-and-first-amendment.html\">highlighted</a> the arrest of a 22-year-old former Penn State student for - in <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2011/July/11-nsd-919.html\">the FBI's words</a> - \"repeatedly using the Internet to promote violent jihad against Americans\" by posting comments on a \"jihadist\" Internet forum including \"a comment online that praised the [October, 2010] shootings\" at the Pentagon and Marine Corps Museum and \"a number of postings encouraging attacks within the United States\". He also posted links to a bomb-making manual. </p> <p>Regarding the part of the indictment based on \"encouraging violent attacks\", Lederman argued that it \"does not at first glance appear to be different from the sort of advocacy of unlawful conduct that is entitled to substantial first amendment protection under the Brandenburg line of cases.\" </p> <p>As for linking to bomb-making materials, Lederman wrote: \"the first amendment generally protects the publication of publicly available information, even where there is a chance or a likelihood that one or more readers may put such information to dangerous, unlawful use.\" As a result, Lederman concluded, the indictment \"would appear to be very vulnerable to a first amendment challenge\". </p> <p>Such blatant assaults on the free speech rights of Muslims in the US, and in the west generally, are common. In 2009, a Pakistani man in New York was <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2009/04/2009423233919457969.html\">sentenced to almost six years in federal prison</a> for the \"crime\" of including a Hezbollah news channel in the cable package he offered for sale to television viewers in Brooklyn. Just this month, a British Muslim teenager, Azhar Ahmed, was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-19604735\">convicted of the \"crime\"</a> of posting a Facebook message which said: \"all soldiers should die and go to hell.\" There is even <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/06/01/free_speech_4/\">ample evidence</a> that the US government targeted its own citizen, Anwar al-Awlaki, for assassination without due process <em>not</em> based on unproven claims that he was engaged in plotting terror attacks (a claim the government made only long after it was disclosed that they were trying to kill him), but rather due to its dislike of his political and religious sermons against the US which became quite popular among Muslim youth on YouTube.</p> <p>The rationale for all of this speech-based punishment aimed at Muslims is exactly the same as the one used to advocate the suppression of the anti-Islam video and other anti-Muslim speech: it goes beyond mere \"speech\" and is intended to incite or justify violence. Those who accept that precept to ignore or even cheer for the suppression or punishment of views they dislike, while loudly decrying it when it comes to the views they share, are not believers in free speech. </p> <p>They are just rank manipulators who exploit free speech values in an attempt to ensure that only their views can be heard while the views they despise are suppressed. This, unfortunately, is the <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2009/05/06/free_speech_2/\">clear history of the American right</a>, now marching so flamboyantly behind the free speech banner in order to protect hateful anti-Islam speech.</p> <p>It would be genuinely nice to believe that these newfound conservative free speech champions would henceforth become consistent allies in the fight against state suppression of political opinions: not just when their own ideas are attacked, but also when those views they hate are, including those of Muslim critics of US foreign policy. Until that happens, the complete insincerity of their free speech cheerleading is manifest.</p> <h2>Other matters</h2> <p>It is just extraordinary, as I <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/14/egypt-nbc\">noted on Friday</a>, that even after multiple wars and killings and invasions and occupations, the US, in the face of these anti-American protests in the Muslim world, is still stuck, oh-so-earnestly, on that eternal question: <em>why do they hate us?</em> That continues even as <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2012/09/16/afghanistan-nato-airstrike.html\">things like this</a> happen continuously.</p> <p>Along those lines, the New York Times yesterday <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/15/world/middleeast/anti-american-protests-over-film-enter-4th-day.html\">expressed bafflement</a> that Afghans would burn an effigy of President Obama given that he \"had made an outreach to Muslims a thematic pillar of his first year in office.\" As FAIR's Jim Naureckas <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JNaureckas/status/247290827041292288\">responded</a>: \"Maybe WAR made a bigger impression?\"</p> <p>On a different note: over the next six weeks, I will be speaking in numerous American cities (and one event in Canada) on civil liberties, Islamophobia, the war on terror, the surveillance state, and related matters. Those events will be in California, Colorado, Missouri, Arizona, Michigan, Washington, Texas, and New Jersey, as well as in Ottawa, Canada. All events are open to the public, and <a href=\"http://ggsidedocs.blogspot.com.br/2012/09/late-septemberoctober-speaking-events.html\">event information is here</a>.</p> <h2>UPDATE</h2> <p>Numerous people have popped up in the comment section in order, quite unsurprisingly, to create all sorts of exceptions to \"free speech\" designed to protect their own views while allowing the criminalization of views they dislike. The hallmark of someone who does not really believe in free speech is when they claim they do, followed by a \"but\", followed by efforts to explain why the views they embrace should be permitted, while the views they despise should not be.</p> <p>The most common claim in this regard is that speech that advocates violence is not permissible. Leave aside the fact that most of the examples I cited above where the speech of Muslims was criminalized involved no such advocacy. Leave aside the fact that the US supreme court, more than 40 years ago and by a unanimous vote, ruled that \"the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force.\"</p> <p>Further leave aside that this free speech \"exception\" would render illegal all sorts of views which are plainly legitimate. Do people who believe this really think that it should be illegal for a Muslim to say: \"The west is continuously bringing violence to our societies by attacking us with bombs, invasions and occupations, and I believe the only way deter this is to take up arms and impose violence back on them\"? Should it be similarly illegal for someone to say, as the American founders did: \"I believe our government has become so tyrannical and unjust that it is now justified to take up arms against it in revolution\"? </p> <p>And finally leave aside the fact that all sorts of common political advocacy can be construed as \"advocating violence\". As noted, it is often claimed that those who denounce US wars as unjust aggression or imperialism are \"emboldening\" attacks on US troops and therefore inciting violence.</p> <p>My real question for those who insist that advocacy of violence should be suppressed is this: do you apply this view consistently? Do you want those who advocated the attack on Iraq - i.e., who advocated violence - to be arrested? How about those who cheer for the war in Afghanistan, or drone attacks on Pakistanis and Yemenis? The next time someone in the US or UK stands up and advocates a new war - say, attacking Iran - should they be arrested on the ground that they are advocating violence?</p> <p>Or is it the case, as it certainly appears, that when people say that \"advocating violence\" should be suppressed, what they really mean is: <em>it should be prohibited for those people over there to advocate violence against my society, but my society is of course free to advocate violence against them? </em> </p> <p>As I wrote above, those who apply free speech values inconsistently are not merely being hypocritical; worse, they are attempting to exploit free speech precepts to protect and legitimize the views of themselves and their own side while suppressing those views they dislike and which are advocated by the other side. Indeed, it's often the very people who insist that \"advocacy of violence\" should not be permitted who, in the next breath, justify the wars and bombings and drone-attacks of their government.</p>",
