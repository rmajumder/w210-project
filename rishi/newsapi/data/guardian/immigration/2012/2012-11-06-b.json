  "<p>Like Mahmoud Abbas, my father came from Safed, and on behalf of his family I have no intention of renouncing claims arising from our expulsion from the town in 1947-48 (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/04/mahmoud-abbas-palestinian-territories?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Abbas sparks Palestinian fury after waiving right of return</a>, 5 November). In describing massacres in the Safed area, the Israeli Meron Benvenisti wrote: \"These atrocities which \u2026 are regarded as libel, invented by the enemies of Israel \u2026 were, at the time they took place, known to ministers in the Israeli government, military commanders, and even the general public.\"</p> <p>The rights of the expelled Palestinians have not evaporated with the passage of time. The houses they lived in and the valuables they left behind were all stolen by the Jews who moved in. When I tried to visit one of my family's houses in Safed a few years ago \u2013 a house mentioned in Mahmoud Abbas's memoirs \u2013 the door was slammed in my face by the Russian-Jewish owner. The issue that has to be addressed is how the undeniable right of return of Palestinian refugees is to be managed. Having visited Safed many times, I am in two minds about whether I would actually return there. From having been a vibrant town with a majority Arab population, but a significant centuries-old Jewish presence, it has now become a dump. The former Arab part of town has been turned into a so-called \"Artists Quarter\", where there is little sign of art, just tawdry paintings and cheap knick-knacks that no one buys. But it is for me to decide whether I want to return or accept compensation, not for the Israelis, or indeed the president of Palestine, to deny that right on my behalf.<br><strong>Karl Sabbagh</strong><br><em>Newbold on Stour, Warwickshire </em></p> <p>\u2022 The letter from Ghada Karmi and others (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/01/uk-responsibility-to-the-palestinians?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">UK's responsibility to the Palestinians</a>, 2 November) deserves correction. Only a fully truthful account can render justice to the Palestinians. The Balfour declaration made explicit that its implementation should not prejudice the rights of the indigenous inhabitants. In no way did it give the Zionist movement \"carte blanche to transform the overwhelmingly Arab state of Palestine into a Jewish one\". Leaving aside the question of whether Palestine was a state in any modern meaning of the word after the removal of the Ottoman empire, how the terms of the Balfour declaration were observed was a matter for the British government exercising its responsibilities under the mandate. I doubt very much that Britain \"encouraged the mass immigration into Palestine of hundreds of thousands of European Jews\". Rather the reverse.</p> <p>Until the 1930s, Jewish immigration, motivated more by religious belief than Zionist nationalism, was at a fairly low level and often tolerated by the Palestinian population. It was in the 1930s that this all changed. The pressure of European antisemitism motivated Jews to seek refuge outside Europe and the only place open to most of them (and which their faith told them was the land promised to them as their ultimate destiny) was Palestine. The doors of other nations, Britain and the US in particular, were shut to them. But it was the culmination of European antisemitism in the Holocaust which led to an international crisis. In postwar Europe there were several million displaced survivors unable to return to their original countries. Had Britain admitted up to 1&#xa0;million of the displaced Jews, and the US up to 2 million, the crisis in Palestine would have been solvable. Instead Britain invited in thousands of Ukrainians, among them SS war criminals. Thus to the tragedy of the Shoah was added the tragedy of the Nakba.<br><strong>Lionel Burman</strong><br><em>West Kirby, Wirral </em></p> <p>\u2022 Re the Arab exodus from Palestine: there is no mention of the UN resolution which divided Palestine between Arab and Jew, which Israel accepted and the Arabs did not. Nor is there any reference to the war which followed, when six Arab nations invaded the new Israeli state with the declared aim of its elimination. Without that rejection and invasion of Israel there would have been no Arab refugees.<br><strong>Paul Miller</strong><br><em>London </em></p>",
  "<p>The 2012 campaign began before the campaign of 2008 had finished. In February of that year, while Barack Obama was still locked in an epic struggle for the Democratic nomination against Hillary Clinton, Mitt Romney summoned his closest allies to a Boston office to work out why his effort to be the Republicans' standard-bearer of 2008 had failed so badly. He handed out a memo he had written about himself, detailing his strengths and weaknesses, assessing his own defeated candidacy as if it were one of the businesses he once assessed as a hotshot management consultant. This was no mere exercise in navel-gazing. Romney was determined to learn the lessons of defeat in 2008 in order to win in 2012.</p> <p>Thus began a long march that ended today. The visible miles came last winter, when Romney trudged through the pig farms of Iowa and the snows of New Hampshire in his search for the Republican nomination. But that followed an invisible primary, an endless round of closed-door fundraisers to fill up a war-chest he hoped would scare off the most fearsome potential rivals.</p> <p>Whether money was the explanation or not, Romney was indeed rewarded by the decision of several big-beast Republicans not to challenge him for the nomination. The New Jersey governor Chris Christie, Indiana's Mitch Daniels and others, including Sarah Palin, skipped the race, leaving the path open for Romney.</p> <p>When ambitious politicians duck a presidential contest, that's usually because they suspect the incumbent will be too hard to dislodge. In the summer of 2011, that looked like the smart decision. For Obama had just done what George W Bush had failed to do: he had removed \u2013 killed \u2013 Osama bin Laden. Many Republicans concluded that, given the US economy was bound to at least slightly improve by November 2012, the scalp of Bin Laden made the president tough to beat.</p> <p>The course for Romney ran anything but smooth. Instead of warming to the former Massachusetts governor as the obvious choice \u2013 a successful businessman who looked like Hollywood's idea of a president \u2013 Republican primary voters seemed ready to fall in love with almost anyone but him. The field of rivals included outlandish characters who seemed absurd to outsiders: pizza magnate Herman Cain, evolution-denying congresswoman Michelle Bachmann, Texas governor Rick Perry, who could not remember which three government departments he planned to shut down. Former McCain campaign manager Steve Schmidt said: \"The Republican primary resembled a reality-TV show. All these guys might as well have been living in a tree house with Simon Cowell.\"</p> <p>And yet each of those candidates enjoyed a moment in the sun, a surge in support that made them \u2013 rather than Romney \u2013 the frontrunner. It was as if Republicans were desperate to find someone else to nominate. Accordingly, former senator Rick Santorum and the former House speaker Newt Gingrich won enough states between them to ensure the primary race dragged on.</p> <p>That long, bruising primary battle cost Romney dear, and not just financially (it forced him to spend money defeating his fellow Republicans rather than saving it for the fight against Obama). The greater cost was political.</p> <p>It exposed the future Republican nominee to sustained attack from his own side. The notion of Romney as a ruthless plutocrat, coldly laying off American workers, did not come from the Democrat attack machine. Romney was not seen as embodying the 1% because of the Occupy movement. Rather, that portrait was drawn by Gingrich, who aired an extended commercial, \"When Mitt Romney came to Town\", that tore apart Romney's tenure at the helm of the private equity firm Bain &amp; Co. It depicted him as a corporate raider, willing to shutter factories and shatter working lives if it made him richer. That critique lingered all year, eagerly picked up and advanced by the Democrats. But it originated with the Republicans.</p> <p>Still, the damage of the primaries went deeper. To push aside Santorum, Bachmann and the others, Romney was obliged to adopt positions that would endear him to the Republican faithful \u2013 but which stored up trouble for later. So Romney reversed his previous support for abortion rights and gun control, called on undocumented migrants to \"self-deport\" and rebranded himself from a Massachusetts moderate, who as governor had passed healthcare reform, into the \"severe conservative\" who now promised to repeal \"Obamacare\".</p> <p>Those reverses left him doubly wounded. For one thing, he could now be slammed as a serial flip-flopper, just another politician who believed in nothing and would say whatever it took to be elected. For another, he had been boxed into a series of positions bound to alienate core blocs of the electorate that had long been tough for Republicans to reach \u2013 the young, Latinos and suburban women among them.</p> <p>Sure enough, through the summer months he was on the receiving end of an air assault from Obama, in the form of saturation TV ads in key states, which portrayed Romney as part boardroom vulture, part unprincipled phoney. Obama, who had faced no primary challenge of his own, had the money to do it \u2013 defining Romney before he had a chance to define himself.</p> <p>Yet Romney could not just blame Obama. Much of his trouble was of his own making. He helped colour in the cartoon of himself as an out-of-touch one percenter when he boasted that his wife had \"a couple of Cadillacs\" or when his tax returns \u2013 showing that he paid a meagre 14% \u2013 had to be dragged out of him. In July, he botched an overseas tour meant to boost his credentials as a potential world leader by offending America's most easily pleased ally, Britain, when he suggested the London Olympics could be a flop and by travelling to Jerusalem to offer his view that cultural inferiority might be the cause of Palestinian suffering.</p> <p>What should have been a moment to relaunch his candidacy and make Americans look at him anew \u2013 his party convention in Tampa in August \u2013 also had little effect. His speech was overshadowed by a moment of Dadaist theatre, as Clint Eastwood harangued an empty chair standing in for an imaginary Obama. Romney was on his way to becoming a joke figure.</p> <p>In September, he went from being ridiculed to being hated. A leaked video showed him addressing fellow millionaires at a fundraising event in May, where an unplugged Romney candidly wrote off 47% of the electorate as parasites, non-taxpaying dependents who would never vote Republican because they would not \"take responsibility for their own lives\". Even many on his own side believed it was an act of self-destruction so complete that no candidate could possibly survive it.</p> <p>But Romney had one more chance. The first TV debate in Denver on 3 October was, for many Americans, the first time they had paid close attention to the election. What they saw was an incumbent president who looked exhausted, listless and disengaged. With his head down, his answers sluggish, it seemed he either was too tired to be president or no longer really wanted the job.</p> <p>Romney, by contrast, was spirited and energetic. Above all, he came across as a human being rather than the caricature of Obama propaganda: all he had to do was not seem like a rapacious capitalist bloodsucker and, in an instant, he had broken the core message of the Obama campaign. The immediate bounce that Romney enjoyed in the polls suggested that a small chunk of the electorate, disenchanted with the president, had been waiting to see if the Republican was a plausible replacement. In Denver Romney crossed that threshold.</p> <p>That change revealed what had always been the structural reality of this race. By rights, it should always have been close. Here was an incumbent president who had struggled to lift his approval rating above 50%, who had seen the number of Americans saying the US was on the \"wrong track\" become a majority and, most crucially, had watched as the unemployment rate had remained stuck at 8% for almost his entire presidency, shifting below that figure only a matter of weeks ago. The last president to be re-elected with a jobless percentage that high was Franklin Roosevelt in 1940, in what were rather different circumstances.</p> <p>So the election should never have been a cakewalk for Obama. That it had seemed that way, until Denver, attested to the deeply flawed candidacy of Romney. By raising his game at that first debate, he restored politics to something like normal service.</p> <p>Obama conceded that he had messed up, joked that he had been napping in the first encounter and sharpened up for the next two, where he remained clear, focused and unafraid to confront his opponent: in Denver he had failed even to mention Romney's 47% remark. Now he made it his closing argument.</p> <p>But October was a tough month for the president. He was hobbled by accusations that he had bungled or even deceived the public over the September killing of four US diplomats in Benghazi, an issue unlikely to go away. Still the end of the month brought some unlikely and helpful allies.</p> <p>The first was a former nemesis, Bill Clinton, who in 2008 had dismissed Obama's presidential bid as a \"fairytale\". In the campaign's closing days, Obama let the man they call the big dog run \u2013 as the country's most beloved Democrat grew hoarse making the case for his successor. Obama didn't just exploit Clinton's ability to connect to the white, male blue-collar Americans who remain beyond the current president's reach \u2013 he all but ran on Clinton's record, arguing that \"We know my plan works because we've tried it,\" referring to Clinton's success in the 1990s.</p> <p>The second ally was a genuine surprise. Some pollsters doubt that Superstorm Sandy really made a big difference for Obama, noting that Romney's surge, \"Mittmentum\", had already stalled before the weather changed. But few deny that Obama benefited from the chance to be seen doing the job of president, while Romney was sidelined, and profited especially from the bearhug he received from the Republicans' rising star, Chris Christie. His gushing praise for Obama, and refusal to campaign at Romney's side in Pennsylvania, was precious validation for the president \u2013 and it came at just the right time.</p> <p>And so the two men duelled to the very last, Romney making two campaign convention-breaking stops on election day itself. The campaign had finished, but the politics is anything but over.</p>",
  "<p>When he is voted in unopposed as the chairman of the British Olympic Association on Wednesday, Lord Coe will be at once joining an organisation on the crest of a wave and in some difficulty. On the one hand, it has just played a major part in delivering the best British performance at an Olympic Games in over a century, under the unremitting glare of a home Games. On the other, it faces long-running questions over its finances and remit amid a looming debate over the post-Games sporting landscape. But the appointment of Coe, London 2012's figurehead with a large reservoir of political, public and international goodwill to draw on, will give it the best opportunity possible to face those challenges \u2013 assuming he can devote enough time to them amid his portfolio existence. Among the challenges in his in-tray are:</p> <h2><strong>Finances</strong></h2> <p>Before taking the job, Coe sought assurances that the BOA's creaky finances would not damage his ability to do it. Dismal sales of BOA scarves and medallions during the Games, not to mention a long-running row with Coe's Locog over the deal that originally licensed the Olympic rings to the 2012 organisers, left the BOA's balance sheet in a parlous state. Its 2011 accounts revealed a \u00a3411,000 loss but the more serious impact will be felt this year when the full cost of delivering the 550-strong British team to the Games are taken into account. In its recent accounts, it revealed that it had extended its overdraft to \u00a35m for the first quarter of next year. There is also an ongoing debate about whether it should lobby for a share of public money for some areas of its operation \u2013 such as the museum it wants to build on the Olympic Park and the Get Set educational programme it has inherited from Locog \u2013 or remain entirely independent of government.</p> <h2><strong>Legacy</strong></h2> <p>Coe was once fond of saying it was for others to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/blog/2012/oct/18/olympic-legacy-london-2012-lord-coe?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">deliver on the legacy created by the Games</a>. But his decision to accept an offer from the prime minister David Cameron to be a government adviser and cheerleader for the Olympic legacy and an entreaty from the sports minister, Hugh Robertson, to take on the BOA role have left him among those who will be judged on whether the promises he made to secure the Olympics are being kept. The success of the Games has not only given the BOA a platform to exploit but also left Britain's standing at an all-time high among the global sporting community. A bid for the 2018 Youth Olympic Games has already been submitted on behalf of Glasgow, but it will be for Coe to decide how else best to capitalise.</p> <h2><strong>Role</strong></h2> <p>A long overdue debate on the respective roles and responsibilities of the alphabet soup of British sports administration bodies had been put off until after the Games. A full-blown merger of UK Sport, the Olympic funding agency with which the BOA under outgoing chairman Lord Moynihan regularly clashed, and grassroots body Sport England is likely to be put on ice in favour of streamlining their operations and moving to new offices. Before the Games, Moynihan had spoken ambitiously about the BOA taking a lead role in coaching, school sport and a host of other areas that could lead to clashes and overlap. Coe's task will be to define what sort of organisation he wants the BOA to be and where it should sit in the overall sporting landscape. Given his success at bringing together previously warring factions to deliver the Games, Coe will be expected to build a consensus \u2013 nationally and internationally. His task is likely to be helped if long-time friend and ally Sir Keith Mills takes on a role as chairman of both UK Sport and Sport England, as some in government want.</p> <h2><strong>Staff</strong></h2> <p> Ahead of the arrival of the new chairman, the BOA chief executive, Andy Hunt, presented a restructuring plan to the board designed to streamline the number of senior staff and save money \u2013 and potentially cement his own position in the process. The departure of Sir Clive Woodward, although by his own volition, will also help save money. Under the plan, the number of divisional directors will be reduced from 11 to seven and the overall headcount from 87 to 52, including an unspecified number of redundancies. Coe will have to pilot the organisation through this morale-sapping period and emerge the other side with a clearer idea of its future role.</p> <h2><strong>Commercial</strong></h2> <p>The rationale behind the investment by Moynihan and Hunt \u2013 who expanded the commercial team ahead of the Games \u2013 was the lure of the rewards on offer once the rights to the Olympic rings return to the organisation at the beginning of next year. But aside from a new contract with Adidas and a marketing deal with the International Olympic Committee's commercial partners, which will bring in \u00a313m over the next four years, there has been little progress in getting other deals over the line. The hope is that Coe's longstanding links at the highest levels with some of the biggest multinationals, and Locog's success in delivering more than \u00a3700m of sponsorship incomedespite the global recession, will help seal more of those deals.</p>",

  "<p>An increasing middle-class \"brain drain\" of British professionals moving abroad to live and work is raising concerns about future skills shortages in the UK, <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/science-research-statistics/research-statistics/immigration-asylum-research/horr68/\" title=\"\">Home Office research</a> has found.</p> <p>The study of emigration from Britain reveals that an estimated 4.7 million UK-born people now live abroad, with Australia consistently the most popular destination over the past 20 years.</p> <p>The research also discloses that, contrary to popular wisdom, fewer people emigrate from Britain at times of rising unemployment as they find it harder to sell-up and fund their move abroad. This is in sharp contrast to the era of the \"\u00a310 Pom\" 50 years ago when 80,000 impoverished British migrants a year used to sign up for an assisted passage to Australia.</p> <p>The study found that those moving abroad are overwhelmingly (93%) of working age and that the popular image of Brits retiring to the Spanish Costas is in decline. Only 4,000 people of retirement age moved abroad in 2010, down from a peak of 22,000 in 2006. The fall reflects the end of the house price bubble in Britain during which homeowners could sell up and live more cheaply abroad, while enjoying the better climate and quality of life. The largest numbers of British pensioners living abroad are not in Spain at all but are to be found in Australia, Canada and the US, reflecting the large British communities who settled in those countries years ago.</p> <p>The Office of National Statistics says emigration from Britain rose sharply over the past decade from 363,000 a year to a peak of 427,000 in 2008. Since then it has fallen back to 350,000 a year. Long-term migrants are defined as those who move abroad for at least 12 months.</p> <p>British emigrants account for 149,000 or 43% of the 350,000 who left Britain to live abroad during 2011. The remaining 57% were made up of almost equal numbers of European Union and non-EU citizens returning home after living and working in Britain.</p> <p>It also found that citizens of other EU countries, who face shorter travel distances and lower costs, are far more likely to return home after living in Britain than those from the rest of the world. Migrants from the Indian sub-continent and the Caribbean Commonwealth countries are also more likely to settle in Britain than those who come to live in Britain from Australia, New Zealand or America.</p> <p>The Home Office study says a large and increasing proportion of British citizens moving abroad are those from the professional or managerial occupations and this has implications for the future availability of skills in Britain.</p> <p>This group made up just over a third or 37% of British emigrants in 1991 but reached nearly half or 48% in 2010 after a steady year-on-year rise until the global recession of 2008. Most moved abroad to a definite job rather than simply speculative looking for work.</p> <p>The most recent estimate by the World Bank shows that in 2011 there were 4.7 million British citizens living abroad, representing 7% of the total UK population and the eighth highest of any country in terms of absolute numbers. In percentage terms, countries such as Portugal (21%) and Ireland (16%) have much higher proportions of their population living abroad.</p> <p>The largest British communities around the world are in Australia (1.2 million), the US (701,000), Canada (675,000) and Spain (411,000).</p> <p>The Home Office study found that most emigrants intend to live abroad for more than four years and most go to work in a definite job.

  "<p>Ryanair customers who went to the trouble of using the airline's own credit card to avoid paying a \u00a36 admin fee will no longer have that benefit after the firm announced that all passengers will have to pay the charge. Anyone taking a Ryanair flight after 1 December will be required to pay the \u00a36 a person fee for each single journey as part of the headline ticket price, irrespective of how they pay.</p> <p>Until now, customers who took out a Ryanair Cash Passport Mastercard could avoid the credit card fee, which adds \u00a348 to the cost of booking a return journey for a family of four.</p> <p>The move is the latest in a long battle between Ryanair and the Office of Fair Trading over hidden card charges. Until November 2011, it was possible to avoid the airline's credit card fee using any prepaid Mastercard. Before that, consumers got around it by using a Visa Electron card, but that was also shelved when it became too popular. Since then the airline's own credit card, already criticised for its other charges, has been the only payment method allowing consumers to escape the booking charge. Ryanair blamed the OFT for its rule change. An <a href=\"http://www.oft.gov.uk/news-and-updates/press/2012/58-12\" title=\"\">OFT investigation in July</a> led to 12 airlines \u2013 including Ryanair and easyJet \u2013 agreeing not to hide charges until the end of the booking process, and instead include all compulsory fees in the headline price.</p> <p>In a statement, Stephen McNamara of Ryanair said: \"Ryanair regrets the recent anti-consumer ruling of the OFT, which will result in thousands of UK Ryanair Cash Passport holders no longer having a free form of payment that allows them to avoid the \u00a36 admin fee when booking flights on Ryanair.com. This is another example of regulatory interference by the OFT which once again increases the cost of travel for passengers.\"</p> <p>He said it was perverse that the OFT continued to impose regulations that increased the cost of air travel, but had done nothing to halt mis-selling by screen scraper websites, which duped passengers into paying hidden booking costs.</p> <p>Ryanair's charge is similar to the \u00a39 per booking charge (more if paying on credit card) now levied by rival easyJet for all customers. Ryanair insists it will now include the admin fee in the upfront price.</p> <p>Separately it has emerged that Ryanair has looked at the possibility of charging passengers for carry-on baggage as part of its plan to increase revenue and profits.</p> <p>Deputy chief executive, Michael Cawley, told the <a href=\"http://www.independent.ie/national-news/ryanair-now-considers-carryon-bag-charge-3285213.html\" title=\"\">Irish Independent</a> that baggage charges are among those that are always under consideration. Asked if Ryanair might also consider charging for carry-on baggage, he said: \"If you don't charge for something, that service isn't appreciated,. When it was free, 80% of people checked in a bag.\" Now just 35% of Ryanair passengers checked in a bag.</p> <p>\"We'd consider anything, but we're not doing it at the moment,\" he added.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 7 November 2012 to say that the \u00a36 booking charge will be stated in the headline price. The original article said it was an additional fee.</p>",
  "<h2>This week's comedy news</h2> <p>On the day of the US presidential election, Laughing stock can exclusively reveal that Barack Obama has decisively won. At least in some senses.

The disparity was greatest on The Late Show with David Letterman, where the ratio was 44 Romney gags to only 9 about Obama.

Imagine what Jon Stewart could have done about the issue of Scottish independence or Saturday Night Live could have done about the \"cash for access\" scandal or what Trey Parker and Matt Stone could have done with the Jimmy Savile story.\" </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/19193358\" title=\"\">JeremyinOz heartily agrees:</a></p> <blockquote> \"When people compare British comedy favourably with American comedy (something that is getting harder and harder to do) they forget about the cartoon: South Park; the Family Guy stable and Matt Groening's work, which are consistently better and more biting than anything on British TV. When British writers try to be as pointed as South Park, say, they tend to come across as whiny or bitter or think that shouting Tory loudly is funny.\" </blockquote> <p>Speaking of whiny, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/oct/30/sarah-millican\" title=\"\">Sarah Millican's responses to the laser-like questioning of Guardian interviewer Simon Hattenstone</a> drew some criticism \u2013 and defence \u2013 from our readers. Then came <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/19194068\" title=\"\">jingjangjong, placing Millican firmly in the context of a grim view of UK comedy</a>.</p> <blockquote> \"She is no better or no worse than a raft of about 20 or so well-remunerated comics who seem to slip effortlessly from primetime BBC One to stadium tour to mega-selling DVD. They are all beige, boring and safe. It is like the past 30 years of alternative comedy never happened. <br> \"Actually things are probably worse now [than at the time of] the supposed wasteland of pre-alternative comedy in the 70s. At least Bernard Manning and his ilk doing jokes about \"them Pakis up our street\" was balanced out by Les Dawson and Dave Allen (on primetime ITV, no less!) doing stuff that made you wonder at the beauty of the English language or think about important stuff like politics and religion. What do we have now in the way of standup on TV that makes you think? Stewart Lee buried on late-night BBC2 \u2026\" </blockquote> <p>Is anyone prepared to leap to the defence of UK comedy?</p>",
  "<p>Today, as you may have heard, is Election Day in the US. Here are a few notes about that:</p> <p><strong>(1)</strong> Ponder how great it would be if one could vote for the imaginary/fantasy Obama which, alas, sadly exists only in the paranoid imagination of those who populate the fever-swamps of the right-wing: the Kenyan anti-colonialist on the angry warpath against American militarism and oligarchy, engineering Apology Tours for America's past sins and vengeance-based retribution for thieving Wall Street tycoons. <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/332579/crush-them-michael-walsh\">Here</a>, for instance, is the person who National Review's Michael Walsh genuinely seems to think is president:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"In retrospect, of course, William Jefferson Blythe III was Pericles of Athens compared to Barack Obama, who far more than Clinton has revealed the true face of contemporary American left-liberalism in all its coercive ugliness: a blizzard of executive orders; the deployment of the regulatory agencies that have (in the words of the Declaration of Independence) 'sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance'; and the naked Marxist appeals to race and class envy. The most anti-American of American presidents has run the most un-American of campaigns.</p> <p>\"And that, by rights, should be it. That it's not explains the alarm of conservatives whose view of patriotism is that they love their country as it is, not as they wish it might someday be. From Day One of the Obama administration, real conservatives understood the explicit threat of 'fundamental change', whose meaning can now be clearly discerned in Obama's \"revenge' remark; for the Left, 'revenge' is precisely what this election is all about. For them and their voting-bloc constituents, it's payback time: payback for slavery and segregation; payback for poverty; payback for foreign wars; payback for restrictive immigration laws. </p> <p>\"They've long used the goals of the civil-rights movement \u2014 which after all was directed precisely agains't Democrats \u2013 and the Vietnam-era 'anti-war' movement \u2014 which arose in opposition to the foreign policy of the Democrats \u2014 as wedges with which to crack the larger social structure and now, so close to realizing the ultimate expression of 'critical theory' \u2014 that everything about America stinks \u2014 they and their media allies are doing their best to swing one last election for Obama.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Why didn't someone tell me that Obama was seeking \"fundamental change\", applies \"critical theory\" to conclude that American does much evil in the world, and is all about getting \"payback for poverty [and] payback for foreign wars\"? If you see that person on the ballot, please let me know. I'd like to go canvass for him. Or, as Brad Reed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bwreed/status/265829480579358720\">put it</a>: \"Kenyan anti-colonial socialism looks a lot like American imperial neoliberalism these days . . . .\"</p> <p><strong>(2)</strong> I rarely do election prognosticating, but the Atlantic's Conor Friedersdorf today remembered that, six months ago, I did, and he <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/11/why-the-long-campaign-season-has-been-bad-for-america/264589/\">examines whether my predictions turned out to be accurate</a>.</p> <p><strong>(3)</strong> The Guardian's live-blog for the election is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/06/election-day-obama-romney-live\">here</a>; I'll likely contribute a couple of items to it throughout the night.

Eh, pretty much what Obama has done. Because when it comes to the war on terror, there's not much difference between the two candidates.\" Benjamin Wittes of Lawfare and Brookings <a href=\"http://www.lawfareblog.com/2012/11/thoughts-on-election-day-towards-consensus-and-institutional-settlement/\">makes a similar point today</a>, noting that \"the campaign has been remarkably free of serious disagreements over the basic authorities to prosecute the conflict with overseas terrorist enemies,\" due to the \"remarkable degree of consensus [that] has emerged between the parties as to the basic rules that should govern the American side of the conflict\".</p> <p>Along those lines, Ramesh Ponnuru of the conservative National Review became one of the few mainstream commenters this election to <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-05/why-drones-stayed-out-of-sight-in-the-2012-campaign.html\">write a critical analysis of the US of drones</a>, pointing out the irony that Obama, a fan of the Showtime program \"Homeland,\" \"has heard more discussion of the downside of drone strikes in a television drama than he has in the presidential race.\" </p> <p>(As for \"Homeland\", Columbia Professor Joseph Massad, in Al Jazeera, has a <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2012/10/2012102591525809725.html\">scathing and fascinating attack on the show's politics</a>; it's well worth reading, though I actually disagree with parts of it (though not all) quite vigorously: that show is, in some ways, surprisingly nuanced, even somewhat subversive, as it features a US Marine as a main character who becomes an anti-US \"terrorist\" when the US government orders a drone strike that it knows will kill close to 100 children, kills a young Palestinian boy to whom he had grown close, and then systematically covers up the childrens' death, depicting it all as \"terrorist propaganda\". The show also at times equates top US officials and Muslim terrorists for their propensity to kill civilians in a way that is rarely seen in political discourse, let alone mainstream entertainment).</p> <p><strong>(6)</strong> Relating to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/05/muslim-no-fly-qatar\">yesterday's column about Saddiq Long</a>, the US Muslim placed on a no-fly list with no due process or transparency, Mother Jones' Kevin Drum <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2012/11/kafkaesque-world-no-fly-list\">explains the very clear and simple point</a> raised by that episode, one which remarkably seemed to elude several commenters yesterday eager to defend the US government's actions.</p>",
  "<p>Downing Street's decision to restrict the number of reporters travelling with David Cameron as he tries to sell arms to the Middle East this week has prompted a series of complaints from Westminster journalists, with the BBC political editor, Nick Robinson, taking the unusual step of going on the record to echo dissatisfaction shared widely across the lobby.</p> <p>No 10 granted access to Frank Gardner, the BBC security correspondent, who travelled with Cameron to the United Arab Emirates, prompting speculation that the prime minister's team are trying to secure better coverage by offering individual journalists scoops on trips abroad.</p> <p>Westminster correspondents are routinely invited to travel on the prime minister's plane whenever the head of government goes abroad on official business \u2013 but were surprised to be told in the runup to the Middle East visit that it would not be possible to join him and that there would be little or no access for reporters prepared to travel independently.</p> <p>Cameron arrives in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, as he seeks to advance arms deals and repair political relationships, on a short visit that No 10 made clear that there was little point reporters trying to follow. Lobby journalists \u2013 political reporters granted special access in Westminster and daily No 10 briefings \u2013 who were contemplating following him over from the UAE concluded they may struggle to clear immigration by the time his meetings were completed.</p> <p>Much of the close-knit lobby community is reluctant to criticise No 10 in public, but Robinson told the Guardian that he believed Downing Street had gone too far, even if on this occasion a BBC colleague had benefited. He said: \"There has always been a tension between politicians desire to control the media and political reporters need for access to those in power. For years No 10 has dreamed of stopping journalists travelling on prime ministerial trips. It is important that they remain just that \u2013 dreams.\"</p> <p>Others lobby reporters argue these efforts to tightly manage the media agenda are symptomatic of more short-term political considerations, where an under-pressure No 10 is struggling amid accusations of policy drift and is reeling from its failure to close down running stories such as the Andrew Mitchell \"plebgate\" row. But the sensitive nature of the trip to Dubai and Riyadh, whose regimes are not used to explicit media criticism, also provides a cover for greater restraint.</p> <p>Ironically, on this trip, Cameron has needed to be active on unrelated domestic issues, on Monday announcing an inquiry into whether a previous inquiry into allegations of the sexual abuse of children in care homes in north Wales \"properly did its job\". With an allegation that a senior Thatcher-era politician may have been involved in the abuse, the PM may have welcomed the opportunity to stay in touch with a wider section of the media.</p> <p>But Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair's former director of communications, said this was a difficult situation \"where there is a bit of right on both sides\". He said if the clampdown on the Gulf trip was \"a rare case\" in which using pooled coverage was more appropriate it could be justified, but added: \"If it is part of a broader strategy to limit numbers and cut the media out of access on trips, Nick and others might be more justified in their concerns.\"</p> <p>Close observers of the prime minister also believe Cameron has become increasingly impatient about devoting a significant proportion of his time giving interviews while abroad, when so much of the resulting coverage is critical of him and unrelated to the trip itself. That reflects other developments that suggest his growing lack of enthusiasm for media engagement \u2013 the last of the supposedly \"monthly\" press conferences held by Cameron in fact happened last year.</p> <p>Complicating the picture further is that Craig Oliver, the No 10 director of communications, appointed from the BBC to replace Andy Coulson, is not popular within the lobby itself, and many Westminster journalists believe that he too is under pressure to improve the PM's image. Few want to criticise Oliver publicly because he remains a potential source of news, but he is seen as focused on television, and in particular on the BBC's Six and Ten O'Clock news bulletins \u2013 with little appetite for regular jousting and building relationships with the rest of the press corps.</p> <p>The result of bringing Gardner along was seen on Monday night's Ten O'Clock News programme when he filed <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/i/b01nr0xp/?t=18m34s\" title=\"\">a report towards the end of the evening bulletin</a> which focused on Cameron's visit, his efforts to sell Typhoon jets, and human rights issues in the region. There was no off-topic questioning aired about the swirling allegations of child sex abuse in North Wales that may embroil a once-prominent Conservative politician.</p> <p>When travelling abroad, the prime minister charters a plane, usually from British Airways or Virgin Atlantic, and places are typically provided for newspaper and broadcast journalists who buy an economy class ticket to sit at the back. Aside from Gardner, only a handful of reporters are travelling around with the PM on Monday and Tuesday. Their number comprises two wire journalists, including Joe Churcher, the chief political correspondent with the Press Association \u2013 and a BBC producer and camera person producing pictures to be shared by all broadcasters.</p> <p>Bringing along the press pack guarantees coverage \u2013 broadcasters are usually promised an on-camera interview with the prime minister on the trip \u2013 while press are supposed to be kept busy with a regular supply of briefings to justify the time being spent out of the office by all concerned.</p> <p>However, given the news dominating the headlines tends to be unrelated to the overseas trip in question, the focus of the media tends to be on domestic issues \u2013 and a pack mentality can emerge as reporters chose to converge on a single story.</p> <p>No 10 sources indicated that it was not possible to hire a plane large enough to accommodate the media on the Gulf trip and because of the logistics of the visit, in particular its short duration and the number flights involved.</p> <p><em>\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>The first thought Binta Jobe has on waking each morning is of the day she was taken, aged nine, by family, into the bush and forced to undergo female genital mutilation (FGM). It was done without anaesthetic, by an old woman with no medical training. Now the 23-year-old Liverpool-based asylum seeker from the Gambia is fighting to save her three-year-old daughter, Aisha, from the same fate.</p> <p>The World Health Organisation defines FGM as \"all procedures that involve partial or total removal or injury of the external female genitalia for non-medical reasons\". It estimates that up to 140 million females worldwide have experienced the procedure, including 92 million in Africa.</p> <p>\"I dream of blood,\" says Jobe, who suffers recurrent infections, sexual problems and pain as a result of the surgery. \"It's an abuse. I just want Aisha to be able to grow up stronger than I am. We have no choice about it in our country. I did not understand that I had rights until I came to the UK.\"</p> <p>Jobe arrived in the UK in 2008 to join her husband who had come to study. Within weeks of Aisha's birth, there was talk of arranging her circumcision. Jobe fled with her daughter. She applied for asylum in 2010, based on her belief that she and her daughter will be tracked down by extended family and Aisha subjected to FGM if they are forced to return to the Gambia.</p> <p>FGM is still legal in the Gambia, where, according to Unicef, about 78% of the female population undergo the procedure. Under the UN 1951 Refugee Convention, fear of being forced into FGM is grounds for seeking asylum. It is also regarded by the UN as torture and as \"inhuman and degrading\". Yet the UK Border Agency (UKBA) refused Jobe's application for asylum and her last appeal was turned down in September 2012.</p> <p>\"After careful consideration, both we and the courts have ruled that [Jobe] is not in need of asylum. The court found [she] could live safely elsewhere in the Gambia and that the law provided sufficient protection for her and her daughter,\" says a UKBA spokesman.</p> <p>The government launched the UK's first <a href=\"http://www.janeellison.net/newsdisplay.php/2011-12-07/new_parliamentary_group_on_female_genital_mutilation_launched\" title=\"\">all-party parliamentary group on FGM</a> in December 2011 to address FGM both here and abroad. FGM is illegal in the UK under the 2003 Female Genital Mutilation Act, as is sending UK residents abroad to undergo the procedure.</p> <p>Jobe's case has been taken up by human rights lawyer, Peggy Layoo, who is applying for a judicial review. Layoo condemns UKBA's stance as \"utter hypocrisy\".</p> <p>She says: \"FGM is akin to rape, but it is not being taken seriously by UKBA. It is a denial of the suffering of women in the third world. We all know that FGM is going on, yet the government does not want to do anything about it.\"</p> <p>A 2001 study estimated 66,000 African women in England and Wales had undergone FGM, and a further 23,000 girls under the age of 15 were at risk. Jobe's case is viewed by many of those working with asylum seekers as the tip of the iceberg.</p> <p>Jobe's pupils dilate with fear at the prospect of returning to the Gambia. She was only 13 when she was married against her will to a family friend more than 20&#xa0;years older than her. She cannot read or write. Young women like herself live in compounds in the Gambia with an extended family and she says a single woman arriving in this small country would stand out and be found by family who would punish her for going against her culture.</p> <p>\"If I go back to the Gambia I might as well just say, 'Here I am, come and take me.' It is a place of gossip and they will just track me down. I will just end up losing my child,\" Jobe says.</p> <p>Sylvia Chant, professor of developmental geography at the London School of Economics and an expert on the Gambia, submitted a report as evidence to back Jobe's case. She agrees that Jobe would have few options \u2013 for example, prostitution \u2013 if she returned to the Gambia, that both she and Aisha would be extremely vulnerable to violent victimisation and neither would receive any state protection.</p> <p>UKBA says the Gambia has begun making moves to change the culture around FGM, working with Gamcotrap, one of the oldest women's rights NGOs in the Gambia, and through local \"dropping of the knife\" ceremonies.</p> <p>Lauren Butler, an immigration case worker at Rochdale Law Centre, is working on four asylum cases similar to Jobe's involving FGM. She thinks UKBA's decisions are often based on unreliable sources and are made from a middle-class, white perspective. \"They are not apprehending the situation. It is something between wilful ignorance and cultural disbelief,\" she says.</p> <p>UKBA states: \"Female genital mutilation is an abhorrent crime, and we are working with international agencies to help prevent women and girls becoming victims.\"</p> <p>But Maurice Wren, director of charity Asylum Aid, accuses the government of double standards. He says: \"At a time when government is publicly promising action against FGM practised in the UK, it is appalling to think that women and girls who have claimed asylum here are being sent back to face exactly the same abuse overseas.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Some names have been changed</p>",
  "<p>When Johann Lamont, Scotland's Labour leader, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-19711805\" title=\"\">called for</a> a mature debate on the funding of Scotland's cherished public services, from free personal and nursing care to free NHS prescriptions and tuition-free universities, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/28/scottish-labour-hostility-snp\" title=\"\">outcry</a> was predictable.</p> <p>She was <a href=\"http://www.snp.org/blog/post/2012/oct/nicola-sturgeon-defends-universal-benefits\" title=\"\">accused</a> by the SNP government of moving to destroy \"shared social bonds\". And some Labour activists privately questioned the timing of her <a href=\"http://news.stv.tv/politics/191807-labour-leader-johann-lamont-demands-end-to-something-for-nothing-culture/\" title=\"\">speech</a> at the end of September, when Lamont cautioned: \"This is the stark choice Scotland has to face: if we wish to continue some policies as they are, they come with a cost that has to be paid for either through increased taxation or direct charges or cuts elsewhere.\"</p> <p>With the temperature in the great constitutional debate rising two years before an independence referendum, could Lamont's musings prove to be a high-risk strategy? \"Telling the truth, and confronting the challenge, is what politics is about,\" she replies. \"People need an honest appraisal of what the choices are.\"</p> <p>She has already raised several questions about those choices. What, for instance, is progressive about a chief executive on \u00a3100,000 a year getting free prescriptions when a pensioner has to endure cuts in a care package; or a well-paid lawyer escaping fees for children at university when one in four unemployed young people in Scotland cannot get into further education as colleges struggle with cuts, Lamont has asked.</p> <p>Since becoming Labour leader in Holyrood last year, she has certainly made an impact, if the effect she is having on a normally bullish, combative first minister Alex Salmond is anything to go by. \"She's getting under his skin like no predecessor,\" says a seasoned observer in the Holyrood debating chamber.</p> <p>We meet in her parliamentary office, shortly before a debate initiated by Labour on the future of an independent Scotland in the European Union.</p> <p>Lamont, 55, is relaxed, thoughtful, engaging, and determined that the independence debate will not dominate the political agenda for the next two years. \"Some people define the only change as constitutional change,\" she says. \"That's the first challenge. I've always said that Alex Salmond has the mandate to ask the question. But there is a presumption made among nationalists that constitutional change is the answer to all the questions that are problematic in our communities, and my job is to talk about what is happening in the real world,\" she stresses.</p> <p>Our conversation begins with the community politics, dear to her heart, in her native Glasgow. She enthuses about community-based housing associations and co-operatives meeting local needs, rather than faceless, remote social landlords, then recalls with affection a rewarding, 20-year teaching career before entering the Scottish parliament in 1999. Although she taught English, her work involved liaising with social workers, and education psychologists, \"largely asking 'Why do children fall out of school?'\" she explains.</p> <p>\"I've got a very deep and abiding passion about education being far more than buildings and textbooks; it's what children bring into school with them. A&#xa0;lot of our job was drawing youngsters into school, working with families,\" she says.</p> <p>Although labelled a Blairite by SNP critics after the Edinburgh speech, which received lurid <a href=\"http://newsnetscotland.com/index.php/scottish-politics/5920-no-more-something-for-nothing-as-lamont-attacks-universal-benefits\" title=\"\">headlines</a> about Lamont demanding an end to the \"something for nothing\" culture, those close to the Scottish Labour leader say she could never be labelled new Labour. Rather, she is rooted to older party values, with a deep commitment to fairness. Perhaps this explains why Lamont, never afraid of the socialist label, believes that at a time of a shrinking Scottish budget Labour has to address the language of priorities. She takes comfort from a <a href=\"http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2011/06/27154527/0\" title=\"\">report</a> by the commission on public service delivery for the Scottish government, chaired by the late Scottish TUC general secretary Campbell Christie, and published last year. \"He talked about 'competing demands' \u2013 something we have to wrestle with. There are lots of things you aspire to, but how do you make sure they are funded? What I'm frustrated by is simply an assertion that things are fine when we know in our communities that things are not.\"</p> <p>She volunteers one example: free personal and nursing care for elderly and infirm people in Scotland \u2013 but not, of course, in England. Her critique might surprise many south of the border. Annual costs are creeping towards \u00a3500m. \"To have this, it's got to be properly funded. It can't be when you say we've got this fantastic policy \u2026 when, at the same time, the threshold to access care is increased, when you charge for things \u2026 you did not charge for in the past \u2013 community alarms, or whatever \u2013 when you drive down most terms and conditions and you've got what care workers describe to me as a job of \"task and go\" \u2013 go into people's homes for 15&#xa0;minutes then back out the door. That's not care. Is it acceptable that someone is tucked up in a bed at 6pm because of the pressure care workers are under? We've got care workers, particularly in the private sector, who are not even getting paid for travel time.\"</p> <p>She adds: \"What I want is a much more serious debate about the scale of the challenge because I do think there's an awful lot hidden. Now if we've not got a compassionate care system \u2013 and a government that says it's so fantastic we won't even look at it. But it bears no relation to what's happening in families and communities \u2013 that is unacceptable.\"</p> <p>This, of course, begs a wider question: should prescription charges (which cost approaching \u00a360m annually) be free for everyone? \"I think we need to ask those questions,\" she replies. \"If&#xa0;I&#xa0;believe we need free personal care, we need an honest discussion about what it costs with a well-managed, well-trained workforce.\"</p> <p>So charging, then, for some services that are currently free? Lamont pauses briefly. \"We have said we need to look at all of these policies. We can't have what is currently the position, where we assert one thing and the reality is something different. I would emphasise again that we [the Scottish Labour party] supported the policy [originally], but, in&#xa0;my view, there's nothing credible about supporting a policy without the means for it to be delivered.\"</p> <p>Lamont's further gripe is a council tax freeze launched as a stopgap measure in 2007-08 by the then minority SNP administration, pending the introduction of a local income tax. When the party ditched the local income tax proposal, fearing an electoral backlash, it continued with a freeze. The result is that local government in Scotland is arguably now more centralised than its English counterpart. Lamont says: \"The logic of the SNP position, with all Scottish councils getting the same compensation to keep the tax frozen for the past five years, is that the council tax will wither on the vine. The freeze is&#xa0;underfunded.\"</p> <p>Of one thing she is sure. \"We will not get back to 2010 funding levels for another 16 years. The demographics of Scotland tell you there's a challenge ahead.

  "<p>A Bradford bus driver should not have been sacked for being a member of the British National Party, the European court of human rights has ruled.</p> <p>Removing Arthur Redfearn, a BNP councillor, from his job transporting disabled passengers \u2013 most of whom were of Asian descent \u2013 breached his rights to freedom of association, the Strasbourg court declared.</p> <p>\"In a healthy democratic and pluralistic society, the right to freedom of association&#xa0;\u2026 must apply not only to people or associations whose views are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive, but also to those whose views offend, shock or disturb,\" the judgment said.</p> <p>The decision, by a majority of four votes to three, was one of three cases in a single day in which the United Kingdom was found to have violated individuals' rights under the European convention on human rights.</p> <p>The ruling on Redfearn, who was 56 when dismissed in 2004 by his employer, Serco, noted that: \"Prior to his political affiliation becoming public knowledge, no complaints had been made against him by service users or by his colleagues.</p> <p>\"Nevertheless, once he was elected as a local councillor for the BNP and complaints were received from unions and employees, he was summarily dismissed without any apparent consideration being given to the possibility of transferring him to a non-customer-facing role.\"</p> <p>It added: \"It was incumbent on the [UK] to take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect employees, including those with less than one year's service, from dismissal on grounds of political opinion or affiliation.\"</p> <p>Redfearn had initially appealed against his sacking on the grounds that he was the victim of race discrimination. An employment tribunal had, however, dismissed his claim in 2005, finding that any discrimination against him had been on health and safety grounds.</p> <p>His continued employment, the tribunal had said, could cause considerable anxiety among Serco's passengers and their carers. There was consequently a risk that Serco's vehicles could come under attack from opponents of the BNP.</p> <p>Redfearn had been refused leave to take his case to the House of Lords but pursued it at Strasbourg.</p> <p>The dissenting ruling by three ECHR judges, including the UK judge Sir Nicolas Bratza, found there had not been a violation of Article 11 of the convention, the right to freedom of association. Redfearn had been working for less than a year and his employment rights, they argued, were not as extensive as those who had been working for the qualifying one year period.</p> <p>\"In a complex area of social and economic policy,\" the three judges observed, \"it is in our view pre-eminently for parliament to decide what areas require special protection in the field of employment and the consequent scope of any exception created to the general rule.\"</p> <p>In a separate case in Strasbourg, the UK was unanimously found to have discriminated against a Djibouti refugee, Hawa Aden Abdi, who was refused permission to join her husband in England.</p> <p>Abdii and Ilyas Elmi Hode, who have two children, married after he was granted asylum in the UK in 2006. The ECHR noted that UK immigration rules have since been amended.</p> <p>In a third judgment, the court found that the UK violated the rights to a fair trial within a reasonable time of a convicted murderer, William Beggs, 49, because his legal appeals had taken too long.</p> <p>In its ruling, the ECHR said: \"The appeal proceedings had lasted 10 years, three months and 21 days. Although the case was complex, this did not in itself justify appeal proceedings which lasted over 10 years.</p> <p>\"A substantial proportion of the delay had been caused by the applicant's own conduct. However, there were also periods of inactivity where the courts had failed to take steps to progress matters of their own motion, and this led the court to find a violation of the right to trial within a reasonable time.\"</p> <p>Beggs was awarded \u20ac6,000 (\u00a34,820) in damages and costs. The decision against the UK on delay is highly unusual. As the court added: \"The vast majority of [delay] cases involved Ukraine, Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary, Italy and Poland. There was only one finding of a violation in respect of the United Kingdom.\"</p> <p>Audrey Williams, partner and discrimination law expert at global law firm Eversheds, commented:</p> <p>\"The government is likely to ask for the case to be referred to the Strasbourg court's grand chamber, to be re-examined by a full panel of 17 judges. It is not often that the grand chamber will agree to look again at an issue but it may well do so in this case given that Tuesday's decision was reached by the barest of majorities: of the 7 judges on the panel that considered the case, only four felt that UK law needs to change; the other three disagreed, saying our domestic law is fine as it is.</p> <p>\"If the grand chamber does not overrule today's decision, UK law will have to change to give employees with short service the right to claim unfair dismissal if they have been dismissed because of their political affiliation, for example because of BNP membership.</p> <p>\"At the moment only those with a year's service or more can bring such claims \u2013 or two years' service for those engaged after 5 April this year due to changes introduced recently by the government. Until the law is changed, private sector employees are unlikely to benefit from this ruling.\"</p> <p>A Department for Business Spokesperson said:</p> <p>\"While disappointed with the decision, we're pleased that the court has recognised the validity of a general qualifying period for the right to claim unfair dismissal. The court has also rightly recognised that a balance must be struck between the interests of employers and employees where these come into conflict due to an individual's political affiliation. The government will examine the detail of the judgment and decide on a way forward in due course.\"</p>",

  "<p>Sir Alex Ferguson took over as the Manchester United manager 26 years ago today. That number might not sound worthy of celebration, but the phrase \"26 years\" is burnt indelibly into the minds of United fans. For 26 years after the 1966-67 season, they waited for the club to be crowned league champions. </p> <p>Matt Busby, Wilf McGuinness, Frank O'Farrell, Tommy Docherty and Ron Atkinson all tried to bring the title back to Old Trafford, but it took the appointment of Ferguson to restore the club to their former glories. On the Sunday after Ferguson moved from Aberdeen to Manchester United, the Observer ran two pieces on the appointment. </p> <h2>Five men lost to one man's United by Frank McGhee</h2> <blockquote> <p>Frank McGhee, a sports journalist who had followed United for 36 years, recalled the club's turbulent past and explained why no manager had ever been able to emulate the success of Matt Busby. McGhee argued that each of his successors had lacked the \"arrogant ego\" required to dominate as dressing room and bring success to the club. As time has told, Ferguson has no worries in that department.</p> </blockquote> <p>The manager Manchester United really need, have desperately lacked and would love to have is unavailable and disqualified for one reason. He is 76 years old. But if they can't get Sir Matt Busby, it is obvious that they must look for someone with almost all that marvellous man's qualities \u2013 reaching for the lot would be asking for a bit much. </p> <p>The indications are that in Alex Ferguson they may have come fairly close to hitting the target, even though the most they can hope for is an inner rather than a bullseye. </p> <p>None of Ferguson's predecessors came anywhere near because, in one way or another, they all lacked at least one of those qualities and it may surprise those who don't know the man, even some of those who think they do, that the most important is the arrogant ego Busby so successfully concealed beneath layers of warmth, kindness, knowledge of and love for the game that perhaps even he didn't realise it was there. </p> <p>It was there right from the day in October, 1945, he decided he would accept the proper job as United manager \"only if they would let me have all my own way. As the manager I would want to be the boss.\" Shortly afterwards, the then chairman, James Gibson, a famous autocrat, suggested he should sign an available player from Newcastle United. Matt said \"no, he is not good for us\" and when the chairman, by then in an apoplectic rage, ordered the signing Matt said: \"I'll remind you of two things, Mr Chairman. I'm here to manage the club and part of management is giving you advice. The second is that I lived long before I ever saw you.\" </p> <p>James Gibson never interfered again, nor did any other director, particularly the one who leaned forward in the posh seats during a match and in loud-voiced ignorance asked Matt why he wasn't adopting different tactics. Matt caught up with him quietly in the gents, to advise with soft menace: \"Never dare say anything like that to me when other people can hear you.\" He then put on the agenda for the next board meeting the item \"interference by directors\". </p> <p>Has Alex Ferguson that sort of self-confidence? Ron Atkinson, for all his front-as-big-as-Blackpool, possibly hadn't. Busby would never have agreed to sell a player he wanted to keep and surely Atkinson must have wanted to keep Mark Hughes. </p> <p>Wilf McGuinness, the first successor, certainly didn't possess the required self-belief. He was the lance corporal who continued to call Busby \"boss\" and thereby unwittingly forfeited the respect of the other privates in the barrack room. Two men who could have had the job at around the same time, Jock Stein of Celtic, and Don Revie of Leeds, would never have committed a similar error. </p> <p>In fact, when Revie was asked by Jack Charlton how he wanted to be addressed after elevation from dressing room to manager's office he said: \"From now on it's boss, ok?\" Frank O'Farrell, the man who did get the job next, was a thoroughly decent, likeable and knowledgeable Irish Catholic, an extra qualification that incidentally did him no harm in the eyes of a devout left-footer, Busby. By the same token Matt would never favour a Catholic over a Hottentot if the other guy was a better player. The only man he required to hold a cross was his goalkeeper. Ferguson undoubtedly fits that requirement also. </p> <p>O'Farrell was, however, never in Busby's class as a manager of men, a motivator or a communicator. \"He came as a stranger and he left as a stranger,\" was the caustic comment of Denis Law, one of the quartet completed by Duncan Edwards, George Best and Bobby Charlton who rank as Matt's all-time favourites. </p> <p>Neither O'Farrell nor any other successor could match Busby in public relations. Most significant was O'Farrell's failure to cope with Best and, to set the record straight, Georgie never did anything wrong at Old Trafford under Busby without being punished and invariably apologising \u2013 before doing it again, of course. </p> <p>Matt was wise and warm but never soft. </p> <p>A sports reporter on the Manchester Evening News travelled just once in Matt and Manchester United's company on a trip to London in 1950 and watched in awe as great players of that era, Johnny Carey, Jack Rowley, Charlie Mitten, etc., walked around the manager in wide, wary circles. </p> <p>That same reporter, then on the Daily Mirror, didn't see him again for four years. It was outside Hampden Park, with thousands of strangers milling around, that Matt said instantly: \"Frank McGhee. How are ye son, good to see ye.\" He remembered with his uncanny knack of putting names to faces and in that moment captured an affection he has never lost. Respect, admiration and friendship all blossomed over many years. He had to hurt many players by dropping, selling and discarding them over those years but it provides its own tribute that so few ever resent it. </p> <p>It is unreasonable to expect any successor to have quite the same knack or anything like the deep love for United Busby shows, though undoubtedly Tommy Docherty will insist that he came as close as possible to matching it. But, for all his enthusiasm, bounce and near-genius for motivation, Tommy was, in show business terms, a talented lightweight patter comedian in the shadow of a great star of awesome magnitude. Still, at least Tommy always gave a convincing impersonation of being willing to seek advice from Matt. Pity he was always also destined to provide the source of his own downfall. He did a great deal for United, then threw it all away. </p> <p>At times he provided something like the football Busby had led Old Trafford fans to first expect and then demand. The next manager, Dave Sexton, unfortunately, didn't \u2013 even though Matt's hopes for him were initially the highest. \"Dave could be the one we've been waiting for,\" was Busby's own accolade at the time. </p> <p>It must be psychologically significant that in their 15-year search for a successor, the pendulum has swung so contrastingly. From the tail-wagging friendly puppy of McGuinness to the sober, serious O'Farrell. From Docherty's wisecracking ebullience to Sexton's simmering, brooding silences. Like O'Farrell before him, Dave's academy was the West Ham one, and for the Old Trafford school that meant too much blackboard, not enough jungle. </p> <p>Atkinson provided another contrast. As extroverted as Docherty, he never somehow struck the same accord as Tommy with the people who really own this club, no matter what the record in the directory of directors may say. The fans were never given by Atkinson what they see as their occasional right, the championship. Busby did it five times, came second seven times and that is what they have been seeking so hungrily ever since. That is what is required of Ferguson. He needs to be another Busby and maybe this chunk of newsprint will give him some idea of what is required. </p> <h2>The joker who hates defeat by Patrick Glenn</h2> <blockquote> <p>The second piece in the Observer on Sunday 8 November, 1986, was written by Patrick Glenn, a Scottish football writer who had tracked the young manager's career north of the border. Glenn's experience of Ferguson showed that the manager had the competitive desire required to handle his new job \u2013 and his final sentence about the silence at Old Trafford has proved oddly prescient.</p> </blockquote> <p>When Martin Edwards offered Alex Ferguson the Manchester United job last Thursday, it was as if the Big Fisherman himself had held out the key to the Pearly Gates. The very idea of Ferguson's non-acceptance was absurd. </p> <p>His irresistible competitiveness \u2013&#xa0;at times, it borders on the psychopathic \u2013 has long been sustained by apparently endless energy, and to have refused the biggest club in Britain would have seemed to Ferguson a self-betrayal deserving of hara-kiri. </p> <p>Now, he can leave the ceremonial sword in its sheath and get on with giving players, journalists, cleaners, directors, tea ladies, secretaries and all who come and go at football grounds a mixture of hard times, merciless ribbing, perhaps the formation of a quiz league embracing every subject possible and, most importantly, the unmistakable impression that here is a man who knows the most direct route towards his destiny. </p> <p>Ferguson's unshakable commitment to whatever cause he espouses has been evident since, as a teenager, he led his fellow apprentice toolmakers' industrial action at their factory on the south side of Glasgow. Later, he would become chairman of the Scottish Professional Footballers' Association. </p> <p>He is an almost inconsolable loser, whether in football, his beloved quizzes or in life itself. In his earliest days as manager of St Mirren, still in the Scottish first division, he took his team to Clydebank to face his closest rivals in the chase for promotion to the premier division. It was a complete sell-out and, when Saints went 2-0 down, Fergie could be seen leaping from the dugout in a clear attempt at throttling the linesman nearest to him. It was Christmas Day. </p> <p>Scotland manager Andy Roxburgh swears that Ferguson has not forgiven him his lapse almost 20 years ago during a round of 'Quiz Ball,' a popular television game for football clubs at the time. They were both on the Falkirk side and Roxburgh was asked which jockey had won the previous year's Grand National. </p> <p>Totally ignorant of horseracing, he became more nervous as he heard Fergie stage-whispering and trying to throw pieces of paper his way. Desperately, he blurted out \"Lester Piggott\", crediting the world's greatest flat jockey with victory in the world's most famous steeplechase. From the other end of the table, he heard Ferguson groan loudly, \"Aw, Jeeesus Christ!\"</p> <p>On the Saturday Falkirk had a League match at Brockville and as Roxburgh took the field \u2013 and here, he is convinced Alex had actually used a loud hailer to organise the fans \u2013 the entire crowd in the covered enclosure rose at once and chanted, \"Les-ter Pig-gott, Les-ter Pig-gott\". </p> <p>As St Mirren manager, Ferguson used a van with a loud hailer to tour the working class areas of Paisley, exhorting people to come to matches. When he took over at Love Street, after just months experience with East Stirling, crowds were down to less than 1,000. When be left, 10,000 was commonplace, not counting matches against Celtic and Rangers. </p> <p>Nobody with his sense of urgency could accomplish what he has without littering his trail with incident and controversy. Tales of flying tea-sets in dressing rooms at half-time are both plentiful and authentic. He has been known to batter on a referee's door during the interval of a match with his team leading 3-0 and on the way to clinching the league championship. </p> <p>But for all the volatile aggressiveness, he is an incurable joker. During Scotland's World Cup preparations in Santa Fe, New Mexico, he discovered an attractive lounge with a beautiful, white grand piano. He asked the manager about it and was told that it played automatically. For a fee, they could arrange to make it look as though he was playing. </p> <p>The deal was done and that night Fergie took the entire backroom staff out to dinner. When he offered to play the piano (\"I'll admit it's been some time,\" he said) the disbelief was obvious. But, with every action exaggerated, it came out as pure Semprini. </p> <p>Teddy Scott, Fergie's colleague at Aberdeen, couldn't recover. \"I thought I knew everything,\" said Teddy. \"During his time with us, he has told me everything, described in detail every daft goal he ever scored and all the easy chances he ever missed. He never keeps quiet, but I never knew he could play the piano.\"</p> <p>Now he will be playing to one of the most demanding audiences in the game and that will make him totally satisfied. Despite his semi-love of Aberdeen FC, he was never at one with fans who, he would say \"sit on their hands\". Alluding to a woeful lack of vociferous support during a big European match one night, he said: \"There was more noise at my granny's funeral.\" </p> <p>With him at Old Trafford, silence will be a golden rarity. </p> <h2>Aiming for the championship</h2> <p>Ferguson began his career at United with a 2-0 defeat at Oxford United and a goalless draw at newly promoted Norwich City. His first win came at Old Trafford against QPR on November 22, 1986. In <a href=\"http://twitter.yfrog.com/z/h0rasihj\">his programme notes before that game</a> Ferguson wrote: \"Taking over a club of the magnitude of Manchester United is an awesome prospect. But ultimately a football club is a football club and I shall simply try to run things at Old Trafford in what I believe to be the right way.</p> <p>\"I am not really interested in what has happened here in the past. I don't mean any disrespect to the great achievements of Manchester United over the years. It's simply that now there is only one way to go, and that is forward. The aim at this club must clearly be to win the championship.\" </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/845j6zfRHz8?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/845j6zfRHz8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/series/fromthevault\">Read other stories from the Vault</a> and share your memories Alex Ferguson's time at Manchester United below</h2>",
  "<h2>Tuesday's best bets, by Chris Cook</h2> <p>Blimey, odds-on about Cue Card. That's not quite what I was hoping for when I picked him for today's big race, the Haldon Gold Cup at Exeter, and I'll certainly find a way to resist backing him at 10-11.</p> <p>There was a point last season when it looked as if Colin Tizzard's star was going to have a disappointing career, after he'd unseated at Cheltenham and got short-headed by Bobs Worth at Newbury. But that looks pretty good form, now that we know Bobs Worth was on his way to winning the RSA at the Festival, while Cue Card went on to beat For Non Stop by four lengths on New Year's Eve. That's another bit of good form, though For Non Stop must have improved to run away with the Old Roan like he did at the weekend.</p> <p>Cue Card was last seen chasing home Sprinter Sacre in the Arkle, almost half-threatening to give the winner a race, which is as much as any chaser has done against that mighty beast. Menorah was 22 lengths back in third and is 3lb worse off with Cue Card this time.</p> <p>Cue Card has won whenever he's been odds-on in the past (three times) and he may very well get it done today. Tizzard is a good, in-form trainer and I bet he'll have him fit.</p> <p>Still, Edgardo Sol is a threat. He's a young, highly progressive beast and, although I worry that he might need his first run, as he appeared to last season, I'd rather have him at 5s than the fav at odds-on. If I'd realised the market was going to be like this, I'd have gone with Edgardo Sol.</p> <p>Hinterland is a rather more predictable hotpot for the following novice chase at 2-5. I wouldn't take that price but I am having a bit of 14-1 about him for the Arkle this morning because chasing is the job he looks made for and he is pretty quick.</p> <p>My involvement at Exeter is going to be limited to <strong>Mohayer (3.50)</strong>, available at 18-1 as I type. He won a couple of low-value handicap chases at the start of last season, then finished with three pulled-up efforts on the trot in races worth \u00a332k or more to the winner. Now that he's fresh again and back in a \u00a36k race, he should be dangerous once more and he's only 2lb higher than for his last win. He copes well with mud but I don't think he has to have it.</p> <p>At Wolverhampton tonight, Raul Da Silva has a good book of rides and might make some inroads on Amy Ryan's lead of seven in the apprentice title race, though she looks almost across the line now. In particular, I like his chance on <strong>Precision Five (6.00)</strong>, who managed to win on her handicap debut at Lingfield in August despite having a difficult run through the race. Jeremy Gask hasn't rushed this three-year-old back to the track and she's only 4lb higher. You can get 9-2.</p> <h2>Blue Square tipping competition result</h2> <p>carl31 +25</p> <p>millreef +25</p> <p>lasramblas +25</p> <p>paddytheirishman1 +16</p> <p>ToffeeDan1 +1.50</p> <p>diegoisgod +1.50</p> <p>snowy81 +1.50</p> <p>melonk +0</p> <p>sandiuk +0</p> <p>fatfrank29 +0</p> <p>orso +0</p> <p>chiefhk +0 X</p> <p>Harrytheactor +0</p> <p>Congratulations to paddytheirishman1, who was the only one to pick Melbourne Cup winner Green Moon (19-1).

  "<h2>Chuck Pagano remains part of the Colts' success</h2> <p>The light is still on in Chuck Pagano's office. When the Indianapolis Colts head coach was told he had leukemia, this September, Bruce Arians \u2013 the team's offensive co-ordinator and Pagano's interim replacement \u2013 requested that the light not be switched off until his colleague had returned to work. The team's owner, Jim Irsay, agreed.</p> <p>This week <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/football/nfl/10/29/colts-chuck-pagano-facility-visit.ap/index.html\">Pagano was back at the team's facility for the first time since that diagnosis</a>, visiting his colleagues and sitting in on team meetings for a few hours. It was made clear, however, that there is not yet any time-frame for a possible return to work. Pagano's treatment is ongoing, and from this week he is set to undergo a second round of chemotherapy.</p> <p>Sooner or later, though, Pagano intends to return. He made that clear when he followed up his practice-facility visit by attending the Colts' 23-20 win over Miami on Sunday, delivering a pep-talk to the team before the game and another afterwards. <a href=\"http://www.colts.com/media-center/videos/Coach-Pagano-Locker-Room-Speech-Dolphins/ab62385f-1e06-4136-b3d5-0cfde2a7a4fe\">A video of the post-game speech was posted online by the Colts</a>.</p> <p>Pagano praised the players for ignoring the expectations that analysts and others outside the organisation had for the team coming into the season, and focusing only on their own goals. He then compared their situation to his own. Powerful would be an understatement.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I mentioned before the game that you guys were living in [your] vision, and you weren't living in circumstances. Because you know where they had us in the beginning \u2013 every last one of them. But you refused to live in circumstances, and you decided consciously, as a team and as a family, to live in a vision. And that's why you bring things home like you brought home today. That's why you're already champions, and well on your way.</p> <p>I've got circumstances \u2013 you guys understand it, and I understand it. It's already beat. It's already beat. And my vision that I'm living is to see two more daughters get married, dance at their weddings, and then hoist that Lombardi [Trophy] several times. I'm dancing at two more weddings, and we're hoisting that trophy together, men.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Pagano's road to recovery is still a long one. He is responding well to treatment, and as of Monday <a href=\"http://www.indystar.com/article/20121105/SPORTS03/121105032/Doctors-Chuck-Pagano-s-cancer-remission?odyssey=mod|breaking|text|IndyStar.com&amp;nclick_check=1\">his doctors deemed the cancer to be in remission</a>. But the words written by Sports Illustrated's Peter King in his <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/peter_king/11/05/Week-9/index.html\">Monday Morning Quarterback column</a> hold true: </p> <blockquote> <p>The story doesn't have a happy ending. Yet. Not for the Colts, and not for Pagano. \"This next round of treatment's going to be brutal,'' Arians said. \"He could be down and out for a while. But he felt good today, and so he wanted to come in and see the guys. It helped, big time. It's good for him, good for us.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Arians had previously challenged his team to make the playoffs \u2013 extending their season so that Pagano would have more time to make it back from his treatment before it ended. With the Colts 5-3 after beating Miami and 4-1 since the coach's diagnosis, that no longer sounds as improbable as it once did.</p> <h2>Andrew Luck was worth that No1 pick...</h2> <p>Everyone will focus on the numbers. Andrew Luck's passing statistics were indeed remarkable on Sunday night \u2013 the quarterback threw for a rookie-record 433 yards, as well as two touchdowns and no interceptions, in the win over Miami. They also reflected to some extent how he gave his best in the clutch \u2013 going 13 of 17 for 204 yards and a score on third down.</p> <p>But to fully comprehend the brilliance of Luck's performance against Miami on Sunday you would have needed to see it: to witness how he moved in the pocket, how he went through progressions even when under pressure, the \"I don't see you but I know where you are\" awareness that allowed him to step away from pass rushers at the perfect moment.</p> <p>One play has dominated the highlight reels \u2013 Luck hit by the Miami defender Cameron Wake on third-and-three but <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/0ap2000000090776/Luck-and-Wayne-connect-on-key-third-down\">somehow contriving to throw a perfect six-yard dart to Reggie Wayne in traffic while falling</a>. Yet there were so many other less heralded moments, such as another third-and-three in the first quarter when a defender came flying at Luck's ankles \u2013 this time he stepped back to leave his opponent sprawling, before stepping up to hit Wayne on the sideline.</p> <p>\"He's going to be real special,\" said Wayne afterwards, and as a man who spent the first 10 years of his career catching passes from Peyton Manning, he should know. In a curious statistical quirk, Luck has now thrown for the exact same number of yards as Manning this season, and also has the exact same number of wins. His performance to date, though, is exciting for so much more than just numerical reasons.</p> <h2>...and Doug Martin was worth more than the 31st </h2> <p>If Luck looks like a natural then his fellow rookie Doug Martin is quick to acknowledge he is still learning his profession. The Tampa Bay running back, selected with the 31st overall pick in this year's draft, picked up just 31 yards on eight carries in the first half against the Raiders, before the team's head coach advised him that his tendency to dip his head while going through the line was causing him to lose his footing.</p> <p>\"I was getting to the line stumbling on a few runs and then coach told me: 'Just keep your head up,'\" said Martin. \"After that, I did what he said and it helped me keep my balance and then, it was off to the races.\"</p> <p>If these were indeed races then there was only one horse in them (or perhaps one Muscle Hamster, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JeffDarlington/statuses/265240761673609216\">as the player was nicknamed, much to his chagrin, at Boise State</a>). In the second half Martin would tear off touchdown runs of 45, 67 and 70 yards \u2013 as well as ploughing in for another score from one yard out. He would finish with 251 rushing yards \u2013 a team record and the 10th most in league history.</p> <p>His numbers might have looked even more impressive, too, were it not for the fact that he lost 14 on the Bucs' final drive, with the team trying to run out the clock. Or indeed if the team had not sent in LeGarrette Blount to spell Martin early in the fourth quarter, only to see him promptly cough up a fumble.</p> <p>And if no back could ever sustain this level of performance every game, then it is also true that Martin went for 214 total yards against the Minnesota Vikings last week. One or two of those teams who passed him up on draft day might be beginning to feel a little foolish.</p> <h2>Chicago's defense is scary</h2> <p>Life is about to get more difficult for the Bears, who face the Houston Texans and San Francisco 49ers over the next two weeks, but after seeing them demolish the Tennessee Titans 51-20 on Sunday it is easy to believe that they can live with both of those teams. They have outscored their opponents so far this season by an average of 14.5 points. Their points differential, +116, is the best in the league.</p> <p>The offense has been clicking \u2013 Jay Cutler throwing for three touchdowns, all of them to Brandon Marshall, on Sunday and Matt Forte averaging five yards per carry so far this season on the ground. But it is undoubtedly the defense that makes this team look ominous.</p> <p>Five turnovers against the Titans improved the Bears' turnover ratio to +16 on the season \u2013 the best such mark of any team in the league. Cornerback Charles \"Peanut\" Tillman forced four fumbles, moving him up to second on the all-time lists with 34 in his career. \"It's only a suggestion but CB Charles Tillman might want to consider a post-football career as a thief,\" <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/blog/nfl-rapidreports/20835474/bears-report-card-bigplay-defense-gets-joined-by-offense-special-teams\">wrote Gene Chamberlain on CBSSports.com</a>.</p> <p>Nor has this happened by accident. The Bears dedicate time in practice to forcing fumbles on defense as well as avoiding them on offense. <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/chris_harry/01/24/art.of.fumble/index.html\">So do many other teams</a>, of course, but right now Chicago are just doing it better.</p> <h2>Mitt Romney is going to win the presidential election.

In the Iowan capital Des Moines, Obama spoke to a packed downtown rally of 20,000 people braving freezing temperatures.</p> <p>It was a moment of poignant memories for the First Couple. \u201cI have come back to Iowa one more time to ask for your vote,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is where our movement began.\u201d</p> <p>Obama recounted tales of his early campaign, talking of a bare bones operation in 2008 that turned American politics on its head. \u201cYou welcomed me and Michelle into your homes,\u201d he said. He also told a lengthy anecdote about how his old campaign slogan of \u201cfired up, ready to go\u201d came about at a South Carolina event.</p> <p>Michelle Obama also took the stage and reminisced about past campaign events in Iowa, including \u2013 apparently \u2013 once seeing her spouse\u2019s face carved out of butter. The First Lady spoke softly, despite a microphone, and was clearly feeling the magnitude of the moment. \u201cThis is an emotional time for us. This is the final event of my husband\u2019s final campaign,\u201d she said. She appealed to voters to remember the promise of four years ago, here in the state where it all began. \u201cHe stayed true to himself,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Rock star Bruce Springsteen had sought to warm up the chilly crowd and played songs with none-too-subtle titles like No Surrender and The Promised Land and Land of Hope and Dreams. But the mood overall \u2013 perhaps because of the low temperatures and late hour or just because it came at the end of a gruelling campaign \u2013 felt a little subdued, though undoubtedly cheerful. For a true moment of history it was somewhat reflexive with little wild or loud cheering from the large crowd.</p> <p>Obama himself sounded some of the old riffs from his 2008 campaign, appealing to Americans as a whole. \u201cWe fall and rise together as one people,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Then he touted his first term credentials, incuding the ending of the war in Afghanistan and Iraq and the killing of Osama bin Laden and rising home values. Then he appealed to Iowa voters to stick with him at tomorrow\u2019s ballot boxes. \u201cWe are not done yet on this journey. We have got more road to travel,\u201d he said. But it was not all positive, saying Mitt Romney wanted to take America backwards. \u201cafter all that we have fought through together we cannot give up on change now,\u201d Obama said.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-12e16bd8-16b9-4a91-a2bc-a96078f4723f\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/6/1352177559597/4dd97e9a-e937-4655-bb8a-5729897b0e65-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Barack Obama final rally in Iowa\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama speaks during his last rally in Des Moines, Iowa.

Even if he wins, Obama will not run for office again. This is it.</p> <p>The choice of Iowa seems political, sentimental and practical. Political because Iowa\u2019s six electoral college votes could really matter in a tight election. Iowa is a swing state and up for grabs and some serious presidential attention could be vital. Sentimental because this is the state were it all began way back in January 2008, when Obama beat Hillary Clinton in the caucus here, proving a black outsider could win over white voters with a powerful message of change. Practical because its near Chicago. Once this event is over then it is a short hop home to wait for the results.</p> <p>Certainly the crowds are showing up as thousands of people queued through the streets of downtown Des Moines, braving chilly air and a several-hour-long wait. Though their patience is almost certainly helped by the added attraction of a free Bruce Springsteen concert. You do not get to see The Boss that often in these parts. The event is happening in a knot of streets called the East Village (no relative to the New York neighbourhood). Already a drum band is playing as a large crowd packs into the area, stretching back to Des Moine's Capitol building.</p> <p>Shannon Minschall, a 41-year-old nursing home worker, scored seats in the front row thanks to his sister being the sign language interpreter for the evening. He was exceedingly positive about Obama\u2019s chances of winning the state. \u201cI think he will take it by at least four points,\u201d he said. \u201cConsidering the people he\u2019s had road blocking him in Congress for four years, I think he has done a good job.\u201d But Minschall did admit there was an enthusiasm gap among Democrats. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the same enthusiasm as last time but people will show up. They know it is too important,\u201d he added. But in the meantime there is history in the making: Obama\u2019s last rally.</p> <p>Which, makes this correspondent a little nostalgic. I was in the convention hall when Obama gave his 2004 speech in Boston. I went to a 2006 fundraiser at Conde Naste in Manhattan when he was mulling a run (and the mistaken conventional wisdom was he would not). Then came 2008 versus Hillary and after that, the battle versus John McCain and Sarah Palin and the Great Recession. Now it's 2012 and his last ever campaign rally. Even though Obama might have a second term ahead of him, it all shows how remarkably quickly American politics can work. It also makes me feel distressingly old.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-b53b6ebd-369a-4c02-b654-964919267f48\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/6/1352169049654/c07bab59-2c52-461b-9696-b44936526b40-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Barack Obama in Ohio\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama speaks to supporters in Columbus, Ohio, tonight.

A family man. But it is about job performance,\u201d Zaun said. That sounded fair enough for a Republican on election eve. But then Zaun spoiled it with the old canard that Obama has taken America on some sort of dangerous foreign tangent. \u201cIs there anyone here who would like to become a European nation?\u201d Zaun asked. \u201cNo!\u201d the crowd roared back. But, look, just this week it was announced the <a href=\"http://www.li.com/media/press-releases/2012-legatum-prosperity-index-american-dream-at-risk-in-key-election-year\">US has crashed out of the top ten of the world\u2019s most prosperous nations</a>.

Ryan, whose voice hinted at being hoarse after a punishing schedule in recent weeks, hit his usual notes of painting tomorrow\u2019s vote as generational in importance.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not just picking a president for four years. We are picking a path for our nation,\u201d he said. He talked about the economy and the need for change, painting the familiar picture of a broken country, high joblessness and mounting debts, both personal and national. \u201cWe can fix this,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Then he used a more recent attack line picking up on comments Obama made for supporters to vote out of \u201crevenge\u201d. The comment has been made into a radio ad already playing on Iowa airwaves. \u201cThat is not hope and change. That is not aspirational. That is not what we do in this country.

We've made serious mistakes as a country, sometimes dodging apocalypse or genocide by a combination of luck and sheer bloodymindedness. We've let our government take action in gruesome ways \u2013 internment camps, Vietnam, Iraq. And, as citizens, we've stood by while injustices rolled over other people's lives (this individualized list is too painful and too long to articulate).</p> <p>But we tend to learn from our mistakes; we tend to correct them, as best we can. Our always re-enforced self-interest and offhand sense of fairness produces a kind of lazy arc toward justice. Frustration and outrage bring wars to an end (\"We're still in Iraq? Why?\").

It is a time for volunteers ferrying and cajoling voters to the polling stations. So Romney is breaking the convention by continuing to campaign Tuesday in Pennsylvania and Ohio. His campaign staff has just announced that Paul Ryan too is to keep on going in Janesville, Wisconsin, his home state. No big hardship for him. Just in case he fails to make it as vice-president, he kept his name on the ballot for re-election to the House and a little campaign time in the state can't help.</p> </blockquote> <p>The move by Romney is not unprecedented. The <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/265953-romney-to-campaign-on-election-day-in-battlegrounds-ohio-pa\">Hill notes</a> that Obama visited Indiana in 2008 on Election Day, and President George W. Bush visited Ohio in 2004.

Minority, specifically black, voters have grown in their support of same-sex marriage since President Obama announced his backing for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/gay-marriage\">gay marriage</a> in May: it seems to be a rare example where the president's bully pulpit has actually worked.</p> </blockquote> <p>They're talking a lot about gay marriage in Maryland these days.

While he\u2019s here somebody whispers in the ear, you better go back home and protect your stock because God is sending judgment. The thing came through the area. You have to understand the season and the time.

  "<p>The American composer Elliott Carter, who has died aged 103, was, apart from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/sep/22/pierre-boulez-interview\" title=\"\">Pierre Boulez</a>, the last survivor of the heroic age of postwar musical modernism, and perhaps its greatest exponent. In the 1950s, when Carter wrote his first masterpieces in his new self-made, fabulously intricate language, that age was in full flood. By the time he wrote his playful late masterpieces, it had long since passed into history.</p> <p>And yet despite his longevity, Carter never became what so many aged artists become: relics of a bygone age, constantly interviewed for their memories of the past. He always lived in the present tense. In his last years he was more interested to hear about the latest thing than in reminiscing. By the same token, he and his music were completely impervious to fashion. The music lost its hectic intricacy of the 1970s and 80s and became so graceful in its modernist purism that it took on the mysterious quality of a classic \u2013 always contemporary, through being essentially timeless. In Carter's vicinity, musical history seemed to bend to his agenda; he was always the centre of his own self-made universe, needing no validation from anything or anyone.</p> <p>The achievement is all the more extraordinary when seen in the context of Carter's life story. Most composers' biographies bear out the adage that geniuses are born, not made. With Carter the reverse was true. There was no revelation in early childhood of unusual gifts, to be eagerly seized on by the world. What distinguishes Carter's early years is not precocious musicality but precocious maturity and unshakeable self-belief. He was born in New York, at a time when the first skyscrapers were appearing on the skyline, but milk was still delivered by horse and cart. His father was a lace importer and Elliott often accompanied his father on buying trips, which allowed him to learn French and Flemish at first hand.</p> <p>It was a solid bourgeois upbringing, but the boy soon showed a rebellious streak. His father hoped he would take over the business and must have been annoyed to find his son so passionate not just about music, but beastly modern music. The young Carter was incorrigibly attracted to anything new: he attended the first American performance of The Rite of Spring, in 1924. In the same year Carter met the reclusive founding father of American musical modernism, Charles Ives, thanks to a sympathetic music teacher at his school. Ives took to the determined young man, describing him in a letter of recommendation to Harvard University as \"rather an exceptional boy. He has an instinctive interest in literature, and especially music.\"</p> <p>At Harvard, Carter officially studied English literature, but he also learned ancient Greek, sang in the Harvard Glee Club (for which he later wrote three fine pieces) and wrote incidental music for theatre productions. These early works were competent, but gave no sign of exceptional promise. A career as a music critic (Carter early on revealed a sharp insightful mind and fluent style) or a humanities teacher (he taught for several years at St John's College, Annapolis, Maryland), combined with some composing for choirs on the side, seemed his most likely prospect. But Carter's persistent explorations and self-questioning suggest an inkling of a bigger goal.</p> <p>The next 15 years were ones of slow maturing, revealed in a trying-out of various idioms that to the world must have seemed oddly tentative. In retrospect, these years take on an awesome quality of self-possessed, unhurried progress toward a goal whose essence was glimpsed, but for which the technical means were as yet lacking. What Carter was searching for was a music apt for the giddy speed and multilayered experience of being alive in the 20th century. But he was aware that the obstreperous American modernism of Ives, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jul/03/obituaries.culture\" title=\"Henry Brant obituary\">Henry Brant</a> and Edgard Var\u00e8se wouldn't do.</p> <p>Urban and \"machine-age\" sounds and gestures did not interest him; they were too much of the moment. He wanted a modernism beyond fashion, rooted in a new kind of syntax, and to achieve that some European sophistication would be necessary. All the things he had absorbed would eventually find a place in his modernist idiom: the idea of dramatic personages found in Mozart operas, the independent layers of English madrigals, the syntactic rigour of Arnold Schoenberg \u2013 and the combination of strict and free rhythm in jazz pianists he admired, such as Art Tatum.</p> <p>Synthesising all these within a coherent idiom that was both authentically contemporary and authentically American \u2013 but without obvious American pictorialisms \u2013 would prove agonisingly hard. At first Carter thought it might be achieved through the pert, lean, unsentimental neoclassical idiom then in fashion. From 1932 he spent three years in Paris acquiring a solid technical grounding from neo-classicism's leading proselyte, Nadia Boulanger, which left its mark on his String Quartet in C (and possibly other works from that period that Carter later destroyed).</p> <p>Once back in America, Carter became the musical director for Lincoln Kirstein's Ballet Caravan, for which he composed the ballet Pocahontas, and in 1939 he married the sculptor Helen Frost-Jones. Like his slightly older contemporary Aaron Copland, Carter was swept up in the populist spirit engendered by the Depression. One result was his Holiday Overture, composed in 1944 during a summer stay on Fire Island.</p> <p>Copland was a guest during that summer and his ballet Appalachian Spring was written at the same kitchen table as Carter's overture. Copland's ballet was a perfect piece of American arcadiana, which touched something deep in the American psyche. Carter's overture, though sharing some of Copland's upbeat diatonic flavour, had an admixture of Carter-ish contrapuntal complexity and dissonance. His inability, or refusal, to strike a purely populist note helps to explain why, with his 40th birthday looming, he was still a marginal figure. When Copland published a survey of \"younger talents to watch\", in 1948, Carter did not get a mention, a fact which \u2013 despite his affection for Copland \u2013 still rankled in later years.</p> <p>Eventually Carter realised that all the accumulated baggage of his music \u2013 the neoclassicism, the madrigalian references, the Greek texts, the Americana \u2013 would have to go. In the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCS7cNoq8pk\" title=\"YouTube: Piano Sonata, first movement\">Piano Sonata</a> of 1945, written the year he moved with his wife into the brownstone apartment he would live in for the rest of his life, Carter retains the massive rhetoric of the American sublime. But the cyclic form, the startling use of piano resonances and rhythmic flexibility mark a huge step forward. The <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqpbfxiVieQ\" title=\"YouTube: Cello Sonata, first movement\">Cello Sonata</a> of 1948 is another leap towards a really radical conception of form. The piece at the end seems to loop back to its opening, in a way that recalls St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9's conception of a book that one can begin at any point. At the beginning, a strict metronomic \"ticking\" in the piano is combined with a rhapsodically unfolding line in the cello. Nothing quite like this joining of two radically opposed worlds moving at different speeds had been heard in music before.</p> <p>But it was in the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apc-Fw0r2tI\" title=\"YouTube: First String Quartet, first movement\">First String Quartet</a> of 1951 that Carter's new conception of independent musical layers, sometimes co-operating, sometimes clashing in purposeful disunity, came fully into focus. To achieve it, Carter cut himself off from his usual surroundings and moved to the Arizona desert for several months. What survives from his old manner is a heroic rhetoric of wide intervals, as if the American sublime has been sublimated and purged of anything local.</p> <p>That joining together of aspiring strenuousness with an ever-increasing allusiveness would define Carter's creative project for the next two decades. It revealed itself in three works of astounding complexity that occupied him for more than 10 years: the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1y59x_I_IU\" title=\"YouTube: Double Concerto\">Double Concerto</a>, premiered in 1961, the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AraF1IQouOE&amp;feature=related\" title=\"YouTube: Piano Concerto, first movement\">Piano Concerto</a> \u2013 written in 1964-65, partly in Berlin, and imbued, according to the composer, with the dark atmosphere of that divided city \u2013 and the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xa8vupkPfMk&amp;feature=related\" title=\"YouTube: Concerto for Orchestra\">Concerto for Orchestra</a> of 1969.</p> <p>Carter was now in his 60s, and his life had long since settled into a pattern that mingled teaching and composing during the academic year with more concentrated creative work during summer retreats at the Carters' modest country home at Waccabuc in upstate New York. He had reached the age at which Brahms was already thinking of retirement, and most composers are in some way retrenching.</p> <p>Nobody could have guessed that Carter was just getting into his stride, and that ahead of him lay more than four decades of creativity. In the 1970s, after a gap of nearly 30 years, he returned to vocal writing in a series of elegantly intricate settings of American poets such as John Ashbery, Robert Lowell and Elizabeth Bishop. This decade also produced the distilled essence of Carter's heroic style: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEbIXsMqlM4&amp;feature=player_embedded\" title=\"YouTube: A Symphony of Three Orchestras\">A Symphony of Three Orchestras</a> (1977). Inspired by Hart Crane's poem The Bridge, the piece evokes all the conflicting energies of America, with a soaring trumpet solo that captures Crane's image of a gull wheeling over Brooklyn Bridge. By the 1980s, Carter was established as modernism's not-so-grand old man. This didn't cut much ice with the American public, which preferred an expressive form of post-minimalism (and still does).</p> <p>He was not ignored in America, but it was the respectful esteem of prizes and fellowships that came his way rather than affection. As ever, Carter was a frequent visitor to Europe, where his uncompromising modernism found a warmer reception. He was never a performer, apart from a few teenage piano recitals, so one form of \"visibility\" was denied him. However, he was an indefatigable worker and was much involved in practical ways with American musical life. He taught, principally at the Juilliard School, in New York, held guest professorships in the US and in Europe and served on the board of the American section of the International Society for Contemporary Music.</p> <p>Up to the 1970s, Carter had been a severely constructivist composer. Some pieces were based on vast polymetric grids, and all of them involved complex rhythmic gear-changes known as metric modulations. Carter also made use of a highly systematised harmonic system, involving tables of all possible permutations of a given set of intervals. Manipulating these systems involved immense labour and copious sheaves of preliminary sketches (well over a thousand pages for A Symphony of Three Orchestras).</p> <p>But from the 80s Carter increasingly composed free-style, by ear. This is one reason for his astonishingly increased productivity. Another is that the knotted density of his 60s and 70s scores gave way to a new transparency \u2013 though the musical thought is more quicksilver than ever (\"When will Carter start to write an old man's music?\" was the plaintive overheard comment of a composer several decades his junior, but already senior himself.) A stream of chamber miniatures emerged, as well as balletically elegant concertos. The greatest surprise of Carter's later years was the appearance of an opera, What Next?, first performed in 1998. However, not all the late works were light in tone. Symphonia, premiered in 1996, is his weightiest achievement, with a middle movement, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctvbYJGcQus\" title=\"YouTube: Adagio Tenebroso\">Adagio Tenebroso</a>, that is the most perfect example of Carter's desolate, unfathomably dark slow movements.</p> <p>In the 1990s, America seemed to wake up to the fact that the most revered living composer on the planet was one of their own. As if to make up for lost time, a stream of home-grown commissions followed. There were more surprises, including a piece composed in 2007 for string orchestra, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyrAVD9S2TI\" title=\"YouTube: Sound Fields\">Sound Fields</a>, of astonishing simplicity. This aloof procession of slow chords comes close to Morton Feldman, a composer often thought of as Carter's opposite. When this was pointed out to him, he said, \"I know\", with a naughty twinkle. \"When you get to my age\", he said, \"you just want to have fun.\"</p> <p>Despite the death of his wife in 2003, Carter's cheerful spirit seemed undimmed. He continued to travel across the Atlantic for performances of his music, although these trips brought on pneumonia more than once.

To the end one could detect a determined set of the jaw, which was already evident in photographs of the young student. And there is sometimes a surprisingly aggressive tone in his letters. These clues point to the inevitable human cost of such an implacable struggle sustained over so many years, which perhaps only those closest to Carter had to bear. For the rest of the world, Carter offers an inspiring image of the heights to which determined creative self-fashioning can rise, and a body of work that in its total integrity, masterly craftsmanship and many-sided expressive power, already deserves the name of classic.</p> <p>Carter is survived by his son, David, and a grandson.</p> <p><em> </em>\u2022 Elliott Cook Carter, composer, born 11 December 1908; died 5 November 2012</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 6 November.

  "<p>Hopes the economy is on the road to recovery have been dampened by figures showing retail sales stalled last month and growth in Britain's services sector almost ground to a standstill.</p> <p>Britons shied away from spending on big-ticket and luxury items in October, leading to the weakest sales growth in almost a year, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC). Meanwhile, expansion in the UK's services sector \u2013 which accounts for three-quarters of UK GDP \u2013 slowed to a crawl as new business failed to make up for projects completed during the month.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/25/uk-emerges-from-double-dip-recession-george-osborne\" title=\"\">Chancellor George Osborne had seized on news last month that the economy emerged from double-dip recession</a>, growing by 1% in the third quarter of 2012, as evidence that his policies had put Britain \"on the right track\". But early signs for the fourth quarter now suggest the economy could shrink again, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2012/oct/31/triple-dip-recession-brace-yourself\" title=\"\">raising the prospect of a triple-dip recession</a>.</p> <p>Rob Wood, an analyst at Berenberg Bank, said: \"With manufacturing output suffering from weak exports and domestic demand, and the service sector flirting with contraction, a fall in GDP in the fourth quarter now looks most likely.\"</p> <p>The BRC said like-for-like sales fell 0.1% last month, compared with October last year. It was a crushing blow after September's figures, which showed growth of 1.5%, had raised hopes Britons had got used to austerity and were out spending again. Averaged out over the past three months, like-for-like sales growth was only 0.4% a month \u2013 the worst in 11 months.</p> <p>Stephen Robertson, director general of the BRC, said: \"Unfortunately it looks like the modest sales revival we saw in September was something of a false dawn. The disappointing figures are a reminder of the difficult economic realities many are still facing. Falling consumer confidence means people are limiting spending to essential items and are cautious about committing to big-ticket and discretionary buying.\"</p> <p>Rising prices helped drive total food sales up by an average of 3.4% but, stripping out the impact of inflation, volumes of food sales were stagnant. The worst hit sector was home accessories, which the BRC said was not considered an essential \"for the consumer with little spare money\".</p> <p>Household spending overall dropped by almost 3% in October, according to Visa. Steve Perry, commercial director at Visa Europe, said: \"The strong growth witnessed in recent months went into decline. October's figures will take some of the gloss off recent optimism as they are a timely reminder that household finances remain under pressure and consumers are exercising caution.\"</p> <p>A forward-looking survey of the services sector suggests this sluggish growth is likely to continue in the fourth quarter. The Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index for the services sector dropped to 50.6 last month from 52.2 in September, only just above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. It is the slowest pace of growth in almost two years and significantly below analyst expectations of a much smaller decline to 52.</p> <p>Andrew Harker, economist at Markit, said: \"Although there are signs of improvements, [companies surveyed] still referred to the fragility of both demand and confidence among clients. The expectation among firms is for activity to improve over the coming year, but the road to full economic recovery still looks to be a long one.\"</p> <p>The gloomy survey is likely to reignite the debate over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/04/bank-brushes-calls-to-pump-funds-into-economy\" title=\"\">whether the Bank of England will expand its quantitative easing programme this week</a>. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said: \"While we just about still lean towards the view that the Bank of England will hold off from more QE for now and monitor how the economy is developing and what impact the Funding for Lending Scheme is having, it is looking an extremely tight call.\"</p> <p>While new orders in the services sector grew in October \u2013 largely due to overseas demand \u2013 they did so at a slower pace than in September and companies said incoming new business did not make up for the completion of existing projects.</p> <p>For the second month running, employers in the services sector cut jobs in October. Business costs rose but companies were reluctant to pass them on to customers as a result of strong competition. Companies did, however, remain relatively optimistic, with 42% of those surveyed forecasting that service sector activity will improve over the next 12 months.</p>"
