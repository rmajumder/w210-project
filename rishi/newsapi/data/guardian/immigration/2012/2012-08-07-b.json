  "<p>Brazil have never won Olympic gold, a failing that pains a proud football nation and has prompted the team's coach, Mano Menezes, to label this tournament \"The London Project\", but a glorious chance to break new ground awaits at Wembley on Saturday having swept aside South Korea in the semi-final.</p> <p>Menezes' side, inspired by the mesmerising Neymar, the polished Oscar and the potent Leandro Dami\u00e3o, cruised into Saturday's final against Mexico \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/07/mexico-beat-japan-olympic-semi?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">3-1 victors over Japan</a> \u2013 with a performance that doubled as an emphatic riposte to accusations in the Brazilian media of not taking the Olympics seriously enough. Angered, they cancelled an open training session for on the eve of the semi-final. They also punished South Korea by taking their goal tally to 15 in five matches and demonstrated they possess the pedigree to improve on the silver medals from Los Angeles in 1984 and Seoul in 1988.</p> <p>\"It is 24 years since Brazil were last in the Olympic final and that shows it is not easy to get there,\" Menezes said. \"We have always had quality players but we have also faced a lot of quality and it shows the merits of this team that it has reached the final. But it is only the final. There is one more step to go.\"</p> <p>Brazil arrived in the semi-final with a 100% record and their forward line gelling perfectly, justification for taking umbrage to criticism back home, but South Korea were not initially overawed by their opponents or the occasion. They took the game to the favourites, a decision justified by a vulnerable Brazilian defence and the movement of the Korean front pair of Ji Dong-won and Kim Hyun-sung, and should have led before Neymar, Oscar and Leandro found their imperious rhythm.</p> <p>Kim Hyun-sung had a back-post header hacked clear by Sandro after a fine turn in the area by Nam Tae-hee and was put through by a lovely chip from Ji. A brave header beyond the Brazil goalkeeper, Gabriel, lacked the pace to cross the line and prompted an equally courageous effort by the Sunderland striker only for Thiago Silva to intervene. Ji began impressively and was close to finding the top corner with an audacious drive from 35 yards. Once Brazil had withstood the early pressure, however, they took complete control and South Korea wilted before the quality of the opposition attack. \"We blew the early chances and we tired,\" said their coach Hong Myung Bo, his side having played 120 minutes against Team GB on Saturday.</p> <p>Oscar, Chelsea's new \u00a325m recruit, has shown a fine understanding with Neymar throughout the tournament and the pair were involved in the majority of the chances that fell to Brazil from midway through the first half onwards. Leandro twice went close before Neymar found Oscar and, after an unchallenged run across the Korean area, he rolled a perfectly weighted pass into Romulo, who beat Lee Bum-young inside his near post too easily. In fairness to the keeper, he had injured a knee moments earlier when colliding with Leandro to block a poor back-pass.</p> <p>Ji shot inches over from another ambitious attempt on the stroke of half-time but there was no concerted response from South Korea and the tie was effectively ended when Leandro doubled Brazil's lead early in the second half. Neymar was the architect, playing an incisive one-two with Marcelo into the area, and though Brazil's left-back missed the cut-back it fell invitingly for the unmarked striker to tuck away.</p> <p>Leandro's second, Brazil's third, was a clinical touch of improvisation into the bottom corner after Oscar and Neymar, of course, had weaved their way through the Korean defence once more. They ultimately progressed to Wembley with a stroll.</p>",

  "<p>So Stuart Jeffries, in a dig at Britain in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/aug/03/london-2012-olympics-blubbing-emotion?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">his summary of the Olympic Games</a> (4 August), has become accustomed \u2026 to loathing this \u2026 country \u2013 its meanness, racism, imperial shame \u2026 mediocre royals\". Why does he stay if he hates us so? The racism jibe is particularly hurtful \u2013 and s urely, in its generalisation, racist itself. True, there'll always be the ignorant and abusive, but from living on the multicultural east side of London, I know that for every bigot there are others who celebrate and champion diversity and equality, and many more who, quite frankly, aren't that bothered one way or another. How else to explain, despite nearly 70 years of mass immigration, the lack of race riots, supremacist paramilitary organisations, deliberate ethnic or religious ghettoisation (class is another matter), discriminatory legislation, segregated services, or widespread and persistent support for fascist parties?</p> <p>As for imperial shame, I know of no one who now thinks empire was a good thing. Many of my acquaintances whose families came from ex-colonies bear no ill will towards the British empire. Nor do they see this country as mean, racist, imperialist or backward-looking, but as a place of opportunity. Many even adore the royal family (though I'm on Stuart Jeffries's side on that one). I'm no flag-waving little Englander, or Tory supporter. I just find it odd that so many of those on the left have ended up, in Jeffries's words, loathing this country \u2013 or rather, many of its people. <br><strong>Karen Lane</strong><br><em>Ilford, Essex</em></p> <p>\u2022 Not rivers of blood, but rivers of gold (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/06/london-2012-british-racial-attitudes?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Hugh Muir</a>, 7 August)<br><strong>Tony Hirst</strong><br><em>Darwen, Lancashire</em></p>",
  "<p>For most of my childhood in London people were confused by me. They would look at me askance and ask, \"Are you Pakistani or Jamaican?\" \"I'm from Somalia,\" I would reply irritably, receiving a blank look before the inevitable response: \"Where's that, then?\"</p> <p>After Mo Farah's glorious Olympics victory on Saturday night I hope I won't have to be asked that again.</p> <p>Much has been written about how Britain's Jamaican community celebrated Usain Bolt's charge to gold. But British Somalis, who have been here in numbers for over two decades, are not so firmly placed in the national consciousness. And often when we are written about it is with the worst connotations: violence, terrorism, gangs. Farah, the journalist Rageh Omar and the rapper <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/feb/28/knaan-interview\" title=\"\">K'naan</a> go some way in creating a positive image, but young Somalis' sense of identity seems more powerfully formed by the persistently negative representations found in the media.</p> <p>Five years ago I tutored children in London, aged eight to 14, and asked what made them proud of their heritage. They struggled to answer. They knew little more about the history of Somalia than my English classmates. Some of them had been born in Somalia, others in the Gulf, others had spent time in refugee centres in Norway, and despite holding closely to their Somaliness \u2013 the language, the family networks, the food \u2013 it was almost like a tatty old blanket they found comfort in but that had no intrinsic value. As they got older, they either preferred to identify with a wider black culture or put Islam at the centre of their lives and identity. Somali culture seemed parochial, uncool, too much about clans and conflict to warrant their attention. It was almost as if the ambivalent place in the world that Somalia held \u2013 a state only in name, a stretch of Africa heavily influenced by Asia \u2013 was reflected in the confusion these children experienced.</p> <p>Looking at the statistics surrounding Somalis it is easy to despair \u2013 at the unemployment and poverty rates, educational underachievement and criminal overachievement \u2013 but it is not a picture I recognise. The world I know is much more complicated: a family of six might share a two-bedroom council flat, but the children are hot-housed, studying the Qur'an two nights a week and Kumon maths at weekends.</p> <p>A single mother might not buy a car because she is saving up to build a house in Mogadishu or Hargeisa for her eventual return. A young man in a baseball cap working nightshifts in a warehouse or supermarket might be the breadwinner for his family here and in Somalia. After 20 years in the UK the Somali community is still in flux; walking down Uxbridge Road in west London, you pass successful Somali restaurants, internet cafes and money-transfer companies; while Camden Town at night reveals young Somalis in handcuffs being led into police vans. Sometimes nuclear families show the divide, with one sibling at university and the other in Feltham.</p> <p>While Jamaican, Nigerian and other black communities have put down roots in Britain, sending MPs to parliament and joining professions, Somalis have been nomads on a global scale \u2013 arriving and then leaving in ever greater numbers over the past 150 years. The <a href=\"http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/somalia.htm\" title=\"\">civil war of the late 80s and early 90s</a> saw the largest influx, and for many Somalis Britain was a temporary home, a place to shelter from the storm. Despite occasional \u2013 sometimes antagonistic \u2013 interactions with other black communities, they have remained largely separate, maybe divided by the growth of evangelical forms of Christianity and Islam in migrant areas, each group seeing the other as too new, too foreign and too troublesome.</p> <p>As the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/gallery/2012/jul/20/life-mogadishu-somalia-in-pictures#/?picture=392882363&amp;index=1\" title=\"\">political situation that drove Somalis to Britain improves</a>, there is now the opportunity for return, and some are drifting back to their homeland, rebuilding interrupted lives. What part of Britain they take back with them remains to be seen. Will it be a strict stratification between classes? Will they build a welfare system? Will they reject or embrace the freedoms they enjoyed here? Will the children grow up missing Britain the way I missed Somalia?</p> <p>For those who decide to remain, a new relationship to this country is developing; a sense of curiosity replacing the insularity that has grown over the past 20 years. As second- and third-generation British Somalis put down roots, a community that has been ignored since the first Somali sailors sailed up the Thames will begin to demand attention.</p> <p><em>Nadifa Mohamed is author of Black Mamba Boy</em></p>",
  "<p>High above London at Alexandra Palace, the floodlights of the Olympic Stadium are just a blur on the horizon, and sporting discipline could not be further from anyone's mind. As the B-52s blast from the stereo the bar is heaving and the air is thick with the smell of beer and savoury Dutch snacks.</p> <p>For Gertjan van Holland, a research consultant wearing an orange suit that he ordered online and a cowboy hat with orange tinsel, it is the perfect way to celebrate visiting London.</p> <p>\"The Holland Heineken House is very famous in Holland so if you're at the Olympics you have to experience it,\" he says, as the Dutch swimming champion Ranomi Kromowidjojo takes part in a live television broadcast to whoops and cheers. \"It's the big party.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.alexandrapalace.com/whats-on/holland-heineken-house/\" title=\"\">Holland Heineken House</a>, which started as a tent in Barcelona in 1992 and has grown to become one of the biggest draws on the Olympic party circuit, prides itself on being the most boisterous of <a href=\"http://www.visitlondon.com/london2012/national-hospitality-houses-for-london-2012/\" title=\"\">dozens of national hospitality houses</a> set up at London landmarks for the duration of the Games.</p> <p>The centres, mostly established by individual countries' national Olympic committees (NOCs), are designed to showcase those countries and provide a base for the visiting teams.</p> <p>But there is a world of difference between Ireland's <a href=\"http://www.visitlondon.com/events/detail/26053370-irish-olympic-house-at-the-big-chill-house\" title=\"\">low-key hangout</a> in a north London pub and Brazil's contemporary art at Somerset House, or, for instance, the hi-tech branding exercise that is the Sochi 2014 pavilion and the laid back charm of Africa Village.</p> <p>\"With 45 houses there is something for everyone. The majority are free and the majority are public,\" says Zanine Adams, of the promotional organisation London &amp; Partners, which played a loose co-ordinating role in creating the centres, and helping NOCs find venues and link to London events organisers. \"So, if you are coming to London as a visitor you can go to the French house and sit down, have a glass of wine, and chat perhaps to someone from the energy firm EDF, or you could go to the German fan-fest and support the team.\" The houses are an opportunity, she adds, for London-based expatriates to support their team among fellow nationals.</p> <p>With an estimated 125,000 Dutch people living in Britain this is certainly the case with the raucous Holland HQ, which has 6,500 tickets on offer a day and has been sold out most evenings since opening nearly a fortnight ago.</p> <p>Standing at one of several bars in an orange shirt and top hat, Peter-Paul Kimman, a commodities trader who has lived in London for 13 years, is delighted he has managed to bring his son and their friends to this Dutch party. \"I want to show people what orange people are like when they go crazy!\" he says. His son, Laurent, seems convinced. \"Not many people like to wear orange,\" he admits, \"but it's for the country.\"</p> <p>The diaspora factor is particularly strong for <a href=\"http://www.visitlondon.com/events/detail/26053374-jamaica-house-at-the-o2-north-greenwich-arena\" title=\"\">Jamaica House</a> at the O2, which erupted in celebration for Usain Bolt on Sunday night; and for <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/in-pictures-19092353\" title=\"\">Africa Village</a>, the first attempt by the Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa to create a unified hospitality centre from the 53 African NOCs \u2013 which, says spokesman Laurent Bagnis, might not necessarily have had the means to create their own houses.</p> <p>Located in Kensington Gardens just across from the Royal Albert Hall, Africa Village offers an eclectic insight into the continent's culture: there is Ethiopian coffee, Arabic calligraphy, Botswanan food and the tent of Equatorial Guinea showing pictures of Obiang Nguema, the president in power since 1979.</p> <p>Some countries, such as Georgia, decided to eschew the limelight , keeping keep their NOC houses private and accessible only to delegates and special invitees.</p> <p>Others, such as Serbia, have kept the proceedings within their own embassies, thereby minimising cost. The USA House, in the Royal College of Art, operates on a high-security, invitation-only basis for anyone not an athlete, sponsor, official or staff member of the US team. Members of the public are able to access a shop, providing they are US citizens and have ID to prove it.</p> <p>For others, this mentality would miss the point entirely: their houses are the perfect platform from which to sell themselves and their Games to come.</p> <p>The massive <a href=\"http://www.visitlondon.com/events/detail/26053348-russia-sochi-park-at-kensington-gardens\" title=\"\">Sochi.Park pavilion</a> in Kensington Gardens is a paean \u2013 complete with ice rink \u2013 to the Black Sea host city of the next winter Olympics, while the sophisticated <a href=\"http://www.visitlondon.com/events/detail/25374566-casa-brasil-at-somerset-house\" title=\"\">Casa Brasil</a> endeavours to use London 2012 as a publicity platform for Rio 2016.</p> <p>Sabrina Costa, a visitor from the north-east state of Pernambuco, says she is glad Brazil's house has more than the usual cliches. \"This is the image that Brazilians want to show the world,\" she says. \"Now we are the fifth economy in the world, and we have so many things to show.\"</p> <p>Qatar, a country with huge oil wealth and geopolitical ambitions, has also used <a href=\"http://www.visitlondon.com/events/detail/26312118-bayt-qatar-qatar-house\" title=\"\">its HQ</a> at Savoy Place to set out its vision for the future; it is planning to bid for the 2024 Games.</p> <p>With these aims in mind, it is perhaps unsurprising that many NOCs have been anything but stingy with their hospitality houses, scrapping over prestigious venues such as Somerset House and giving the London events industry a huge cash injection. Adams estimates that the 20 to 25 houses that London &amp; Partners directly helped create, generated about \u00a390m in economic benefits alone.</p> <p>Jeremy King, editor of Event Magazine, says: \"The big Olympics houses \u2013 Old Billingsgate market [rented as Club France] or Somerset House \u2013 some of these venues are being hired out for almost \u00a31m for three or four weeks, and that's probably between 25% and 50% of their normal annual event turnover.</p> <p>\"So it's very, very, lucrative. It's huge for the events industry. Normally that's dead space; there're usually hardly any events that take place in that time, because people are away, schools are out.\"</p>",
  "<p>My first reaction was confusion, then panic. Everything had been going to plan: my brother Alistair and I were going full pelt in a five-man breakaway group on the bike, trying to take the race away from most of our rivals, when I saw a penalty board.</p> <p>My first thought was: \"Oh, No 31 \u2013 Alistair's got a penalty, what an idiot.\" Then I looked at my left arm and my right. The evidence was right there in front of me: I was 31.</p> <p>I had never got a time penalty in a triathlon race before, and my mind was in overdrive. I haven't seen the replays yet, but I've been told my foot was on the line when I got on my bike in transition. Either way, there was nothing I could do about it. It's not like you can appeal to an official when you're going 30 miles an hour.</p> <p>Alistair was brilliant though. There were only 15 seconds a lap on the bike where we could hear each other. He didn't realise I'd incurred a penalty, but when I told him, his first response was: \"Calm down. You can still do this.\"</p> <p>All sorts of calculations were going through my mind. OK, so I'm going to lose 15 seconds. What's that in terms of metres? Roughly 90m. OK. And I beat Javier Gomez in Kitzbuhel by over 30 seconds, so yes, Alistair is right, I can do this. I've just to run harder and faster than I've ever done before.</p> <p>I was helped enormously by the biggest, noisiest and most raucous crowd I've ever raced in front of. They were amazing. They kept shouting \"Go Alistair\" or \"Go Jonny\". I was thinking: I'm trying, I'm trying!</p> <p>Alistair really pushed it on the run. Afterwards, we found out he did the first 2.5km at 28-minutes-for-10,000m pace, straight off the bike when your legs are feeling wobbly. When you think that Mo Farah ran 27m 30sec to win the men's 10,000m on Saturday, you realise that we were going some.</p> <p>The British coaches had told me to take my penalty at the end of the first lap of the run but I was in a breakaway group so I thought I'd wait. When it got to the third lap I was tiring so I thought I'd better take it. I quite appreciated the rest.</p> <p>Would I have beaten Javier Gomez to the silver medal without the penalty? I don't think so. Even though the gap at the end was only 20 seconds, he looked strong throughout. But it will always be at the back of my mind.</p> <p>After the finish, I started to feel worse. I was hot already, but then they took us to a tent to get us ready for the presentation which was like an oven. After about 10 minutes I collapsed. I'm not sure if I passed out or not, but I was certainly woozy. Then I was sick. A doctor came but it took a while and I was feeling awful. She felt my head and said: \"You're really hot, you need to lie down immediately.\"</p> <p>She then covered me in ice and wet towels to bring my temperature down. They then put me on a wheelchair, which I wasn't sure I needed, and took me to the medical room where they tested my blood pressure, heart rate and temperature and I was given glucose and water. After 20 minutes of having the ice on me, my temperature was exactly 38c, nothing really to worry about. It's super serious when it's over 40c. But I soon recovered and thankfully was declared well enough to collect my medal.</p> <p>Being on the podium was fantastic and thrilling. But to be honest, I wasn't sure what to do. Should I smile? Should I sing? I did try a few words of the national anthem but I'm not someone who shows much emotion on the outside. But inside I was trying to absorb everything \u2013 the cheering crowds, the anthem, the sight of two British flags rising into the London sky. My internal monologue, though, was not much more than: wow, wow, wow, wow!</p> <p>The strange thing about the race was how I didn't feel nervous at all.</p> <p>This was the biggest race of my life, and normally beforehand I'm adjusting my kit and checking everything about five times to make sure everything is in place. I was almost expecting the Olympics to be the biggest thing ever, but it wasn't. It was just another race. I was more excited than nervous, and proud to be part of a team with Alistair and Stuart Hayes, who did a brilliant job on the bike \u2013 maintaining a high pace and protecting us from attacks.</p> <p>How I'm going to celebrate? We only got to London on Saturday and we've been staying in Hyde Park so we've not experienced the village yet. But that will change. I'm also going to watch some races, and take it easy for a few days. But in two and a half weeks I'll be back on the treadmill with a world series race in Stockholm.</p> <p>As for long-term ambitions, I'm moving out of Alistair's house and into my own place soon. And, longer term, I'm definitely looking at Rio 2016 if I still love the sport and all the training. I'll only be 26 then so hopefully I'll be in my prime. Who knows, maybe I can give Alistair a run for his money.</p>",
  "<p>Do not adjust your medal table: this really is happening. Beleaguered by security blather, troubled at times by its own unfathomable ticket regime, the London 2012 Olympic Games has now delivered gloriously and unanswerably where it really matters.</p> <p>Gold medals on Tuesday afternoon in triathlon, dressage and \u2013 you again? \u2013 cycling, took Britain's medal table tally decisively past the 19 golds achieved in Beijing four years ago. It is the best British gold medal tally at any Olympics since London's White City Games in 1908, when deer shooting and the tug of war were among the medals on offer. To give a more telling perspective on a vertiginous achievement, as recently as the 1996 Atlanta Games, Britain won just a single gold \u2013 in rowing.</p> <p>After a weekend of giddily received track and field success, the start of the Games' final week had already brought a reprise of that rather disorientating golden glow. Monday's equine and cycle-based exploits had left the gold tally just one short of Beijing's intoxicatingly grand haul overnight. Such are Team GB's current riches that the card for Tuesday's Olympic competition almost felt like a race within a race, a sprint for the wire to claim that historic 20th gold medal.</p> <p>In the event it was the triathlete <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/07/london-2012-brownlees-triathlon-success\" title=\"\">Alistair Brownlee who won the gold that equalled the modern record</a>, taking first place in Hyde Park ahead of his brother Johnny. It was a fitting triumph at these Games, an event staged in the heart of London in front of 200,000 ticketed and unticketed spectators, and taking in one of the few open active green spaces in the heart of this cramped and burdened, but still seethingly sport-centric city. Brownlee's was a hugely popular 19th gold after an awesome display of endurance athletics by the 24-year-old Yorkshireman. Despite slowing slightly to bask in the applause his time for the 10,000 metres was just 80 seconds down on Mo Farah's gold-medal winning effort in Stratford on Saturday. Mind you, Brownlee had just swum 1500m and cycled a marathon.</p> <p>And then all eyes turned to the Velodrome at the Olympic Park, that gorgeous piece of urban sporting design with its flipped-pancake roof and alluring coil of lacquered pine track. It is the most striking emblem of the reinvigoration of British Olympic sport. With newly enthroned two-wheel royalty Sir Chris Hoy and Victoria Pendleton both in action in the afternoon there would surely be no more fitting stage for the cracking of the 20-gold barrier.</p> <p>Except it didn't turn out like that. Instead, three miles south in the shadow of the Queen's house in Greenwich Park it was the British dressage team who surged through to take the decisive gold. There are those who will suggest dressage, an affair of immaculately top-hatted sideways galloping, might not represent the most fitting symbol of an Olympic sporting legacy. They might perhaps even opine that the likelihood that the streets of Britain will now be thronged with boys and girls parading their show-horses up and down the kerbs until teatime is remote. But this was a genuinely fine achievement, a first ever gold in this most exacting of horse-based disciplines.</p> <p>It is a common misconception that equine sports are only for the posh, the landed and the horsey, but many of the best riders are everyday people. The gold-winning dressage team featured the daughter of a German billionaire, a former farmhand from Sark and a woman from Enfield. Greenwich has been perhaps the most picturesque venue at these Olympics, a park designed for Henry VIII to hunt deer. There was a sense of jubilee-ish pageantry to the celebrations afterwards, with Princess Anne, who really does seem to have been lucky with her ticket application at these Games, leading the cheers.</p> <p>It was then time for the astonishingly accomplished British cycling team to begin putting clear water between London 2012 and the best efforts of four years ago. By 5.40pm there was a 21st rendition of the new dual national anthem - God Save The Queen followed by David Bowie's impossibly moving Heroes \u2013 at the Velodrome as Laura Trott won gold in the Omnium. This was a brilliantly nerveless victory for Trott, who beat the American Sarah Hammer in the final pursuit, a hugely popular second gold in London for the 20-year-old from Essex, who was born with a collapsed lung, later diagnosed with asthma, and who took up cycling on the advice of her doctor.</p> <p>Once again the world had turned a peculiar shade of British gold, the texture of Olympic sport so bizarrely altered at these Games that it was almost a shock when Victoria Pendleton was beaten by Australia's Anna Meares in the final of the women's sprint shortly after Trott's medal ceremony. Pendleton was consigned to taking a silver medal in the final race of her career. As she bowed in tears to all sides of the Velodrome there was, however, the consolation of departing as arguably the greatest British sportswoman ever, with her swag-bag of nine world championships and two Olympic gold medals.</p> <p>The obvious question, as Britain's sports fans peer, replete, down the Olympic medal table, waving to the lowly powerhouses of Germany and Australia, is how exactly did all this happen? As ever, the main reason is money, combined with a perfect storm of youthful talent in the right disciplines. It is no coincidence that improvement began almost immediately after Lottery funding was first introduced into Olympic sport a year after the single-gold Olympics of Atlanta. At the Sydney Games in 2000 Britain won 11 golds, as they did again in Athens in 2004. Then came Beijing, on the back of \u00a3235m investment in infrastructure and training over a four-year cycle.</p> <p>The numbers have been similar here. Combined with the stunning results of London 2012 it amounts to a very public triumph of funding, management and performance. For now the vexatious issues of legacy and the continuing sale of school sports fields can wait just a little bit. It has, after seven years of rather fraught Olympic preparation, been an extraordinarily golden six days.</p>",
  "<p>Greek authorities have begun one of the country's biggest crackdowns yet on suspected illegal immigrants, deploying 4,500 police around Athens and detaining more than 7,000 immigrants in less than 72 hours.</p> <p>Most have been released, but about 2,000, mostly Africans and Asians, were arrested. They were sent to holding centres pending deportation in an operation that officials, bizarrely, elected to call Xenios Zeus after the Greek god of hospitality.</p> <p>On Sunday, 88 undocumented Pakistanis were put on planes, accompanied by guards, back to their home country.</p> <p>\"We will not allow our towns, or our country, to be occupied and become a migrant ghetto,\" said Athens' hardline public-order minister, Nikos Dendias, as authorities discussed plans to build eight detention centres capable of holding up to 10,000 immigrants, in the capital.</p> <p>Widely seen as the easiest entry point to the west, Greece has had a surge of new arrivals, with government figures showing more than 100 migrants daily crossing the country's porous border with Turkey. The majority go to Athens, a magnet for migrants desperate to find work before moving on to other parts of Europe. An estimated million immigrants are believed to live in Greece where the population is barely 11 million.</p> <p>But the country's economic crisis and growing political radicalisation has given rise to a xenophobic backlash, the uncontrolled influx blamed for a sharp spike in violent crime.</p> <p>The neo-Nazi party Golden Dawn, which has vowed to rid Greece of \"migrant scum\", has seen its popularity soar with the party capturing an unprecedented 6.9% of the vote in parliamentary elections six weeks ago.</p> <p>Racist attacks by black-clad men associated with extremists have escalated dangerously, according to a recent report by Human Rights Watch.</p> <p>On Tuesday anti-immigrant fervour grew following the prosecution of a Pakistani who appeared in court accused of assaulting a teenage Greek girl on the Cycladic iIsle of Paros.</p> <p>In this atmosphere Athens' fragile conservative-lead coalition has taken action. Dendias described the problem of immigrants as \"perhaps even bigger than our financial one\".</p> <p>\"The country is being lost,\" he told Skai TV. \"What is happening now is [Greece's] greatest invasion ever. Not since the Dorians invaded some 3,000 years ago has it received such a flow of immigration.\"</p> <p>Defending the crackdown, he insisted it was imperative to preventing the debt-stricken nation sliding into further chaos and collapse. \"Our social fabric is in danger of unravelling,\" he said.</p> <p>In the coming weeks arrested migrants would be put in a detention centre outside Athens and unused police academies in the north of the country before being deported, he added. Immigrants were often living in such appalling conditions it was \"to their benefit to be repatriated\".</p> <p>On Tuesday Walid Omar, an Iraqi Kurd, was sitting in an internet cafe in Athens' historic city centre when a policeman walked in. The migrant knew the officer well. As a friend of the cafe owner, Omar regularly stopped by and the policeman did too.</p> <p>But the officer was unusually terse. \"He told me and everyone else who did not look Greek to follow him. For the next two hours we were made to wait in a windowless bus, and then under the sun, before they first inspected our clothes and then inspected our papers at the police station,\" said the Iraqi Kurd whose documents proved he was legal in the country that has been his home for the past 15 years.</p> <p>\"The whole procedure took around five hours and there was a lot of shouting,\" he continued in fluent Greek. \"An Algerian, a young boy, was badly beaten in front of everyone. People were really scared.\"</p> <p>Officials said the campaign, which has coincided with the reinforcement of patrols along the Greek-Turkish border, had been also prompted by fears of a new influx of immigrants from Syria.</p> <p>For the most part the media has welcomed the move with the Kathimerini newspaper opining on Tuesday that security was finally \"returning to the centre of Athens\".</p> <p>But the scale of the operation has prompted widespread criticism. The left-wing main opposition Syriza party called the crackdown \"a pogrom\" and \"insult to justice and humanity\". Migrants, it said, were being used to divert attention from unpopular economic policies, including more savage spending cuts, demanded by the EU and IMF in return for much needed rescue funds.</p> <p>\"It is a communications stunt aimed at concealing the true crackdown against public-sector wages, pensions and benefits that the government has agreed to in recent days.\"</p> <p>The Greek office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees expressed fears that refugees from war-torn countries and genuine asylum seekers could be among those summarily deported.</p> <p>Since the start of the year 8,000 migrants have voluntarily sought repatriation, with Greece's situation, economically, socially and politically, having become ever more inhospitable towards them.</p>",
  "<p>Seven Olympic athletes have disappeared amid fears they have fled the London 2012 Games to claim asylum, according to team officials.</p> <p>Five boxers, a swimmer and a footballer from Cameroon were reported missing earlier this week leading team officials to suggest they had \"defected.\"</p> <p>\"What began as rumour has finally turned out to be true,\" David Ojong, the Cameroon mission head said. \"Seven Cameroonian athletes who participated at the 2012 London Olympic Games have disappeared from the Olympic Village.\"</p> <p>The Cameroonian athletes have not broken British immigration rules introduced for the Olympics that allow competitors, their coaches and families to stay in the country until early November.</p> <p>But the athletes' disappearance and Ojong's comments have received widespread attention in Cameroon, where people said they were embarrassed by the news but understood the predicament facing the athletes.</p> <p>\"The conditions in Cameroon are very difficult \u2013 there are no opportunities here and if you have the chance to go the UK, it's understandable that you would want to stay there,\" said Henri Tchounga, a tour guide in Yaounde. \"But my fear is that now Cameroonians will have a bad reputation and in future we will not be able to get visas. It's good for them but a serious problem for the rest of us.\"</p> <p>Ojong said a reserve goalkeeper for the women's soccer team, Drusille Ngako, was the first to disappear. She was not one of the 18 finally retained after pre-Olympic training in Scotland.</p> <p>While her team-mates left for Coventry for their last preparatory encounter against New Zealand, she vanished. A few days later, swimmer Paul Ekane Edingue disappeared along with his personal belongings.</p> <p>Ojong added that five boxers eliminated from the Games, Thomas Essomba, Christian Donfack Adjoufack, Abdon Mewoli, Blaise Yepmou Mendouo and Serge Ambomo, went missing on Sunday from the Olympic village. It was reported that four of the athletes were last seen at a team reception at the Royal Garden hotel, next to Kensington Palace, west London, on Friday.</p> <p>Ojong is understood to have held talks with the sports minister Adoum Garoua at the Olympic Village on Tuesday.</p> <p>It is not the first time Cameroonian athletes have disappeared during international sports competitions.</p> <p>At past Francophonie and Commonwealth games as well as junior soccer competitions, several Cameroonians have quit their delegation without official consent.</p> <p>In June, an Ethiopian torchbearer, Natnael Yemane, 15, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jun/30/missing-olympic-torchbearer-found-nottingham\" title=\"\">also disappeared after he went missing</a> from a hotel in Nottingham.</p> <p>Meanwhile three Sudanese athletes who hoped to compete in the Games were last month reported missing amid claims they would apply for political asylum.</p> <p>Flaubert Mbiekop, an economist from Cameroon, said: \"The bottom line is to look at the economic conditions in Cameroon and see how hard the system is for many people, especially the athletes who don't receive any support from the government. London presented an opportunity; I'm not at all surprised that they took it.\"</p>",

The effort of winning a bronze medal in the gruelling swim, cycle and run event had scourged his body and it was briefly doubtful whether he would even make it on to the podium.</p> <p>It was no surprise the 22-year-old had overheated. The Brownlee brothers, Bradford Grammar school boys <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/video/2012/aug/07/brownlee-brothers-olympic-medal-yorkshire-pub-video?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\">who live together and train together in the West Yorkshire village of Bramhope</a>, destroyed everyone in the 56-strong field apart from the silver medallist from Spain, Javier Gomez. He had to run his best ever race to split the brothers, who have credited the natural training ground of the Yorkshire dales as one of the reasons for their burgeoning success.</p> <p>Alistair, 25, the reigning world champion and now the most dominant triathlete in the sport's 38-year history, won in one hour and 46 seconds in front of huge crowds who packed the banks of the Serpentine and the fields of the Royal park. His 10km run was so fast that he said afterwards he is considering entering the 10,000m track and field event at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow in 2014.</p> <p>He was so dominant that he had time on the home straight to grab a British flag and walk to the finish line which he still crossed 11 seconds ahead of Gomez.</p> <p>\"I ran really, really hard, probably as hard as I have ever run to win that race,\" he said. \"I was very proud and happy but my overwhelming emotion was just to get across the line and get it over and done with. I was immensely proud that my brother could get a bronze.</p> <p>\"We made no secret of the fact that we wanted to get both of us on the podium today and that is not an easy thing to do considering Britain has never won a medal in triathlon. We gave it everything and it shows the strength of training together and pushing each other on successfully.\"</p> <p>At the end, the pair posed together on the gold medal podium position and it summed up what appears to be an exemplary fraternal relationship. \"There's no nastiness, no back-stabbing, no jealousy \u2013 for the simple reason that we trust each other in a race where it's usually every man for himself,\" Jonathan Brownlee has said. But it was a particularly remarkable achievement by Alistair Brownlee.</p> <p>Earlier this year his participation in the London Games looked in doubt when he tore his achilles tendon and he only ran one major race this year before the Olympics. The Brownlees' coach, Malcolm Brown, said Alistair was \"tough as teak\" to win gold after not being able to run for the first four months of the year.</p> <p>\"Today he has outrun the best in the world,\" he said. \"The Brownlees are intelligent, they can make judgment calls and they are great racers and they showed that today.\"</p> <p>The Yorkshiremen's race was masterful and aggressive. The brothers were in the leading group from the first buoy in the 1.5km open water swim and set the pace, with their Team GB \"domestique\" Stuart Hayes, in the 43km bike ride around Hyde Park and past Buckingham Palace.</p> <p>Setting off at a searing pace down South Carriage Drive towards Hyde Park Corner, five of the world's best triathletes formed a breakaway group with Jonathan Brownlee making the pace first down Constitution Hill. With them were Gomez, the Slovakian Richard Varga, who has been training with the Brownlees in the dales, and the Italian Alessandro Fabian. The pace immediately appeared to take its toll as Canada's Simon Whitfield, the Beijing silver medallist, collided with the Costa Rican Leonardo Chacon, taking both men crashing down.</p> <p>By the second lap the leading group stretched to an 18-second lead over the chasing pack, which included the defending champion from Germany, Jan Frodeno. The group was reeled back in, but the legs of the Brownlees' rivals were tiring ahead of the run. News came through that Jonathan Brownlee had received a 15-second penalty for jumping on his bike a fraction of a second too quickly after the swim.</p> <p>\"I didn't realise I'd done anything wrong,\" he said. \"At first when I saw the board I thought: 'Ah, 31, Alistair's got a penalty, what an idiot'. Then I looked at my arm and realised I was 31. It was super hard for me, but I don't think it changed the result.\"</p> <p>Alistair Brownlee said after the race such penalties were \"a disgrace that are ruining the sport\".</p> <p>In the run, the Brownlees set off in third and fourth places and they hit the front immediately with Gomez tucked in behind them as they passed the Diana Memorial. By the third lap of four, the leading three were 25 seconds ahead of the next fastest runner, but then Jonathan Brownlee started to struggle with the pace his brother and Gomez were setting and settled for a remarkable bronze, which he claimed in front of an ecstatic crowd after a 30-minute delay to allow him to recover.</p> <p>\"I got given glucose and water and lay down,\" he said. \"It's part of the sport. It's a tough, tough sport and when I got my penalty it got even tougher.\"</p> <p>Frodeno saluted his successor. \"Coming back from injury he has taken the field apart,\" he said. \"It was going to take a mistake from his side in order for someone else to take the title today. It is the first time in Olympic history that the title has been won by a favourite and I take my hat off to him because there was huge pressure on him.\"</p> <p>Asked if he should start training on the Yorkshire dales too, Martinez said: \"Perhaps that's the secret. They all expected a 1-2 party for the British. I could beat one of them, but not both.\"</p>",
  "<p>Indian relatives of the victims of the Wisconsin Sikh temple shooting have called on US authorities to release the bodies of the victims, as more details emerge of the dead and wounded.</p> <p>Most of those killed by Wade Michael Page, a 41-year-old army veteran, were Indian nationals; some were religious workers who had travelled from India, where the Sikh religion was founded in the 15th century.</p> <p>Investigators have said they are still trying to work out what motivated Page to carry out his attack on Sunday.</p> <p>Dr Harcharan Gill, a veterinarian and trustee of the Oak Tree temple, said the Wisconsin community was expecting families of the two injured victims, Punjab Singh and Santokh Singh, to arrive from Delhi on Tuesday.</p> <p>Gill, whose brother-in-law Satwant Singh Kaleka was among those killed, said Punjab Singh was seriously ill. \"Punjab Singh is very critical and has gone into a coma after undergoing surgery for his bullet wounds. He had arrived here just a few days ago,\" Gill said.</p> <p>He said Santokh Singh had been in the US for about three or four years, and was in the process of applying for a green card, so that his family could join him. He had traveled to India last month to visit his family in West Delhi.</p> <p>One woman, Parmjit Kaur Toor, 41, died on Sunday. The four men killed were Seeta Singh, 41; Parkash Singh, 49; Ranjit Singh, 39; and Subegh Singh, 84.</p> <p>The traveling religious workers who died, or were injured, would visit immigrant Sikh communities in America to help with duties such as reciting of the scriptures at the gurdwaras, and perform rituals in other community events like marriages. \"A morning prayer at the temple had got over at 10.20am, and just as these workers were coming out on a break, they found themselves in the face of Wade's gun attack\", said Gill.</p> <p>Two of those killed, Seeta Singh, 41, and Ranjit Singh, 39, were brothers. Gill said: \"Ranjit Singh had been here for many years, but his brother joined him recently, about four to five months ago.\" They are survived by their wives and children, who live in Delhi.</p> <p>The former president of the body that manages Delhi's gurdwaras, Harwinder Singh Sarna, who visited both bereaved families in Delhi on Tuesday, told the Guardian that they were struggling to make sense of Sunday's killings. He added an appeal for American authorities: \"We would request them to release the bodies of Ranjit Singh or Seeta Singh. If that is not possible, they should issue visas on an urgent basis for their families so that they can travel to the US and perform the last rites.\"</p> <p>Sarna said his organisation had announced financial assistance for the families, including a fund to meet the educational expenses of the children whose fathers died. The body also wishes to donate $5,000 to lieutenant Brian Murphy, the police officer who was seriously injured in the attack. Despite his injuries, Murphy tried to wave off assistance from other officers and directed them into the temple instead.</p> <p>\"We are very grateful to him for his courage and we will be very happy if he would accept this,\" Sarna said.</p> <p>Wade's oldest victim was Subegh Singh Khattra, 84, a wheat farmer from Punjab who emigrated to Wisconsin in 2004 to live with his son, Baljinder Singh Khattra.</p> <p>Baljinder, a taxi driver, who moved to America as a young immigrant in the mid-1990s, said he asked his aging parents to come and live with him so that he could take greater care of them. \"My father would go off to the gurdwara early every morning. He was devout, but that was also a place where he could meet other elderly members of the community, and escape being lonely and bored at home.\" Baljinder said he was yet to see his father's body. </p> <p>Baljinder's wife, Kulwant Kaur, who was at the temple during Sunday morning's attack, saw her father-in-law lying in the hallway, bleeding from a wound in his head, as she was being rescued by security officials responding to the attack.</p> <p>Baljinder said he was moved by the fact that all his neighbours, across various backgrounds, had reached out to his family since the tragedy, and offered solace. \"It was just one individual who lost his head that morning and committed this senseless killings. May God give his soul peace,\" he said.</p> <p>Wade's mother, Laura Lynn, has said she was devastated by her son's actions and that she apologised to the victims and the families. She told <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2184602/Wisconsin-temple-shooting-Devastated-mother-Sikh-temple-killer-Wade-Michael-Page-apologizes-sons-victims.html\">Mail Online</a>: \"He was such a precious little boy, that's all I can say. We was a very fun-loving, typical little boy. He was just a very soft spoken, gentle young man.\"</p> <p>Lynn said she had not been in contact with him in the 12 years since she and his father divorced.</p> <p>Investigators have said they are still ascertaining what exactly pushed Wade to open fire. The Southern Poverty Law Center said in a statement that Wade Michael Page was a member of two racist skinhead bands \u2013 End Apathy and Definite Hate, the latter a band whose album Violent Victory featured a drawing of a disembodied white arm punching a black man in the face.</p> <p>The fist is tattooed with the letters \"HFFH,\" the acronym for the phrase \"Hammerskins Forever, Forever Hammerskins.\" The Hammerskins is a nationwide skinhead organization with regional factions and chapters that once dominated the racist skinhead movement in the United States, the SPLC said.</p> <p>The killings have revived the debate over America's troubled relationship with guns, and now foreign nationals are weighing in, too. When US ambassador Nancy Powell visited one of Delhi's leading Sikh temples, the Gurudwara Bangla Sahib, on Monday, members gave her a written statement that dealt with gun control as well as prejudice against Sikhs living in the US.</p> <p>Sarna, who met Powell, said: \"Powell assured us that the US government would do its best to prevent such incidents from happening again in the future. But we are concerned about the gun culture and would ask the American authorities to try to curb this in their country. Innocent lives were lost in Colorado too because of this.\"</p> <p>Responding to a tweet, India's ambassador in Washington, Nirupama Rao, said on Twitter on Monday evening: \"u can't expect me to lead charge on gun control as a foreigner here. Although, it has to come from American citizens, and them alone.\"</p>",
  "<h2>Canoe Sprint 9:30am</h2> <p>Wednesday sees four finals: the men's kayak single (K1) 1,000m, men's canoe single (C1) 1,000m, men's kayak double (K2) 1,000m and women's kayak four (K4) 500m. Richard Jefferies, Britain's only athlete in the canoe, bowed out of the sprinton Tuesday. Louisa Sawers, Rachel Cawthorn, Angela Hannah and Jess Walker will be competing in the women's kayak four. But the event everyone will be watching is the men's kayak single final, for which the defending champion Tim Brabants, who put his medical career on hold for one last shot at Olympic glory, qualified by only by&#xa0;0.049sec. The 35-year-old had surgery in 2010 on a pectoral tendon injury and was the last of four qualifiers from his semi-final.</p> <h2>Athletics 10am</h2> <p>Wednesday sees qualification rounds in the men's pole vault, where Steven Lewis will be hoping to make up for Holly Bleasdale's disappointing sixth place, women's hammer and men's javelin. It is the first round of the men's 5,000m, women's 800m and the men's decathlon. The semi-finals of the men's 200m should see the defending champion Usain Bolt and his training partner, Yohan Blake, sail to the finals. Bolt ran a leisurely 20.39sec to win his heat. Plus, it is the men's 110m hurdles, though minus China's darling Liu Xiang, who limped out of the heats with a foot injury for the second consecutive Games, women's long jump, women's 400m hurdles and women's 200m.</p> <h2>Sailing 1pm</h2> <p>With the sailing team still buoyed by the success of Ben Ainslie, who secured his place in history by winning his fourth Olympic gold medal in the men's Finn, Team GB will be looking to Stevie Morrison and Ben Rhodes in the men's 49er. The two are currently in the bronze medal position but will be going all out for the gold. The women's 470 races continue and Great Britain go against Russia in the women's elliott 6m quarter-finals.</p> <h2>Boxing 1:30pm</h2> <p>With the introduction of women's boxing into the Olympics for the first time, the sport is in semi-final stages for the fly (51kg), lightweight (60kg) and middleweight (75kg). Russia's Elena Savelyeva made history last Sunday when she won the first ever women's Olympic boxing bout. Wednesday's events also include the men's light flyweight (49kg), men's light heavyweight (81kg) and men's light welterweight (64kg) which will see Thomas Stalker fight for at least a bronze medal in the quarter-finals.</p> <h2>Basketball 2pm</h2> <p>Team USA, who are undefeated and have won 13 gold medals since the 1936 Berlin Olympics, face off against Australia as the men's basketball reaches the quarter-final stage. Last Thursday the Dream Team set a world record for the highest total ever in Olympic play in their 156-73 rout of Nigeria. They will meet the winners of Brazil and Argentina in the next round, having already dispensed with the latter 126-97 on Monday night.</p> <h2>Taekwondo 3pm</h2> <p>The gold medal quest begins on Wednesday for the men's 58kg and women's 49kg. It is set to be an action-packed day with the quarter-finals, semi-finals and finals all in the space of seven hours. Wu Jingyu, China's 25-year-old defending champion, will be on everyone's radar&#xa0;and has looked in imperious form so far.</p> <h2><strong>Brits to watch</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <h2>Mo Farah, athletics: 5,000m, 10.45am<br></h2> <p>The Somali-born Briton, who won one of the three gold medals during Team GB's Super Saturday, is to set run again in the men's 5,000m heats, and his family will no doubt be looking forward to joining him on another victory lap at the Olympic Stadium. Farah's outstanding run and marvellous sprint finish gave Britain its first ever Olympic gold medal in the 10,000m, even though at the age of 29 victory might have been beyond him. Farah is the 5,000m world champion and on Tuesday Sebastian Coe backed him to add the Olympic gold. \"In every championship he has got a little better,\" Coe said. \"Mo is fearless. I always thought his better chance was in the five.\" Britain will be hoping that Farah has had sufficient ice baths and rest to ensure further success.</p> <h2>Tim Brabants, Canoe Sprint: men's kayak single (K1) 1,000m, 9.30am<br></h2> <p>Tim Brabants, the defending champion, is not yet firing on all cylinders at London 2012. The 35-year-old made the final only after finishing last of the qualifiers in his semi-final, edging out Bulgaria's Miroslav Kirchev by just 0.049sec. After easing through his heat Brabants went off hard at the start, running second at the halfway point. But he struggled to maintain the ferocious pace and dropped back in the last 500 metres. Brabants said: \"I'm not quite in Beijing shape, but I feel good. I'm in the final and anything can happen. It was a tough race, so I'm really&#xa0;relieved with that result. I drew the outside lane on the really bad side of the course, but the roar of the crowd&#xa0;was incredible and pushed me&#xa0;on.\"</p> <h2>Nicola Adams, Boxing, women's fly 51kg, 1.45pm<br></h2> <p>Britain's Nicola Adams is already guaranteed a medal after she outclassed Stoyka Petrova, 16-7. On Wednesday she fights India's five-time world champion Mary Kom and is hoping her size advantage will pay: Kom moved up two weight divisions in order to make the flyweight limit. The Leeds fighter, who said she enjoyed every moment of Monday's victory, was so dominant that she even had time to do an Ali shuffle in the final round. \"It's going to be a tough match but I'm going to have the height and reach advantage and will try to use all my attributes,\" said Adams. \"You've got to be special to win five world titles.\" Adams is the last British woman in the competition after Natasha Jonas lost a storming quarter-final battle to Ireland's Katie Taylor.</p>",

  "<p>When the International Olympic Committee president, Jacques Rogge, declared at the opening ceremony that London 2012 was \"<a href=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/2012olympics/2012-07/28/content_15626066.htm\" title=\"\">a major boost for gender equality</a>\", perhaps he had not heard that on their flights to London the Japanese women's football team and the Australian women's basketball team were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/19/london-2012-japan-australia-sexism\" title=\"\">relegated to economy class, while the men flew business</a>.</p> <p>Still, hopes that this Olympics may yet live up to its billing as the \"equality games\" have been boosted as the Japanese Football Association (JFA) suggested its women footballers may get an upgrade on the way home, while Basketball Australia promised a review of Olympic travel policy.</p> <p>The JFA's treatment of its female team prompted outrage, in less than 24 hours more than 17,000 signed an online petition on the campaign website <a href=\"http://www.change.org/petitions/jfa-provide-equal-treatment-to-the-japanese-women-s-and-men-s-soccer-teams-on-their-flight-back-home-from-the-olympics-nadeshiko-london2012#\" title=\"\">Change.org</a> to push the JFA to change their minds. Or maybe they just stuck to a promise: after the row exploded the chairman stated that a business-class flight for the women \"would be considered for the women's team if they bring a medal home\".</p> <p>On Monday, the <em>Nadeshiko</em>, as they are known, won <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics-2012-football\" title=\"\">2-1 against France</a> in the women's football semi-final, assuring themselves a place in the final on Thursday and at least a silver medal.</p> <p>Coach Norio Sasaki said the women may now fly business class back to Tokyo. \"The Japan Football Association is trying to work something out,\" Sasaki told Kyodo News. \"When we came here we came in premium economy and there wasn't a problem,\" he said.</p> <p>But critics will continue to question why the more successful women's team \u2013 they won the World Cup in Germany last year, bringing joy to a country still reeling from the tsumani which killed 20,000 people \u2013 were given places in economy while the men's squad relaxed in business class on the same plane. Asked about the situation at the time Homare Sawa, the star of Japan's women's football team and Fifa's 2011 world player of the year, told journalists: \"I guess it should have been the other way around. Even just in terms of age, we are senior.\"</p> <p>And the upgrade does not even appear to be in the bag. \"The problem is when we go back there will probably not be enough business seats available. If that's the case we will be in premium again,\" said Sasaki. \"If you look at the way we played then you will see that we are very patient and would put up with economy.\"</p> <p>The Japanese women, nicknamed <em>Nadeshiko</em> after a pink flower that symbolises femininity and grace in Japan, have shown no mercy in their quest to win gold. They beat Brazil 2-0 in the quarter-finals.</p> <p>The less successful men's team also reached the semi-finals, for the first time in 44 years, beating Egypt 3-0. They will now face Mexico on Tuesday.</p> <p>Sohko Fujimoto, 28, co-organiser of the petition on Change.org said the debate was an opportunity for the JFA to prove its commitment to women's sport in Japan. \"Whatever happens we'll be cheering on <em>Nadeshiko</em> on Thursday,\" she said.</p> <p>\"If the JFA lends an ear to the thousands of fans around the world who have backed our campaign, that would be a great result, and starting point, for women's soccer in both Japan and around the globe.\"</p> <p>There is also movement from <a href=\"http://www.basketball.net.au/index.php?id=284\" title=\"\">Basketball Australia</a> which was criticised for flying the male squad, known as the Boomers, in business class while the female squad, the Opals, flew economy. The Australian women have taken silver at the last three Games. The men have never won a medal.</p> <p>In a statement, Basketball Australia's acting CEO, Scott Derwin, <a href=\"http://www.rte.ie/sport/olympics/basketball/2012/0720/329920-aussie-basketball-to-review-travel-discrimination/\" title=\"\">promised a review </a>of the travelling arrangements, which were a \"longstanding policy\", with each team given a budget, over which they had control. He said that, historically, the Opals had been given more funding.</p> <p>However, he recognised that the furore had left the organisation open to claims of sexism. \"The simple fact is when a policy results in gender inequality, it's very clearly not the right policy going forward,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I am putting in place a review of our Olympic travel policy with the goal of ensuring there is equity between travel arrangements for the men's and women's teams attending future Olympics.\"</p> <p>Kristina Keneally, incoming CEO, welcomed the move. \"In this day and age, there's just no excuse for men's and women's sporting teams to be treated differently when they both compete at the same world class level. In fact, in this circumstance, the disparity is even more glaring when you consider that our women's basketball team is one of the best in the world \u2013 enjoying the No 2 spot in international rankings.\"</p>",
  "<p>There's no place like Tom Waits' home. There's no home, at any rate, quite like Tom Waits' place. The Silver Lake court cottage looks like the neglected back room of a slumping thrift shop, its contents to be filed when there's room up front.</p> <p>\"You might see something here that I've been looking for for six months,\" Waits growls from amid the chaos,\" and I wish you'd tell me because I've lost a lot of things.\"</p> <p>A bookshelf holding poetry volumes and vintage hardcover copies of Angry Young Men novels is the room's only concession to Beat culture. A copy of Kerouac's Visions of Cody and an album featuring Kerouac reading to Steve Allen's piano accompaniment receive no special treatment. They lie among the skin magazines, traffic tickets, discarded socks and shoes, beneath the Waits Towers \u2013 precarious piles of records, tapes, boxes and beer cans atop hidden pieces of furniture. The ashtrays overflow with Old Gold butts, and a huge neon sign proclaiming \"Cocktails\" leans into one corner. Waits, on a dare, unbolted it from the front of a downtown bar one night. It was heavy, but the demise of his '54 Cadillac's power steering has led to strong biceps.</p> <p>Tom Waits is one of the most critically admired writers and performers around and the object of a small but intense and growing following. Whether you're a friend, foe (\"You are an insensitive bastard and I wish that I'd never met you,\" reads a sample of his fan mail. \"Also you are extremely cruel and thoughtless\") or of no opinion, you must concede he's a one of a kind.</p> <p>Artistically, he's a specialist, the poet of the heart of Saturday night \u2013 \"the dark, warm narcotic American night,\" he calls it in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xWLf3tNzT4\" title=\"\">Putnam County</a>. His flair for pungent detail and his sensuous imagery bring vibrancy and dimension to his neon maze and its asphalt escape chutes (from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6CDa-z1MUY\" title=\"\">Ol' '55</a>, the Waits \"signature piece\" that he wishes weren't: \"I'm riding with lady luck/ Freeway cars and trucks/ Stars beginnin' to fade/ And I lead the parade.\")</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0Fju9o8BVJ8?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0Fju9o8BVJ8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0Fju9o8BVJ8\">Reading on mobile? Watch here</a></p> <p>From the vantage point of the determined loner, he strolls the all-night diners, burrito stands, truck stops and Hollywood dives on a sacramental midnight mission, ending in a dawn that, for him, cracks like a bullwhip and turns the sky the color of Pepto-Bismol. Paul Bunyan used logs as toothpicks; for Waits, the parking meters are walking sticks.</p> <p>The Waits recipe contains no artificial flavoring, and so no condescension toward the bleary characters who populate his night, threatening, amusing, comforting, sometimes loving. His turf doubles as an emotional landscape, where loneliness lurks like a mugger and lures like a hooker, and where polished chrome attains a rare beauty. Waits' distinction in an age of advanced artifice is that image and actuality correspond. When you find him hunched over the bar at a seedy Hollywood tavern, he's not slumming in search of a good album cover shot. The car isn't rented and dented for effect. He doesn't need a designer to give him the look of a piece of street-corner flotsam drifting in from the Great Depression. He's a natural, even if it does take a bit of effort.</p> <p>Waits follows an aisle of debris to the bulky console hi-fi in the corner and slips on a Duke Ellington-Ray Brown album. Before he ambles back through the shambles he turns on the hot plate, starting a pot of water that will boil with a metallic tinkling sound for most of the late afternoon.</p> <p>\"I deal with the things that I know most about,\" he says, nodding his head rapidly to the music and grafting the beat into conversation. \"You almost have to create situations in order to write about them, so I live in a constant state of self-imposed poverty. I don't want to live any other way.</p> <p>\"There's not much difference between what I appear to be on stage and what I am. I think people like that, that I'm not trying to pull a caper. It's easy for me, 'cause it's not such a large jump. I don't have to get into a costume. I'm in contact and I'm in context \u2026 But all of a sudden it becomes your image, and it's hard to tell where the image stops and you begin or where you stop and the image begins. Any image I have, it's just what I do, but it comes off as being very pretentious. When you're a bit in the public astigmatism, anything you do seems like you did it so somebody would see you do it, like showing up at the right parties.\"</p> <p>Waits, 26, rates his childhood as \"standard\" and recalls high school in San Diego as a social playground where he was torn between his brainy acquaintances and those making the boozing, cruising scene. \"I finally went with the hoods,\" he says, \"and watched my California Scholarship Federation plaque melt subsequently.\"</p> <p>He began making recreational pilgrimages to Tijuana and laid considerable groundwork in his five years on the graveyard shift at a San Diego restaurant. \"I knew when I was working there I was going to do something with it, yeah. I didn't know how, but I felt it every night.\"</p> <p>Waits was a cultural misfit in the Swinging 60s: \"I didn't have black lights or Jimi Hendrix posters or sand candles, so I was really going through an identity crisis. I felt a little misplaced.\" His discovery of the Beat writers came as a breath of fresh air and furnished a strong stylistic impulse that surfaced recently on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/album/ae446997-5355-3b5d-9dce-8a48ee1044ac\" title=\"\">Nighthawks at the Diner</a>, his third Asylum album.</p> <p>On the record, cut with an audience in the studio, Waits breaks the mold of the conventional singer-songwriter and presents himself as a be-bop raconteur, a scatting storyteller and spontaneous, rapid-fire imagist reciting to the fourth-gear highway rhythms of a smoky jazz trio. The inescapable first impression is that of the 50s jazz-and-poetry format, but Waits is leery of the term poetry and thinks that too much is made of his Beatnik connection.</p> <p>\"I hate that reference because of the stigma that's attached to it \u2013 Maynard G Krebs with some bongos. I'm not having a vicarious 50s thrill or trying to come off like Manhattan Transfer. Stylistically, most writers and performers draw from wherever they can. There's all kinds of resource out there. You suck it up if you can. You should be thirsty for it, whatever it is, and then integrate it into what you're doing now.</p> <p>\"I don't like the word poetry and I don't like poetry readings and I usually don't like poets. I would much prefer describing myself and what I do as: I'm kind of a curator, and I'm kind of a night-owl reporter. Maybe a little bit of Damon Runyon in me or something \u2026 I always had a great appreciation for jazz, but I'm a very pedestrian musician. I get by. I like to think that my main instrument is vocabulary.\"</p> <p>Waits was 19 when he moved north and started the Troubadour hoot-night hustle. \"I was as ambitious as hell. I wasn't any good, but I was ambitious, and I thought I was better than anybody, and I sucked raw eggs. But you have to think that way. To let an audience intimidate you is musical suicide.\" He gradually honed his stagecraft \u2013 \"hanging cut, listening to stories, picking up ideas, one-liners, jokes\" \u2013 and eventually developed his highly individual stage persona and style.</p> <p>\"A performance is not real life,\" he asserts. \"I mean, to light up a cigarette here is one thing, but to light one on stage is a whole other world. I have to be completely aware of the figure that I cut on stage. I'm a caricature of myself up there. It's just an exaggeration of my own personality.</p> <p>\"That's very important, personality, and most performers don't think about it, I guess. Maybe most performers don't have one, or else they don't know how to show it to you on stage, which is the hardest thing in the world to do and come off unpretentious. It really has to be choreographed and calculated \u2026 to make it look spontaneous. I'm an entertainer, just like Rodney Dangerfield is an entertainer. I have one prop, an old suitcase, and the rest is just creating an illusion.</p> <p>\"This is where I live when I'm at home,\" he says, his eyes rummaging through the rubble. \"I don't have designs on affluence. I'm not eccentric, I don't think I know what I'm doing. I'm just trying to be bona fide, and not have to compromise my integrity too much. It's a lot easier to deal with being an underdog than it is being a household word. I'm a legend in my own mind, a kind of tumor in my own mind. I'm not on the verge of national prominence or anything.</p> <p>\"I tell you, though, I'm real big in Philadelphia. That's all I know. Anyplace else surprises me. Philadelphia boy\" \u2013 a halting James Dean smile flits across his face \u2013 \"in Philadelphia I get recognised at intersections.\"</p>",

It was only in the 10,000 metre run of a magical triathlon that Alistair and Jonny Brownlee accepted there would have to be a winner. In a heart-thumping display of athleticism and grit Alistair, the elder of the two, took a gold medal in front of a raucous crowd of more than 300,000 lining the streets around Hyde Park. His brother, who had been forced to take a 15-second penalty during the run around the Serpentine, took an inspired bronze behind the Spanish double world champion Javier G\u00f3mez.</p> <p>The extraordinary Brownlee brothers had not planned it like that. In some of their dreams about this race they had hoped they might cross the line together, though they knew Olympic rules would not have permitted a dead heat. As it was, the penalty \u2013 which Jonny incurred for setting off on his bike marginally too quickly \u2013 at least ensured that bragging rights in the home they share in west Yorkshire might continue to be disputed just a little.</p> <p>Team GB has not been short of stories&#xa0;for the ages this week, but this one promised to be the oldest narrative of all. Sibling rivalries, from Cain and Abel to Ed and David Miliband, have rarely had happy endings, but in this, like almost everything else, the Brownlee brothers proved an exception to the rule.</p> <p>As the field of 55 athletes plunged into the Serpentine at 11.30am there was a great cacophony of noise and expectation. London loves the triathlon, not least because many people like to imagine they perform a mini version of it most mornings just to get to work, slogging on bikes through monsoon rain, jogging like the clappers through the Royal parks. When I arrived at the course three hours before the scheduled start time the route around the lake was already five and six deep with spectators. It was a day straight out of the Brownlees' home county. Granite skies, the threat of drizzle, just as they would have wanted.</p> <p>For those of us who have only ever circumnavigated this finger of water in a pedalo on a Sunday morning \u2013 and, upwind, found that experience wearying enough \u2013 there is something breathtaking about watching the athletes dive into the Serpentine to swim for a kilometre and a half in what amounts to a warm-up for the 40km bike ride and 10km run that follows.</p> <p>There was a big grin on Alistair's face as he prepared to hit the water, as if all this was the best fun imaginable. His brother, at his side, is the more obsessive of the two, a kit-checker, somewhat superstitious. For 17 minutes they thrashed exuberantly around the lake in a leading group of five that took nearly a minute out of most of the field.</p> <p>There always seems the potential for farce as the athletes have to strip off their wetsuits and jump on a bike in the transition between the first two disciplines. As he performed this wardrobe change Jonny had a little glance around for his brother, and you wonder if in that moment his contentious penalty was given \u2013 the first of his career. As soon as news of it was confirmed about 15km into the bike ride, the pair had one or two shouted discussions at the head of the peloton about what to do.</p> <p>Speaking after the race Alistair recalled that he told his brother \"not to worry, that he could still get a medal\". All sorts of \"two little boys had two little toys\" scenarios started running through 300,000 heads \u2013 and also through the head of the elder sibling: \"I was debating with myself the best tactics of getting Jonny through,\" he said. \"I decided to go out as hard as I can in the run to split the field. I was really proud he managed to pull it off.\"</p> <p>There had been a \"chest out, catch us if you can\" Mo Farah mentality to the Brownlees' approach to this race from the start, particularly from Alistair. After the pedantic penalty was awarded, this spirit intensified. Before the race there were some rumours of mutterings, mainly in French accents, about the possibilities of making this a tactical contest, negating the sheer aerobic power of the brothers and their nearest contender, G\u00f3mez. Stuart Hayes, the third British competitor in the race \u2013 though not the third-fastest British triathlete \u2013 prevented this by effectively acting as a <em>domestique</em> for the brothers, a tactic frowned on in some quarters in this most individual of sports. In the event, Hayes struggled to keep up in the water but came into his own to pull them through several laps of the cycling circuit. The route took the field under the Wellington Arch and past Buckingham Palace, a journey you imagine both of these brothers will be making again, come the next honours list.</p> <p>It was on the first three laps of the run that Alistair proved what a thrilling competitor he is. The brothers and G\u00f3mez took nearly 30 seconds out of the rest in that awesome opening burst, allowing Jonny to take his penalty \u2013 jogging on the spot at the side of the track for what he later described as \"forever, to be honest, a long, long time\" \u2013 and still rejoin the race comfortably ahead of the rest of the field. The early injection of pace was Alistair's last gift to Jonny, though. \"You are on your own now, bro,\" he seemed to say as he moved further away from G\u00f3mez, on what amounted to the most splendid of all morning runs in this park, past the Diana memorial fountain, union flags all the way.</p> <p>This has been an extraordinary few days for Yorkshire. First Jessica Ennis, now Alistair and Jonny. The brothers hail from a village near Leeds called Bramhope in which their parents, both doctors, also live. They both attended Bradford Grammar School where they were as known as much for their modesty in talking about their sporting triumphs as for the fact of them. They were fell runners before they were triathletes, out in all weathers in the hills near their home.</p> <p>All of that work, begun as teenagers, came through in the final kilometre of this most gruelling event. Farah won his Olympic 10,000m in a time of 27min 30sec. After his world-class swim and bike ride Alistair came home in 29min 07sec, jogging down the home straight draped in a union flag. As he approached&#xa0;the finish line he actually stopped at the tape, having checked behind him first of course to make sure G\u00f3mez was far enough behind, and slowly walked through the ribbon. Immediately he collapsed to the ground&#xa0;and lay flat out on the ground, rolling over to shake hands with the also-prone G\u00f3mez.</p> <p>Only when Jonny crossed the line did Alistair get to his feet to embrace him. Jonny collapsed soon after finishing and required medical attention \u2013 ice and glucose \u2013 before he could take his place on the medal rostrum, side by side once again with the competitor he has known since the day he was born. Alistair had a little glance across to his kid brother as \"God Save the Queen\" struck up: \"All right?\" he mouthed, with a great, broad smile. Not only Olympic champion, but also victor for the time being in the ultimate family rivalry.</p>",

  "<h2>The winner</h2> <p>Most people's idea of a Hollywood blockbuster is a massively budgeted film with significant amounts of production scale, action and visual effects, probably based on a major property such as book, toy, video game or comic book. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148370/ted\" title=\"\">Ted</a>, a comedy about a talking teddy bear, isn't it. But there was everything blockbuster-sized about the film's UK opening box office: \u00a39.33m, including \u00a33.40m in Wednesday/Thursday previews. That's not quite the heady heights of Avengers Assemble (\u00a315.78m, including \u00a32.55m in previews) or The Dark Knight Rises (\u00a314.36m), but it's not far off The Amazing Spider-Man (\u00a311.09m, including \u00a34.33m previews) and is level with Prometheus (\u00a36.24m).</p> <p>It's extremely rare for a comedy to open at this level, especially one featuring original characters that isn't based on established material. The Hangover debuted with \u00a33.19m including \u00a3444,000 in previews in 2009, while June 2011 saw Bridesmaids kick off its run with \u00a33.44m including \u00a31.03m in previews. Comedy sequels have delivered bigger numbers, notably Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason (\u00a310.44m including \u00a33.31m in previews) and The Hangover: Part II (\u00a310.41m, including \u00a32.03m in previews). Top opening for a comedy is The Inbetweeners Movie (\u00a313.22m, including \u00a34.57m in previews), but that had the advantage of a significant brand name.</p> <p>Assuming Ted goes on to achieve the success you'd project from such an opening, it will probably be the only blockbuster-sized hit in UK cinemas this year based on original material, if you count Prometheus as part of the Alien franchise. So far, all nine films that have crossed the \u00a320m barrier \u2013 Avengers Assemble, The Dark Knight Rises, The Amazing Spider-Man, Ice Age 4, Prometheus, The Hunger Games, Men in Black 3, The Woman in Black and The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel are sequels or based on a comic book, novel or stage play. Likely to join them later in the year are <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/125622/hobbit\" title=\"\">The Hobbit</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/144416/skyfall\" title=\"\">Skyfall</a>, the final Twilight film and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/147830/madagascar-3\" title=\"\">Madagascar 3</a>: all sequels, or based on books, or both. If Pixar's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/146821/brave\" title=\"\">Brave</a> matches Wall-E (\u00a322.9m) rather than Cars (\u00a316.5m), then that will be the only other \u00a320m hit this year featuring wholly original characters.</p> <p>The next tier of 2012 UK hits are all, likewise, based on established elements: War Horse (\u00a318.6m), The Muppets (\u00a316.8m), American Pie: Reunion (\u00a316.8m), The Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists (\u00a316.4m) and Snow White and the Huntsman (\u00a315.7m). The biggest hit so far this year based on original material is The Dictator, with \u00a311.4m. Below that are The Iron Lady (\u00a39.9m) and The Artist (\u00a39.8m).</p> <h2>The family battle</h2> <p>While the adult-skewing <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141046/dark-knight-rises\" title=\"\">Dark Knight Rises</a> sits impressively in second place, and has now cracked \u00a340m after only 17 days of release, the four titles below it are all scrapping fiercely for the family audience. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148529/diary-of-a-wimpy-kid\" title=\"\">Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days</a>, with \u00a31.54m, has opened comfortably ahead of previous instalment, 2011's Rodrick Rules (\u00a31.48m, including \u00a3380,000 in previews), as well as 2010's original Wimpy Kid (\u00a3671,000 including \u00a3238,000 in previews). <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148325/ice-age-4\" title=\"\">Ice Age 4: Continental Drift</a> (down just 21% from the previous weekend) and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148521/dr-seuss-the-lorax\" title=\"\">Dr Seuss' The Lorax</a> (31%) both posted strong holds, but the real story is how they are performing midweek, during the current school holiday. Over the past seven days, Ice Age 4 added \u00a33.45m and The Lorax \u00a32.80m. The Ice Age film has just overtaken Prometheus to be the year's fourth biggest hit, and should soon edge out The Amazing Spider-Man for third place.</p> <p>With a debut of \u00a3820,000, Pixar's Brave has made what at first sight seems a lacklustre start to its run, but of course that's from Scottish, Irish and Northern Irish cinemas, where earlier school holidays necessitated a different release date. The film arrives in England and Wales on 13 August. Based on the assumption that the territories it's playing usually account for 15% of UK and Ireland box office, Brave's opening equates to \u00a35.5m. A note of caution: since Brave has exceptional local appeal in Scotland, normal assumptions might not apply. Ice Age 4: Continental Drift, which opted for a similar Scottish/Irish initial rollout, debuted with \u00a3853,000. Pushed back into 187 cinemas, Mirror Mirror returned to ninth place in its 18th week of release.</p> <h2>The arthouse market</h2> <p>Unless you count Steven Soderbergh's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148230/magic-mike\" title=\"\">Magic Mike</a>, the top arthouse title is once again <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/147796/searching-for-sugar-man\" title=\"\">Searching for Sugar Man</a>, with a solid hold, down just 10%, albeit boosted by an increased screen count. With \u00a3164,000 after just 10 days of release, the film has already passed the lifetime totals of such acclaimed music documentaries as Anvil! The Story of Anvil! (\u00a3157,000), Dig! (\u00a3115,000) and Metallica: Some Kind of Monster (\u00a3111,000). In fact, it's rare for music docs that don't contain a significant portion of performance to work at the box office, the recent Marley (\u00a3954,000) being a notable exception. Including concert-based titles, top performer is Michael Jackson: This Is It (\u00a39.8m).</p> <h2>The future</h2> <p>Despite significant competition from the Olympics on TV, with 17 million tuning in for the men's 10,000m final on Saturday, and 20m watching the 100m final on Sunday, it was boom time for cinemas all weekend. The sixth-best frame of the past year delivered grosses 47% up on the equivalent period from 2011, when Super 8 and Mr Popper's Penguins were the top new releases. Takings are also 51% above average for the year. That momentum looks unlikely to continue, since both Brave and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/147726/bourne-legacy\" title=\"\">The Bourne Legacy</a> don't arrive until Monday 13 August, leaving <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/146748/step-up-4\" title=\"\">Step Up 4: Miami Heat</a> to do the heavy lifting this coming weekend. Alternatives include British revenge drama Offender, Fernando Meirelles' <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/143056/360\" title=\"\">360</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148123/jackpot\" title=\"\">Jackpot</a>, the latest twisted crime tale adapted from a book by Norway's Jo Nesbo (Headhunters).</p> <h2>Top 10 films</h2> <p><strong>1.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148370/ted\" title=\"\">Ted</a>, \u00a39,330,700 from 509 sites (<strong>New</strong>)</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141046/dark-knight-rises\" title=\"\">The Dark Knight Rises</a>, \u00a34,290,605 from 567 sites.

  "<p>Reports that consumer spending in Britain has crashed as a result of the Olympics look to have been largely unfounded, according to <a href=\"http://www.visa.co.uk/en.aspx\" title=\"\">Visa</a> figures that show spending marginally up during the first week of the Games.</p> <p>The credit card supplier said domestic spending on British Visa cards reached \u00a37.4bn last week, up 3.4% on the previous seven days, but only a modest increase of \u00a3200m on the same week in 2011.</p> <p>Spending on cards by international visitors in the UK in the same period rose to \u00a3456.9m, an 8% increase on the same week in 2011. Despite reports from retailers and restaurants in London that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/07/retailers-olympic-boost-lacklustre-july?newsfeed=true\" title=\"Retailers fail to get Olympics boost in 'lacklustre' July\">business has been massively down on previous summers</a>, Visa said spending on its cards by tourists in restaurants across the country was up 19.6% last week to \u00a312.7m.</p> <p>It seems Usain Bolt hasn't been alone in hitting the capital's nightclubs, with Visa saying such spending among foreign cardholders was up 24% to \u00a32.1m last week. Despite the late nights, visitors are still finding time for sightseeing: card spending on attractions and exhibitions was up 12%, it said.</p> <p>A spokesman for Visa said there was a big uptake in domestic spending during the second half of the week as Brits realised you could travel into London and watch some Olympic events even without a ticket.</p> <p>American visitors splashed the most non-UK cash during the first week of the Games \u2013 \u00a358m \u2013 followed by Japanese tourists (\u00a330m) and French and Italian visitors, suggesting the euro crisis hasn't reduced all spending.</p> <p>Australians, boosted by their strong currency, have been hitting the capital's venues in big numbers, spending \u00a322.5m in the first week of the games.</p> <p>Last week, theatres and restaurants in London's West End complained about a huge drop in customers. Footfall was down almost 5%, while London mayor Boris Johnson admitted the Games were having a \"patchy\" effect on some businesses.</p> <p>Despite the increased spending, the Games still look to be falling behind expectations. A year ago Visa said consumer spending would soar by \u00a3750m during the Games, and deliver a sustained boost to the British economy of \u00a35.1bn.</p> <p>Spending in Olympic host countries is notoriously hard to predict. At the Sydney 2000 and Athens 2004 Olympics consumer spending was approximately half the forecast level for London 2012, while at the Beijing Games overseas visitors parted with just \u00a393m during the whole of the games.</p>",
  "<p>Mohammad Hanif is still trying to piece together the night his life changed for ever. One minute he was sitting down for dinner with his family at his home in the Maungdaw area of Burma's Arakan state. The next a mob wielding long knives and nail-studded clubs had burst through the door. Within minutes, two family members were dead. Within days the clan was separated, destitute and in flight [see footnote].</p> <p>\"They were our neighbours,\" said 65-year-old Hanif of the attackers who killed his son and son-in-law. \"They cut them down in front of my eyes \u2013 hacked at them the way knives slice through cabbage. We ran for our lives.\"</p> <p>Hanif, his wife and two daughters made for the jetty where they knew a boat was tied.</p> <p>\"My wife and younger daughter got separated and never made it to the boat,\" he said. \"We waited for them. But as the mob came nearer, we had to leave. It's been a month and I haven't heard from them. Maybe they're dead, maybe they're lost.\"</p> <p>Such tales are familiar in the remote fishing villages of south-eastern Bangladesh, where thousands of ethnic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/26/burma-rohingya-persecution-ethnic-violence\" title=\"Rohingya people Burma violence\">Rohingya</a> people, driven from their homes in neighbouring Burma, have been arriving since violence between the predominantly Buddhist Rakhine and the Rohingya \u2013 a Muslim minority with South Asian features \u2013 broke out in Arakan in early June.</p> <p>Most refugees carry horrifying accounts of murder, arson and rape perpetrated by Rakhine mobs, they say, with direct support from the administration. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates 80,000 people have been displaced by the violence in Arakan.</p> <p>Although both the Burmese and Bangladeshi governments say the violence has abated, fleeing refugees claim mass arrests and arson attacks aimed at driving out the Rohingyas continue.</p> <p>Bangladeshi authorities have refused to accept the refugees and have pushed back <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jun/29/burma-rohingya-refugees-bangladesh\" title=\"\">boatloads of Rohingyas</a>. Last week, Dhaka ordered three international charities helping Rohingya refugees with food and medicine \u2013 Doctors without Borders (MSF) and Action Against Hunger (ACF) as well as Britain's Muslim Aid UK \u2013 to stop operations immediately, arguing that they were creating a \"pull factor\" for refugees.</p> <p>Although the Bangladesh government claims the influx of refugees has stopped, the boats continue to come \u2013 mostly by night to avoid being arrested by Bangladeshi coast guard or shot at by Burmese border troops.</p> <p>Mohammad Hanif, his daughter Salma and five-year-old granddaughter Nafisa made it to Teknaf on Bangladesh's southeastern tip after spending two days in an open boat. Two attempts at landing were thwarted by Bangladeshi border guards, but the third attempt, under cover of darkness, succeeded. The three now hide in a ramshackle hut belonging to a fisherman who risks arrest by sheltering them.</p> <p>\"I've met people from my village who have fled here,\" said Hanif, squatting in the damp dirt-floor shack.</p> <p>\"The entire village was burnt down by Moghs [Rakhine] backed by Nasaka [Burmese border troops]. The government said it would protect us, but that was all talk. They want to exterminate us.\"</p> <p>On the run from the Bangladesh police and without any legitimate means of livelihood, Rohingyas face a bleak future on the Bangladesh side of the border. But that hasn't prevented Shah Noor, 23, from the Akyab area of Arakan state, from making the perilous trip along the Bay of Bengal to Teknaf.</p> <p>Noor, sheltering with a Bangladeshi fish trader he befriended two years ago, said he was sent to Bangladesh by his mother mid-July after police started rounding up young Rohingya men.</p> <p>\"I didn't want to leave but when the police arrived, she swore on her head that she couldn't bear to see me tortured,\" he said. \"So I ran away and hid in the bushes. The police told all the men to lie down and then they kicked them one by one. Many people have been arrested and turned over to Rakhine mobs.\"</p> <p>Such accounts are difficult to verify, since much of northern Arakan state is a no-go area for journalists and independent observers. But the refugees' claims are consistent with reports by human rights organisations such as <a href=\"http://amnesty.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Amnesty International </a>and <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/\" title=\"\">Human Rights Watch </a>that say security forces have targeted Muslim-inhabited areas following the riots. Rohingyas have been beaten, raped and killed by security forces and Rakhine Buddhists, according to <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/myanmar-rohingya-abuses-show-human-rights-progress-backtracking-2012-07-19\" title=\"\">Amnesty</a>.</p> <p>Burma declared a state of emergency on June 10,&#xa0;deploying troops to quell the unrest. But Human Rights Watch has accused the government of mounting a \"<a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/07/05/burma-mass-arrests-raids-rohingya-muslims\" title=\"\">brutal and biased police response</a>\". Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said the international community had been \"blinded by a romantic narrative of sweeping change\" in Burma.</p> <p>Rohingyas such as Hanif and Shah Noor accuse the government of fomenting the massacre by urging Rakhines to kill the Rohingya \"Kala\" (blacks) \u2013 an overtly racist strategy that turned neighbours into killers.</p> <p>They point out that many of the victims of the riots died of gunshot wounds, though the rioters were mainly armed with machetes and clubs. \"It was the government,\" Shah Noor said quietly. \"Without the military backing, the Moghs would never dare attack us. The government wants to drive us out.\"</p> <p>On 11 July, Burmese President Thein Sein suggested that the country could solve the problem by expelling all of its Rohingyas or by having the United Nations resettle them \u2013 a proposal that a United Nations official quickly rejected.</p> <p>Burma considers the Rohingya Muslims as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Bangladeshi officials say the geopolitical reality of the region makes that improbable.</p> <p>\"Why would any Bangladeshi move from his country where he is safe to where he is sure to be persecuted or killed because he has no rights there?\" asked one foreign ministry official in Dhaka, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p> <p>\"Since independence from British rule in 1947, Bangladesh has been more prosperous and open than Burma.\"</p> <p>The official pointed out that Burma had signed agreements with Bangladesh to take back refugees in 1979, 1994 and 2011.</p> <p>\"Voter lists of several elections in Burma in the last 50 years along with the agreements signed with the Bangladesh government prove that the Rohingya are citizens of Burma,\" he said.</p> <p>Mohammad Hanif says Arakan is the only home he knows.</p> <p>\"We hope the nations of the world will help us go back. We want the bloodshed to stop.\"</p> <h2>Harried people's roots<br></h2> <p>Brown-skinned with Bengali features, the Rohingya complain they have been persecuted for decades despite centuries-old roots in the region, owing to ethnic, religious and cultural differences with the mainstream Tibeto-Burman people.</p> <p>Experts say that the key to understanding the conflict lies in the unique history of Arakan, a medieval kingdom located at the edge of south Asia which became a province of Burma only after the Burmese invasion in 1784.</p> <p>While the Arakan Yoma mountain range creates a formidable barrier with the rest of Burma, Arakan is separated from the Chittagong region of Bangladesh only by the Naf river.</p> <p>\"People have been moving in both directions across the Naf throughout history,\" said Pamela Gutman, an academic at the University of Sydney, who is the author of several books on ancient Arakan.</p> <p>Although Islam came to the region with 8th century Arab traders, and the presence of Muslims in medieval Arakan is well documented, there is some evidence that Brahmanic people from Bengal may have established an ancient kingdom named Vaishali in north Arakan long before then.</p> <p>The Rohingya say they have inhabited the area of western Burma for centuries, pointing to the etymological link of Rohingya-Rakhine-Arakan.</p> <p>But in 1982, Burma passed a controversial <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/node/109177/section/8\" title=\"\">law that stripped them of citizenship</a>, in effect turning them into the \"Roma of Asia\".</p> <p>The United Nations says they are among the most persecuted people in the world.</p> <p>About a quarter of them \u2013 200,000 people \u2013 have crossed into Bangladesh in recent years to escape repression in Burma where the army has been accused of carrying out persecution since 1978.</p> <p>Perhaps the most graphic example of regional indifference to their plight was the incident four years ago in which the Thai military was accused of intercepting boatloads of migrants in the Andaman Sea, only to leave hundreds of them to perish on the water.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 8 August 2012.

  "<p>Let me start by saying that I am not a proponent of directing academics away from blue-sky research towards second-rate contract research for the highest bidder. I am passionate about the long-term economic, social and cultural value of intellectual exploration through curiosity-driven research. But there seems to be a commonly held view that if you wish to preserve academic freedom, it's impossible to provide any substantial economic benefit to the UK, and that attempting to do so will create profound damage to our research base. I simply don't buy that argument.</p> <p>The UK needs an economic game changer and we are incredibly fortunate to have a platform from which we can launch it \u2013 our universities. We already make a major contribution to GDP yet we can do much more if academics engage even more extensively with business. We should be using the base of our higher education sector to help our businesses innovate and grow, to encourage overseas corporations to invest in the UK and to create jobs for UK citizens. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/aug/02/the-value-of-research-collaborations\" title=\"\">Many academics already do collaborate with business</a>, recognising that it can enrich and enhance the quality of scholarly work. Such interactions will become increasingly important if we are to remain competitive in the global business that is higher education.</p> <p>The government started well in 2010 by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/oct/19/spending-review-science-budget-spared\" title=\"\">protecting the research budget</a> \u2013 a tall order but essential given that our competitors are investing much more into research. What is frustrating is we are not joined-up in using our assets for the best interests of the UK. Research activity generates highly trained staff, as well as data, knowledge, and intellectual property (IP), and we should use them to our competitive advantage. We all know the benefits of seeing new developments, from academics who attend the latest conference to see unpublished work to businesses who have always recognised the importance of technology adoption and first-mover advantage. Recognising the value to business of access to our research first is a no brainer.</p> <p>The question, then, is why, when we create some of the best knowledge and IP in the world, are we intent on pursuing initiatives such as <a href=\"http://www.easyaccessip.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Easy Access IP</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/jul/23/finch-report-open-access-research\" title=\"\">gold open access</a>, without giving due consideration to the benefits for our economy. I am not opposed to the underlying principles of these initiatives, but in some cases they are unnecessary and in others they are unlikely to work. At worst they could mean that, as a nation, we will spend more money, do less research and accrue less economic benefit for the UK. In my view, we can be smarter than this and use these assets as part of a package of measures to collectively make the UK the most attractive place for businesses committed to generating jobs and growth here.</p> <p>What then should we be doing? We should create a network of research and innovation enterprise zones across the nation; places where large corporations could work alongside SMEs and university researchers from across sectors, rubbing shoulders, exchanging ideas and researching and innovating together. This would generate exciting new discoveries and then ensure their transformation at lightning speed into products, jobs and growth in the UK, for the UK. I'm not simply talking about science parks \u2013 but genuine research and innovation accelerators, promoting inward investment on scale and generating thousands of jobs.</p> <p>The government would need to offer significant incentives to achieve this goal, perhaps including reduced corporation tax and flexibility on VAT to allow sharing of spaces. University researchers could make their research outputs preferentially available for a fixed period, perhaps alongside the embargo period of a <a href=\"http://www.ercim.eu/publication/Ercim_News/enw64/jeffery.html\" title=\"\">green open access policy</a>, providing an early view and hence opportunities for early uptake. We could also use these zones to pilot new ideas to liberate us from the stranglehold of red tape and burdensome regulation around employment law, immigration policies, procurement and others, which currently inhibit entrepreneurs and stifle growth.</p> <p>Finally, the main assets of our universities are our people. It is people who innovate, collaborate and discover, not institutions. We need to nurture this talent and to boost innovation through enabling academics to gain exposure to new and different techniques in different settings. We need to enable people from across universities \u2013 from professors, to post-docs and PhD students \u2013 to move more freely amongst different types of institutions than is currently possible. We could establish a scheme whereby high-fliers rotate around a selection of small business, larger companies and university research departments to gain a variety of experience to develop new ways of innovating.</p> <p>We are going to see profound changes in the next few years. The shift in economic power is clear and growing \u2013 and the signs are there for similar shifts in the global higher education market. We can chose to maintain a 19th century view of higher education, or we can recognise academic research can be enhanced by serious collaboration with external enterprises. We must be bold and recognise that the depth of our knowledge base provides a competitive advantage that most countries are desperately trying to emulate, because they know that it creates enormous economic, social and cultural value. We have the opportunity of a generation to build a sustainable economy for the 21st century \u2013 but we need to open our eyes and seize the opportunity.</p> <p><em>Professor Stephen Caddick is vice-provost (Enterprise) and Vernon professor of chemistry at </em><a href=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>University College London</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>When it comes to deciding which sector should deliver public services, savvy government reformers have moved on from \"private is always best\" (or \"public is always best\" for that matter ). Instead, they're more likely to say that it all depends on the circumstances.</p> <p>But although there is now a body of good practice about how to manage with private or non-profit providers once a public organisation has contracted or partnered with them, there is still got a long way to go in thinking about when a public body might use different providers.</p> <p>In our book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Rethinking-Public-Service-Delivery-Management/dp/0230237940\" title=\"\">Rethinking public service delivery: managing with external providers</a>, we spell out a better way to decide on whether a particular service should be delivered by an external provider.</p> <p>At first glance, our answer \u2013 that this should be when the benefits of doing so outweigh the costs \u2013 looks like conventional wisdom. But less conventional are what we identify as these benefits and costs to be.</p> <p>Typically, a decision to outsource a service is based on value for money: the expectation that an external provider can provide a better service at less cost. Although public agencies consider these factors diligently, we believe they could delve deeper into where any gains in value come from; not only the usual suspects of economies of scale, flexibility and specialisation, but also gains from collaboration such as complementary approaches, or learning and innovation.</p> <p>But there are other significant benefits and costs \u2013 mainly costs \u2013 that are being missed.</p> <p>First, there are relationship costs, which stem from the fact that there are two or more parties, that unlike an employment relationship, are at arm's length and want different things. The purchaser, for instance, may want a good service at a low price, while the provider wants to cut service corners and charge a higher price. In this context, someone has to define the service, choose who will do it and hold the provider to account for performance.</p> <p>These tasks cost time and money. They're significant when the service is hard to specify in advance \u2013 perhaps because it's unpredictable, like emergency services, or it's difficult to observe performance, like foster homes Or perhaps when it's just very complex, like psychiatric services. Costs can also be large where there's only one or no potential supplier \u2013 requiring the government to try to develop a market of providers.</p> <p>If it is hard to hold providers to account through the right mechanisms, then not only might they fail to deliver, but also they may take advantage of the situation, to the detriment of the service. This is especially true if private contractors are profit-seekers, which is precisely what we're relying on to motivate them to perform.</p> <p>None of these costs are reasons not to outsource services, but they are factors to be considered in weighing up whether to do so. But there also what we might call strategic costs \u2013 impacts on the strategic positioning or core competence of the organisation, beyond the service in question. For example, where a government organisation loses public trust or wider stakeholder support from association with a particular outsourcing arrangement or choice of provider. This occurred spectacularly with the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/public-leaders-network/2012/jul/13/g4s-olympic-public-service-contracting?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">G4S fiasco</a> which is reverberating in the public mind, not only in the UK but also in Australia, where the hiring of the same company by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation has caused controversy.</p> <p>A longer-term implication is where handing the service over to an outsider means the loss, diminution or alteration of a core competence of the public sector. Outsourcing the system architecture of big IT projects is one area where this has been a problem, leaving government purchasers less able to understand what providers are doing. The US Federal Protective Service has been criticised several times in <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-12-943T\" title=\"\">reports by the Government Accountability Office </a>for having divested itself of the capability to oversee the large contract guard force protecting 9,000 federal buildings.</p> <p>Also fraught with complexity is handing over the power to use legal authority or coercive force to external providers that provide security services, and who are subject to different incentives and accountabilities. There is much dispute about whether public power can be delegated, but it is noteworthy that the debates about the problems of private prisons or, in Australia's case, privatised immigration detention centres are mainly about incidents of the misuse of force.</p> <p>So instead of one best way, we propose that choices among different types of service provision for a given activity should be informed by guidance that acknowledges each situation is different.</p> <p><em>John Alford is professor of public sector management at the </em><a href=\"http://www.unimelb.edu.au/\" title=\"\"><em>University of Melbourne</em></a><em> and the </em><a href=\"http://www.anzsog.edu.au/\" title=\"\"><em>Australia and New Zealand School of Government</em></a><em> (Anzsgog).

Not because those clouds were too small to see, but because they were too big. The dawn of the satellite era changed that, revealing a type of cloud that scientists named 'actinoform.' The name of these radial, or leaf-shaped, clouds is based on the Greek term for 'ray.'  While actinoform clouds look appealing from space, on the ground they have proven less charming. Depending on the season, actinoform clouds can blow ashore, bringing gloomy, drizzly weather. In California, these cloud fields are associated with weather patterns nicknamed May Gray and June Gloom</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MODIS/Terra/NASA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394237847\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/6/1344253685369/Fires-in-Eastern-Spain-002.jpg\" alt=\"Satellite Eye on Earth: Fires in Eastern Spain\" width=\"600\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wildfires, Valencia, Spain: as water-bombing aircraft flew overhead, about 3,000 residents were forced to evacuate their homes.

A winding line of cliffs marks the park\u2019s northern margin, where Mount Nangar stretches 770m (2,530ft) above sea level. This park landscape has been a boon to native vegetation mostly because the rugged land was too much trouble for farmers and ranchers to clear.

  "<h2>Equestrian 10am<br></h2> <p>Monday saw Team GB win gold in the team showjumping, beating their Dutch rivals in a jump-off. Great Britain's Nick Skelton, Ben Maher, Scott Brash and Peter Charles won Team GB's first equestrian gold in London 2012 and the country's first showjumping gold in 60 years. Germany, who are currently dominating the sport's medal table, will try to extend their lead in today's individual dressage and the team dressage.</p> <h2>Diving 10am<br></h2> <p>The men's 3m springboard semi-final and final will take place in the Aquatics Centre. With China dominating the diving medal table as expected, the favourites to collect the gold are He Chong and Tom Daley's big rival, Qin Kai.</p> <h2>Track cycling 10am<br></h2> <p>This is the last day in the velodrome and it will host one of the most exciting and keenly anticipated events at the Games. Sir Chris Hoy races in the men's keirin final with a chance to grab his sixth gold medal. Sir Chris will be up against the second favourite, Germany's Max Levy, who took silver behind the Scot in the World Track Championships in April. So far Britain have dominated in the velodrome and the golden performances look set to go on right to the end.</p> <h2>Athletics 10am<br></h2> <p>The athletics continues with the qualification rounds in women's javelin, the men's triple jump and women's long jump. There will be first rounds of the men's 110m hurdles, women's 5,000m and men's 200m, as well as semi-finals in the men's 800m and women's 200m and finals in the men's high jump, men's discus and men's 1500m. Team GB's Goldie Sayers competes in the women's javelin and her compatriot Andrew Osagie will attempt to sail through the men's 800m semi-finals.</p> <h2>Triathlon 11:30am<br></h2> <p>Saturday's women's triathlon, which saw Britain's world champion Helen Jenkins finish fifth, drew large crowds in and around Hyde Park. Today it is the men's turn. Great Britain have not won a triathlon medal since the sport was introduced at the Olympics at Sydney in 2000. The brothers Jonathan and Alistair Brownlee are favourites and are hoping to end that sequence on home soil. The world No1 Alistair and the world No2 Jonathan \u2013 at 22 the younger by two years \u2013 have been warned by the sport's world governing body they will be disqualified if they try to cross the finish line simultaneously in an act of brotherly love.</p> <h2>Beach volleyball 6pm<br></h2> <p>After battling their way out of the group stages to the semi-final, April Ross and Jennifer Kessy of the USA will play Brazil's Juliana Silva and Larissa Franca, below, who have not lost a set so far. China also play another USA duo, dubbed the \"queens of the beach\" \u2013 Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh Jennings \u2013 for a chance to compete in the final and prevent an all-American showdown.</p> <h2>Football 5pm<br></h2> <p>Having beaten Stuart Pearce's Team GB on penalties, South Korea now face Brazil \u2013 who have never won the Olympic gold medal \u2013 at Old Trafford at 7.45pm. Brazil look favourites after scoring 12 goals in four games. The first of the day's matches sees Mexico against Japan at Wembley. Mexico will be hoping Tottenham's Giovani Dos Santos can continue his fine Olympic form.</p> <h2>Brits to watch<br></h2> <p><strong>Phillips Idowu</strong></p> <p><strong>Athletics, triple jump</strong></p> <p><strong>10.45am</strong></p> <p>Phillips Idowu finally begins his hunt for gold in the men's triple jump qualification today. Idowu has been a source of mystery since before the Games began after it was thought he was \"missing\". However, he reassured fans saying: \"I'm in London where I have been for the last few weeks, finalising my prep and receiving therapy.\" Idowu arrived at the athletes' village yesterday, quashing rumours that an injury would end his London 2012 dream. He grew up in Hackney, a stone's throw from the Olympic Stadium, and it is there he will strive to obtain gold after a 5cm difference from Nelson Evora pushed Idowu to the silver medal position at the Beijing Olympics four year ago. He has won world and European championships in recent years.</p> <p><strong>Victoria Pendleton</strong></p> <p><strong>Cycling \u2013 Track, sprint </strong></p> <p><strong>4.00pm</strong></p> <p>Victoria Pendleton's gold in the women's keirin helped to make up for her disappointment at being disqualified from the team sprint, despite setting a world record. Today could see Pendleton pick up her second gold of London 2012 in the individual sprint. She won gold in this event in the 2008 Beijing Olympics, making her the defending champion this time. In the course of qualifying Pendleton smashed the Olympic record with a personal best time of 10.724sec. The 31-year-old's most serious rival is Australia's Anna Meares, who came second in the heat, and the two will meet again if both reach the final of this event. Pendleton is retiring after London 2012 and nothing would give her a better send-off than another gold medal.</p> <p><strong>Lawrence Okoye</strong></p> <p><strong>Athletics, discus</strong></p> <p><strong>7.45pm</strong></p> <p>Relatively unknown but tipped to be a star, Lawrence Okoye is 20 years old but finds himself in the final of the discus in his first Olympics. He was not among the favourites to go through but threw 65.28m with his final throw of qualification. Okoye is the British record holder in the event after throwing 68.24m at the Hallesche Werfertage meeting in May this year. He also won gold in July last year at the European Under-23 Championships. Okoye has deferred his place at Oxford University to study law in order to give athletics his undivided attention. He said: \"The two years I've spent doing this would have gone down the pan if I didn't get through.\" Okoye has a chance of getting a medal if he can throw close to his best today.</p>"
