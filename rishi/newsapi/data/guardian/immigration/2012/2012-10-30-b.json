  "<p>Like the huge crane dangling precipitously above Columbus Circle in a New York City, the 2012 election has been left hanging by Hurricane Sandy, bringing the presidential campaign to a halt and silencing the chorus of polls and forecasts that had dominated the news until a few days ago.</p> <p>But while Sandy has dominated the nation's TV screens, away from the eastern seaboard it has been more like politics as usual. Both the Romney and Obama campaigns have been quietly revising their plans and plotting new strategies as the clock ticks down to polling day on 6 November, while congressional candidates have continued to grapple with their opponents in key Senate and House races around the country.</p> <p>Here's the biggest political news you may have missed while Sandy was doing its worst.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Both presidential campaigns largely suspended active campaigning by their candidates</strong>, with Barack Obama staying in the White House and Mitt Romney electing to hold hybrid \"storm relief\" events with supporters instead, offering to collect donations of dry goods for those in the affected areas. But by Tuesday afternoon, as the flood waters receded on the east coast, <a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/blog/memo-pennsylvania\">the Romney campaign announced an event</a> by the Republican candidate in Florida, suggesting that it was eager to return to full-throated campaigning as soon as possible.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The biggest political move of the week may be the Romney campaign's decision to throw resources into Pennsylvania</strong>, often seen as a solidly Democratic state but one which has lately shown less enthusiasm for Obama and Bob Casey, the Democratic senator struggling for re-election. After a long silence, the pro-Romney Super Pacs Crossroads and Restore Our Future have committed millions of dollars to the state, while the Romney campaign itself has been buying ad time for the last two days before the election, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/burns-haberman/2012/10/romney-starts-reserving-time-in-pennsylvania-for-last-147690.html\">Politico reports</a>.</p> <p>While Democrats dismissed the Romney move as a head-fake, the Romney campaign points out: \"Over the past few years we have seen Pennsylvania voting for a Republican senator and a Republican governor, and Republicans win control of the state house in addition to the state senate.\"</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Both campaigns suspended some advertising on the east coast but further inland the ad wars continued</strong>. The Romney campaign debuted an controversial attack ad in Ohio, claiming: \"Obama took GM and Chrysler into bankruptcy and sold Chrysler to Italians who are going to build Jeeps in China. Mitt Romney will fight for every American job.\" With Chrysler's Jeep production line a major employer in Toledo, Ohio, <a href=\"http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20121028/POLITICS01/210280314\">fact-checkers leapt on the ad's claim</a>, and Chrysler itself released a statement: \"Jeep has no intention of shifting production of its Jeep models out of North America to China.\"</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>While Obama stayed near the Rose Garden, his high-profile surrogates Bill Clinton and vice-president Joe Biden made campaign appearances in Florida and Ohio</strong>. The pair made a combined apearance in Youngstown, Ohio on Monday, and both made heavy criticism of Romney's claims about Jeep production being moved to China.<a href=\"http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/2012/oct/30/biden-clinton-team-up-at-ohio-campaign-stop/\"> Clinton offered his own pungent interpretation of Chrysler's response</a>: \"That's the biggest load of bull in the world that they would ever shut down American operations.\"</p> <p>Biden said the Romney claims were bizarre: \"This guy pirouettes more than a ballerina.\"</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Minnesota may join Pennsylvania in being transformed into a battleground state during the last few days of the election campaign</strong>. Both the Obama and Romney teams had been buying advertising in the usually solid blue state but the news that <a href=\" http://www.startribune.com/politics/national/176263801.html\">Bill Clinton would campaign in the state on Tuesday</a> was a sign of Democratic nervousness. The former president attracted a crowd of 1,800 to his event at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, with a later rally planned in Duluth.</p> <p><a href=\" http://www.dl-online.com/event/article/id/70854/group/homepage/\">Clinton also campaigned in Fargo, North Dakota</a>, for Heidi Heitkamp, the Democratic candidate for the US Senate who is running a surprisingly strong campaign. But despite Clinton's presence, Obama was only mentioned once at the rally in the heavily Republican state.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Opinion pollsters have been hampered by the impact of Sandy</strong>, both in contacting voters in swing states directly affected and because their own call centres \u2013 concentrated in New Jersey in several cases \u2013 have been compromised by the storm. Gallup and Rasmussen both suspended their daily tracking polls for the duration of the storm. But those polls that have been done continue to show exactly what the pre-storm polls revealed: a close race between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama.</p> <p>A Pew Research national poll released on Monday had Obama and Romney tied on 47%. Another national poll, for NPR, also found a presidential race tied at 47% apiece, but showed a 50%-46% advantage to Obama in the battleground states of Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Virginia, North Carolina and Florida.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Mitt Romney's previous comments about reforming or cutting Fema have been thrust into the spotlight by Sandy</strong>. In a GOP presidential primary debate, Romney appeared to say that Fema should be abolished and its funds provided to individual states or the private sector for disaster relief. Asked repeatedly by journalists to discuss Fema at his storm relief event in Ohio on Tuesday, Romney gave no response.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The closely-fought Senate election between Scott Brown and Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts suffered from Sandy, after the final debate between the two was cancelled</strong>. Two new polls this week show it continues to be a neck-and-neck contest: a Boston Globe poll on Monday had Brown moving into a slender 45%-43% lead among committed voters, while a Suffolk University poll on Tuesday has Warren leading by 53% to Brown's 46%.</p>",

  "<p>It was an unusual debut for international boxing. The ring was in a plush hall built for meetings of Afghanistan's tribal elders, the audience waved signs saying \"we want peace\" and there were no beer stands or women in skimpy outfits.</p> <p>But Kabul was wild with excitement about hosting the country's first professional boxing match, with one of their own, Afghan-German boxer Hamid Rahimi, as the odds-on favourite to become World Boxing Union middleweight champion in a match billed as a \"fight for peace\".</p> <p>In a city with little entertainment and almost no world-class sports, fans had dug out savings and sold prized possessions to buy tickets that started at $60 \u2013 the equivalent of two weeks' salary for many in the capital \u2013 and went up to $150 for fake leather VIP seats, their arms still wrapped in plastic. \"I had to sacrifice my iPhone to buy the ticket,\" said 25-year-old Essaq, a salesman and amateur wrestler from northern Afghanistan, joining the crowd for a match organisers said was beamed live to 52 countries.</p> <p>Before the bout the crowd roared \"God is Great\" when asked to pray for Rahimi's victory, and nearly drowned out a video message from the fighter with cheering. \"This was my biggest wish, to have a match in my own land,\" he told them. \"In Germany when I was talking to people about having a professional boxing match here they laughed at me and said, 'There's a war there, it's impossible'.\" His opponent, Tanzanian Said Mbelwa, sat through a string of tributes to Rahimi and Afghanistan, and then a half-hearted welcome.</p> <p>With the partisan crowd cheering him on, Rahimi was dominating by round four and in the seventh round claimed the gold belt with a blow to Mbelwa's shoulder that put him out of the fight.</p> <p>Rahimi fled his country two decades ago, when it hovered on the brink of civil war. The family settled in Germany and the young refugee discovered his talent when he stood up to bullies at his new school. He has won all but one of his professional matches, but always dreamed of coming home.</p> <p>This year he ventured back to Kabul to plan the \"fight for peace\", with his mother Fatima, who had been deputy head of a school in the capital, and his brother Waheed. They were devastated by the damage war had done to their country and its people. The beggars crowding the city streets reduced Waheed \u2013 as tough and muscled as his younger brother \u2013 to tears. \"I have two young boys, and it made me cry to see children their age on the street,\" he said, as he helped his brother prepare for the match in a high-end hotel. For many of the children and teenagers packed into the hall to see Rahimi claim his title and then dedicate it to Afghanistan, the evening was one of the best of their lives.</p> <p>\"I have been so excited all day I couldn't eat,\" said 14-year-old Asef Abdullah. \"And I know I will be awake all night now.\"</p> <p>There was some grumbling about the organisation, as ticketholders were kept waiting up to an hour by police in riot uniform, and excited fans stormed the ring after the match. But strict security searches meant the evening was peaceful, and the image beamed to the world was of Afghans fighting only in the ring, and celebrating outside it. \"Since I realised Rahimi won, I haven't stopped dancing,\" said Jamal, a teenager doing a victory stomp on the street outside the venue. \"I will never forget this night.\"</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Mokhtar Amiri</em></p>",
  "<p>From his beginnings in jazz, folk and soul music onwards, the singer and guitarist Terry Callier, who has died aged 67 after suffering from throat cancer, struggled to find the popular recognition his varied talents deserved. Nonetheless he released a string of enduring and influential albums and, during the 1990s, enjoyed a creative rebirth in the UK when his supple, soulful music was feted by the acid-jazz movement and he collaborated with Beth Orton and Massive Attack.</p> <p>Callier was born in Chicago and raised in the north side of the city. Partly inspired by his mother's enthusiasm for singers such as Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday, he sang in amateur doo-wop groups in his teens, and found himself in the midst of a remarkable group of local musicians including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/dec/28/guardianobituaries\" title=\"Curtis Mayfield obituary\">Curtis Mayfield</a>, Jerry Butler and <a href=\"http://www.ramseylewis.com/\" title=\"Ramsey Lewis's official website\">Ramsey Lewis</a>. </p> <p>In 1964, he was signed to Prestige Records by the producer Samuel Charters, with whom he cut his first album, The New Folk Sound of Terry Callier. Featuring just an acoustic guitar, two bass players (an idea Callier borrowed from the jazzman John Coltrane) and Callier's gentle but hugely expressive voice, the album stands today as a minor masterpiece. However, it was not released until 18 months later because in the meantime Charters had disappeared to Mexico, taking the master tapes with him. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-gCKPw-l4\">Look at Me Now</a>, Callier's debut single, came in 1968, when he signed with Chicago's renowned blues label, Chess.</p> <p>Callier earned a living by playing gigs in New York and Chicago until he was contacted by Butler in 1970 and recruited to his salaried group of songwriters. \"Our job was just to write songs and learn about the music business,\" Callier <a href=\"http://www.angusbatey.com/index.php?id=524&amp;category=features&amp;PHPSESSID=bc8a0ff538ec5329ec431b91b1fe4b17\" title=\"Interview with Terry Callier\">told the journalist Angus Batey</a>. \"That was incredible.\" The following year, the Chess producer Charles Stepney approached Callier for songs. Callier supplied The Love We Had (Stays On My Mind), which was recorded by the Dells and was successful enough to prompt a recording contract for Callier from the Chess subsidiary Cadet. He made three solo albums under Stepney's guidance: Occasional Rain, What Color Is Love and I Just Can't Help Myself; commercial reward did not match their critical acclaim and Cadet ended Callier's contract.</p> <p>Hope was rekindled when Elektra Records came calling in 1977, though Callier refused to have any truck with the prevailing disco boom, and his two Elektra albums continued his string of commercial flops. His Elektra mentor, Don Mizell, quit the label in 1979, and Callier was dropped shortly afterwards.</p> <p>When his daughter, Sundiata, who was living with Callier's ex-wife, told him she wanted to stay in Chicago to attend school, Callier realised he had to have a steady income. \"She needed me and the music business just didn't seem like a viable option at that point,\" he said. He secured a staff job as a computer programmer at the University of Chicago, and relegated music to a mere hobby for the next decade and a half.</p> <p>However, as the 90s dawned, Callier was amazed to be told that he had become an icon of the British soul-jazz scene, thanks to a single, I Don't Wanna See Myself (Without You), on an obscure label. This had caught the ear of cutting-edge DJs such as Eddie Piller, who dropped in on Callier in Chicago and invited him to perform at the 100 Club in London. His subsequent string of shows at the Jazz Cafe became legendary for the devotion he aroused in his listeners.</p> <p>Callier sang two songs with Orton on her EP Best Bit and he was signed to Gilles Peterson's Talkin' Loud label, for which he cut the albums Timepeace (featuring Orton) and Lifetime, both suffused with a sense of faith and yearning for redemption. After his record deal collapsed following a round of record company mergers, the independent label Mr Bongo stepped into the breach and released the live album Alive and a studio album, Speak Your Peace, which featured a duet performed and co-written with Paul Weller.</p> <p>Callier was sacked from his computer programmer's job and concentrated once more on music, dividing his time between the UK and the US. He recorded six acclaimed albums between 1999 and 2009. The last of these was Hidden Conversations, on which he was joined by Massive Attack, with whom he had collaborated on the single Live With Me, a Top 20 hit in 2006. \"You can make accessible music and still sing about love and peace and truth and life and death,\" said Callier in 1996. \"In the end, those are the only things that matter.\"</p> <p>He is survived by his daughter.</p> <p>\u2022 Terry Callier, musician, born 24 May 1945; died 28 October 2012</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 31 October 2012. The New Folk Sound of Terry Callier was released 18 months after it was recorded, rather than four years. Callier signed with Chess in 1968, rather than 1963.</p>",
  "<p>BP has rewarded \"very patient\" shareholders and pension funds buffeted by the group's travails in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon disaster with a double-digit increase in its dividend.</p> <p>A week after announcing the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/22/bp-rosneft-deal-27-billion-dollars\" title=\"\">$27bn (\u00a317bn) sale of its 50% stake in Russian business TNK-BP</a> to the Kremlin-controlled Rosneft, the British oil group said it would increase its third-quarter dividend to 9\u00a2 a share \u2013 a rise of 12.5% \u2013 in a move that goes some way to reasserting BP's status in pension fund portfolios. At its height, the BP investor payout accounted for \u00a31 in every \u00a36 of FTSE 100 dividend payments. But even at 9\u00a2 it remains below its pre-Deepwater level of 14\u00a2 in 2010, after which it was suspended for three successive quarters until its reinstatement in early 2011 at half its previous level. BP shares closed 4.2% higher at 442.85p. The stock remains about 30% below the 658p level that it was trading at shortly before the world's worst offshore spill, which saw 4.9m barrels of oil gush into the Gulf of Mexico.</p> <p>BP's chief executive, Bob Dudley, said the dividend move was a reaction to the Rosneft deal, the development of new oil and gas prospects, and a post-Deepwater disposal programme that has nearly reached its $38bn target.</p> <p>\"We recognise that we have had some very patient shareholders. It is a combination of divestments, projects coming on stream and some clarity in Russia, that gave the board the confidence to reward our shareholders this quarter,\" he said. At 14\u00a2 a quarter the BP dividend contributed around $10bn a year to pension funds, with the new 9\u00a2 representing an annualised payment of about $6.8bn.</p> <p>The National Association of Pension Funds, which represents 1,300 schemes with assets totalling \u00a3900bn, said it welcomed the move. \"BP is a big company and a key holding for investors, so this rise in their dividend will be welcomed by many pension funds. It is also an encouraging indicator of the long-term health of the company,\" said David Paterson, head of corporate governance at the NAPF.</p> <p>BP's third-quarter underlying replacement profit of $5.2bn \u2013 a figure that strips out fluctuations in oil prices \u2013 beat forecasts by more than $1bn, but represented a decline of 5% on the same period last year due to a number of divestments made by BP over the past 12 months.</p> <p>Dudley added that BP was undaunted by a succession of bruising encounters with Russian geopolitics, which include Dudley's experience as boss of TNK-BP in 2008, when he was forced to quit after an \"orchestrated campaign of harassment\". Dudley said: \"We have always had a good relationship with Rosneft&#xa0;\u2026 there is a very clear commitment to create and build a modern and efficient, world-class company.\" BP will emerge from the TNK-BP deal with an 18.5% stake in Rosneft. Acknowledging BP's fractious relationship with TNK-BP's co-owners, a group of oligarchs called AAR, he added: \"The relationship seems to have run its course and BP did not want to leave Russia.\"</p> <p>BP said its results were boosted by a strong performance in its downstream business, driven by improved profitability at its refining units, while its upstream business \u2013 oil and gas production \u2013 produced a similar performance to the previous quarter. BP's US refineries have struggled for profitability in recent years but problems at rival refiners, including Exxon's Beaumont facility, helped boost profits over the past three months. In the wake of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/bp-oil-spill\" title=\"\">Gulf of Mexico spill</a>, which has cost BP $38.1bn so far, the group has outlined a 10-point strategy that includes developing more profitable oil and gas fields. With that target in mind, the majority of BP's significant new projects that are due to come into production by 2014 are in four areas: the Gulf of Mexico, Angola, Azerbaijan and the North Sea. \"All of these projects are on track,\" said BP.</p> <p>As part of its post-spill strategy to slim down the group and raised compensation funds, BP has divested $35bn worth of businesses including $11bn in disposals since the second quarter, led by its Texas City and Carson refineries in the US. BP said it will make a \"final\" payment of $860m into a $20bn Gulf of Mexico compensation fund. Excluding that $20bn fund, the group has paid out $15bn in compensation and clean-up costs so far. However, it is still negotiating a settlement with the US department of justice over criminal and civil offences. BP said: \"Whilst [BP] is ready to settle on reasonable terms, a number of unresolved issues remain and there is significant uncertainty as to whether an agreement will ultimately be reached.\" According to reports, the DoJ could be seeking a settlement of at least $18bn, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/30/bp-oil-spill-settlement-talks-stall\" title=\"\">while BP is holding out for $15bn</a>.</p>",

I too met some of my favourite authors. &#xa0;</p> <p>Firstly there was Cressida Cowell - I've loved her books since How To Train Your Dragon came out, and my brothers all love her too: they have almost all of her books on audio CDs. &#xa0;</p> <p>Then there was Francesca Simon, who judged the prize a few years ago, who wrote the Horrid Henry books. &#xa0;Again, both I and my brothers love her \u2013 so it was amazing to hear that one of her greatest pleasures is to \"be enthusiastic about my readers\". &#xa0;</p> <p>And finally Jenny Valentine, whose book Finding Violet Park won in 2007, and who is one of my favourite contemporary writers. &#xa0;I'm an aspiring author and when Jenny found out I have a trilogy living in my head she told me to come to her for writing advice. &#xa0;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398676479\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/30/1351614286255/Frank-Cottrell-Boyce-and--001.jpg\" alt=\"Frank Cottrell Boyce and his prize\" width=\"220\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frank Cottrell Boyce meets his double Photograph: Megan Quibell </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Megan Quibell/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I found a new idol in Frank Cottrell Boyce. Who could fail a winner who cut into the special celebration cake, with a cry of: \"Die cake!\"&#xa0;</p> <p>But the final word goes to Carl Hunter, who worked with Clare Heney on the illustrations for The Unforgotten Coat.&#xa0;We were talking about how the book had originally been written for the Readers Organisation, a charity whose aim is to promote reading and the joy of books, taking them into places like prisons and hospitals. </p> <p>\"Stories spark debates\", said Carl, which is important because \"silence can be an enemy\". &#xa0;</p>",
  "<p>As a teenager No\u00e9 Diakubama made a sketch map of Mbandaka, on the Congo river, so as not to get lost in the forest while picking a vegetable called fumbwa. \"I remember never having seen a map of the city,\" he says.</p> <p>Thirty years later, maps of the city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are still in short supply. So Diakubama decided to create the first one of his home city. He spent hours at his computer in Brussels, where he now lives, using <a href=\"http://www.google.com/mapmaker?hl=en&amp;q=Mbandaka&amp;gw=30&amp;ll=0.046949,18.263483&amp;spn=0.041456,0.074244&amp;z=14\" title=\"\">Google Map Maker software</a> and entering the streets he could recall. He hired an assistant to tour Mbandaka by bike and name the streets on a map scanned in pdf format and printed out.</p> <p>Diakubama's efforts have been replicated across Africa by scores of amateur mapmakers who have collectively pinpointed hundreds of thousands of roads, cities and buildings in remote areas ignored by colonial cartographers. This is just one example of how the digital revolution has not only caught up in Africa, but is in some respects moving faster and differently from the west.</p> <p>\"New technologies are in the process of transforming the lives of people,\" Diakubama said. \"Mobile telephony has equipped our lives by allowing communication between cities and villages without having to move; to announce a death in the family, for example.</p> <p>\"Mobile telephony is a true revolution in a country where the landline was restricted to a few families.\"</p> <p>In Africa, necessity is the mother of invention. Instead of sharing photos on Instagram or hobbies on Pinterest, you are more likely to find a service to send money to a rural relative, or to monitor cows' gestation cycle, or for farmers to find out where they can get the best price for their goods. Technology in Africa is foremost about solving problems rather than sharing social trivia, about survival rather than entertainment \u2013 although these are flourishing too.</p> <p>South Africa hosts the third annual <a href=\"http://tech4africa.com\" title=\"\">Tech4Africa conference</a>, in Johannesburg on Wednesday, attracting innovators and entrepreneurs from a dozen countries. Among the speakers are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Simdul\" title=\"\">Sim Shagaya</a>, a Nigerian-born Harvard graduate planning to create the \"Amazon of Africa, selling Lagos's increasingly affluent consumer class everything from refrigerators to perfume to cupcakes\". His previous venture, <a href=\"http://dealdey.com/\" title=\"\">DealDey</a>, which offers Groupon-style deals, is now the top-grossing ecommerce site in Nigeria with 350,000 subscribers.</p> <p>The forum will also be addressed by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Mbwana\" title=\"\">Mbwana Alliy</a>, the Tanzanian founder of an Africa-focused technology venture capital fund, and Verone Mankou of Congo-Brazzaville, who designed a tablet computer that sells for a third of the price of the iPad. Mankou, 26, has also launched an African smartphone, the Elikia, which means \"hope\" in the Lingala language.</p> <p>Tech4Africa is the brainchild of Gareth Knight, a 35-year-old South African based in London. \"If you remember in Britain in 2002-4, you would see the vans for ISPs (internet service providers) installing broadband,\" he said. \"Everyone was getting online even if they still had to use an internet cafe.</p> <p>\"What happened in the UK and US at the turn of the century is now happening in Africa on the mobile platform. It's being driven by social and commercial utility needs \u2013 for example, when people want to send money. The market is much bigger than the original one in the UK and US. More and more people are going to get online in the next couple of years and they'll want all the same things.\"</p> <p>In the world's poorest continent, only one in three people has access to electricity \u2013 but far more than that have a mobile phone. Africa is the fastest growing region for mobiles in the world, and the biggest after Asia, according to the GSM Association. There are now an estimated 700m sim cards in Africa.</p> <p>Mobiles overcome some of the endemic problems that have stifled progress on the continent: poor infrastructure (both in transport and power transmission), sparsely populated rural areas and widespread poverty.</p> <p>The basic feature phones that are still the most popular are vital for this environment. With small non-touchscreens, they have long battery life, though people find innovative ways to recharge, for example from car batteries.</p> <p>Most have an FM radio, still the greatest communications medium in the developing world. And many have a small torch.</p> <p>In east Africa, mobile money is used as frequently as paper money; the region accounts for four-fifths of the world's transactions. With text messages it is possible to send money to another mobile that can be cashed out of the system using tens of thousands of participating agents. It is estimated that half of Kenya's GDP moves through mobile money, mostly using the pioneering service M-Pesa, which has some 14m users.</p> <p>Mobiles have fostered communication like no other technology ever before, linking villages in a split second that would previously have taken days to reach on foot or by road. Information services via text message allow farmers to learn more about best practices, market prices and weather conditions. The unemployed can subscribe to text alerts about job vacancies instead of having to travel.</p> <p>Alan Knott-Craig, a 35-year-old South African tech entrepreneur, said: \"It's lighting up the dark continent. People are talking with each other. In the old days, you couldn't talk to your family if you were a migrant worker; now you can. The next level is money. When you light it up with money, you're giving people social freedom as well as economic freedom.\"</p> <p>Local entrepreneurs in hubs such as Accra, <a href=\"http://www.siliconcape.com\" title=\"\">Cape Town</a>, Lagos and Nairobi have the <a href=\"http://www.safaricom.co.ke/?id=257\" title=\"\">advantage</a> of knowing Africa's particular needs when competing with the Silicon Valley giants. Numerous social networks specifically for mobiles have sprung up, offering cheap or free communication for their users. Mxit and 2go from South Africa have 44m and 20m users respectively, the latter mostly in Nigeria. Others like Motribe and FrontlineSMS offer mobile communities.</p> <p>According to Internet World Stats, Africa still has the world's lowest internet penetration rate at 15.6%. Desktop PCs and tablets such as the iPad are relatively few and far between and have been leapfrogged by the more appropriate technology offered by the mobile. In conflict-riven Somalia, for example, fierce unregulated competition has made mobiles affordable and prevalent, whereas internet penetration stands at 1.14% of the population.</p> <p>Among Africa's broadband-linked minority, Facebook and Twitter, blogs and online magazines, music and video sharing sites, are thriving. That includes the political realm: atrocities that might once have been hidden by an authoritarian regime can be quickly exposed to a global audience, while the follies of leaders are held to scrutiny and mockery as never before. Shrewd politicians such as Rwandan president Paul Kagame have created their own accounts to remain connected and avoid the kind of mass mobilisation seen in the Arab spring.</p> <p>\"The mobile is going to bring in a huge amount of transparency and information sharing that Africa has never had before,\" said Knight. \"Socially and politically, that levels the playing field. People are not going to be able to say things that aren't true; propaganda won't work any more.</p> <p>\"I strongly believe this is the time when technology can make the most difference in people's lives. There are five- to nine-year-olds today who, by the time they are 20, will have technology so embedded that the old Africa won't exist for them.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 2 November 2012 because the original said \"Verone Mankou of the Democratic Republic of the Congo\".

  "<p>The UN's high commissioner for refugees, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has said that his agency has less than half the money it needs to look after hundreds of thousands of Africans driven from their homes by conflict and forgotten by the international community, and may have to start cutting its spending on education and repatriation.</p> <p>Guterres said that as international attention and sympathy had drifted away from Africa, the UNHCR had so far managed to keep its African operations going by using money saved by cutting overheads at its headquarters in Geneva, but those funds had run out.</p> <p>As the Syrian civil war has increasingly dominated the headlines, world attention has drifted away from intractable conflicts in Africa and the refugee populations they have created, Guterres said.</p> <p>\"All our African operations are substantially underfunded,\" he told the Guardian. \"In Chad, we have about 280,000 Darfurian refugees, not to mention the 60,000 refugees from the Central African Republic who are in the south of Chad. Four or five years ago, Darfur was very much under the attention of the international community. It was one of the best funded operations we had.\"</p> <p>By contrast, the UNHCR currently has only a quarter of the $177m (\u00a3110m) needed to provide for the refugees in Chad. Funds needed for emergencies in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Sahel are also severely undersubscribed. Of the $1.9bn required for refugees across the whole continent, only a third has been forthcoming from donors, a reflection of how the problem has slipped from the global agenda. To make up the shortfall, the UNHCR has been using funds freed by efficiency savings, but it is not a permanent solution.</p> <p>\"We have dramatically reduced our overheads. In Geneva we had a staff of 1,000 and now we have less than 700. That has allowed us to use un-earmarked money that might otherwise have been used in headquarters to be used in these forgotten emergencies,\" Guterres said. He added that that still left budgets far short of needs, and \"now we have exhausted all our reserves\" and the only alternative was to start cutting support to refugees.</p> <p>\"Obviously, if at a certain moment we are not able to maintain the same level of funding, we will have to start cutting a certain number of services, which is something we don't want to do, because it has to do with not only with basic needs of people but also their dignity,\" Guterres said. \"Of course, we will always maintain the life-saving activities but people \u2026 do not only need water and food and shelter. They also need education, and self-reliance in their life, and these are the sort of investments that are totally impossible, forcing us to restrain our activities to core life-saving and protection action, which is not what we want.\"</p> <p>The cuts will also mean an end to investment in the refugees' devastated home towns and villages that would have encouraged voluntary returns and thus a long-term decline in refugee numbers. Earlier this year, there were reports of the return of about 100,000 internally displaced people from camps inside Darfur to their home villages, but Guterres said there had been a very small decline in the number of Darfur refugees over the border in Chad.</p>",
  "<p>When Mad Men first arrived on our screens in 2007, it ushered in a nostalgic craze for 1950s pencil skirts and buttoned-up blouses. And, from Louis Vuitton to Topshop, the \"secretary\" look has remained popular over the last few years. This fashion originated in a time when there were few attractive career options open to women, but becoming a flight attendant was one of them. The cabin aisle quickly became a place for fashions \u00e0 la mode, and that tapered office look took to the skies as young women embraced the opportunity to get out of the typing pool and travel the world.</p> <p>The women serving the Don Drapers of the day their in-flight old fashioneds wore beige skirt suits, complete with <a href=\"http://www.uniformfreak.com/1delta.html\" title=\"\">pillbox hats and salmon-coloured scarfs</a> or, a couple of years later, <a href=\"http://www.uniformfreak.com/1united.html\" title=\"\">bright-red minidresses</a>. We know this because we can see them in Cliff Muskiet's vast collection of flight-attendant uniforms. The 47-year-old Dutchman has been collecting cabin-crew uniforms for more than 20 years, photographing them and putting them up <a href=\"http://www.uniformfreak.com/\" title=\"\">on his website</a>. The fashion world often turns to nostalgia for inspiration, and Muskiet's collection takes that obsession with retro style to a whole new level. He now has more than 1,000 pieces, from airlines as diverse as Air Burkina, Carnival and Wizz Air. Muskiet, who has himself been working as a flight attendant for KLM since 1987, explains his obsession over the phone from Amsterdam.</p> <p><strong>Where does your passion for flight attendants' outfits come from?</strong></p> <p>When I was five years old, I flew from New York to Amsterdam. I slept through the whole journey and was very disappointed when we arrived, as I couldn't remember anything [about the flight] at all. That's when my obsession with civil aviation was born. I collected everything, from food trays to used boarding passes. It was only later, when I was a teenager, that I got hold of my first uniform, a 70s KLM piece. That was the starting point of my collection.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>How do you get hold of new pieces? Do you just walk up to colleagues and ask them?&#xa0;</strong></p> <p>Usually, I just send emails to airlines asking for uniforms. I also get offered pieces, as the site has become a sort of advertisement for commercial airlines. And two months ago I was arriving at immigration in Dallas when I saw this American Airlines crew member wearing a scarf I really wanted to have. So I just told her who I was and asked for it. She took off the scarf and gave it to me. I guess it helped that I was wearing a uniform myself.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>What do you do with all these uniforms?</strong></p> <p>Whenever I get a new piece, I try to take photographs of it and to upload it on to my website as soon as possible. Then I pack up the uniform and store it at home.</p> <p><strong>You must have a pretty big house.</strong></p> <p>I live in a three-bedroom flat in Amsterdam. But, when you step into my apartment, you don't see any uniforms. I can get very creative in using space, storing the uniforms away in suitcases, boxes and closets, on top of closets or under my bed. But it is getting more crammed.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>What are the main ways in which uniforms have changed over the decades?</strong></p> <p>In the 40s and 50s the uniforms were mostly military style: tailored jackets, long skirts, dark colours. Back then, all uniforms looked very similar. In the late 60s there was a big change as the idea that \"sex sells\" took hold. Back then, the idea was that stewardesses should attract passengers. The uniforms got very short, with miniskirts and hotpants. You saw a lot of colours and patterns, red, purple, stripes and dots. From the 90s on, the flight uniforms have turned into business outfits. Today, they look far more professional and, actually, pretty boring.</p> <p><strong>Which is your favourite?</strong></p> <p>I like the uniforms from the late 60s, early 70s sporting psychedelic patterns and lots of colours. And most of them came with hats. I love hats; they are like the icing on the cake. They make a uniform complete.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Will you ever stop collecting?</strong></p> <p>All collectors share the same feeling: they always want to have more of something. It doesn't matter if it's stamps, coins or uniforms. I don't care if people think I am crazy. Whenever I obtain a new piece, it simply makes me happy.&#xa0;</p>",
  "<p><strong>Was it really a hurricane? </strong>No, by the time it made landfall in the US&#xa0;it had been reclassified to a post-tropical storm.</p> <p><strong>Why was it called </strong><a href=\"http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/tcp/Storm-naming.html\" title=\"\"><strong>Sandy</strong></a><strong>? That seems a very fey 1920s name for a hurricane/tropical storm.</strong> There are six lists of names for tropical cyclones in the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico and North Atlantic, with names chosen mainly for their pithiness. Sandy was on the 2012 list. But once a storm causes destruction on this scale, it is delisted. Like Katrina and Mitch, we have heard the last of Sandy.</p> <p><strong>How great was the death toll? </strong>In the US the number is put at 18 (though that may rise) \u2013 about the same number that died in the <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/news/the-great-storm-of-1987-25-years-on\" title=\"\">great storm of 1987</a> in the UK. Sandy has killed several times that number in Cuba and Haiti. Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005, led to more than 1,800 deaths.</p> <p><strong>How will Sandy affect the presidential election? </strong>Obama hopes that by flying back to Washington ahead of a rally in Florida and declaring a disaster, he will look presidential. Pundits reckon the storm has blown away&#xa0;any momentum his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, might have had. But it is also likely to deter early voters from turning out, and they tend to be disproportionately Democrat supporters.</p> <p><strong>Might the election have to </strong><a href=\"http://www.nj.com/us-politics/index.ssf/2012/10/could_hurricane_sandy_delay_th.html\" title=\"\"><strong>be delayed</strong></a><strong>? </strong>According to constitutional experts, this is a \"legal black hole\". It has never happened, and law-makers are eager to avoid a postponement, but some experts suggest states do have the right to delay if holding the election on the designated day (6 November) is problematic. If any did so, however, they could open themselves up to challenges by Congress. Given that there is still a week to go and the level of destruction appears to be containable, the odds are that no state will opt out.</p> <p><strong>Why did the lights in the </strong><a href=\"http://thewall.com/topics/51127-while-almost-everyone-else-is-dark-the-lights-are\" title=\"\"><strong>Goldman Sachs building</strong></a><strong> stay on while New York City hospital had to be evacuated when its back-up power system failed? </strong>Because Goldman Sachs is a global investment banking and securities firm, and a hospital is \u2013 in the last analysis \u2013 just a hospital.</p> <p><strong>What's happening to </strong><a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/10/29/how_sandy_hits_the_homeless/\" title=\"\"><strong>the homeless</strong></a><strong>? </strong>The New York City Department of Homeless Services relocated nine homeless centres, evacuated more than 1,000 people and made strenuous efforts to encourage the use of shelters, but some of New York's 50,000-plus homeless population preferred to take their chance on the streets, perhaps relying on reflected light from Goldman Sachs Tower.</p> <p><strong>Did the </strong><a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/10/30/uk-storm-sandy-crane-idUKBRE89S13X20121030\" title=\"\"><strong>dangling crane</strong></a><strong> next to the luxury apartment building near Central Park ever collapse? </strong>When last seen, it was still dangling. </p> <p><strong>Did no one think that a 50-metre-high crane might pose a risk? </strong>Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the crane had been inspected and deemed not to be a risk, but that God moved in mysterious ways. \"Just because it was inspected, that doesn't mean God doesn't do things or that metal doesn't fail.\"</p> <p><strong>What will the disaster cost? </strong>Storm damage is put at about $20bn, of which $8bn will be insured losses. Hefty sums, but only about a quarter of the cost of the damage wrought by Katrina.</p> <p><strong>How will the US economy cope? </strong>Rather well, bizarrely.

  "<p>I was fascinated by Hanna Rosin's article, Men: an endangered species? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/30/hanna-rosin-end-men-extract?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">(19 October)</a>. Rosin perceptively catalogued the changing roles of men and women both in the economy and in the home. But what I missed was any consideration of the effect that these changes have on children: the one group in our society that is voiceless and invisible. From the womb onwards it is the voices of men and women that we hear, not the voices of the children.</p> <p>The facts were spelled out by President Obama himself, a man who grew up without a father. In a speech on Father's Day 2008, he said: \"Children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime; nine times more likely to drop out of school and 20 times more likely to end up in prison.\" Fatherlessness is a serious problem in the newly emerging society so expertly mapped by Rosin. And for many children, actual fatherlessness is compounded by functional motherlessness as children are shuttled from bed to the childminder to school, back to childminder and back to bed.</p> <p>I am not arguing for the hopeless policy of putting the clock back, but for a more complete understanding of the roles of men and women that includes the needs and rights, not only of the adults, but of the people least able to make their voices heard, their children.<br><strong>Martin Down</strong><br>Witney, UK</p> <p>\u2022 What is Hanna Rosin saying? A number of things: a) women are making progress in all fields; b) men have difficulty coping with the change; c) in general, this is good. She is generally right \u2013 especially about the last. We certainly need more women in top places \u2013 both in politics and in the economy.</p> <p>But why are women so adaptable and men so inflexible? Rosin says that the nature v nurture question on this is unanswerable, but it is clear she is leaning towards the latter explanation.</p> <p>Alas, it turns out that although she mentions evolutionary psychology her view of it is rather simplistic. Evolutionary psychology points to the interaction between genes and the environment. There is a spectrum of traits and behaviours \u2013 from ones that are almost exclusively determined by genes to ones almost exclusively determined by society.</p> <p>Violence is one of the former. Rosin says that women are becoming more aggressive and even violent. Are they? Are we to assume they are going to overtake men at some point \u2013 as they have in the field of academic success? I do not think so.</p> <p>Mate preferences fall somewhere in between. Rosin says that there is an international market for spouses, with men looking for women with more traditional views. I would like to argue that the main reason behind this market is different: men use their higher status to find younger women from poorer countries.</p> <p>And what about women? Why is there no similar market for men \u2013 with the modern, successful women looking for different men? Could it be that despite their success, women are still looking for someone swooping in on a white horse?</p> <p>Rosin's last point that there is no \"natural order\", only the way things are, is the perfect expression of the moralistic fallacy. It suggests that things can change in any direction we would like \u2013 without constraints.</p> <p>Yet as the great EO Wilson once said, \"nature holds us on a leash\". There may be no natural order but there are natural predispositions. Would it not be great if culture and&#xa0;socialisation could rid us of our&#xa0;sweet tooth? Think about this next time you walk past an ice-cream shop.<br><strong>Nick Michelioudakis</strong><br>Athens, Greece</p> <p><strong>Cuban missile crisis</strong></p> <p>I was disappointed to read Richard Gott's article on the Cuban missile crisis <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/12/what-cuban-missile-crisis?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">(How Cuba won the missile crisis, 19 October)</a>, even though I agreed with everything he wrote. The problem was what he left out, which concerns US activities the previous year. The standard US account blames the Russians for an act of aggression when they began to install missile bases in Cuba in 1962. Kennedy is then presented as a heroic statesman who takes the world to the brink of nuclear disaster, but manages to avert a third world war by sheer determination.</p> <p>What the US account conveniently omits is the installation of US missile bases in Turkey and Italy the previous year. The Russians had protested about those installations \u2013 which are roughly the same distance as that from Cuba to the US. They described it as an act of aggression because it destabilised the balance of power between the two military systems. The US ignored those protests and went ahead. Seen in that context, the Cuban missile crisis was caused by the US, not by Russia.</p> <p>Luckily for all of us, reason won through and the crisis was resolved. The US achieved a propaganda victory and was able to peddle its distorted account of events. Anyone writing about those events should make sure to provide the proper context, to avoid perpetuating a misleading account.<br><strong>Les Reid</strong><br>Edinburgh, UK</p> <p>\u2022 At least Richard Gott does not say that the Cubans won the missile crisis. I initially sympathised with the revolution. But the sad fact is that Cubans had great freedom of inquiry and expression under Batista. Dissenters did not physically rot in harsh jails. Castro kept his freedom because of Batista's leniency.</p> <p>The American policy towards Cuba has only a marginal effect on its economy. The sad fact is that under Batista the Cuban economy was among the best in Latin America rather than among the worst under Castro. I regret that Kennedy double-crossed the Cuban exiles at the time of the Bay of Pigs and set them up for failure.<br><strong>Morton A Kaplan</strong><br>Chicago, Illinois, US</p> <p><strong>Hard burden of proof</strong></p> <p>The Jimmy Savile case has highlighted how the odds are stacked against victims.

Rape, like any crime, has to be proven \"beyond reasonable doubt\", failing which the accused is to be considered innocent. But what exactly does this mean?</p> <p>That hard evidence is required? Or that the victim's side of the story is more plausible than that of the accused? DNA testing is far from systematic; surveillance cameras are usually not available.</p> <p>Having served recently on jury service without much guidance as to how to interpret \"beyond reasonable doubt\", several jurors were unwilling to return a guilty verdict in the absence of hard proof.

  "<p>What do you picture when you hear the words \"Mexican beggar child\"? Is the child blond? Green-eyed? Does she have light skin?</p> <p>A Mexican family was recently at the centre of a national controversy over such questions. A young Mexican girl begging for money was photographed by a driver. Child beggars are sadly not an uncommon sight in Mexico \u2013 except that in this case, the girl was blond, green-eyed and very light-skinned. Feeling something was \"not right\" about that particular child, the photographer posted the picture to his Facebook timeline, telling his followers to <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/case-of-blond-girl-beggar-rescued-from-streets-strikes-nerve-in-mexico-activists-decry-racism/2012/10/27/82d6ea2e-205c-11e2-8817-41b9a7aaabc7_story.html\" title=\"\">\"spread this photo around\"</a>. He argued that something was clearly wrong because the girl's parents \"were brown\".</p> <p>For those who reposted the picture (and there were many \u2013 so much so that officials soon interceded) it is indeed apparently an aberration for brown people to give birth to light-skinned kids, rather than a fairly frequent situation in a country with a long history of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mestizo#Mexico\" title=\"\">cultural acceptance of interracial relationships</a>. It's also apparently not normal to see a blond beggar in a country where poverty is defined by \"brownness\". So it was only a sign of good community responsibility that thousands of people were willing to use social media to publicise this oddity. Or so we are to believe.</p> <p>As a result, the five-year-old child was put in an orphanage, and her mother was detained for two days (she was later released, and a birth certificate for the girl was handed over). Unsurprisingly, many Mexican activists have pointed to the racism running through this chain of events. None of the concern over the child's plight would be happening if the child had a different skin colour, they argue. The mother also would not have had her child removed so quickly if she was not native. The truth behind these statements have caused an uproar in the country and kickstarted a national debate \u2013 if Mexicans have long accepted and even found an honoured position for mixed-race relationships and people in their country, how on earth can they be racists?</p> <p>As the debate carried on in Mexico, many bloggers and social media users in the US have also jumped into the conversation. While we've rightfully condemned the latent racism that set a fertile ground for the situation to happen, it's also been far too easy to ignore the role the US currently plays in helping to normalise systemic criminalisation of mothers of colour generally \u2013 and Mexican mothers specifically \u2013 in both countries.</p> <p>The increase of anti-immigrant sentiment following 9/11 has created a hypervisibility of South American women's bodies, and their presumed ability to give birth. In the eyes of many, they are the brown-skinned, illegal, poverty-stricken ones who \"sneak\" over the border to <a href=\"http://articles.cnn.com/2011-02-07/us/arizona.citizenship_1_birthright-citizenship-illegal-immigrants-arizona-legislators?_s=PM:US\" title=\"\">\"drop anchors\" so they can get a \"free ride\" through life</a>. This hypervisibility extends to their parenting as well: Mexican mothers who are on welfare are <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/security/2010/03/09/175939/numbersusa-immigration-tea-party/?mobile=nc\" title=\"\">considered culpable of draining the system</a> of limited resources. Those who fight for their right to remain with their US-born children are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvira_Arellano#Impact\" title=\"\">considered to be \"exploiting\" the child</a>. Mothers who don't speak English are considered such bad parents, <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1918941,00.html\" title=\"\">they lose custody of their children</a>.</p> <p>In that regard, the US is not that different from Mexico. What would have happened if a Spanish-speaking, dark-skinned woman was driving to her job in Arizona with her blond light-skinned child in the back seat, and just so happened to be observed by somebody with a camera? Would the reaction of government authorities (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_SB_1070\" title=\"\">emboldened by SB 1070, deemed the strictest anti-illegal immigration measure in recent US history</a>) or thousands of social media users be any different in the US than it was in Mexico? My bet is that it wouldn't.</p> <p>Mexico has incredible problems with racism, and this story has helped to expose them, albeit at the expense of a young child and her family. But Mexico does not exist as a separate unrelated entity from the US. To truly understand those dynamics, we should scrutinise how the racism at play in the US interacts with the racism taking place in Mexico, and question our own understandings of \"race\" within the context of our own communities. This work begins with interrogating the image that springs to mind when you hear \"Mexican beggar child\".</p>",

The CEO of ConEd, Kevin Burke, said it was the \"worst storm in ConEd's history\" and that it would take three to four days to fix up the substation at 14th Street and FDR Drive, which failed so catastrophically late on Monday. Better news for Staten Island: three substations there are back online. At 11am today,&#xa0;780,000 customers were without electrical service.</p> <p>It's clear that New York City will remain paralysed for days to come: seven East River railway tunnels are flooded; the Holland, Queens, Midtown and Brooklyn-Battery tunnels are also inundated.

A row of six houses that once proudly faced out to the Atlantic has been decimated by the storm.</p> <p>One of the homes, a two-storey wood-panelled building painted pink, is missing almost its entire ground floor. On one side the front wall has been swept away. Inside furniture is entirely missing too, replaced by three feet of sand. The back wall is also gone, with the surge having swept clean through the house and across two gardens behind. The home only has one full supporting wall left and has been cordoned off by police.</p> <p>Bill Gleeson, a funeral home director, owns the home next door. He's lived there with his family since 1986. His home has been more fortunate, most of the walls are intact, although inside there are water marks up to 5ft high in places.

It allows him to appear presidential and casts Mitt Romney in a bit part .</p> <p>The praise from New Jersey governor Chris Christie for Obama over his handling of Sandy has been a big boost. The Romney campaign must be wondering what on earth Christie was thinking. It is one thing to acknowledge help from the White House but did he really have to go far as to describe this as \"outstanding\".</p> <p>Romney is the one on the defensive, reporters watching for whether he appearance at relief event in Ohio veers into campaigning.</p> <p>I spent an hour this morning speaking to Obama campaign workers on the ground in Iowa and other swing states in the Mid-West and West and they are unaffected by Sandy. They are going ahead as normal with campaign plans, stepping up, as scheduled, getting out the votes. This effort will intensify over the weekend, with volunteers working three-hour shifts from 8.00 am on Saturday through to 9pm and from noon to 9pm on Sunday.&#xa0;Predictions among some Obama campaign workers on the ground that Romney has North Carolina in bag, and will take Florida, Virginia and Colorado. Obama, they hope, will take Ohio, Iowa, Nevada and New Hampshire.</p> <p>Mitt Romney is to take a gamble by resuming campaigning on Wednesday. He has scheduled several campaign events in Florida: in Tampa, Coral Gables and Jacksonville. The danger for him is that people might not yet be ready by then to make the switch from focus on the storm to politics, and his speeches on the campaign trail may look petty compared with Obama still dealing with the storm aftermath from the White House.</p> <p><em>Ewen MacAskill in Washington DC</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-9b9c90e3-e0fb-455a-b23b-6a335342091f\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/30/1351615172227/2cbffcf6-7e87-4a88-8e37-9f09b6e4dd8f-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Barack Obama receives an update on the ongoing response to Hurricane Sandy on Tuesday, in the Situation Room of the White House.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama receives an update on the ongoing response to Hurricane Sandy on Tuesday, in the Situation Room of the White House.

Water and debris has choked the entrance right up to the tunnel's roof, with flotsam bobbing just beneath a sign warning drivers that the clearance height is 12 ft 7ins.</p> <p>A maintenance truck lies almost entirely submerged on the sliproad down to the tunnel. There was no sign of the water receding in the 20 minutes I spent there.</p> <p>Many buildings in this southernmost part of Manhattan were inundated by the storm surge. Along Water Street, which runs parallel to the East River waterfront, a fire crew surveyed the damage to their station. Windows were smashed and sandbags proved useless against the flow of water. Inside, uniforms were strewn about the floor, which was still damp.</p> <p>Mandatory evacuations were in place in this part of the city, one of the most vulnerable places to a storms surge.</p> <p>The water poured into the entrance to the Whitehall ferry terminal, which provides a connection to Staten Island.</p> <p>An MTA employee told the Guardian that at 7.30am water was \u201cup to the platform\u201d in the terminal. He said some of the tunnels running under the East River from Manhattan to Brooklyn were entirely full of water, from roof to floor. The MTA was unable to pump out water quick enough because equipment was affected by power outages.</p> <p>Most people had heeded the extensive warnings and these streets were largely clear before the storm hit on Monday. But some people were caught out by the severity of the flooding. A new-looking white BMW 3 series car had been carried down a street close to the ferry terminal and dumped askew, partly on the road and partly on the sidewalk. A door had apparently been forced open by the storm, and pools of dank-smelling water had accumulated in the passenger footwells.</p> <p>Most of lower Manhattan below 24th Street was without power Tuesday morning. In Midtown, the damage was less from flooding and more from high winds, with branches and other foliage lining the roads. In some places there had been minor scaffolding collapses and tiles had smashed to the ground.</p> <p>There is a large police presence: squad cars with flashing lights were crawling around Manhattan, although the clean-up operation did not seem to have kicked in by 11am and the police seemed mostly to be reporting damage and acting as reassurance.</p> <p><em>Adam Gabbatt</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-ff0efab7-a541-4d26-beb3-e07281a88354\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/30/1351612279741/95325abd-cb27-487d-9737-475f82845650-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Hurricane Sandy floods reach the street level of the flooded Battery Park underpass, which leads to the Brooklyn-Battery tunnel in New York.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Water reaches the street level of the flooded Battery Park underpass, which leads to the Brooklyn-Battery tunnel in New York.

Riverside Park had a few downed trees, but the inconvenience was more caused by the downed branches, that numerous joggers jumped over as they went for their morning runs.</p> <p>Doormen and supers were hard at work hosing leaves from the sidewalks and curbs in front of their buildings. Some even had the time to put up Halloween decorations in their buildings lobbies.</p> <p>On Broadway, some stores lost their signs, which blew off in the wind.

This morning the man once seen as a likely Republican vice presidential pick has called president Barack Obama \u201coutstanding\u201d and blasted suggestions that his state would make a great photo op for Mitt Romney.</p> <p>New Jersey has been hit hard, three people have lost their lives so far to the storm, 2.4m people are out of power and levees have broken in northern New Jersey leaving at least four towns with up to 6ft of water. And Christie has no time for politics.</p> <p>\u201cI have to say, the administration, the president, himself and FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate have been outstanding with us so far,\u201d Christie said on ABC\u2019s Good Morning America. \u201cWe have a great partnership with them.\u201d</p> <p>Obama called on Christie Monday night, the governor said, and offered to help in any way he could. New Jersey has now been declared a major disaster area, opening up government funding for recovery efforts.</p> <p>\u201cI want to thank the president personally for his personal attention to this,\u201d said Christie.</p> <p>On Fox News host Steve Doocy made a pitch for a Christie/Romney photo op in some disaster-stricken New Jersey&#xa0;\u201cOver the last couple of months, you have appeared throughout the country, governor, on behalf of Mitt Romney,\u201d Doocy said. \u201cWe hear that perhaps Mr Romney may do some storm-related events. Is there any possibility that governor Romney may go to New Jersey to tour some of the damage with you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have no idea, nor am I the least bit concerned or interested,\u201d Christie snapped. \u201cI\u2019ve got a job to do here in New Jersey that\u2019s much bigger than presidential politics and I could care less about any of that stuff.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have a job to do,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ve got 2.4 million people out of power, I\u2019ve got devastation on the shore, I\u2019ve got floods in the northern part of my state.

The rivers are going down. In general the departments have put down the vigilance, it was red, now it is normal. They are trying to repair the roads and bridges that collapsed.</p> </blockquote> <p>He said the most serious impact of the storm had been on agriculture - the loss of crops and livestock. Christian Aid was going out at the moment to see what the state and other organisations were not able to provide, \u201cand to provide what is missing\u201d. They would be helping repair houses, replace livestock and provide seeds.</p> <p>Asked about the government\u2019s response, he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To be honest I think this time they did what they could, because they managed to put more than 20,000 people in temporary shelter, but in total you have 200,000 people that were affected by Sandy. That means there is a huge gap. We think we could provide some support to complement what they are doing.</p> </blockquote> <p>What could the government do differently?</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Christian Aid [is pushing] the government to take the environment situation more seriously, because if the country had the right trees, the right forests in place, I think that could help. It\u2019s really important for them to prioritise this in their future budget, for example. The Ministry of Environment in Haiti has 0.65% of the budget. I don\u2019t think it is normal.

We had tremendous amounts of water, tremendous amounts of flooding, severe winds, and we\u2019re seeing those effects across the country, with damaged homes, flooded homes, people displaced, crops and gardens destroyed and lives lost: 52 lives were lost, and it\u2019s extremely heartbreaking.</p> </blockquote> <p>She said she had just got off the phone to a friend whose colleague lost his entire family in a landslide that destroyed their home with his family inside.</p> <p>Van de Wetering explained how Tearfund was helping to respond to the disaster: since the earthquake of 2010 and Hurricane Isaac last year the charity had been helping repair homes and \u201cto address some of the agriculture and livelihood issues\u201d, especially in the rural mountains. \u201cNow Hurricane Sandy has created even more need and to be sure this response will also be addressing the needs of some of those people who now find themselves in a very difficult situation.\u201d</p> <p>I asked her to explain how Sandy had caused problems in terms of food shortages.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We can look at the context prior to both tropical storm Isaac and Hurricane Sandy with increasing food prices and food insecurity throughout the last several months. With tropical storm Isaac and now Sandy a lot of the crops have been destroyed. There are numerous crops that were ready for harvesting that have now been destroyed. Plantain trees and plantations ripped down, gardens flooded, and so in a country that primarily supports itself agriculturally, this is an extreme hit to the country.</p> </blockquote> <p>There would now be an increase in food prices and \u201cfood insecurity\u201d, with families finding it more difficult to harvest or sell their crops, she said. This would make it more difficult for them to send their children to school or repair their homes. Flooding and damaged homes were an immediate problem, \u201cbut in the coming months we\u2019re going to be looking at a real severe food security situation\u201d.</p> <p>She was less optimistic than Lisa Laumann of Save the Children (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/30/sandy-superstorm-flooding-power-cuts#block-508fce92b5792d0b94e6eaa0%20\">see earlier</a>) that the government was well-prepared to deal with this disaster, coming as it does so soon after the 2010 earthquake and Isaac in 2011.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The government has been active from the very beginning. The national disaster management system has been mobilised early on, and this is a nationwide system. And the government has also been meeting with international organisations to coordinate the response, and has also allocated an additional $800,000 for initial response actions, so they have been very present and very active, but the reality is that they\u2019re stretched in terms of capacity and in terms of ability to respond \u2026</p> <p>The capacity for the government to respond even prior to these storms was starting to diminish. Funding is drying up for cholera response. So, big concern. There\u2019ll need to be a national joint effort with all key stakeholders to respond and to respond swiftly.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\" >  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;object data=&quot;http://abfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/swf/fullsize_player.swf&quot; id=&quot;boo_embed_1032437&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; height=&quot;129&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://abfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/swf/fullsize_player.swf&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;scale&quot; value=&quot;noscale&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;salign&quot; value=&quot;lt&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;bgColor&quot; value=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowScriptAccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;wmode&quot; value=&quot;window&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;FlashVars&quot; value=&quot;mp3=http%3A%2F%2Faudioboo.fm%2Fboos%2F1032437-hurricane-sandy-in-haiti-kristie-van-de-wetering-of-tearfund-talks-to-paul-owen-of-the-guardian.mp3%3Fkeyed%3Dtrue%26source%3Dembed&amp;amp;mp3Title=Hurricane+Sandy+in+Haiti%3A+Kristie+van+de+Wetering+of+Tearfund+talks+to+Paul+Owen+of+the+Guardian&amp;amp;mp3Time=01.35pm+30+Oct+2012&amp;amp;mp3LinkURL=http%3A%2F%2Faudioboo.fm%2Fboos%2F1032437-hurricane-sandy-in-haiti-kristie-van-de-wetering-of-tearfund-talks-to-paul-owen-of-the-guardian&amp;amp;mp3Author=PaulTOwen&amp;amp;rootID=boo_embed_1032437&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: none; display: block; width: 400px; height: 145px;&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;allowtransparency&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; marginheight=&quot;0&quot; marginwidth=&quot;0&quot; vspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://audioboo.fm/boos/1032437-hurricane-sandy-in-haiti-kristie-van-de-wetering-of-tearfund-talks-to-paul-owen-of-the-guardian/embed&quot; title=&quot;Audioboo player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-4be088ea-7c66-4ebc-90d8-310c0259fef9\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/30/1351605351867/5892f225-892b-46fa-822f-1e35d257ffdf-460.jpeg\" alt=\"A resident of Leogane, Haiti makes her way to her home as the water level continues to rise on 26 October 2012.

I think if the road infrastructure was stronger in this country, if there were better flood control, fewer people would die in emergencies like these.</p> </blockquote> <p>Laumann was speaking from a high-up area of Port-au-Prince, where there was no standing water, and children were out and off to school. \u201cThere certainly has been damage to some buildings, but it looks from here like a fairly normal day.\u201d</p> <p>But in the camps for those made homeless by the storm \u201cit\u2019s different\u201d:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>People lost their few assets that they had. They were flooded out \u2026 Life is much more challenging for them. It\u2019s hard when you lose most of your possessions or have them destroyed by a storm.</p> </blockquote> <p>In the south of the country there was a lot of road damage, she said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The last damage map that I took a look at showed damage in pretty much every department of the southern part of the country, much worse than the north. When you think about the fact that Haiti is already a road-challenged country, that\u2019s going to make problems for people who need to move around and for people who need to respond. Bridges have been broken, sections of road have been washed out, there\u2019s some land sliding over some of the roads.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-b049e51c-f6ba-45c2-bc8b-89eac47f229b\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/30/1351602063625/42cd89c9-da9f-4fd0-a7d3-6298969cdbe3-460.jpeg\" alt=\"The interior of a home is flooded after the passing of Hurricane Sandy in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on Saturday 27 October 2012.

Sandy has taken on the structure of a wintertime low-pressure area, so is no longer a tropical cyclone.</p> <p>The NHC says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The primary difference between a tropical cyclone and a wintertime cyclone is the energy source. Tropical cyclones extract heat from the ocean and grow by releasing that heat in the atmosphere near the storm center. Wintertime cyclones (also called extratropical or frontal <br>lows), on the other hand, get most of their energy from temperature contrasts in the atmosphere, and this energy usually gets distributed over larger areas.&#xa0;</p> <p>Because of these differences, tropical cyclones tend to have more compact wind fields, tend to be more symmetric, and have a well-defined inner core of strong winds. Wintertime lows have strong temperature contrasts or fronts attached to them, have a broader wind field, and more complex distributions of rain or snow.&#xa0;</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-508f94a795cb55519dae8b43\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-30T08:49:43.874Z\">8.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Fire in Queens, New York</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A fire department spokesman has told AP more than 190 firefighters are battling <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/30/sandy-superstorm-flooding-power-cuts?commentpage=all#block-508f8bc5b5792d0b94e6ea81\">the blaze in Breezy Point</a>.

The great blizzard of 1888 killed 400, including 200 in New York.</p> <p>Under the section Foreign Telegraphs we reported on Wednesday 14 March 1888</p> <blockquote> THE EXTRAORDINARY SNOWSTORM AT NEW YORK <br>THE RIVERS FROZEN OVER  New York, Monday  The storm which is raging here is the worst ever known in the city. People living in the suburbs have been unable to reach the city, and even those living in Brooklyn were either delayed for hours or prevented from reaching their places of business in New York, while according to some accounts persons residing in the city itself were five hours reaching their destination.  Little business was consequently done on the exchanges. The surface streets cars have been abandoned, and the trams on the elevated railway run into their sheds.  There are no trains leaving New York for the provinces. During the wildest part of the storm a train ran into the rear of another on the Third Avenue elevated line.  The excitement thus caused was terrific. The engineer was killed and a number of persons hurt. The gale continued unabated throughout the afternoon, the wind shifting to the west. Navigation is entirely suspended and the business of the post-office paralysed.  The storm, which extends about sixty miles inland began about midnight with a falling thermometer, though previously there had been heavy rain. Many cab proprietors refused to let their horses and vehicles leave the stables.  The East River bridge was temporarily closed. Enormous drifts were formed in the streets by the snow and at times pedestrians became bewildered and lost their way. Telegraphic communication with the south-west and east was completely severed during the afternoon. <strong>New York, Tuesday Noon.</strong> <br> Notwithstanding the abatement in the snowfall, trains on the surface railways are still unable to run, owing to the immense accumulations of snow. Traffic on the elevated railways is carried on irregularly.  The railways leading into the city are blocked, and the ferryboats are stuckfast in the ice. North and East Rivers are blocked by ice between New York and Brooklyn. People are now crossing the ice on foot from one place to the other.

Available for </strong><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wunderlist/id406644151?mt=8\" title=\"\"><strong>iTunes</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wunderkinder.wunderlistandroid&amp;hl=en\" title=\"\"><strong>Android</strong></a></p> <p><strong>Clear, \u00a31.49. Available for </strong><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/clear/id493136154?mt=8\" title=\"\"><strong>iTunes</strong></a></p> <p>Both are simple list makers, but Wunderlist doubles as a task manager. Clear, with its ice-cold swipe and swoosh functions, feels like an app the iPhone was made for. Don't expect it to do more than make lists though \u2013 it doesn't.</p> <p>Wunderlist, however, lets you give individual list items due dates and reminders, and it will sync with your desktop. A good way to use it is to give each module you're studying its own list and then add tasks or reminders to it.</p> <h2>Evernote vs. Simplenote</h2> <p><strong>Evernote, free. Available on </strong><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/evernote/id281796108?mt=8\" title=\"\"><strong>iTunes</strong></a><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Simplenote, free. Available on </strong><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/simplenote/id289429962?mt=8\" title=\"\"><strong>iTunes</strong></a></p> <p>You'll do a lot of note-taking at university so it's worth getting your hands on either of these. Evernote is one of the most popular and powerful note makers. Entries can be made as text, audio or photos, filed in a particular notebook, and synced with other devices.</p> <p>Simplenote is, as its name suggests, a simple note maker. You can write notes, file them and share them. That's it. If you're looking for a digital jotter, pick this. If you want a solid, capable and modern project book, pick Evernote.</p> <h2>Pin Drop vs. Foursquare </h2> <p><strong>Foursquare, free. Available for </strong><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/foursquare/id306934924?mt=8\" title=\"\"><strong>iTunes</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joelapenna.foursquared&amp;hl=en\" title=\"\"><strong>Android</strong></a><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Pin Drop, free.

Pin new haunts to your map, add photos and tags, and share them on Twitter.</p> <p>Foursquare is Pin Drop's more sociable \u2013 and more fun \u2013 older brother. Checking in to places earns you points and badges, which are surprisingly rewarding. It also pits you against your mates by tracking where they're at. Making your whereabouts public can be annoying though \u2013 you might find that people bump into you.</p> <h2>MoneyBook vs Pocket Expense <br></h2> <p><strong>MoneyBook, \u00a31.99. Available on </strong><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/moneybook/id337954399?mt=8\" title=\"\"><strong>iTunes</strong></a></p> <p><strong>Pocket Expense, \u00a32.99. Available on </strong><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/pocket-expense/id417328997?mt=8\" title=\"\"><strong>iTunes</strong></a></p> <p>If you find money stressful, MoneyBook can help. Its simple design and powerful functionality make keeping track of what you've spent easy.</p> <p>Other money apps, like Pocket Expense, are a bit nerdy and have too many functions. They're probably more suited to your parents.</p> <p>With MoneyBook you can categorise your spending and get monthly breakdowns. There's only problem: remembering how much those shots of tequila cost may be as hard as remembering how many you had.</p> <h2>Pocket vs. Zootool </h2> <p><strong>Pocket, free. Available on </strong><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/pocket-formerly-read-it-later/id309601447?mt=8\" title=\"\"><strong>iTunes</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href=\"http://getpocket.com/android/\" title=\"\"><strong>Android</strong></a><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Zootool, \u00a31.49. Available on </strong><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/zootool/id435285567?mt=8\" title=\"\"><strong>iTunes</strong></a></p> <p>Pocket, a super-savvy saving tool, used to be called Read It Later. In its new form, it's is both neater and cooler. Zootool is very similar but with more sociable functions. You can create a profile, view what others have put into captivity, share your finds and follow fellow keepers.</p> <p>Both are great if you're researching or if you want to keep what you've found in one easily accessible space. Likewise, both are available in-browser too and allow you to save your finds with just one click.</p> <p>The differences: Zootool is best suited to images and Pocket does a great job of stripping a page down to only text, making reading easier.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Have you discovered an app that makes student life simpler?

Dadikhi is harming the revolution. The FSA command has issued many statements declaring that this man is a gang leader and he does not represent the FSA.</p> <p>We as rebels vehemently oppose the of kidnapping of the Lebanese journalist. Dadikhi claims he commands a rebel brigade, but he does not. He is just a gang leader, using this as a cover story.</p> <p>People in Azaz have protested against Dadikhi many times because of the problems he has caused in the town.</p> <p>Some of the commanders in the FSA say 'now is not the time to be taking on people like Dadikhi'. But I think this is wrong because he will harm the reputation of the revolution untill he is stopped.</p> <p>Itani was in Aleppo with the FSA. He filmed big operations by the FSA during the last battles. He was heading back to Lebanon through Azaz, when was taken by Dadikhi's guys. Most of the journalists who want to leave Aleppo take the route from Azaz, and the nearby Salama border checkpoint.</p> <p>But the checkpoint is under the control of Dadikhi and his gang. Dadikhi said he had stopped Itani to ask him few questions and will release him soon.
