  "<p>It is two years this month since my mother died, which may seem a gloomy way to start a column called the Happy Eater but it really isn't. Of course there is loss. But with time, memory brings a certain sweetness, too; if you live a life at the table and had my mother, well then, there are more than enough cues for good memories. She was the one who taught me how to eat. Not so much in the functional sense, although there was that; we have to learn our table skills somewhere. It lay more in enthusiasm. Both my parents had endured childhoods of little rather than plenty and they were determined to banish all of that from their own kids' lives. A full table was not merely a mark of appetite. It was a victory.</p> <p>There was, when we were growing up, a simple rule in our house, one that now operates in mine: you cannot say you don't like something unless you have tried it. This came in handy when the naughtiness of adolescence came my way \u2013 I was only trying to find out whether I liked it \u2013 but as a kid it opened the doorway to all manner of fun. It was my mum who showed me how to eat my first oyster, grinning from ear to ear as the accessories piled up around us: the frame for the tray of ice, the tiny flat two-pronged fork, the muslin-wrapped lemon, the shallot vinegar and Tabasco. Dress it as you will, she said. Check it's been released from its sticking place on the shell with the fork then, whoosh, down the hatch in one. Chew if you like, but not too much. Try it with a sip of this Sancerre. Sniff it. Smells a bit like cat's wee doesn't it. But doesn't it work well with the oyster. Yes, mother, it does.</p> <p>She adored the theatre and any food which came with a bit of that was OK with her; even better, if it required strict instructions. She loved steak tartare, but needed to be asked how piquant she wanted it, and would brighten further if the final mixing of the egg yolk into the chopped beef happened tableside. Although she wasn't especially fond of snails in their butter-slicked shells, she understood why I loved them, and took pleasure in showing me how to hold the tongs, wrist loose, grip just so. A few years ago I lost a bet with her; the winnings were lunch at the Fat Duck on me. I wasn't sure she would like it. For years she had been a regular amid the red velvet plush and certainties of Rules, the oldest restaurant in London with its brass trim and menu of game; when the Wolseley opened and proved itself reliable at the Mitteleuropean schtick she quickly embraced it. They did a good steak tartare there. As did the Ivy, though Sheekey's was the place for oysters.</p> <p>So what would she make of Heston Blumenthal's exuberant modernist fancies? I had no idea. But if the Fat Duck is anything it is pure theatre: the moment the waiter bathed the foamed green tea palate cleanser in liquid nitrogen, the vapours rolling out across the table, she was sold. Not that she was overly impressed by the gloss and shine of that world. True luxury didn't need spin, she said. One night a few years ago my wife and I met my parents for dinner. On the menu my mother spotted \"lobster and chips\". She nodded slowly, in recognition. \"Now that,\" she said, \"is class.\" We both ordered it and sat, side by side, bibs in place, the emptied shells piling up around us as we worked. We were happy. My mother was right.</p>",
  "<p>The winners of this year's newcomer award are more like a rock band than a restaurant. The name refers not to a bricks-and-mortar establishment but to a collective of chefs who are, aptly enough, young, ambitious and healthily iconoclastic. They make fleeting appearances at unconventional venues, keeping fans in the loop on Twitter. If you caught them last summer at a disused office building in Canary Wharf, or on the roof of a car park in Peckham where they reimagined dishes for a Turkish ocakbasi grill, count yourself lucky: these events have acquired semi-legendary status in the London food world.</p> <p>Last October, we had a chance to get to know <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jan/22/young-turks-pop-up-restaurants\" title=\"\">James Lowe and Isaac McHale </a>a little better when they settled down for a six-month residency above the Ten Bells pub in Spitalfields. Here, they had a chance to cook food that was inventive and daring without being flashy in a room that had none of the hush and formality you associate with fine dining (you had to cross the crowded floor of the pub and climb a narrow, creaky staircase to get to it). Since then, they've been touring their talents around the world, to Mexico City, Shanghai and New York, where last month they did a successful turn at the prestigious Le Fooding event.</p> <p>For all their unconventional working habits and punkish attitude, however, the Young Turks are not quite as radical as they sound. They became chefs the usual way, paying dues in high-pressure kitchens, albeit rapidly. Thirty-three-year-old Lowe cooked at La Trompette and the Fat Duck before becoming, at 26, head chef at St John Bread &amp; Wine. McHale, 32, worked at the Ledbury in west London for five years and did a stint at Noma in Copenhagen. A third member, Ben Greeno, also worked at Noma, but dropped out of the Turks to work for David Chang at Momofuku Seiobo in Sydney.</p> <p>The Young Turks formed when Lowe, McHale and Greeno were invited separately to guest-chef at the influential Loft Project supper club in east London. \"We shared views on the London food scene and food in general,\" Lowe tells me. \"Each of us was keeping a close eye on what was happening abroad \u2013 in the States and Japan and around Europe \u2013 whereas many British chefs were still very inward-looking.\"</p> <p>\"We had various ideals,\" says McHale. \"Eating more vegetables, paring things back a bit, sharing ideas instead of being secretive.\" Reclaiming neglected British ingredients and updating antique recipes were other areas of common ground. One of Lowe's most successful dishes, when the Young Turks returned to the Loft in spring 2011, was a very traditional British pairing of beef and oysters, but served raw with chickweed.</p> <p>Although founded on honest food philosophies and serious talent, the Young Turks had astute marketing: the swaggering identity and the shrewd use of social media guaranteed column inches as well as bookings. Both are now working on solo projects. McHale is preparing to open a permanent restaurant at Shoreditch Town Hall in January \u2013 he's calling it the Clove Club.</p> <p>Again, social media has proved invaluable to his progress: using the crowdfunding website Crowdcube, McHale raised \u00a3250,000 from 50 donors to help get the project started. Meanwhile, he has kept the Ten Bells restaurant going. It's no longer officially a Young Turks operation \u2013 young ex-Ledbury chef Giorgio Ravelli is in charge of the kitchen \u2013 but some of McHale's dishes, including his justly famous buttermilk chicken and pine salt, are still on the menu.</p> <p>James Lowe took the summer off to do a chef's Grand Tour \u2013 \"China for a month, Taiwan, Italy for a few weeks, Copenhagen, Mexico, Brazil and Colombia\" \u2013 and and now he too is looking to start up a restaurant of his own in east London. Does this signal the end of the Young Turks?</p> <p>No, McHale says, though he admits the relationship may change. \"It was never a till-death-do-us-part arrangement, it was a springboard to us finding our own sites. It went better than we expected \u2013 but we have to be true to our own identities and do our own things.\" Young Turks projects will continue to happen \u2013 they will be cooking in Turin at the end of October \u2013 albeit less frequently, and McHale and Lowe remain enthusiastic about their alliance.</p> <p>According to McHale, last month's Le Fooding extravaganza in New York was \"the most fun foreign event we've done. We were nervous when we started doing them but now it's less nerves, more enjoyment \u2013 and it helped that everyone seemed to have heard of us. We're proud of the things we've done together as Young Turks,\" he adds. \"Hopefully, this is only really the beginning.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://youngturks.co/\" title=\"\"><em>youngturks.co.uk</em></a><em>; </em><a href=\"http://thecloveclub.com/\" title=\"\"><em>thecloveclub.com</em></a><em>; </em><a href=\"http://tenbells.com\" title=\"\"><em>tenbells.com</em></a></p>",

With minimal fuss and the kind of travel budget that wouldn't get Brian Cox past the credit sequence, Professor Al-Khalili turned the establishment of the laws of thermodynamics into a captivating scientific tale.</p> <p>The first law, as you may recall, holds that energy is not created or destroyed \u2013 it just changes form. And the second and infinitely more pessimistic law maintains that energy tends to disperse, from physical unity towards fragmented chaos. Which is to say that the universe is slowly coming apart and one day all that is left will be an endless nothing.</p> <p>Before there was time to run a hot bath in which to slit your wrists, Al-Khalili enthusiastically reminded us that although the underlying cosmic trend is towards increasing entropy, or irreversible decay, we on earth are currently enjoying a \"brief, beautiful creative moment\".</p> <p>That may be a consoling thought but, one must ask, has the professor never seen <strong>Me and Mrs Jones</strong>? If this crummy yummy mummy sitcom doesn't in itself herald the end of the universe, it does make you question what 14bn years of cosmic existence has achieved.</p> <p>After the desperate opener, the humane hope was that, contrary to the second law of thermodynamics, things could only get better. But the second episode proved that hope to be vainer than Simon Cowell.</p> <p>Character may not always be destiny in real life, but it is in real comedy. And like far too many British comedies, <em>Me and Mrs Jones</em>, a school gate farce, has no characters. Instead it has \"types\": the hapless single mother, the neighbourhood busybody, the humourless Nordic sex bomb.</p> <p>To watch Sarah Alexander as Mrs Jones work herself into a mirthless fluster is to long to see Wendy Craig in a rerun of Carla Lane's 70s sitcom <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/butterflies/\" title=\"\"><em>Butterflies</em></a>, a&#xa0;yearning I have never previously felt in danger of experiencing. Yet say&#xa0;what&#xa0;you will about Craig's Ria, she&#xa0;was drawn from an active imagination rather than an exhausted comic trope.</p> <p>The stock ciphers in <em>Me and Mrs Jones</em> possess no animating truth and therefore inspire no sympathy \u2013 the paradox of comedy being that you have to feel for people before you can laugh at them. Whatever pity was mustered went on the actors, whose lines were so limp that it seemed like a cruel and unusual punishment to leave them dangling without the protection of a laughter track.</p> <p>In historical terms, the demise of the laughter track must be hailed as a positive development in British sitcom. For is there not something creepily controlling about being prompted to laugh? Apart from anything else, it denies us the basic human right of&#xa0;spontaneity.</p> <p>But with the sort of sitcoms that British television churns out with mystifying regularity, the laughter track performs a vital practical role. It provides the only sign that these shows are comedies. Take that away and you're left with an extreme version of Brechtian alienation, only without the intellectual kudos.</p> <p>When, for example, Inca the Nordic sex bomb said: \"I am Swedish\", you could detect immediately afterwards a ghostly appeal to a notional sense of humour \u2013 the empty beat where the laughter was supposed to go. Call it the&#xa0;silence of comic entropy, this was the haunted sound of a joke that had not just died but decomposed into absolute nothingness.</p> <p>The same sound was heard again in <strong>Hebburn</strong>, a new situation comedy that is really a location comedy. Although presented in an affectionate guise, the basic idea is that they're a bit dim in the&#xa0;north east. It starred Chris Ramsey&#xa0;and a highly cuffable haircut as Jack, a journalist returning to his hometown with his new wife, Sarah (Kimberley Nixon).</p> <p>Hebburn, Jack told Sarah, is \"where dreams come to die\". That's not a bad proposition, comedy-wise, but unfortunately, <em>Hebburn</em> turned out on closer inspection to be the place where jokes go to die.</p> <p>The one about Sarah's Jewishness sending the locals into a state of anxious cultural confusion took a particularly long and painful time to expire. It started with Jack's mum (Gina McKee) cutting holes in sandwich baps to serve them as bagels,&#xa0;and went on from there without going anywhere.</p> <p>As Jack's father, Jim Moir (aka Vic Reeves) was a curiously detached presence, as though he had decided to keep very quiet in the conviction that no one would notice it was him. No doubt this was admirable self-restraint, but how much more entertaining things would have been if he had turned to his screen wife McKee during the bagel saga and in his biggest <em>Big Night Out</em> accent shouted: \"You wouldn't let it lie!\"</p> <p>Thank cosmic order for <strong>Fresh Meat</strong>, almost an hour of laugh-out-loud comic astuteness that single-handedly restored faith in the British ability to be funny. Written by <em>Peep Show</em> combo, Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain, who are truly enjoying a beautiful creative moment, it's a student comedy neatly pitched between <em>Peep Show</em> and <em>The Inbetweeners</em>, and is arguably better than both.</p> <p>Now in its second series, the show works on a multitude of levels. Each character is fully realised and integral to the set-up, the plots are loose but satisfyingly coherent, and the caustically absurd yet uncannily authentic dialogue succeeds in defining&#xa0;its own inspirationally demented&#xa0;world.</p> <p>In Howard (Greg McHugh), the paranoid Scot, and JP (Jack Whitehall), the smug public schoolboy,&#xa0;the show boasts two of the finest comic creations&#xa0;to come along in years. Whereas the contrast&#xa0;between Sabine, the plain-speaking Dutchwoman (Jelka van Houten), and <em>Me and Mrs Jones</em>'s Inca says everything that needs to be known about the difference between fresh and&#xa0;stale.</p> <p>In last week's second episode, JP had mumps and, advised that he risked infertility, he rashly chose to store his sperm in the student house's shared freezer ice cube tray. Meanwhile the newly arrived Sabine was still getting to grips with the haphazard communal workings of the kitchen.</p> <p>You might have thought you'd know how or, more precisely, where this particular climax was going to finish. The mark of the best comedy, however, is that it subverts the obvious&#xa0;even while playing it for all it's&#xa0;worth. In the end the payoff was hard to swallow, but only because it&#xa0;left me spluttering so violently with&#xa0;laughter.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Braithwaite, near Keswick, Cumbria (01768 778 409) Meal for two, including wine and service \u00a395</strong></p> <p>If a great meal begins with a journey, then the drive to the Cottage in the Wood, on a hill high above Keswick in the Lake District, is the ultimate appetiser. Viewed purely from above via a satnav, you appear not to move, so tight are the turns on the Whinlatter Pass. And then all of a sudden you turn a bend and there it is: a solidly built whitewashed house perched on a hillside with views out across one of England's greatest landscapes. There is, for the record, another small hotel of the same name near Malvern which likewise claims astonishing views. But there is something about the defiantly unmanicured roughness of Cumbria which for me gives it the edge. It almost makes me want to go hill walking, which is odd given that I&#xa0;regard my natural habitat as the back seat of a black cab.</p> <p>A nice drive and a&#xa0;good view are lovely. The challenge is to communicate the intense sense of place through the food on the plate. For Cumbria is one of this country's great&#xa0;larders. From the coast there are the sweet shrimps of Morecambe Bay and from the valleys the neglected joys of damsons. And then there is the Herdwick \u2013 the bruiser of the sheep world, built for a life on the high fells. It is at its best when allowed to roam a little longer than most sheep in this country get \u2013 a&#xa0;life lived well and one of those labels worth getting excited about.</p> <p>Young chef Ryan Blackburn, who previously worked with Martin Wishart in Edinburgh, knows how to cook it properly. His menu bigs up where his produce originated in a way that makes it read like one of Alfred Wainwright's walking guides. There are girolles from Loweswater and turbot from Whitehaven, partridge from Alston Moor, that Herdwick from Yew Tree Farm, and Curthwaite curd ice cream. Sometimes this kind of label fetishism can read like shameless grandstanding. But when the cooking is so assured it makes sense. The dinner menu is short, just eight savoury dishes, but some can be had in both starter and main-course sizes. Three are \u00a336, rising to \u00a354 for five.</p> <p>Mackerel arrives, much like me by this point, lightly soused in the way this oily fish understands. Alongside is the sweetness of roasted beetroot, the understated bitterness of watercress and the kick of horseradish cream. A&#xa0;perfect tranche of turbot is partnered with a crisp disc of long-cooked pig's trotter and, to bring it all to life, a whizzy vinaigrette of cockles. Best of all is the big-flavoured Herdwick hogget served both roast and as a cylinder of something rich and braised, alongside a couple of pink fir potatoes and some baby leeks and glazed salsify. The plating may be delicate, but the cooking is big and bold. It speaks of a cook who understands that he has arrived somewhere special and is determined to make a virtue of it.</p> <p>If there is a weakness, it is at dessert. The execution of what is described is fine; the dishes are just not quite greedy enough. So a perfectly poached peach arrives with a set cream flavoured with rosemary, and the herb is just a little overwhelming. Ditto a&#xa0;beautiful bowl of raspberries, the colour of&#xa0;velvet plush, with a lavender cream. This, I admit, is a&#xa0;prejudice of mine. I always think lavender makes things taste like you imagine an old lady's knicker drawer would smell. Much better was a soft parsnip and walnut cake with honey-roasted figs. It had a certain lusciousness, present in the savoury courses, which the sweet course needs a little more of.</p> <p>This is, though, a small point. The owners, Liam and Kath Berney, used to be teachers, and they bring a&#xa0;brisk, friendly efficiency to service. There is a keenly priced wine list plus handsome, sturdy dining rooms in which to enjoy it. Best of all, there is the sense that the drive up the hill was more than worth it.</p> <p>Email Jay at <a href=\"mailto:jay.rayner@observer.co.uk\" title=\"\">jay.rayner@observer.co.uk</a> or visit<br> <a href=\"http://theguardian.com/profile/jayrayner\" title=\"\">theguardian.com/profile/jayrayner</a> for all his reviews in one place</p>",
  "<p>During my years as a temporary New Yorker, it was my honour to befriend \u2013 and meet regularly for lunch \u2013 a Welshman who is among those rare people to qualify for that devalued and over-used term \"genius\": John Cale, known most commonly as the bass and viola player for the Velvet Underground, which is a shame, for he is the composer of so much more and better music since.</p> <p>We met usually on Fridays, when his touring schedule and my deadlines permitted, at an excellent trattoria called Bar Pitti on the corner of 6th Avenue and Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village. Our conversations were a delight, as exhausting as they were relaxing because the subject matter hurtled between politics (Blair and Bush were at war), music, the random pointlessness of existence, weird nooks and crannies of history, literature and our daughters.</p> <p>Some of Cale's favourite subjects \u2013 digital technology and espionage \u2013 left me bewildered. And I never knew he was interested in the obscurities of haute cuisine; there was no need to acknowledge such an issue in Bar Pitti, which was proof that nothing beats simple food \u2013<em> cucina casalinga</em> (literally \"housewives' cooking\") \u2013 done well. He would nibble at salted spinach while I enjoyed farfalle ai funghi porcini. After decades of rock'n'roll excess, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwzaifhSw2c\" title=\"\">Venus in Furs</a>, illness and injectable adventures, he was, and remains, a remarkably fit, teetotal 70-year-old. Crucially, however, he would attack the panna cotta smothered in chocolate sauce with as much relish as I did.</p> <p>When he uprooted, 3,000 miles west to LA, and I moved the same distance in the opposite direction to London, we determined to remain in touch. We usually meet at Daunt Books on Holland Park Avenue, exchange gifts to read, then walk and talk in the park. And when we ate, it was invariably at Wagamama, to accommodate his need for soya and carrot juice. I drank Asian beer and found it hard to taste the food \u2013 so we found a compromise to suit us both: fantastic Lebanese mezze at a place called Al-Waha on Westbourne Grove. There was one especially memorable lunch there, for which Cale arrived with his manager Nita and daughter Eden, having just received his OBE from Prince Charles \u2013 he still wore the suit, and hair he had dyed pink for the occasion.</p> <p>But now, for this article, Cale wants to try something more elaborate. Over in London to promote <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/27/john-cale-popandrock\" title=\"his new album Shifty Adventures in Nookie Wood\">his new album <em>Shifty Adventures in Nookie Wood</em></a>, he opts for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/feb/27/jay-rayner-dinner-heston-blumenthal\" title=\"\">Dinner</a>, Heston Blumenthal's restaurant at the Mandarin Oriental hotel in Knightsbridge.</p> <p>For me, this is like boarding a space craft to some very weird planet. We sit by the window overlooking Hyde Park, and as ever we seem to continue the conversation we were having last time. \"They've created an economy in&#xa0;America where people get rich in a certain way,\" he reflects. \"It's a&#xa0;new kind of money with a new kind of power.\"</p> <p>I get the impression, looking at our fellow diners and the businessmen drinking champagne in little corners with ladies to whom they may not be married, that we are the only people in here having this conversation.</p> <p>The menu is made up of Olde Englishe dishes, with dates of their original debuts. Cale starts with nettle porridge (dating from 1660) made of \"roast cod palate\" which, the waiter explains, is a \"cod's tongue cooked very slowly from the inside\". Cale loves it. \"This is delicious,\" he affirms, while I get to learn how big cods' tongues are \u2013 it includes their throats, and this one, the waiter says, has been cooked for 72 hours at 56 degrees.</p> <p>As a vegetarian, I pose a difficulty, and start with a cold broth of lamb, without the lamb, and Cale is riveted by the fact that an egg floating about in it had been poached for several hours. He tells me about all this: it's called cryogenic or sous-vide cooking. He describes one machine which enables the chefs to \"control the temperature of the water \u2013 a big thing with dials on it\" while nitrogen is used to freeze.</p> <p>I try to work out why Cale never talked about any of this before, and why he is so passionate about it now: this is test-tube cooking, the opposite of <em>cucina casalinga</em> in Bar Pitti. It may be because he loves gadgets that work well, and more important, because he approves of people who know what they are doing and do it well. Cale loves competence, and expertise.</p> <p><strong>While waiting for our main courses, </strong>we also discuss the new album, which is compelling and typically innovative. Cale likes silly jokes \u2013 he sends them constantly by email \u2013 and understands how they reflect the absurdity of life,&#xa0;which is why this record has a silly title.</p> <p>He also remains strongly attached to his roots and childhood in South Wales. On such occasions as the premiere of an epic orchestration of his 1973 album<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/jun/23/popandrock.shopping1\" title=\" Paris 1919\"> <em>Paris 1919</em></a> in Cardiff, or launching a UK tour in Wrexham, the crowds have loved his Welsh greetings \u2013 a man once leaned over me in the front row during a gig at the Cardiff Coal Exchange and affirmed at high, drunken volume: \"He's ours.\"</p> <p>And Cale loves experimentation with sound \u2013 this is his quintessence, and in this he can never stay still.</p> <p>So on this new album we have a convergence of all these themes: surreal humour, connection to childhood and a soundscape that winds through thickets of lyricism to what Cale rightly calls, \"the soundtrack to a claustrophobic film\". Some of it is, he says, \"about the trauma of childhood\", the music full of mood swings but with \"moments of shelter\", as he puts it.</p> <p>Perhaps that is why he likes this experimentation with food \u2013 it is technological.</p> <p>His roast turbot now arrives. First cooked circa 1830, it is served with \"cockle ketchup\" and Cale gives the waiter quite a hard time over his account of how the dish was discovered by \"some of the British emperors who went to Malaysia and saw the recipe\" \u2013 which emperor? When and how did he or they go?</p> <p>I have rice and flesh, with saffron but without the calf tail specified on the menu, which makes it a risotto alla milanese \u2013 which is almost as good as some of the un-cryogenically cooked versions I've eaten in Milan, and better than many.</p> <p>At the end, something special happens. In the best tradition of his diet-busting panna cotta in New York, Cale insists on a dessert \u2013 something he had never done at Wagamama. And thank God he did, for along came a portion of brown bread ice cream and the recommended tipsy cake, pineapple-flavoured, roasted on a spit with apple juice and caramel, and doused in Marsala wine. \"Non-ghee,\" Cale adds, \"clarified butter\" \u2013 then he gave up: \"It's basically just a heavy dose of sugar.\"</p> <p>It was also succulent, sweet and so good that Cale asked for another portion to go. He's spent too long in America \u2013 it was against the rules.</p> <p>I suddenly remembered an uncle of my mother's in North Wales, who was Calvinist and avidly teetotal, but who always loved a second helping of potent sherry trifle with sabbath-day lunch after chapel. Maybe that was what Cale liked so much about tipsy cake, as he suddenly decides it is time to leave, springs out of his seat and walks out past the sheepishly secretive champagne-sipping couples.</p> <p>Outside, by One Hyde Park, with its Ferrari showroom on the ground floor, we meet Cale's manager and the album promotion team. Had we had a good lunch? \"Delicious, very good,\" says the satisfied musician, \"did you?\"</p> <p>\"Yes, thanks,\" replies the girl from the record label, \"we went to the Lebanese.\"</p> <p><em>Shifty Adventures in Nookie Wood is out now on Double Six/Domino Records</em></p>",
  "<p>Part guide for the aspiring home cook, part culinary memoir, Laurie Colwin's republished collection of essays, <em>Home Cooking</em>, is a feast. Blending anecdotes, reflections and recipes from 40 or so years in the kitchen, Colwin's witty, no-nonsense prose oozes delight in earthy, home-crafted cuisine: \"I love to eat out, but even more, I love to eat in.\"</p> <p>A New York-based writer who died unexpectedly aged 48 in 1992, Colwin published several novels before moving into food writing, which, in 1988, had only a fraction of the cachet it has today. In her wry and unaffected style, Colwin presents the kitchen as a nucleus where childhood and motherhood, falling in and out of love, boredom and learning and success and failure are all played out.</p> <p>Colwin stresses that although some have an \"inborn talent\" for cookery, these are skills that can be acquired with some commitment to good food. <em>Home Cooking</em> is her account of building up a wholesome (if not healthy) repertoire for home entertaining \u2013 from fried chicken \"that makes people want to stand up and sing the Star-Spangled Banner\" (it does, I tried) to easy beef stews, sauteed vegetables with poached egg in one pot, home-baked bread (\"without the agony\") and the simplest of puddings, orange ambrosia. Indeed, there are echoes of Nigella Lawson, one of Colwin's fans, the UK's own elegant earth mother championing straightforward food in both her writing and cooking.</p> <p>Colwin's take on food is at once universal and deeply personal: \"Most people are idiosyncratic about food.\" She pokes light fun at the food foibles of others (if your friends are allergic to wheat/dairy/fish, then \"change friends instantly and find some red-blooded chowhounds with few scruples and no interest in health\"), while remaining fully aware of her own gastro quirks (eggplant with tamari, garlic and coffee was a favourite). \"Certainly cooking for oneself reveals man at his weirdest,\" she writes.</p> <p><em>Home Cooking</em> is both timeless and dated, all-American and inclusive. Colwin's references to organic chicken being \"not easy to find\" and fondue sets being given as wedding gifts ground her work in another era. All-American places and brand names are also ubiquitous \u2013 Walnut Acres of Penns Creek, Pennsylvania; Bleecker Street; 3 Musketeers chocolate and Rocky Road ice-cream.Yet the principles she proposes are eternal, from the essential kitchen kit she recommends in a chapter titled \"The Low Tech Person's Batterie de Cuisine\" to her belief in trial and error. She is wholly accepting of the US food landscape around her, but is open to foreign alternatives, as her (very kind) essay \"English Food\" testifies: \"When it comes to cakes and puddings, savouries, bread and tea cakes, the English cannot be surpassed.\"</p> <p>Witty and weighty, <em>Home Cooking</em> is a culinary companion as comfortable beside your bed as your cooker. It has an essay for everyone who loves to eat and demonstrates that home is where the heart is \u2013 and the stomach happiest.</p>",
  "<p>Are there not some days when you look at England and see a country with which we have less in common than Burkino Faso? Maybe there have always been such days. There certainly must have been when Margaret Thatcher was in power and she was bribing the police to act like thugs in her war against the miners or when she imposed the poll tax on Scots. But such occasions still seemed too few to be able to supplant the memories of a brave and steadfast nation whose sons had died with ours in the war against fascism.</p> <p>We are talking here about a people who have never bridled even as they routinely let Scots trample all over their Nigels and Cecils to run the army, the civil service, the media, the banks and the government.</p> <p>And why did our families return year after year to Blackpool, Morecambe and Scarborough to renew acquaintances with Alf and Doreen, the proprietors of their favourite guesthouses, if it wasn't because they always regarded England as their home from home? I fear, though, that this age has passed and each year brings us increasingly more days when England looks like \u2013 and feels like \u2013 a foreign state.</p> <p>In the last two years, we have witnessed Westminster's coalition government of English millionaire landowners decide that the poor must bear the brunt of their austerity programme and that the lives of the sick, the vulnerable and the elderly must become a little bit harsher. They continue to rail against benefit cheats and feckless families and irresponsible parents who refuse to discipline their children. They wish to penalise poor people if they insist on having more children. Soon, a standing army of state-funded child-catchers will emerge armed with licences to take urchins from their homes if it can be proved they were begotten in penury.</p> <p>Yet even as they wage their war against the poor they continue to indulge the billionaire money-changers who, alone, bankrupted the country, fuelled by nothing more than avarice. These people are still awarding themselves obscene bonuses and destroying small and honest business by denying them credit facilities. The Westminster government, however, wants to bribe factory workers with worthless company share options in return for agreeing to go peacefully when they are sacked. And then they want to make it easier for bosses to sack workers without fear of falling foul of pesky employment laws. Here's a jolly wheeze: perhaps once the state rat-catchers have rounded up all the disease-ridden wretches of the feckless poor they could be made to labour in workhouses breaking stones and picking oakum.</p> <p>When that idiot Boris Johnson addressed thousands of fawning Tories at their annual conference, they were incontinent with desire as he told them that they had to create the correct economic conditions that would allow the nation's wealth-creators to thrive. What he meant, of course, was that we should stand by again and refuse to intervene if the country's greediest and most ruthless bankers want to bend us over the kitchen table once more. When even Max Hastings, the world's most English person, feels moved to warn his countrymen about the perils of being seduced by mad Boris, you know that something is rotten in the heart of Albion.</p> <p>Less than two years ago, we watched Met officers use the same intimidation that had worked on the miners to abuse marching students and public-sector workers. A few months later, judges sitting in London were abandoning all sense of proportion and natural justice as they handed down heavy sentences to youths caught stealing television sets during the London riots. Recently, the education secretary, Michael Gove, previously thought to be one of the government's more sensible and hysteria-free ministers, looked like he had also been afflicted with Mad Boris Disease as he attacked Johnny Foreigner in an anti-European frenzy.</p> <p>A few days prior to this, in a joint newspaper article, the chancellor, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2214384/George-Osborne-Iain-Duncan-Smith-set-end-culture.html\" title=\"\">George Osborne, and the work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith</a>, discussed how they aim to reduce the welfare bill by \u00a318bn. Aye, right. This fearless and crusading duo had obviously taken inspiration and nourishment from Johann Lamont, our very ain Scottish Labour leader, as their article was headed: \"How we'll end the something-for-nothing-culture\". There's an easier way for George and Iain to claw back \u00a318bn. In so doing, they would be ending a real something-for-nothing-culture \u2013 the one that allows many of the richest people and the biggest companies operating in the United Kingdom to cheat the revenue out of billions in aggressive tax-avoidance schemes.</p> <p>What has Labour been doing while all of this has been happening? Why, they've spent the last two weeks calling for the resignation of the Tory chief whip because he said something unpleasant to a couple of Downing Street coppers. Someone ought to tell Ed Miliband that saying unpleasant things to the bill on a regular basis is a sign of a healthy and mature democracy.</p> <p>At the SNP annual conference in Perth, party delegates and supporters seem a little bit more subdued than they were at Inverness last year. They have not recently been accustomed to squabbling among themselves as they have been over Nato membership. And perhaps the most recent opinion polls purporting to show support for independence falling have led to a little more introspection. Yet they needn't worry too much. David Cameron and George Osborne are hellbent on making Britain as unjust, unequal and xenophobic as it was when Charles Dickens was writing about the iniquities of workhouses and Poor Laws. In so doing, they are helping to write the SNP's white paper on independence. In this, Alex Salmond simply has to say that an independent Scotland will provide for its poor and its weak; protect its workers; welcome asylum seekers, refugees and immigrants; refuse to kill its young men in unjust wars; and banish the greed of financiers and the opportunism of the energy cartels.</p> <p>He simply has to say that an independent Scotland will be everything that sick England, right now, is not.</p> <p><em>Comments will be swtiched on later</em></p>",
  "<p>Last week, in this space, I broke the law. Technically, I could be prosecuted. Technically, my only hope is that Rowan Atkinson can get the law changed before a gloved hand knocks at my door.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/14/victoria-coren-lucy-liu-sherlock-holmes\" title=\"\">My column about <em>Elementary</em></a> was one of the most-read articles on the Comment Is Free website for days. What an accolade, the casual observer might think. After all, we live in a serious world. Some girl's unenthusiasm for a TV series in which Sherlock Holmes is a New York junkie and Doctor Watson is a sexy lady from <em>Charlie's Angels</em> is not a serious matter. If thousands of web-surfers are poring over that column, what a tremendously entertaining piece it must be.</p> <p>But no. It was not my creative writing that fascinated people, but my racism. And as a little sweetener, like sprinkles on an ice cream, my sexism. Ideologically, I am the new Bernard Manning. (Unfortunately, the resemblance doesn't end there.)</p> <p>Many of the messages I've since received on Twitter have been accompanied by the hashtags #racist and #sexist and, in one charming case, #youdumbbitch. This is why I read with particular interest about Rowan Atkinson's launch of the <a href=\"http://reformsection5.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Reform Section 5</a> campaign, to repeal that part of the Public Order Act that makes it a crime to use \"abusive or insulting\" words within earshot (or eyeshot) of anyone likely to be offended by them. I would quite like this section to be reformed, in time for me to swerve jail.</p> <p>The sexism charge was nuanced; some believe that Lucy Liu's casting as \"Doctor Joan Watson\" is a positive step for women in Hollywood; I do not, and those who disagree think I must therefore be a misogynist. Fine; give me a couple of hours round a pub table and I'll have that debate with pleasure.</p> <p>But the racism charge was based on the following two paragraphs, which appeared about halfway through my column:</p> <p>\"Lucy Liu [told] the <em>Times</em>, 'It was a very big deal for me to play an Asian-American in <em>Charlie's Angels</em>; Watson's ethnicity is also a big deal', as if someone had bet her \u00a3100 that she couldn't cause at least three Conan Doyle fans to suffer a pulmonary embolism.</p> <p>\"Personally, I'd like to press Liu's face into a bowl of cold pea soup for that statement. It's not just her failure to distinguish between creating a new character and mangling a beloved old one (Tread softly! You tread on my dreams!), but the triumphant tone over such an appalling and offensive racial change. Let me be clear: I rather like the idea of an Asian Watson, but <em>American?</em> God save us all.\"</p> <p>Now, I think it's fairly obvious that this is a silly joke about Americans, as imagined by a tweedy old fan of Victorian literature. It is not a difficult joke to spot. It's a standard structure: set up an expectation based on one half of a sentence (or, in this case, word), then say something based on the other half. As in: \"My boyfriend's got a dog. I'm revolted by the hairiness and the smell. But I like his dog.\"</p> <p>My furious online correspondents, however, reacted as though the last two sentences simply weren't there, managing somehow to take those lines as a statement of anti-Asian feeling. If I were more famous, the <em>Daily Mail</em> would have reported the complaints under the headline \"COREN IN RACE ROW\" and I would have been marked down forever as that woman who used to host a quiz show until her hatred of Asians was revealed and she was forced into hiding forever.</p> <p>As it is, I will be remembered as a racist only by those too daft to get my silly joke, and those who saw the damning internet blogs that failed to quote exactly what I'd said.</p> <p>Nevertheless, those people were genuinely offended. Some may be quite stupid (\"How can you defend the BBC's male-dominated, all-white <em>Sherlock</em>?\" asked one angry lady, the answer to which is so obvious that I couldn't be bothered to type it) \u2013 but I deliberately allowed readers to believe for two seconds that I was about to make an anti-Asian statement, in the full knowledge that some people <em>are</em> stupid and that even so familiar and simple a comic U-turn might be too much for them. Technically, and illegally, I invited offence.</p> <p>Last week, a caller to the Jeremy Vine show on Radio 2 said that Andrew Mitchell should be jailed for swearing at the police because \"there is too little respect for them\".</p> <p>As someone who remembers from childhood the timid, furtive voices of east European cousins on the phone \u2013 those few who had survived the concentration camps \u2013 who dared not speak freely from behind the Iron Curtain because they feared being tapped and followed, I am <em>extremely</em> offended by the suggestion that my own beautiful British society should become a police state, in which rudeness to these authority figures is punished by incarceration. But do I think the caller should be jailed for offending me? No, I think there should be no such thing as a speech crime. However foul a thing you want to say, you can say it freely as far as I'm concerned. And I'm including the skinheads who shouted \"Yid\" at me during my grandfather's funeral.</p> <p>Yet, even if you believe that offensive remarks should be proscribed by law, what about remarks that are <em>misunderstood </em>as offensive? It's nigh impossible to speak without any risk of misinterpretation, especially when mobs are out there looking to be outraged.</p> <p>You don't have to support the campaign to reform Section 5. But one day, your teasing dig in a colleague's leaving card will be taken the wrong way; or your mobile phone comment will be misheard by passers-by in a crowded street; and then they will come for you.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLcSFEsPMI0\" title=\"\">The video</a> is helpfully called <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLcSFEsPMI0&amp;feature=plcp\" title=\"\">\"Danny Rose is lying to whom?\"</a> and, true, anyone clicking on the Serbian football association's website to watch it may find it difficult to understand what all the fuss is about. Which is what happens, funnily enough, when the people in control of editing obediently decide not to include the most damning footage.</p> <p>It is clever \u2013 not as clever as they think but enough to pull some people in undoubtedly. The blurb reads: \"Danny Rose said: 'Every time I touched the ball, they were doing the monkey chanting'. As you can see in this video, there was no unsportsmanlike cheering or insulting players on racial grounds.\" The video lasts six minutes and shows various clips of Rose with possession of the ball. A few whistles can be heard but nothing sinister.</p> <p>You get the drift.</p> <p>As for what happens towards the end of the match, we will have to join the dots ourselves because the point at which everything starts to get really moody is, coincidentally, the precise moment when the video stops. Nothing that follows the 76th minute makes the cut. No monkey chants, none of that loud, aggressive, ooh-oohing that provided the soundtrack for England Under-21s' match in Krusevac and, inconveniently for the host nation, is now all over the internet. Nothing to see here is the message, nothing but a \"sports atmosphere, full of respecting fair-play spirit\".</p> <p>Nobody is fooled and the Football Association has every justification to stick a black marker pen through Serbia's name when it comes to deciding its friends and future opponents. Even ignoring the racism from the stands, England's goalkeeper, Jack Butland, collected enough stones from his goalmouth to feel like Matthias in <em>Life of Brian</em>. England have never been back to Madrid <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2004/nov/17/minutebyminute.sport\" title=\"\">since the friendly against Spain in 2004</a> but, if anything, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi6ySz8Cakg&amp;feature=related\" title=\"\">what happened in the Stadion Mladost</a> was even more&#xa0;spiteful.</p> <p>Serbia are repeat offenders and the denials, including these crass attempts to discredit Rose, simply create the perception they would prefer screw-you defiance and feigned hardship than accept what is blindingly obvious. The Lance Armstrong tactic, if you like, or the John Terry one in football terms.</p> <p>It reeks and, plainly, Serbia deserve a higher than usual form of punishment but remember, too, this is Uefa we are talking about, where the thinking is so jumbled that Porto were fined \u20ac20,000 because of the abuse their supporters directed at Mario Balotelli in last season's Europa League, whereas Manchester City were ordered to pay \u20ac30,000 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/apr/11/manchester-city-fined-porto-racism\" title=\"\">for being 30 seconds late out</a> of the tunnel for another match. It is a nonsense and who, seriously, would back Uefa's control and disciplinary body to get it right when it meets on 22&#xa0;November?</p> <p>The answer, of course, is barely nobody even if, at the same time, scepticism has to be balanced by the sense that English football, for all the outrage, is not exactly in a great position&#xa0;to lecture anybody right now. Yes, Uefa's punishments rank somewhere between absurd and abysmal but at least the organisation makes them public and fronts it up. Chelsea, in stark contrast, will not even disclose how much they have fined Terry after following up the&#xa0;player's apology (an apology of sorts, anyway, given that it did not mention Anton Ferdinand once) by confirming they have taken their own disciplinary action.</p> <p>It was club policy, they said, to do these things behind the scenes. Which is true, loosely speaking, but still pretty flimsy bearing in mind the hypocrisies at play here. A football club cannot seriously talk of a \"zero-tolerance\" policy towards discrimination but then, more or less, turn a blind eye when it is one of their own. Or maybe they can.</p> <p>Terry, we know, has kept the club captaincy. The Professional Footballers' Association would have to be approached if the fine went beyond two weeks' wages but has heard nothing. In other words, zero-tolerance in Terry's case means, at most, a fortnight's salary. \"He has put a little bit of a cloud over the image of the club,\" was pretty much as far as the manager, Roberto Di Matteo, was willing to tiptoe. Try a storm that Thor himself might have summoned.</p> <p>The whole thing is deeply unsatisfactory but Chelsea are not alone when it comes to double standards. A mentality seems to exist whereby clubs and indeed many supporters are quite happy to back the anti-racism campaigns, wear the Kick It Out badges, stick up the posters, tut&#xa0;disapprovingly about the stories from eastern Europe and say all the right things until, of course, that awkward moment when it actually involves their own.</p> <p>It is a hive-mind culture, first with Luis Su\u00e1rez, now with Terry, accompanied by the blinding club loyalties that compel so many people to attack, like zombies, anybody who dares to question or, heaven forbid, criticise.</p> <p>Just recall what happened to Herman Ouseley, chairman of Kick It Out, after he had the temerity to question Liverpool's handling of the Su\u00e1rez case. Ouseley, you see, is on the board of the Manchester United Foundation and that meant, despite the fact that he is a Millwall supporter, the 67-year-old was automatically depicted as the enemy for many Liverpool supporters. Ouseley estimates he received around 300 emails threatening damage on him, containing racist slurs and other insults \u2013 though nothing, strangely, when it was his evidence that sank Rio Ferdinand in the United defender's \"choc-ice\" case.</p> <p>Where we can be grateful, clearly, is that the scenes in the Mladost would never happen in England now. All the same, let's not be too pleased with ourselves when there are black players openly talking about boycotting Kick It Out and the PFA because they perceive them as weak and unsupportive.</p> <p>Last weekend an Oldham Athletic player, Lee Croft, was accused of calling one of Sheffield United's ballboys the N-word. Though Croft denies it, the boy in question, aged 14, was visibly upset. Two Shrewsbury players, Marvin Morgan and Jermaine Grandison, complained of being racially abused at Hartlepool last month. Marvin Sordell of Bolton Wanderers did likewise after a game at Millwall two weekends ago. For speaking out, a mocked-up photograph was sent to his Facebook account showing a gun pointing towards the 21-year-old and blood splattered across his face and shirt. Grammar uncorrected, the message was: \"dont fuck with the millwall\". Patrice Evra, Su\u00e1rez's victim, is now booed routinely at Anfield. Anton Ferdinand has received death threats and a bullet in the post. And on and on. He doesn't want the publicity, but I also know of one ex-England international who is taking his coaching badges abroad because he doesn't think there are opportunities for black managers in his own country.</p> <p>The authorities need to be stronger \u2013 however it is dressed up, the FA's four-match ban for Terry is pitiful \u2013 and a conversation with Uefa's head of communications, David Farrelly, did at least encourage the sense that behind the scenes the relevant people are aware of how the organisation is perceived. He said Uefa is actually putting an awful lot of money, time and effort into promoting anti\u2011racism campaigns, with 227 different events taking place as part of the two\u2011week Football Against Racism in Europe action programme.</p> <p>That is all very good but sooner or later a team, or a player, will walk off the pitch and the impression Uefa gives is that the punishment for the victim would be greater than for the offender. Think back to Michel Platini's response when asked about the prospect of Balotelli doing just this in Euro 2012. His reply was a belter. \"It's a yellow card,\" Uefa's president pointed out.</p> <p>Then consider Uefa's own media coverage of what happened in Krusevac, the Pravda-style operation to airbrush out anything bad for business and what it says about how the organisation works. \"The only negative for England was that Rose saw red for a second yellow card after the final whistle,\" the match report on Uefa's website stated, in the final sentence of 300-plus words. There were no details of what had led to it or what followed. Serbia had been backed by a \"fervent\" crowd. That is one word for it.</p> <p>The problem for Uefa is that it talks a good game but the credibility of its disciplinary processes has been damaged to the point it is now seen as part of the problem rather than part of the solution. The last time Serbian supporters racially abused England players, in the European Under-21 Championship in 2007, the initial fine was \u20ac24,000. What was largely unreported at the time was that Uefa appealed against the judgment of its own organisation, arguing it was too lenient. The appeal was successful and the fine was subsequently increased \u2013 by \u20ac6,500.</p> <p>Which pretty much says it all.</p>",
  "<p>People used to wonder whether Theresa May was tough enough to be home secretary. But in the week <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19922026\" title=\"\">Andrew Mitchell</a> buckled and bowed out and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/19/george-osborne-inspector-train-ticket\" title=\"\">George Osborne</a> was caught travelling with the wrong train ticket, May's reputation has risen to new heights. As the Tories struggle to escape being seen as a bunch of arrogant public school boys who imagine they can insult police officers and ticket inspectors with impunity, May's political persona suddenly looks very attractive.</p> <p>In place of a swaggering born-to-rule contempt for lesser mortals, the home secretary has shown a steely determination to defend a Briton of humble origins, namely the computer hacker <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/gary-mckinnon-feels-set-free\" title=\"\">Gary McKinnon</a>, whom she saved from being extradited to the United States. The Americans are furious about this. They take a dim view of McKinnon's activities, which included hacking into a large number of their military computers, and they were confident that May was going to hand him over. Perhaps they should have studied more carefully an earlier episode in May's career, when she first showed her willingness to defy powerful interests.</p> <p>On that previous occasion, May's target was her own party. In her speech as Tory chairman to the party conference held in Bournemouth in the autumn of 2002, she told Conservatives: \"Twice we went to the country unchanged, unrepentant, just plain unattractive. And twice we got slaughtered. Soldiering on to the next election without radical, fundamental change is simply not an option.\" She urged the Tories to face the fact that they were seen as \"the nasty party\" and to commit themselves to looking like 21st-century Britain instead of hankering after \"some mythical place called Middle England\" and descending into \"Punch and Judy politics\", \"glib moralising\" and \"hypocritical finger-wagging\".</p> <p>This speech caused enormous and lasting resentment. Even today there are Tories who \"can never forgive her for that nonsense\", as one of them put it to me. May stood accused of having \"done a Gerald Ratner\": of having rubbished her own brand. But she came through this storm of criticism \u2013 and another following serious problems with border control last Autumn \u2013 without buckling and today it is Mitchell and Osborne, not May, who are accused of damaging the Tory brand. How Ed Miliband delighted, during prime minister's questions last Wednesday, in pointing out that Mitchell, after abusing a police officer at the Downing Street gates, went off to dine at the Carlton Club, an institution redolent of traditional conservatism.</p> <p>May would be most unlikely to have done either of these things. Although determined to reform the police, she does not go around swearing at individual officers and she is certainly not a fan of the Carlton Club. As party chairman, she refused to take up the honorary membership of the club that was offered to her. More recently, the website <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/\" title=\"\">Conservative Home </a>asked, as one of a series of short questions designed to reveal what kind of Tory she is, whether she would prefer to go for a night out at \"the Carlton Club or Stringfellows\"?</p> <p>The home secretary replied: \"Oh come on! I've got, I've got [laughter] objections to Stringfellows as the minister for women and equalities [at that time another of her ministerial responsibilities] and I'm afraid the Carlton Club, hmm. My night out would be with my husband, wherever he chose to take me.\"</p> <p>This refusal to allow herself to be pigeonholed is characteristic. In the same interview, she was asked which book she would prefer to read \u2013 Edmund Burke's <em>Reflections on the Revolution in France</em> or Louise Bagshawe's <em>Desire</em>: a choice between one of the greatest works of conservatism and a piece of chick-lit by a woman who has since changed her name to Louise Mensch. May just replied: \"I wouldn't read either of them, sorry.\"</p> <p>Many people have testified that lunch or dinner with May can be a sadly unrewarding experience. \"It was hard to get a word out of her,\" one Tory said. She does not gossip or leak or betray any desire to discuss political ideas. A Tory woman said of May: \"She's not at all unpleasant. She's just not cosy.\" When this woman described herself as \"a good friend\" of May's, another Tory woman retorted: \"Yes, but would you discuss having your legs waxed with her?\"</p> <p>In a recent interview, which was adorned with photographs of her as a child, so was presumably meant to reveal more about her, May said: \"I am a practising member of the Church of England, a vicar's daughter.\" Her father, the Reverend Hubert Brasier, was killed in a car accident just after May left university, but again, she vouchsafes no details, a reticence that would not be shown by most politicians.</p> <p>May was born in 1956 and educated at Holton Park girls' grammar school, at Wheatley in Oxfordshire, which became Wheatley Park comprehensive school in her last year. She read geography at Oxford, where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/benazir-bhutto\" title=\"\">Benazir Bhutto </a>(a future prime minister of Pakistan, assassinated in 2007) introduced May to her future husband, Philip May: \"I hate to say this, but it was at an Oxford University Conservative Association disco\u2026 this is wild stuff. He was a good debater and Benazir had got to know him through that.\"</p> <p>After leaving Oxford, May worked for a time at the Bank of England. She became a councillor in south London and fought two parliamentary seats before winning Maidenhead in 1997. All this sounds rather humdrum, but at Westminster her ability to run things was soon recognised. In 1999, she became the first of the 1997 intake to be appointed to the shadow cabinet.</p> <p>But although respected by Tory party managers as a safe pair of hands, and one of the few competent women in the parliamentary party, it cannot be said she possessed the linguistic gifts to make a wider reputation in opposition. Nor did she seem anxious to cultivate a broad range of contacts. Unlike many politicians, she does not spend her time trying to be loved or building a power base. On many evenings, she could be seen having dinner with her husband, who is a banker. They have been married for 32 years and have no children.</p> <p>It was perhaps to avert the danger of being regarded as unbearably dull that May began to wear exceptionally smart shoes. But although her footwear gave journalists something to write about, it also suggested to ignorant observers that May might be a rather empty-headed person, who cared only about amassing a large collection of shoes.</p> <p>This prejudice has been dispelled by her tenure since 2010 of the Home Office. The department is a perilous one, which many politicians have left under a cloud. May has thrived there. As David Ruffley, a Tory who, like May was first elected in 1997 and who knows the Home Office from having worked there before that as Ken Clarke's special adviser, put it: \"She has developed a reputation for being a very tough operator and an incredibly successful Whitehall warrior. She has not only got Home Office civil servants to bow to her will, but has fought her corner incredibly effectively against other cabinet ministers such as Vince Cable.\"</p> <p>May has pressed forward with two main projects: curbing immigration and reforming the police. It is not yet possible to say whether she will achieve either objective, but on her own back-benches she is respected for making a good start. On the police front, her appointment of Tom Winsor to produce a rigorous review of pay and conditions, and then to serve as the first non-policeman ever to be made chief inspector of constabulary, is confirmation that she is serious. The police have not so far been able to get up a campaign against her as they did against some of her predecessors and against Mitchell.</p> <p>The job of home secretary involves a number of dangerous decisions in which it is necessary to cut through a tangle of political and legal considerations in order to achieve clarity. This is what May did in the case of McKinnon. She was rewarded with praise from all sides of the House, with the notable exception of her predecessor as home secretary, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/9618928/Alan-Johnson-Home-Secretary-Theresa-May-took-the-easy-way-out.html\" title=\"\">Alan Johnson</a>, who declared in a subsequent article: \"The US was entitled to request and expect extradition. Theresa May has not reached a brave decision, she's taken the easy way out.\"</p> <p>Naturally, there is speculation that May, despite or even because of her opacity, might one day be the new, more classless face the Tory party needs. Could she follow Angela Merkel, another undemonstrative daughter of a clergyman, and become her country's leader? I admit I would find this astonishing: May has the necessary toughness , but I do not see that she has the oratorical gifts. But I should at once add that it is easy to make the error of underestimating May.</p>",

  "<p>The future of Scotland Yard's pioneering anti-trafficking unit is uncertain less than a year after David Cameron promised to make Britain a \"world leader\" in the fight against people smuggling.</p> <p>Senior police sources have voiced fears that the Metropolitan police's flagship trafficking unit, the human exploitation and organised crime command (SCD9), may be forced to lose specialist officers due to budget constraints. Government figures last week showed the number being trafficked into the UK was rising. But immigration minister Mark Harper warned that the number of those being prosecuted was still \"not enough\".</p> <p>Campaigners say any attempt to downsize the specialist unit for tackling trafficking would undermine the Met's fight to stop organised trafficking syndicates operating in the UK.</p> <p>A Met source said: \"The reality is that no one knows what is going to be happening to the unit as from next April. The sort of refined modelling around the cuts, which we know are coming, has left staff numbers up in the air.\" Although the positions of up to three anti-trafficking officers are guaranteed for the next two years, following the granting of EU funding last month, financial shortfalls meant two jobs from the unit were lost last month with the rest of the officers in the trafficking unit undecided.</p> <p>Christine Beddoe, director of the anti-trafficking charity ECPAT UK, said: \"The trafficking team in the Met needs to be beefed up, it is clear we need more specialist officers tackling the crime.\"</p> <p>Cameron has said that trafficking is a coalition priority and several days ago the Home Office said \"more work than ever before is being carried out both in the UK and internationally to prosecute criminals and stop trafficking gangs in their tracks\". Yet in 2011 there were only eight convictions for human trafficking in the UK.</p> <p>Last year, SCD9 rescued 85 potential victims of trafficking during visits to scores of brothels. In addition, 60 women were referred to the unit from voluntary organisations, of whom 39 were confirmed as being trafficked. SCD9 was though given \u00a3600,000 to tackle the expected increase in trafficking during the London Olympics, but research is expected to say that few sex workers travelled to the capital because of the 2012 Olympics.</p> <p>Anthony Steen, chairman of the Human Trafficking Foundation, said that intensive policing levels were required to tackle the crime: \"Traffickers run far ahead of law enforcement agencies, using modern technology and sophisticated</p> <p>recruitment networks to avoid detection,\" he said.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>This article was amended on 20 October 2012. The future of the unit is uncertain but decisions on its overall fate have yet to be made. This has been clarified in relevant places throughout the story and in the standfirst.</em></p>",

  "<p>A wealthy Vietnamese woman sits at a roadside cafe and prepares a dish for her own consumption. She is grinding up rhino horn. After a few minutes, water is added and she drinks the mixture out of a shot glass as a cure for her kidney stones. The woman paid several thousand US dollars for the piece of horn. The rhino died.</p> <p>The image is one of a series taken by <a href=\"http://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit-us/whats-on/temporary-exhibitions/wpy/photo.do?photo=2898&amp;category=58&amp;group=3\" title=\"\">South African photographer Brent Stirton, who won an award at the 2012 Veolia Environnement Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibition</a>, which opened at the Natural History Museum London on Friday. Entitled \"Deadly Medicine: Rhinos\", the six photographs in his award-winning portfolio depict the impact of poaching on the world, from game rangers in action to end users of rhino horn who believe it to be a medicine.</p> <p>Poaching has become a major part of organised global crime and so well organised that it threatens to wipe out some of the world's five remaining species of rhinos. Two of them, the Javan and the Sumatran, have been reduced to populations of only a few dozen each. Populations of the other three \u2013 black, white and one-horned rhinos \u2013 are also threatened.</p> <p>\"The illegal trade in wildlife is now the third largest criminal industry in the world and rhino poaching plays a key role,\" Stirton told the <em>Observer</em>.</p> <p>\"It is driven by the growing affluence in Asian countries, particularly Vietnam and China, where people have believed for centuries that rhino horn can cure many illnesses, including cancer. The belief is part of their culture and deep rooted, and therefore very difficult to dislodge.\"</p> <p>The Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibition is now in its 48th year and has earned a reputation for its superb images that glorify nature. However, new categories have been introduced in recent years to allow photographers to feature more uncomfortable truths about humanity's impact on the planet. One winner last year captured the devastating effect of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill on wildlife, for example. This year's exhibition includes a chilling account of the plight of rhinos. Driven by soaring prices for rhino horn, the number of animals slaughtered has soared.</p> <p>In 2007 only 13 rhinos were killed by poachers; last year that figure rose to 448 \u2013 more than in any previous year. This year a total of 455 have been slaughtered so far, it was revealed last week by the government of South Africa, where 90% of all rhinos live. Most of these animals \u2013 272 of the 455 \u2013 were killed in the country's Kruger National Park and were white rhinos, the least threatened species. It is believed there are around 20,000 left in the wild.</p> <p>Stirton visited parks across South Africa to take his images, which include one of a vet's assistant holding up the horn of a tranquillised white rhino from a game farm outside Klerksdorp. Its horns have been removed to save it from poachers. \"Cutting off a horn can be an effective way of making a rhino safe from hunters,\" said Richard Sabin, a wildlife expert at the Natural History Museum. \"The animal no longer has value. On the other hand, a horn has only to grow back a few centimetres before it becomes lucrative enough to make it worthwhile for a poacher to go back and kill a rhino. That is a reflection of the enormous prices that rhino horn can now command.\"</p> <p>However, it is the image of the Vietnamese woman drinking rhino horn liquor that provides the most striking image in Stirton's portfolio. Her enjoyment at her task contrasts vividly with the blood shed to obtain that piece of horn. Getting the picture took considerable ingenuity.</p> <p>\"I posed as a Canadian who was trying to set up his own illegal market in my home country,\" said Stirton. \"I persuaded the dealer, who is in the background, to let me see someone preparing it so that I would know what to do to set up my own market when I got back to Canada. She is grinding the horn in a dish specially made for the purpose. It has a rhino symbol on the side and has a rough base on which to grind the horn into powder. After a few minutes, water was added and she swallowed it. The woman told me she took it daily for her general health. The interesting thing is that rhino horn is an illegal substance in Vietnam. But both the woman and her dealer had no fear of the police and happily ground the rhino horn in full view of the street. The dealer told me he paid $1,500 a month to the right people so he could sell rhino horn with impunity.\"</p> <p>The rising slaughter of the world's endangered rhinos is particularly ironic given the makeup of their horns, added Sabin. \"Their horns are made of keratin. That is the stuff from which hair, fingernails and toenails are made. In other words, chewing your own fingernails would do you as much as good as taking powdered rhino horn, and at least that would avoid the slaughter of rhinos.\"</p> <p><em>The Veolia Environnement Wildlife Photographer of the Year is at the Natural History Museum until 3 March 2013, before embarking on a global tour. </em></p>",
  "<p>As Republican challenger Mitt Romney addressed a throng of supporters in the Virginian town of Leesburg last week, he started to rattle through a list of campaign promises. \"When I become president\" he began. Then he paused and regarded the crowd for a moment before repeating the first word with extra emphasis. \"<em>When</em> I become president, we are finally going to cut spending,\" he said, to shouts of approval.</p> <p>It would have fallen flat just a few weeks ago. The former Massachusetts governor's campaign was emerging from a disastrous summer. It was firmly behind in the polls, had been savaged by an efficient Democrat attack machine and been hit by the release of a secret videotape revealing <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/27/obama-campaign-fresh-attack-romney\" title=\"\">Romney dismissing 47% of Americans </a>as dependent on government. Many observers, including some panicking Republicans, were writing him off as a rightwing version of Michael Dukakis, another former Massachusetts governor, who was soundly beaten by George Bush in 1988.</p> <p>But that was then. In Leesburg, Romney appeared relaxed and confident, cracking jokes and launching attacks against President Barack Obama's economic record. He turned on the charm, too. \"There is so much about this country I love,\" he gushed, before reciting a litany of inspiring anecdotes collected from his many months on the campaign trail. \"We are going to win Virginia, you know that? We are going to win,\" he said.</p> <p>He has grounds for optimism. After Obama's disastrous performance in the first presidential debate \u2013 and Romney's solid, warm showing \u2013 the 2012 election has upended itself. For two weeks a flood of polls has detailed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/08/romney-gains-lead-obama-poll\" title=\"\">a surge in Romney's support</a>. A Gallup tracking survey has him seven points in the lead nationally, beating Obama by 52% to 45%. In the key battlegrounds of Virginia and Florida, Romney is back in the game. He is closing the gap in Wisconsin, which many had seen as out of reach. Even in Pennsylvania, which no one had seen as up for grabs, one recent poll had him ahead. In North Carolina, which narrowly went for Obama in 2008, Romney's team is now so confident of victory that it has started moving out staff and redeploying them to Ohio.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398115699\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/21/1350780966864/US-key-election-battlegro-001.jpg\" alt=\"US key election battlegrounds\" width=\"460\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US key election battlegrounds. Photograph: Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Romney campaign, which all summer seemed on the defensive, is suddenly aggressively on the attack. It is hammering away at the issue of Obama's economic record, ignoring signs of a gradual recovery and instead repeatedly referring to high unemployment, millions of people on food stamps and growing poverty. It is a message that strikes a chord with many people still suffering from the impact of the recession.</p> <p>Certainly in the Leesburg crowd no one was talking about good times being ahead. \"He was a governor of a Democratic state and if he was able to get things done there, then he could get things done anywhere. He should be able to make things happen on a national scale,\" said Diane Senyitko, 52, whose construction business has been hit hard for more than five years of economic turmoil.</p> <p>\"Obama already had his chance. If he was going to bring about a recovery, it would have happened already,\" she said. Indeed, Senyitko is now campaigning for Romney, knocking on doors all over Leesburg and trying to win people over. \"I see a lot of enthusiasm that I did not see before. I don't even think it will be neck and neck at the end. It will be a big win,\" she said.</p> <p>That is probably unlikely. Obama is still \u2013 when all the polls are taken into consideration \u2013 likely to be narrowly ahead. But the race has certainly shifted and the prospect of a Romney win has gone from a poor joke to a perfectly realistic prospect. \"The chances that Romney will win have gotten a lot better,\" said Professor Kevin Leicht, a political expert at the University of Iowa.</p> <p>Now stories of internal dissent within the Romney camp have been replaced with accounts of a \"happy warrior\" candidate, comfortable at the end of an almost six-year quest to get to the White House. Party bigwigs \u2013 once critical of his campaign \u2013 have lined up loyally behind him. So have evangelical leaders, who privately remain sceptical because he is a Mormon. Media critics have fallen silent. Even Karl Rove, President George W. Bush's old guru, has been speculating enthusiastically on Romney's chances of winning the White House back for a party that in 2008 was seen as headed for a lengthy period in the wilderness. Already some have begun to speculate on what that would mean for America and the rest of the world. \"He will run this country like the chief executive of a large corporation,\" said Steven Mitchell, a Republican pollster and founder of Mitchell Research.</p> <p>What you think of that prospect depends on your politics. Liberals would see such a thing as a return to the worst excesses from before the recession. Romney has pledged to deregulate Wall Street again and lower corporate taxes. He preaches the sort of \"trickle down\" economics of the 1980s that Ronald Reagan did, glorifying the wealthy and seeing tax breaks for them as having a broader economic benefit.</p> <p>He wants to scrap Obama's healthcare reforms and take an axe to every part of government, except the military. Liberals fear all this will make America even more unequal, risk another financial meltdown and hurt the lowest levels of society for whom federal help is vital.</p> <p>They also worry Romney will be beholden to the desires of the broader Republican party, especially in Congress, which, stuffed with Tea Party zealots and social conservatives, is far more rightwing than his presidential campaign. They worry the party will force Romney to extremes on everything from monetary policy to abortion, immigration and gay rights. \"They have already influenced Romney in unfavourable ways. The prospects of going back to a pre-2008 environment are very real,\" said Leicht, referring to the extreme stances Romney adopted in order to win his party's nomination.</p> <p>Republicans, obviously, see it differently. They see Romney as unshackling business, sparking broader economic growth and cutting out unnecessary spending that will reduce the deficit. They see Romney rescuing America from the fate of Greece and other heavily indebted European nations. \"There will be a sea change from the current administration. People will invest in things again,\" said Mitchell.</p> <p>It might not be so easy, though. As Obama has found, America's system of government appears designed to end in deadlock. Republican intransigence stymied much of Obama's own domestic agenda. There is little reason to think Romney will fare any better if Democrats still control either part of Congress. Even with \"Obamacare\", Romney might not actually be able to fulfil his party's dreams by scrapping it altogether. \"You can't just repeal it and not replace it with anything,\" said Leicht. Indeed much of Obamacare was based on Romney's own health reforms in Massachusetts. Such \"flip flops\" have long marked his political career and that makes predicting a Romney first term especially difficult: it has never been clear what his core beliefs are. \"In the short term it is going to be hard for him to do very much at all. America's problems are actually too big for either candidate to solve easily,\" Leicht said.</p> <p>Of course there is still a long way to go. Though the Obama campaign has been rocked by the sudden upturn in Romney's fortunes, it remains on top of the race overall. Aside from Gallup, other polls have Obama narrowly ahead or statistically tied at a national level. More important are surveys coming out of the swing states which show Obama still ahead, especially in the midwestern heartland of Ohio.</p> <p>Among all the battlegrounds, it is Ohio that is most important. No Republican has ever won the White House without also winning Ohio and Obama is still solidly ahead there. Obama's operation in the state is huge and well-funded. Both Obama and the first lady have been regular visitors: his entire re-election campaign was launched in the state capital of Columbus. Bill Clinton has been touring the state. Even Bruce Springsteen has been deployed there. If Romney's advance can be stopped in Ohio, the main Democratic campaign argument runs, then it will be halted everywhere. But, essentially, the race for the Oval Office is now on a knife edge.</p> <p>Only a few milestones remain, chief of which is Monday night's third and final debate in Florida. Yet, with its topic of foreign policy, that is unlikely to prove too much of a game-changer given that the electorate's overriding concern is jobs and the economy. \"Honestly, put a gun to my head right now and ask me to pick a winner? I just don't know,\" said Mitchell.</p> <p>But in Leesburg they think they do. Around 8,000 people gathered to hear Romney speak in a park, enjoying the last warm days of autumn. After so much time campaigning and wooing the different camps of his party, Romney appeared to have finally stitched it all together behind him.</p> <p>Take local IT specialist Matthew Russell, 49. He had begun supporting pizza magnate Herman Cain during the party's bitter nomination race, then favoured former House speaker Newt Gingrich. \"Romney was my last choice,\" he confessed. But he was OK with things now, because Romney was offering the one thing that really does unite the party: he might beat Obama. \"If the election was held tomorrow, then I think it would be Obama to win, but if the momentum keeps up this way then I think Romney will eke it out in November,\" he said.</p> <p>If Romney does win, it will not have been pretty. The 2012 election has seen Obama launch one of the most negative campaigns in recent memory claiming Romney is a heartless plutocrat who wants to take America back to the post civil war era satirised by Mark Twain as the Gilded Age. In response, Romney has painted Obama as a dangerous pseudo-socialist taking America on the path to ruin. But if, come 6 November, it is Romney who emerges victorious then neither he nor anyone else in his party will care. In Leesburg, Romney ended his speech with a rousing call to arms. \"We are taking back America,\" he told the crowd. \"America is coming back, we are going to have a real recovery.\"</p> <p>Watching the speech was estate agent Kim Levy, 38. She has been ignoring the polls in favour of a less scientific study of support. The local 7-11 convenience stores have been running a promotion whereby cups of soda feature a picture of Romney or Obama. \"All the Romney cups are gone and all the Obama ones are still there, except maybe one. It's like that at all the 7-11s in Leesburg. All of them,\" she said with undisguised glee.</p>",
  "<h2>Paul Birtill is director of the <a href=\"https://www.metropolitan.org.uk/about-us/initiatives/migration-foundation/\" title=\"\">Metropolitan Migration Foundation</a></h2> <p><strong>It's important to take a whole community approach:</strong> Otherwise it has the potential to antagonise the local communities where we work.</p> <p><strong>Housing providers are not very good campaigning bodies:</strong> They don't have that experience. That is not to say they shouldn't raise their voice on humanitarian issues: everyone has that responsibility. But what they do have is housing and the expertise to acquire and manage more housing, such as leased accommodation through the private rented sector.</p> <p><strong>Questions housing providers should ask themselves: </strong>What are the migration-related issues in your community? What expertise can a housing association offer as a practical solution, with partners? Migration issues are about community issues and the whole community.</p> <h2>Sue Lukes is a director of <a href=\"http://www.migrationwork.org/\" title=\"\">Migration Work CIC</a> and co-authors of <a href=\"http://www.housing-rights.info/index.php\" title=\"\">housing-rights.info</a></h2> <p><strong>Service availability regardless of immigration status:</strong> Housing authorities have the duty to provide advice to anyone facing homelessness or in housing need, which includes those who may have no rights to go on waiting lists or get housed as homeless. All too often, migrants are turned away from council services and given no advice. Or no arrangements are made to provide advice that is accessible or appropriate for them.</p> <p><strong>Schools data is one of the best sources of information about new arrivals:</strong> Housing providers can liaise with schools and education authorities to ensure that it is shared with providers, and collected well.</p> <p><strong>Key points of action:</strong> Set yourselves up at strategic and all other levels to learn and keep learning, from migrants as from others, and to believe that that is more important than knowing. Also, ensure that you include migrants among your equalities targets and encourage imaginative ways of meeting those targets.</p> <h2>John Perry is a policy advisor at the <a href=\"http://www.cih.org/\" title=\"\">Chartered Institute of Housing</a></h2> <p><strong>The word 'migrant' is a turn-off: </strong>It signals someone who is probably not entitled to housing and welfare benefits. But of course most migrants eventually become entitled and six per cent of people going into new lettings are people born abroad, so their needs are an issue which should interest everone.</p> <p><strong>A lack of interest among larger landlords?</strong> At one meeting, what struck me was that there was only one large landlord, Metropolitan, and several small housing associations, all from the black and minority ethnic (BME) sector, including two Irish associations. It's excellent that BME associations are interested in migration issues, often around communities they didn't originally represent. But it rather highlights the lower interest among bigger associations with more resources.</p> <p><strong>The minister must recognise what an urgent problem destitution is: </strong>The previous minister launched his attack on rogue landlords, but they way it was launched made it seem like an attack on migrants, with police officers making early morning raids. We need to recognise that we not only have a humanitarian crisis because of destitution, but one which is bound to affect community relations too.</p> <p><strong>Migration affects housing demand:</strong> But, it is only one of many factors and if migration stopped tomorrow new housing supply would only meet only about two thirds of projected needs.</p> <h2>Ravinder Kaur is a community cohesion manager at <a href=\"http://www.wmhousing.co.uk/home\" title=\"\">WM Housing Group</a>migra</h2> <p><strong>Rough sleeping: </strong>Some of the issues we have picked up around rough sleeping is due to the lack of support provided to failed asylum seeker appicants. They have no recourse to public funds and are too frightened to seek help and support due to being deported.</p> <h2>Juan Camilo is advocacy support officer for <a href=\"http://www.migrantsrights.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Migrants Rights Network</a></h2> <p><strong>Where are migrants housed?</strong> When they arrive, migrants are overwhelmingly housed in the private rented sector but with time their trends converge with that of the overall population.</p> <p><strong>Welfare reform:</strong> The changes being introduced to the social housing and benefits systems will require renewed efforts to communicate effectively for people, including migrants, to be aware of their rights and entitlements, but also to avoid tensions if it means demographic changes.</p> <p><strong>Temporary housing: </strong>There is an urgent need for temporary housing for destitute migrants. This will mean that charities can work with them to find pathways out of destitution. Without this, the proportion of migrants among the rough sleeping population will continue to increase.</p> <p><strong>New housing markets: </strong>A flexible easy access housing market is needed to respond to mobile populations and economic migrants, but also non-migrants. There is a role here for policy, housing associations and private sector landlords.</p> <p>M<strong>obile migrants:</strong> Highly mobile migrants look for short leases to settle in but it is difficult to find flexible tenancies. The process of renting a place through an estate agent may also be difficult for somebody who has recently arrived. The lack of this market creates an incentive for all sorts of 'alternative arrangements' which are often problematic.</p> <h2>Heather Petch is an independent expert in housing, homelessness, communities and migration<br></h2> <p><strong>Better data:</strong> The need for better data and information is key for planning housing and highlighting where to focus advice and support. This is also needed at local level.</p> <p><strong>Playing politics: </strong>There should be cross-party agreement not to fuel racism and prejudice against migrants by politicians, especially at national level. At local level these sort of protocols are more likely to exist; we found this in Greater Manchester in the Housing and Migration Network's report on leadership.</p> <p><strong>The race to the bottom:</strong> A co-ordinated approach across areas and regions is important so that we avoid a race to the bottom whereby councils worry that it they are more flexible and open in their allocation policies this will mean they attract more applicants for social housing.</p> <p><strong>Impact on housing need: </strong>We must however acknowledge that migration does have an impact on increasing housing need along with growing numbers of households and ageing. All these issues need a new paradigm for housing and planning.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2012/oct/12/live-discussion-housing-migration\" title=\"\"><em>To view the full discussion, click here</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/housing/\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis, best practice and the latest jobs direct to you</strong></p>"
