  "<p>Crab cakes are an American classic \u2013 a dish born of plenty, and served simply, preferably with an ice-cold beer, on a deck overlooking Chesapeake Bay. Sure, they make them elsewhere \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2005/jul/03/foodanddrink.shopping2\">spiked with bird's eye chilli and lime juice in Thailand</a>; served with <a href=\"http://www.atelierdeschefs.co.uk/en/recipe/13853-causa-peruvian-chilli-and-potato-cake-with-crab.php\">cold mashed potato in Peru</a> - but nowhere are they more revered than on the east cost of the US, where they're honoured with festivals, cook-offs and, inevitably, <a href=\"http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2009-09-14/news/0909130097_1_crab-seafood-festival-cakes\">competitive eating events</a>.</p> <p>Crab cakes are a particular speciality of Maryland, as eager Wire-watchers will testify \u2013 McNulty even uses a box as a bribe in season one of the Baltimore-based drama. Interestingly, the Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America suggests that the recipe dates back to the earliest European settlers, who, because of the labour-intensive nature of harvesting crab, would stretch the meagre results by using the meat in \"small fried cakes\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395137103\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/21/1345559237405/Saveur-recipe-crab-cakes-002.jpg\" alt=\"Saveur recipe crab cakes\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saveur recipe crab cakes. Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Such frugal offerings are unlikely to pass muster with today's Americans however \u2013 they rate their crab cakes on the quantity of crustacean. As Tom Douglas, the author of I Love Crab Cakes warns, \"beware the poor fellow who gets dinged for using 'too much filler,' a common reference to too many crumbs in your cake, for he shall hang his head in shame\".</p> <p>In Britain we may not enjoy the same abundance of seafood, but we do produce some great crab at this time of year, albeit of a rather more diminutive nature than they might be used to across the pond. Such a delicacy doesn't deserve to be buried in melted cheese, or overwhelmed with spices: the great thing about the American crab cake is that it really is more crab than cake. So, as our own season reaches its glut, it's time to crack open the claws and get crabbing.</p> <h2>The crab</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395137104\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/21/1345558975849/James-Beard-recipe-crab-c-002.jpg\" alt=\"James Beard recipe crab cake\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Beard recipe crab cake. Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the UK, we don't see much of the blue crab, the American connoisseur's crustacean of choice \u2013 indeed, it's only been <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/cornwall/hi/people_and_places/nature/newsid_8547000/8547289.stm\">sighted twice in British waters</a>. It is <a href=\"http://www.thefishsociety.co.uk/fish-detail_blue-crab-legs_10_200_0_1.html\">available online</a>, but it seemed to make more sense to use a native variety. However, the fresh picked crab I deploy first is mostly shredded too finely to work well in a fish cake of the American sort, which always call for \"jumbo lump crab\" in pieces apparently the size of a gobstopper. This just falls apart in the pan. </p> <p>If you can't find white crab meat in the necessary lumps, you'll have to do the picking yourself: get the biggest beast you can find, and work delicately, concentrating your efforts on claw meat \u2013 there's a <a href=\"http://www.shellfish.org.uk/files/3143SAGB%20crab%20recipe%20book%20final%20LowRes.pdf\">good guide here (pdf)</a>. If you're unable to find fresh crab, I have also experimented with (imported, sadly) tinned lump crab meat which, although the flavour is inevitably not so good, makes a pretty passable cake. </p> <h2>Playing a binder</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395137105\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/21/1345558471055/Old-Bay-recipe-crab-cake-002.jpg\" alt=\"Old Bay recipe crab cake\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Old Bay recipe crab cake. Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As we've established, a properly proud American crab cake relies on there being as little of this as possible. The majority of recipes seem to fall into two distinct camps. The first, like the legendary food writer James Beard, chef and sustainable seafood champion Rick Moonen, Saveur magazine, and the Old Bay seasoning company, who have featured a crab cake recipe on their packaging for as long as anyone can remember, opt for something wheat based \u2013 breadcrumbs, in most cases, but there's also the option of crushed crackers, as in Saveur's, collected from <a href=\"http://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Maryland-Crab-Cakes\">Nick's Inner Harbor Seafood in Baltimore</a>, or flour, as in <a href=\"http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/10/recipe-of-the-day-crabby-crab-cakes/\">Mark Bittman's cakes for the New York Times</a>. I find James Beard's breadcrumb-based recipe, moistened with egg and a little cream, has the best texture of the lot \u2013 the crumbs give a lighter cake than the flour or crackers, which seem to give a slightly soggy effect.</p> <p>The second group, which includes a recipe from swanky New York grocers Dean &amp; Deluca's cookbook, relies only on liquid binders \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.gourmetsleuth.com/Recipes/Crab-Appetizers-828/Perfect-Crab-Cakes-1020.aspx\">mayonnaise and sour cream in their case</a>. I find them rather wet in texture, and the flavour of the mayonnaise too assertive \u2013 the great benefit of bread and flour is that they blend into the background.</p> <p>Some recipes hedge their bets: the <a href=\"http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodlobster.html#crabcakes\">Baltimore crab-flake cakes</a> from 1932's National Cookbook start off with a bechamel, and Rick Moonen makes a sort of cooked mayonnaise base with hot oil and egg yolk, and allows this to cool before stirring in the crab and breadcrumbs. The bechamel isn't quite stiff enough to hold the cakes together well, and Rick's cakes, although fine texturally, are a bit too rich for my taste. The predominant flavour should be that of crab, rather than fat, so I'm sticking with Beard's breadcrumbs, and cutting out his double cream: an egg will do the trick just as well.</p> <h2>Flavourings</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395137106\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/21/1345558814422/Mark-Bittman-recipe-crab--002.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Bittman recipe crab cake\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Bittman recipe crab cake. Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mustard is a very popular choice in crabcakes \u2013 the only recipe I find which doesn't include it is the oldest, which adds Worcestershire sauce instead. Wholegrain, as in the Dean &amp; Deluca recipe, looks pretty as it studs the cakes with seeds, but I think dry powder, as used by James Beard, is better than this or the Dijon in Rick Moonen and Mark Bittman's recipes \u2013 it adds heat without the vinegary tanginess of prepared mustard.</p> <p>I can't taste the yellow mustard in the <a href=\"http://www.oldbay.com/Recipes/Crab/Main-Course/Classic-OLD-BAY-Crab-Cakes.aspx\">Old Bay recipe</a>, in fact, all I can taste is this secret blend of herbs and spices, which was developed in Baltimore in the 1940s as a seasoning for the region's abundant seafood. Its packaging will admit only to celery salt, red and black pepper, and paprika, but I can also pick up nutmeg which, although I find the seasoning itself too pungent, works beautifully with the crab.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395137107\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/21/1345558642059/National-Cookbook-recipe--002.jpg\" alt=\"National Cookbook recipe crab cakes\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">National Cookbook recipe crab cakes. Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I reject both mayonnaise and Worcestershire sauce, which appear in a number of recipes including the Saveur magazine offering and the National Cookbook on the same grounds \u2013 too strident. Herbs are a nice addition however: Beard uses parsley, Old Bay \"parsley flakes\", which I assume means the dried variety, and Rick Moonen parsley, dill and chives. Like the onion he and Beard also add, I find the flavour of the chives too domineering, and I can't pick up the dill, but the pepperiness of the parsley is a nice complement to the seafood, and the white pepper in Beard's seasoning.</p> <p>Rick Moonen admits his recipe is \"a lot longer and more complicated than most of the others\" but insists that he \"made his name on these crab cakes, and they are worth every moment of effort\". The ingredients list is about three times the size of the rest, and includes sauteed red and green pepper along with the onion, fish sauce, Tabasco and lime juice. He's right: the cakes are utterly delicious, but they're not the classic dish I'm after here. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=39555261462\">Moonen's are well worth a try</a> if you're sick of simple, but I'll be sticking with mustard powder, fresh parsley, and a little nutmeg and paprika.</p> <h2>Coating and crunch</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395137108\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/21/1345558061653/Dean--Deluca-recipe-crab--002.jpg\" alt=\"Dean & Deluca recipe crab cakes\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dean & Deluca recipe crab cakes. Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some recipes, like the Dean &amp; Deluca and the Old Bay crabcakes, simply leave them uncoated, but this seems a shame \u2013 a good crunchy crust provides a pleasing contrast to the soft crab meat inside. The National Cookbook and Rick Moonen use breadcrumbs (the latter my favourite panko variety), but again, this strays too close to fishcake territory for my liking. Beard's simple dredging of flour is less obtrusive, and works just as well in this case.</p> <h2>Cooking method</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395137109\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/21/1345559132757/Rick-Moonen-recipe-crab-c-004.jpg\" alt=\"Rick Moonen recipe crab cakes\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rick Moonen recipe crab cakes. Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most crab cakes are, of course, fried. Many restaurants also offer them grilled these days, however, to cater for the more health-conscious diner, an option given on the Old Bay tin, and the Dean &amp; Deluca recipe bakes and then grills them. The grilled, and baked and grilled versions, while nice enough flavourwise, lack the crisp crust of the fried variety, but shallow frying in \u00bc inch oil, as suggested by the Saveur magazine recipe, seems unnecessary. </p> <p>Although I find recipes calling for cooking in both butter and lard, and Mark Bittman goes for a mixture of butter and extra virgin olive oil, flavourless vegetable oil seems the best choice for keeping it simple. </p> <p>Rick Moonen browns his on the outside, and then cooks them through in the oven, but he works in a restaurant where the ovens are presumably on already. Heating mine up for five minutes seems wasteful when I could just make the crabcakes thinner, and cook them through in the pan. After all, this is a dish you don't want to be waiting around for.</p> <h2>Perfect crab cakes</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395137110\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/21/1345555811732/Felicitys-perfect-crab-ca-008.jpg\" alt=\"Felicity's perfect crab cakes\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Felicity's perfect crab cakes.

  "<p>The worlds of politics and weather are combining as tropical storm Isaac is expected to turn into a hurricane and hit Florida in time for the Republican national convention next week. Let's first talk about Isaac, and then we'll look at the websites where you and I can follow storms for the upcoming season.</p> <p>Right now, Isaac is <a href=\"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT4+shtml/221451.shtml\">140 miles east of Guadeloupe</a>, and could strengthen into a hurricane by Thursday. Hurricane watches are out for the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.</p> <p>The National Hurricane Center's five-day <a href=\"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/refresh/graphics_at4+shtml/170607.shtml?tswind120#contents\">tropical storm wind probabilities</a> page illustrates the where Isaac should be turning next. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395069449\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/8/22/1345665804325/Tropical-storm-Isaac-001.jpg\" alt=\"Tropical storm Isaac\" width=\"460\" height=\"368\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graphic: National Hurricane Center</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: National Hurricane Center</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p></p> <p>The NHC currently puts the probability of tropical storm winds hitting Tampa in the next 5 days at 10% to 20%. That may seem low, but that is about as high as you will get this far out. The probability will go up as confidence in the storm track does.</p> <p>The NHC current forecast track gives reason to believe the probability will go up in Tampa.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395069450\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/8/22/1345666035479/Tropical-storm-Isaac-001.jpg\" alt=\"Tropical storm Isaac\" width=\"460\" height=\"368\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graphic: National Hurricane Center</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: National Hurricane Center</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p></p> <p>As you can see, the NHC believes the most likely path puts Isaac over the Gulf of Mexico south of Naples, Florida at 8am on Monday. Forecast maximum wind speeds are 80mph, good enough for a level 1 hurricane. </p> <p>But let's get into some more details.</p> <p>First, note that there is still a wide range in where Isaac could go. Right now the NHC has a track of anywhere well to the east to well to the west of Florida. The error cone is there because there is a spread in the hurricane models.</p> <p>I won't bore you with all the reasons for these track differences, but it mostly has to do with how the models view <a href=\"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCDAT4+shtml/221449.shtml\">mid-level ridging</a> in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The stronger (weaker) the ridge, an area defined by high pressure, the harder (easier) time the storm, an area of low pressure, will have at strengthening and coming north.</p> <p>Second, the winds <a href=\"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/refresh/graphics_at4+shtml/170607.shtml?table#contents\">are forecast</a> to be fierce, but nothing historic. It is not wise to mess with a hurricane, but 80mph is different from the 125mph with which Katrina hit New Orleans. Indeed, the probability that Isaac is not a hurricane (maximum winds of 74mph or greater) on Monday morning is 70%.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshws.php\">sort of damage</a> one expects from a category 1 \u2013 minor home damage, tree branches down, and power outages \u2013 is not likely something that would postpone a convention for any long stretch of time. Isaac's interactions with islands of the Caribbean combined with its relatively weak standing at the moment is not going to allow for major strengthening.</p> <p>Third, the timing for Isaac is Monday, not later in the week. Hurricanes can meander and the time for Isaac to hit near Tampa is uncertain. Yet, we have a pretty good handle that Monday seems a lot more likely than any other day during the week. In fact, the GFS already has Isaac well past Tampa by 8am on Monday.</p> <p>Hurricane damage such as downed trees and power outages can last until well after the storm has passed. A category 1 hurricane's winds are, however, less likely to have longer lasting effects. Rains can certainly create longer-term flooding problems. At this point, the rain forecasts are pointing towards some flooding, but not biblical-style problems.</p> <p>So what does this all mean for Isaac and the RNC right now?</p> <p>Isaac certainly threatens Florida. The timing of the storm is such that a delay in the start of convention is a possibility. The storm's strength and timing do not at this point suggest that Paul Ryan's nomination as vice-president on Wednesday or Mitt Romney's nomination on Thursday are likely to be interrupted by Isaac.</p> <p>But of course, storm tracks do change. That's why it's important to stay on top of the latest information. To do so, you can visit following websites, which are for pro and rookie alike.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/\">National Hurricane Center</a></h2> <p>This should be the first stop for anyone.

  "<p>My introduction to Indian boozing came on the flight over from Heathrow in June. Having just read the cautionary chapter on women and drinking in my guide book, I was a little surprised when the two 23-year-olds in the neighbouring seats enthusiastically accepted the offer of wine from the flight attendant.</p> <p>Giddy daddy's girls from posh South Delhi, they were on their way home after a year studying for MBAs at a London university. Between gulps from their warm miniatures, they offered increasingly slurred advice on surviving Delhi. Never take public transport and only shop in the air-conditioned malls, said the girl in the window seat. \"You won't know you're not in Bluewater,\" added the other.</p> <p>I fell asleep, only to wake to the sound of retching. Window girl was rubbing her friend's back with one hand and holding back her hair with the other, as the girl in the middle puked noisily into an Air India sickbag.</p> <p>I didn't need to make a mental note not to follow their advice: like every other pretentious foreigner from the gap year rahs to the retired yoga addicts, I had no intention of stepping into a&#xa0;shopping centre. I was going to discover the real&#xa0;India.</p> <p>Within a month, I was lost in an auto rickshaw trying to find <a href=\"http://www.selectcitywalk.com/\" title=\"\">Select Citywalk mall</a> in the south Delhi suburb of Saket. After four weeks of 43C heat and 80% humidity, I'd like to pretend I was craving the air con. But that would be a lie. There were cooling units in all but one room of my house. Really, I was on a booze hunt.</p> <p>Drinking alcohol is perfectly legal in the Indian capital, as it is in most states in the sub-continent. You have to be 25 to drink in Delhi despite talk of lowering the age to 21. It's easy to spot the off-licences, which usually operate as English Wine Shops. \"You guys drink English wine?\" I said to my friend Manvendra when we stopped off en route to a house party during my second weekend in town. \"No one in England even drinks English wine.\" He laughed. \"When we say wine, we generally mean whisky.\" And it's not English \u2013 or indeed Scottish \u2013 but <a href=\"http://theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/apr/15/is-this-the-whisky-revolution\" title=\"\">domestically produced hard liquor</a>, generally distilled from molasses rather than fermented grain.</p> <p>The Wine Shops do tend to sell a&#xa0;few bottles of plonk, made in India&#xa0;and generally covered in dust, warmed to Gl\u00fchwein temperature after festering in the heat. People keep telling me Indian wine is getting better, to which I can only say: what did it used to taste like?</p> <p>So when I invited new friends around to sample a British roast dinner, I decided I was going to serve foreign wine \u2013 not English, but French or Italian; Australian if necessary. But how? The bootlegger all the other correspondents used wasn't answering her phone and my contact at the British High Commission couldn't find what I wanted in the diplomatic enclave's special shop. That's how I found myself in House of Spirits, the upmarket offie at Select Citywalk mall, paying \u00a315 for a bottle of Jacob's Creek.</p> <p>I had already scandalised a local friend by buying the beer. Anita and I were in the back of a taxi when I asked her to tell the driver, in Hindi, to take us to a Wine Shop. She was aghast. \"I just can't,\" she said. \"You'll have to do it in English.\" She refused to come into the shop with me and looked on in horror as I staggered back to the car with a crate of Kingfisher. Indian girls might drink alcohol, but they cannot be seen in public buying it. Same with many Muslims. I had a tour of Old Delhi from a thirtysomething who lamented that he would have been a sommelier had he been born into another religion in another life.</p> <p>So much Indian drinking is done on the sly and&#xa0;off the books. At unlicensed restaurants, beer&#xa0;comes in a teapot or clay beakers, served as \"special tea\". In villages, men get loaded on home-brewed hooch. Officially, just <a href=\"http://www.ias.org.uk/resources/publications/theglobe/globe201102/gl201102_p22.html\" title=\"\">35% of adult men and 5% of women consume alcohol in India</a>. But it's impossible to assess how many people are&#xa0;really getting drunk. According to <a href=\"http://www.indianalcoholpolicy.org/images/alcohol_atlas/F-Current%20Patterns%20and%20Trends.pdf\" title=\"\">research</a> from the Indian Alcohol Policy Alliance, \"undocumented consumption\" accounts for almost 50% of the total.</p> <p>On my way back from the mall, bottles clanking conspicuously, I got out of the first taxi when I realised that the cab smelled of booze not coming from my shopping bags. Despite various government campaigns, drink-driving does not yet carry much stigma here. It's partly to do with the shortcomings of public transport \u2013 the new Delhi metro is great, but the stops are too far apart and all the trains are in the sidings by midnight. Plus, Indians love their cars. They steam into carparks with a glass of whisky on their dashboard, chuck a valet their keys, spend a few hours throwing more booze down their necks and then hop in their jeeps to go home.</p> <p>At first, when offered a lift, I&#xa0;refused to get in. Once or twice I&#xa0;persuaded my friends to get a taxi instead. I'm not proud to say I now accept the ride, telling myself the alternative could be an ill-intentioned tuk-tuk driver who has been glugging moonshine round the corner all night. My shoulders are up to my ears and I hold on to the door handle the whole way home. But I still take the lift.</p>",
  "<p>A group of Tory peers and MPs have come under fire after launching a political group, <a href=\"http://cfor.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Conservative Friends of Russia</a>, in the Russian ambassador's garden this week.</p> <p>The group's website linked to a site accusing the jailed Russian punk band Pussy Riot of \"<a href=\"http://english.pravda.ru/russia/politics/20-08-2012/121929-pussy_riot-0/\" title=\"\">miserable meowing</a>\".</p> <p>About 250 guests including Tory MPs, peers and Russian diplomats attended the event on Tuesday evening at the London residence of Russian envoy Alexander Yakovenko.</p> <p>The event included a barbecue, drinks and a raffle, with prizes of vodka, champagne and a biography of Vladimir Putin.

Denis MacShane, the Labour MP and former Europe minister, said it was inappropriate for the Conservative group to accept hospitality from the Kremlin days after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/17/pussy-riot-sentenced-prison-putin\" title=\"\">a Russian court jailed three members of Pussy Riot on charges of hooliganism</a>.</p> <p>The verdict prompted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/20/madonna-pussy-riot-verdict\" title=\"\">an international outcry</a> and came amid a wider crackdown on dissent following Putin's Kremlin return in May.</p> <p>The launch has also raised questions about close Tory links to Putin's pro-Kremlin United Russia party.</p> <p>The Conservatives sit with United Russia in the Council of Europe, despite a pledge by David Cameron in 2008 that he would pull his MPs out following Russia's invasion of Georgia.</p> <p>There is already an all-parliamentary group on Russia, generally critical of the Kremlin, which recently called on the Foreign Office to impose visa bans on Russian officials guilty of human rights abuses.</p> <p>MacShane said: \"It's an error of judgment at a time of growing disquiet over Russia's abuse of human rights \u2026 Friendship groups with Russia used to be a speciality of the left in the days of communism.</p> <p>\"Now we have Putinism it is the Tory party that is creating a pro-Russian group of fellow travellers. It reflects the shambolic incoherence of Tory networking in Europe and across the world.\"</p> <p>The Conservative Friends of Russia's website links to several news articles from pro-Kremlin website <a href=\"http://www.pravda.ru/\" title=\"\">pravda.ru,</a> led by Vadim Gorshenin, a member of prime minister Dmitry Medvedev's electoral team.</p> <p><a href=\"http://english.pravda.ru/russia/politics/20-08-2012/121929-pussy_riot-0/\" title=\"\">One article is headlined \"The miserable meowing of Pussy Riot\"</a>. The article says the court treated the three women \"gently\", accuses them of \"sexual perversion\" and calls the US president, Barack Obama, a hypocrite. Russia's foreign ministry described western criticism of the trial as \"biased and politically motivated\".</p> <p>Pravda.ru also sponsors <a href=\"http://www.politonline.ru/\" title=\"\">politonline.ru</a>, a website known for its muckraking smears against Russia's opposition. \"To associate the Conservative party with official Putin propaganda on Pussy Riot is outrageous. Putin has now got another committee of useful fools, as Lenin called the leftwing supporters of the Soviet Union,\" MacShane said.</p> <p>Sir Malcolm Rifkind, <a href=\"http://cfor.org.uk/committee/\" title=\"\">the Tory group's honorary president</a>, defended the launch and said it would be ludicrous to cut off contact with Russian officials.</p> <p>He said he had met the Russian ambassador at a small private dinner earlier this year and constructively raised Russia's human rights record, as well as the cases of Alexander Litvinenko and the jailed oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky.</p> <p>\"Friends of Russia is not the same as friends of the Russian government,\" he said. \"It would be silly to boycott everything Russian. Even during the cold war, as a British Foreign Office minister, I had lunch with the Soviet ambassador in his residence. The worse thing is to have no contact.\"</p> <p>Another <a href=\"http://cfor.org.uk/committee/\" title=\"\">committee member</a>, the Tory MP John Whittingdale, said the group was not pro or anti-Putin. Whittingdale, the chairman of the Commons culture select committee, said that he briefly mentioned Pussy Riot during his speech at the launch event and talked to Yakovenko in his garden \"at some length\".</p> <p>Asked who was financing Conservative Friends of Russia, he replied: \"I don't think it's got any money.\" Some Tories, however, expressed disquiet. \"I really don't understand colleagues being so keen to ingratiate themselves with the Putin regime,\" Nigel Fletcher, a former Tory policy adviser, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nigelfletcher\" title=\"\">tweeted.</a></p> <p>David Cameron tried to mend fences with Moscow following the row over the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko. He visited Moscow in September last year where he met Medvedev, then president, and Putin, who was then prime minister. David Miliband has described the prime minister's focus on trade as \"low-grade mercantilism\".</p> <p>The trip, which lasted less than 24 hours, was held in a difficult atmosphere because Putin was uneasy about the Anglo-French campaign against Muammar Gaddafi. This went way beyond the terms of the UN security council resolution, initially supported by Moscow, in Putin's eyes.</p> <p>But the prime minister thought that Putin might be prepared to soften his position on Syria when they met in Downing Street earlier this month shortly before attending an Olympic judo contest. \"They were not as far apart as some people may have thought,\" one government source said.</p> <p>Cameron's courting of Putin, who had not visited London since 2005, was a far cry from the days when he felt free to antagonise Moscow by visiting Georgia in 2008 following Russian military incursions into the former Soviet republic.</p> <p>The Conservative Friends of Russia group was founded three months ago by PR consultant Richard Royal. It was registered at companies house on 13 August. During a speech at this week's event<a href=\"http://cfor.org.uk/resounding-praise-for-sell-out-conservative-friends-of-russia-launch-event/\" title=\"\"> he told guests</a>: \"I believe that Russia is one of the most important, most fascinating, but also most misunderstood countries on this planet.\"</p> <p>Royal added it was \"entirely appropriate\" to accept hospitality from the Russian government for a Russia-related event. He denied any official Kremlin link to the running of the organisation and said costs \"were paid for by myself out of my own pocket\", adding: \"All those involved work on a voluntary basis on the side of full-time jobs.\"</p> <p>Royal said the newsfeed concerning Pussy Riot was \"coincidental\" and \"we don't endorse or agree with anything written independently of us\". He said he would now ask his team to look into finding \"another\" appropriate feed. The pravda.ru article disappeared later on Wednesday, replaced by different links to Russian state media.</p>",
  "<p><strong>(updated below - Update II)</strong></p> <p>Earlier this week, British lawyer and legal correspondent for the New Statesman David Allen Green generated a fair amount of attention by <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/david-allen-green/2012/08/five-legal-myths-about-assange-extradition\">announcing that he would use his objective legal expertise</a> to bust what he called \"legal myths about the Assange extradition.\" These myths, he said, are being irresponsibly spread by Assange defenders and \"are like 'zombie facts' which stagger on even when shot down.\" </p> <p>In addition to his other credentials, Green \u2013 like virtually the entire British press \u2013 is a <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/human-rights/2012/06/desperation-julian-assange\">long-time and deeply devoted Assange-basher</a>, and his purported myth-busting was <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5936600/\">predictably regurgitated</a> by those who reflexively grasp onto anything that reflects poorly on western establishmentarians' public enemy No1. It's really worth examining what Green argued to understand the behavior in which Assange detractors engage to advance this collective vendetta, and also to see how frequently blatant ideological agendas masquerade as high-minded, objective legal expertise.</p> <p>But before getting to that, let us pause to reflect on a truly amazing and revealing fact, one that calls for formal study in several academic fields of discipline. Is it not remarkable that one of the very few individuals over the past decade to risk his welfare, liberty and <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1334341/WikiLeaks-Sarah-Palin-demands-Julian-Assange-hunted-like-Al-Qaeda-terrorist.html\">even</a><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/07/fox-news-bob-beckel-calls_n_793467.html\"> life</a> to meaningfully challenge the secrecy regime on which the American national security state (and those of its <a href=\"http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/03/un-torture-investigator-warns-uk-over.php\">obedient allies</a>) depends just so happens to have become \u2013 long before he sought asylum from Ecuador \u2013 the most intensely and personally despised figure among the American and British media class and the British \"liberal\" intelligentsia? </p> <p>In 2008 \u2013 two years before the release of the \"collateral murder\" video, the Iraq and Afghanistan war logs, and the diplomatic cables \u2013 the Pentagon <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/18/us/18wiki.html\">prepared a secret report</a> which proclaimed WikiLeaks to be an enemy of the state and <a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_MnYI3_FRbbQ/S64J1rmc53I/AAAAAAAACWI/wiLUSVixG5U/s1600/pentagon2.png\">plotted ways to destroy</a> its credibility and reputation. But in a stroke of amazing luck, Pentagon operatives never needed to do any of that, because the establishment media in the US and Britain harbor at least as much intense personal loathing for the group's founder as the US government does, and eagerly took the lead in targeting him. Many people like to posit the US national security state and western media outlets as adversarial forces, but here \u2013 as is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/26/international/middleeast/26FTE_NOTE.html?pagewanted=all\">so often the case</a> \u2013 they have so harmoniously joined in common cause.</p> <p>Whatever else is true, establishment media outlets show unlimited personal animus toward the person who, as a panel of judges <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jun/02/julian-assange-martha-gelhorn-prize\">put it</a> when they awarded him the the 2011 Martha Gellhorn prize for journalism, \"has given the public more scoops than most journalists can imagine.\" Similarly, when the Australian version of the Pulitzers \u2013 the Walkley Foundation \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.walkleys.com/news/5131/\">awarded its highest distinction</a> (for \"Most Outstanding Contribution to Journalism\") to WikiLeaks in 2011, it <a href=\"http://www.walkleys.com/2011winners#most-outstanding-contribution-to-journalism\">cited</a> the group's \"courageous and controversial commitment to the finest traditions of journalism: justice through transparency,\" and observed: \"So many eagerly took advantage of the secret cables to create <em>more scoops in a year than most journalists could imagine in a lifetime</em>.\"</p> <p>When it comes to the American media, I've <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/11/30/wikileaks_10/\">long noted</a> this revealing paradox. The person who (along with whomever is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/14/bradley-manning-deserves-a-medal\">the heroic leaker</a>) enabled \"more scoops in a year than most journalists could imagine in a lifetime\" \u2013 and who was quickly branded an enemy by the Pentagon and a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/19/joe-biden-wikileaks-assange-high-tech-terrorist_n_798838.html\">terrorist by high U.S. officials</a> \u2013 is the most hated figure among establishment journalists, even though they are ostensibly devoted to precisely these values of transparency and exposing serious government wrongdoing. (This transparency was imposed not only <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/12/24/wikileaks_23/\">on the US and its allies</a>, but also some of the <a href=\"http://ggdrafts.blogspot.com.br/2011/10/bill-keller-on-wikileaks-cables.html\">most oppressive regimes in the Arab world</a>). </p> <p>But the contempt is far more intense, and bizarrely personal, from the British press, much of which behaves with staggering levels of mutually-reinforcing vindictiveness and groupthink when it's time to scorn an outsider like Assange. On Tuesday, Guardian columnist Seumas Milne wrote <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/21/why-us-is-out-to-get-assange\">a superb analysis</a> of British media coverage of Assange, and observed that \"the virulence of British media hostility towards the WikiLeaks founder is now unrelenting.\" Milne noted that to the British press, Assange \"is nothing but a 'monstrous narcissist', a bail-jumping 'sex pest' and an exhibitionist maniac\" \u2013 venom spewed at someone \"who has yet to be charged, let alone convicted, of anything.\"</p> <p>Indeed, the personalized nature of this contempt from self-styled sober journalists often borders on the creepy (when it's not wildly transgressing that border). Former New York Times' executive editor Bill Keller infamously quoted an email from a Times reporter <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/30/magazine/30Wikileaks-t.html?pagewanted=all\">claiming</a> that Assange wore \"filthy white socks that collapsed around his ankles\" and \"smelled as if he hadn't bathed in days.\" On the very same day WikiLeaks released over 400,000 classified documents showing genuinely horrific facts about massive civilian deaths in the Iraq war and US complicity in torture by Iraqi forces, the New York Times front-paged <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/24/world/24assange.html?hp\">an article</a> purporting to diagnose Assange with a variety of psychological afflictions and concealed, malicious motives, based on its own pop-psychology observations and those of Assange's enemies (\"erratic and imperious behavior\", \"a nearly delusional grandeur\", \"he is not in his right mind\", \"pursuing a vendetta against the United States\").</p> <p>A columnist for the Independent, Joan Smith, recently watched Assange's interview of Ecuadorean president Rafeal Correa and <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/joan-smith/joan-smith-why-do-we-buy-julian-assanges-oneman-psychodrama-7869897.html\">offered up this wisdom</a>: \"He's put on weight, his face is puffy and he didn't bother to shave before his interview with Correa.\" And perhaps most psychologically twisted of all: a team of New York Times reporters and editors last week, in its lead article about Ecuador's decision to grant asylum, decided it would be appropriate to <a href=\"http://gregmitchellwriter.blogspot.com.br/2012/08/nyt-flushes-assange-charges.html\">include a quote</a> from one of Assange's most dedicated enemies claiming that when the WikiLeaks founder was a visitor in his apartment, he \"refused to flush the toilet during his entire stay\" (faced with a barrage of mockery and disgust over their reporting on Assange's alleged toilet habits, the NYT sheepishly deleted that passage without comment).</p> <p>It is difficult to think of anyone this side of Saddam Hussein who triggers this level of personalized, deeply ingrained hatred from establishment journalists. Few who spew this vitriol would dare speak with the type of personalized scorn toward, say, George Bush or Tony Blair \u2013 who actually launched an aggressive war that resulted in the deaths of at least 100,000 innocent people and kidnapped people from around the globe with no due process and sent them to be tortured. The reaction Assange inspires among establishment media figures is really sui generis.</p> <p>It is vital to note, as was just demonstrated, that this media contempt long pre-dates, and exists wholly independent of, the controversy surrounding the sex assault allegations in Sweden, and certainly long pre-dates his seeking of asylum from Ecuador. Indeed, given that he has not been convicted of anything, to assume Assange's guilt would be reprehensible \u2013 every bit as reprehensible as concluding that the allegations are a CIA ruse or that the complainants' allegations should be dismissed as frivolous or inherently untrustworthy. </p> <p>It would be genuinely nice to think that the same British government that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jan/13/pinochet.chile6\">refused to extradite</a> the <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/victims-of-pinochets-police-prepare-to-reveal-details-of-rape-and-torture-1183793.html\">mass rapist</a> Augusto Pinochet has suddenly developed a devoted passion for ensuring that alleged sex assault offenders are brought to justice \u2013 just as it would be nice to believe that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/21/human-rights-critics-russia-ecuador\">sudden interest</a> in denouncing Ecuador's press freedom record was driven by some newly discovered and authentic concern in the west for civil liberties protections in South America. But as Milne put it last night with great understatement: \"such posturing looks increasingly specious.\" As he rhetorically asked:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Can anyone seriously believe the dispute would have gone global, or that the British government would have made its asinine threat to suspend the Ecuadorean embassy's diplomatic status and enter it by force, or that scores of police would have surrounded the building, swarming up and down the fire escape and guarding every window, if it was all about one man wanted for questioning over sex crime allegations in Stockholm?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Like those who suddenly discover the imperatives of feminism when it comes time to justify the war in Afghanistan, or those who become overnight advocates of gay rights when it comes time to demonize the regime in Tehran, or those who took a very recent interest in Ecuadorean press freedoms, these sex assault allegations -- as serious and deserving of legal resolution as they are -- are being cynically exploited as a political weapon by many who have long despised Assange for reasons entirely independent of this case.</p> <p>* * * * * </p> <p>There are several obvious reasons why Assange provokes such unhinged media contempt. The most obvious among them is competition: the resentment generated by watching someone outside their profession generate more critical scoops in a year than all other media outlets combined (see <a href=\"http://www.tinyrevolution.com/mt/archives/001990.html\">this brilliant 2008 post</a>, in the context of the Clintons, about how professional and ego-based competition produces personal hatred like nothing else can).</p> <p>Other causes are more subtle though substantive. Many journalists (and liberals) like to wear the costume of outsider-insurgent, but are, at their core, devoted institutionalists, faithful believers in the goodness of their society's power centers, and thus resent those (like Assange) who actually and deliberately place themselves outside of it. By putting his own liberty and security at risk to oppose the world's most powerful factions, Assange has clearly demonstrated what happens to real adversarial dissidents and insurgents \u2013 they're persecuted, demonized, and threatened, not befriended by and invited to parties within the halls of imperial power \u2013 and he thus causes many journalists to stand revealed as posers, servants to power, and courtiers.</p> <p>Then there's the ideological cause. As one long-time British journalist told me this week when discussing the vitriol of the British press toward Assange: \"Nothing delights British former lefties more than an opportunity to defend power while pretending it is a brave stance in defence of a left liberal principle.\" That's the warped mindset that led to so many of these self-styled liberal journalists <a href=\"http://eustonmanifesto.org/the-euston-manifesto/\">to support the attack on Iraq</a> and other acts of Western aggression in the name of liberal values. And it's why nothing triggers their rage like fundamental critiques of, and especially meaningful opposition to, the institutions of power to which they are unfailingly loyal.</p> <p>* * * * * </p> <p>With that context established, let us return to David Allen Green. The attacks on those who have defended Assange's extradition and asylum arguments has depended on the disgusting slander that such advocates are indifferent to the allegations of sexual assault made against him or, worse, are \"rape apologists.\" </p> <p>The reality is exactly the opposite. I have spoken to countless Assange defenders over the last couple of years and not a single one \u2013 literally not one \u2013 is dismissive of the need for those allegations in Sweden to be taken seriously and to be legally and fairly resolved. Typifying this view is Milne's column last night, which in the midst of scorning the attacks on Assange, embraced \"the seriousness of the rape allegations made against Assange, for which he should clearly answer and, if charges are brought, stand trial.\" </p> <p>That is the view of every Assange defender with a platform that I know of, including me (one can certainly find anonymous internet commenters, or the occasional named one, making actual, horrific rape apologist claims, but one can find stray advocates saying anything; imputing those views to Assange defenders generally would be like claiming that all Assange critics want to see him illegally shot in the head or encaged for life because <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1334341/WikiLeaks-Sarah-Palin-demands-Julian-Assange-hunted-like-Al-Qaeda-terrorist.html\">some prominent American</a> and <a href=\"http://www.peopleokwithmurderingassange.com/the_list.html\">other commentators</a> have <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRMV7zi4h_k\">called for this</a>).</p> <p>Not only Assange defenders, but also his own lawyers and the Ecuadorean government, have worked relentlessly to ensure that <em>he faces those allegations in Sweden</em>. They have merely sought to do so in a way that protects him from extradition to the US to face espionage charges for his journalism \u2013 a threat that could send him to prison for life (likely in a torturous super-max facility), and a threat only the wilfuly blind could deny is <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/29/AR2010112905973.html\">serious and real</a>. </p> <p>In their <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/21/opinion/wikileaks-and-the-global-future-of-free-speech.html?ref=opinion\">New York Times op-ed this week</a>, Michael Moore and Oliver Stone correctly argue that it is \"the British and Swedish governments that stand in the way of [the sex assault] investigation, not Mr Assange.\" That's because, they note, Assange has repeatedly offered to be questioned by Swedish authorities in London, or to travel <em>today</em> to Sweden to face those allegations if he could be assured that his doing so would not result in his extradition to the US to face espionage charges. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/21/rafael-correa-britain-julian-assange_n_1820515.html\">Time and again</a>, \"Correa said Ecuador never intended to stop Assange from facing justice in Sweden. 'What we've asked for is guarantees that he won't be extradited to a third country,' he said.\" Both <em>Britain and Sweden have steadfastly refused even to discuss any agreement that could safeguard both the rights of the complainants and Assange's rights not to be imprisoned for basic journalism.</em></p> <p>These facts \u2013 and they are facts \u2013 pose a lethal threat to the key false narrative that Assange and his defenders are motivated by a desire to evade his facing the sex assault allegations in Sweden. So these facts need to be impugned, and that's where David Allen Green and his \"myth-busting\" legal expertise comes into play.</p> <p>One myth Green purports to debunk is the notion that \"the Swedes should interview Assange in London.\" This cannot be, Green argues, because \"Assange is not wanted merely for questioning. He is wanted for arrest.\" He also echoes numerous other Assange critics by arguing that the \"he-has-not-yet-been-charged\" claim is a mere technical irrelevancy: the only reason this is true, he says, is because he must be in Sweden for that to happen.</p> <p>But back in early 2011, Assange critics were telling a much different story. Back then, they were arguing that Assange was wildly overstating the danger he faced from extradition to Sweden because the investigation there was at such a preliminary stage and he was merely wanted for questioning. Indeed, here's what the very same David Allen Green <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/david-allen-green/2011/02/assange-eaw-sexual-sweden\">wrote on 28 February 2011</a> when explaining the status of the investigation to his readers [my emphasis]:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"This extradition order does not necessarily mean, of course, that he will be extradited, <em>still less that he will be charged</em>, tried, or convicted. Assange may win an appeal of the extradition order, or Sweden may decide either not to continue or to <em>interview him while he remains in England</em>. However, unless some such external event intervenes, Assange will be shortly extradited to Sweden <em>to be questioned</em> about an allegation of rape, two allegations of sexual molestation, and an allegation of unlawful coercion.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Back when it suited Green, he emphasized that Assange has not been charged with any crime, that there is far from any certainty that he would be, and that extradition to Sweden is merely for him \"to be questioned\" on these allegations: exactly the \"myths\" and \"zombie facts\" which he now purports to bust. Moreover, Swedish law professor Marten Schultz, who strongly supports Assange's extradition to Sweden, has <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/justice-for-sweden\">said the same</a> [my emphasis]:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The UK supreme court's decision means <em>only that Assange will be transferred to Sweden for interrogation. </em>It does not mean that he will be tried, or <em>even charged</em>. It is entirely possible that he will be transferred to Sweden, questioned, and released if the Swedish authorities find that there are insufficient grounds for prosecution. It is impossible \u2013 as it should be \u2013 to predict how the case will unfold.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Clearly, as Green himself used to acknowledge, Assange at this point is wanted for questioning in this case, and has not been charged. Once he's questioned, he might be charged, or the case might be dropped. That is what has made the Swedes' steadfast refusal to question him in England so mystifying, of such concern to Assange, and is the real reason that the investigation has thus far been obstructed. Indeed, Swedish legal expert Ove Bring has <a href=\"https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&amp;artikel=5235707\">made clear</a>, in the context of discussing Assange, that \"under Swedish law it is possible to interrogate people abroad,\" but that Sweden is refusing to do so simply for reasons of \"prestige\" (he added: \"If he goes to Sweden, is interrogated, then I expect the case would be dropped, as <em>the evidence is not enough to charge him with a crime</em>\").</p> <p>Then there's the very strange argument Green makes about why extradition to the US would be more easily accomplished if he's in Britain rather than Sweden. I've <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/20/julian-assange-right-asylum\">previously set out</a> the reasons and supporting evidence showing the reverse is true and won't repeat those here, but let's look at what Green says to support his claim:</p> <blockquote> <p>One can add that there is no evidence whatsoever that the United Kingdom would not swiftly comply with any extradition request from the United States; quite the reverse. Ask Gary McKinnon, or Richard O'Dwyer, or the NatWest Three.</p> </blockquote> <p>The US has been seeking McKinnon's extradition from Britain for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/24/gary-mckinnon-extradition-review-hacker\">a full seven years and counting</a>; O'Dwyer also remains in England and is the subject of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/06/richard-odwyer-extradition-opposed-majority\">popular campaign to block his shipment to the U.S.</a>; the NatWest Three were able to<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/5160094.stm\"> resist extradition to the US for four full years</a>. These cases disprove, rather than prove, that an extradition demand from the US would be \"swiftly complied with\" in Britain. In contrast to the secretive Swedish judicial system, there is substantial public debate along with transparent (and protracted) judicial proceedings in Britain over extradition.</p> <p>It is true, as Green notes, that the Swedish government cannot provide an iron-clad \"guarantee\" that Assange would not be extradited to the US. That's because it is Swedish courts, and not the government, that make the ultimate decision on extradition. But both the British and Swedish governments play an important role in any extradition proceeding: they take influential positions on whether extradition is legally warranted. Under Britain's extradition treaty, it must consent to the subsequent extradition of any individual it extradites (meaning its consent would be needed for Sweden to send Assange to the U.S.), while in Sweden, the government <a href=\"http://www.firmmagazine.com/features/1179/Assange_-_what%27s_going_on%3F.html\">must formally opine</a> on whether extradition should take place (some Swedes have<a href=\"http://ibnkafkasobiterdicta.wordpress.com/2012/08/19/the-julian-assange-circus-why-is-carl-bildt-lying/\"> made the case</a> that the government's position would be dispositive).</p> <p>At the very least, there is ample room for negotiation. Both the British and Swedish governments could \u2013 and should \u2013 take the position that to prosecute Assange under espionage statutes for acts of journalism would be political crimes that are not subject to their extradition treaties with the U.S. or are otherwise not cognizable extradition offenses. Rather than explore any of those possible grounds for agreement, both governments have simply refused to negotiate either with Assange's lawyers or the Ecuadorean government over any proposals to safeguard his rights. That refusal on the part of those governments \u2013 and not any desire to obstruct the investigation or evade facing those allegations \u2013 is what led the Ecuadoreans to conclude that asylum was necessary to protect Assange from political persecution.</p> <p>The complainants in Sweden have the absolute right to have their serious allegations against Assange investigated and legally resolved. But Assange has the equally compelling right under international law and treaties to be free of political persecution: which is exactly what prosecuting him (and perhaps imprisoning him for life) in the US for WikiLeaks' disclosures would be. </p> <p>It is vital that both sets of rights be safeguarded, not just one. The only just solution is one that protects both. Assange's lawyers and the Ecuadorians have repeatedly pursued arrangements to vindicate all substantial rights at stake so that he can travel to Sweden \u2013 today \u2013 to face those allegations while being protected against unjust extradition to the US. It is the refusal of the British and Swedish authorities even to consider any such proposals that have brought this situation to the unfortunate standstill it is in.</p> <p>It is incredibly telling that media attacks on Assange do not even pay lip service to, let alone evince any actual interest in, the profound threats to press freedom that would come if he were extradited to and tried in the United States. In lieu of being informed about any of this, readers and viewers are bombarded with disturbing, and often quite disturbed, rants driven by unrestrained personal contempt. That contempt not only drowns out every important value at stake in this case, but also any regard for the basic facts.</p> <p>* * * </p> <p><strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong>: Numerous people objected that I too readily conceded the point that Swedish courts, rather than the Swedish government, are the ultimate decision-makers on extradition requests, and the Swedish government therefore cannot provide Assange with a guarantee that he will not be extradited to the U.S. <a href=\"http://ibnkafkasobiterdicta.wordpress.com/2012/08/19/the-julian-assange-circus-why-is-carl-bildt-lying/\">This article</a> by a lawyer -- who fervently believes that Assange should be extradited to Sweden -- makes the case very compellingly that the Swedish government most certainly can provide such a guarantee if it chose to [my emphasis]:</p> <blockquote> <p>Extradition procedures are typically of a mixed nature, where courts and governments share the final decision \u2013 it is not unknown for <em>governments to reject an extradition request in spite of court verdict allowing it</em>. . . . </p> <p>Article 12 [of Sweden's extradition law] adds that the government may put conditions on its decision to accept an extradition request. <em>The deciding body is thus the government</em>, with an input by the Prosecutor general and a veto right given to the Supreme Court in case where the requested person doesn't accept to be extradited.</p> </blockquote> <p>The article goes on to cite the Swedish extradition law to outline two possible outcomes where the target of an extradition request challenges its validity: (1) the Swedish supreme court rules that extradition is not legally permissible, in which case the Swedish government is not free to extradite; (2) the Swedish supreme court rules that extradition is legally permissible, in which case the Swedish government is free to decide that it will not extradite for policy or other prudential reasons. In other words, the Swedish judiciary has the right to <em>block</em> an extradition request on legal grounds, but it lacks the power to<em> compel</em> extradition; if the courts approve of the legal basis, the Swedish government still retains the authority to decide if extradition should take place.</p> <p>As indicated, even if it were true that Swedish government was an unable to offer Assange a so-called \"iron-clad guarantee\" against extradition, there is still grounds to negotiate in order to have him travel to Sweden to face these allegations; given that the Swedish government clearly has, at the very least, a significant role to play in the process, its advanced position against Assange's extradition to the U.S. on the basis of WikiLeaks' journalistic disclosures would be significant. But there is at least a strong argument to make, if not an irrefutable one, that the Swedish government is able to offer precisely the guarantee that both Assange and Ecuadorean authorities have sought in order to enable him immediately to travel to Sweden to face the sex assault allegations against him. Independently, the British government is also clearly in a position to contribute to those assurances, given the need for its consent if extradition to the U.S. from Sweden is to take place. </p> <p>If one wants to find a culprit for why these sex assault allegations are not being resolved the way they should be, the refusal of these two governments even to negotiate to secure Assange's clear rights against unjust extradition is the place to begin.</p> <p>* * * </p> <p><strong><em>UPDATE II</em></strong>: For even more compelling evidence that the Swedish government is the final decision-maker in extradition matters and does indeed have the power to guarantee Assange that he would not be extradited to the U.S. based on his journalism, see the citations in Point 3 of <a href=\"http://pastehtml.com/view/c91yw7wjy.html\">this excellent reply to Green</a>.</p>",

  "<p>A philosophy graduate and would-be novelist who wrote a tortured story about a young man who murdered a Nigerian prostitute in Turin has been arrested on suspicion of carrying out an almost identical killing in real life.</p> <p>Daniele Ughetto Piampaschet, 34, has denied murdering Anthonia Egbuna, 20, and dumping her body in the river Po in November 2011, even though details of her death are eerily echoed by his typed manuscript entitled The Rose and the Lion, in which the protagonist kills a Nigerian prostitute rather than share her with other men, believing it \"the only way to preserve her purity intact.\"</p> <p>In a case reminiscent of the 1992 film Basic Instinct, police found the nine-page manuscript among Egbuna's possessions and traced it back to Piampaschet, a regular customer who had become obsessively jealous of her, investigators believe.</p> <p>In letters found alongside the manuscript, Piampaschet wrote to Egbuna: \"I love you but I am tired of your work ... When will you leave the streets? Please, leave them, we can earn money differently.\"</p> <p>In his story, the prostitute, who is also called Anthonia, and the protagonist, a young man who lives in the same area as Piampaschet, spend \"carefree hours\" together, but the man loses sleep dreaming of her other customers, \"each one dirtier and more lurid than the next.\"</p> <p>One night he arrives to pick her up, they argue and she refuses to get into his car. Enraged, the man forces her to climb in and then strangles her behind a bush on the same street in Turin where the real-life Anthonia worked.</p> <p>Piampaschet, who was formerly married to another Nigerian woman, was living with his parents and unemployed at the time of the murder. This summer he travelled to London to work as a volunteer at the Olympics.</p> <p>Using mobile-phone records, police discovered he called Egbuna 1,900 times last year. The last call was on 28 November, the date police believe he killed Egbuna, whose body was recovered from the Po in February.</p> <p>In contrast to Piampaschet's story, she had been stabbed 20 times, not strangled.</p> <p>Investigators believe that Egbuna was sending regular sums of money back to relatives in Nigeria and had no intention of giving up her work. Piampaschet may have written his story to flesh out his fledgling plans for murder or as a warning to Egbuna.</p> <p>Piampaschet's fictional protagonist is unable to face life after killing Anthonia and commits suicide. The real life Piampaschet is instead in jail, where he has claimed that the similarities between his manuscript and the murder are coincidence. \"I have written about the lives of other Nigerian prostitutes and nothing happened to them,\" he told investigators.</p> <p>In Basic Instinct, Sharon Stone's character describes an ice-pick murder in a novel which is then committed in real life, making her the prime suspect.</p> <p>If convicted, Piampaschet will not be the first writer caught out describing a murder he committed. Krystian Bala, a Polish novelist, was sentenced to 25 years in 2007 for murdering a businessman seven years earlier after police investigating him spotted parallels between the murder and Bala's 2003 novel, Amok.</p>",
  "<p>Building shopping centres is fraught with difficulties. Just ask the people of Bradford. Their city centre is blighted by a large building site, dubbed the Bradford Hole, where work on a new Westfield shopping centre was halted four years ago. Occupy Westfield protesters recently set up camp there for five weeks but have left again.</p> <p>In nearby Leeds, however, it's a different story. A new shopping centre the size of 13 football pitches and crowned by a sweeping glass dome is due to open there next year, the largest project of its kind in western Europe. Trinity Leeds will have a million square feet of space with 120 shops, 12 restaurants, bars and cafes and the biggest Everyman cinema in Britain. As if that were not enough, work is due to start on another huge city-centre mall in 2014.</p> <p>The company behind the \u00a3350m Trinity Leeds project, Land Securities \u2013 Britain's largest property developer \u2013 has taken a big gamble. It already owns the White Rose mall outside Leeds, which is its most valuable retail asset. But despite the recession, the company reckons Leeds is hungry for new shops.</p> <p>Trinity Leeds, named after the nearby 18th century Holy Trinity Church, could easily have fallen victim to the financial crisis. But after being put on ice for 15 months it is now due to open in March.</p> <p>\"We weren't going to leave a big sandpit in the city centre,\" said Gerald Jennings, Land Securities' portfolio director for the north and Scotland. He describes the project as a game changer for the city, which will have a ripple effect on other businesses. \"We're the first to commit to a large-scale scheme in Leeds and we've been here for a long time. City centre schemes are tough to put together. You've got to buy up a lot of interest. There are only a few people who can do this. You do need that financial strength behind you.\"</p> <p>Back in Bradford, Westfield insists its mall is back on track with a revised, slightly smaller scheme. The Australian developer recently signed up Marks &amp; Spencer and Next as anchor tenants in addition to Debenhams, but will not restart construction until it has pre-let more space to other retailers.</p> <p>Despite the problems in Bradford, Hammerson \u2013 one of Land Securities' biggest rivals \u2013 also believes it has the financial strength to make a new scheme work in Leeds. The company, which owns shopping centres around the country including Brent Cross in London and the Bullring in Birmingham, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/23/hammerson-shopping-centres?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">hopes to start construction of a \u00a3120m, 400,000 sq ft mall called Eastgate Quarters in 2014</a>. It originally envisaged a \u00a3650m mall of the same size as Trinity Leeds, and the size of a second project phase will depend on market conditions.</p> <p>Its two shopping streets will be modelled on the nearby Victoria Arcade, home to luxury retailers including Harvey Nichols and Louis Vuitton. Leeds is renowned for its old shopping areas, with the city's Cross Arcade providing a home for Michael Marks's famous penny bazaar when it moved from the outdoor market in 1894. Hammerson is now trying to buy Victoria Arcade to gain a \"front door\" for its project, which was put on hold in late 2008. Rents look promising. Earlier this year L'Occitane paid \u00a3270 a square foot - a rate not seen in Leeds since 2007.</p> <p>In another important step, Hammerson recently secured John Lewis as an anchor tenant for Eastgate Quarters and is close to agreeing a pre-let. Land Securities had been talking to the department store as well, and was disappointed not to be able to accommodate it at Trinity Leeds.</p> <p>Both companies, however, believe their malls will be able to exist side by side, with Eastgate Quarter targeting luxury brands and Trinity Leeds traditional high street retailers including Mango, Hollister and Cult.</p> <p>Trinity Leeds has eight entrances and is surrounded by Leeds's three busiest shopping streets, as well as being close to the train station, one of Britain's busiest rail terminals. The mall has shops on three levels and is topped off with a glass dome which fans out from the ground and leaves the centre open at the sides to give it an airy feel, less like an enclosed mall.</p> <p>Another draw will be a new 13,000-seat music venue, Leeds Arena, which is due to open its doors by early summer next year.</p> <p>Trinity Leeds will create 3,500 retail jobs \u2013 about the same number as at its out-of-town White Rose mall \u2013 and up to 1,000 temporary construction jobs with 50 apprentices also being trained on site.</p> <p>The centre will be the only major mall to open in the UK in 2013, while the projected completion of 355,000 square feet of shopping centre space across the country this year is the lowest annual figure since the early 1960s.</p> <p>Some 80% of the shop space at Trinity Leeds has already been let to retailers led by Marks &amp; Spencer, Primark and Next. Shop rents are expected to range from \u00a3250 to \u00a3300 a square foot. With the city ranked the fourth biggest shopping destination in Britain in terms of spending \u2013 behind London's West End, Glasgow and Birmingham \u2013 Land Securities and analysts are confident that it will be a success.</p> <p>Land Securities also wants to expand White Rose, which opened in 1997. Some retailers, including New Look, Primark and the shoe shop Office, are taking space both at White Rose and its larger sister in the town centre. Harm Meijer, an analyst at JP Morgan Cazenove, thinks Land Securities will do fine in Leeds and that the city will become one of its biggest development profit drivers. \"Leeds is getting busy indeed, but I would be more worried for those who may get squeezed,\" he said.</p> <p>Shopping centres are desperately trying to keep up with changing customer habits and tastes. Land Securities provides free Wi-Fi at all its malls, and large digital interactive screens with music, information and games will be dotted around Trinity Leeds. Retailers will also do their bit. New Look will have iPads for the public to use at its store.</p> <p>The old rule of thumb was that restaurants, bars and cafes made up 10% to 12% of shopping centres, but that figure has risen to 20%. \"Modern schemes have to have more leisure,\" said Land Securities' chief spokesman, Donal McCabe. \"People are going [to malls] less often but are staying longer. You can't eat out on the internet. Even in the downturn, the leisure spend has held up better than the retail spend.\"</p>",
  "<p>A gimlet eye <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/kebab-shop-in-lewisham-beats-the-ritz-for-customer-satisfaction-on-tripadvisor-8069063.html\" title=\"\">recently spotted</a> that a little Turkish restaurant is currently the seventh-best rated in London on the website TripAdvisor, beating more than 10,000 others. It's not, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2191616/Meze-Mengal-Restaurant-guide-ranks-kebab-shop-best-restaurants-London.html?ito=feeds-newsxml\" title=\"\">as some have giddily said</a>, strictly a kebab shop, and it's worth noting straight away that TripAdvisor is an imperfect source of information on restaurants. Most of its contributors seem to be tourists, and visitors in a new city are by definition inexpert local restaurant critics.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Meze Mangal in the south-eastern borough of Lewisham is a loveably dowdy restaurant which has been knocking out superb grilled meats and pide (a Turkish pizza variant) for more than 12 years. And it's great to see kebabs featuring so highly on such a list. Turkish food has long been the most underrated in the UK, and its greatest offering perhaps the most bastardised and maligned of all our imported foods.</p> <p>A good kebab marries the comforting solidity of its bread and the crunch of its salad to the nourishing, tender spice of its meat. It resembles in no way the standard dismal offering of the British high street: a cardboard pocket of dough, brown and wizened lettuce, a greasy spurt of sauce, the textureless brown of processed flesh.</p> <p>I have a <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/features/prima-doners-the-kebab-gets-a-culinary-makeover-7827835.html\" title=\"\">small mobile kebab venture of my own</a> \u2013 currently on hiatus \u2013 and I've studied the history and manifestations of the food in some detail, both here and in Turkey. The ugly city of Gaziantep by the Syrian border produces the most ravishing ones: the lamb there \u2013 lamb, mutton and goat are the best meats \u2013 is marinated for several days in a fierce and pungent mix of spices, the floppy breads are warm and chewy, the saucing is judicious and rich. People take them seriously well beyond the Caucasus and south into Persia and the Middle East, but Turkey is the true home of the kebab. \"Doner\" means \"to turn\" in Turkish: a gently revolving, well-assembled spit of unminced meat is one of the most beautiful shop windows I can think of.</p> <p>The London Turkish community has quietly been making good kebabs for generations, but often it seemed that most customers came from within the community already. The average British kebab experience, and the nation's views on kebabs in general, were rather less salubrious. There are signs the dish has lately been enjoying something of a renaissance. E Mono <a href=\"http://www.kentishtowner.co.uk/2012/01/03/this-years-rising-star-why-e-mono-of-course-who-are-now-planning-a-restaurant-downstairs/\" title=\"\">opened in Kentish Town last year</a>, selling free-range chicken and unfrozen lamb, and received a gushing paean from the Times's critic. One of the shticks there is to lay a whole pickled chilli down the length of each kebab. Another favourite is the Syrian restaurant Abu Zaad in Shepherd's Bush; a Leeds joint called Zulfi's <a href=\"http://www.metro.co.uk/home/842673-leeds-has-best-doner-kebab-shop-in-the-land\" title=\"\">was named best in the UK</a> a couple of years ago. (The competition was sponsored by laddish alcopop WKD, so make of that what you will.)</p> <p>I believe that after the vast and welcome improvements made to burgers, pizza and most recently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/aug/21/chooks-away-fried-chicken-goes-gourmet\" title=\"\">to fried chicken</a>, the kebab is next for full-scale rehabilitation. People will have mixed feelings about this, and it's easy to mock the neophiliac faddiness of the food scene, its tendency to gush praise on to the fleetingly trendy \u2013 just look at the hipster hordes frequenting the Turkish restaurants on the Kingsland Road in Dalston, east London. But since a good kebab is such a genuine delight, and since the standard of the average product could scarcely be lower, whatever gains or enhancements can be made to it should be welcomed.</p> <p>If one believes TripAdvisor, and this trend has started in an unassuming premises in an unassuming borough, so much the better.</p>",
  "<p>Summer is a time for beaches and relaxation \u2013 and, historically, for all sorts of destructive crises. Time and again, it has proven dangerous for the world to be on holiday.</p> <p>August is an especially bad month for financial markets. On 15 August 1971, Richard Nixon ended the US commitment to a fixed gold price, and since then the world has lived with currency volatility and instability. On 13 August 1982 (a Friday), the Mexican finance minister Silva Herzog went to Washington to tell the International Monetary Fund and the US government that Mexico would be unable to make its scheduled debt payment the following Monday. On 17 August 1998, the Russian prime minister Sergei Kiriyenko announced that his country would simultaneously default and devalue. And in the first week of August 2007, IKB Deutsche Industriebank disintegrated, as the US subprime crisis spread.</p> <p>The roots of this seasonal nature of crises predate the first world war, and lie in the era of the classic gold standard. The explanation at that time was usually found in the predictable timing of the international payments mechanism. In the late summer, farmers in the western hemisphere brought their crops to traders for export and demanded cash payment, which the traders needed to raise from their banks. The consequence was a demand for gold in the US and mounting exchange rate pressure on Britain and other European importers.</p> <p>The same pattern of selling pressure on sterling was repeated in the interwar era. Finally, in September 1931, Britain left the restored gold standard, which led to the collapse of the system as a whole.</p> <p>Europe's central bankers had been nervous, even superstitious, about the late summer long before 1931. Montagu Norman, the longest-serving governor of the Bank of England and a romantic and temperamental man, regularly left his office for several weeks at this time of year - the result of nervous exhaustion. He was literally at sea, crossing the Atlantic, when the gold standard broke down; Bank staff advised him with a cryptic cabled message: \"Old lady goes off.\"</p> <p>It is hard to imagine the harvest-driven seasonal cycle of payments producing crises today, but somehow the problem persists. One explanation could be that trading is often thinner during the holiday season, so any disturbance inevitably has a bigger impact.</p> <p>But the technical side of crises masks a much more dramatic story. How summers and crises go together was obvious in the event that triggered the first big collapse of the gold standard, the outbreak of the first world war in 1914. This was the <em>urkrise</em> \u2013 the event that made the 20th century so terrible.</p> <p>Crises are in part about gamesmanship, about taking the other side by surprise. A country poised to embark on some radical and uncharted course of action often believes that holidays produce additional scope for delaying or frustrating the other side's countermove.</p> <p>The logic of a summer provocation was abundantly clear in 1914. Austrian archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated in Sarajevo on 28 June, but the subsequent diplomatic discussions dragged out for weeks. Germany's top officials ostensibly went on holiday in order to create the impression that the tensions could easily be resolved.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Germans waited for the French president and prime minister, who had both been visiting their ally Russia, to leave St Petersburg - at which point they rapidly pressed Austria to deliver an ultimatum that they knew the Russians could not accept. The news would arrive while the French leaders were at sea, and so would find it more difficult to produce an effective and coordinated response.</p> <p>Holiday logic was also used to maximise bargaining power in recent cases of default or threatened default. Mexico's action in August 1982 took officials elsewhere completely by surprise. In the US, the treasury secretary Donald Regan was playing golf with Ronald Reagan, while European central bankers were on holiday and hard to reach in the pre-mobile phone era. A predictable funding problem was left unresolved until the moment creditors would be least likely to present a united front, and most likely to give in to pressure to undertake crisis management measures.</p> <p>In August 1998, Russia had only just concluded a huge IMF programme that appeared to stabilise the country. The arrangement provided enough funds for insiders to exchange their roubles for foreign assets. Once the insiders had saved their own positions, they no longer saw any need to maintain the exchange rate. The IMF was in summer mode, and all of the consultations required complicated conference calls from remote locations.</p> <p>When a compromise package is agreed that makes the summer look calm, when negotiators think they have earned a good rest \u2013 this is the moment to spring a surprise.</p> <p>A debtor's negotiating strategy is to make creditors believe that a collapse would produce some much bigger catastrophe, which can be only be avoided by more concessions and more support. That sense is always more likely when the debtor's action comes without warning \u2013 the financial equivalent of a pre-dawn attack.</p> <p>For now the eurozone leaders' Brussels summit at the end of June looks like the most far-reaching and satisfactory attempt of recent times at European diplomacy. It might look very different in September.</p> <p><em>Harold James is Professor of History and International Affairs at Princeton University and Professor of History at the European University Institute, Florence.

While she could take the produce for free, she feels it is important to pay a small price in order to build loyal relationships with the traders.</p> <p>Her ambition is to open similar kitchens at the two other wholesale fruit and vegetable markets in London as well as in cities such as Manchester, Bristol and Glasgow.</p> <p>She also hopes to diversify into soups and believes the model she is creating could be replicated in other countries.</p> <h2>Making the most of waste</h2> <p>The spark for creating the business came from reading about skip diving and freegans as well as reading the book Waste by Tristram Stuart, which exposed the scandal of 7.2 million tonnes of food and drink being thrown away every year in the UK, costing the country \u00a312bn.</p> <p>She followed this up early one morning by visiting New Covent Garden to see the problem with her own eyes.</p> <p>\"It was cold and dark but the market was bustling with really old-school traders and customers of every type from Chinese to Indians,\" she recalls. \"It felt like a real community with lots of laughter.</p> <p>\"Yet 100 metres away in the car park was an enormous tip and there was lots of produce that was still perfectly good. It felt a terrible shame that for example there were boxes of mange tout all the way from Kenya that were absolutely perfect but were not even making it into the shops.</p> <p>\"I realised it is a problem no one can be blamed for as it is down to an imbalance in supply and demand because it is unpredictable what people will want to buy on any given day.</p> <p>\"I was cycling home when the answer became obvious.

I was brought up on a farm in south-west Scotland and we were always making chutneys and jams.\"</p> <p>As she pondered on how she could turn this idea into a business, she recognised that she could integrate her other main passion in life; helping disadvantaged women.</p> <p>So far she has employed two people but hopes to scale this up once she secures major retail contracts. Ben &amp; Jerry's has offered to help her approach retailers such as Waitrose.</p> <p>\"After leaving the market that first day, I was also thinking about disadvantaged individuals in life and how sometimes they fall off the ladder and are then tainted by that history,\" she says.</p> <p>\"Inside we are all humans but depending on the jobs people have and clothes they wear, we judge who they are as people. Through employment, I want to help give people back their pride and self-belief.\"</p> <h2>A business head with charitable heart</h2> <p>Dawson had considered setting up her venture as a charity but feels NGOs have failed to find the solutions to society's problems and that socially responsible businesses have a greater chance of making a difference.</p> <p>\"Business has to be the new solution to social problems because by making a profit they can be sustainable, and by offering jobs they empower people,\" she says.</p> <p>\"I always believed you can run a company with a business head and a charity heart. I am ambitious and when I put my mind to something I want a result.</p> <p>\"I get excited by competition and having a product and seeing that succeed and if I am going to have a social and environmental impact, I need to sell a lot of jam and chutney.</p> <p>\"I want a business that thrives on many different levels, including ensuring that the people who work with me are getting a great experience and that as a team, we really enjoy its success.\"</p> <p>Dawson has followed in the footsteps of her father, who also quit a job in the City at an early age. He went on to set up a pig farm in Yorkshire before moving to near Castle Douglas where she grew up.</p> <p>She attended young naturalist camps run by her aunt and there were always debates about the environment around the kitchen table. Her love of food and dislike of waste came from the \"fantastic\" food and vegetable garden at home and the constant reminder to finish what was on her plate.</p> <p>\"My mother is known for her rhubarb chutney,\" says Dawson, \"and there was always something boiling away on the stove. She is also rather slapdash and was always changing the flavours depending on whatever was available at the time.\"</p> <p>Dawson's upbringing also instilled in her the attraction of a simple life and the fact that money does not buy happiness.</p> <p>\"Rubies in the Rubble has got to make a profit and I would like to be comfortable but when I was younger, I experienced a high-flying life, and it was not something I got any more happiness out of,\" she says.</p> <p>The chutneys and jams she sells at London's trendy Borough market are at a premium price and Dawson feels it is important that food waste is not something that is considered as second rate.</p> <p>\"At the moment, everything that addresses food waste in the UK is quite charity focused and it is associated with being a second-rate product,\" she says. \"I feel it is important for people to understand that much of this food is first class and there is no difference to what is being sold in the shops.\"</p> <p>While Dawson knows she can make only a tiny dent in the millions of tonnes of food that go to waste every year, she hopes her small contribution will support the growing movement of people who are seeking to address the problem.</p> <p>As a child, she was always aware how other families' fridges were often filled to bursting point and hopes that by purchasing her products and understanding the purpose behind them, consumers will start to move away from unnecessary consumption and put pressure on supermarkets to change their behaviour.</p> <p>While some people have voiced their concern that by using the word \"rubble\" in her brand name, she may put people off, Dawson is adamant to make a point.</p> <p>\"I want to make a statement that there are rubies in the rubble,\" she says. \"We are living in such a gluttonous society where we have so much we don't even need and throw away things well before the end of their natural life. We have become lazy as a result.\"</p> <p>The prize from Ben &amp; Jerry's, which will also be received by country winners in Denmark, Holland, Sweden and Ireland, is \u20ac10,000 plus six months' mentoring from the social enterprise network <a href=\"https://www.ashoka.org/\" title=\"\">Ashoka</a>. The social entrepreneurs' logos will also appear on a special tub of the company's ice cream next year.</p> <p>All of the competition's 14 short-listed candidates returned recently from a week in Uganda where they lived with farmers who supply Fairtrade organic vanilla to Ben &amp; Jerry's, as well as spending time with Ugandan counterparts who are seeking to start their own social businesses.</p> <h2>The challenges of social enterprise in developing countries</h2> <p>Dawson says she went through a huge learning curve, living in a mud hut, bathing communally from a bucket in the garden and not even being able to see the food on her plate because it was so dark.</p> <p>The great eye opener for her, however, was the extraordinary warmth of the local people and the fact that being able to sell at Fairtrade prices has transformed their lives.</p> <p>Dawson shared accommodation with a young Ugandan woman who hopes to set up her own enterprise, but lacks the knowledge and access to training to be able to succeed on her own.</p> <p>At the start of the week, she wanted to create jam out of avocados, which are freely available, but it soon became apparent that glass jars are not available and there is no custom of eating jam in the community.</p> <p>By the end of the week she had decided to focus on briquettes, which are equivalent to charcoal but are cheaper to produce as they are created from dried out waste farming products and help prevent deforestation.</p> <p>\"The difficulties of setting up a business in rural Uganda are immense,\" says Dawson. \"There is not the money or the skills to get projects off the ground. But this is where NGOs can make a difference by moving away from charity to supporting the creation of profitable businesses.</p> <p>\"I worked with Maureen in developing a business plan and she is going to email it once it is finished. If she is really committed, then I will do my best to help her to finance it. We became really close while I was out there.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

Yet as the country waits for Friday when an Oslo court passes its verdict on the mass killer Anders Breivik, cracks in the country's famed culture of tolerance are starting to show.</p> <p>There is a growing consensus that Norway's feeling of national unity, symbolised by the huge \"rose marches\" in which hundreds of thousands marched in defiance after the attacks, has slowly ebbed away as the country becomes divided over the issues of rising immigration and cultural integration.</p> <p>Some experts believe that anti-immigrant antipathy has now slid back to levels that existed before Breivik, a far-right militant, slaughtered 77 people last year.</p> <p>Thorbj\u00f8rn Jagland, the Norwegian chairman of the Nobel peace prize committee, is among those who believe nothing has been learnt in the 13 months since the attacks.</p> <p>Jagland, a former prime minister of Norway and now general secretary of the Council of Europe, told the Guardian that while the atrocities had dampened the anti-multicultural rhetoric of politicians, the sentiments remained. \"I don't think we have changed much in the past year. People at the political level have been more cautious regarding the debate around integration and Muslims, but if you look at what is going on at the grassroots level it has not changed,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Xenophobic tendencies are still there; there is still a lot of hatred against immigrants; fears of multiculturalism remain. Look at debates online, they are still very much what we had before.\"</p> <p>The eastern Oslo district of Gr\u00f8nland is Norway's most vividly multicultural neighbourhood. Here, among the tandoori takeaways, mosques and Vietnamese supermarkets, is where Norway's newest arrivals typically end up. Its skyline is dotted with cranes and scaffolding, a visual reminder that Oslo is Europe's fastest-growing city.</p> <p>Driving the growth is an influx of foreign workers. Norway's population rose 1.3% last year, itself one of the highest rates in Europe. Net immigration accounted for 71% of growth.</p> <p>But in an episode last month that would have been unthinkable during the scenes of national solidarity witnessed immediately after Breivik struck, the arrival of Roma refugees in Norway provoked a hateful backlash.</p> <p>Death threats surfaced on Norwegian online forums and a Roma camp was attacked with fireworks and stones. Three weeks ago, Siv Jensen, leader of the populist rightwing Progress party, of which Breivik was a former member, demanded that the Roma refugees be deported.</p> <p>Bente Guro M\u00f8ller, who founded Oslo's Intercultural Museum in 1990, believes that after a brief period of enlightenment following the attacks, attitudes to integration have regressed.</p> <p>\"Things have gone back to where they were. When I started out I thought our anti-racist work would be done in 10 years, now we don't dare set a date.\"</p> <p>Her colleague, Daniella van Dijk-Wennberg, a Dutch immigrant who has lived in Oslo since 1993, said: \"There is a lot of unspoken aggression against immigrants. Norway is no different in that respect.</p> <p>\"It changed a lot in the beginning [after the attacks], but the good feeling has worn out.\"</p> <p>She said Oslo remained broadly split into two, the river Akerselva dividing a largely homogeneous population with the city's multicultural society in the east. Some residents in the west of Oslo, she said, would not cross the Akerselva.</p> <p>Jagland blames such attitudes on the continued \"distortion\" of the immigration debate during mainstream political discussions.</p> <p>He said Norway \u2013 which has more than \u00a3300bn in reserves from its oil fund \u2013 requires large numbers of foreign workers to keep expanding. \"It needs to be explained how dependent we are on immigration.\"</p> <p>The memory of the attacks, however, continues to galvanise the younger generation. Breivik killed 69 people during his attack on the Labour party's youth wing, the AUF, on Ut\u00f8ya island. But his hopes of eradicating the next generation of Labour politicians has spectacularly backfired \u2013 instead it has inspired thousands to join up.</p> <p>Eskil Pedersen, the 29-year-old head of the AUF, said that one \"beautiful\" byproduct of the horror was seeing how young Norwegians still believed democracy could defeat extremism.</p> <p>Pedersen, who Breivik has admitted was one of his top targets, but who escaped the island on a ferry during the shootings, said: \"We have been travelling around the country and the implication is that politics is cooler, but also more important.\" Membership of the AUF has increased during the last year from 9,600 to 14,000.</p> <p>Some, though, believe the recent success of the anti-immigrant Progress party has countered such enthusiasm. The party suffered significantly after 22 July, yet it has steadily clawed back support. One recent poll suggests the party has more than 22% support among voters.</p> <p>Yet while the Progress party appears resurgent, Norway's far-right nexus remains tiny. Tor Bach, of Norway's far-right monitoring group Vepsen, said the policies of the Progress party meant there was little political oxygen for them to evolve. Riven by factionalism, their numbers are measured in dozens.</p> <p>Bach said: \"Being a rightwing extremist in Norway is a pretty miserable affair. It must be a sad, dull life.</p> <p>\"But as a society it feels very much the same. It hasn't changed. At one time it felt this would change society forever but what happened was so extreme it feels unreal.\"</p> <p>Kari Helene Partapuoli, of Oslo's Anti-Racist Centre, believes the attacks should have been a watershed moment in redefining attitudes to immigration and integration.</p> <p>Yet Norway still does not record hate crimes and, Partapuoli said, the attacks had not led to government schemes to improve cultural awareness. She said: \"Hopefully, we would have realised that hatred can inspire actions, but I don't think we have learnt that lesson.\"</p>",
  "<p>Allow me to sketch you a verbal portrait of my current Everyday Handbag. I bought it two, maybe three years ago and it's a khaki green cross-body Marc Jacobs boho bag. It has two brass doves on the front (sounds ghastly, it's not). It cost the most I've ever spent on a handbag and when it was delivered to my desk I ran around Guardian Towers like a proper idiot showing it off to anybody who might conceivably have an interest (including a confused editor). I stroked it. I kissed it. I adored its buttery soft leather and colourful lining. I loved that it had Marc Jacobs discreetly imprinted on the buckles. I gave daily thanks for its multitude of pockets, all of them in the right place and all of them the right size. I have hauled that bag around with me everywhere. But it is, oh woe, reaching the end of the line. The colour has rubbed off here and there, it has more than its fair share of scuffs and scratches, there is a biro mark on the back and when I noticed the stitching coming apart on the shoulder strap I widened the needle holes and threaded grosgrain ribbon through, tying it up in a jaunty bow. That bag has lived.</p> <p>But sadly it's time to buy a new Everyday Bag. It's difficult. The problem is that I always start off by looking for the exact same thing as the deceased item, or something as close to it as I can get. This is a doomed mission because bags morph every season and, if you care about such things, it is necessary to find one that won't immediately date itself when the calendar flips over into April and we're back into spring/summer 2013 as opposed to autumn/winter 2012. My Everyday Bag must also have separate pockets for my Oyster card, mobile phone, pens and loose change. There must be a separate zipper pocket for my purse (big enough to be almost a bag itself). The body of the bag must be large enough to accommodate a small notebook, a pocket brolly and my Kindle but not be so large that things sift their way down to the bottom and get lost in a primordial stew of fluff, paper clips, hair bungees and blister plasters. The strap must be long enough to fit over my shoulder (I don't do The Elbow Crook) or to go across my body and distribute the weight evenly, but without rearranging my bosom into the \"three-breasted courier\". The colour must be neutral. Mission Impossible then, but without the option of \"should you choose to accept it\".</p> <p>Most of my searches for a specific item start on the internet, where it's possible to shop around and research without wearing out shoe leather and patience (note to websites: please show the inside of the bag as well, and a picture of someone carrying it is useful for scale.) I'd never thought about <a href=\"http://jaeger.co.uk/Accessories_Bags?pagesize=500&amp;productpage=1&amp;viewall=true\" title=\"\">Jaeger for bags</a> but they do have a good range of classic Everyday Bags and many are substantially reduced in the sale. Net-a-Porter, as you might expect, has a huge range and it's easily searchable by colour and style, or designer if you're that way inclined. The same can be said for Matches or My Wardrobe. Don't be put off by price \u2013 this is research and it's almost always possible to find something similar if you like a particular style. Or you could knock yourself out and customise a cheaper bag yourself. Ebay is good but obviously you should approach with caution: if it says Chanel and it's 50 quid, it's not Chanel and not worth 50 quid. Caveat emptor: if it says it's Chanel and it's 500 big ones it still might not be Chanel, so be savvy and sensible and be prepared to walk away. Once I know what I'm looking for I'll be off scouring TK Maxx and the many excellent London markets for good quality look-alikes, by which I don't mean knock-offs, which is wrong, wrong, WRONG and a subject for another column.</p> <p>For the moment I'm very much taken with a <a href=\"http://www.net-a-porter.com/product/313012\" title=\"\">Proenza Schouler extra large satchel in purply blue leather</a> but I'm nowhere near mad enough to spend 1600 smackers on a bag. Or maybe I will when I'm 80 and don't care - when, like the poem, I'm spending all my money on red hats and sausages.</p> <p>Follow The Invisible Woman on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/thevintageyear\" title=\"\">Twitter @TheVintageYear</a></p>",
  "<p>\"One person can make a difference. It's the theme that runs through the stories I write and the books I cherish. It's also the foundation of the amazing work Amnesty International has accomplished over the years. Amnesty harnesses the power of ordinary people from around the world and encourages them to stand up for human rights. </p> <p>At the Edinburgh International Book Festival, I had the chance to discuss with teachers and librarians how books can serve as conversation starters on human rights, using my debut novel Dark Parties as an example. </p> <p>For me, writing fiction is an exercise in creativity and debate. I want to challenge myself as a storyteller but also consider important issues. I write not because I have the answer but because I'm interested in the question. Dark Parties asks \u2013 what would happen if a country closed its borders to people and ideas? I wanted to explore issues of personal and national identity as well as diversity and human rights. </p> <p>My 16-year-old main character Neva lives in a country that has closed itself for hundreds of years under an electrified dome. Its resources are dwindling and its citizens are dying. Neva and her best friend dream of a life outside this protective dome. They stage a rebellion and uncover secrets and lies that threaten Neva's friends, family and country. She must decide what she will sacrifice for freedom. </p> <p>I enjoy writing and reading books that entertain and explore interesting and timely issues. But there's a fine line between raising issues and preaching a point of view. Some teen books preach rather than persuade. Listed below are 10 books that strike the right balance between pace and meaning and dare their readers to think for themselves.\"</p> <p>Sara Grant was born and raised in a small town in the Midwestern United States.

Its message of equality rings as true today \u2013 and is as important \u2013 as when it was written in 1960.</p> <h2>3. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780316049979\">Freaks and Revelations by Davida Wills Hurwin</a> </h2> <p>This book \u2013 based on a true story \u2013 is heartbreaking. I was absolutely sobbing by the end. Not choked up or misty-eyed but sobbing. Told in alternating perspectives, it follows two teens \u2013 one a neo-Nazi and the other gay \u2013 on their crash course to a hate crime that will change both their lives. It's tragic and yet hopeful. </p> <h2>4. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781444001839\">My Sister Lives on the Mantelpiece by Annabel Pitcher </a></h2> <p>The voice of narrator 10-year-old Jamie leaps off the page. I loved his quirky way of looking at life. His family has been devastated by a terrorist act. The book tackles many issues \u2013 racism, injustice, and bullying to name a few \u2013 but at its heart is a wonderful story of friendship and acceptance.</p> <h2>5. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781407109084\">The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins</a></h2> <p>Sure, you can take this book at face value. It's an action-packed dystopian tale of a fight to the death. But there's also a commentary on society's perverse fascination with reality television. Heroes and villains are created and lives destroyed all in the name of entertainment. </p> <h2>6. Going Bovine by Libba Bray </h2> <p>This story takes you on an ab-so-lutely bizarre quest. Cameron, a teen boy suffering from mad-cow disease; a dwarf; a punk angel; and a garden gnome, who may be a Viking god, search for a cure for Cameron's fatal disease \u2013 and the meaning of life. You will need to read this book more than once to absorb its rich layers. Get ready for a real test of your imagination and, well, your sanity!</p> <h2>7. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780552555708\">Noughts and Crosses by Malorie Blackman </a></h2> <p>This is a Romeo and Juliet-style romance but it's so much more. Its premise turns prejudice upside down. It's one of those books that propels you to the final page but stays with you long after you've closed the book.</p> <h2>8. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780747570639\">A Gathering Light by Jennifer Donnelly</a></h2> <p>This is a story within a story about two young women whose lives link in the summer of 1906 at Big Moose Lake. The end of one life is revealed in letters discovered by the other. There's murder and romance, but at its core is one young writer struggling to realise her dream. I've read this book twice \u2013 once for sheer pleasure and the second time with pencil in hand. I wanted to dissect it and figure out how it captivated me in a way few books have before or since. I realised that I may be able to diagram its many plots and list its cast of characters but what Donnelly has created takes a little bit of magic.</p> <h2>9. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780860685111\">I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings by Maya Angelou</a></h2> <p>This is the only non-fiction title on my list. The beloved American poet recounts her tumultuous childhood. It's an inspiring story of one girl's ability to overcome racism and violence and still be able to find beauty and poignancy in the world. </p> <h2>10. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781846143830\">The Giving Tree by Shel Silverstein</a> </h2> <p>Ok, this isn't a teen book. I received this picture book when I was a child, and it still touches me every time I read it. It's about one boy's love for a tree and vice versa \u2013 and unconditional love. The plot may sound strange but the book demonstrates that few words and the starkest of illustrations are necessary to capture your heart.</p> <p>And because it's difficult to stop at 10, I'd like to direct you to two other book lists. I'm part of a group of authors who create fiction for teens. We've joined forces because our books deal with important issues such as alcoholism, asylum seekers, knife crime and medical ethics. I'd recommend any book by EDGE authors. You can check out our books and our list of edgy reads at: <a href=\"http://edgeauthors.blogspot.com\">http://edgeauthors.blogspot.com</a>. Amnesty also has developed a list of inspiring books. Visit the education section of the Amnesty site for their reading list at <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org.uk/education\">amnesty.org.uk/education</a>.</p> <p>I hope these books will inspire you but I also hope you'll do more than read about rebellion. Be part of the change that Amnesty makes in the world every day. Amnesty campaigns to protect people wherever justice, fairness, freedom and truth are denied.

  "<p>One fugitive from justice fights for human rights, the other for those of animals. Both have long histories of confronting governments and legions of passionate supporters. And now both have skipped bail in foreign countries to avoid extradition to much more powerful nations which they believe want to try them for political reasons. But the similarities between WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, and Paul Watson, charismatic founder of radical marine enforcement organisation <a href=\"http://www.seashepherd.org/\" title=\"\">Sea Shepherd</a>, end there.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/aug/19/julian-assange-us-war-whistleblowers\" title=\"\">Assange is holed up very publicly in the Ecuadorean embassy in London</a> to avoid being sent back to Sweden where he faces questioning on sexual assault charges but fears he will be extradited to the US.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jul/26/paul-watson-skips-bail-germany\" title=\"\">Watson has disappeared after skipping bail in Germany in the face of allegations by Costa Rica</a> \u2013 strongly denied by Watson \u2013 that he endangered the lives of some of its shark finners back in 2002. The Canadian-born environmentalist who co-founded Greenpeace and has waged a 40 years' war against illegal fishing and marine destruction faced extradition requests from both Costa Rica and Japan, against whom Sea Shepherd have waged a long and bitter war over whales in the Antarctic.</p> <p>But where is Captain Watson? This week I left messages around the world for him in an attempt to invite him to write a piece for the Guardian. Oliver Wallasch, his lawyer in Germany was not taking calls, nor was the European director of Sea Shepherd. The organisation's US HQ in California referred me to <a href=\"http://www.seashepherd.org/news-and-media/2012/08/11/setting-the-record-straight-on-paul-watsons-status-1425\" title=\"\">his legal status on their website</a>, and Watson himself was not answering his US or European phones.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the bridge of the Sea Shepherd flagship, the Steve Irwin, took a call as it steamed off the Western Australian coast but the message was clear: \"We have no idea where Captain Watson is.\" Only his PR company said they had been in contact with him in the past few weeks, receiving several emails from him. But they, too, said they had no idea where he was.</p> <p>The best bet is that Watson is at sea \u2013 his home. Last year he told me he only spent a few days a year on land, and his lawyer last month said that he felt he [Watson] thought he could be of more use to his clients \u2013 the whales and fish \u2013 on a ship than he could in a German or Japanese prison. But if he is not on the Steve Irwin, could he possibly be on either of Sea Shepherd's <a href=\"http://www.seashepherd.org/who-we-are/the-fleet.html\" title=\"\">two other boats, the Brigitte Bardot and the Bob Barker</a>? Both are thought to be in Australian waters preparing, like the Steve Irwin, for a new anti-whaling campaign in the Antarctic against the Japanese, starting in December. Neither ship could be contacted but anyway, it seems unlikely he could have left Europe without the authorities noticing.</p> <p>So could he still be in Europe? The Guardian has been told that his daughter and the head of Sea Shepherd's European office had been seen in Amsterdam. But equally, it was claimed that he may be seeking political <a href=\"http://selvavidasinfronteras.wordpress.com/2012/07/30/the-amazon-pink-dolphins-voice-chilean-senator-juan-pablo-letelier-requested-to-accelerate-political-asylum-for-sea-shepherds-captain-paul-watson/\" title=\"\">asylum in Chile</a> through senator Juan Pablo Letelier, who, it appears, has been asked to \"accelerate political asylum for Watson\".</p> <p>Much more likely is that Captain Watson will apply for political asylum, like Assange, in Ecuador, where President Correa has a strong human rights record and where Sea Shepherd has a long history of working with the national police and the Gal\u00e1pagos to catch illegal fishers and apprehend the shark mafia. The organisation was in 2005 even granted the power to arrest people believed to be fishing illegally and in 2007 Sea Shepherd donated their old US coastguard boat to the marine national park. <a href=\"http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&amp;dat=20070805&amp;id=1p8_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OlYMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2994,5962434\" title=\"\">Although Correa once expelled Sea Shepherd's Ecuadorean representative, Sean O'Hearn</a>, relations were patched up and Watson has been very complimentary about Correa.</p> <p>The last hint that Ecuador may be the preferred destination of Watson is that he is known to be good friends with Mariana Almeida, head of Ecuador's vibrant Life Without Frontiers ecological foundation. In a letter to a US website, <a href=\"http://www.dallasblog.com/201207311009291/dallas-blog/international-environment-mission-letter-to-dallas-blog.html\" title=\"\">she recently wrote</a> with apparent knowledge of the legal case Watson's legal team may be expecting to pursue:</p> <blockquote> \"The case of Captain Watson would also be presented to the pertinent human rights commissions and organisations and shall be placed on the agenda of the European parliament, the international agreements shall be respected and it is clear that Germany might need to explain to the European parliament the reason to accept the extradition request from a Caribbean country without an extradition agreement.\" </blockquote> <p>It's not conclusive, but Watson needs all the friends on land that he has got right now. He has proved many times that he is the master of maritime law but whether he can now outwit an array of governments led by the powerful Japanese, may define the rest of his buccaneering life.</p>",
  "<p>Roberto Mancini has confirmed Sergio Ag\u00fcero should be out for less than a month due to the knee injury he sustained in Manchester City's win over Southampton on Sunday. The manager is hopeful the striker will be back for City's game with Stoke at the Etihad Stadium on 15 September.</p> <p>\"I don't think Sergio will be out for long and we are hoping he will be back after the international break, which is fantastic news for him and for us,\" said Mancini. \"We were worried a couple of days ago because we feared he could be out for six months or maybe even more which would have been very bad news</p> <p>\" It looked like a verystrange injury and because it was his knee, we were obviously very concerned so this news is a relief for everybody.\"</p> <p>On Tuesday, Ag\u00fcero tweeted: \"Thank you all for your concern. I'm better but still resting with an ice pack on the swollen area. And very eager to start recovery physio tomorrow! I'll keep you posted. All the best!\"</p> <p>Ag\u00fcero will still definitely miss Sunday's game at Liverpool and the visit of Queens Park Rangers the following Saturday.</p> <p>Mancini was also encouraged by the progress of Gareth Barry, who has an abdominal muscle problem and trained on Wednesday, and Micah Richards, who has an ankle problem.</p> <p>\"Gareth will also be ready after the international break,\" said the Italian. \"He hasn't played any games for almost four months and he needs to build his fitness up, but he is training again and I don't see him being out for any longer than one month and hopefully, maybe just a couple of weeks.</p> <p>\"Micah's injury is more serious and he could be out a little longer, but having said that, with rest and the right treatment, we are hopeful he could be ready in about one month, which again would be great&#xa0;news.\"</p> <p>City will be looking to press their advantage over Manchester United, who lost their opening game, 1-0 at Everton, on Monday evening.</p>",
  "<p>\"We should stop the window when the first game is played; then all this nonsense would stop.\" Martin Jol is a Mill reader! Oh. \"If you look at the window now with two weeks to go, it's awful because there are a lot of clubs waiting around until they get the money in [from sales] and if they have got the money then they will come in and of course then you have players with clauses as well, so I think we should do something about it.\" Amen, brother. The Mill has been up all night sorting out this domino trail of potential deals; one false move and before you know it <strong>Bristol City owe Porto \u00a345m for Kieran Richardson</strong>, so long as West Ham sign <strong>Sarah Cracknell on loan from St Etienne</strong>.</p> <p>Closing the transfer window before the start of the season would at least save Tottenham Hotspur from themselves. Internacional have apparently said that they are only <strong>open to an \"extraordinary\" offer for Leandro Dami\u00e3o</strong>, which roughly translates to about \u00a324m. Shakhtar Donetsk want an \"oof, quite a lot\" offer of <strong>\u00a320m for Willian</strong>, but that hasn't stopped the Daily Mail reporting that both deals are going through. According to the Times, if either makes it as far as a medical, <strong>Jermain Defoe will be off to Sunderland </strong>in exchange for the \"go on then\" sum of \u00a310m. If you take a peak in the Mirror (who reckon Atl\u00e9tico Madrid's Falcao is also on the list of strikers Spurs will inquire about and then recoil at the price), the newly appointed club captain Michael Dawson's \u00a39m move to QPR will fund the signing of Ricardo Carvalho. A truly bizarre bit of business.</p> <p><strong>Spurs are also being linked with Adam Johnson</strong>, whose move away from Manchester City depends on the arrival of Scott Sinclair, for whom Swansea would like \u00a36m, not the offered \u00a35m, so that they'll have plenty of change after replacing him with either the <strong>Bristol City winger Albert Adomah or Middlesbrough's Marvin Emnes</strong> \u2013 both available for around \u00a33m. Stare at a spot in the distance for a moment to uncross your eyes. So, Adam Johnson: his preference is for a move to Tottenham or Liverpool, but only Sunderland have actually <strong>tabled a \u00a310m bid</strong>.</p> <p>Martin O'Neill is having a giddy old time of it at the moment, bidding like a bairn who has accidentally opened up Pa's eBay account. <strong>It looks as though Steven Fletcher will be arriving at any moment</strong>, with Wolves having accepted a second chance offer of about \u00a312m. If Kieran Richardson can be flogged to a London club for a couple of million quid, the Blackburn full-back Martin Olsson could be the next arrival at the Stadium of Light \u2013 assuming that Aiden McGeady and Clint Dempsey don't get there first.</p> <p>Roberto Mancini needs to boost his kitty before Manchester City can be turned down by another big-money target, so <strong>off goes Kolo Tour\u00e9 to Lazio or PSG</strong> if the papers are to be believed; John Guidetti, who went on loan to Feyenoord last season, could end up at Sunderland (wa dominoes!); and <strong>Roque Santa Cruz seems likely to sign for Real Betis </strong>having turned down loan moves to Middlesbrough and Celtic. There's a strong chance he'll still need some extra pocket money to sign Javi Mart\u00ednez from Athletic Bilbao. Mart\u00ednez is currently in the midst of agreeing a deal with Bayern Munich, but with negotiations stuck somewhere around \u00a335m, City fancy they can cut in. Otherwise, it's a straight scrap between them and Spurs for the <strong>FC Ashdod midfielder Nir Biton</strong>, the latest poor soul to be dubbed <strong>\"the new Vieira\"</strong>.</p> <p>The Chelsea manager Roberto Di Matteo feels he's \"a bit light in attacking positions\", which has prompted the Star to furnish their back page with a story saying that <strong>Andr\u00e9 Schurrle is on his way from Bayer Leverkusen for \u00a323.5m</strong>. According to the Mail, however, Leverkusen \"will not sell him this season no matter how much they offer\". Fortunately Chelsea fans only read Frank Lampard's beloved Sun, so will be under the impression that the club is about to <strong>pay \u00a335m to prise Edinson Cavani from Napoli</strong> \u2013 or, failing that, <strong>\u00a345m for Porto's Hulk</strong>. Some, though not a lot, of which could be funded by the cash Crystal Palace pay to take Ga\u00ebl Kakuta on loan for the season.</p> <p><strong>Manchester United are also offloading fringe players</strong>, a sentence that Dimitar Berbatov should never have ended up in. He's about to enrich the lives of Fiorentina supporters for the princely sum of \u00a33m; by those figures, Federico Macheda and B\u00e9b\u00e9 will be sold for \u00a312.99 and 75p respectively. Nani probably isn't going anywhere, mind, with United only prepared to do business at \u00a325m+ and <strong>Zenit St Petersburg not that stupid</strong>. What that means for United's chances of signing Pachuca and the Mexico midfielder Hector Herrera the Mill can no longer tell.</p> <p>Queens Park Rangers are <strong>in talks with Paris Saint-Etienne regarding Kurt Zouma</strong>, the young defender valued at about \u00a38m, and will make some cash back by selling Tommy Smith to Cardiff. Joey Barton's loan move to Marseille could be scuppered by the Football Association, who have asked the French federation to uphold his 12-match ban. Still, who wouldn't want 11 weeks free to read a bit of Sartre, write out Smiths lyrics in an exercise book, and work on pronouncing acatalepsy? <strong>Mark Hughes is also thinking about signing goalkeeper Artur Boruc on a free</strong>, having woken drenched in sweat at the realisation that Robert Green is his No1. On the other side of London, West Ham have increased their offer for <strong>Matt Jarvis </strong>to about \u00a310m, and are close to a loan deal for the Rennes striker Razak Boukari.</p> <p>Staying in London, because that's the best segue the Mill can think of at the moment, <strong>Arsenal could yet miss out on Nuri Sahin</strong>, because Real Madrid like the colour of Liverpool's money better \u2013 they're prepared to agree a loan deal that involves a \u00a314m buyout clause if Sahin decides to stay. That may or may not be because they've got a cheque for \u00a312m on its way from Newcastle, who've now said they won't bid any higher for a player that Liverpool don't want anyway. <strong>Which seems fair enough.</strong></p> <p>On his way out of Newcastle, eventually, is Danny Simpson, who doesn't feel he's being paid his worth at \u00a320,000 a week, and plans to sign a pre-contract agreement with Espanyol in January. By then <strong>Blackburn hope that Huddersfield's Jordan Rhodes will have scored at least 20 goals</strong> for them, having signed before the window closed for \u00a36m.</p>",

It wants to comply with a court request that Assange should be sent to Sweden for questioning. Assange's supporters have tried to discredit the allegations, saying they are part of a plot to extradite him to the US.</p> <p>Senior politicians in Ecuador have implied much the same. Correas added his voice but said the case needed to be answered. \"I don't want to judge allegations that have not been proven and would not, in any case, be considered a felony in Latin American, too,\" he said. \"It has never been the intention of the Ecuadorean government for Julian Assange not to respond to those allegations.\"</p> <p>Ecuador has proposed interrogations by Swedish investigators on embassy property and has said it would support Assange going to Sweden if it could get reassurances from the UK government that he would not then be extradited to the US.</p> <p>Critics say this is grandstanding for domestic political reasons. Correa \u2013 already Ecuador's longest serving president for a century \u2013 will contest an election early next year. Although his support rates are high, one of his least popular moves has been to assert greater control over the media through lawsuits, referenda and closures of radio stations. Providing a haven for Assage \u2013 a champion of whistleblowers \u2013 may be designed to offset these negative perceptions.</p> <p>During the Q&amp;A on Tuesday Correa addressed this issue and defending an offensive against TV, radio and print. \"Don't let yourself be fooled by what's going. There is this image of the media as being about Woodward and Bernstein and Watergate and the struggle for freedom of expression. But that isn't the case here.\" </p> <p>The reality, he said, was more like the the novel Pantanle\u00f3n y las Visitadoras by Mario Vargas Llosa. \"Instead of grabbing the news they are blackmailing people. The press in Latin America is totally corrupt,\" he said.</p>"
