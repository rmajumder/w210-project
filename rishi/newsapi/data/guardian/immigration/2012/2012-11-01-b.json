In the Republican primaries, candidates queued up to pour scorn on the very notion of man-made climate change. And now Bloomberg has made their party \u2013 which he was once a member of \u2013 pay the ultimate political price.</p> <p>Bloomberg then fires a lethal shot at Romney:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I believe Mitt Romney is a good and decent man, and he would bring valuable business experience to the Oval Office. He understands that America was built on the promise of equal opportunity, not equal results. In the past he has also taken sensible positions on immigration, illegal guns, abortion rights and health care. But he has reversed course on all of them, and is even running against the health-care model he signed into law in Massachusetts.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Interestingly, a close reading of Bloomberg essay makes it seem that he was planning to endorse Obama before Sandy.

Of course, he knows in current circumstances no sane person would really push defence spending, projected to fall below 3% of GDP, to 4%; of course President Romney would strike a deal that raises overall tax revenues, even if he cuts tax rates.</p> <p>However, even if you accept that Romneynomics may be more numerate in practice than it is in theory, it is far harder to imagine that he will reverse course entirely. When politicians get elected they tend to do quite a lot of the things they promised during their campaigns. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, France\u2019s famously pliable new president, was supposed to be too pragmatic to introduce a 75% top tax rate, yet he is steaming ahead with his plan. We weren\u2019t fooled by the French left; we see no reason why the American right will be more flexible. Mr Romney, like Mr Hollande, will have his party at his back \u2014 and a long record of pandering to them.</p> </blockquote> <p>Well that's the Balliol College SCR vote gone for Romney. Finally, the Economist concludes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Many of <em>The Economist</em>\u2019s readers, especially those who run businesses in America, may well conclude that nothing could be worse than another four years of Mr Obama. We beg to differ.

Internal surveys conducted for candidates like George Allen in Virginia, Richard Mourdock in Indiana and Josh Mandel in Ohio draw much rosier conclusions than polls conducted for their Democratic counterparts Tim Kaine, Joe Donnelly and Sherrod Brown. And media surveys, at least in Virginia and Ohio, show Kaine and Brown winning (restrictive Indiana laws make polling prohibitively expensive there).</p> <p>Republicans say their party is a victim of media bias \u2013 but not in the standard Lamestream Media sort of way. Pollsters on both sides try to persuade public surveyors that their voter turnout models are more accurate reflections of what's going to happen on Election Day. This year, GOP pollsters and strategists believe those nonpartisan pollsters are adopting Democratic turnout models <em>en masse</em>.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Reid's conclusion:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Republicans believe Democrats are counting far too much on low-propensity voters and a booming minority turnout that isn't going to materialize on Election Day. Democrats believe Republicans are hopelessly reliant on an electorate that looks far more like their party than the nation as a whole. The day after Election Day, somebody's pollsters are going to be proven seriously wrong.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-01T17:05:24.997Z\">at 5.05pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5092a8b695cb1506d24446df\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-01T16:52:06.508Z\">4.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Obama for America is back on the offensive with another smack at <strong>Mitt Romney</strong>'s \"let Detroit go bankrupt\" comment.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP41ogzwsBk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FP41ogzwsBk?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>There's no telling how much damage a dumb remark can do \u2013 and this is an example of something that was never an issue in the GOP primary \u2013 Romney won <strong>Michigan</strong> \u2013 but blows up big time in the general election.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5092a3bfb579f74bac7648de\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-01T16:30:55.588Z\">4.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Nate Silver v Joe Scarborough</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>For fans of media-politics inside baseball: Many <strong>Republicans</strong> and <strong>Politico</strong> have been engaged in bizarre guerrilla warfare aimed at the <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/\">New York Times' polling guru</a> <strong>Nate Silver</strong>, whose election model was the only thing keeping the Democratic party from headless panic while the Romney surge was at its height last month.</p> <p>The motivations of the those involved at throwing mud at Silver is suspect \u2013 the Republicans because it punctures their narrative of inevitable Mittmentum and Politico because of jealousy.

They were the favourites. Amazingly, though, no newspapers (including us) managed to review Alt-J's album when it came out, it really did creep in under the radar.</p> <p>Luckily our New Band Of The Day man Paul Lester was available to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/may/24/new-band-alt-j\">write up his assessment back in May: </a></p> <blockquote> <p>The music is rich and quirky enough to match the imagistic literacy of the lyrics, from the majestic, cinematic sweep of Intro onwards.</p> </blockquote> <p>Lester went on to say</p> <blockquote> <p>Even if you remain indifferent about the album, as we do, you can easily see why people are going to like it and spend time seeking out the meanings and motives behind the songs.</p> </blockquote> <p>Maybe the band's oblique lyrics swayed the judges? We will never know, of course, as they like to keep their discussions hush hush. Much like the atmosphere in this room right now, if I'm being honest. A polite acceptance by the lads was the order of the day, rather than a gak-fuelled rant a la Klaxons.</p> <p>Personally, I'm not sure Alt-J's An Awesome Wave is really the time capsule sound of British music in 2012 but, you know, it has its moments I guess. And with that thrillingly passionate statement I must sign off for another year. Thanks so much for reading.

And it would please @robjam down in comment land too, who is rather annoyed at my lack of jazz knowledge. </p> <blockquote> <p>You clearly know nothing about jazz in general, or Roller Trio in particular. It's a good album - not quite a great album - but it could only have been made in the last 2 or 3 years (you would know this if you knew anything at all about contemporary jazz). It belongs to a movement which features bands such as TrioVD &amp; Troyka which is absolutely contemporary, growing out of the work of bands like Polar Bear &amp; Acoustic Ladyland from 6 or 7 years ago, &amp; further propelled by outfits such as Led Bib &amp; Get the Blessing from 3 or 4 years ago.</p> </blockquote> <p>Fair enough.

Regular readers \u2013 <em>fans</em>, if you must \u2013 of what are routinely described as \u201cTim Jonze\u2019s era-defining Mercury live blogs\u201d (copyright: absolutely nobody, ever) may recall a sentence from<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2011/sep/06/mercury-prize-2011-live-blog\"> last year\u2019s masterpiece</a>. Laced with pathos and poignant beyond mere words, I turned to you dear reader and said: \u201cOh Lord, please don't let me be live blogging this thing again next year.\u201d</p> <p>And yet the Lord was clearly one of the few people not reading, so here I am once more, gearing up for my fourth Mercury Music Awards live blog. I guess when you\u2019re in demand, you\u2019re in demand. Especially when no other fool will volunteer for it.</p> <p>I can\u2019t lie, readers, this year\u2019s Mercury nominees list is not a vintage one. There are no obvious landmark records a la the xx\u2019s debut, or PJ Harvey\u2019s masterpiece Let England Shake. Instead we have a lot of wispy washy indie music \u2013 hot favourites Alt-J, The Maccabees \u2013 and a generous serving of retro folk, soul and psychedelia (Ben Howard, Michael Kiwanuka, Lianne La Havas, Richard Hawley). Only Plan B and Jessie Ware stand out as having made music that sounds like it could possibly have been recorded after the Watergate scandal, so let\u2019s hope they get rewarded for this. After all, the Mercury Prize is all about invention, no?</p> <p>We\u2019re at the Roundhouse this year, and will be watching it while hunched over a laptop from a slightly different balcony (we're all about variety). We're led to believe that it all kicks off around 7pm. Do let me know your tips, favourites and who the judges have mercilessly overlooked. You can email me on <a href=\"mailto:tim.jonze@guardian.co.uk\">tim.jonze@guardian.co.uk</a> or tweet me <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/timjonze\">@timjonze</a>. And I\u2019ll probably ignore you all because I'm too busy trying to locate a WiFi signal somewhere on a wobbly stool at the back of the venue.</p> <p>Anyway, the nominees are as follows (in completely random cut'n'paste order, because we are that impartial) ...</p> <ul> <li>LIanne La Havas \u2013 Is Your Love Big Enough</li> <li>Ben Howard \u2013 Every Kingdom</li> <li>Michael Kiwanuka \u2013 Home Again</li> <li>The Maccabees \u2013 Given To The Wild</li> <li>Richard Hawley \u2013 Standing At The Sky\u2019s Edge</li> <li>Roller Trio \u2013 Roller Trio</li> <li>Django Django \u2013 Django Django</li> <li>Plan B - Ill Manors</li> <li>Jessie Ware - Devotion</li> <li>Alt-J - An Awesome Wave</li> <li>Field Music \u2013 Plumb</li> <li>Sam Lee \u2013 Ground Of It\u2019s Own</li> </ul> <p>And here's a fun video \u2013 dripping with infectious enthusiasm, I'm sure you'll agree \u2013 of me, Rebecca Nicholson and Alexis Petridis discussing the nominees.

  "<p>Today is the 95th anniversary of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration\" title=\"\">Balfour Declaration</a>, when the then foreign secretary, Arthur Balfour, signed a fateful letter to Lord Rothschild announcing that the British government \"view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a National Home for the Jewish people\". Britain thus gave the zionist movement carte blanche to transform the overwhelmingly Arab state of Palestine into a Jewish one.</p> <p>To further this aim, from 1920 onwards, Britain encouraged the mass immigration into Palestine of hundreds of thousands of European Jews, expressly against the wishes of the majority population. As Palestine descended into chaos, the British washed their hands of their responsibility for the mess they had caused and stood by while hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were terrorised into fleeing their homeland, as Palestine was transformed into Israel.</p> <p>We call for the British government to acknowledge publicly the responsibility of previous British administrations from 1917 to 1948 for the catastrophe that befell the Palestinians, when over threequarters were expelled deliberately and systematically by the zionist army. Most of them remain refugees today without redress. The truth about their expulsions is still not officially established, since Israel officially denies any responsibility for it.<br><strong>Ghada Karmi</strong><br><strong>Tim Llewellyn</strong><br><strong>Karl Sabbagh</strong><br><strong>John Rose</strong><br><strong>Kamel Hawwash</strong><br><strong>Naomi Foyle</strong><br><strong>Mona Baker</strong><br><strong>Mike Marqusee</strong><br><strong>Seni Seneviratne</strong></p>",
  "<p>It's a fair bet that if the average Briton were asked to name an Australian artist, they would struggle to name anyone beyond Rolf Harris. But that is very much the UK's loss, the Royal Academy believes, as it announces plans to stage the first survey of its kind in this country looking at 200 years of Australian art.</p> <p>\"It is very long overdue,\" said the RA's director of exhibitions, Kathleen Soriano. \"We should know more about these important figures as part of our art historical canon.\"</p> <p>Soriano, who is curating the exhibition, which will open in September next year and be the Royal Academy's big autumn/winter show, said she had wanted to put on a major Australian show for years \u2013 \"ever since I went to Australia in the early 1990s and I couldn't understand why there were so many artists that I'd never heard of\".</p> <p>She agreed that most Britons would not be able to name a single Australian artist. \"People who know about contemporary art might say Shaun Gladwell, but no, I don't think they would.\"</p> <p>\"That doesn't matter,\" said Ron Radford, the director of the National Gallery of Australia. \"A lot of Australians don't know much about British art but they do know a lot about their own art, that's something that's changed in the last 50 years \u2013 Australians are quite passionate about their own art.\"</p> <p>The two galleries are partners on what will be something of a landmark show with over 180 works of art. It will include works by Aboriginal artists such as Rover Thomas Joolama and Fiona Foley; early 19th century European settler landscapes by artists such as John Glover; the more German Romantic inspired work of artists such as Eugene von Gu\u00e9rard from the middle of the century at the time of the gold rush; the Australian impressionists led by Tom Roberts; early Modernists such as Margaret Preston; mid-century Australian superstars Arthur Boyd and Sidney Nolan; right up to internationally recognised contemporary artists such as Gladwell and Tracey Moffatt.</p> <p>There have been few big Australian art shows in the UK. The most significant were an exhibition of Aboriginal art at the Hayward in 1993 and a show of contemporary Australian painting at the Whitechapel in the early 1960s. The last time the RA looked meaningfully at Australian art was 1923.</p> <p>\"I think British audiences might be a little shocked and agreeably surprised at the high quality of the works,\" said Radford. \"So many curators who come from Europe to Australia are just so surprised by the quality, particularly the landscapes.\"</p> <p>He thought eyes would also be opened with the Aboriginal art in the show. \"Britain has been less responsive than Europe, the US or Canada has been to Australian Aboriginal art, I don't quite know why. But people might be pleasantly surprised and I think Britain is very ready for it.\"</p> <p>The story will be told through a theme \u2013 Australia's land and landscape \u2013 and will include paintings, drawings, photographs and multimedia works.</p> <p>Even when early artists were heavily influenced by western art, the work they produced had a real Australian-ness to it, said Soriano, because of the astonishing diversity of light and landscape.</p> <p>There will be significant loans from Australian collections, including arguably Boyd's greatest masterpiece, the enormous and important <a href=\"http://cs.nga.gov.au/Detail.cfm?IRN=74789\" title=\"\">Paintings in the studio: Figure supporting back legs and Interior with black rabbit, from the National Gallery in Canberra</a>. Soriano said Boyd was \"to my mind, one of the stars of Australian painting.\" Another highlight will be Nolan \u2013 \"many see him as the artist who inserted human drama into the Australian landscape\" \u2013 and a 1946 work from his Ned Kelly series.</p> <p>The show will conclude a year that will, in the main galleries, also see the first large scale show anywhere to explore the portraiture of \u00c9douard Manet, the man considered the father of modern art; and the 244th annual Summer Exhibition, the largest open submission contemporary art show that attracted 11,000 entries last year.</p> <p>In the Sackler Wing the RA will stage the first ever UK retrospective for George Bellows, who would probably be regarded as one of the greatest of all American artists, had he not died so early \u2013 aged 42, in 1925, from a case of neglected appendicitis. The show will include his better-known boxing paintings as well as those that reflect his fascination with the people and technology of early 20th century New York.</p> <p>Other shows in the wing will include Mexico: A Revolution in Art, 1910-1940 and a showcase of the work of 19th century French artist Honor\u00e9 Daumier.</p> <p>There will also be a busy programme in 6 Burlington Gardens, the space that used to be the Museum of Mankind and will \u2013 by 2018, the RA expects \u2013 be linked to the main building as part of an ambitious overhaul. The RA also announced plans for a solo exhibition by New York-based artist Mariko Mori and a show devoted to the ideas and work of architect Richard Rogers, coinciding with his 80th birthday.</p>",
  "<p>Lost in Showbiz is pleased to&#xa0;note the wide variety of responses to Hurricane Sandy from America's celebrities. At one extreme, there was hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons, who&#xa0;lambasted Mayor Bloomberg for making insufficient provision for New York's homeless: \"They're fucked, it's terrible.\" At the other there was Nicole \"Coco Marie\" Austin, mammiferous wife of rapper Ice-T, who posted an online video of herself in New Jersey, jiggling her surgically enhanced breasts at the incoming storm.

  "<p>The UK government says an independent Scotland would have to apply as a new member state to join the European Union, with uncertain consequences.</p> <p>In a brief statement issued on Thursday, Westminster hinted strongly that its legal advice directly contradicted the claim by Scotland's first minister, Alex Salmond, that, if Scotland voted for independence, it and the rest of the UK would need to reapply to join the EU as newly formed states.</p> <p>As the controversy over Salmond's stance on Europe again dominated first minister's questions at Holyrood, the UK government said its position was that only Scotland would have to apply to join as a new state if voters chose independence in 2014.</p> <p>Separately, in a speech on Europe to the Royal Institute of International Affairs at Chatham House in London, the deputy prime minister Nick Clegg entered the fray, stating that Salmond's statements on Scotland getting automatic membership of the EU \"has no basis in fact\".</p> <p>He said Scottish nationalists \"don't want to face what might happen to Scotland's influence on fishing quotas, or agricultural policy, or the regulation of the banks. They don't want reality to bite. So they've gone into denial, preferring political assertion to legal advice.\"</p> <p>The dispute has suddenly dominated the debate about the Scottish independence referendum after Salmond's deputy, Nicola Sturgeon, revealed last week that the Scottish National party government had not sought its own legal advice on EU membership, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/23/alex-salmond-eu-legal-advice-scotland\" title=\"\">despite statements by Salmond that it had. </a></p> <p>The UK government statement stressed that, unlike the Scottish government, it had obtained formal advice from its law officers and that Scotland would have to negotiate the terms of its EU membership with the UK and all other 26 member states.</p> <p>It said: \"This government has confirmed it does hold legal advice on this issue. Based on the overwhelming weight of international precedent, it is the government's view that the remainder of the UK would continue to exercise the UK's existing international rights and obligations and Scotland would form a new state.</p> <p>\"The most likely scenario is that the rest of the UK would be recognised as the continuing state and an independent Scotland would have to apply to join the EU as a new state, involving negotiation with the rest of the UK and other member states, the outcome of which cannot be predicted.\"</p> <p>Referring to statements by European commission president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, and his deputy, Viviane Reding, that a newly independent country would be seen as a new applicant, it added: \"Recent pronouncements from the commission support that view.\"</p> <p>It rejected Salmond's suggestion that the UK should take up the commission's offer to provide any member state with a clear view on the membership rights of a newly-formed state within the EU.</p> <p>The commission has recently said that after the deal between Salmond and David Cameron to stage the independence referendum, known as the Edinburgh agreement, it could offer its opinion if a member state provided a detailed and specific scenario.</p> <p>Officials said Salmond had not actually officially asked the UK government to do so, and added that it was the Scottish government's problem, not the UK's.</p> <p>\"The UK government does not obtain its legal advice from the European commission,\" the statement from Westminster said. \"We are clear that we are not pre-negotiating the terms of separation from the UK ahead of the referendum. It is the Scottish government's policy on independence which is causing this uncertainty and they should be prepared to deal with the many questions it raises.\"</p> <p>Salmond was goaded during first minister's questions about the controversy that erupted last week and escalated further after Spain's foreign minister, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Garc\u00eda-Margallo, said an independent Scotland would have to<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/24/scotland-eu-membership-spain\" title=\"\"> \"join the queue\" for EU membership. </a></p> <p>Johann Lamont, the Scottish Labour leader, said the first minister was \"treating the people of Scotland like fools\" and was no longer trusted to tell the truth. \"What is it that he's so scared of, that he can't ask the Bank of England about the pound; he can't ask other EU members about Europe?\" she asked.</p> <p>Salmond retaliated by quoting from an expert on the EU's borders, Graham Avery, a former strategy director at the commission who was made one of a number of honorary directors general of the European commission after he retired.</p> <p>In a submission to the Commons foreign affairs select committee, Avery supported Salmond's position that it was inconceivable that an independent Scotland would be expected to leave the EU and then reapply. Salmond said his opinion \"rather puts the lie to the scaremongering campaign of Labour and their unionist colleagues in the Conservative party\".</p> <p>\"For practical and political reasons, they could not be asked to leave the EU and apply for readmission,\" Avery told the committee. \"Negotiations on the terms of membership would take place in the period between the referendum and the planned date of independence. The EU would adopt a simplified procedure for the negotiations, not the traditional procedure followed for the accession of non-member countries.\"</p> <p>But Avery, now at St Antony's College, Oxford University, directly contradicted Salmond's assertions that an independent Scotland would not be expected to join the euro instead of sterling, and that it would not need to sign up to the Schengen agreement rules on security and immigration.</p> <p>Avery said independence would give Scotland a louder and stronger voice in the EU, but new member states \"are required to accept [the euro and Schengen] on principle\". While Scotland's position was still not clear, Avery warned: \"In accession negotiations with non-member countries, the EU has always strongly resisted other changes or opt-outs from the basic treaties.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 2 November 2012. The original referred to a speech on Europe to the Royal United Services Institute, rather than the Royal Institute of International Affairs, at Chatham House in London. This has been corrected. </p>",
  "<p>Anti-death penalty advocates are gearing up for what they hope will be their most significant victory for a generation, as California enters the final week of campaigning over a ballot initiative that would abolish capital punishment in the state and close the largest death row in the country.</p> <p>The Californian referendum on ending the death sentence is being closely watched across the US as potentially the most important turning point since the US supreme court temporarily banned executions in 1972. A \"yes\" vote for Proposition 34 on 6 November would provide a huge boost to abolitionists and send shock waves through the other 32 states that still hand out the ultimate punishment.</p> <p>California <a href=\"http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/state_by_state\">has by far the highest number of prisoners</a> awaiting execution. It has 724 death row inmates, almost twice as many as the next largest, Texas, with 407.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-poll-death-penalty-20121026,0,7370020.story\">The latest USC Dornsife/ Los Angeles Times poll </a>has supporters of Proposition 34 on 42%, just three points behind those who would keep the death sentence in place. That's within the margin of error, suggesting a statistical tie.</p> <p>The abolition proposal is being backed by several high-profile individuals and organisations, including the conservative Fox News talk show host Bill O'Reilly and most large California news outlets. One of the proponents of the initiative is Jeanne Woodford, former warden of San Quentin prison outside San Francisco which houses California's death row.</p> <p>Woodford told the Guardian that having spent more than 30 years in the state's criminal justice system, she had come to the conclusion that the death penalty was indefensible. \"It is broken and ineffective. It doesn't provide greater public safety or enhance our social morality in any way.\"</p> <p>During her time as warden of San Quentin, she presided over four executions including that of Robert Lee Massie who was put to death in 2001 for two separate murders having \"volunteered\" to die by refusing to pursue any appeals.</p> <p>\"In reality, Massie's execution went ahead because he didn't want to live,\" Woodford said. \"So we were helping him with his suicide \u2013 that's a lot to ask of any public servant, and in any other situation it wouldn't be considered appropriate.\"</p> <p>Woodford added that it was only after she stood down as warden that the full impact of having effectively acted as executioner on four occasions hit her. \"I didn't let it destroy me as I became determined to do something about ending this policy \u2013 if I wasn't working towards something positive it could have eaten away at me.\"</p> <p>Ahead of the vote, the abolition campaign, Yes on 34, has been intensively running <a href=\"http://www.safecalifornia.org/facts/advertisements\">TV and radio adverts across California</a>. The TV advert is narrated by Hollywood actor Martin Sheen and features the story of Franky Carrillo, who spent two decades on death row for a murder he did not commit.</p> <p>The campaign's organisers have been deploying several arguments in the hope of attracting voters to the abolitionist cause. In addition to the moral argument that capital punishment can lead to innocent people such as Carrillo being put on death row, they are pushing a more pragmatic financial line that might appeal in these economically challenging times.</p> <p><a href=\"http://media.lls.edu/documents/Executing_the_Will_of_the_Voters.pdf\">A recent study</a> carried out by a senior judge found that the death sentence costs California an extra $184m a year above and beyond what it would be spending were death row closed and all its inmates transferred to life without parole \u2013 the alternative put forward by Proposition 34. The overall cost of death row to the Californian taxpayer, including the inflated expense of capital trials, heightened security in prison and endless legal challenges and appeals, was put at $4bn since 1978.</p> <p>The savings that could be made by switching to life imprisonment would allow an additional $100m a year to be spent on investigating serious crimes in a state in which a shocking 46% of murders and 56% of rapes go unsolved. Increasing the clear-up rate of those crimes would be a far more effective deterrent, supporters of the proposition argue, than holding people on death row for many years with very little to show for it \u2013 there have been just 13 executions in California since 1967 and the practice has been legally on hold since 2006.</p> <h2>Support of victims. families </h2> <p>As a symbol of how ineffectual California's death row has become, the most probable way for someone to die on death row is now through old age. Since 1978, 84 inmates have died from natural causes or suicide.</p> <p>The other powerful channel through which supporters of Prop 34 hope to garner votes is to highlight the stories of families of victims of murders and rapes who want to see the death sentence abolished. The campaign has assembled some 720 relatives of victims, all of whom believe the death penalty has amplified their grief rather than consoled them.</p> <p>Deldelp Medina is one of them. Her aunt Magali was murdered eight years ago in a frenzied attack. To add to the emotional devastation of the event, the murderer was Manuel Medina, Deldelp's cousin and Magali's only son.</p> <p>Manuel, a schizophrenic, was in the grip of a psychotic bout at the time he killed his mother. Prosecutors in Florida, where Magali was killed attempted to apply the death sentence to Manuel, and it took his family six years to fight the charges and have them dropped; Manuel is now being indefinitely held in a high-security mental hospital.</p> <p>\"The death penalty is emotionally draining for families like mine,\" Deldelp Medina said. \"It consumes you and takes over your life \u2013 there has to be a better alternative where the perpetrators are put on life without parole.\"</p> <p>Woodford said she had watched time and again as the families of victims began by being in favour of their loved one's murderer being executed, but had come over time to see it as a terrible burden. \"This is an unbelievably painful system for families. There's no closure, there's no finality, it goes on for years inflicting so much harm and damage.\"</p> <p>Should California vote yes next week it will become the sixth state in five years to repeal the death penalty. Connecticut abolished the practice in April, joining Illinois, New Jersey, New Mexico and New York.</p>",
  "<p>Barclays was insistent last night that it would defend itself against a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/01/barclay-banking\" title=\"\">potential $470m (\u00a3290m) fine for allegations it attempted to rig electricity prices</a> even as the US regulator making the accusations published embarrassing emails sent by four former traders of the bank.</p> <p>The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which has given Barclays and the four traders 30 days to respond to its allegations, supported its claims with emails and instant messages, written in trader jargon, in which traders boasted they would \"crap on\" prices and how they \"totally fuckked\" (sic) with markets.</p> <p>The allegations shed some light on the complexities of energy trading and single out four locations \u2013 Columbia, Palo Verde, South Path 15 and North Path 15 \u2013 that were said to have been used by the traders to benefit the bank's positions on the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE).</p> <p>In one instant message sent to a colleague, Ryan Smith, wrote \"I totally fuckked (sic) with the Palo mrkt today \u2026 look at my deals on ICE\". As the series of instant messages continued, Smith concluded: \"I just started lifting the piss out of the palo.\"</p> <p>The alleged offences, which the regulator claims caused losses of $139m for rivals and allowed Barclays to make $35m of profit, are said to have taken place between 2006 and 2008 by a team of traders led by Scott Connelly, hired in May 2006, whom the Ferc wants to fine $15m.</p> <p>Smith has been warned of a $1m fine, along with Daniel Brin and Karen Levine who are also facing similar fines. The so-called <a href=\"http://www.ferc.gov/EventCalendar/Files/20121031172428-IN08-8-000.pdf\" title=\"\">show-cause document published by the Ferc </a>shows that the four insist they did nothing wrong.</p> <p>Ferc accuses the four traders, who sat on the so-called west power desk, and Barclays of being involved in a \"co-ordinated scheme\" for 655 days which involved taking losses in one part of the electricity market known as the \"physical\" to move prices in financial contracts linked to the prices of electricity. The Ferc used another message from Brin, in which he explained he is \"doing phys[ical] so i (sic) am trying to drive price in fin[ancial} direction\", to support its claim.</p> <p>Barclays, which was fined a record \u00a3290m for attempting to manipulate the Libor benchmark interest rate, said it \"strongly\" disagreed with allegations. \"We believe that our trading was legitimate and in compliance with applicable law. The [Ferc order] is by its very nature a one-sided document, and does not reflect a balanced and full description of the facts or the applicable legal standard,\" Barclays said.</p> <p>Stressing it had co-operated with the investigation, which began in 2007, the bank's spokesman said: \"We intend to vigorously defend this matter\".</p> <p>Unlike Libor where the penalty was agreed by Barclays in a settlement with three regulators, including the Financial Services Authority in the UK, Barclays may need to take proceedings to court if it is to fend off the penalty proposed by Ferc.</p> <p>The energy regulator included remarks by Joseph Gold, head of commodities for Barclays in the US, who in his evidence to Ferc insisted he had made clear that traders deliberating making losses was unacceptable. \"The golden rule was always, under no circumstances, lose money on a transaction for the intention of making money on another transaction,\" Gold said.</p> <p>The $490m penalty is based on a $435m fine and the disgorgement of the $35m profit the bank is alleged to have made.

Rifle through the blogosphere and you'll find pieces arguing that this or that novel from the Star Wars expanded universe <a href=\"http://www.empireonline.com/features/Future_of_star_wars\" title=\"\">ought to form the basis of Episode VII</a>, that original stars Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher <a href=\"http://www.aintitcool.com/node/59382\" title=\"\">ought to be wheeled out again</a>, and that directors such as Brad Bird, David Yates, Matthew Vaughn, Sam Mendes and JJ Abrams <a href=\"http://collider.com/star-wars-episode-7-directors/207392/\" title=\"\">ought to be top of the producers' wish list</a>.</p> <p>As for the first point, it's now looking likely that we can forget about the introduction of fan favourites such as <a href=\"http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Mara_Jade_Skywalker\" title=\"\">Mara Jade</a>, Jacen Solo and Ben Skywalker from the expanded-universe novels in the new trilogy. Eonline quotes a LucasFilm source suggesting that the <a href=\"http://uk.eonline.com/news/358685/star-wars-7-plot-will-be-an-original-story-says-lucasfilm-source\" title=\"\">next three films will be based on an original story</a>. That's hardly surprising given that George Lucas tends to vacillate about whether the dozens of books that have emerged since 1977 are in any way canonical, occasionally stealing the best bits (such as the name of the Republic's capital city Coruscant from 1991's <a href=\"http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Heir_to_the_Empire\" title=\"\">Heir to the Empire</a>) but usually going his own way.</p> <p>With regard to recasting Hamill, Ford and Fisher (not to mention other favourites such as <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001850/\" title=\"\">Billy Dee Williams</a>), all we know is that Hamill and Fisher were among the first people to be told about the new trilogy, suggesting that they might yet have a role in it. \"Last August, [Lucas] asked Carrie and I to have lunch with him and we did,\" <a href=\"http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/10/31/mark-hamill-star-wars-episode-vii-disney/\" title=\"\">Hamill told Entertainment Weekly</a>. \"I thought he was going to talk about either his retirement or the Star Wars TV series that I've heard about. So when he said: 'We decided we're going to do Episodes VII, VIII and IX,' I was just gobsmacked.\"</p> <p>\"I can see both sides of it,\" added the 61-year-old actor, who is best known these days as a voice artist. \"Because in a way, there was a beginning, a middle and an end and we all lived happily ever after, and that's the way it should be \u2013 and it's great that people have fond memories, if they do have fond memories. But on the other hand, there's this ravenous desire on the part of the true believers to have more and more and more material. It's one of those things: people either just don't care for it or are passionate about it. I guess that defines what cult movies are all about. We'll see. I'm anxious to know what's going on, but the main story was the sale to Disney \u2026 Even now I'm nervous about saying anything. I just don't know!\"</p> <p>As for directors, it doesn't seem that Disney or its now wholly owned division LucasFilm has reached out to anyone just yet. Both will have to tread very carefully because the wrong choice could unleash an angry fan backlash, triggering a torrent of bad publicity for a series that will only recoup the $4.02bn spent by the Mouse House to purchase it if it keeps its audience on side.</p> <p>So where should Disney take Star Wars? Well, here are five suggestions that if heeded might just result in \u2013 at the very least \u2013 a return to respectability.</p> <p>1. Avoid telling a story so panoramic that it stifles the focus on individuals. The original trilogy worked so well because it introduced us to the Star Wars universe via a young man, Luke Skywalker, whose understanding of it was initially not very much more advanced than the viewer's own. Our hero's development from antsy youth to fully fledged Jedi knight over the course of the three films mirrored the audience's increasing immersion into the galaxy of the former Republic: epic and galaxy-spanning as the stories were, we saw them almost entirely from the perspective of Luke and other individuals we knew and cared about.</p> <p>2. Go easy on the CGI. Star Wars borrows heavily from genres such as planetary romance, which are fantastical in the extreme. This makes it vital that realism is injected into the new films wherever possible. The prequel trilogy eschewed this approach by constantly offering widescreen shots of planet surfaces, sometimes flitting back and forth from one system to another in the space of a few minutes. Thanks to the use of pretty but uninvolving CGI, this left the viewer feeling abstracted from the worlds on screen. Who can remember in detail any of the numerous planets depicted in Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones or Revenge of the Sith half as well as Jabba's lair in Return of the Jedi, the cave scene on the ice world of Hoth in The Empire Strikes Back or Yoda's swamp-like Dagobah home in the same film? Sometimes less is more, and Episode VII desperately needs to return us to grimy, mysterious and genuinely threatening locations, rather than ones which look like offcuts from naff computer games.</p> <p>3. Tread carefully before making the new film a direct sequel to Return of the Jedi. Lucas himself has had decades to think about the possibility of bringing a sequel trilogy to the big screen, but as recently as 2008 did not see how it could be done. \"I get asked all the time: 'What happens after Return of the Jedi?' and there really is no answer for that,\" he said during promotion for that year's ill-fated animation <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/125513/star.wars\" title=\"\">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a>, adding: \"The movies were the story of Anakin Skywalker and Luke Skywalker, and when Luke saves the galaxy and redeems his father, that's where that story ends.\"</p> <p>Here's where the return of Hamill, Fisher and Ford might make some sense, but is also risky. A long enough period needs to have elapsed since the events of Return of the Jedi for new threats to have emerged in time to be faced down in Episode VII, and presuming that each actor is cast according to his or her real age, there would be 32 years between the two episodes \u2013 just about long enough. On the other hand, taking the series into an era thousands of years in the past or future would allow the new writers far more room for manoeuvre when it came to imagining the new films. Of course, Disney and LucasFilm might make the best of both worlds by borrowing from Star Trek and introducing time travel into the universe, but Star Wars has been more space opera than sci-fi and such a move could feel incongruous.</p> <p>4. Don't be afraid to kill someone off. If the new film does feature characters from the original Star Wars series, some of them ought to be culled to drive the action along. The weakness of the expanded universe stems largely from Lucas's refusal to allow writers to kill anyone important, resulting in novels that were forced to off the likes of Chewbacca. The original series bade farewell to Yoda, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader himself, each death delivering vital poignancy and pathos. Even the best bits of the prequel trilogy centred on the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW1n360Xm-A\" title=\"\">deaths of Padm\u00e9</a>, Anakin's mum and Qui-Gon Jinn, though all the important characters had to be kept healthy for their appearances in the (canonically) later triptych. Imagine the impact of bringing Hamill back as Luke Skywalker but sending him to sleep with the fishes halfway through Episode VII.</p> <p>5. Whoever they are, be brave and give the new writers and directors freedom to reimagine. The forthcoming sequel trilogy ought to be a plum job for whomever Disney recruits. The appointment of a talented journeyman such as <a href=\"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/david_yates/\" title=\"\">David Yates</a> would probably appease acolytes because he did a decent job on the final films in the Harry Potter series, but Star Wars needs a more visionary creative team if it is to return to peak fitness. <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0190859/\" title=\"\">Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n</a> is a name that no one seems to be mentioning, yet his Potter instalment, The Prisoner of Azkaban, in my view stands as easily the best of the series (not to mention the best genre children's film of recent times). Crucially, the Mexican film-maker managed to deliver a genuinely eery and atmospheric movie that kept viewers of all ages happy and did not threaten the fantasy series' vital cohesiveness.</p> <p>Of the other contenders, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0009190/\" title=\"\">JJ Abrams</a> might bring a touch of Spielbergian awe to the proceedings but would be a controversial choice given his Star Trek connections. <a href=\"http://comicbook.com/blog/2012/10/31/star-wars-by-joss-whedon-some-thoughts/\" title=\"\">Joss Whedon</a> would have to seriously tone down his very adult postmodern pop culture sensibilities, though he would make a brilliant choice to rewrite any flagging dialogue. Brad Bird would be an excellent choice for this kind of material, as anyone who has seen <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0129167/\" title=\"\">The Iron Giant</a> or The Incredibles will attest. Who's top of your wish list?</p> <p>Whichever director takes on the job, Disney and LucasFilm are not going to get the best people on board if they insist on forcing them to work within a pre-existing framework based on Lucas's old ideas. Lucas, still ostensibly on board as \"creative consultant\", has clearly run out of good ideas, and new blood is needed. Let's hope producers make the right choice to deliver a fresh and vital new trilogy which truly deserves the prefix Star Wars in its title, rather than one that finds itself dragged down by the weight of the series' past glories.</p>",
  "<p>The Metropolitan police, one of the most sclerotic institutions in Britain, is at last making strides to join the modern world where money is short and everyone has to shape up or ship out. As well as considering the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/30/scotalnd-yard-sell-met-costs\" title=\"\">sale of New Scotland Yard</a> in central London, which will make a very nice luxury hotel or HQ for a Middle Eastern sovereign wealth fund, and moving to a refurbished terraced house in Peckham, it is also now seeking to attract sponsors, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/nov/01/met-police-corporate-sponsorship-years\" title=\"\">donors supplying an increasing amount of its equipment</a>.</p> <p>There are the usual leftwing critics (Boris Johnson would have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2012/nov/01/boris-johnson-lefty-tossers-video\" title=\"\">a ruder word</a> for them) who carp that this will undermine the independence of the police. But they need to get real. Policing is expensive and our police will know where the red lines have to be drawn to ensure that their view of McDonald's is not influenced by the fact that it is paying for police mountain bikes, or that the policing of matches involving Chelsea or Queens Park Rangers is not affected by the fact those clubs have kindly given the police much-needed football shirts.</p> <p>Scotland Yard robustly defends the donations, saying it has a \"long history\" of working with commercial partners to tackle crime. It's time to move that history along. There is no reason why many aspects of police work shouldn't be paid for by commercial organisations, following the example of UK Payments Administration Ltd, which has donated \u00a311.9m to fund the police's dedicated cheque and plastic crime investigation unit.</p> <p>Let's start thinking creatively about this and get more companies involved. WH Smith could sponsor police notepads and pencils; Dyson could pay for anti-litter units; Yale locks would be an obvious sponsor for police units dealing with burglaries; Virgin could underwrite the Flying Squad; Ann Summers could produce branded handcuffs and truncheons; the Antiques Roadshow could sponsor the art theft unit; Visa and Mastercard will want to compete for the plastic card crime contract; there must be mattress companies that would want to sponsor padded cells (with extra pocket springs); and do Black Marias really have to be black \u2013 why not orange (EasyJail)?</p> <p>New New Scotland Yard, down in Peckham, could itself be sponsored. With the break-up of the UK imminent, Scotland Yard is clearly an inappropriate name. Why not Samsung Yard? And why not brand individual police stations? Instead of Paddington Green, why not Paddington Bear?</p> <p>Police personnel wear drab uniforms and for some bizarre reason walk around with their fingers tucked into their tunics. Why not redesign the uniforms and cover them in stylish logos like Formula One drivers? They will look and feel better about themselves, and their forces will be making some desperately needed dosh.</p> <p>This isn't rocket science. It's simple commercial thinking that will transform the face of the police in this country. As a nation we have become fearful of change and commercialisation, losing out to more innovative countries in Asia and South America which don't have hang-ups about keeping public service and tawdry commerce separate. There are no Chinese walls in China! Unless we wake up, we will be eaten by the Asian tiger and the South American (subs \u2013 please fill in appropriate animal). The police, in embracing the need to find sponsors and reduce their dependence on the state, are showing what is possible. Now for the fire service \u2026 or rather the EDF fire service.</p>",
  "<h2>SUPER CALEY GO BALLISTIC, RANGERS ARE ATROCIOUS, IS THE HEADLINE WE'D DEFINITELY HAVE USED HAD THIS STORY BEEN ABOUT THE LEAGUE CUP IN SCOTLAND AND NOT THE CORRESPONDING TOURNAMENT SOUTH OF THE BORDER</h2> <p>On the face of it, last night wasn't a particularly good one for Liverpool. They had been in proud possession of Tin Pot, the shiny three-handled metal jug which the do-gooders of the Football League charitably loan out each year to the most desperate and needy in society, the idea being that everyone should get the chance to feel special at some point. Sort of like when it was Dribbling Dave's turn to look after the class gerbil at infant school. (He's now PM, proof positive this isn't just wishy-washy liberal nonsense.) But yesterday evening the Football League was forced to confiscate Tin Pot from Liverpool, because they simply hadn't been looking after it properly. Joe Cole had got his head stuck in it, and spent the entire time waddling around blindly, clanking into things in the style of a knock-kneed buffoon. A League mandarin eventually managed to prise Tin Pot off Cole's confused noggin, but not before it had been battered completely out of shape, and covered in drool to boot. Oh Joe! Oh Liverpool! You'll not be seeing Tin Pot again any time soon, we'll be bound!</p> <p>Still, it wasn't all bad news for Liverpudlians, because at Stamford Bridge, secret agent Scott Wootton, with Anfield roots but subsequently planted at Old Trafford, ensured rivals Manchester United won't be in possession of Tin Pot this season either. For Wootton delivered a masterclass in humour, the sort of act that hasn't been caught on film since the imperial phase of Harold Lloyd, one which could only have been more slapstick had he been receiving therapy for motor-skills disorder from Dr J Cole. Wootton spent most of United's tie at Chelsea bowling people over for penalties, gifting possession to the opposition near his own goal, and hanging precariously off the face of a clock, a routine which single-handedly snatched defeat from the jaws of victory for United \u2013 and for which a thermonuclear Sir Alex Ferguson hilariously blamed Nani instead.</p> <p>All good knockabout fun, quite literally in Wootton's case, but the evening was to leave a sour taste \u2013 it's almost as if Carling should still be the tournament sponsor \u2013 when some toolkit in the crowd was spotted supposedly acting like a toolkit. An image published on the internet appeared to show some loser throwing monkey shapes at one of United's players, while breathing heavily through his mouth, though that second bit may not have been a conscious part of the gesture. Chelsea are looking into the matter, as well as investigating a series of objects pelted on to the pitch from the away section. Given what also happened last weekend, it's just as well these two clubs won't be playing each other for a wee while. Chelsea in particular, with Refgate looming over them, really could do with some space to chill out and relax. So, what's next up for them, then? A trip to their old pals in Leeds for the first time in eight-and-a-half years, that's what. Oh Tin Pot! How could you!</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\"This prize is important only if Zlatan wins it. This would prove it to be a fair and independent award.

  "<p>High street retailer Comet is in trouble. Its chief executive Bob Darke has told staff that the troubled electricals retailer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/nov/01/comet-electrical-goods-jobs-risk\" title=\"Comet: more than 6,000 jobs at risk\">will enter administration next week</a>, with Deloitte understood to be waiting in the wings to handle the process for the 240 stores.</p> <p>Shoppers will be concerned that recent purchases might not be delivered. If you have a gift card \u2013 Comet sells them in amounts of up to \u00a3500 \u2013 you may be equally worried you won't be able to redeem it.</p> <p>So how can you shop confidently on the high street knowing you won't end up out of pocket if something goes wrong?</p> <h2>Can I still shop in Comet?</h2> <p>Stores are still open, but the website is no longer taking orders, instead redirecting shoppers to a screen which says \"comet.co.uk is currently unavailable\". If you have vouchers, you would be well-advised to use them now, as in some previous cases retailers have refused to accept them once the administrators are brought in.</p> <p>If you are concerned about spending money in the stores, see below for details of how to protect yourself against future problems.</p> <h2>Can I still shop in a store that has gone into administration?</h2> <p>In some cases you can \u2013 and there are often deals to be had as a retailer desperately tries to get rid of its stock to raise as much cash as possible \u2013 but you might not get your money back if an item later turns out to be faulty.</p> <h2>I'm awaiting delivery of an item I've paid for \u2013 will I get it?</h2> <p>Contact the retailer to see what stage your order is at \u2013 if it's ready for dispatch the company might still be able to fulfil it. If it cannot dispatch an item check to see if you can collect it from a warehouse or store yourself, providing there are still staff on hand to help. You'll need to take a receipt or proof of ID with you.</p> <h2>What if it doesn't arrive or turns out to be faulty?</h2> <p>If the company is unable to fulfil your order and you are unable to obtain a refund or replacement for a faulty item, you may be able to get your money back depending on how you paid:</p> <p><strong>If you paid by credit card </strong>You are covered by Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. This makes the credit provider jointly liable with the retailer for anything you buy, provided the item costs between \u00a3100 and \u00a330,000. This also applies to anything bought with a credit agreement through a store, so if you sign up for an interest-free credit deal you are still covered.</p> <p>The protection covers undelivered goods and those that prove to be faulty, and you only need to have put the deposit on your card, not the whole cost.</p> <p>Should you need to make a claim, Citizens Advice has a <a href=\"http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/england/consumer_credit_act_1974_-_section_75\" title=\"Citizens Advice: Letter making a claim for equal liability from your credit provider\">template letter</a> you can download and send to your credit card provider. Bear in mind, the cover does not extend to items paid for with credit card cheques.</p> <p><strong>If you bought goods on other plastic </strong>You may have some protection. Visa, MasterCard and American Express all offer a scheme called chargeback, which allows customers to claim back money spent on a debit or prepaid card if the goods do not arrive or are faulty, or where the retailer has gone bust. There are time limits for these claims, so you should act as soon as you can. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/jan/20/section-75-chargeback\" title=\"Section 75 and Chargeback factsheet\">See our factsheet for more on Section 75 and chargeback</a>.</p> <p><strong>If you paid by cash or some other means </strong>You will have to contact the administrators to make a claim directly. Details of who it is are usually posted on the ailing firm's website or should be listed at <a href=\"http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/index.shtml\" title=\"Companies House website\">Companies House</a> or the <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/insolvency/personal-insolvency/individual-insolvency-register\" title=\"Individual Insolvency Register website\">Individual Insolvency Register</a> for sole traders or partnerships.</p> <p>You should do so immediately to inform it about the disputed purchase, although there is no guarantee you will get your money back. A company in administration will have a long list of creditors and it is the administrator's role to decide how much cash the company has to be distributed, which creditors are first in line, and how much each creditor will receive.</p> <h2>Are all gift vouchers worthless if a company is in administration?</h2> <p>Pretty much. It makes sense to try to spend a voucher as soon as you can once you learn a retailer is in trouble, as vouchers tend not to be accepted once a company is in administration. If you have unspent vouchers you need to lodge a claim with the administrators and hope for the best.</p> <h2>I bought vouchers using a credit card. Am I protected?</h2> <p>Section 75 means that buying with a credit card usually offers you protection when a company goes bust, assuming you have spent more than \u00a3100. But the situation with vouchers is more complicated.</p> <p>If there is no third party involved then you could be effective in making a claim. So, if you buy vouchers directly from a store to spend in that store you would be entitled to your money back if that store went bust (remember, this only applies if you've spent more than \u00a3100 using your credit card). However, if you used a third party such as a website that sells vouchers on behalf of a number of stores, you could not make a claim.</p> <p>Check out our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/jan/20/section-75-chargeback\" title=\"Section 75 and Chargeback factsheet\">factsheet on using Section 75 and the Chargeback facility</a> for more information.</p> <h2>Will the guarantee I bought with my product still work?</h2> <p>Yes. Manufacturers often provide their own guarantee, while longer-term guarantees and warranties are usually underwritten by a third party, which will be legally required to honour contracts regardless of what has happened to the retailer who originally sold the product.

  "<p>Barack Obama is due to campaign in Boulder, Colorado on Thursday night to fire up this liberal bastion and try to snuff out a libertarian challenge which threatens to siphon crucial votes.</p> <p>The president hopes to shore up support in the swing state and neutralise Gary Johnson, who is<a href=\"http://www.lp.org/\"> running for president on the Libertarian party ticket</a>, just days ago after the former New Mexico governor electrified students at the University of Colorado in Boulder.</p> <p>The maverick Johnson remains barely known to most ordinary Americans but is expected to take votes from Obama \u2013 and Mitt Romney \u2013 in Colorado on the back of enthusiasm for a separate vote on November 6 over whether to legalise marijuana.</p> <p>Hundreds packed a university auditorium to hear him speak on Monday night. Dozens who did not fit inside lined the corridors, ears straining to catch the words. All cheered and whooped Johnson's calls for social tolerance and a radically downsized government.</p> <p>\"There's a lot of support for my message here. You can feel it,\" he told the Guardian afterwards. \"Young people who are disappointed with the president are listening to what I have to say.\"</p> <p>Some Democrats, haunted by Ralph Nader's torpedoing of Al Gore in 2000, fear Johnson may damage Obama more than Romney and hand the state, and the White House, to the Republicans.</p> <p>Polls have locked the president and Romney in a statistical tie, with one this week giving each candidate 47% each. A few thousand or even just a few hundred votes could swing the state.</p> <p>\"I want you to make sure you sign, seal and deliver this election to Barack Obama,\" Bill Clinton told a rally in Denver on Tuesday night. The outcome could pivot on a handful of votes in Colorado, he said.</p> <p>No one doubts Obama will sweep Boulder and Colorado's other liberal strongholds but the question is: will the margin be enough to offset Romney's advantage in conservative parts of Colorado Springs and the Denver suburbs?</p> <p>Johnson has declared a target of 5%, saying this would wake up Washington to the libertarian message, but in such a tight race analysts say even 0.5% could prove decisive.</p> <p>The lack of detailed polling on Johnson has made Republicans and Democrats equally nervous because he could plausibly sink Romney or Obama.</p> <p>\"The few surveys that have captured his level of support show that he draws from both candidates \u2013 the young people from Obama and he draws the Libertarians from Romney and those who may have been for Ron Paul,\" Floyd Ciruli, a Denver-based pollster, <a href=\"http://www.coloradodaily.com/ci_21869950/pollsters-pro-pot-libertarian-gary-johnson-could-hurt?\">told DailyCamera.com</a>. \"But none of the samples have been big enough to show which candidate loses more votes.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/politics/ci_21900420/libertarian-gary-johnsons-impact-colorado-likely-negligible\">Two Denver Post polls</a> showed Johnson drawing less than 3% and not changing the margins between Obama and Romney. A poll from Public Policy Polling gave Johnson 2% and said he drew slightly more support from Obama than Romney, but not enough to make a difference.</p> <p>For Obama to invest precious, dwindling time in Boulder \u2013 his third visit of the campaign \u2013 underlined concern about Johnson.</p> <p>\"I need your help to put out a spark before it grows into a fire,\" Dan Gould, chair of the Boulder county Democratic party, <a href=\"http://us2.campaign-archive1.com/?u=9ed672e753a99f3b05ab1674b&amp;id=7d2a596f56\">emailed activists before Johnson's visit</a> on Monday.</p> <p>\"He is trying hard to peel student votes away from President Obama around the issue of deregulation of marijuana. With Colorado being so vital and so close at this point, we can't let that happen.\"</p> <p>Democrats handed out flyers near the auditorium and, judging from the pro-Obama slant of several questioners, joined the audience, but there was no dampening Johnson's spark.</p> <p>A youthful 60, wearing a black jacket over a CND T-shirt, Johnson bounded onto the platform and started with a brief resum\u00e9 of his life: entrepreneur, elected governor of New Mexico as a Republican in 1994, re-elected in 1998, vetoed apparently more bills than the country's 49 other governors combined, competed in Iron Man triathlons, climbed Mount Everest. And now running for the White House with slogans such as \"I'm free\" and \"The people's president.\"</p> <p>Government, he said, should keep costs low and stay out of the bedroom. \"You know you're a libertarian when you hate speed limits,\" he said, earning cheers.</p> <p>He promised to end the drug war by legalising marijuana as a first step to legalising other drugs. Colorado's amendment 64, which would allow anyone over 21 to use marijuana, could set an example for America and the world, he said, louder cheers.</p> <p>He advocated non-interventionism overseas. \"I'm the only candidate that doesn't want to bomb Iran. And that wants to pull our troops out of Afghanistan tomorrow.\"</p> <p>Johnson condemned the Patriot Act and the National Defense Authorization act as civil rights violations and called Obama a feeble advocate of gay rights and other liberal causes. \"I agree with everything he says. He was the great hope. But none of it has transpired.\"</p> <p>Johnson also said he would abolish the federal reserve, the department of education, the IRS, income tax and corporate tax. A smaller government and a federal consumption tax would tame the deficit.</p> <p>\"Some say a vote for me is wasting your vote. Wasting your vote is voting for someone you don't believe in. So I say waste your vote, vote for Gary Johnson. If everyone does that, I'll be the next president of the United States.\" A standing ovation followed.</p> <p>Questioners who challenged his hostility to Medicare and student loans \u2013 supposedly a Democrat trump card here \u2013 gained little support from the audience.</p> <p>Johnson, who is on the ballot in 48 states, told the Guardian he had smoked pot but gave it up, along with alcohol, when he became an athlete. He said he appeared to be drawing more support from Obama than Romney in Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada, and vice versa in Michigan and Virginia.</p> <p>Jack Dille, 21, a humanities major, endorsed Johnson. \"Romney and Obama are like milquetoast, just boring. And think of the drug war, it's ridiculous. People say I'm wasting my vote, but if I can't be idealistic now, when can I be?\"</p> <p>Dille is lost to Obama, but the president's return to Boulder may sway undecideds like Kevin Blair, 28, an international affairs student who disapproves of both Romney and Obama. \"Our drone strikes are killing civilians, it's appalling. I'm leaning towards Obama but it sucks that we're stuck with these two schmucks.\"</p>",
  "<p>Shell has warned that the global economy is weakening \"just about everywhere\" as it reported a 6% fall in third quarter profits.</p> <p>The oil and gas group's chief financial officer, Simon Henry, said business and consumer demand was weak \"across the board\" in Europe, with the consumer retrenching in north America as well \u2013 although the industrial sector has performed more strongly in recent months. Shell said net adjusted profits fell 6% to $6.6bn, reflecting lower gas and oil prices. Shell's average third quarter gas price in the Americas fell by 38% against last year, while the Brent crude oil price has slipped 3.5% over the same period to $109.50 per barrel.</p> <p>Asked by reporters about demand weakness in the global economy, Henry said: \"In the last couple of quarters it is just about everywhere. European demand, specifically consumer and commercial industrial demand, is pretty weak across the board and there are few signs of recovery.\" Referring to north America, he said there was \"stronger commercial industrial demand\" but the consumer and retail market was \"relatively weak\". Some emerging markets, such as Brazil, Turkey and Poland, are performing well, said Henry, with China \"recovering\" after some weak quarters.</p> <p>Analysts said the quarterly production average of just below 3m barrels a day \u2013 from fields in areas such as the Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea and Nigeria \u2013 indicated softening demand. \"Volumes are actually quite weak, below 3m barrels a day for the first time in three years in what's supposed to be a growth year,\" said Royal Bank of Canada analyst Peter Hutton.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/30/bp-beats-forecasts-5bn-profit-dividend\" title=\"\">As with BP earlier this week</a>, Shell said its downstream business \u2013 which refines oil products \u2013 had benefited from shortage of supply from Venezuela and the US, which pushed up refining margins. Henry warned, however, that refining remains under pressure. \"We are seeing a weak economy all around us,\" said Henry. \"So the downstream rally could be short-lived.\" In an indication of the long-term pressures facing an over-supplied refining industry, a Shell-backed consortium agreed this year to buy the Coryton refinery in Essex and convert it into a fuel import terminal.\"</p>",
  "<h2>3.45pm Epsom mulling Emily Davison anniversary</h2> <p>Further to the letter that appeared in yesterday's Guardian (see below), I'm told that Epsom have, for some time, been considering how best to mark the 100th anniversary of Emily Davison's death at the course in June 1913. Nothing has yet been decided but course officials hope to make an announcement nearer the time.</p> <p>It's a very difficult subject for any racecourse to approach. Davison's act has great societal significance as the most remembered act of protest on the route to women getting the vote. She gave her life to that cause and her memory is revered by many.</p> <p>At the same time, no racecourse dares risk being seen to condone people stepping out in front of a horse race, risking not just their own life, but those of the jockeys and horses as well.</p> <h2>2.35pm A wee Frankel montage</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4fJGldv-8Jw?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4fJGldv-8Jw?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Some BBC shots of the great horse on his last day out at Ascot.</p> <h2>1.45pm Chasing Amy</h2> <p>Here's the latest standings in the apprentice title race, which promises to be interesting during the last 10 days of the Flat season:</p> <p>Amy <strong>Ryan</strong> 40<br>Darren <strong>Egan</strong> 38 (injured, out for season)<br>Raul<strong> Da Silva</strong> 33<br>Sean <strong>Levey</strong> 32</p> <p>As we've discussed before, Da Silva isn't getting enough rides to make a late charge, but Levey really is. He had a winner for Ed McMahon at Kempton last night and has nine rides today at Lingfield and Kempton. None of them are strongly fancied, though I do think he may well win the last at Kempton on Kai (8.10).</p> <p>Tomorrow, Levey will put in another double shift with four at Newmarket and two at Wolverhampton. They include Ninjago for his boss, Richard Hannon, who is likely to be a strong favourite. </p> <p>Ryan, meanwhile, has one ride today and three tomorrow. Can she hang on?</p> <h2>1.35pm McCoy hits 100, departs at speed </h2> <p>Tony McCoy has just hacked up at Hereford on Vasco Du Ronceray, a 5s-on shot who became the jockey's 100th winner of the season. McCoy will now be driven to Stratford, where he hopes to ride I'm The Decider (3.10) and Twirling Magnet (3.40).</p> <h2>Today's best bets, by Chris Cook<br></h2> <p>In all the kerfuffle about Kauto Star yesterday, one item that may have been overlooked by racing fans is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/30/derby-day-tribute-suffragettes\" title=\"Letter to the Guardian\">the letter that appeared in the Guardian, calling for a minute's silence before next year's Derby</a> on the 100th anniversary of the death of Emily Davison, a suffragette who ran onto the course during the Derby and was fatally injured in a collision with the king's horse, Anmer. The letter was signed by all sorts of notable folk and the online version includes a link to a petition where you can show your support.</p> <p>I've asked Epsom for a response and I'll let you know if they say anything on the subject.</p> <p>On the subject of things that might be overlooked, today's racing starts with a Group One at 1.50pm, when Saint-Cloud stages its Criterium International, won in the past three years by French Fifteen, Roderic O'Connor and Jan Vermeer. That's a Guineas runner-up, an Irish Guineas winner and the horse who started favourite for the Derby.</p> <p>Aidan O'Brien has won it four times in seven years but is unrepresented this time. Ireland has a live runner, though, in Jim Bolger's <strong>Loch Garman (1.50)</strong>, who made his racecourse debut at Navan last week and won impressively. He beat Indian Chief, the O'Brien-trained 4-5 favourite for a race the Ballydoyle trainer had won every year since 2004. Indian Chief is a Derby entrant who cost 360,000 guineas at Tattersalls last year.</p> <p>Normally the step up from maiden company to a Group One would be difficult but Loch Garman has conditions to suit and the reality is that he may not have to improve much to win this six-runner affair. Obviously, you'd have to respect Triple Threat, an improver from Andre Fabre's yard, as well as US Law, who is proven in the conditions. Still, I make Loch Garman a bet at the 6-1 with Hill's.</p> <p>Bolger's comments in today's Racing Post are rather non-committal but he describes the horse as \"very well\".</p> <p>It's good to soft, soft in places at Hereford after 8mm of overnight rain, with more due this morning. That should be soft enough for <strong>Pericoloso (2.30)</strong> in the staying handicap hurdle, for which he's only 4lb higher than when slogging home at Exeter the other week. He won a similar race as a novice in the spring, when Ludlow's going was also soggy, but lacked the pace for good going at Aintree in between. He's fairly priced at 9-4.</p> <p>Still, Hereford has often seemed to be the home of well-backed winners with poor recent form and I'm beginning to think I may not miss it. Kempton may offer better betting opportunities today, despite the need for a modicum of luck around those tight turns.</p> <p>Roger Charlton may land both divisions of the maiden race that open the card there this evening.<strong> Serenity Spa (4.40) </strong>was an eye-catcher in an Ascot maiden in July, the winner having been fourth in the Listed Dick Poole on her only start since. Serenity Spa has been given time to come to herself, seems unlikely to meet any champions here and is 11-4.</p> <p><strong>Tartary (5.10) </strong>was only sixth on his debut over this course and distance recently but was green before staying on takingly at the end. He's 5-1 because the market likes Sky Garden, but that one has looked a bit one-paced in three turf starts and makes her all-weather debut.</p> <p>The mile handicap is competitive but I can't see why <strong>Shamir (7.10)</strong> should be 16-1, having won four times over the course and distance, including last time out. Yes, he has a wide draw but it's not as though he has to lead. In fact, his first win here was from stall 14.</p> <p>Finally, I couldn't quite bring myself to tip Godsmejudge, who makes his chasing debut at Stratford. I shall, however, be looking out for an opportunity to put him in a double with Ponmeoath.</p> <h2>Paddy Power tipping competition, day four<br></h2> <p><strong>TL127</strong> was the big mover on day three, picking both Bladewood Girl (5-1) and Ouzinkie (5-1). <strong>Captainconan</strong> had Bladewood Girl and San Telm (7-2). Both still have a way to go to catch <strong>Copshaw</strong>, who continued his good run with Bladewood Girl.</p> <p>Today, we'd like your tips, please, for these races: <strong>3.10 Stratford</strong>,<strong> 3.20 Lingfield</strong>, <strong>6.10 Kempton</strong>.</p> <p>This week's prize, generously offered by the bookmaker Paddy Power, is <strong>a pair of tickets to Cheltenham</strong> for <strong>all three days of next month's meeting</strong>, which they sponsor. That's Friday 16th, Saturday 17th and Sunday 18th November, with the highlight of the meeting being <strong>the Paddy Power Gold Cup</strong>.</p> <p>As ever, our champion will be the tipster who returns the best profit to notional level stakes of \u00a31 at starting price on our nominated races, of which there will be four each day up until Friday.

  "<p>The story of Morgan Odhiambo, a refugee who chose Britain as a place of sanctuary, is sadly typical. </p> <p>In his native Kenya he suffered from corruption and brutality. After his car was stolen he suspected that police, after recovering it, made money by selling it on.</p> <p>When he challenged them about their fraudulent practices he was beaten and received threats that scared him enough to flee.</p> <p>Like many people who live in countries once colonised by the British, and who become victims of corrupt political systems where the rule of law does not pertain, he decided to come to Britain.</p> <p>He arrived here in 2003 and immediately ran into rampant prejudice against people collectively known as \"asylum seekers.\"</p> <p>Despite the fact that many British people were kind and welcoming, he ran up against plenty of scorn. Why? Gradually, he became convinced that it was due to negative press coverage. He says:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"People get their view from the newspapers. People look at you like you're a scrounger. They think you're just 'one of them'. They think you're just here to take their money or their job. They just don't know the truth.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Depressed by the hostility, he was also frustrated during a long battle to win asylum. A major turning point came in 2009 when he contacted the Red Cross and with its help, he finally became a British citizen in 2011. </p> <p>Now Morgan, a 40-year-old computing student who is married with five children, is living happily near Milton Keynes. But he wishes his experience on arriving in Britain had been different and believe better, more sympathetic reporting by newspapers about the reality of life as a refugee, would have helped. </p> <p>\"The answer is to educate people so they know most asylum seekers are genuine and not really bad,\" he says. </p> <h2>Call for action by the Red Cross</h2> <p>Morgan's story is one of many that the Red Cross has heard during its years of helping asylum seekers and refugees, convincing the charity that fresh media guidance is necessary. </p> <p>It is \"gravely concerned\" about negative reporting on asylum seekers that ignores <a href=\"http://www.pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=OTE=\">guidance circulated to editors by the Press Complaints Commission</a> in October 2003, which addressed inaccurate reporting about all refugees.</p> <p>The Red Cross cites an independent survey - carried out by YouGov* - which shows that 72% of the UK public believe newspaper reporting about asylum seekers and refugees is negative.<br> The survey also found that the words people most associate with media coverage of refugees and asylum seekers are \"illegal immigrants\" (65%) and \"scroungers\" (28%). </p> <p>Now the charity is calling for fairer, and more accurate, press treatment of people who seek sanctuary in Britain.</p> <p>To that end, it has issued a set of demands for the new press regulator to take on board:</p> <p><strong>Stop</strong> irrelevant references to immigration status appearing in negative stories about individuals;</p> <p><strong>Give</strong> the Red Cross and others the chance to speak up in defence of refugees and asylum seekers;</p> <p><strong>Monitor</strong> standards of reporting pro-actively instead of waiting for individual complaints;</p> <p><strong>Crack down</strong> on inaccurate uses of terms such as \"bogus\" and \"illegal\" when mentioning asylum seekers.</p> <p>I thought we had sorted out that last problem ages ago, but here's a Times headline published in June last year, <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article3064981.ece\">DNA test for bogus refugees scrapped as expensive flop</a>.

  "<p>Britain's largest police force has received millions of pounds in corporate sponsorship over the past five years, a freedom of information request has revealed.</p> <p>Totalling almost \u00a323m, gifts given to the Metropolitan police force by businesses include everything from Chelsea and QPR T-shirts to vehicles supplied to royal protection and special branch units by Land Rover and BMW.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20156574\" title=\"\">The request</a> also shows that many local businesses across the force's boroughs were donating patrol mountain bikes to help police their areas.</p> <p>The figure unearthed by the BBC also includes money donated by companies for dedicated policing at events. For decades, forces around the country have charged to police events such as football matches. However, the freedom of information request also reveals that <a href=\"http://www.bossuk.org/\" title=\"\">representatives of the oil industry</a> paid to have an officer reduce crime on their retail forecourts.</p> <p>The credit card body the Association of Payment Clearing Services paid a total of \u00a311.9m to fund its own dedicated fraud investigation unit called the dedicated cheque and plastic crime unit.</p> <p>In all, between April 2007 and March 2012 the Met received a minimum of 833 payments equalling \u00a322.7m.</p> <p>In a statement the Met said: \"Donations and sponsorship over \u00a350,000 must be referred to the deputy mayor for policing and crime for approval.</p> <p>\"Such arrangements are subject to rigorous parameters. They do not make any of the statutory functions of the MPS [Metropolitan police service] dependent on this funding nor does it allow for any companies to interfere with the duties of the police.\"</p> <p>Speaking to the Today programme, the Green party London assembly member Jenny Jones said she feared rent-a-cop policing. \"There's not enough detail. It would be very interesting to ask the Met to give a little more information because some of this looks like rent-a-cop policing, which I think the majority of the public would not find acceptable,\" she said.</p> <p>The former chief constable of Gloucestershire police Dr Tim Brain said: \"I think there's no problem with it. It is allowed by law.\" He added that \u00a322m over five years should be seen in the context of the Met's overall budget of around \u00a33.5bn annually.</p> <p>In a statement to the BBC, Keith Vaz, the Commons home affairs committee chairman, said the Metropolitan police should \"consider very carefully\" whether any gifts \"could be perceived as compromising the force's position\".</p> <p>He added: \"The home affairs committee is currently holding an inquiry into leadership and standards in the police, and we will be hearing from the commissioner on these matters.\"</p>",
