  "<p>For anyone who doubts the therapeutic effects of the internet, I can recommend the Twitter feed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TTPMO\" title=\"\">@ThingsThatPissMeOff</a>. It made me realise that I am not alone in spending so much of my life being pissed off. True, a lot of the things that piss off the tweeters don't piss me off at all. \"Not being texted back\", for instance, or \"not respecting God\". But \"being interrupted when you're trying to say something important\" is right up there, along with \"forgetting what you were doing\".</p> <p>The story of family life is the story of how you manage the way you piss each other off. I have a greater range of techniques to annoy than anyone else in my family, and I consider this one of my few genuine achievements as a father.</p> <p>I don't listen. I try to steal the food off other's plates. I do things with bad grace. I don't respect the recycling bins. I am surly with waitresses. I make excuses. I lose things \u2013 sometimes other people's things \u2013 then incessantly ask where they are, or blame other people for losing them.</p> <p>I knock things over. I won't relinquish the TV control. I leave a trail of detritus behind me as I make my way around the house, consisting of food remnants and dirty clothes. I repeat myself unnecessarily. I start tasks without finishing them. I don't put the loo seat up when I'm peeing. I repeat myself unnecessarily.</p> <p>So much for the mea culpas. This is what really pisses me off about my family, children first. Tantrums. Disobedience. A child's assumption that they are living in a five-star hotel in which their parents are menials. Telling tales \u2013 especially about me, to my wife. The insistence on fanatically, meaningless equality between siblings, as in \"her Nobbly Bobbly ice lolly has got better coloured bobbles than mine\". Pointless resistance to the inevitable, such as refusing to go to bed unless threatened. A permanently livid sense of injustice.</p> <p>I could continue but it isn't really the point. The real point of this column is to say what annoys me about my wife, because I can never get it all out in real life without her interrupting me, which is very much one of the things that pisses me off about her.</p> <p>What pisses me off about my wife is that she is more often right than me, and she doesn't have the good grace to conceal the fact. She only remembers what she want to, and claims that I do the same thing, which is clearly absurd, because I know I only remember what is true.</p> <p>She pisses me off when she tweets while watching TV programmes and the programmes she watches piss me off even more \u2013 what is a PhD in literature doing watching Celebrity Big Brother, Masterchef, and The Apprentice? She pisses me off when, with her lit crit hat on, she informs me that \"the author is dead\", when I'm not, and it pisses me off that she claims to know more about Shakespeare than me just because she happens to teach it.</p> <p>I could continue. In fact, why don't I? She pisses me off when I show her one of these columns in advance and, as a matter of routine, she informs me that it's \"a bit desperate\" or \"rather shallow\", and it pisses me off even more when she's right. It pisses me off when I try to cook something and she stands over me to make sure I don't make any mistakes, therefore ensuring I make mistakes all the time.</p> <p>Most of all, it pisses me off that however much she pisses me off, I still can't help loving her. The same goes for my children, and life itself, because life is not the proverbial bowl of cherries. Life is being pissed off. All a good life really amounts to is not minding that much.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Follow Tim on Twitter </em><a href=\"http://es.twitter.com/timlottwriter\" title=\"\"><em>@timlottwriter</em></a></p>",
  "<p>We've lived where we do for more than five years now, but don't really know anybody round here. Well, we didn't until recently; then a couple of things changed that. First we had ourselves a baby, and suddenly we knew half the street. Then I got a Renault Twizy for the weekend, and suddenly we knew the other half.</p> <p>I think I've made more friends through the Twizy in a couple of days than I have with the baby in six months. It's like one of those tests magazines sometimes do \u2013 what's a&#xa0;better pulling tool, a baby, a puppy or a Twizy? I'm not sure about actually pulling (and anyway, I'm not interested obviously, being very happy with the mother of the baby), but a Twizy is a good ice-breaker.</p> <p>Everyone wants to stop and chat. What the bloody hell is that, they want to know \u2013 a vacuum cleaner, a&#xa0;printer cartridge, a roller skate, <a href=\"http://www.wenlock-mandeville.com/\" title=\"\">Wenlock</a>? (From behind, it does look&#xa0;a bit like Wenlock, or possibly Mandeville.)</p> <p>What it is is Renault's new urban electric vehicle, with room for two (the passenger goes behind), a range of about 60 miles and a top speed of 50mph. You can't really call it a car \u2013 it doesn't have windows, and even the doors are optional. It's a go-kart, basically, with a roof. It's a bit like a&#xa0;go-kart to drive, too, quick around the corners and fun, if a bit firm on the bumps. Ow!</p> <p>I make more new friends on the road. As a famous motoring journalist, I've driven a lot of fancy cars, but none has created a stir like this. It's like being a celebrity. And the response is almost universally positive. It's like being a celebrity people actually like. It's like being <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/clare-balding\" title=\"\">Clare Balding</a>, I imagine.</p> <p>There are problems; the usual ones associated with electric vehicles. If you don't have off-street parking \u2013 as most people don't in cities, where these cars belong \u2013 you can't charge them at home. I can't charge at work, either, so I'd have to go somewhere else, and sit around for three and a half hours while it charges up. Which is clearly useless. I can't even figure out where these places are, because the map of charge places I download is also useless. Suddenly the lovable Twizy is looking like an expensive toy.</p> <p>There's another problem. It starts to rain, proper British rain. It's not so bad for me up front, but 'er indoors (well, outdoors) in the back, trying to balance two shopping bags on her knee, is getting soaked. The omission of windows is starting to look like an error. Fine on the Promenade des Anglais in Nice maybe, not fine in Angleterre. And it's not even winter. Luckily, we left the baby with one of our new friends.</p> <h2>Renault Twizy</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396338362\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/18/1347984544989/Renault-Twizy-detail-001.jpg\" alt=\"Renault Twizy detail\" width=\"120\" height=\"150\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Renault Twizy detail Photograph: Simon Stuart-Miller for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Stuart-Miller for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Price </strong>From \u00a36,690<br><strong>Top speed</strong> 50mph<br><strong>Acceleration, 0-60mph </strong>No<br><strong>Range</strong> 60 miles<br><strong>CO2 emissions</strong> 0<br><strong>Green rating</strong> 9/10 <br><strong>Cool rating</strong> 9/10 <br><strong>Practicality rating</strong> 2/10</p>",
  "<p>In a hotel beside a Norwegian fjord, encircled by snow-streaked mountains, the novelist and playwright <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuruddin_Farah\" title=\"\">Nuruddin Farah</a> has his mind on warmer waters.\"Are they pirates?\" he says of the Somalis who hold ships hostage off the Horn of Africa, where he was born. \"What they do has the characteristics of piracy. But that wasn't how it started.\" He fixes his eye on the Arctic trawlers in the harbour. \"The majority were fishermen who lost their livelihoods to Korean and Japanese and European fishing vessels, fishing illegally in Somali waters. I'm not condoning the things they're doing. But there are unanswered questions. Someone is not telling us the truth.\"</p> <p>Over 45 years, Farah has pursued complex, elusive truths as one of Africa's greatest novelists, and a cosmopolitan voice in English-language fiction. He was driven into exile by the Somali dictator <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-mohamed-said-barre-1566452.html\" title=\"\">Mohamed Siad Barre</a>, who ruled from 1969 to 1991, and he now lives in Cape Town. But all 11 of his novels (translated into 20 languages) are set in Somali-speaking lands, one impulse being to \"keep my country alive by writing about it\". When I first met him in London in the 1980s, he was with Salman Rushdie at a Royal Court play, and his became a staunch Muslim voice against the fatwa. Rushdie writes in his new memoir of seeking his friend's advice on how to depict a country lost to him: \"'I keep it here,' Nuruddin said, pointing to his heart.\"</p> <p>For Nadine Gordimer, Farah is one of the continent's \"real interpreters\". Aged 66, he has lived in 10 African countries and is often cited by other African writers as overdue for the Nobel. His novels scourge received opinion \u2013 whether of female inferiority (he writes women characters who make their own destinies), religious dogma, nationalism (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Maps-Nuruddin-Farah/dp/0140296433\" title=\"\"><em>Maps</em></a>), foreign aid (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=gifts+nuruddin+farah&amp;tag=googhydr-21&amp;index=aps&amp;hvadid=9682614392&amp;hvpos=1t1&amp;hvexid=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=1145084661748327081&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;ref=pd_sl_18e0wod9c8_e\" title=\"\"><em>Gifts</em></a>) or clannism (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Secrets-Nuruddin-Farah/dp/0140280456/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347633498&amp;sr=8-1\" title=\"\"><em>Secrets</em></a>). They trace the history of a region long an arena for proxy wars and great power rivalries, in an oblique, metaphorical style that marries proverbial wisdom (\"a dead man's shoes are more useful than he is\") with daily life in a modern African state awash with sim cards and AK47s.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/11/books/review/crossbones-by-nuruddin-farah-book-review.html\" title=\"\"><em>Crossbones</em></a> is the final volume of a trilogy, <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/series/82898-past-imperfect\" title=\"\">Past Imperfect</a>, set in the civil war that erupted when Siad Barre was ousted. In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/apr/16/featuresreviews.guardianreview9\" title=\"\"><em>Links</em></a> (2004) a Dante scholar returns to the seaside capital Mogadishu to find StrongmanNorth and StrongmanSouth battling with US Marines in the infernal, Italianate ruins. In <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/08/books/review/deBellaigue.t.html\" title=\"\"><em>Knots</em></a> (2007) a Canadian-Somali actress arrives as the warlords have been vanquished by bearded men in white robes, foisting \"body tents\" on women. By <em>Crossbones</em>, the ascendant Islamists \u2013 whom Farah terms \"religionists\" \u2013 are spoiling for war with Ethiopia, while piracy proliferates off the breakaway coastal region of Puntland.</p> <p>I spoke to Farah as a peace process was under way in Somalia that culminated in the inauguration last Sunday of the country's first elected president in decades. The author was in Troms\u00f8, a tranquil town of clapboard houses and silver birch trees 360km north of the Arctic Circle,&#xa0;to address global Ibsen experts. He was already \"pregnant\" with his first published novel, <em>From a Crooked Rib</em> (1970), when he read Ibsen's plays as a student of philosophy&#xa0;and literature in India. The novel-in-progress was the tale of a fight&#xa0;for selfhood in a world where women are \"sold like cattle\", told through the eyes of a 19-year-old nomadic woman. \"I could&#xa0;not have written <em>From a Crooked&#xa0;Rib </em>if I had not read <em>A Doll's House</em>,\" he said at Troms\u00f8&#xa0;University. Growing up in Somalia and Ethiopia, and studying in India, he tells me, \"I saw, on a daily basis, women beaten, girls not sent to school, and the injustices meted out to women. But at 19 or 20&#xa0;I&#xa0;lacked&#xa0;the&#xa0;courage to articulate it.\" The gulf between Ibsen's Nora and his unlettered pastoralist clarified his task: \"For Ebla, even in a metaphorical&#xa0;sense, there was no door to slam.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/crooked-Rib-Penguin-Modern-Classics/dp/0141187174\" title=\"\"><em>From a Crooked Rib</em> became a Penguin Modern Classic in 2004</a>. At a time when fiction in Africa was more focused on colonial power and emerging nationhood, Farah scrutinised the intimate power play between men and women. The novel was subversive in other ways. Some women berated Farah for trespassing on their realm for exposing the horror of female genital mutilation practised among Somalis (a&#xa0;practice banned last month under Somalia's new constitution).</p> <p>His second trilogy was conceived when he returned to Somalia in 1996, for the first time in 22 years, and was taken hostage by a minor warlord. In Kismayo, \"I was kept incommunicado for a few days. The warlord sent a technical [vehicle] with 16 gunmen; he'd been told wrongly that I was a journalist, and wanted me to write an article praising him.\" The warlord's sister-in-law pleaded for Farah's release: he had been her school teacher in the early 70s. Reconsidering, his captors demanded that he deliver lectures. He complied, since there was nowhere to escape to. He shrugs at the absurdity: \"I was held hostage and gave lectures to the community.\"</p> <p>Later in Mogadishu, he was \"shocked by the destruction. It was a country I didn't recognise, and many of the people in it were newcomers.\" Since the 10th century, he argues, Mogadishu had been a cosmopolitan city-state, but with the civil war, \"it lost its old inhabitants \u2013 some of Persian, Arab and Indian origin who had intermarried. Its character changed.\" In an essay, \"Of Tamarinds and Cosmopolitans\", Farah wrote of a clash not of clans, but between pastoralist nomads and urbanites, in a once \"open city with no walls\". But he was moved by his welcome as one of Somalia's most famous sons (a celebrity matched only recently by the British Olympian Mo Farah): \"People touched me and said, Nuruddin is back, life is here. Others will come.\"</p> <p>Born in 1945 in Baidoa, in Italian Somaliland, Farah went to school in Ogaden (ceded by the British to Ethiopia) and Mogadishu. His father was an interpreter for the British governor, and his mother an oral poet. He used English textbooks, took Qur'anic lessons, and spoke Amharic, Arabic and Italian too. He claims an American typewriter had much to do with his choice of literary language. But his efforts to write in Somali, once it gained a written script in 1972, were curtailed by censorship. All his novels were later banned, and read only in smuggled copies.</p> <p>His first wife was a student from Bangalore whom he met while studying in Punjab (\"her father and I played chess\"), and their son is now an auditor in Detroit with two small daughters. Leaving Somalia in 1974 to do a master's degree in theatre at Essex University, Farah worked at London's Royal Court (\"making tea\"). When his second novel, <em>A Naked Needle</em> (1976), riled Somalia's despot, his brother advised him not to return. He was sentenced to death in absentia. \"The country died inside me, and I carried it, for a long time, like a woman with a dead baby,\" he says. \"It became the neurosis from which I write.\"</p> <p>After a trip that took in the Soviet Union, Greece under the colonels and Sadat's Egypt, he wrote his first trilogy, Variations on the Theme of an African Dictatorship (1979-83), consisting of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sweet-Variations-Theme-African-Dictatorship/dp/1555971598\" title=\"\"><em>Sweet and Sour Milk</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sardines-Variations-Theme-African-Dictatorship/dp/155597161X/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347634030&amp;sr=8-2\" title=\"\"><em>Sardines</em></a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Close-Sesame-Variations-African-Dictatorship/dp/1555971628\" title=\"\"><em>Close Sesame</em></a>. He once challenged fellow Somalis to \"study the structure of the Somali family and you will find mini-dictators imposing their will \u2026 We become replicas of the tyrant whom we hate. When you rid yourself of a monster, you become a monster.\" Somalia's implosion, which he predicted as early as 1988, fuelled a personal crisis. His mother died in 1990, when it was still unsafe to return. He got married for a second time, to a British-Nigerian academic, and moved to northern Nigeria, then South Africa.</p> <p>In his talk in Norway, he described being in a \"very difficult marriage, much worse and more debilitating than Nora's, even though I stayed in it ... maybe because I was in mourning\". As he sees it now, the collapse of Somalia \"necessitated the creation of a foundation. I was afloat, and needed an anchor. Marrying became an anchor \u2013 which was probably wrong.\" When the couple eventually split, and his children were taken to California, \"it reminded me of when I couldn't see my [elder] son.\" At that time, \"I couldn't go back; I was being hunted down. Two attempts at killing me were made, in Nigeria and Rome.\"</p> <p>As his second marriage foundered, \"writing became hard; living a lot harder.\" It took a dozen years to complete his second trilogy, <a href=\"http://us.penguingroup.com/static/rguides/us/blood_in_the_sun.html\" title=\"\"><em>Blood in the Sun</em></a> (1986-98), begun with <em>Maps</em>, set during the 1970s Ogaden war, and <em>Gifts</em>, at a time of famine. <em>Secrets</em> unfolds on the eve of civil war, and he deems it a pessimistic book. \"I was pretending to be happy, but wasn't. It's a novel that predicts terrible days.\" As a nation ruptures along bloodlines, the novel evoked incest and bestiality, \"to make everyone sit up and see the ugliness of what was happening. The entire country was a death camp\".</p> <p>Farah met his father for the first time in 17 years in a hospital in Mombasa, Kenya, and was told: \"We fled because we met the beasts in us, face to face.\" Farah's son and younger sister also fled by boat. In the non-fiction <em>Yesterday, Tomorrow</em> (2000), based on conversations with Somali refugees, Farah extrapolates from his own exile the anguish of people without means, education or a writer's creativity, when their country ceases to exist. The voices are \"raw, tearful, pained\". The book was spurred by \"two types of Somali: the poor in refugee camps in Kenya; and the rich, corrupt sons and daughters of the dictator and his cronies, staying at the Hilton in Nairobi&#xa0;and flying in private jets. I was interested in where the future of Somalia lay.\"</p> <p>He has been back often since 1996, and played peace- broker between armed groups in an effort curtailed by the Ethiopian invasion of 2006. Somalia, he says, is \"full of stories. We say, 'one sick person; a hundred doctors'. Somalia is a sick country and&#xa0;everyone has an opinion. Mine is&#xa0;one version; in a civil war, there are&#xa0;millions.\" In <em>Links</em> he wanted to offer an alternative angle on the US intervention of 1993 to the film <em>Black Hawk Down</em>. The trilogy was conceived, he says, in the context of \"misunderstandings, misconceptions and missing the point\", chief among those being that the conflict is clan warfare. Farah does not see himself as belonging to a clan. \"Anyone who claims to represent a clan is a dastardly liar. You can represent people who elected you. I can't represent my own brother.\"</p> <p><em>Crossbones</em> also casts doubt on reports of boom towns rich on piracy. Farah visited Puntland, and says: \"I did not see that wealth.\" The novel suggests those up the food chain, and abroad, take their cut. \"Nobody wants to talk about illegal fishing or the destruction of the environment \u2013 the marine life and coral reefs. What we talk about is the consequences of this destruction. There's enough UN information about nuclear and chemical waste dumped on the shores of Somalia \u2013 the tsunami unearthed it. Entire communities in Puntland have children born with deformities.\"</p> <p><em>Crossbones</em> takes place against the rise of al-Shabaab, the military wing of the Union of Islamic Courts, which has claimed allegiance to al-Qaida. Farah, who is a professor at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, says susceptible teenagers were \"told they were fighting an enemy: infidels, unbelievers, Ethiopians, the federal government.\" The militant leaders are hypocrites, he adds, who \"leave their own sons and daughters in school, and recruit other people's.\" Taxliil in the novel, a troubled teenager briefly inducted by the militants, has no exit but via Guant\u00e1namo. Farah is indignant that \"he is going to prison. He's been misled by people who don't go to prison, but their names are known.\"</p> <p>Al-Shabaab's withdrawal from Mogadishu in August last year heralded&#xa0;the city's rebirth, with the return of many expatriates. Rather than having been routed by peacekeepers, Farah says, \"Shabaab's beastly attitudes alienated people, with stories of women raped and pregnant, whipped, killed. People were afraid; now no longer. More understand that Shabaab has nothing to do with religion; it's interested in political power.\" He was once attacked online for insisting the \"Afghan-type body tent is not culturally Somali. I said: 'My mother never wore a veil, nor my sisters.' They said my mother was not a Muslim.\" In the diaspora, he argues, \"the majority could not articulate their Somali culture. The less you know about Islam, the more conservative people become.\"</p> <p>When the National Theatre in Mogadishu was devastated by a suicide bomb last April, only two weeks after reopening, Farah's response was to write a short play in Somali, though its staging may take time. Three more of his recent plays are being translated into Somali. As Jean Anouilh set Sophocles in Nazi-occupied Paris, Farah's <em>Antigone in Somalia</em> is set during the Ethiopian occupation of Mogadishu of 2006-09. Antigone's brother, whose corpse cannot be buried, is a suicide bomber. In areas al-Shabaab controls, says Farah, they have \"forbidden song and dance because they're closer to Wahhabism than most Somalis\". Theatre that is verse-based, and sung to music, \"challenges everything such groups represent. They say it's evil, Satan's work, and that a woman's place is not on the stage.\" Yet visiting Mogadishu in the spring, he found people \"playing&#xa0;music and singing in tea houses and at parties. Women have created their own space.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/16/somalia-president-power-assassination-attempt\" title=\"\">Somalia's President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud</a>, elected by MPs, took power last week, four days after surviving a suicide bombing for which al-Shabaab claimed responsibility. Though Farah has reservations about \"electing MPs and president on a clan-based formula\", he believes there is no present alternative, given years of war. The president, whom he has met, \"struck me as trustworthy, a man capable of uniting the country and taking it forward, away from attrition and in-fighting.\"</p> <p>Though his protagonists strive to leave their homeland better than they found it, good intentions go awry. Farah notes a pessimistic turn in his fiction, \"and the reason is, Somalia is no longer what it was. No matter how the characters struggle, how can you reconstruct a country that's self-destructing continuously?\" Then, under a blazing Arctic summer sun that refuses to set over the harbour, he rallies: \"I'd like the dust to settle first. It will take five more years of peace. Then good things will come.\"</p>",

After graduating with a degree in archaeology and anthropology from Bristol I attended several archaeological digs on the north coast of Peru, exploring the ancient world of the Moche population. Head up the north coast to Trujillo and explore the incredible Temple of the Moon (Huaca de la Luna), a place of ritual used by the Moche, with fantastic friezes, many of which still have their original colours. Marvel at the depictions of human sacrifice, war and terrifying deities, as well as sacred animals and daily activities.</p> <p>I would also recommend playing a game of football at high altitude, in Cusco for example. It is incredible how much more tiring it is to play sport at this altitude. But it is a lot of fun and very rewarding, and is also an excellent way to fight the hangover from the previous night, often caused by overconsumption of pisco and cocktails. You have to have a pisco sour, <em>the</em> drink of Peru, made with pisco, egg whites, ice, lime and sugar. As strange as it sounds, it is one of the most delicious cocktails I have ever tasted. If you are feeling really adventurous, in the Colca Canyon near Arequipa you can try their version, with the addition of cactus fruit, which come from cacti that grow along the edge of the canyon.</p> <p>I would also suggest spending a day as an organic farmer. In Cusco, I would recommend you sign up (available in most of the hostels) to spend a day working on an Inca farm. Not only do you learn what it is like to farm without the use of fertilisers and heavy machinery, but the farmers also have a fantastic knowledge of the medicinal values of different plants. There is a delicious lunch to reward you for your hard work.<br><em>\u2022 Read Lucy's blog at </em><a href=\"http://www.supertravelbug.wordpress.com\" title=\"\"><em>supertravelbug.wordpress.com</em></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396476040\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/9/21/1348223738489/Jardin-008.jpg\" alt=\"Jardin\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jard\u00edn, in northern Colombia</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Erin McNeaney and Simon Fairbairn, both 31, from Manchester</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396476041\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/9/21/1348223092178/Erin-001.jpg\" alt=\"Erin\" width=\"70\" height=\"70\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Erin McNeaney </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2010, we sold everything we owned to travel the world indefinitely, working as digital nomads through South America, Central America, the US, Canada and Asia.

On Saturday nights locals ride their horses to the main square and parade around, showing off and stopping outside one of the bars for a drink and a chat.</p> <p>From there we enjoyed a treacherous but exciting mountainside horse ride to La Cueva del Esplendor, to visit a waterfall within a cave and take a <em>telef\u00e9rico</em> (cable car) trip for views over the town and the surrounding green mountains and coffee and banana plantations.<br><em>\u2022 Read more about Erin and Simon's travels at </em><a href=\"http://www.neverendingvoyage.com/\" title=\"\"><em>neverendingvoyage.com</em></a><em>, where you can also download their free ebook, called South America Highlights</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396476042\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/9/21/1348224068419/The-swing-001.jpg\" alt=\"The swing\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The swing at the end of the world, Ba\u00f1os, Ecuador</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Leah Hoelscher, 25, from Kansas, US</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396476043\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/9/21/1348223060257/Leah-001.jpg\" alt=\"Leah\" width=\"70\" height=\"70\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leah</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I'm currently in Ecuador, near the beginning of a 100-day journey through Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina. My latest discovery was the \"swing at the end of the world\" in Ecuador. Ba\u00f1os is well known for its outdoor activities, but I've only met one other backpacker who knew about the swing. By hiking up the path to Bellavista from the edge of Ba\u00f1os, you reach a viewpoint and a seismic monitoring station named La Casa del \u00c1rbol, a treehouse on the edge of a cliff, with a swing hanging right over the precipice. It's a ton of fun to swing over the open space.</p> <p>I also enjoyed Chocol Arte Cafe in Mindo (<a href=\"http://www.chocolartemindo.com\" title=\"\">chocolartemindo.com</a>), a small town north of Quito in lush cloud forest, a great destination for hiking, birdwatching or ziplining but with a blossoming cafe culture. The cafe was founded by a German woman who also owns a chocolate farm in Mindo. I spent hours in there, enjoying the coffee, hot chocolate, brownies and other treats, chatting with locals, expats and travellers alike. It has a fun Swiss Family Robinson look to it as well. <br><em>\u2022 Follow Leah on Twitter at </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/leahhoelscher\" title=\"\"><em>@leahhoelscher</em></a><em> and read her blog at </em><a href=\"http://littlearrow.wordpress.com/\" title=\"\"><em>littlearrow.wordpress.com</em></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396476044\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/9/21/1348224345612/Coroico-001.jpg\" alt=\"Coroico\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Looking down a zipline in Coroico, Bolivia</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Ollie Roberts, 27, from Tasmania, Australia</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396476045\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/9/21/1348223356414/Ollie-001.jpg\" alt=\"Ollie\" width=\"70\" height=\"70\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ollie Roberts </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I've been travelling through Latin America since last June with my girlfriend, Bronnie. We would have missed out on some special experiences if we'd followed advice from fellow travellers and locals, so my biggest tip to anyone would be to just venture out and do it. Don't listen to those who say something or somewhere is bad or dangerous. You never know if you never go.</p> <p>Some favourites include Bucaramanga, a city about eight hours north of Bogot\u00e1 in Colombia, which was very chilled and easygoing. We caught up with a local there whom we'd met in Lima earlier in the trip. He showed us the nightlife, which was buzzing. We also chilled out on a hill watching all the paragliders. There aren't many tourists here, so you aren't hassled as you might be elsewhere.</p> <p>Another great experience was relaxing in the sleepy hillside village of Coroico in Bolivia, near the end of the infamous \"Death Road\". We spent Christmas at a tranquil place called Bonita Villa, run by a lovely family. We spent six nights here \u2013 a long time for us as we are surfers and tend to become fidgety staying somewhere without surf for long.</p> <p>I don't really want to give away any surf spots that we found, but I'll share one, called Pu\u00e9mape, in Peru. It's in front of a tiny fishing village about 30 minutes' drive south of Pacasmayo. Get there before the wind picks up and you'll most likely have it to yourself. It breaks left in front and over rocks, and can be really fun, with lots of sections.<br><em>\u2022 Read about Ollie and Bronnie's trips at </em><a href=\"http://bronandollie.netai.net/\" title=\"\"><em>bronandollie.netai.net</em></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396476046\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/9/21/1348224744827/Tarija-001.jpg\" alt=\"Tarija\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The women of Tarija are said to have beautiful smiles.

Bolivia is one of the most visually stunning places in South America, from Lake Titicaca in the north to the salt flats in the south. Many people start their salt flats tour in Uyuni, but we'd recommend taking the train all the way to Tupiza and taking a salt flats tour from there that ends in Uyuni. You get an additional day or two travelling through red rocks and landscapes that are beautiful, but different than what you see around Uyuni. In addition, the quality of the tours is often higher because there is not as much competition as in Uyuni. We went with <a href=\"http://www.tupizatours.com/\" title=\"\">Tupiza Tours</a> and had a great experience.</p> <p>Another place that we really liked and hardly gets any tourists is Tarija, close to the border with Argentina. It's like a little vacation from Bolivia with a focus on wine tasting, good food and has a super-friendly, relaxed feel. One of our favourite places to eat was Bufalo on the main plaza, where you could order tapas or plates of cheese and meats while watching local life go by. One of the best lunch menus on the main square was at Club Social Tarija \u2013 Argentine meat and beautifully cooked meals with great service for $3.50. <br>\u2022<em> Audrey and Daniel blog about their travels at </em><a href=\"http://www.uncorneredmarket.com/\" title=\"\"><em>uncorneredmarket.com</em></a></p>",
  "<p>\"P<em>atagonia sin represas!</em>\" screamed the hoarding on the roadside \u2013 Patagonia without dams. If the sign spoiled the view, it was nothing to what might befall the beautiful landscape we were passing through if the Chilean government goes ahead with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/apr/05/chilean-court-patagonia-dam\" title=\"\">plans \u2013 on hold since June \u2013 to flood 6,000 hectares of pristine wilderness to provide electricity</a> to power the rapidly growing economy.</p> <p>For four days my girlfriend and I had been driving along the Carretera Austral, Chile's great 1,250km southern highway, penetrating deep into the remote province of Ais\u00e9n. We'd flown into drizzly Balmaceda airport and headed south-west. The road surface deteriorated but the weather improved and we found ourselves all alone in our hired pick-up in a wonderland of glaciated valleys, temperate rainforest and back-of-beyond hamlets. In the distance loomed the serrated wall of the Andes, topped with snow.</p> <p>Stays in a budget hostel and then a smart riverside lodge had taken us close to three of Ais\u00e9n's postcard sights. The first was Lago General Carrera, South America's second-biggest lake, whose unnatural-looking Persian green water, unbroken by flecks of white or even ripples, was both alluring and alienating.</p> <p>A side road took us past seven more lakes \u2013 we walked around one to shake off the creases you get on long car journeys \u2013 and, after a couple of hours' driving through antediluvian montane forests, to the Exploradores glacier. Hanging off the north-eastern face of Monte San Valent\u00edn, the highest mountain in Chilean Patagonia, the great blue-white tongue \u2013 and the wispy lenticular clouds \u2013 reminded me that the northern Patagonian ice field was just around the corner.</p> <p>The smart lodge was on fast-flowing Baker river, revered by anglers, feared by rafters, east of the ice field. I drove up to its source at nearby Puerto Bertrand and saw a deep lake basically being siphoned into a very narrow, shallow watercourse. Downriver from the lodge the Baker, also surreally green, tumbled over high cliffs and, in a maelstrom of grey glacier melt and freezing river, merged with the Nef to continue south to the Pacific.</p> <p>We were heading in the same direction, with superlative vistas piling up one after the other. Hacienda Tres Lagos sits beside its own deep green (and alarmingly cold) lake at the bottom of a mountain \u2013 but was equipped with a barbecue shack, where we feasted on grilled lamb, and a wine bar where we sampled the latest Patagonian varietals.</p> <p>But it was only when we turned left at Entrada Baker that the view was genuinely surprising \u2013 shocking even. The Patagonia we had seen so far had fitted all my notions of Chile: the Baker valley, like the country, was narrow, hemmed in by geology, packed with coig\u00fce, \u00f1irre and lenga beech trees, riven by cascades and streams.</p> <p>But the Chacabuco valley east of Entrada Baker was wide open to the sky, with bright golden steppe carpeting an immense plain. Guanacos (small Patagonian relatives of the llama) grazed and rolled in the dust, hawks circled overhead and strange wind-resistant plants exploded out of the arid earth. We were travelling into a region where the deserts of Argentinian Patagonia reach for the Pacific, adding another ecosystem to Ais\u00e9n's already varied landscape.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396582129\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/9/20/1348133678582/Lago-G-Carrera-001.jpg\" alt=\"Lago G Carrera\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Looking across Lago General Carerra to the Andes</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Moss</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After driving for half an hour along a winding back road we came to the lodge built by philanthropist Kris Tompkins for her latest park project. Kris, former CEO of outdoor clothing firm Patagonia, and her husband, Doug (of the North Face and Esprit chain) are well-known in Argentina and Chile for purchasing swathes of virgin forest and wetland and donating them to the respective states as national parks.</p> <p>The Parque Nacional Patagonia (<a href=\"http://www.patagonialandtrust.org/\" title=\"\">patagonialandtrust.org</a>) is the latest and perhaps most exciting of all their projects. Once an estancia overgrazed by sheep and cattle, these 70,000 hectares will bridge the gap between two existing reserves to create a national park three times that size.</p> <p>We stayed just one night at the park's Yellowstone-style lodge, but I found time to chat to the staff and to head out into the hills. The park can be seen as a sort of symbolic counter-gesture to the plans to dam the Baker.</p> <p>\"The proposed dam is old technology,\" Doug told me. \"The only viable industry for Ais\u00e9n is tourism, and if we bring in 250,000 visitors eventually it can be another Torres del Paine. Fisheries won't work here, food won't, logging won't and farming didn't. We're putting backpackers first here. The lodge is here only to subsidise the campsites.\"</p> <p>For almost five centuries, Ais\u00e9n has remained the least visited, least settled corner of Patagonia and maybe of southern South America. Its preservation may now depend on attracting as many low-impact visitors as possible. The self-indulgent traveller in me would like to keep the road lonely and romantic; but if a few rented pick-ups and a campsite are the alternative to caravans of dumper trucks and cranes and a flooded valley, bring them on.

  "<p>Only seconds after we left the hotel, the attacks began. The first hit got me right in the face, a direct shot from a passing car \u2013 a drive-by. A second came from a gang of youths hiding in an alleyway. Then the bombs came thick and fast. As we edged towards the centre of town, they pelted us from hidden corners, and bombarded us from unnoticed balconies. Within an hour we were drenched.</p> <p>Sequins, beads and feather headdresses have their place but, in Bolivia, carnival time is celebrated first with water fights. From late January and throughout February, Bolivians young and old take to the streets for spontaneous water fights, using water balloons, spray cans of foam, and semi-automatic-sized water pistols.</p> <p>\"I'm sorry,\" Javier, our contact in La Paz, had warned my friend Anna and me before we set off to Sucre, Bolivia's attractive judicial capital, \"but as tourists you will be targeted even more!\" He wasn't wrong. While exploring the colourful buildings, craft markets and cool little bars of small, neat Sucre \u2013 very different from vast, rambling La Paz \u2013 we wore cagoules with the hoods pulled tight, and wrapped our cameras in carrier bags.</p> <p>Being drawn into a giant nationwide water fight wasn't the only festive fun. Though our month in Bolivia began a week before the big carnival parades, the country was already in party mode. Balloons, flags, flower garlands and streamers decorated every building; bands were playing their way around town on foot; and at weekends it was hard to spot a child not in fancy dress.</p> <p>One morning we were buying textiles in one of Sucre's craft stores when we heard a brass band outside. Poking our heads out, we were swept along by a dancer who took us by the arms and twirled us along for several blocks.</p> <p>Days later, we arrived at midnight in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2012/may/11/bolivia-hotels-uyuni-desert-mountains\" title=\"\">Uyuni</a>, the desolate outpost town near the country's incredible salt flats, in a terrible storm after a grim 10-hour bus journey from Potos\u00ed. We were amazed to hear the strains of folk music floating out of the darkness from a little brass band playing their hearts out in the rain in the deserted street.</p> <p>While these small celebrations add a joyful dimension to South American travel at this time of year, we would have been mad to miss one of the continent's biggest carnival parades, El Carnaval de Oruro, a week-long Rio-style procession of dozens of dancing troupes from all over Bolivia who gather in an isolated mining town on the southern Altiplano. Performing in fantastic costumes and huge masks, they continue for several sleepless days and nights, fuelled by strong spirits and <em>chicha, </em>a thick bubbly slop made from fermented corn.</p> <p>The celebration is shown continually on Bolivian TV and becomes the focus of the nation's attention while it's on. Traditional dance groups and Oruro's own Diablada (\"devil\" dancers in special costumes) rehearse all year and spend hundreds of dollars on each costume, forming a parade thousands strong, with thousands more spectators travelling to attend.</p> <p>It is a complex mix of Christian and indigenous tales and rituals, an expression of good over evil, of native groups over the Spanish. The dominant explanation says it commemorates the Virgin of Candelaria who, legend has it, helped an injured thief reach his home in Oruro to die and left her image in a cave where she has been worshipped by the mining community ever since.</p> <p>I had imagined a quaint folk-dancing show, but then I exchanged emails with travel blogger Jamie Lafferty, who sent me a link to <a href=\"http://idoneaholiday.blogspot.co.uk/2011/03/party-time-or-how-i-decided-to-stop.html\" title=\"\">his report</a> of the previous year's event. This rather literally pissed on our parade: he described being beaten up and robbed at knife-point, waking up in hospital, and wild drunks peeing in the streets (and on his girlfriend). We bought waterproofs and went anyway.</p> <p>The rest of the year, Oruro is just a poor unvisited mining town, with few recommendable sights, redeeming features, or hotels. The lack of infrastructure means it is not the easiest festival to attend, and those who turn up without a hotel room booked months in advance might be lucky to share a room in a private home with dozens of others.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396478636\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/9/20/1348148586121/Carnival-in-Sajama-001.jpg\" alt=\"Carnival in Sajama\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carnival time in Sajama, Bolivia. Photograph by Anna Batchelor</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another overnight bus journey (they're unavoidable if you want to see Bolivia properly) from Uyuni had taken us right through Oruro the night before the main day of the parade, but we were warned not to get off as it was the middle of the night, dangerous, and there would be nowhere to go. So we stayed on until La Paz and arranged for a driver to take us back to Oruro the next day.</p> <p>Even in the morning the atmosphere was frenetic. We had to push through crowds covered in foam to get to the parade, then wait ages for a space to become free on one of the rough tiered benches set up for spectators. As we took our seats, the Bolivians seated around us shouted \"no! no!\" and tried to shoo us away, worried we would attract water attacks. But several hours later we were sharing beers, crackers and coca leaves with them, singing and cheering the energetic procession. Dancers in glittering thigh-high boots, ra-ra skirts and feathered bowler hats strutted by, dashing drummers leapt and jangled their ankle bells, and suited band members, too drunk to keep their eyes open or play their instruments, wobbled along hilariously, all creating a spectacle.</p> <p>After seeing another similarly noisy, sparkly big-city parade in La Paz, we felt we'd like to see how people celebrated in their normal lives, too.</p> <p>Throughout the carnival period, but particularly on Shrove Tuesday, Bolivian families gather to perform <em>cha'lla</em>, a ceremony of thanks to Pachamama, the earth mother. Blood and alcohol are sprinkled at the corners of their homes, villages and sacred sites, sayings are repeated, streamers hung and fire-crackers let off.</p> <p>Cha'lla is part of life whether you're Aymara, Quechua, or mestizo, and most folk are Catholic, too. In La Paz, I saw cha'llas on battered old cars, fast-food joints and dirty street corners, and Javier told us one day he was off to bless his office, including the computer (presumably without the llama blood).</p> <p>To witness more traditional cha'lla ceremonies away from the cities, we drove south-west across the Altiplano, to a village called Curahuara de Carangas. In the sunny square they were blessing trees festooned with balloons, and preparing for a feast to be thrown by the mayor.</p> <p>\"I'm so sorry,\" he said when we met, \"you have just missed the sacrifice of the llamas!\"</p> <p>How disappointing. Instead, we accepted an invitation to a village council meeting. He and his wife, dressed in their finest red and green ponchos and woven shawls, sat at the head of a table upon which lay a big bowl of coca leaves and the heads of 30 llamas, gifts from local families. We chewed our leaves politely while the council decided a suitable punishment for a man who'd got drunk at the party and hit his wife (a certain number of bricks would have to be made for the village, they agreed).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396478635\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/9/21/1348221448671/Houses-in-sleepy-Sajama-a-001.jpg\" alt=\"Houses in sleepy Sajama, at the foot of Bolivia's highest mountain\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Houses in sleepy Sajama, at the foot of Bolivia's highest mountain</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Next we reached Sajama, Bolivia's oldest national park, near the Chilean border, where Bolivia's highest mountain, Nevado Sajama (6,542m), rises up as a perfect snowy cone. Sajama village was so sleepy we thought we'd missed everything, and we were the only guests at the Albergue Ecoturistico Tomarapi just outside, jointly owned by 36 families.</p> <p>But the area is also a spectacular place for hiking. To go high-altitude trekking in Sajama, we only needed to step out of our door: the village is at 4,200m. We roamed higher, over plains of green moss and quinoa fields, among herds of llama and alpaca. The world's highest forest \u2013 of underwhelming dwarf <em>que\u00f1ua</em> trees \u2013 grows here and there were bubbling multi-coloured geysers and hot springs where we swam down peaty channels.</p> <p>And then, one late afternoon, as the sky turned purple behind the snow-capped volcanos, the village suddenly came out. The boys mounted wild-looking ponies, women in frilly shiny skirts began to dance, and the men got out their <em>quena</em> flutes. They all formed a small but beautiful procession on the cold muddy streets and we followed them as they blessed each corner of their shabby little village for what had passed that year, and what might lie ahead.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The trip was provided by High Lives (</em><a href=\"http://www.highlives.co.uk/default.aspx?pageid=132\" title=\"\"><em>highlives.co.uk</em></a><em>).

  "<p>It's minus five outside. Not great conditions for roughing it. The previous night, in an unheated, near-deserted refuge covered in snow, we had bedded down in extreme-weather sleeping bags, complete with hoods. But tonight, after a thrilling 20-mile hike through some of the finest scenery on the planet, we are warm, dry and, frankly, ecstatic beneath polar blankets in a chic ecodome that feels more penthouse than campsite. Steam rises from our boots as they dry by the log-burning stove and, through the round windows in the curved ceiling, I can pick out what seems like every star in the southern sky.</p> <p>\"This is sublime,\" I think, as I ease myself off my furry headboard and pour another glass of velvety Chilean red. \"Where is everyone?\"</p> <p>They're at home waiting for the southern winter to end, that's where. And when it does, Torres del Paine \u2013 the jewel of Patagonia, with its mountains, rivers, lakes, forests, fjords, icebergs and glaciers \u2013 will be full of tourists. This won't spoil the views, but it will detract from the wild character of this national park virtually at the end of the world. To reach the three colossal <em>torres</em> \u2013 the towers that stand like granite sentinels over the whole massif \u2013 you may actually have to queue in summer. Going out of season involves certain hardships, but you pay less and practically have the place to yourself.</p> <p>There are no roads in. In summer (November-March) <a href=\"http://www.360cities.net/image/crossing-lake-pehoe-catamaran#-562.86,-2.94,68.1\" title=\"\">a catamaran</a> shuttles visitors over Lake Peho\u00e9 to the unheated <a href=\"http://www.verticepatagonia.com/node/1\" title=\"\">Refugio Paine Grande</a>, our first stop, and the only place to sleep around these parts, unless you've brought a tent. We had no choice but to hoof it. The five-hour hike from where our Puerto Natales minibus dropped us on our first day would take us across a plain prone to screamingly violent winds, a result of Torres del Paine, on the southern tip of South America, being pretty much bordered by two oceans and a bit too close to Antarctica. You can see <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvcDJi1kYxU&amp;feature=related\" title=\"\">hilarious clips of hikers</a> flailing around the trail on YouTube.</p> <p>\"We came in yesterday,\" a German backbacker told us at the refuge. \"The wind was so bad we had to put on sunglasses and walk backwards.\"</p> <p>We tried not to feel too smug as we ate our Bombay Bad Boy flavour Pot Noodles after a wind-free day of cloudless skies. I'm sure the catamaran's fabulous, but I'd take that walk, past a winding river and through an eerie forest of wind-snapped trees, any day. And the blasts are worse in summer, apparently.</p> <p>Since we only had four days, my pal Richard and I were doing a half-circuit of the massif, travelling anti-clockwise around its southern flank towards the ecodomes and a climactic climb up to the towers. This took us through some of the area that, in December last year, three months after our trip, was devastated by fire. Although the park was briefly closed, the area around the towers was unaffected; a restoration programme is now under way.</p> <p>Our route gave us two nights at the refuge (an unlovely building redeemed by giant windows and superb views), so we had time for a detour to <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Glacier+Grey&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VmjBTqSRIo7D8QOnu_ivBA&amp;ved=0CDcQsAQ&amp;biw=1084&amp;bih=935&amp;sei=W2jBTo6vIMvz8QOkkKmLBA\" title=\"\">Glacier Grey</a>. It's a long, tough hike, but we'd come prepared: I had a bottle of Jura single malt and two tumblers in my backpack. We fell asleep planning an unforgettable wee dram of whisky on the glacier the next day, made with ice chipped off its vast crevasse fields.</p> <p>And then it snowed. We had shut the curtains on blue skies and shimmering peaks; we opened them in the morning to a world of white. OK, it was still winter, but only just; these were freak conditions for the tail end of September. We set off in thermals and waterproofs, with the snow still falling and the views intermittent.</p> <p>The Jura went undrunk, on the walk at least. While beautiful, the going \u2013 around lakes and through woods on a trail peppered with whopping snow-capped boulders \u2013 was slow. We turned back just before the final descent to the glacier, wet, cold, hungry and unlikely to see much as the snow hadn't let up, although a couple of icebergs did tempt me to get my gloves off and the camera out. You know you're on quite a walk, I remember thinking later as the feeling slowly returned to my fingers, when icebergs are the consolation prize.</p> <p>You can see images of Torres del Paine (<em>paine</em> means blue in the local Tehuelche language) wherever you are in Chile: the national park is pictured on the country's beer cans and banknotes. Cans of Austral beer, made in Punta Arenas, depict a section called Los Cuernos (the horns), which is unlike any mountain I've ever seen: a ravishing, impossibly vertiginous two-tone arrangement of ridges, ramparts, fins, folds, spikes and spires.</p> <p>And now, on our third day, we were strolling past them, on a glorious, sun-filled 20-mile hike to EcoCamp Patagonia, past gleaming snow-lined fjords, and across shaky rope bridges spanning roaring rivers. By late afternoon, exhausted but elated, we reached the camp and our spacious dome, wind-tested to withstand blasts of 150mph. It had a scalding hot shower (with biodegradable soap) and a stove that was described as low-emission, although it probably wasn't after we'd squeezed every log we could into it.</p> <p>We were the only guests at the ecocamp, which opened a decade ago and boasts 25 domes linked by a wooden walkway through fabulously twisted southern beeches. Seafood stew with shrimp and scallops was on the menu that night, washed down by a bottle of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2007/sep/16/foodanddrink.shopping\" title=\"\">Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re</a> and preceded by a glass of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2000/aug/05/weekend7.weekend4\" title=\"\">pisco sour</a> \u2013 the addictive cocktail made with brandy, ice, sugar, bitters, egg white and green lemon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396476542\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/9/19/1348072301967/EcoCamp-Patagonia-001.jpg\" alt=\"EcoCamp Patagonia\" width=\"460\" height=\"549\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dome at EcoCamp Patagonia. Photograph: Andrew Gilchrist</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Gilchrist</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>OK, the restaurant dome, behind groovy triangular doors, was so cold we had to dine wearing snow jackets, hats and gloves, but there's fun in that, especially if you've just spent two days eating leftovers and Bombay Bad Boys. And it meant we were well equipped to nip outside to watch the sun set spectacularly through the towers.</p> <p>\"The forecast for tomorrow,\" said Victor, the assistant manager, cheerily as he brought us a bottle for the room, \"is sun all day.\" I think he was glad of some company.</p> <p>You can spend a week in Torres del Paine, at any time of the year, and end up seeing nothing, so unpredictable is its micro-climate. So when we set off for the towers in bright, clear conditions, we felt like the luckiest guys on earth. And it was a bit of a doddle, no harder than your average Scottish munro: a delightful ascent through forests, up gorges, and along riverbanks hemmed in by majestic mountains. The only tough part was a steep boulder-field near the summit, a hazardous stretch where a thick blanket of snow left you uncertain as to whether you were stepping onto solid rock or deep drift. I only got it wrong once, but it still caused me to snap a pole. Oh well, better than an ankle.</p> <p>And then we reached the Mirador, the climax of our trip: the viewpoint at the summit from which the towers shoot upwards. I've been hiking up mountains for 10 years now, mostly in Scotland, and it felt like every step I'd taken had been towards this magical place. We stayed up there for 45 thrilling minutes, in the sun and the snow and the silence, gazing at the mighty towers and the frozen lake.</p> <p>I've since seen photos of the Mirador in summer: while the towers still look spectacular, the rest is a bit grey, washed out and lunar-looking. Doing the climb in snow was electrifying. Not only were the views full of glistening contrasts, but I got to feel like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/video/2008/jan/11/edmund.hillary.everest\" title=\"\">Edmund Hillary</a> conquering Everest.</p> <p>We packed up and headed back towards the ecocamp \u2013 and another evening of hearty food, lovely booze and a staggering sunset \u2013 wondering if anything could ever beat this. About a mile from our dome, we met a Chilean hiker in purple shades. He puffed his cheeks out when we told him what distances we'd walked, what wonders we'd seen, over four days.</p> <p>\"That's the stuff,\" he said, as the sun dipped once again behind the towers. \"Go hard or go home, eh?\"</p> <p><em>\u2022 Iberia (</em><a href=\"http://www.iberia.com\" title=\"\"><em>iberia.com</em></a><em>) flies daily from Heathrow to Santiago via Madrid from \u00a3892 return.

  "<p>\u2712 I feel sorry for Nick Clegg, who is a decent man. People always bang on about how politicians should be straight with us and admit their failings, but as soon as he does, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2012/sep/20/nick-clegg-apology-video-parodies\" title=\"\">he becomes the subject of yet more ridicule</a>. I fear a tipping point has been reached, as it often does with politicians. John Major was thought hopelessly dull and incompetent, and it's only 15 years later that he has some kind of reputation restored. John Prescott is still locked into the buffoon stage, and may never recover even if he becomes a police commissioner. Now there is nothing Clegg can do. He could produce a dazzling plan that saved the British economy, win Olympic gold, or rescue three children from a blazing building. But he would still be a figure of fun, and remain so for another decade.</p> <p>\u2712 As my colleague Stephen Bates pointed out, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/19/papyrus-jesus-wife-academic-debate?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">the scrap of papyrus scroll with the line \"Jesus said to them, 'my wife'</a>\u2026\" does sound like the beginning of a joke, possibly by Henny Youngman, the British-born American comedian famous for one-liners about wives. \"Jesus said: 'Someone stole my credit cards. I'm not reporting it \u2013 the thief spends less than my wife!'\"</p> <p>Or, \"And Jesus said unto them, 'my wife just spent two hours in the beauty parlour. And that was just for the estimate'.\" Or, \"Verily, brethren, I take my wife everywhere. But she keeps finding her way back!\" It would have perked up Sunday school no end.</p> <p>\u2712 Like any average pervert, I've been pondering the Duchess of Cambridge's breasts this week, and the fact that these days it's rare to see any member of the royal family who's not naked. I was reminded of the old Dennis Pennis gag about Demi Moore: \"If it wasn't gratuitous in any way and it was tastefully done, would you consider keeping your clothes on in a movie?\"</p> <p>I spent long enough on the internet to find the cover of the French magazine that first aired the breasts, and of course they were as blurry as you'd expect from a picture taken half a mile away. And not remotely sexy. If it's pert, colourful, non-pixillated bosoms you want, then page 3 of the Sun is far more rewarding \u2013 though the whole point about their young women is that they look innocent rather than alluring, rather as if they're saying, \"oops, you just caught me sunbathing in the garden; I'll pop inside and put something on.\"</p> <p>Topless Kate isn't about sex at all but about intrusion, a sense of invading the privacy of the rich, famous and powerful, a feeling that you are getting one over those set above us. In the same way no one could find the internet shots of Britney Spears's knickers arousing, just humiliating for her, and unpleasantly, secretly rewarding for us.</p> <p>\u2712 Last week I mentioned how <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/sep/15/us-election-obama-romney\" title=\"\">Stephen Pile had identified James William Davison, who edited the magazine Musical World in Victorian times, as the worst ever music critic</a>. He excoriated, among others, Tchaikovsky, Verdi, Wagner, Chopin, Berlioz, Schumann and Schubert, saving his praise only for one man whose fame would be celebrated by posterity: William Sterndale Bennett.</p> <p>Like most people I had never heard of Sterndale Bennett, but Guardian readers are fantastically knowledgeable, and Jeremy Beecham emailed almost immediately to say that he had two Sterndale Bennett CD's in his car and enjoyed listening to them.</p> <p>And not only is he recorded on CD but you can buy them! Which I did, and am listening to his first piano concerto as I write. It's not bad at all and even pleasantly melodic \u2013 he is no musical McGonagall. But like so much derivative music, you do have the feeling, as you listen for the first time, that you have heard it all before.</p> <p>\u2712 I see that someone in Scotland has applied to the EU this week for <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/quality/schemes/index_en.htm\" title=\"\">protected designation of origin</a> (PDO) for the deep-fried Mars bar, so it would be on a level with champagne and Cornish pasties. A joke, I assume, since Mars bars are not lovingly handmade in Scotland, but that hasn't stopped various Scots from defending the delicacy, largely on the grounds that it is honest working-class fare and only English snobs mock it.</p> <p>I don't myself, having had a classy version in a London restaurant \u2013 the Mars bar was sliced in half lengthwise, then fried in crisp filo pastry and dusted with icing sugar. It was delicious. I think what people south of the border don't comprehend is the \"Mars bar supper\", which includes the battered confectionery served with chips. You can also get the Jaffa cake supper, and the Cadbury's creme egg supper. I'd love a PDO meal served in a Michelin-starred eatery, including foie gras de Strasbourg, poulet de Bresse polished off with a Snickers supper.</p> <p>\u2712I taped an edition of Private Passions for Radio 3 this week (out soon, if you're interested and if they think it's worth broadcasting). No Sterndale Bennett sadly, but I chose an aria by Donizetti. The composer Michael Berkeley, who presents the programme, told me about a distant edition of My Music, which included John Amis and Frank Muir. Amis said that it was believed Donizetti had died of excessive self-abuse. \"Ah,\" said Muir, \"you might say that he died by his own hand.\"</p> <p>The outraged BBC refused to broadcast the whole programme, and only relented much later when they aired it, without the offending lines. I doubt that would happen now.</p> <p>\u2712On my way to Michael Berkeley's home in Notting Hill I passed a street sweeper, for whom I felt sorry \u2013 you just knew his annual wages would barely buy a square foot of floor space in one of those huge houses.</p> <p>He was in an altercation, because I heard him yelling down his phone, \"don't give me that fucking [bad word] you fucking [even worse word], fuck you,\" and so on for two or three minutes as I passed. I looked back and saw on his hi-vis jacket the words: \"Love the streets you live in.\"</p>",
  "<p>A young robin had learned old tricks in the gardens of the RSPB lodge. It would come from nowhere, an unbidden genie, popping up on the flagstone path, or jumping up on skinny legs like the shiny tips of brown shoelaces to the arm of an occupied bench. A coquettish cock of the head caused one woman to unfurl her paper napkin and dispense crumbs of fruitcake. Here was the most beguiling beggar.</p> <p>The robin and I had some kind of rite of passage the other day. I was leading a group around the gardens, knowing that it would appear without cue. And there it was among us: ice-lolly orange breast dazzling, black eyes knowingly bright. Its throat pumped vigorously and a soft and beautiful stream of notes came forth, though its beak was closed for this unsung melody.</p> <p>Someone handed me a cereal bar and I broke off some pieces and laid my upturned palm on the ground. The bird drew closer in a series of 90 degree swivelling hops. Each twisting bounce brought a subtle change of colour in its plumage, drawing out the moss green in its earth-brown back and wings, bringing to the fore the RAF blue in the greyish-blue border around its breast. Little white kiss-curl feather wisps sprouted from under its wings. As it reached my fingertips, the one colour that stood out most was the lustrous orange on its front. At that moment, I could only wonder how anyone could possibly think a robin to be red.</p> <p>The bird made a short series of deft stabs. I felt only delicate taps of its beak into the gaps between my fingers. And then the food was gone, and so too was the robin, half flying, half skipping. The audience gave murmurs of approval but I felt something else \u2013 an intense rush of happiness. Whatever our pleasure in distant observation, there is nothing quite like the intimacy of such an encounter \u2013 the physical contact that signifies the winning of fleeting trust from a wild creature.</p>",
  "<p>Nothing beats an argument over free speech and religion to bring out entrenched positions and prejudices. The saddest part of the street and rhetorical battles over the infamous anti-Muhammad video is that it plays to bigots on both sides.</p> <p>In pre-internet days, the musings of a saddo somewhere in the world would become known only to that person's close friends \u2013 plus the recipients of the odd green-ink letter. Now, you can draw attention to pretty much anything. Even so, it still took some time for the Innocence of Muslims to gain the attention its creator so desperately sought.</p> <p>The best description of the 14-minute video I have heard so far comes from Tony Blair (not a man I've taken to applaud too often in recent years). But the word \"laughable\" sums it up accurately. It is not worthy of being taken seriously. As for the Charlie Hebdo cartoons, this is a satirical magazine: horses for courses.</p> <p>Beneath the welter of comment and emotion, there has been a reluctance to debate the principles underlying this supposed clash of civilisations. On one point, most agree: violence is unacceptable. So far, so easy.</p> <p>But what about incitement to violence? Direct incitement \u2013 \"I don't like Mr Cohen/Mr Singh who lives in number 22, I suggest we go after him\" \u2013 is clear. But is \"insult\", which could lead to violence, the same thing? Andrew Brown, writing in the Guardian, appeared to think so, when he argued: \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/andrewbrown/2012/sep/12/libya-anti-muhammad-youtube-clips\" title=\"\">This film is purely and simply an incitement to religious hatred</a>.\" He added that it was \"obviously blasphemous to Muslims\".</p> <p>This typifies a merging of distinctive issues. Incitement is a direct exhortation to violence. It is not saying something that could lead to violence by people who feel offended. Nor is it the same as religious and racial hatred, which in turn is separate from \"blasphemy\".</p> <p>Who better to turn to on these issues than Aryeh Neier? A long-time leading light of Human Rights Watch and the Open Society Foundation, he stumbled into this maelstrom more than 40 years ago. More than 40 years ago, as head of the American Civil Liberties Union, Neier (a Jewish refugee from Nazi Germany) defended the right of a neo-Nazi group to march through Skokie, Illinois, home to a number of Holocaust survivors. He has since reflected long and hard about his decision.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/freedom--blasphemy--and-violence-by-aryeh-neier\" title=\"\">Writing this week, Neier said</a>: \"It is important to differentiate blasphemy from hate speech. What is objectionable about hate speech, and makes it punishable by law in countries around the world, is that it is intended to incite discrimination or violence against members of a particular national, racial, ethnic, or religious group.\" Yet he added: \"Judgments about literary or artistic merit should not be the basis for decisions about freedom of expression. The proclivity of some elsewhere to react violently to what they consider blasphemous cannot be the criterion for imposing limits on free expression.\"</p> <p>Do some folk need more protecting than others? It might be bad taste to disparage, say, the Cornish, or vegetarians, but unless I've missed something I haven't come across too many wounded souls. It's important, therefore, to achieve some clarity in questions of treatment. Does the recent focus on \"blasphemy\" suggest a special dispensation for religion? In an attempt to defuse tensions, the EU, the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, the Arab League and the African Union issued a message reiterating \"profound respect for all religions\". They then added, in a classic fudge: \"While fully recognising freedom of expression, we believe in the importance of respecting all prophets, regardless of which religion they belong to.\"</p> <p>If, as this seems to imply, speech might be circumscribed to protect religious belief (a suggestion most would surely bridle at), should all religions be treated the same? If so, issues around particular grievances (Iraq, Afghanistan, Israel-Palestine, Guant\u00e1namo, take your pick) become irrelevant.</p> <p>Does Islam require special favours? In the New York Times, Thomas Friedman suggested that Muslims are just as likely to impugn other religions as they are likely to be upset themselves. Most of the recent free expression-v-offence battles have revolved around Islam \u2013 from the Satanic Versus to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/nov/07/terrorism.religion\" title=\"\">Theo van Gogh</a> to the Danish cartoons to now. That is not to say that other religions and races do not complain, but the nature of the grievance \u2013 real or manufactured \u2013 appears to be of a different magnitude.</p> <p>As an ardent advocate of free expression, my instinct is always to hold to first principles. Barring direct incitement or other clearly illegal activity (such as child pornography), one should surely trust in common sense, while seeking to ignore and isolate rather than ban. A thick skin is the essence of a&#xa0;mature society.</p> <p>These first principles are most vividly enshrined in the US first amendment. But for many in the Middle East and elsewhere, that amendment is another example of cultural hegemony. For as long as freedom of expression is seen in parts of the world as a US \"import\" buttressing against cultural and religious sensitivity, rather than a universal right and requirement, nothing will be solved.</p>",
  "<p>If only the politicians would tell us what they really think, we say. If only they'd drop the soundbites and the focus-group-tested messaging and give it to us straight. Two politicians did just that this week. They granted us an unimpeded look into their true souls \u2013 and it wasn't pretty.</p> <p>Nick Clegg was not one of them. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2012/sep/20/nick-clegg-apology-tuition-fees-video\" title=\"\">His apology</a> over his broken tuition fee promise was meant to look candid and genuine, but it was as much a made-for-video stunt as his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXw7yqHfxDI\" title=\"\">original pledge</a> \u2013 and, as one observer rightly noted, took the curious form of a husband saying \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JuliaHB1/status/248499548178239488\" title=\"\">sorry for my affair; next time I won't vow to be faithful</a>\".</p> <p>The act of unbridled honesty was committed instead by the chief whip Andrew Mitchell who, living up to his \"Thrasher\" nickname, gave a tongue-lashing to the police guarding Downing Street. Whether he called them \"f***ing plebs\" who ought to \"learn your f***ing place\", <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/politics/4549265/Andrew-Mitchell-insults-police-at-Downing-Street-by-calling-them-fing-plebs.html#ixzz277DyayRq\" title=\"\">as the Sun had it</a>, we may never know. But that Mitchell insulted men ready to risk their lives to protect him and his colleagues was confirmed when the chief whip telephoned the officer concerned to apologise.</p> <p>The damage will linger, suggesting this is what the government's most senior enforcer \u2013 a millionaire said to live as expensively as he was educated \u2013 really thinks: that the police are glorified servants who, if regrettably exempt these days from the obligation to bow and touch the forelock, ought at least to do what they're told by their betters. It is an ugly impression, one fast congealing in the public imagination as the defining feature of this government's top echelon: that they are a rich, over-privileged clique, out of touch with everyday life and with a nasty streak they cannot conceal.</p> <p>Luckily for David Cameron, Mitchell has next to no public profile and is in a job that requires even less. Unless more police officers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/21/andrew-mitchell-police-tirade-labour\" title=\"\">demand his head</a>, he can be quietly disappeared. Across the Atlantic, the Republican party's problem is somewhat graver. The man whose true self was exposed this week is their nominee for president, Mitt Romney.</p> <p>It bears repeating that, as former Reagan speechwriter <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/peggynoonan/2012/09/18/time-for-an-intervention/?mod=e2tw\" title=\"\">Peggy Noonan puts it</a>, this was meant to be the year \"the Republican presidential candidate almost couldn't lose\". Barack Obama has disappointed, his poll rating usually below 50% with unemployment stubbornly above 8%. A halfway decent, generic Republican should win this comfortably. The election is Romney's to lose \u2013 and he is doing his best to make that happen.</p> <p>The killer blow may well prove to be the <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/watch-full-secret-video-private-romney-fundraiser\" title=\"\">secret video of his appearance</a> before a closed-door, $50,000-a-plate dinner for donors recorded in May but which surfaced this week. Much has been made of Romney's casual writing off of 47% of the American population as parasites who pay no income tax, see themselves as \"victims\", and believe the government owes them a living \u2013 to paraphrase only slightly \u2013 who will never vote for him anyway. As strategies for winning votes go, condemning half the electorate \u2013 including the millions of pensioners and veterans who receive benefits \u2013 is certainly novel.</p> <p>The candidate's remarks on Middle East peace were not much more politic, attacking the Palestinians as bent on Israel's destruction and admitting that his game plan for the conflict would simply be to \"kick the ball down the field and hope that ultimately, somehow, something will happen\".</p> <p>But while these specifics are gobsmacking, it's the overall tone of Romney unplugged that is so striking. Read the <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/full-transcript-mitt-romney-secret-video#nodeal\" title=\"\">full transcript</a> and you realise that you are eavesdropping on a meeting of the 1%, a conclave of the cosseted super-rich of which Romney is so clearly a part.</p> <p>He begins with a quip about inheritance planning, which clearly resonates with his audience. He gets another laugh when he jokes about immigration, chuckling that if \"you have no skill or experience \u2026 you're welcome to cross the border and stay here for the rest of your life\". Romney goes on to voice the perennial, if improbable, complaint of the privileged white male: that life would be so much easier if he were fashionably ethnic. Recalling that his father was born in Mexico to American parents, he muses that \"had he been born of Mexican parents I'd have a better shot at winning this \u2026 it'd be helpful if they'd been Latino\".</p> <p>That's not the only instance of what is said to be a common feature of the extremely wealthy: self-pity. An audience member complains that people don't realise how hard it is for multimillionaires like them: \"We kill ourselves, we don't work a nine to five. We're away from our families five days&#xa0;a&#xa0;week.\" Romney shouldn't apologise for his wealth, they tell him,&#xa0;he should be proud of it. But \"I'm as poor as a church mouse\", the candidate replies \u2013 and, in that company, he might well be.</p> <p>The Romney caught on video could not be less appealing, a Monty Burns caricature of a heartless plutocrat. The persona his aides have worked so hard to construct is left shattered into a thousand glassy pieces. They brag of his devotion as a husband. But at the fundraiser he speaks of his wife in terms that are icily transactional: \"We use Ann sparingly right now, so that people don't get tired of her.\"</p> <p>The word \"gaffe\" doesn't do justice to this. Gaffe is adding an \"e\" to the end of the word \"potato\", <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/frenzy/quayle3.htm\" title=\"\">as Dan Quayle did</a>, or forgetting the third government department you plan to close, which <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-15680178\" title=\"\">undid Romney's Republican rival Rick Perry</a>. This is gaffe as diagnosed by the commentator Michael Kinsley: when the mask slips and a politician accidentally tells the truth about themselves.</p> <p>Something similar happened to Obama four years ago when \u2013 also at a closed-door fundraiser \u2013 he mused on those <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/14/barackobama.uselections2008\" title=\"\">small-town voters who get \"bitter\"</a> at the state of their lives and so \"cling to guns or religion\". He would never have put it like that publicly, but it exposed an Ivy League condescension that was real.</p> <p>Such moments are not trivial but illuminating. The Romney tape, for example, reveals an Ayn Rand, survival-of-the-fittest philosophy, pitting <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/michael-gerson-a-republican-mind-set-without-promise/2012/09/20/798901f8-0344-11e2-91e7-2962c74e7738_story.html\" title=\"\">the \"makers\" against the \"takers\"</a>, that is crucial to understanding today's Republican party. And somehow, for all the complaints of control and artifice, the much-derided modern presidential campaign rarely fails to produce such moments of clarity. Yes, it is flawed \u2013 both too long and too costly. But it provides a priceless service, a scrutiny from which no candidate can hide.</p> <p>Being president \"reveals who you are,\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/04/michelle-obama-democratic-convention-live\" title=\"\">Michelle Obama told the Democratic convention</a> earlier this month. Running for president does the same thing. The trouble for Mitt Romney is&#xa0;that not many Americans like what they see.</p> <p><em>Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/j_freedland?tw_i=244868341578211328&amp;tw_e=screenname&amp;tw_p=tweetembed\" title=\"\"><em>@j_freedland</em></a></p>",
  "<p>A joint Franco-British investigation team has been set up to streamline inquiries into the deaths of a British family in the Alps as a French prosecutor admitted that bureaucratic obstacles had at times made progress \"extremely slow\".</p> <p>Surrey police and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said the unit would help improve co-operation in the inquiries into the killings of British engineer Saad al-Hilli, 50, his 47-year-old wife, Ikbal, her mother, Suhaila al-Allaf, 74, and Frenchman Sylvain Mollier, 45.</p> <p>The four victims were found shot dead on a forest road near the village of Chevaline on 5 September. The Hillis' seven-year-old daughter, Zeinab, had been shot and badly beaten, and her four-year-old sister, Zeena, was found hours later hiding beneath her mother's skirts.</p> <p>Despite the work of dozens of police officers on both side of the Channel, efforts to get to the bottom of the mysterious attack have yielded no suspects.</p> <p>Outlining the function of the joint team, public prosecutor Eric Maillaud said the inquiry had been hindered by differences between the French and British judicial processes.</p> <p>\"There is a shock of legal cultures which is making everything extremely slow,\" he told AFP.</p> <p>He said the team \u2013 which would bring officers from Surrey police, representatives of the CPS and gendarmes from nearby Chamb\u00e9ry under the authority of two French investigating magistrates \u2013 would work \"as if they were in one country\" and \"as if there was no longer a border\".</p> <p>In a joint statement, Detective Chief Superintendent Adrian Harper and Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor for CPS South East Jaswant Narwal said: \"The establishment today of the Joint Investigation Team marks a significant step forward in progressing the murder investigation, enabling closer co-operation and greater understanding between the UK and French authorities, with a single focus of bringing to justice those responsible for these heinous crimes.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for Surrey police said: \"We've had a very good ongoing relationship with the French authorities from the word go, but because it's an inquiry that's over two jurisdictions, that brings with it its own challenges. Having the [team] simplifies the way we can make our inquiries over here.\"</p> <p>In response to a claim by Maillaud that it had rejected several official requests for co-operation, the Home Office said in a statement it had \"co-operated fully with the French authorities\" on the case.</p> <p>Since 2000, EU member states have been able to form joint teams under the control of the EU judicial co-operation body Eurojust for specific investigations that stretch across two or more countries.</p> <p>Maillaud said this latest initiative would be the 25th established involving France but only the second between France and Britain. He suggested it could ultimately be expanded to cover other European countries such as Spain, where Saad al-Hilli's late father lived, Sweden, where Allaf lived, or Switzerland and Italy, where the killer or killers may have fled.</p> <p>Investigators on the case have said they are pursuing three main lines of inquiry into the deaths.</p> <p>The first centred on an alleged family feud after reports surfaced that Saad al-Hilli had been involved in a dispute with his brother over their father's inheritance. His brother, Zaid, has vehemently denied the reports. The second concerned Hilli's work as an engineer for different companies, and the third involved his roots in Iraq, where he was born and where he is believed to have returned two years ago in a bid to recoup some family assets.</p>",
  "<p>Fifteen people were killed and nearly 200 injured in Pakistan on Friday as angry protests that have raged all week against a blasphemous US film mocking the prophet MUhammad continued to engulf the Muslim world.</p> <p>There were violent demonstrations in Pakistan after the government took the questionable decision to declare a national holiday to allow people to rally against the video. Tens of thousands took to the streets in all major cities. Many protests descended into serious unrest. Protesters threw objects at police, who retaliated with teargas canisters and live rounds.</p> <p>The provocative US trailer, Innocence of Muslims, also prompted protests in at least half a dozen other countries on Friday, with demonstrators burning American flags and effigies of Barack Obama. The unrest capped a tumultuous 10 days that has seen the murder of the US ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens, in what the White House says was a well-plotted terrorist attack, possibly linked to al-Qaida.</p> <p>The film has caused a deep crisis for the US administration. It has also provoked a pained discussion in Europe and the US over the boundaries of free speech. Several of the latest protests were also directed at France after the satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo published fresh Muhammad caricatures.</p> <p>France took a tough line on protests on Friday, with the interior minister, Manuel Valls, saying no demonstrations against the cartoons would be allowed. Paris closed its embassy in Egypt, where a few dozen protesters congregated on Friday. Germany also shut its Egypt mission.</p> <p>But it was Pakistan that saw the most inflammatory scenes. Some 195 people were reportedly wounded in the cities of Peshawar, Karachi and Islamabad \u2013 with nine killed in Karachi and four in Peshawar. One of the Karachi dead was a policeman. He was apparently killed in an exchange of gunfire with protesters. Unknown gunmen also shot and wounded three other policemen.</p> <p>In Peshawar, the frontier city close to the Afghan border, mobs attacked buildings and set fire to cinemas. One victim, Muhammad Amir, was the driver of broadcast truck owned by the television network ARY. He was hit by police fire. He later died of his wounds in hospital but not before the television station broadcast continuous loops of him in obvious pain being attended to in an emergency room.</p> <p>In Karachi rioters torched police vans, looted shops and even attacked the coastal port city's fire brigade. For a second day running in Islamabad, the normally sedate capital, violence was concentrated in front of the five-star Serena hotel,situated on a road that leads to the entrance to the fenced-off diplomatic quarter where the US embassy is located.</p> <p>\"America has challenged the Muslim nation by making this movie,\" said a 19-year-old called Mohammad Fayyaz, who kept his face covered as he joined the violence in the capital. He added: \"We will not go until the man who made the film is hanged.\"</p> <p>The White House has made desperate efforts over the past week to defuse the protests. Speaking on television and radio adverts, the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, has emphasised that the US government had nothing to do with the film's production. The acting US ambassador in Pakistan, Richard Hoagland, met with government officials to once again to reiterate that the US government \"condemned this video's content and its message\".</p> <p>But the US's vigorous campaign of public diplomacy appears not to have worked. In many places in Pakistan, crowds were able to break through barricades placed in their way by police. Images streaming in from all over the country on Pakistan's frenetic cable news channels got steadily grimmer as what the government had billed as \"love of prophet Muhammad day\" wore on and protests descended into battles and looting.</p> <p>Mobile phone networks had been turned off in 15 cities in an effort to frustrate the ability of crowds to organise themselves, but it appeared to have no effect and services were restored well before the originally advertised time of 6pm. In Lahore, the grand colonial era Mall Road was the setting for skirmishes by demonstrators who also attempted to approach the US consulate in the city.</p> <p>In Iraq about 3,000 protesters condemned the film as well as the French caricatures. The protest in the southern city of Basra was organised by Iranian-backed Shia groups. Some protesters raised Iraqi flags and posters of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, while chanting \"death to America\".</p> <p>In the Sri Lankan capital of Colombo, about 2,000 Muslims burned effigies of Obama and US flags at a protest after Friday prayers. In Bangladesh, over 2,000 people marched through the streets of the capital, Dhaka, to express outrage at the film. Small and mostly orderly protests were also held in Malaysia and Indonesia.</p> <p>Thousands also gathered in Lebanon's Bekaa valley for the latest in a series of protest rallies organised by the militant group Hezbollah. There was also unrest in Indian-administered Kashmir. Police imposed a day-long curfew in the Kashmir valley, and in the main city, Srinagar, police chased away protesters. Authorities in the region also temporarily blocked mobile and internet services.</p> <p>Critics in Pakistan lambasted the decision of the government to make Friday a national holiday. They said hardline religious parties, many of them fronts for banned terrorist organisations, hijacked the day off as a chance to show off their street power.</p> <p>Raza Rumi, a prominent analyst and newspaper columnist, said the government had chosen a policy of appeasement. \"The government is under immense pressure to appear as Islamic and as pious as anyone,\" he said. \"But it could have chosen alternative strategy of engaging with the various religious groups and launched a public campaign to educate people rather than letting them take to the streets.\"</p> <p>Earlier in the day, Pakistan's prime minister, Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, addressed a gathering of politicians and top clerics in Islamabad. While he called for peaceful protests, he also used language likely to inflame the many protests that have claimed the video is part of a plot involving Jewish, Israeli and US interests. \"It is ironical that denial of holocaust is considered a crime but no consideration is paid to the feelings of Muslims,\" he said. \"I hope the international community and Islamic world will be successful in preventing such things.\"</p> <p>If the intention of the government was to burnish its Islamic credentials in the run-up to the election in six months, many protesters were not convinced. \"[President Asif Ali] Zardari is a man with no grace, he should resign,\" said Tabarak Lateef, a 22-year-old protester in Islamabad. \"Our rulers are traitors, they are American slaves and they should be ashamed of themselves.\"</p>",
  "<p>How is Frankfurt different from London as a financial centre? Over the past week I have tried to ask as many insiders across Frankfurt as possible. A picture emerges of a city where finance is simply a job, not an all-encompassing identity or a way of life.</p> <p>Meanwhile, life in Frankfurt does appear almost offensively good. \"When I first got here, I just couldn't believe how small it was,\" said a British recent arrival who worked in the City for years. \"You think, this is Germany's or even Europe's financial centre. You assume it's very big. It really isn't.\"</p> <p>As a city, Frankfurt is a tenth the size of London, and in spite of the skyscrapers, its financial sector is vastly smaller too.</p> <p>A trader in his late 20s described dealing with a London trading floor: \"I call and speak to Tom. Next time, someone else answers the phone, and next time, someone else again. These places are just huge.\"</p> <p>Add to this the enormous turnover. \"In Frankfurt you've got people who have been trading particular Pfandbriefe [bonds] for 25 years. That's what they do. In London, people are fired easily and hired easily. Frankfurt doesn't have that recruitment and headhunting culture.\" You have traders and dealmakers working in Frankfurt, obviously. But all the truly huge deals and trades are happening in London.</p> <p>Another trader said: \"In Frankfurt there simply aren't any 24-year-olds with a $10m bonus. You only need a few of those, and public opinion is affected by their excesses.\"</p> <p>A pivotal event for the city came a few years ago when Deutsche Bank moved the headquarters for its investment bank \u2013 with its bonus-heavy activities around financial markets and dealmaking \u2013 to London. Several people in both London and Frankfurt claimed that if Deutsche Bank Frankfurt was \"a family\", London headquarters was like \"a boxing ring\".</p> <p>Frankfurt gets filtered for testosterone, said one banker. \"Genuinely ambitious Germans go to London. Meanwhile any expats who decide to settle down here do so for the quality of life.\" Indeed, walking around town and seeing German pedestrians wait before a red traffic light without a car in sight, it's hard to imagine a Master of the Universe setting up camp here. Insiders use terms such as sedate, steady and stable for Frankfurt.</p> <p>Bankers in Frankfurt get paid significantly less, all the way up to the CEO, and they pay considerably more taxes. Meanwhile finance is far less controversial, it appears, and I did not find the sense of victimhood and siege mentality you see among quite a few bankers in London. \"Finance in Frankfurt is more knitted into the wider fabric of the economy,\" said one financial analyst. \"You have the fair, it's a transport nexus and they have some real industry here. Finance is less of an end in itself.\" And the sector holds less clout. \"It's not like German bankers sit together and say: 'let's be modest',\" the analyst said. \"You have the same tendencies as in London. But German bankers operate in a different environment and the financial lobby gets less of what it wants.\"</p> <p>And then there is the quality of life. A newcomer to London myself, I began to get slightly annoyed over the course of the week by the raving over Frankfurt's superb cultural offerings, its forests nearby, the massive yet peaceful beer and wine festivals along the river. Drinking is not about release here, several Brits said, so you don't get the English excesses. Frankfurt airport is the size of Heathrow but only 15 minutes by car from the city centre. The Hauptbahnhof is a hub for the superfast Ice trains.</p> <p>The recently arrived Brit said: \"Here I can ride my bike to work, or walk there in 20 relaxing minutes. Nobody in my office has lunch at their desks. The ones with kids live out of town in the <em>Speckgurtel </em>(\"bacon belt\"), and they need to drive maybe half an hour or so. Because the commute isn't such an epic struggle, people arrive at work in a different mindset. I imagine they must also come back to their families in a different mood.\"</p> <p>The trader in his late 20s agrees. \"London salaries and bonuses are much higher. But in Frankfurt your money goes further, even after the higher taxes. Housing is far cheaper, there are no crazy school fees, and we have subsidised daycare.\"</p> <p>Sounding almost smug, he added: \"I like to tell my boss, if you want to send me to London, you are going have to pay me four times as much.\"</p>",
  "<p>Sometimes, there is a myth that simply won't die. It just gets repeated over and over, without much reason. Meet the <a href=\"http://therightnewz.com/?p=9543\">50% rule</a>: this is the idea that if an incumbent is under 50%, then he could lose because undecideds break towards the challenger.</p> <p>Barack Obama is <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/ 2012-general-election-romney-vs-obama\">polling</a> at about 48% and up by about 3 percentage points right now. The 50% rule says Obama may be leading, but may not win if the election were today. The truth of the matter is that an Obama lead of 3 percentage points, and being at 48%, is a fine position for an incumbent. Here's why:</p> <p><strong>1). The winner of this election is likely only going <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ JoeLenski/status/246333440247595008\">to need 49%</a> of the vote</strong></p> <p>It may get lost in the daily back and forth of the campaign, but there are other candidates besides Obama and Mitt Romney running.</p> <p>Former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson is running on the Libertarian ticket, and is arguably the most respectable third party campaign since Ralph Nader in 2000. He is already <a href=\"http://www.lp.org/2012-ballot-access\">on the ballot</a> in 48 of the 50 states and is in position to be on the ballot in all 50. Considering that the ideologically similar Ron Paul <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2012f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=2\">doubled</a> his primary vote from <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2008&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=2\">2008</a>, don't be surprised if Johnson doubles the <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2008&amp;minper=0&amp;f=1&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0\">2008 Libertarian party performance</a>. That puts him on track for about 0.8% of the national vote.</p> <p>The Constitution party's Virgil Goode has less ballot access, but is certainly more impressive than his party 2008 candidate, Charles Baldwin. Goode is a former congressman who may play a <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/meet-virgil-goode-immgration-hard-liner-sink-romney/story?id=17212388\">spoiler role in Virginia</a>. He could pick up 0.2-0.3% of the national vote.</p> <p>Don't forget the liberal third party candidates. You can probably add in another 0.2-0.3% for the Green party's nominee, <a href=\"http://www.jillstein.org/\">Jill Stein</a>. And who really knows what percentage of the vote comedian and Peace and Freedom party candidate <a href=\"http://politics.heraldtribune.com/2012/09/17/roseanne-barr-to-join-11 other-presidential-candidates-on-florida-ballot/\">Roseanne Barr</a> will get? Plus, there are many other minor parties and write-ins.</p> <p>The bottom line is that it's quite possible that the third party vote may add up to 2%.</p> <p>Obama's certainly at 48%, and a number of polls have him at 49% or higher. Even if you believe that 80% of undecideds go for the challenger, Obama would still collect more than 1 percentage point overall from undecideds to put him over the 49% threshold.</p> <p><strong>2). Historically, undecideds don't break towards the challenger</strong></p> <p>Back in 2004, I remember confidently strutting around thinking that John Kerry would do better than polls had him \u2013 because of this notion that undecideds break towards the challenger. I got a good smack of reality when the results came in. Kerry did not do substantially better than his percentage in the pre-election <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2004/president/us/general_election_bush_vs_kerry-939.html\">polls</a>. In fact, it was George W Bush who slightly over-performed.</p> <p>Studies have found that 2004 was no aberration. Nate Silver <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/22/do-presidential-polls-break-toward-challengers/\">examined</a> September polls and compared them to the November results. He found that while challengers generally do better, it's not by as much as you might think \u2013 nor why you would think.</p> <p>It turns out that whichever candidate is trailing (challenger or incumbent) cuts the leading candidate's edge by about 30% from September polls. That means if an incumbent is leading by 2.5 points, you'd expect him to win by about 1.8 percentage points in November. Because the number of points gained by the challenger is proportional to the incumbent's lead, we often see gains greater than 1 point as challengers are often behind by more than Romney is right now.</p> <p>Once we get to the final polls, both candidates should, on average, do about as well as the polls have them placing.</p> <p><strong>3). 2012 undecided voters do not overwhelmingly look like Romney supporters</strong></p> <p>The pool of undecided voters is likely less than 10% of the electorate at this point. Indeed, with a fairly stark choice between the candidates, it's a wonder how the percentage is that high.</p> <p>The profile of the undecideds turns out to match reasonable assumptions. Undecideds <a href=\"http://argojournal.blogspot.com/2012/07/poll-watch-rasmussen-r-2012.html\">don't approve</a> of Obama's job performance, but they <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/blog/electionate/105743/romney-undecided-voters\">hate Romney</a>. They <a href=\"http://about.civicscience.com/blog/2012/8/29/the-mystery-of-the-undecided-voter.html\">don't watch</a> the news and tend to be independents. Undecideds don't sit around forming partisan opinions all day, because they tend to have better things to do.</p> <p>They are the type of voters who could be persuaded by a television ad. Obama has <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/17/the-ad-wars-obama-has-been-outspending-romney-and-the-superpacs/\">more ads airing</a> in the swing states than Romney does. While Romney and his fellow Republicans may have more ads in the final months than Obama and his allies will, that advantage <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/09/17/will_ad_fatigue_among_voters_mute_gops_cash_edge__115468.html\">won't be overwhelming</a>. There is also likely to be a point of saturation, with diminishing returns for the extra airplay.</p> <p>Moreover, ask yourself this question: do you choose the product you don't like but know, or the product you like even less and don't know? We saw this formula play out in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/apr/20/2012-douche-v-turd-election\">many state-wide races</a> in 2010. In at least three elections, the incumbent had negative net approval ratings and the challenger had negative net favorable ratings. In all these races, the incumbent managed to survive.</p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <p>President Obama is in fine shape given the current polling data, even though he isn't at 50% support. If the polling aggregates continue to show him leading by a 2 percentage-point or greater margin at the end of the week (that is, after the fading of the convention bounces), then he's going to be a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/20/post-convention-polling-obama-consolidates-lead\">clear favorite to win in November</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Chayya Gaikwad grew up in a women's refuge in Mumbai. She now works for an international bank. It wasn't a miracle that got her there. It was netball.</p> <p>Chhaya, 23, joined the <a href=\"http://goalprogramme.org\" title=\"\">Goal programme</a> as a teenager. Financed by Standard Chartered Bank, Goal gives girls from deprived backgrounds the opportunity to learn a range of different sports with a qualified coach. Running alongside the sessions are lessons in life skills, such as healthy eating, leadership and financial literacy.</p> <p>\"Netball builds health and confidence and team spirit, and teaches us to work with all sorts of different people,\" says Chhaya, who proceeded through the programme's ranks to become an assistant coach and finally an intern at Standard Chartered.</p> <p>Sport is now <a href=\"http://www.sportanddev.org\" title=\"\">widely accepted</a> as a powerful vehicle in the delivery of development goals, be they public health, education or social inclusion. Lecture kids in a classroom and a fraction of the information sticks. Introduce a ball into the equation and you suddenly have yourself a large and attentive audience.</p> <p>That's <a href=\"http://www.righttoplay.com\" title=\"\">Right to Play's</a> experience, at least. The Toronto-based development charity provides a network of 12,000 local coaches in 20 countries. Their sports-based activities are all geared to address specific local issues, ranging from gender equality in the Middle East to basic literacy in Peru.</p> <p>Will Morgan, senior fundraising manager at the charity, explains: \"At the end of every activity, there's a discussion facilitated by the coach in which the children are taught to reflect on what they've just done, connect it to their everyday life and apply it in the future. That's how you get long-term behaviour change.\"</p> <p>The facts bear that out. A study of Right to Play's sport interventions among refugee communities in Uganda found that 84% of participants now sleep under a mosquito net. The national average is closer to 10%. Attitudes can shift too. More than 90% of Right to Play's young participants in Uganda believe children with HIV or AIDS should be allowed to attend school. Only 54% of non-participants agree.</p> <h2>Mutual benefit </h2> <p>So how does business fit into the mix? First, there's the issue of incentive to consider. Corporate reputation, employee engagement and health, and license to operate are just some of the notable wins for companies.</p> <p>\"On top of that, sport can add to the efficiency, reach or impact of any kind of corporate community initiative\", says Joe Phelan, a spokesperson for the International Business Leaders Forum (IBLF), which has published <a href=\"http://www.sportanddev.org/en/toolkit/partnerships/benefits_of_partnering_with_ngos/shared_goals/\" title=\"\">two reports</a> on the business case for sport for development.</p> <p>Recruitment represents another big pull. \"From the bank's perspective, the benefit [of Goal] is in creating a talent pool,\" says Chris James, head of talent acquisition at Standard Chartered, South Asia. He's not wrong. Chhaya is just one of 18,865 girls involved in the Goal programme throughout India, Nigeria, China, Jordan and Zambia. The bank aims to reach 80,000 more.</p> <p>Having empowered and informed women in the markets where it operates is not lost on Standard Chartered. The programme's financial literacy component \"makes perfect sense\" to a bank, says the firm's head of sustainability, Mark Devadason. No surprise then that the Goal webpage offers a click-through tab to the bank's advisory services for women in business.</p> <p>David Wheldon is equally frank about the potential business upside. Managing director for brand, marketing and citizenship at UK bank Barclays, he points to young people's appropriation of \"highly employable skills\" through sport, such as teamwork, leadership, problem solving and communication. \"[These are] precisely the skills that an employer such as Barclays looks for in potential employees,\" he states.</p> <p>It's not a one-way street, however. Development charities can gain from business input too. Corporate cash is one welcome asset. But development NGOs can benefit from companies' professionalism and technical expertise as well, says Pippa Satchwell Smith, a Zimbabwe-based sport-for-development expert.</p> <p>Tapping into businesses' global networks can be invaluable too, she adds. Take sporting superstars. As sponsor of the Premier League, for example, Barclays has access to some of the best-known sporting faces on the planet. The same is true for the likes of Nike, Adidas and the world's other major sports sponsors.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.laureus.com/foundation\" title=\"\">Laureus Sport for Good Foundation</a> foundation is putting such celebrity to good effect. The charity has an academy that comprises 46 of the world's greatest sporting legends.</p> <p>Think Viv Richards, Michael Johnson, Martina Navratilova. Laureus arranges visits for them to its 104 projects around the world. So last year, for example, tennis star Boris Becker popped into a football school in Haiti. Next week, athlete Edwin Moses is in Brazil to visit a youth boxing project in the favelas of Rio.</p> <p>These are sporting icons that children immediately know, says Ned Wills, the foundation's director. \"They [sports stars] can not only inspire the kids on the ground, but they can also highlight the huge impact that sport is having \u2026 and promote the value of these programmes to new audiences.\"</p> <h2>Lasting legacy </h2> <p>Nick Keller is a passionate advocate for involving companies in development through sport. Yet as founder of <a href=\"http://www.beyondsport.org/\" title=\"\">Beyond Sport</a>, a global charity that promotes sport as a vehicle for social change, he's sceptical of corporate philanthropy. \"A very positive approach is when the actual expertise of the business is actually helpful to the NGO \u2026 and also something that fits into a business's objective, because then it's not so whimsical\", he states.</p> <p>Don't go it alone. That's Keller's top-line message to companies. So he praises Standard Chartered, which won this year's Corporate Award at the Beyond Sport Awards, for its tie-up with <a href=\"http://www.netball.org/Netball.aspx?id=98\" title=\"\">global netball association IFNA</a>. Barclays' network of well-managed, grassroots partnerships in its <a href=\"http://group.barclays.com/about-barclays/citizenship/our-programmes/community-programmes/barclays-spaces-for-sports\" title=\"\">Spaces for Sport programme</a> is likewise commended.</p> <p>\"Good partnerships come in different shapes and sizes,\" Keller states. \"But what you don't want is a corporation trying to deliver on the ground. You want it to be working with a community partner that really understands its stuff.\"</p> <p>These kind of deeply rooted partnerships are particularly important when it comes to securing long-term developmental benefits from large-scale sporting events. This so-called <a href=\"http://www.sportanddev.org/en/newsnviews/highlighted_initiative/social_legacy_of_london_2012_olympics/index.cfm?uPage=3\" title=\"\">\"social legacy\"</a> is top-of-mind now the Olympics have passed.

  "<p>It is high time Britain left the ailing EU and its burdensome regulations and embraced trade with fast-growing emerging economies. That was the argument put forward by Nigel Farage at his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/sep/21/ukip-conference-farage-speech-live-blog2?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">keynote speech</a> this morning at the Ukip conference. It's an argument that also chimes with a growing body of opinion about the EU's diminishing importance for British trade, with <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2201876/UKs-non-EU-exports-surges-time-high-firms-sell-13-2billion-goods-nations-Europe-month.html\" title=\"\">recent trading statistics</a> showing that Britain's non-EU exports have risen to their highest levels since records began in 1998 while exports to the beleaguered eurozone continue to fall. However, the idea that Britain's economic prospects would actually improve were it to leave the EU is deeply misguided.</p> <p>Significantly, the EU remains the favoured export destination for the small and medium-sized enterprises that form the backbone of the British economy, and which are essential for an export-led recovery and a move away from Britain's over-reliance on the financial sector. A <a href=\"http://www.fsb.org.uk/policy/assets/fsb_exporting_web.pdf\" title=\"\">report</a> by the Federation of Small Businesses found that 87% of its members export to the European Economic Area, compared to less than 13% exporting to each of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRIC\" title=\"\">Bric</a> economies. Meanwhile the British Chambers of Commerce's <a href=\"http://www.britishchambers.org.uk/press-office/press-releases/smaller-firms-need-more-support-to-trade-with-high-growth-markets,-says-bcc.html\" title=\"\">annual survey</a> found that it is overwhelmingly large firms who are expanding trade with major emerging markets, while smaller businesses see the EU as providing the best opportunities for export growth.</p> <p>This is because most small firms lack the financial and human resources required to overcome the many challenges presented by emerging markets: language barriers, foreign legal systems, high tariffs and intellectual property theft. More fundamentally, low transport costs and rapid, visa-free travel make exporting to Europe far more manageable. A business employing fewer than 10 people can't afford to send an employee out to China for a week to meet potential partners, let alone come to grips with the Chinese bureaucracy and legal system. Exporting to the Brics therefore remains largely an elite affair, available only to those truly global firms who can afford the necessary armies of lawyers, accountants and translators.</p> <p>While small firms have made some inroads into emerging markets, notably <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2012/aug/28/india-exporting-small-business\" title=\"\">in India</a>, they have tended to remain reliant on government assistance or costly intermediaries. The EU thus remains vital as an affordable and hassle-free export destination.</p> <p>Undeniably, we are seeing a profound restructuring of the global economy, and as the relative importance of Europe diminishes it is natural that British firms will increasingly seek to exploit new opportunities in emerging markets such as the Brics.</p> <p>Importantly though, the EU can often act as a stepping stone for smaller firms, allowing them to expand the scale of their business in a secure and open environment before attempting to enter more difficult markets. The single market also allows firms to easily forge links with businesses on the continent, which can then be used as a springboard to open up new prospects elsewhere. For example, <a href=\"http://www.aidanstradling.co.uk/workareas.htm\" title=\"\">one small consultancy firm I spoke to</a> has helped micro businesses from the north-east of England pair up with their counterparts in Poland and Lithuania to then penetrate the Russian market. Similar opportunities abound, for example through the close trading relations between Spain and Mexico or Portugal and Brazil, and the <a href=\"http://www.kooperation-international.de/fileadmin/public/cluster/Xuzhou/GermanBusinessStudy.pdf\" title=\"\">significant expansion</a> of small German firms into China. By forging partnerships with European businesses and learning from their successes, British firms will be better placed to overcome existing barriers and expand into emerging markets. Instead of perceiving there to be a stark choice between trading with the EU or with the rest of the world, we should be seeing Europe as complementary to our <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/9502325/Britain-can-still-profit-from-global-trade-while-remaining-in-the-EU.html\" title=\"\">global trading strategy</a>.</p> <p>Tariff barriers remain one of the biggest concerns for small businesses, meaning the negotiation of free trade agreements is one of the most important opportunities for future growth. The EU already has free trade agreements in place with 45 countries, including a new deal signed with South Korea in March which will bring an estimated <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17508360\" title=\"\">\u00a3500m a year</a> to the British economy. Further trade agreements are currently being negotiated with India and Canada, with potential trade deals with the <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/06/20/uk-eu-us-trade-idUKBRE85J1FY20120620\" title=\"\">US</a> and <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/18/us-eu-trade-japan-idUSBRE86H0HD20120718\" title=\"\">Japan</a> in the pipeline. If the UK left the EU, we would have to start negotiating these trade deals from scratch. Moreover, without the weight of the world's largest common market of 500 million wealthy consumers behind us, we would end up with far less favourable terms when negotiating with the world's economic superpowers.</p> <p>There are many other benefits accrued to small businesses from EU membership, including access to credit from the European Investment Bank, as well as <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/foi_eumembership_fdi.pdf\" title=\"\">foreign investments</a> which are often motivated by the UK's proximity and access to the single market. Indeed, some studies estimate foreign direct investment into the UK could <a href=\"http://www.moneyweek.com/news-and-charts/economics/uk/should-britain-pull-out-of-the-eu-55616\" title=\"\">fall by over a third</a> if it leaves the EU.</p> <p>On the one major aspect of EU membership which is a significant burden on small businesses, cumbersome EU regulations and red tape, there has been some <a href=\"http://www.enforbusiness.com/news/eu-red-tape-reprieve-small-business-20115961\" title=\"\">much-needed progress</a>, and there are <a href=\"http://www.neurope.eu/article/meps-want-less-red-tape-small-businesses\" title=\"\">further plans</a> to exempt small businesses from all EU regulations unless they can be proven beneficial. There are also significant benefits to be gained for small firms from plans boost e-commerce in services by expanding the single market to <a href=\"http://www.euractiv.com/innovation-enterprise/european-smes-need-digital-singl-analysis-512320\" title=\"\">digital sector</a>.</p> <p>So despite the ongoing problems in the eurozone, Britain's future prosperity continues to be inextricably linked to our trading relationship with Europe. Tellingly, a recent <a href=\"http://www.enterpriseeuropeeast.org.uk/eox/news/index.asp?newsid=510\" title=\"\">poll</a> found that while largely opposing further political integration, almost 90% of UK businesses continue to support EU membership. As conference season begins and an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/21/ukip-tory-deal-eu-referendum\" title=\"\">eventual referendum</a> on EU membership draws ever closer, it is these pragmatic businesses we should be listening to, not the irrational voice of Ukip.</p>",
  "<p>A high court judge has ordered that more than 1,000 international students at London Metropolitan University should be allowed to start their courses on Monday pending the outcome of a legal battle over their future.</p> <p>But Mr Justice Irwin refused to quash the home secretary's decision to suspend the university's licence to sponsor overseas students, saying that it should not be able to recruit a fresh wave of students in January until the matter has been settled legally. The judge granted permission for the university to launch a full-scale legal challenge to the revocation of its highly trusted status by the UK Border Agency (UKBA) to sponsor international students on 29 August.</p> <p>The decision left in limbo more than 2,000 overseas students who were studying or were about to start courses at the north London university and who faced the stark choice of finding another university place or leaving the country.</p> <p>Irwin said he was moving to protect students from outside the European Economic Association area who were already in Britain and whose immigration status was in order. The temporary order covers more than 1,000 students already on LMU courses or who are starting on Monday, but many remain unhappy at their treatment.</p> <p>Seyda Yilmaz, 20, from Istanbul, who is about to start the third year of a \u00a310,000-a-year journalism course, said: \"I was told I needed a new visa, even though I have a valid visa until 2013. It's been a month now that we've been having these difficulties and I've been trying to find a new institution. I have found one, and if I can change my university, then I really want to, because I don't want to stay with London Met, with all these problems.\"</p> <p>The judge also ordered that those who had decided to transfer to other universities should not lose out financially. The Home Office has already said it would allow a further group of 400 students to complete their courses. The exact number reprieved was not clear on Friday night as the details were still being negotiated.</p> <p>Professor Malcolm Gillies, vice-chancellor of London Metropolitan, said he was delighted by the \"very good news\", adding: \"It's an important issue and there are lessons for all to learn.\"</p> <p>A third year student, Donna Marie Winstanley, from Hong Kong told the BBC: \"It's really good. I have not applied to any other universities. I had a feeling that the university was going to win the case. Most of my classmates have already applied. I didn't want to pay any more money. I had already paid \u00a316,000 in fees for my first two years.''</p> <p>The judge rejected legal arguments from the university's lawyers that the home secretary, Theresa May, had acted disproportionately, or was not justified in revoking its overseas students licence.</p> <p>But he did accept it was \"just arguable\" that she had acted unfairly in not allowing the university sufficient time to respond to UKBA concerns before suspending its licence. He said a full legal hearing was needed to test the university's claim that the decision had been taken under guidance that had not been approved by parliament or referred to anywhere in the immigration rules.</p> <p>The university's counsel, Richard Gordon QC, said because of this, there was a strong prima facie case that the UKBA's decision was unlawful. \"The financial impact on the university, and on its reputation and good will, are enormous. The impact on students' education, financial position and the disruption to their lives is extremely significant,\" he said.</p> <p>He added: \"It is not easy to see how, when the UKBA can't point to any [current] student who is in breach of immigration control requirements, how - with a decision that affects huge numbers of innocent students - the threat to immigration control has justified so draconian a decision as revocation or indeed suspension.\"</p> <p>But Lisa Giovannetti QC, for the Home Office, said it could not be suggested that LMU was not made aware what the concerns were as the university had been aware for \"months and months\" that its systems simply did not comply with sponsorship requirements.</p> <p>It was not suggested that LMU had deliberately breached the regulations, and it had made attempts to put things right, but had been unable to do that effectively, she told the judge.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the UKBA said: \"UKBA agreed to allow existing genuine students to continue studying at the university until their course has ended or the end of the academic year, whichever is sooner, as long as they meet the right standards. But students who are here illegally and do not meet our immigration criteria will not be allowed to stay.</p> <p>\"Revoking the university's licence was the right course of action and we will continue to fight their challenge at the full hearing.\"</p> <p>The Home Office has said that action was taken after it found that 26 students out of a sample of 101 were studying at LMU even though they did not have leave to remain in Britain. It also claimed that the lack of required monitoring meant there was no proof that students were turning up to lectures in 142 of 250 (57%) of those sampled. LMU rejected claims of systemic failings and said the revocation decision was based on a highly flawed UKBA report.</p>",
  "<p>Violent anti-US demonstrations have erupted across Pakistan after a week of rising anger and the fateful decision by the government to declare a national day of protest against the US film that mocks Islam's prophet.</p> <p>Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of all major cities, with many protests descending into serious unrest that killed at least 15 people, injured around 120 and did significant damage to businesses.</p> <p>In street battles across the country, protesters threw objects at police, who retaliated with teargas canisters and live rounds, mostly shot into the air.</p> <p>Three people were killed in Peshawar, close to the Afghan border, as mobs attacked buildings, including a number of cinemas that were set on fire.</p> <p>One victim was the driver of a broadcast truck owned by the television network ARY who was caught in police fire. He later died of his wounds in hospital but not before the television station broadcast continuous loops of him in obvious pain being attended to in an emergency room.</p> <p>In many places crowds were able to break through barricades erected by police, who struggled to control mobs enraged by the blasphemous video Innocence of Muslims that sparked the crisis.</p> <p>Images streaming in from all over the country on Pakistan's cable news channels got steadily grimmer as what the government had billed as \"Love of Prophet Muhammad Day\" wore on and protests descended into street battles and looting.</p> <p>Mobile phone networks had been turned off in 15 cities in an effort to frustrate the ability of crowds to organise themselves, but it appeared to have no effect and services were restored well before the originally advertised time of 6pm.</p> <p>In Lahore the grand colonial-era Mall Road was the setting for skirmishes by demonstrators who also attempted to approach the US consulate in the city.</p> <p>In Karachi, where two people were killed, including a police officer, rioters torched police vans, looted shops and even attacked the port city's fire brigade.</p> <p>And for a second day running in the normally sedate capital of Islamabad violence was concentrated in front of the five-star Serena hotel, which is on a road that leads to the fenced entrance of the diplomatic quarter where the US embassy is located.</p> <p>While police succeeded in holding back the several thousand strong crowd they also battled to prevent more protesters entering the city from the south.</p> <p>\"America has challenged the Muslim nation by making this movie,\" said a 19-year-old called Mohammad Fayyaz, who kept his face covered as he joined the violence in the capital. \"We will not go until the man who made the film is hanged.\"</p> <p>The US embassy continued a vigorous campaign of public diplomacy, which in recent days has included television and radio adverts featuring the secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, emphasising that the US government had nothing to do with the production of the film.</p> <p>Yesterday the acting ambassador, Richard Hoagland, met government officials to once again reiterate that Washington \"condemned this video's content and its message\".</p> <p>Critics have lambasted the Pakistani government's decision to make Friday a national holiday, saying it was hijacked by hardline religious parties, many of them fronts for banned terrorist organisations, who used the national strike as a chance to demonstrate their street power.</p> <p>Raza Rumi, a prominent analyst and newspaper columnist, said the government had chosen a policy of appeasement.</p> <p>\"The government is under immense pressure to appear as Islamic and as pious as anyone,\" he said. \"But it could have chosen an alternative strategy of engaging with the various religious groups and launched a public campaign to educate people rather than letting them take to the streets.\"</p> <p>Earlier in the day the prime minister addressed a gathering of politicians and top clerics in Islamabad. He called for peaceful protests, but also used language likely to inflame the many protesters who have claimed the video is part of a plot involving Jewish, Israeli and US interest.</p> <p>\"It is ironical that denial of Holocaust is considered a crime but no consideration is paid to the feelings of Muslims,\" he said. \"I hope the international community and Islamic world will be successful in preventing such things.\"</p> <p>If the intention of the government was to burnish its Islamic credentials in the runup to an election in the next six months, many protesters were not convinced.</p> <p>\"[President Asif Ali] Zardari is a man with no grace, he should resign,\" said Tabarak Lateef, a 22-year-old protester in Islamabad. \"Our rulers are traitors, they are American slaves and they should be ashamed of themselves.\"</p>",
  "<p>As the new school year approaches in Mali, it is looking increasingly unlikely that hundreds of schools across the Islamist-controlled north that have been closed for several months will be reopening soon.</p> <p>Thousands of children have had their last school year ruined. When the rebel Tuareg MNLA took over the towns of Gao, Kidal and Timbuktu at the beginning of 2012, classes had already been disrupted by teachers on a prolonged strike. Then fighting broke out between the MNLA and Islamist rebels from AQMI, Ansar Dine and MUJAO, and schools were closed and parents kept their children away for safety. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/30/mali-adultery-stoning-radical-islamists\" title=\"\">The victorious Islamists went on to declare that they would impose sharia law</a> across the north, and called for the introduction of Qur'anic schools where girls and boys could not be taught together.</p> <p>Although a new national government was named by Mali's president, Dioncounda Traor\u00e9, in August, the new education ministry has so far been unable to do much to get children back in class.</p> <p>\"This is having an enormous impact on the children psychologically, and on the whole country. How can we train the next generation?\" says Maiga Dramane, head of basic education at the ministry of education. \"But how do you expect us to persuade someone who is pointing an AK47 at us that they should reopen a school?\"</p> <p>In addition to the closed schools, thousands of people have fled from the north \u2013 latest figures suggest at least 174,000 people have been internally displaced and more than 200,000 are in refugee camps in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jul/12/mali-refugees-burkina-faso-food-crisis\" title=\"\">Burkina Faso</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/video/2012/aug/15/niger-mali-refugee-crisis-video\" title=\"\">Niger</a> and Mauritania, all with little access to educational opportunities.</p> <p>But a few children have reached the capital, Bamako, and are now benefiting from remedial classes organised by Unicef and the Malian government. An estimated 12,000 displaced people are now living with their extended families in Bamako, and the classes are to support those young people who were supposed to sit their exams in the school year ending in July. The government has promised to make provisions for them to sit exams in October.</p> <p>\"When I heard about these new sessions I was in Mauritania, but I told my family I was going to Bamako,\" says 19-year-old Lala Zeinab Elmouany, originally from Timbuktu. \"All I was thinking about was my exams. I'd worked so hard and you can't get anywhere in life without them. I want to get to university. I only had a few weeks of study this year. I've forgotten so much. I will do my best to pass my exams.\"</p> <p>Many teachers from the north have also fled south, forced out by the Islamists because they were employed by the state to teach a secular curriculum. \"They hate the public school system, so what can I do? I can't teach the Qur'an, I'm classically trained,\" says Souleymane Maiga, who was teaching physics and chemistry in Timbuktu. \"I had to leave, but then all the teachers have come here. I'm not expecting to find another job.\"</p> <p>Mali already has a poor education record. According to the UN children's fund, Unicef, adult literacy rates for 15 to 24-year-olds are 47% for men and 31% for women. Thousands of children, especially girls, barely make it through primary school. Most wealthy parents send their children to private schools where fees can be upwards of $1,000 a year.</p> <p>\"The closure of these schools in the north just compounds an already difficult situation and places extra strain on the system, particularly with the suspension of aid after the military coup in March by some donors,\" says Euphrates Gobina, Unicef's head of education in Bamako. \"We're only reaching a small number of children so far, those in grades 1 to 8 [childen aged five to 15] are not getting anything at the moment.\"</p> <p>There seems little prospect of the lost territory in the north being regained soon. Mali's president has formally requested the regional grouping, the Economic Community Of West African States, to send a force to assist Mali's army in that task, but the issue remains deeply divisive among Malians and some of the soldiers behind March's coup have said they will not accept foreign forces on Malian soil.</p>",

While <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/sep/15/love-and-information-royal-court-review\">Michael Billington was impressed</a> by the scope of Churchill's experimental drama, some readers of the site thought it was a relentless bore, too superficial in its approach.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/18299565\">Treehouse76 wrote</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>I \u2026 was massively underwhelmed by this piece.

Perhaps if Antony had departed sooner, the score would've been higher; the scene where Cleopatra and Octavius meet was particularly excellent. In fact, Martin Hutson's superb performance alone should warrant at least three stars for the production.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/18331532\">CrabbyGit wrote</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>From the point of view of a paying customer, I got my money's worth, and it gave the occasion for fruitful discussions with others; for example it was interesting to see the symmetry in the plight of Octavia and Cleopatra, and the extent to which women's equality will still leave them wrestling with the problems of the personal and the political \u2026 and whether they can resolve them as men have done via class and status role play. All the acting was solid and Cattrall in particular has the power and stamina to take on this great role.</p> </blockquote> <p>Last week's roundup included <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/theatreblog/2012/sep/14/stage-reader-reviews-hedda-gabler\">your thoughts on Hedda Gabler</a> and the discussion continues this week with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/georgiacsnow/statuses/249106515770884096\">@georginacsnow</a>'s enthusiastic Twitter review:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/georgiacsnow/statuses/249106515770884096\">@guardianstage @Sheridansmith1's Hedda Gabler is electrifying in its animosity; a venomous ice queen.</a></p> </blockquote> <p>We now move on to dance and though <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/sep/16/san-francisco-ballet-programme-1\">Judith Mackrell was galvanised by the San Francisco Ballet</a> performance of a classic Balanchine at Sadler's Wells, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/18319570\">Matilda21</a> was left unimpressed:</p> <blockquote> <p>I found the San Francisco Ballet no more than a good provincial company.

  "<p>No doubt about the big one this weekend. With due respect to the streaking <strong>Chicago Fire</strong> and their tangle with <strong>Columbus Crew</strong> on Saturday night, for the Fire's play-off charge to translate to a meaningful Supporters Shield challenge at some point they'd have to overtake <strong>San Jose Earthquakes</strong>. And realistically, for that to happen <strong>Seattle Sounders</strong> need to get something at home to San Jose later that evening. Not that the earlier game won't be fascinating in its own right and <strong>Sporting Kansas City</strong> (away to <strong>Montreal Impact</strong>) and <strong>New York Red Bulls</strong> (away to <strong>New England</strong>) will be watching events at Toyota Park just as closely as those at CenturyLink Field. </p> <p>Elsewhere in the East, <strong>DC United</strong> will host <strong>Chivas USA</strong> and <strong>Houston Dynamo</strong> will travel to <strong>Philadelphia Union</strong> in Sunday games, knowing what their rivals around them have done the day before. In the day's third game <strong>Vancouver Whitecaps</strong> will host <strong>Colorado Rapids</strong> with a similar opportunity to make up ground on the teams around them, such as <strong>LA Galaxy</strong>, who will have played <strong>Toronto</strong>, and <strong>Real Salt Lake</strong> who host <strong>Portland Timbers</strong> in a rare TV appearance on NBCSN on Saturday night. Vancouver might be less concerned with these fixtures than holding off the challenge of FC Dallas, and with the Texan team not playing this week, and the Whitecaps finally hitting a run of home games, now would be a great time for them to arrest their slide.</p> <p>Just winding up to begin the long slide for home - our guest fan reps, bloggers, podcasters and beat writers, who've been with us all season and following and commenting on their local teams for much longer. We've asked them to cast an eye over last week's games and look forward to this weekend's fixtures, and the results are below. Read what they have to say, add your predictions in the comments section and then join me for <strong>Seattle Sounders v San Jose Earthquakes live on saturday night</strong>, and on Monday for<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/series/mls-five-things-we-learned\"> Five Things We Learned</a>.</p> <p><em>All kick off times are listed in EST</em></p> <h2>Montreal Impact vs Sporting KC, Sat 1pm (TSN, RDS)</h2> <p><strong>Sofiane Benzaza</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.mountroyalsoccer.com\">Mount Royal Soccer</a>, Montreal:</p> <p>Covering the Montreal Impact takes you through a roller coaster of up and downs and the 3-1 loss to Chicago was a down for the club. The Montreal Impact must have led at least half of their games played this season and lost more games than they won. The physical and mental fatigue in the second half overshadowed the good and positive first half, with Marco Di Vaio scoring his 5th goal of the season: that is 4 goals in the last 4 games.</p> <p>The good news for Montreal is that their next opponent, Sporting Kansas City, already played mid-week against the New York Red Bulls. But if the Impact defense had trouble defending a complete Chicago team, Sporting KC is as difficult, or more. Led by a rejuvenated Zusi in the midfield, Kansas City is known to cross the ball in and attack from the side a lot. The Impact defense (and team as a whole) has shown difficulty to defend crosses whether it was against the Columbus Crew or the Chicago Fire. Playing at home is a big advantage for the Impact though, and the players will need all of the energy and positive vibes they can get from their passionate fans this weekend. Hope is not lost to make the playoffs but to end up with a 3-game losing streak after the next game is not the successful road map for making to the MLS playoffs.</p> <p><strong>Mike Kuhn</strong>, Editor, <a href=\"http://www.downthebyline.com/\">Down the Byline</a>, Sporting Kansas City:</p> <p>Sporting continued being road warriors this season in New York on Wednesday night as they handed the Red Bulls their first loss at Red Bull Arena this season.&#xa0; In the win, Sporting's 8th of the season on the road, they did what they haven't been able to do as well at home, they made good with the chances they got.&#xa0;Thanks to some lax defending early on KC grabbed the two early goals, and with KC's defense, they were able to withstand New York's late push.&#xa0;It's been KC's road form that has really carried them this season as they now have more wins and more goals, in fewer games than they do at Livestrong Sporting Park.<br>&#xa0;<br>KC get to continue their road ways Saturday in an early kick off against the Montreal Impact.&#xa0; It's thankfully a quicker trip than their trip out to New York (where they didn't leave KC until about 21 hours before the game against New York, due to storms).&#xa0;The Impact have lost their last two games, on the road to Columbus and Chicago, but they haven't lost at Stade Saputo since Kansas City beat them 3-1 back on July 4th.&#xa0; They've made the stadium an extremely tough place for teams to come in and get points, which was apparent in KC's first trip there, where it took 2 PKs and a deflected goal for KC to get the 3-1 win. If KC's going to extend their unbeaten run to 8 games, they'll have to do it without Roger Espinoza who is suspended for yellow card accumulation.&#xa0;Without Espinoza's engine in the midfield it's going to be tough to get all 3 points, but confidence has to be high, after the result in New York, to end another home unbeaten run and keep chase in the Supporters' Shield race.</p> <h2>New England Revolution vs New York Red Bulls, Sat 7.30pm</h2> <p><strong>Christopher Camille</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.midnightriders.com/\">Midnight Riders</a>, author of NE tactics blog <a href=\"http://soccertheory.wordpress.com/\">Soccer Theory</a>:</p> <p>The Revs lost again this Saturday but what else is new? They had some moments against DC on Saturday but the team was once again undisciplined and lacking leadership. </p> <p>The fans were treated to a possible new identity for the club when former MLS all-star Juan Toja came on in the waning moments of the match. Along with his immense quality, Toja provides a presence that the Revs have lacked since they dealt club icon Shalrie Joseph. If the Revs keep getting lucky with these league mandated drafts, allocations, and waiver acquisitions they could very well become a mediocre team in a few season. They've added Clyde Simms, Lee Nguyen, Benny Feilhaber, and Juan Toja in similar fashion (read: no actual work of their own!).</p> <p><strong>Dan Dickinson</strong>, Sports editor, <a href=\"http://www.gothamist.com\">Gothamist</a>, New York:</p> <p>One could be forgiven, after Saturday's rather dramatic win over a surging Columbus Crew, for thinking that the Red Bulls could roll all the way to the end of the season as a juggernaut. That sweet high of optimism and belief began to pervade a fan base that typically second guesses every move from the club - and so Wednesday's 2-0 destruction at the hands of Sporting Kansas City has brought everything crashing back down to Earth. Everyone has their pet theory for why the team (and the fans) failed to show up in what was the biggest game of the season; I'd be more concerned about the next five games, which will feature Sporting Kansas City and a streaking Chicago Fire both coming to town once more, as well as a season-closing fight at PPL Park against a Philadelphia Union side that would love to play spoiler to the Red Bulls' playoff hopes. </p> <p>The first part of that gauntlet is a daunting away trip to the New England Revolution. &#xa0;The Revs, now out of playoff contention for yet another season and mostly hoping to run out the clock on a forgettable year, have one thing in their favor: the NY/NJ MLS franchise has not won there since 2002. Backe's lineup against SKC rested Le Toux and Cooper, so expect them to be trotted out and Henry to again avoid the turf of Gillette Stadium. NY will need an intervention to stop their addiction to falling behind early - they've now conceded 11 in the first quarter-hour, and New England is most effective in that same window, having scored 10. Given history, I expect an unsatisfying 1-1 draw. </p> <h2>Real Salt Lake vs Portland Timbers, Sat 8pm (NBCSN, TSN 2)</h2> <p><strong>Denzel Eslinger</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.rslsoapbox.com/\">RSL Soapbox</a>:</p> <p>Real Salt Lake kept their Champions League hopes alive with a win over Tauro FC on Tuesday night in Panama, now on Saturday they will look to keep the Portland Timbers as the only team in Major League Soccer without a road win. Oh and more importantly a win for RSL would seal their spot in the playoffs. Real Salt Lake will have to find a way to score a goal without Alvaro Saborio who picked up a shoulder injury on Tuesday and will be out a couple of weeks - that could be a problem as Saborio has scored 7 of RSL's last 10 goals. The upside for RSL is the match should mark the return of Jamison Olave to MLS action. The RSL defense has allowed just a single goal in their last 5 matches (all competitions), so can they keep the Timbers from scoring? I don't think so, but I think RSL will still find a way to exploit a Timbers defense that has given up 49 goals so far this season. Look for a 2-1 RSL win.</p> <p><strong>Michael Pearson</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.timbersarmy.org\">Timbers Army</a>, Portland:</p> <p>Two games in 5 days against two of the best teams in the West with really only the Cascadia Cup and a roster spot for next year as motivation, the Timbers came away with two strangely satisfying draws. Against the Sounders, the Timbers showed the fight and vigor that's been missing far too often this season - then against league leading San Jose, Timbers went up 2-0 on two great goals by a newly inserted Danny Mwanga, before bunkering against a Wondo, Gordon and Lenhart attack, something our spotty defense just couldn't hold. Yes, they gave up the lead, but even deploying a different formation, and a second-choice keeper, the Timbers still looked competent, which frankly, is not something we've seen on the road much this year and generally this team looks like perhaps it isn't quite a complete rebuild that Caleb Porter has in front of him.</p> <p>That thought will be tested on short rest at altitude against fearsome RSL. Gavin Wilkenson (or is it Sean McAuley) rotated the squad a bit to cover for injuries to Chara and Ricketts, so it will be interesting to see if they have more new ideas in mind when they head to Rio Tinto. RSL will be traveling a bit further than the short flight from San Jose, coming from a midweek CCL game in Panama. What kind of a side will Kreis trots out, a weaker side that may still be able to beat the winless on the road Timbers, or do they go for the win and a chance to lock in a playoff spot? Alvaro Saborio will be missing out with a separated shoulder, but RSL should still have plenty of firepower available. &#xa0;</p> <h2>Chicago Fire vs Columbus Crew, Sat 8.30pm</h2> <p><strong>Gregg Mixdorf</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.hottimeinoldtown.com/\">Hot Time in Old Town</a>, Chicago:</p> <p>After a nice 3-1 win over the Montreal Impact the Fire host another Eastern conference playoff hopeful in the Columbus Crew. Both teams are flush with confidence. Chicago is 6-1-1 dating back to July 28th while Columbus is 6-3-2 during that time. These teams have already played each other twice. The home team winning each game 2-1. Expect the Fire to put out their now customary lineup. Offensively the Fire have been sparked by their multi faceted midfield. Alvaro Fernandez is settling in as he has scored goals in consecutive weeks. Winger Patrick Nyarko is having another stellar season. Chris Rolfe roving dangerously behind Dutch striker Sherjill Macdonald creates a one two punch that needs to be dealt with. The Fire will be giving Columbus a group of dangerous attackers that they did not see in their previous encounters.<br> <br>This game is hard to predict from a tactical standpoint. Columbus with Higuain, Arrieta and Mirosevic present a dangerous attack that is new to Chicago. Pardo and Pause will be key for the Fire to contain the potent Columbus attack. This should be a terrific game. Columbus will be fighting for its playoff life while Chicago drives for the Eastern Conference crown. Expect a vibrant attacking game that will be full of emotion. Should be a great evening at Toyota Park.<br>Prediction: Fire 3 Crew 3</p> <p><strong>Ian Fraser</strong>, <a href=\"http://crewunion.com\">Crew Union</a>, Columbus Crew:</p> <p>Just when I thought I would be talking about&#xa0;the magic&#xa0;disappearing and the Crew falling&#xa0;back into the September struggles they've seen in recent seasons, I was reminded of the excitement this team generated in the month of August. A loss at Red Bull Arena on the weekend was not so unexpected but the injury&#xa0;situation that kept Higuain out of the game, the&#xa0;nature in which the&#xa0;goals were&#xa0;given up and the failed conversion of their own chances created a cause for concern. Then, as the&#xa0;opportunities continued to go by the wayside in a must win game at home against Chivas, Justin&#xa0;Meram cleaned up a chance created through some&#xa0;good work from Tchani, Higuain and Arrieta and the playoff drive is alive. It may not have been pretty but this team is scrappy right now.<br>&#xa0;<br>Some midseason changes to the Fire turned a dangerous attack into a lethal one and that will be the Crew's biggest challenge this weekend as one of the worrying trends in Columbus lately has been the defense, starting with the play of Chad Marshall. It was good to see them finally pitch a shutout and hopefully that will carry over into Saturday but something still seems off about this unit currently. The offense is still going to be reliant on the quality of Arrieta and Higuain but its the extra contribution from one of the other offensive cast members that is crucial to this team's scoring capabilities. In a game with large implications in the East standings, both teams will leave with a point.</p> <h2>Seattle Sounders vs San Jose Earthquakes, Sat 10.30pm</h2> <p><strong>Guardian live game</strong></p> <p><strong>Dave Clark</strong>, <a href=\"\" http: www.sounderatheart.com \"\">Sounder at Heart</a>, Seattle:</p> <p>Last week Seattle dropped much need points against some team to the south. That mere draw nearly eliminated their chances at the Supporters' Shield. The blame can be pointed at a rare set-piece defensive miscue. It is in no way indicative of an issue with the team overall. Seattle had the opportunity to win on the road, but a draw in one of the strongest home environments is not a loss. Thankfully, that same team to the South managed a draw against the Sounders competition for that top spot in the West.</p> <p>Saturday's match against the San Jose Earthquakes is a final opportunity during the full season to demonstrate that Seattle can not just hang with, but beat the best teams in MLS 2012. Against the 'Quakes and Sporks the Sounders have struggled. Both teams play more than typically with their hips and shoulders, using their bodies to frustrate the opposition. Seattle is led by technical players. Those players need to use technique to avoid the small spaces and cede the initiative to San Jose. Fueled by home passion and a drive for MLS Cup Playoff position the Sounders should play their best game of the year, even without Eddie Johnson. </p> <p><strong>Lisa Erickson</strong>, <a href=\"\" http: www.centerlinesoccer.com \"\">Center Line Soccer</a>, San Jose:</p> <p>It's back to being a Wondo-ful world in San Jose. Portland came to the Buck on Wednesday evening and in a rare move to rest Wondo and Gordon, Frank Yallop played Simon Dawkins and Steven Lenhart up top. Having various players out of position (or now seeing time due to Marvin Chavez and Shea Salinas injuries) showed in the lack of offensive gusto against Timbers' 3rd string goalkeeper. With Portland leading, Chris Wondolowski was finally called into the game in the 50th minute. It took him only 15 minutes to find the back of the net in his first MLS run of play goal since July 14th. And finally in stoppage time, with Portland up 2-1, Wondo scored his 21st goal of the season (a feat last accomplished by Taylor Twellman and Carlos Ruiz in 2002) to salvage a point and keep the unbeaten streak at Buck Shaw going strong.</p> <p>Onwards to Seattle, to take on the 2nd placed Western Conference team. In the past two meetings, San Jose has come out with both victories. However, this isn't the same Seattle that they saw back in March nor even last month. Good news for Quakes is that Seattle's Eddie Johnson has to sit out due to yellow card accumulation. Seattle is also coming back from a trip to Honduras and a tough draw with Portland, which might bode well for the men in blue and black. We will see if Jason Hernandez starts on the backline for the ever inconsistent Ike Opara and if Shea Salinas will be healthy enough to add speed on the wings. It will be a tough but great match that might be a preview to the MLS Western Conference finals.</p> <h2>LA Galaxy vs Toronto FC, Sat 10.30pm (TSN, RDS2)</h2> <p><strong>Josh Guesman</strong>, founder, <a href=\"http://www.thesection108.com\">The Section 108</a> blog, co-host of <a href=\"http://nasn.tv/category/corner-of-the-galaxy/\">Corner of the Galaxy</a> podcast, LA:</p> <p>The Los Angeles Galaxy have been taking advantage of an easy September schedule. They are perfect in September and are unbeaten in their last 7 games. They have beaten the teams they were supposed to beat and the 2-0 victory over the visiting Colorado Rapids was no exception.&#xa0;</p> <p>Landon Donovan returned to action for 78 minutes and assisted on the first goal to Robbie Keane in the 12th minute. Donovan hadn't played since a victory over Chivas USA on August 12th due to an injury sustained in the US Mens' National Team victory over Mexico. In addition to Donovan, the Galaxy also added recently signed Christian Wilhelmsson, who fared well in his debut and scored the game's second goal in the 58th minute.</p> <p>With just a quick stopover in Puerto Rico for the CCL midweek, the Galaxy continue their stretch of favorable scheduling with a matchup against Toronto FC on Saturday night at the Home Depot Center. The Eastern Conference bottom dwellers will look to continue to shock the Galaxy as this same Toronto FC team knocked the heavily favored Galaxy out of the quarter finals of the CCL at the beginning of the MLS Season. Payback will be ripe on the minds of the defending MLS Cup Champions and a much different result is expected on the HDC turf. While Landon Donovan looks to have made his return to the starting lineup, fighting through a hamstring injury, and will more than likely feature for LA, David Beckham is unknown in his injury status. The star midfielder missed the Rapids game and the CCL game in Puerto Rico with an ankle injury sustained against Vancouver.</p> <p><strong>Boris Aguilar</strong>, Executive, <a href=\"http://www.redpatchboys.ca/\">Red Patch Boys</a></p> <p>The season for Toronto FC doesn't seem to be getting any easier. In fact, with each passing day things seem to be getting more difficult. Not too long ago, the fans and supporters alike were happy with a draw. Nowadays, a draw feels like a loss and a loss in which we give up a late goal hurts even more. Over the weekend Toronto took a comfortable lead and blew it in the 85th minute. Toronto FC have given up a late goal far too many times and its something that fans and supporters have grown used to. </p> <p>This week Toronto travels to Los Angeles to face the defending MLS champions. The last time the two sides met in Los Angeles was for Champions League play. Toronto looked like such a different team then. Things looked so promising for year ahead. This time, the two teams square off in the league. While Toronto doesn't have a play-off spot to play for, they do have fans, supporters and themselves to play for. Having said all of that, at the very least as a supporter I am hoping for a draw.</p> <h2>Philadelphia Union vs Houston Dynamo, Sun 4pm</h2> <p><strong>Charlie Flowe</strong>, host of <a href=\"http://worldsportsshow.com/\">World Sports Show</a> and writer for <a href=\"http://www.PhillySportsLive.com\">PhillySportsLive.com</a>:</p> <p>It was one of those games where Philadelphia came out with a lot of energy and an experimental attack led by Hoppenot and McInerney. Last goal by a striker was July 29th, so they trying an experiment with next season in mind. Philly actually dominated possession, but a combination of Bill Hamid, in inspired form, and Philadelphia not finishing, meant they weren't able to score, and DC won it with a goal on a breakaway from a Philly corner.</p> <p>I'd like to see a different type of line up on Sunday because the Union are not in the play-off hunt. It's a chance to bring in fringe players, some USLPro reserve players, and put out an experimental type of line up to learn for 2013. There's a degree of acceptance now that the season has run its course and it's time to look forward. Houston's been on a pretty hot streak and I'm thinking they may win 2-0.</p> <p><strong>Zach Woosley</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.dynamotheory.com/\">Dynamo Theory</a>, Houston:</p> <p>Grumble grumble. I guess last week went alright, I mean the Dynamo got a point away in Kansas City and that's good...however. WE HAD THE &amp;^@^!&amp;#% LEAD IN STOPPAGE TIME! Sigh. I'm still having nightmares of watching that ball sail over the head of Bobby Boswell to the unmarked waiting CJ Sapong. It's actually a recurring nightmare because that's not the first time we've seen a ball fly over the mis-positioned Boswell and lead to a goal. Grumble grumble.</p> <p>The Dynamo travel to the Philadelphia Union on Sunday to face a team that will not be making the playoffs, so of course that makes them even more dangerous. The Union are playing for pride and the Dynamo better be ready or they'll drop important points. Look, Houston will probably make the playoffs, but if they want to avoid the wild card game, they need every possible point from their final five matches they can get. Dropping points to the Union, even at PPL Park, just isn't going to fly. It's a must win honestly but somehow I fear the Dynamo will find a way to only get a draw. I hope I'm wrong.</p> <h2>D.C. United vs Chivas USA, Sun 7pm (Galavision)</h2> <p><strong>Kim Kolb</strong>, <a href=\"http://screaming-eagles.com/\">Screaming Eagles</a>:</p> <p>United must face the final stretches of the season without the services of Dwayne DeRosario, who suffered a season ending knee injury while on duty with the Canadian National Team.&#xa0;To the team's credit, they're not looking to one player to fill the void, but they're expecting everyone to step up to fill the void.&#xa0;</p> <p>New England was the first test in this new reality on a night where coach Ben Olsen was inducted into the team's Hall of Tradition, and DeRosario was honored for being the seventh player to notch 100 goals in MLS.&#xa0;United came out strong, but not precise, showing the rust of the time off, then they gave up a goal on a counter.&#xa0;The teams finished the half level at one, but United started the second half very sloppy, and were guilty of several turnovers close to their own goal and were lucky not to go down a goal again.&#xa0;Olsen replaced Boscovic, who was visibly not happy with the decision, with Lewis Neal.&#xa0;Neal rewarded the move though, with his first MLS goal minutes later.&#xa0;United managed to hold on despite a lack of possession the rest of the way, and gutted out the win.</p> <p>United will need to dig deep again at Philadelphia Thursday night.&#xa0;Boscovic seems poised to make a statement on the field, now that he's made some statements off the field, and he could be looking to avenge his red card from Philadelphia's last visit to RFK.&#xa0;United will need to recover quickly, though as Chivas USA comes to RFK on Sunday.&#xa0;Both games are excellent opportunities to secure points against teams out of the playoff race in an effort to strengthen United's own playoff hopes.</p> <p><strong>Julio Ramos</strong>, \"Chivas Mayor\", <a href=\"http://www.unionultras.com\">Union Ultras</a>:</p> <p>It was a tough tough game to watch - another game, maybe the 8th or 9th consecutive one, where we could not pick up the win. Chivas came out aggressive for the first 15 minutes and once they thought they could take a pint away they just dropped back. Too many players just wondering about and it looks like the team lacks soul and heart. What's more frustrating is that those players keep on playing, they aren't rotated for others on the bench. The game itself - another mistake, another late goal. I think that overall we need a change. I don't think that the players believe in the coach's ideas any more. Some of its pressure from losing, some of its lack of trust in the caching staff. Honestly I think the best thing right now for both Fraser and the team is to each go their own way. He has worked very hard for this team but it's not working, and I think that with the new ownership, we'll probably have a new coach for next season.</p> <p>We have always got positive results when we've played DC in recent years, but I don't know about this one to be honest. Hopefully the players can at least come up with the first goal and we'll go from there. I'm hoping for the win but I think it's going to be difficult.</p> <h2>Vancouver Whitecaps vs Colorado Rapids, Sun 7.30pm</h2> <p><strong>Benjamin Massey</strong>, Editor, <a href=\"http://www.eightysixforever.com\">Eighty Six Forever</a>, Vancouver:</p> <p>The Vancouver Whitecaps at least managed to lose with dignity last week in Dallas. A more-or-less even game ended in catastrophe when a barely-scoring failed DP scored a magnificent long-range goal in the last second of stoppage time; there's really not a lot you can do to game plan for that. It's just the soccer gods kicking the Whitecaps in the teeth with steel toes now. </p> <p>The perfect denouement for that is of course for Vancouver to play well against Colorado, lose, and wind up somehow missing the playoffs by half a point. Now, the Colorado Rapids also aren't playing brilliantly, and the Whitecaps may experience the relief of a return to BC Place. But the pressure in Vancouver is high right now, with reporters asking tedious questions about \"do you think you need to play well for the team to win?\" and fans going on Twitter flipping 140-character lids. On their merits, Vancouver ought to be competitive with Colorado right now, but mentally the Rapids should have an advantage.</p> <p><strong>Todd Haggerty</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.pidarmy.com\">Pid Army</a>:</p> <p>When does the season end? If there is one thing about the Rapids this season it is that they are very consistent, consistently bad. Last Friday's game against the Gals included comical defending and horrible finishing, leading to another loss. Despite this,the Rapids are 8 points behind this weekends opponent, the Whitecaps, it would be a travesty for the Rapids to somehow make the playoffs and extend this nightmare of a season (please put the supporters out of their misery). Given the Rapids anemic road record they should emerge from the weekend 11 points out of the last playoff spot and can officially look to next season and developing the 2013 squad around the midfield trio of Larentowicz, Rivero and Thomas.</p> <p><em>Some of these previews were submitted prior to midweek games</em></p>",
  "<p>G4S was, until early August of this Olympic year, hardly a household name company. Atos had been the target of disability rights campaigners but beyond the activists not many would know what they get up to. Dow Chemical would hardly register at all.</p> <p>All three of course were either official sponsors or approved suppliers of London 2012. Yet the high profile they paid so much for proved to be almost entirely negative. In <a href=\"http://www.philosophyfootball.com/view_item.php?pid=804\" title=\"\">my book</a> I made a plea for an uncommercial Games, the Olympic five rings to be protected as a symbol of sport, not a logo for the corporations. As an Olympics romantic I resented the Games' historic symbolism being used to flog fast food, fizzy drinks and dodgy internet connections.</p> <p>Yet I needn't have been so bothered, instead of militant opposition the companies managed to foul up their own PR so spectacularly that the commercialisation of London 2012 ended up being anything but the smooth and irresistible process I had feared. G4S will now forever be associated with their failure to provide the security staff and having to be bailed out by the armed services. Atos's unpopularity amongst the disabled community is now far better known than their supply of IT systems for London 2012. And the Bhopal chemical disaster, which many had probably forgotten about, was back in the news and associated with Dow Chemical.</p> <p>But it gets worse. Which marketing genius came up with the deal for Visa? Discovering that Visa is the only card with which you are able to buy tickets or food at the ground does nothing to make you feel warm about the company if you have their card, and inspires unreserved hatred for Visa if you don't own one.</p> <p>The sponsors were also a focus for unremitting scrutiny if they'd snapped up free tickets as part of any deal, especially if they were guilty of causing empty seats because they didn't take up their allocations. And hardly a day went by when the unhealthy products that most of the sponsors are responsible for were in one media spotlight or another with questions being asked why they were allowed to be associated with sport.</p> <p>London 2012 was subject to the strict guidelines for branding in all Olympic venues. These are pleasingly advert-free, an example of tough legislation to prevent the commodification of sport. It meant that outside the arenas, and in the build up, the advertising frenzy went completely overboard. But once the real action began, the standout gold medal-winning performances we'll all remember, there was not an advert or sponsor in sight. This for me is how it should be: the sponsors aren't backing the Olympics out of any charitable intent, they are using it to make money, to sell more products. They need the Olympics every bit as much as London 2012 needed their money. And there's plenty of competition to be a sponsor too, nothing reaches a global audience in the same way as the Olympics. So it was right to regulate their involvement and their profile to ensure they didn't overwhelm the Games.</p> <p>But (whisper it quietly) with no profile in the arenas, the bad press is likely to outweigh the good. What's more, the unpredictability of who wins the gold medals means they are likely to be associated with a non-Olympic sponsor. Mo Farah is a Nike man, so his gold medal was of next to no use to official London 2012 sponsor, Adidas.</p> <p>I could almost feel sorry for all the money the sponsors have wasted, but I won't. They still get all the credit for backing London 2012 rather than the Games' biggest single sponsor: you and me, the British taxpayer.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Ferdinand von Schirach </strong><em>The Collini Case</em></h2> <p>A venerable man of German industry is brutally murdered in a hotel room. The killer hands himself in to police but refuses to explain his crime. To the press and the courts it looks like the motiveless work of a psychopath \u2013 until an inexperienced defence lawyer Caspar Leinen discovers documents about the dead man's secret past in Nazi-occupied Italy.</p> <p>Lawyer Ferdinand von Schirach \u2013 a lawyer whose grandfather Baldur von Schirach led the Hitler Youth was reich youth leader of the Nazi party \u2013 established himself as an author with two collections of short stories in 2009 and 2010, Guilt and Crime. The Collini Case has not only been a bestseller since it was published in 2011, it has also ignited a debate about a 1968 law, the introductory act to administrative offences, that meant many accused of war crimes during the Nazi era could only be tried for manslaughter, not murder. In February this year, the justice ministry commissioned an investigation into criminal law changes of the 1950s and 1960s.</p> <p>Germany's new role at the centre of Europe's political stage has led to soul searching at home and abroad: is the new generation done with atoning for the sins of its grandparents, finished with wartime guilt? Judging by the success of Von Schirach's novel, the process of historical self-examination is far from finished. In many ways The Collini Case is a step back from the last bestseller by a lawyer-novelist, Bernhard Schlink's The Reader, published in 1995, which broke many taboos by portraying a Nazi criminal in a partly sympathetic light. Von Schirach's book stays resolutely on the victims' side.</p> <h2><strong>Manfred Spitzer </strong><em>Digital Dementia</em></h2> <p>The famous neuroscientist argues that our growing reliance on search engines, satnavs and Wikipedia means we are failing to give our grey matter the kind of workout it needs. The unlikely heroes of Spitzer's study turn out to be a familiar species: London black-cab drivers. Thanks to a study of a taxi driver who had memorised \"the knowledge\" of the capital's streets, he writes, \"we know that the brain is not only the most complicated, but the most dynamic organ in our body. It grows or shrinks according to usage.\"</p> <h2><strong>Wolfgang Herrndorf </strong><em>Tschick</em></h2> <p>Praised by critics as a \"German Huckleberry Finn\", Herrndorf's Spiegel bestseller tells the story of a teenager from a wealthy but dysfunctional family and his Russian-German classmate, who one summer holiday embark on a road trip around the former GDR in a stolen Lada. It's also an exploration of the real East Germany as the west still doesn't know it.</p> <p>\"The world is bad, and people are bad too. That's what my parents told me, my teachers told me and television tells me. But the strange thing was that on our journey Tschick and I almost exclusively met those few people who weren't bad at all.\" A few months before the novel appeared in 2010, 46-year-old Herrndorf was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of cancer. He has been chronicling his daily struggles with the illness in an <a href=\"http://www.wolfgang-herrndorf.de/\" title=\"\">online journal</a>since.</p> <h2><strong>Ann-Marlene Henning and Tina Bremer-Olszewski </strong><em>Make Love</em></h2> <p>A Joy of Sex for a generation growing up with internet porn, combining infographics, arthouse photography and practical advice. \"The abundance of sex creates a false impression of familiarity: we've seen it all, we've done it all,\" the authors write in the introduction. \"But the problem is: what the media presents as sexuality has little to do with the real thing.\" As a remedy, Henning and Bremer-Olszewski give us surprising facts (did you know that a full-on snog engages as many as 17 muscles?), a guide to rude words from around the world and a thorough deconstruction of modern porn cliches. Shifted more than 60,000 copies in the first 10 weeks after publication.</p> <h2>Rolf Dobelli: The Art of Clear Thinking</h2> <p>In 52 short chapters Dobelli tries to put a finger on why CEOs, economists or just the average shopper makes mistakes: because we sometimes believe in stories rather than facts, because we fail to draw lessons from our own failures or because we think that an item chosen from a large selection is more valuable than one from a small one. Mixing management-speak and real science, Dobelli's bestseller (300,000 sales to date) follows in the wake of Naseem Nicholas Taleb's Black Swan and Daniel Kahnemann's Thinking Fast and Slow.</p> <h2><strong>Thilo Sarrazin </strong><em>Europe Doesn't Need the Euro</em></h2> <p>\"If the euro fails, then Europe failed,\" Angela Merkel said in September last year, but former Bundesbank member Thilo Sarrazin doesn't buy it. Ditching the deutschmark, he says, was driven by \"magical thinking\", and those Germans now calling for eurobonds are \"driven by that very German reflex, which says that we have only repented for the Holocaust and world war once all our belongings, including our money, has been handed into European ownership\".</p> <p>Europe Doesn't Need the Euro has sold more than 200,000 copies, but critics have taken issues with some of Sarrazin's conclusions. The S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung newspaper asked why Sarrazin doesn't spell out what would have happened if Germany had stuck with the deutschmark. \"Perhaps because a strong D-mark would have made German wares increasingly expensive?\" As with his polemical 2010 book on Germany's migrant minorities, Germany Abolishes Itself, Sarrazin is quick to point the finger at potential problems but much slower to come up with constructive solutions.</p>",

  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/17/angela-merkel-austerity-swabian-housewives\" title=\"\">Swabian housewife praised by Angela Merkel</a> for her thrift and no-nonsense attitude to life (accumulating wealth but not flaunting it) is undermining Germany's economic and cultural health. Far from being the perfect citizen, she and her husband are causing untold damage. Britons on left and right may look to Germany for lessons of success, but the Swabian cliche exemplifies everything that is wrong about Germany. It is why many young Germans reject the traditional lifestyle that comes with Germany's traditional economic model \u2013 disastrously, by avoiding the expense and restrictions connected with having children.</p> <p>Young, middle income people across Europe are more alike every year. They share similar tastes and yearn for similar futures. Young Germans are the same. Yet looking ahead, they fail to see how they can match their parents' lifestyles. They are living in an ageing society that insists on retreading a traditional culture so stultifying and straightjacketed that it suits only those who like repetitive work practices that date back to the 1950s.</p> <p>Of course young Germans can, with training and education, create and enjoy world-beating incomes and wealth for themselves, but the education and training needed to win a decent, well-paid job takes time. Many are deep into their late 20s or early 30s when they qualify.</p> <p>There will be many boring years in and out of university and the same low-level on-the-job training experienced in the UK, unless engineering or another form of metal bashing is the chosen subject.</p> <p>And when they gain the good job, there is the expectation that they will go through the old routine of working incredibly hard while living up to traditional norms of family life.</p> <p>Women are the worst affected (hence the popular emphasis on the Swabian housewife, who, like a member of the Women's Institute, is championed by the prime minister as the backbone of society rather than an outmoded throwback). <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/a-land-without-children-why-won-t-germans-have-more-babies-a-779741.html\" title=\"\">Mothers are forced to take on the job of sole childcarers</a> \u2013 in contrast to their UK and French counterparts, where the state shares the job. Like Italians, they are also told to look after an elderly relative without much state support. For young people from poorer backgrounds, the situation is even worse.</p> <p>So it is no coincidence that <a href=\"http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php?title=File:Total_fertility_rate,_1960-2009_(live_births_per_woman).png&amp;filetimestamp=20111130165651\" title=\"\">the birth rates in the UK, Sweden and France far outstrip that of Germany</a>. Berlin has thrown some money at mothers in recent times \u2013 the recent debate over Betreuungsgeld (childcare subsidy) is one example \u2013 but there is no sign of a change in attitude.</p> <p>Making matters worse, wealthier families act as bulwarks for tradition by <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10632313\" title=\"\">keeping much of their riches offshore to minimise their tax</a>, restricting the power of the state to step in and help. Contrary to the myth of the thrifty conservative German middle class, they were some of the biggest investors in US sub-prime mortgages ahead of the 2008 Lehmans crash.</p> <p>Many young people enjoy the traditional system. Others choose to opt out. As elsewhere, there are the unmarried couples, mixed-race and reconstituted families, yet it is a trend only recently acknowledged and certainly not embraced by the state.</p> <p>Without a hopeful, plentiful and enthusiastic young workforce, Germany will find it increasingly difficult to maintain living standards. Its foreign ministry, which is dominated by free marketeers, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18105037\" title=\"\">is convinced the free flow of labour, or mass immigration, is the answer</a>. Lots of young foreign workers will invade Swabian villages to do the jobs left vacant by a self-imposed \"no child\" policy, say its economic experts. Will the Swabian family approve? German economists argue it is the only answer.</p> <p>The UK, rather than holding out, has long embraced a more laissez-faire, flexible approach to labour rules that allow young people, whether homegrown or imported, to displace the old. There is, of course, plenty wrong with the UK's approach to building a better society: the suburbs of our cities harbour increasing numbers of older people, many of whom cheerlead for an austerity budget that hurts the young. But they are feeble and disorganised compared with their German counterparts.</p>",
  "<h2>1) Gene Sarazen v Charles Whitcombe (1927)</h2> <p>A quick quiz question to start, nothing too difficult. When was the first time a visiting Ryder Cup team travelled to the USA kitted out in nice suits, ones that weren't made from garish offcuts and didn't fall apart at the seams? Answer: 1983, when Tony Jacklin became captain of Europe, and ordered the men in charge to stop being such tightwads, and book some bloody seats for the players on Concorde while they were at it. 1983!</p> <p>It should come as little surprise, this being the case, that Great Britain's preparations for the inaugural Ryder Cup, at Worcester Country Club, Massachusetts in 1927, were a risible shambles. Getting to the States in the first place was quite an effort for Ted Ray's men. The magazine Golf Weekly launched an appeal to raise the \u00a33,000 required to send the Brits stateside, but only 216 of Britain's 1,750 golf clubs put their hands in their pockets to donate. In the end, the magazine's editor George Philpot, and garden-seed magnate Samuel Ryder himself, had to chip in a grand to make up the shortfall. The players were sent over on the RMS Aquitania, a six-day cruise over a choppy ocean. Arriving with wobbly sea legs and stomachs to match, they were immediately whisked off to get paggered on fizzy booze at a reception at a nearby country club.</p> <p>In fairness, the US team were strong favourites anyway, despite having been beaten by Britain in a trial run, the \"lost\" Ryder Cup of 1926 at Wentworth. This time they were playing at home, could now call on Gene Sarazen, and were significantly younger than the Brits. The British player-captain Ray, for example, was 50, with his major-winning years (the 1912 Open and 1920 US Open) well behind him; his opposite number Walter Hagen was only 35, had eight majors under his belt, with two Opens and a US PGA still to come. The Brits were also without their first choice as captain, Abe Mitchell \u2013 the cloth-capped chap preparing to tee off on top of the Ryder Cup trophy itself.</p> <p>As it transpired, the US won easily, by 9.5 points to 2.5. They had already secured the cup before Sarazen and Charles Whitcombe completed their singles match, but nevertheless the half Whitcombe earned in an amazing tussle stands as the first great British feat in Ryder Cup history. Sarazen was 25, the hottest property in golf, and would go on to become the first man to complete a career grand slam of all four modern majors. Whitcombe by comparison was a regular top-ten finisher in the Open, but a decent English pro, nothing more. Yet he stormed into a five-shot lead after 15 of 36 holes. Sarazen \u2013 who later described playing in the Ryder Cup as \"a cutthroat proposition\" even in the tournament's infancy \u2013 fought back to all-square within the next ten holes. The two battled tooth and nail until the 35th, which Whitcombe won \u2013 only to capitulate on the last by missing a short par putt to hand Sarazen half a point.</p> <p>Despite the shellacking, the Brits had enjoyed their visit. Arthur Havers, who had won the Open in 1923, recalled being \"submerged by hospitality and kindness\", and was in awe of \"a world of luxury and plenty ... Even the clubhouses were luxurious, with deep-pile carpets, not like the run-down and shabby ones at home, which is all most of us really knew.\"</p> <h2>2) Denny Shute v Syd Easterbrook (1933)</h2> <p>One thing the Brits did really know about was bloody miserable weather, and that's what the two teams had to contend with at the second Ryder Cup, the 1929 staging at Moortown Golf Club in Leeds. The Brits prevailed, the pivotal match being the battle of captains Walter Hagen and George Duncan. Hagen had boasted in the changing room before the match that \"there's a point for our team right there\", but didn't realise Duncan was on the other side of some clothes pegs, had heard every word, and as a result was fuelled by hot and righteous steam power. Duncan whipped Hagen 10&amp;8, posting an early point that would inspire his men to a 7-5 victory. But the weather works both ways, and would scupper British hopes at Scioto Country Club in Ohio two years later, a searing summer sun exhausting Whitcombe's side into a dehydrated dither, the USA sauntering to an easy 9-3 win.</p> <p>Home advantage appeared key, then, but despite the wind getting up at Southport &amp; Ainsdale in 1933, it looked like the USA had finally cracked the code for winning on one's travels. Britain had edged the foursomes by a point, but the States came right back at them in the singles. Sarazen, Hagen, Craig Wood and Horton Smith all posted points for the Americans, while Mitchell, Percy Alliss and Havers recorded wins for the Brits. It all came down to the match between Denny Shute of the USA and Britain's Syd Easterbrook. The showdown became the Ryder Cup's first full-blown classic, a nerve-jangling nonsense right up there with Nicklaus-Jacklin in 1969, Langer-Irwin in 1991, and Leonard-Olazabal in 1999.</p> <p>Shute took all of three holes to go three up, aided and abetted by some hopeless yipping on the greens by Easterbrook. The Brit pulled himself together, and was only one hole behind by lunch, having at one point dragged the scores back all square. Shute retained his advantage until the 15th \u2013 and 33rd \u2013 hole, whereupon Easterbroook drained a 15-foot birdie putt. The pair were all square again. Easterbrook then knocked in a 20-footer on 16 to save a half, before rattling in another saver on 17 which stopped Shute taking the match dormie and retaining the cup for America.</p> <p>And so to the 18th. With a huge crowd gathering, both players nervously dumped their drives into sand. Shute found another bunker, greenside, with his second, while Easterbrook laid up. The Brit then sent a wedge to 20 feet. Shute splashed out to a similar distance. It was at this point that the Prince of Wales, the future King Edward VIII and guest of honour at the event, won the cup for Britain. As the players lined up their putts, the Prince was greenside chatting to Hagen. The US captain desperately wanted to advise Shute to play it safe, lay up for two putts and an almost certain half, a tactic which would ensure the draw. But he felt \"it would be discourteous to walk out on the future king of England\", and so Shute was forced to fly solo.</p> <p>Easterbrook putted first, his ball stopping three feet shy of the cup. Shute then had a putt to win the trophy outright for the US, but instead of playing the percentages, had a rush of blood and trundled his effort seven feet past the hole. Suddenly he had a pressure putt to save a half \u2013 and he missed. Easterbrook still needed to knock in his testy three footer, but did so. Britain had regained the cup, thanks to a superlative putting performance from Easterbrook over the closing holes, doubly remarkable given his early travails on the greens.</p> <p>Watching in the stands was Samuel Ryder. It would be the last action he would ever see, as he failed to make the trip to Ridgewood, New Jersey in 1935, and died a year later. A fitting way to go out, then. And well done to Edward VIII, who seems to have annoyed quite a few people by packing in the King gig in 1936, but did more than enough for the old country with this single act in our book.</p> <h2>3) Lloyd Mangrum v Fred Daly (1949)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396469454\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2012/9/20/1348157390197/Lloyd-Mangrum-008.jpg\" alt=\"Lloyd Mangrum\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lloyd Mangrum lights up a smoke during a 1940s Masters Tournament at Augusta National Golf Club.

Both countries were still recovering from the traumas of war, and the Brits had to cope with the double whammies of food rationing \u2013 never a sportsperson's friend \u2013 and a week-long, two-legged sea and rail journey to get to the Pacific Northwest. A thrashing, yes. But a humiliation? These were the toughest of times, let's show these good people a little respect.</p> <p>Still, an 11-1 scoreline is an 11-1 scoreline, and two of America's biggest wins that weekend came courtesy of Lloyd Mangrum, who won both his foursomes and singles matches 6&amp;5. Now, it's pushing a point to say that the war did Mangrum any favours. But what he had to go through seems to have shaped a somewhat relaxed attitude to the comparatively insignificant pressures of tournament golf.</p> <p>Mangrum \u2013 a debonair Rhett Butler lookalike with pencil moustache and a fag always on \u2013 drove reconnaissance jeeps for the army in the Second World War. During the D-Day landings, he washed up on Omaha beach. He fought in the Battle of the Bulge. On one mission, he shattered his arm and shoulder when his jeep tipped over. On another, a sniper shot him in the knee as he attempted to rescue a stricken colleague. A third big day out ended prematurely when some shrapnel lodged in his granite jaw. He was awarded two Purple Hearts for all this assorted bother, although he would later joke that he had picked up his injuries while hot-footing it half-cut from a Paris brothel. Not a bad record for a man who, as a professional golfer, could legitimately have dodged the draft. \"I don't suppose any golfers who were combat soldiers, marines or sailors will be able to think of a three-putt as one of the really bad troubles in life,\" he suggested, between draws on his snout.</p> <p>In 1949, this insouciant approach helped him to secure the cup for the USA. This staging, at Ganton Golf Club in Scarborough, proved to be the first real needle match between the nations. The Americans swanned over with a crate containing 600 steaks, concerned that rationing would scupper their gannetry. Their offers to share the meat offended the proud British, although that was nothing compared to captain Ben Hogan's official complaint regarding the depth of the grooves on the British team's clubs. The match referee ruled in favour of the USA, and a Scarborough pro had to hastily file down the faces of the offending sticks.</p> <p>The Brits, with blazing pique, came storming out of the blocks to win the foursomes 3-1, but the Americans came straight back at them the following day, becoming the first team to turn around a two-point deficit in the singles. Dutch Harrison mauled Britain's top player Max Faulkner 8&amp;7 in the opening match, and the dye was cast. The cup was retained by the USA before the result of the final match between Mangrum and Fred Daly, though a Daly win would have at least levelled the scores. As it transpired, he had no chance. He shot 66 in the morning, but the ice-cool Mangrum \u2013 perpetually sucking on his cheroot \u2013 shot 65 which gave him a one-hole lead at lunch. Daly won two early holes in the afternoon to momentarily take the lead, but Mangrum simply pressed on the gas, winning five holes in a row to take the tape with a 4&amp;3 win. Daly had done next to nothing wrong, and would have won this outstanding match on nine out of ten other days, but on this one Mangrum was simply unbeatable.</p> <p>The Americans didn't have it all their own way on the trip, mind. Just before they went back home, the British government devalued the pound, causing the victorious team no end of heartache at the bureau de change as they assessed the damage to their previously bulging wallets. Still, at least the steak went down well.</p> <h2>4) and 5) Jim Turnesa v Peter Alliss (1953); Dave Douglas v Bernard Hunt (1953)</h2> <p>Britain hadn't won the Ryder Cup since 1933, but there was genuine hope that Henry Cotton's young team could snatch it from the Americans' grasp at Wentworth in 1953, especially as Ben Hogan \u2013 who had just completed the Hogan Slam by winning that year's Masters, US Open and Open \u2013 announced he wouldn't be available for the USA, having given up competing in 36-hole matches.</p> <p>The Americans, however, still had quality in depth, and they breezed to a 3-1 lead after the foursomes. An illustration of the gap between the two sides came in the match between the American playing captain Mangrum and Sam Snead, and Eric Brown and John Panton. On the 471-yard par-four 12th, Panton welted his drive down the middle, then the teak-tough Brown creamed a 2-wood as hard as he could. The ball came up 80 yards shy of the green. Snead, following up Mangrum's booming drive, hit a lazy 4-iron way over the flag. The US won that particular match 8&amp;7.</p> <p>Much of that British hope rested on the shoulders of two promising youngsters: the 23-year-old Bernard Hunt, and Peter Alliss, who had just finished in the top 10 at the Open and at 22 became, for the time, the youngest player to play in the Ryder Cup. Cotton showed faith in his kids, sending them both out on the first day \u2013 although both lost \u2013 then placing them at the business end of the singles on day two. It would ultimately prove an unwise decision, but how thin the line between right and wrong.</p> <p>The US started singles day by notching another point, Jack Burke seeing off Dai Rees easily enough. But just as the visitors prepared to glide home, the tide turned. Daly eviscerated Ted Kroll 9&amp;7. Eric Brown then dealt with Mangrum in a tetchy match, Brown complaining that the American's yellow pastel sweater was putting him off, Mangrum refusing to concede a one-foot putt simply to annoy his opponent. But Brown was immense, to the extent that the normally unflappable Mangrum four-putted one green. Another British point, Brown winning by two holes.</p> <p>The Americans began to feel jittery. Snead had been five holes up on Harry Weetman with six to play, but then collapsed in a style described by the Guardian's legendary Pat Ward-Thomas as \"pathetic\": he flayed his ball into the trees four times, covering the next five holes 6-4-6-6-5. All square going down the last, Weetman birdied as Snead finished with a miserable par. Another point for the home side, the overall score was level at 4-4, and all the momentum was with Britain.</p> <p>Max Faulkner lost to Cary Middlecoff by one hole in the fifth match of eight, but in the final match Harry Bradshaw saw off Fred Haas 3&amp;2. As Bradshaw \"walked proudly home\" (Ward-Thomas) he left two matches out on the course. The two matches involving the British rookies. Could they deliver the 1.5 points required to bring the cup back home? \"The last tragic moment ... will never be forgotten by the thousands who were present,\" sighed Ward-Thomas, \"nor by the two young men whose awful destiny it was to be the victims of the cruellest turn of fortune that could have been devised.</p> <p>\"The wonderful, almost unbelievable prospect of victory against the great American golfers became suddenly, desperately real. Then just as the cup was touching the lips it was smashed with brutal, heartrending suddenness. The tale must be told and it will be told again and again down the years whenever golfers meet.\"</p> <p>Pick up your heavy hearts, folks, here we go again. First the Alliss match. On the 16th tee, the future voice of golf was leading Jim Turnesa by one hole. Ramping up the tension, he'd just been told that if he held on for a point, Britain would be assured of a tie, and most likely win the cup too. Turnesa drove into the trees, but the ball hit a punter and bounced back out. He found a greenside bunker with his second, from which he scrambled par. Alliss couldn't get up and down from the front of the green and lost the hole, then drove one yard out of bounds on the 17th to lose another. He was now on the 18th tee, one down, desperately hoping to salvage a half, and that Hunt behind him \u2013 one up on Dave Douglas, who had just driven out of bounds on 17 \u2013 could hold on for a win.</p> <p>Turnesa drove into trees again. He could only knock the ball back out into the fairway, and hit his subsequent approach to the par-five closing hole short. Alliss, meanwhile, split the fairway with his drive, then swished the smoothest of irons just in front of the green. Then, disaster. \"Alliss fatally decided to use a pitching club instead of a putter or straight faced iron ... he fluffed his shot,\" reported our man PWT. \"He put the next two feet from the hole. Turnesa holed out in three more anxious-looking shots, and then in tremendous silence poor Alliss missed the hole and victory once more became a dream.\"</p> <p>The hole halved in bogey six, the match lost, the chance of an outright British win gone. \"I made an awful bodge of it,\" Alliss would recall years later. \"I've had to live my whole life with the guilt of messing up that chip.\" Still, a win in the last match would ensure the consolation of a tie, even if the US would retain the cup anyway. Hunt, one up thanks to his opponent's errant drive on 17, just required a half. Both he and Douglas made it to the final green in regulation, roughly 30 feet from the cup. Hunt lagged his first putt to within three feet. Douglas two-putted for his par, meaning all Hunt had to do was tap in to win the match, and level the overall scores. But he couldn't make the shortest shot. \"High above the great trees, beyond the sun-filled sky of evening, one could almost hear the mocking laughter of the gods mingled with American sighs of relief.\" Britain would have to wait a wee while longer yet to regain the cup.</p> <p>But Alliss and Hunt could take at least some consolation from the fact that the pressures of the Ryder Cup can get to any man. Upon accepting the trophy, the winning captain Mangrum, the war hero with two purple hearts, sucked long and hard on a cigarette, exhaled slowly, and announced that he would \"never ever captain an American team again because of the nine thousand deaths I suffered in the last hour\".</p> <h2>6) Tommy Bolt v Eric Brown (1957)</h2> <p>We can't leave poor Alliss and Hunt like that, so here's their feel-good story of redemption. Four years later, at Lindrick Golf Club in Rotherham, both lads \u2013 now men \u2013 were selected once more and pitched straight into battle in the opening match of the foursomes. They lost that match, but there was no shame in coming second best to the strong US pairing of Dow Finsterwald and that year's Masters champion Doug Ford. And anyway, the rest of the team did little better, the States taking what was fast becoming their trademark 3-1 lead going into the singles.</p> <p>The US team had been so certain of retaining the trophy that the PGA didn't bother to cancel the insurance they had taken out on it. This was premium hubris. Britain would come at the Americans at full pelt in the singles. They had illustrated just how desperately they wanted to end their 24-year wait for the cup before a single Titleist had been teed. Rees had dropped Faulkner and Weetman for the final day, and the latter had sent the toys sailing from the pram along the sort of high arc that'd make a Rory McIlroy drive look like a weekend hacker's topper. He moaned to journalists that he'd never play for Rees again. It would earn him a one-year playing ban.</p> <p>It wouldn't be the last tantrum of the day, though, nor the most spectacular. Rees sent out the street-tough Eric Brown in the opening match against Tommy Bolt. With the team already two points adrift, a win was crucial, but Britain had only managed one victory in the opening singles match in 11 previous attempts. Brown lost the opening hole, and scraped a half at the second, but by the 7th was three up, and gained a further hole on Bolt by lunch.</p> <p>Bolt clawed back to within two holes, but with the crowd cheering wildly at Brown's every swing, and according to Ward-Thomas \"exceeding courtesy\" whenever the American slipped up, the Scotsman never relinquished his lead, eventually recording a 4&amp;3 win. \"They are the most unfair crowd I have ever seen,\" spluttered Bolt afterwards. \"They cheered every time I missed a putt. How unsporting can you get?\" The American stormed off to the changing rooms, where he broke the shaft of his wedge over his knee in impotent rage. And you thought this all started at Kiawah in 1991.</p> <p>Britain had the wind in their sails. Peter Mills levelled the overall scores with a victory over Jack Burke. Then it was the turn of Alliss, whose contribution is somewhat bittersweet, but nonetheless crucial to the narrative. He bravely lost 2&amp;1 to Fred Hawkins, Ward-Thomas noting: \"It was sad that Alliss had to lose. In the whole match few had played as well. He <strong>fought</strong> back from three down to one up and then Hawkins, who was on the brink of collapse, produced a faultless finish of rare character that was just too good for him.\" The BBC's mellifluous poet is unlikely to agree, but this defeat added a delicious and wholly necessary zest to the win, for an ecstatic Hawkins had left the course with a click of the heel and a glide in his stride, only to be told that his team-mates had got themselves into an awful pickle behind him. \"I was concentrating on my match and I thought we were winning,\" he muttered, dead eyes staring into the distance as the enormity of what was unfolding hit home.</p> <p>And what was unfolding was this: Ken Bousfield beat Lionel Hebert 4&amp;3, the captain Rees mauled Ed Furgol 7&amp;6, Hunt beat Ford 6&amp;4, Christy O'Connor beat Finsterwald 7&amp;6, and Harry Bradshaw halved with Dick Mayer. Hunt's routing of the Masters champion was payback for the foursomes, and also a personal release from the pain of 1953. Rees' huge captain's contribution was just reward for his years of service, the Welshman having played in every cup since 1937 without once before tasting success.</p> <p>The way the points flooded in, it was Bousfield \u2013 informed of the importance of his match by the rested Faulkner \u2013 who sealed the deal for Britain. \"Those were the days before scoreboards and walkie-talkies,\" recalled Bousfield. \"All of us playing would have no idea what was happening if it wasn't for Max. We might have won without him, but he was magnificent that day. I'll never forget what he did.\" Where the petulant Weetman had got to while Faulkner was ignoring his own personal disappointment and putting in a shift for the team was not reported. Also missing in action due to temper issues was Bolt, who after turning his pitching wedge into several hundred matchsticks, had stormed off site, refusing to appear at the trophy presentation. At least Bolt's team-mates were big enough to congratulate their conquerors in the honourable fashion that, the odd scrape notwithstanding, has to this day remained a signature of this fine competition. \"We were properly thrashed,\" shrugged Ed Furgol. \"I think the British professionals are among the finest in the world,\" added US captain Jackie Burke.</p> <p>The last word went to Harry L Moffitt, head of the US PGA and presumptive policy purchaser, who in his after-dinner speech threw in this zinger, a mix of self-deprecation and defiance: \"Don't bother to insure the trophy. We hope to have it back soon.\" Cue a 28-year stroll over barren terrain for the Brits. But that's another chapter ...</p>",
