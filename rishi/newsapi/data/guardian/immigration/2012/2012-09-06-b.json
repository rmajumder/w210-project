  "<p>All the best male-female pop partnerships teasingly hint at romance,&#xa0;and this collaboration between David Byrne and Annie Clark, aka <a href=\"http://ilovestvincent.com/\" title=\"\">St Vincent</a>, is no exception. Sometimes it's on the surface, in the seductive push and pull of their voices in Lazarus; sometimes it's subtler, buried in the tantalising intermingling of songwriting limbs. When Ice Age, sung by Clark, begins to sound like a <a href=\"http://www.talking-heads.nl/\" title=\"\">Talking Heads</a> song, or her guitar flickers across <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM1xLplCOmg\" title=\"\">Who</a>, you get the peculiar sensation they are wearing each other's clothes. That said, mostly&#xa0;their aesthetics seem to be spliced rather than shared, and hers \u2013 exemplified in the tender Optimist \u2013 tends to be dominated by his: exuberant, febrile, a riot of rippling percussion (I Am An Ape) and joyful brass (The One Who Broke Your Heart). By the end, the couple they most resemble is Peter Pan and Tinkerbell, for he is eternally youthful in his restless invention, and while she seems soft and wispy, up close she glints like a razor blade.</p>",

While he is correct about this, his letter also refers to an outdated study of his, which argued that previous estimates of overall Antarctic warming were too high. In fact, the work of Lewis and co-authors has been proven wrong.</p> <p>The relevant paper here is Orsi et al, <a href=\"http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2012/2012GL051260.shtml\" title=\"\">Geophysical Research Letters, vol. 39, 2012</a>, which shows that the rate of warming in west Antarctica is as great, or greater, than what we showed in our original work (<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v489/n7414/full/nature11483.html\" title=\"\">Steig et al</a>, Nature, vol. 457, 2009). Moreover, Lewis's own paper shows there has been significant warming in west Antarctica and that the average trend over Antarctica is of warming, not cooling as is often stated.</p> <p>The reality is that the Antarctic is warming up and is contributing significantly to sea level rise; and that there is strong potential for a greater contribution to sea level rise from Antarctica in the future. <br><a href=\"http://earthweb.ess.washington.edu/~steig/\" title=\"\"><strong>Professor Eric Steig</strong></a><br><em>University of Washington, Seattle, USA</em></p> <p>\u2022 Even as scientists report a record Arctic ice melt \u2013 indicating that man-made climate change is progressing at a faster pace than had been anticipated \u2013 the coalition continues to signal its readiness to spend taxpayers' money, no matter how harmful or ineffective (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/05/heathrow-battle-third-runway-ministers?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Heathrow runway row</a>, 5 September).

  "<h2>Live International Football<br>7.30pm, ITV1<br></h2> <p>After their customary quarter-final exit at the recent European Championships, Roy Hodgson's plucky though technically limited England are now charged with not botching up qualification for the World Cup in a group that looks a touch tricky. Moldova, ranked 137 in the world and first up tonight, aren't expected to pose much of a threat, but awkward ties against Ukraine, Poland and Montenegro loom on the horizon. Adrian Chiles hosts. <em>Gwilym Mumford</em></p> <h2>Celebrity Big Brother: Final<br>9pm, Channel 5<br></h2> <p>This has been a vintage Celebrity Big Brother, with plenty of spats, flesh and flirting. Brian Dowling presides over a final where it's hard to predict the winner, but this year's queen has to be Jasmine Lennard. Yes, she was the first to be evicted, but she played it like a pantomime and upset as many housemates as possible in the name of \"keeping it real, yah?\" It's likely that the grown-ups will go the distance, with Martin Kemp, Julian Clary and Julie Goodyear having a lot more likability than bikini-clad Daily Star fodder such as Danica Thrall and Rhian Sugden. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p> <h2>Full Metal Jousting<br>9pm, History<br></h2> <p>This is not, this US series warns us, the quaint simulations of jousting offered at themed Merrie England dining evenings, but the real thing, \"like riding through hell and riding out the other side\". Sixteen would-be latterday knights, ranging from a Marine Corps vet to a professional show jumper, divide into teams and lance it out for the chance to win $100,000. The more you learn about the guys, however, for whom this is a money-making opportunity in hard times, the less you yearn for them to gore each other. <em>David Stubbs</em></p> <h2><strong>Parade's End</strong><br>9.30pm, BBC2</h2> <p>Given its source material, authorship and fine cast \u2013 not to mention the combined resources of the BBC and HBO \u2013 Tom Stoppard's five-part adaptation of Ford Madox Ford's sequence of first world war novels had to be better than average. And indeed it is, though it's hard not to think, while watching this third episode, it might have been more absorbing had it been not quite as oppressively keen to emphasise its superiority: everything is just that little bit overplayed. Tonight, the all-too-perfect Christopher (Benedict Cumberbatch) falls victim to some savage rumour-mongering. <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p> <h2><strong>Here Comes the Summer: The Undertones Story</strong><br>9.45pm, BBC4<br></h2> <p>Did anybody ever sound quite like the Undertones, with that raw combination of crunching chords, and Feargal's singular vocal style, like a sheep having an orgasm? This profile of the Northern Irish parka-clad scamps aims to show there was more to them than just John Peel's favourite song. Interviews with band members, family and friends reveal the story behind the pop-punkers who gave us the likes of My Perfect Cousin, Jimmy Jimmy and It's Going To Happen, before \"musical differences\" rent them asunder. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2><strong>For the Win</strong><br>10pm, BBC3<br></h2> <p>Fans of the underrated Snuff Box will be delighted at the prospect of For the Win, another pop at the surreal sketch show featuring the excellent and slightly creepy Rich Fulcher. He joins a cast including John Hopkins, Lizzie Daykin and London Hughes with knowingly peculiar material penned by Matt Stronge and Hopkins. There's Embarrassing Bodies on Ice, a talking nipple called Reg and a resurgence of the bumbag, while Lizzie has some relationship issues and so decides to buy herself a python. Some of this works, some doesn't. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p>",
  "<p>In January of this year the parents of the exiled Iranian actor Golshifteh Farahani took a call at their apartment in Tehran from a man who said he was an official of the supreme court of the Islamic Republic. He began shouting at her father, telling him that his daughter would be punished, that her breasts would be cut off and presented to him on a plate.</p> <p>A few days earlier, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFJ9IChKF90\" title=\"\">Farahani had appeared in a short black-and-white video</a> with 30 other \"young hopes\" of the French cinema to promote the C\u00e9sars, the \"French Oscars\", where she had been nominated for her role in the winsome immigrant comedy <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2L8m3Agtvg\" title=\"\">Si Tu Meurs, Je Te Tue (If You Die, I'll Kill You)</a>. The promo had each actor take off an item of clothing as they stared into the camera to commit their \"body and soul\" to their art. Farahani chose to bare her right breast, saying: \"I will put flesh to your dreams.\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oFJ9IChKF90?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oFJ9IChKF90\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>What followed in Iran was little short of a cultural earthquake. \"It was a catastrophe,\" she remembers, her head dropping into her hands. \"I don't know exactly how many tens of millions of people typed my name into Google the next day, I don't want to know \u2026\" A taboo of unimaginable proportions had been shattered, and not by some publicity-hungry provocateur, but by the most loved and admired actor in the country. Farahani may have only been another 29-year-old hopeful in France, but in Iran she became a star the moment she appeared in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0187809/\" title=\"\">Dariush Mehrjui's The Pear Tree</a> at 14. Eighteen films later there is more than a little of Garbo, Jeanne Moreau and Irene Papas about her: a rare beauty and intelligence married to a burning emotional honesty in a country where truth of any kind is hard to come by.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1113810/\" title=\"\">M for Mother</a> she seared herself into the national consciousness playing a pregnant woman gassed during the Iran-Iraq war, abandoned by her husband and now carrying \"a gift from God\" in her womb. Both rural and urban Iran embraced her as their down-to-earth hero: Golshifteh, the star without airs. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/marjane-satrapi\" title=\"\">Marjane Satrapi</a>, author of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2003/may/15/biography.iran\" title=\"\">Persepolis</a> who directed her in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1663321/\" title=\"\">Chicken with Plums</a>, says: \"She was not just Iran, she was the mother of Iran.\"</p> <p>The day the video was posted, when what she calls the \"fire\" started, the official Fars news agency in Tehran issued a communique lacerating her, saying that the pictures showed the \"hidden, disgusting face of cinema\". This kind of opprobrium had never before been poured on an artist, however much they had upset the regime. Her exile was now a banishment.</p> <p>Farahani had already been banned from working by the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance for not wearing a headscarf at the New York premiere of Ridley Scott's CIA thriller <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/126190/body.of.lies\" title=\"\">Body of Lies</a>, where, playing opposite Leonardo DiCaprio, she became the first Iranian actress to appear in a Hollywood film since the 1979 revolution.</p> <p>The film's critical take on the CIA \u2013 which overthrew Iran's last freely elected government in 1953 \u2013 cut little ice with the ayatollahs, who took her passport away as further punishment. Four years ago, with doors closing all around her amid a pre-election crackdown that would eventually spark the green revolution, Farahani fled to France after being in effect fined the impossible-to-pay sum of \u20ac2m. When she spoke out from Paris in favour of the failed green revolution, she was told not to return.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395794011\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/6/1346952522827/Farahani-in-About-Elly.-010.jpg\" alt=\"Farahani in About Elly.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Farahani in About Elly. Photograph: Everett Collection/Rex Featu</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection/Rex Featu</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a final twist of the knife, the censors banned the last film she made there, Asghar Farhadi's <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1360860/\" title=\"\">About Elly</a>, even before it was shown. Like many before her, Farahani had quietly ignored the ban to take the lead role, hoping it would all blow over.</p> <p>Strangely, it would never have seen the light of day, nor have won the Silver Bear at Berlin, had it not been saved by an unlikely intervention from President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad himself, who said it was \"not fair that a film be condemned by the mistake of one actress\".</p> <p>But that was before she slipped her shoulder out of her shirt with the unconscious air of Delacroix's Liberty Leading the People and became a lightning conductor for the divisions within Iranian society. Ahmadinejad is never likely to be so forgiving again.</p> <p>Farahani insists, however, that she did not set out to shock or provoke. \"I hate politics. It is not my job. As always, something you do for nothing becomes political. I knew it would be difficult. But I am living in France now, I have to work here, and either I am living here or I am not.</p> <p>\"It was a big shock for me and my family and for the whole of Iranian society. The good thing is it started a huge debate that could never have happened before. I was there watching people insult me, others answering them, others defending me, others attacking again.</p> <p>\"There were lots of fights within families. Young people especially saw who they were through this debate, and they saw the reality of people they were trusting in.\"</p> <p>The collateral damage was nevertheless immense. Her father, a lion of a man, a communist theatre director and a dissident both under the shah and Khomeini, stopped talking for five days and had to be admitted to hospital after repeated threats. \"It was very bad. This was the first time they couldn't support me. The fire was so strong that they were also burning in it.</p> <p>\"I should be careful because I know they are being held hostage \u2026 But then after a while, because of the background of my father \u2013 who dragged himself up from very humble origins \u2013 their feelings began to change. My father was afraid I had lost the support of the people, which is very important to him, because he has spent his whole life battling for the people, sacrificing everything. But after a month or two he saw the people had more respect for me, and he became very happy.</p> <p>\"They even went to a wedding of nomads in the centre of Iran. Everyone from all the generations came to them and held their hands and said: 'Don't be sad. We love Golshifteh.' My mother started crying. That is the beauty of Iran, and that is why I am so proud of being an Iranian, especially the women.\"</p> <p>But Farahani doesn't want to be a \"Joan of Arc, an actress 'with a story', an exotic victim of persecution. Exile is like death. You cannot understand it until it happens to you. The whole world wants to see you as a victim and they push you to be even more a victim because they see you miserable and they feel good. That is why French people are so obsessed with causes like Syria. It is a kind of pornography to make them feel better about being themselves, but they don't give a shit. They say, 'Come, we will look after you,' and then they fuck you up and don't give you papers. I am just an actor, and I want to work.\"</p> <p>That said, she is hugely grateful to France. \"For the first time in my life I appreciated being a woman. Paris is a city that liberates you as a woman from all your sins that you think you are guilty of, it washes away all of that and you are free.\"</p> <p>She pulls a white scarf around her shoulders. It's her old headscarf, \"my old friend\". \"The biggest problem for Iranian actresses,\" she says is not the government but the world outside \"who think we come out of our mothers with our heads covered\".</p> <p>\"Look at <a href=\"http://uk.imdb.com/name/nm0368689/\" title=\"\">Leila Hatami</a>. Normally after winning an Oscar [for Farhadi's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/jun/30/a-separation-review\" title=\"\">A Separation</a>] you get lots of work. But nothing is happening and she speaks four languages.\"</p> <p>But Farahani won't be held. She has two more films coming out this autumn in France, a new road movie shot in the US with Sienna Miller, and the almost made-to-measure lead in Atiq Rahimi's The Patience Stone, which he adapted from his own Goncourt prize-winning novel about an Afghan woman standing guard over the body of her husband.</p> <p>Satrapi compares Farahani to Elizabeth Taylor at her height, but she is a better actor than Taylor: smarter, funnier and more at ease with herself, this is someone who, after spending her childhood welded to a piano, said no to the Vienna Conservatoire.</p> <p>For like her father, Farahani is a fundamentalist about art. She tells how Farhadi \"tortured\" her on the set of About Elly, forcing her to break her voice for the part, making her shout at the Caspian sea for half an hour every morning before shooting and swallow chickpea flour so she could only croak and rasp. Her eardrum was perforated in the beating she took from another actor and he refused to let her be treated till they finished the next day. They haven't spoken since. \"He's my friend but he cannot talk to me. He is still coming and going from Iran. I am evil now. Paranoia is part of how they control you.\"</p> <p>\"I have scars from every film I have made,\" she says, lifting her sleeve and leg to show me. \"There is nothing to protect actors. They treat you worse than a dog. You work like a slave, and you know I like it. That is the way it should be. Every film should be like your last.\"</p> <p><em>About Elly is released on 14 September</em></p>",
  "<p>David Cameron was on ITV Daybreak's comfy sofa to promote the coalition's latest relaunch (we must all build more conservatories) before breakfast yesterday, while Ed Miliband was in the City before lunch preaching something called \"pre-distributional\" politics (free conservatories). But, as so often, the day's heavy lifting was being done across the Commons dispatch box.</p> <p>Conscientious MPs crowded in to see if the rumour was true that Vince Cable has been placed under house arrest as part of the reshuffle. It was true, almost. The Lib Dems' leader-in-exile turned up for his monthly hour of business questions flanked by his new free market ministerial minders, \u2013 Labour's Chuka Umunna's label - Matt Hancock and Michael Fallon. Cable was not gagged as such, let alone tagged or even discreetly chained. He was allowed to give several answers, initially lacklustre but with growing confidence, faltering only when challenged about Cumbrian housing shortages by Tim Farron, his younger rival in the post-Clegg succession stakes. Sarcastic Labour cries of \"dream team\" may well have put him off his stroke.</p> <p>As always, the unscripted moments were most interesting, for a starlet was born. Not Hancock or Fallon \u2013 one a Dave 'n' George groupie, the other a Thatcher retread with distinctly bald tyres \u2013 but the token Lib Dem newcomer on the squad, Jo Swinson, 32.</p> <p>Whereas the brainy pair clung to their key stage 3 civil service scripts, anodyne stuffed shirt answers way beyond a fault, Swinson was perky and even sympathetic to MPs on all sides who were voicing alarm that coalition zeal for markets may stuff Britain's remaining post offices. Well done, Jo. Perhaps she is the post-Clegg leader? Just kidding, Nick. As so often after a mass sacking, the mood was kind. For instance, there was cross-party praise for the outgoing further education minister, John Hayes, switched to the energy brief.</p> <p>Labour's Ian Mearns (Gateshead) actually said of minister Fallon, an ex-MP for Darlington, that \"at least he knows where the north-east is\". Fallon is now safely installed in Sevenoaks, so this was generous.</p> <p>But it was nothing to the tributes lavished on Sir George Young, deposed as leader of the Commons after a mercurial career that has seen him sacked and recalled by Mrs T, then raised from the near-dead by Cameron, a fellow pupil at what Olympic rowing fans now call Eton Dorney comprehensive. And what better way to demoralise Young's successor, Andrew Lansley, than to praise his martyred predecessor as a champion of parliament?</p> <p>Lansley took it well: if he had been half as gracious at health he might still be RoboCop to the NHS. Pummelled on subjects ranging from banned Lancashire Morris dancers to the disbanded 2nd battalion of Fusiliers, he was politely cautious. Then when invited to condemn a limp-wristed judge he more or less told Tory \"libertarian\" Phil Davies to get stuffed. This was a promising start.</p> <p>Less propitious was the conservatory liberation statement made later by Eric Pickles. With his cropped hair and chilly demeanour Pickles looks like another Eric: Eric von Stalhein, the villainous German spy in countless Biggles adventure stories.</p> <p>Von Pickles made much of the \"common sense\" and \"practical measures\" that he will be unleashing to revive the Labour-battered construction industry. The Green Belt will be safe with him, he assured MPs, before explaining that local authorities will be able to tweak the belt a bit to build new homes on it.</p> <p>Hilary \"Biggles\" Benn, his Labour shadow, was having none of the blather. For all his talk of localism von Pickles is taking the power to strip councils of their control over planning decisions if they don't do what he wants, protested Biggles. In desperate response von Pickles played the class card, which may well explain his survival in an Eton Dorney cabinet.</p> <p>All very well for a millionaire aristo like Benn with his rolling acres, he replied. But \"I speak as a working class lad who is proud to own a detached house whose garden is smaller than your croquet lawn.\"</p> <p>Duh? The croquet lawn is not a contest this cabinet can win.</p>",

Address immigration which is a huge issue for Indian Americans, Asian Americans and the Latino community.</p> <p>\"Education \u2013 he's been a supporter of education, as we know, and healthcare, of course. The Affordable Care Act, we just love it in Michigan, because we have a large uninsured population, and we're very pleased about it, but expand it to include the 4 or 5 million people who would not be covered, so a single payer would be great.\"</p> <h2>Larry Capp, Miami, Florida<br>Psychologist</h2> <p>\"I'm really looking forward to President Obama's speech.

  "<p>Barack Obama should be losing the 2012 presidential election \u2013 or so says the conventional wisdom. With <a href=\"http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000\">unemployment above 8%</a>, a recovery that is mediocre at best and economic uncertainty far more the rule than the exception, there is certainly something to this argument. Yet, <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/\">according to polling guru Nate Silver</a>, President Obama is currently a 76% favorite for re-election.</p> <p>So why does Obama continue to maintain a small, yet stubborn lead not only in <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/p/2012-election/polls/president\">general election polling</a>, but \u2013 more importantly \u2013 in a <a href=\"http://www.quinnipiac.edu/institutes-and-centers/polling-institute/presidential-swing-states-%28fl-oh-and-pa%29/release-detail?ReleaseID=1781\">majority of key swing states</a>? It's the same reason he should be losing the presidential race: his Republican opponents.</p> <p>That might seem like a confusing explanation, but it's emblematic of the extent to which the GOP has been Obama's worst enemy over the past four years while, at the same time, may ensure that he is re-elected president.</p> <p>To unpack this admittedly convoluted argument, let's begin with focusing on the dominant political dynamic of the past four years. It's not about President Obama's legislative agenda or his post-partisan dreams, but rather the unceasing and unprecedented obstructionism of the Republican party. From day one of his presidency (actually, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/post/biden-mcconnell-decided-to-withhold-all-cooperation-even-before-we-took-office/2012/08/10/64e9a138-e302-11e1-98e7-89d659f9c106_blog.html\">even before Obama took office</a>), Republicans made the conscious decision to not just simply oppose Obama's entire policy agenda, but to actively and flagrantly thwart it. They promiscuously used the filibuster to block <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jul/12/news/la-pn-republicans-block-smallbusiness-tax-break-on-procedural-vote--20120712\">even the holding of votes on Democratic proposals in the Senate</a> and punished party members who contemplated the idea of working together with Obama or \u2013 even worse \u2013 compromising with him.</p> <p>Indeed, that Obama was even able to pass an <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-05/are-we-better-off-there-s-no-easy-answer.html\">$800bn stimulus measure</a> and <a href=\"http://www.healthcare.gov/law/index.html\">comprehensive healthcare reform</a> is perhaps the single most surprising political story, not just of the past four years, but indeed the past 40.</p> <p>The Republicans' obstructionist \"successes\" have taken a heavy toll and can be seen most dramatically in US economic performance since 2009. When fiscal policy has been expansive \u2013 as in the case of the stimulus being passed only a few weeks after Obama took office \u2013 the result has been <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/did-the-stimulus-work-a-review-of-the-nine-best-studies-on-the-subject/2011/08/16/gIQAThbibJ_blog.html\">job creation and economic growth</a> (albeit of the more tepid variety). When Congress has adopted GOP-favored policies of austerity \u2013 spending cuts and reliance on tax cuts to stimulate the economy \u2013 the results have been far worse. By consistently opposing and blocking any effort by Obama and the Democrats to grow the economy through additional stimulus measures, like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/12/republicans-defeat-obama-jobs-bill\">the president's job bill</a>, and even seeking to intimidate the Federal Reserve into focusing its attention on inflation rather than unemployment, they have actively undermined policies with the potential to spark an economic turnaround.</p> <p>While one can debate the morality of such an approach, the political results speak for themselves. An underperforming economy has harmed the president's political prospects and made him far more vulnerable to defeat than he would have been if Republicans had supported or, at least, not completely obstructed his stimulus efforts. This creates a rather disturbing political dynamic: namely, that the GOP strategy of obstructing Obama's agenda was political savvy and their only real hope of ensuring his defeat in 2012.</p> <p>Opposition was the only real alternative for a party intent on taking back the White House in four years, and it certainly helped Republicans to take back the house in 2010.</p> <p>Had Republicans been more supportive of his agenda, or at least allowed the Senate to hold votes on it, the economy would likely be in better shape and Obama would be in a far better position for re-election. From that perspective, obstructionism has been a net political plus for the GOP.</p> <p>But obstruction is not opposition, and this is where Republicans have left the door open for Obama. By giving the president no support for even the smallest bits of legislation (<a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/06/25/120625fa_fact_klein\">including programs they once supported</a>) and by not even allowing votes in the Senate on the president's agenda, they went from loyal oppositionists to relentless and partisan scolds \u2013 a point brilliantly <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0912/80808.html?hp=t1_b1\">reiterated by former President Clinton in his speech at the Democratic convention Wednesday night</a>.</p> <p>This is the downside to the GOP's four-year scorched-earth policy. By adopting such extreme anti-Obama positions, by taking the stance that any and all efforts to use the resources of the federal government to grow the economy are incipient socialism, and by making the political defeat of Obama, rather than just his policies, the party's central priority has opened up Republicans to the charge that they have been needless obstructionists who had no plan of their own for fixing the economy. It's hard not to see Romney's failure to offer any serious policy proposals for turning the economy around at his own convention as evidence of a party that refuses to contemplate any policy that doesn't include cutting taxes or shrinking regulation.</p> <p>So the same radical anti-government forces that push Republicans to reject every element of President Obama's policy agenda also make it impossible for the party's standard-bearer to offer voters anything more than empty platitudes.</p> <p>Far worse, the GOP has learned the hard way that, metaphorically, if you lie down with dogs, you get fleas. Implicit acceptance of the far right's narrative of Obama as an America-hating socialist has activated the GOP's most radical wing of voters. Republicans took a position not simply of implacable hostility to Obama's policies, but to the man himself. As these extreme voices have increased their influence within the party, they've moved Republicans <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/12/michael-cohen-republicans-embrace-extreme-right\">further and further to the uncompromising right on a host of issues</a> \u2013 from immigration to birth control and abortion \u2013 forcing their party's nominee to take policy positions that alienate even those voters disappointed in Obama's economic performance and inclined to look elsewhere.</p> <p>Perhaps the greatest cost of this approach is that while polls show that <a href=\"http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2012/election_2012_presidential_election/trust_on_issues_obama_v_romney\">voters believe Romney would be a better steward of the economy</a>, they view Obama as someone who is <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/08/solid-chances-serious-challenges-greet-romney-at-his-convention/\">more likely to favor the middle class and is more in touch with the challenges that affect them directly</a>. That reservoir of trust, combined with the GOP's paucity of ideas, might just be enough for Obama to slide in for a second term.</p> <p>Finally, by adopting such stridently oppositionist positions, not just against Obama but against the notion that the federal government had any responsibilities beyond shrinking itself into oblivion, Republicans have provided a boost to the Democrats' vision of government. Voters <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/151490/Fear-Big-Government-Near-Record-Level.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=syndication&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_term=Business%20-%20Politics\">may still recoil habitually at the idea of big government</a>, but they almost certainly recoil even further from the uncompromising alternative offered by the GOP. In desperate pursuit of political advantage, they have given Obama and the Democrats an opportunity to capture the political middle and redefine liberalism in terms that make it more palatable to a broad cross-section of voters.</p> <p>This is only one part of the long-term damage. By adopting stances of such rigid ideological purity, by needlessly offending the fastest growing minority groups in the country, as well as young voters, and, finally, by basing the party's short-term renaissance on the oldest and most reactionary voters, Republicans have left themselves in a political no-man's land, should they lose this election. Rebuilding a party that has bet its entire political future on unceasing hostility to Obama will not be so easy. In the end, Republicans placed all their chips on seeking to defeat Obama's agenda and, above all, Obama himself. That opposition has brought with it consequences that might not only backfire on election day, but may well also ensure that the GOP spends more than just four more years toiling in the political wilderness. </p> <p>For Obama, Republican hostility has left him bruised and in far worse shape politically than perhaps he should be in. But as he gives his acceptance speech at the Democratic national convention, he has the opportunity to turn the tables on those who have sought so lustily to thwart him. I'm guessing he won't miss the opportunity.</p>",
  "<p>The arrival in cinemas today&#xa0;of the period drama Anna Karenina marks the end of the summer blockbuster season \u2013 that annual orgy of expensive, CGI-heavy motion pictures. The Hollywood studios long ago started preparing their basket of treats for next summer, but that won't stop them trying to make sense of what just happened: what worked, what didn't, and what lessons can be learned.</p> <h2><strong>Winner: Superheroes</strong></h2> <p>Audience affection for comic-book crime fighters is nothing new, but the genre's dominance in summer 2012 reached new heights, providing three of the top-five UK box-office hits. That's a big step up from summer 2011, when X-Men: First Class, Captain America: The First Avenger and Thor all failed to crack the summer top 10. Warner Bros will be pleased that, in the UK at least, The Dark Knight Rises out-grossed its predecessor (in the US, it is still $100m behind), and Sony will be happy with the performance of its Spider-Man reboot. Top prize, however, goes to Disney and Marvel: their Avengers Assemble augurs well for the seemingly endless stream of Marvel movies on their way.</p> <h2><strong>Loser: Dance flicks</strong></h2> <p>When StreetDance 2 sputtered to just \u00a33.1m at the UK box-office \u2013 a steep, steep fall from StreetDance's \u00a311.6m \u2013 commentators wondered whether it signalled the end for the genre, or was just a blip. An even worse performance for Step Up 4: Miami Heat a couple of months later \u2013 \u00a32.6m, down from a franchise high of \u00a310.6m with Step Up 2 the Streets \u2013 suggests it really is all over for PG-rated romances populated by plucky, sportswear-attired youngsters acrobatically battling for ego, honour and sheer anti-establishment joie-de-vivre.</p> <h2><strong>Winner: Channing Tatum</strong></h2> <p>While Step Up faltered, the franchise's&#xa0;original male star soared to&#xa0;new heights. Magic Mike's $113m US&#xa0;box-office success in June meant that Tatum had delivered three consecutive $100m-plus grosses in the&#xa0;US in less than six months \u2013 following The Vow ($125m) and 21 Jump Street ($138m).</p> <h2><strong> Loser: Dr Seuss</strong></h2> <p>In America, they love Theodor Seuss Geisel, and every child seems to know all about the Grinch, the Cat in the Hat and the Hortons of Whoville. Over here, not so much. While Dr Seuss' The Lorax grossed a decent $214m Stateside, in the UK it has struggled, with \u00a37.3m so far. It didn't even match the UK box-office for Horton Hears a Who (\u00a38.7m), considered at the time to be a disappointment.</p> <h2><strong>Winner: Original stories</strong></h2> <p>Yes, of course the summer box-office chart is dominated by sequels and films based on what Hollywood rejoices in calling \"existing material\", but the presence of two films in the top 10 (Ted and Brave) featuring original characters is vaguely heartening. Less encouragingly, these two hits benefited from the cachet of the brands behind them \u2013 Pixar, and Family Guy creator Seth Macfarlane \u2013 and are in genres (animation, comedy) that have traditionally proved more open to original ideas.</p> <h2><strong>Loser: Jump-starting the summer&#xa0;in spring</strong></h2> <p>Hollywood studios have long grumbled about the craziness of concentrating so many expensive pictures into the four&#xa0;months of the summer movie season, which runs from May to August. This year, thanks to Euro 2012 football and the Olympics turning chunks of the summer schedule into virtual no-go areas, they had the perfect opportunity to try a different tack. Disney released John Carter in March, and Universal unleashed Battleship in the UK in April. Loss-making final grosses of \u00a34.7m and \u00a37.5m resulted.</p> <h2><strong>Winner: Secret Cinema</strong></h2> <p>With its themed presentations of movie classics in limited runs at unusual locations, Secret Cinema long&#xa0;ago hit on an original formula fusing cinema with live participatory theatre. How to grow profit remained a challenge, but the organisation's presentation in June of its first new-release blockbuster, Prometheus, delivered a win for all parties. With 38 showings spread out over a secrecy-challenging 28 days, Secret Cinema achieved box-office of \u00a3730,000, and established a model for the future.</p> <h2><strong> Loser: Foreign language</strong><br></h2> <p>Away from the intense competition of awards season, the summer can usually be relied upon to deliver a big foreign-language hit, and past successes include La Vie En Rose, Coco Before Chanel and Tell No One. This summer, outside of Asian martial arts actioner The Raid and Bollywood, there were no significant foreign successes. Instead, documentaries (in the English language) stepped up to occupy the space, with impressive grosses for both The Imposter (\u00a3694,000 so far) and Searching for Sugar Man (\u00a3331,000).</p> <h2><strong>Winner: Scotland</strong></h2> <p>The film market may be global, but it's also national. In most of the UK, Ken Loach's The Angels' Share was positioned as another critically acclaimed offering from one of the country's most celebrated auteurs, albeit one of his more lighthearted efforts. In Scotland, the whisky caper was presented in a mainstream way as the country's answer to The Full Monty, and played every multiplex. Of the \u00a31.9m final UK and Ireland gross, 72% was achieved north of the border. With Brave, Disney achieved 19.4% of its UK/Ireland total in Scotland, as against 8% for a typical Pixar film.</p> <h2><strong>Top 10 films in UK, summer 2012</strong><br></h2> <p><strong>1</strong> The Dark Knight Rises, \u00a354.5m</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Marvel Avengers Assemble, \u00a351.8m</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Ice Age 4: Continental Drift, \u00a329.1m</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Ted, \u00a328.1m</p> <p><strong>5</strong> The Amazing Spider-Man, \u00a325.8m</p> <p><strong>6</strong> Prometheus, \u00a324.7m</p> <p><strong>7</strong> Men in Black 3, \u00a322.0m</p> <p><strong>8</strong> Brave, \u00a317.9m</p> <p><strong>9</strong> American Pie: Reunion, \u00a316.8m</p> <p><strong>10</strong> Snow White and the Huntsman, \u00a315.8m</p>",
  "<h2><strong>A third Heathrow runway</strong></h2> <p><strong>Why?</strong> The solution most in aviation favour. Bar the politics, the most deliverable option, to be funded through private investment.</p> <p><strong>Why not?</strong> Puts another swath of west London directly under a flight path, and blights thousands more. Transport secretary Justine Greening stood against it \u2013 and lost her job in the cabinet reshuffle earlier this week. Some argue \u2013 even Willie Walsh, boss of British Airways' parent company IAG, concurs \u2013 it's not a long-term answer to a lack of hub capacity, an airport big enough for connecting flights that make long-haul services feasible.</p> <h2><strong>Combine with Gatwick </strong></h2> <p><strong>Why?</strong> Connect the two biggest London airports with a high speed rail link and voila, a super-hub, \"Heathwick\". Second runway plans are drawn up; there are fewer people in the vicinity.</p> <p><strong>Why not?</strong> A train ride too far for transfer passengers, so would not deliver the solution to the hub question. Any movement ruled out until 2019.</p> <h2><strong>A second Stansted runway</strong></h2> <p><strong>Why?</strong> The best option according to Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary, who believes that when BAA sells it and new owners invest, the fall in passenger numbers will be reversed. It's in Essex, not on the edge of prime west London real estate. There's more space for expansion.</p> <p><strong>Why not?</strong> Poor connections to London. Without major investment in all the infrastructure and a shift in its low-cost reputation, its appeal will continue to dwindle.</p> <h2><strong>Boris Island \u2013 a Thames estuary airport</strong></h2> <p><strong>Why</strong>? The most advanced of all proposals, with a blueprint from Norman Foster. It would, says Boris Johnson, revitalise east London and deafen fewer people.</p> <p><strong>Why not?</strong> Revitalise the east, yes, and destroy the west by closing Heathrow. Risk of bird strikes. Lack of infrastructure. Unexploded bombs on the nearby sunken SS Richard Montgomery. Plus if Boris swings this, he'll be PM.</p> <h2><strong>Another new hub in the home counties</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Why?</strong> More accessible than the estuary. Rumours Oxfordshire is under consideration. An ancestor of the Howard Davies commission, the Roskill commission, concluded in 1971 that Cublington, Buckinghamshire, was the best place. Government ignored that one too.</p> <p><strong>Why not?</strong> Enormous bill, decades of work, Nimby central.</p> <h2><strong>A bigger role for regional airports</strong></h2> <p><strong>Why?</strong> The likes of Birmingham have plenty of spare capacity. If aviation brings benefits, why not spread them? Would save people from chugging down the motorway to Heathrow.</p> <p><strong>Why not?</strong> As Heathrow boss Colin Matthews likes to point out, if airlines wanted to fly to Birmingham, there's nothing stopping them. Government can't artificially create demand.</p> <h2><strong>Do nothing</strong></h2> <p><strong>Why?</strong> Constrain demand and you'll get less noise, cleaner air, a less rapidly melting Arctic ice cap, and fewer votes lost in west London marginals.</p> <p><strong>Why not?</strong> People will still fly, just via hub airports in Europe. Britain will lose the economic benefits and the CO<sub>2</sub> will be pumped out regardless.</p>",
  "<p>Sarah Storey joined the ranks of Britain's greatest ever Paralympians on Thursday, winning her fourth cycling gold medal of the London Games in the women's road race in an utterly imperious ride that saw her finish more than seven minutes ahead of her closest rival.</p> <p>So dominant was the 34-year-old from Cheshire in the 64km race that by the second lap of the Brands Hatch course, having left the women's field far behind her, she caught and passed the peloton of the men's road race, which had started two minutes earlier.</p> <p>Her victory, the 11th gold of a career spanning six Paralympic Games, equals the modern-era records of wheelchair racer Tanni Grey-Thompson and swimmer Dave Roberts. But the cyclist's tally is all the more remarkable given that she began her Paralympics career, as a 14-year-old at the Barcelona Games, as a swimmer, winning two golds and three silvers in her debut appearance in 1992. London is her second Games competing as a cyclist \u2013 she won double gold in Beijing in her track and time trial debut.</p> <p>Speaking immediately after the race, Storey said she was \"just so chuffed\" to have matched in the road racing the two golds she won in the velodrome, after taking time trial gold with an almost equally comfortable win on Wednesday.</p> <p>\"The crowds around the course, and coming into the finish straight every single lap, I wanted to be able to say 'thank you', but obviously I had to keep my head down, make sure I made no mistakes.\"</p> <p>The race \"hurt a lot but it was amazing\", added Storey, who was able to savour her success by free-wheeling across the line.</p> <p>\"The Americans went off to send everyone up the road one at a time. I decided to test some legs. I had a bit of gas to spare, so I dug in \u2013 62km on my own.\"</p> <p>Asked about equalling the records of Roberts and Grey-Thompson, Storey said: \"To be even on the same page \u2026 as Tanni, but to have won 11 and made today a clean sweep for this week is just a dream come true. I can't thank enough people. I'm so proud to be part of such an amazing team and I'm just so pleased to be finished now as well.\"</p> <p>Storey, who competed as Sarah Bailey before her marriage to the cyclist Barney Storey, was born with an underdeveloped left hand. She only narrowly missed selection for the team pursuit squad at the Olympic Games, with whom she has previously won World Cup medals.</p> <p>Together with the gold and silver medals won in the Paralympic velodrome by her husband, who rides as a sighted tandem pilot with Neil Fachie, Storey's latest gold would take the couple on their own to 20th place in the medals table, ahead of South Africa, New Zealand and Mexico.</p> <p>Storey credits her 35-year-old husband, whom she met through the sport in 2004, for much of her cycling success, saying: \"Barney's at the centre of my world, his expertise in cycling is just phenomenal. Before he was a tandem pilot he was an able-bodied solo sprinter, riding World Cup events, spring grands prix in Europe.</p> <p>\"Barney's got an immense knowledge and background in cycling. And when I came along, this big-shouldered, raw swimmer, he taught me everything.\"</p> <p>Speaking after Storey's time trial victory, which the cyclist said had been inspired by the performances of Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome in the Olympics road race, the Team GB coach Shane Sutton said her achievement was \"right up there\" with the performances of Chris Hoy and Usain Bolt in the earlier Games. \"What she has achieved is incredible. She is as good as any able-bodied cyclist around at the moment.\"</p> <p>He said he would not be surprised if Storey were to qualify for the able-bodied competition in Rio in four years' time, when the women's pursuit team expands from three to four riders.</p>",
  "<p>The spectre of war in the Caucasus rose again this week following the pardoning by Azerbaijan of a convicted axe murderer who killed and all but decapitated an Armenian soldier while he slept. The White House, Russia, the EU and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe all moved to diplomatic battle stations as the Armenian president, Serzh Sargsyan, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/05/world/europe/pardon-reignites-azerbaijan-armenia-tensions.html\" title=\"\">furiously warned</a>: \"We don't want a war, but if we have to, we will fight and win.\"</p> <p>The case of Ramil Safarov, an Azeri army lieutenant who was jailed in Hungary in 2004 for the murder of Gurgen Margaryan during a Nato Partnership for Peace course that they both attended, has inflamed public opinion in Azerbaijan and Armenia. The two countries have a history of hostilities that includes a war over the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave that killed 30,000 people between 1988 and 1994. The dispute remains unresolved and this summer there was a sharp escalation in border skirmishes.</p> <p>The alarm in Washington and Moscow at the latest confrontation is rooted in political and strategic considerations.</p> <p>Thanks to the efforts of former US vice-president Dick Cheney, among others, Azerbaijan has become a major oil supplier to the west in recent years. US and British companies including ExxonMobil and BP have invested an estimated $35bn in its oil and natural gas fields and the country's importance has grown during the turmoil engendered elsewhere by the Arab spring.</p> <p>Nato, meanwhile, uses Azeri airfields to resupply Afghanistan. Azerbaijan's military spending, financed by oil sales, is expected to reach $3.6bn this year.</p> <p>Pro-western, pro-business Azerbaijan's location on the Caspian basin has also made it a key player in the Obama administration's undeclared war on Iran.</p> <p>Official US criticism of long-standing civil, electoral and human rights abuses by the government of President Ilham Aliyev is relatively muted. In return for its discretion, Washington is said to be rewarded with intelligence-sharing and other Iran-related favours.</p> <p>Up to 20 million ethnic Azeris live in north-western Iran and some Azeri politicians refer to the area as \"South Azerbaijan\". For CIA schemers intent on destabilising the Tehran regime, the potential for subterfuge is vast.</p> <p>The Israel-Azerbaijan relationship is even more remarkable. The two countries have steadily expanded military ties: Baku spent $1.6bn on Israeli weapons in February.</p> <p>Then in March Azerbaijan arrested 22 people allegedly involved in an Iranian plot to assassinate American and Israeli diplomats, and Aliyev claims Azerbaijan is neutral in the dispute over Iran's nuclear programme, which Israel believes threatens its existence. But Iran-Azerbaijan relations are in deep freeze amid a public war of words.</p> <p>Less wealthy Armenia also has strategic significance and powerful backers. Russia is a major weapons supplier, maintains military bases within reach of Armenia's border with Nato member Turkey, and oversees the country's air defences. Russian military flights increased sharply this year as Azeri-Armenian tensions rose, according to Interfax.</p> <p>It was announced in June that Russia would double its personnel at its Gyumri base, whose lease has been extended until 2044. Gyumri is home to Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles and Mikoyan MiG-29 fighters. Iran also takes Armenia's side in opposition to Azerbaijan \u2013 while just to complicate matters further, so too does the influential Armenian-American diaspora, which knows how to put pressure on the White House.</p> <p>Small surprise, then, that the feting of the axe murderer Safarov when he returned to Baku, his subsequent promotion, the awarding to him of eight years' back pay \u2013 and Armenia's furious reaction \u2013 have caused ripples of alarm at the highest levels. Armenia broke off diplomatic relations with hapless Hungary for letting him go, Barack Obama expressed deep concern about it all, the Kremlin chastised both Hungary and Azerbaijan, demonstrators took to the streets of Yerevan and an Armenian opposition party demanded formal recognition of the independence of Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan claimed in turn that Armenia's reaction was \"hysterical\" and that President Sargsyan had secretly ordered the assassination of Safarov.</p> <p>International diplomatic efforts to pull the two sides back from the brink appear to have worked so far, but more by luck than judgment. The Safarov affair is not over yet. And it is a sobering reminder that the so-called \"frozen conflicts\" left over from the Cold War can and will re-ignite with appalling speed if ignored for long enough.</p> <p>In point of fact, the dispute has not been wholly ignored. The so-called Minsk group of countries has been trying to resolve it for years. In June, the US, Russian and French presidents issued a joint statement calling for a peaceful settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute. \"Military force will not resolve the conflict and would only prolong the suffering and hardships endured by the peoples of the region for too long,\" they said. That is indubitably true. What they did not admit is their own part in the problem.</p>",
  "<p>The home secretary, Theresa May, has said the G4S Olympic security fiasco shouldn't discourage police forces from putting more of their services into the hands of the private sector.</p> <p>She also ruled out a review of the government's \u00a31bn contracts with the private security giant, which include running prisons, tagging of criminals and housing asylum seekers, saying the Olympic contract was \"rather different\" from G4S's \"day in, day out\" public-sector work.</p> <p>May's intervention on Thursday came as the Conservative-led Surrey police authority voted to withdraw completely from the \u00a31.5bn \"business partnering programme\" with the West Midlands force \u2013 the largest police privatisation project in England and Wales. G4S is on a six-strong shortlist bidding to take over a wide range of policing services, including detaining suspects, contributing to investigations and managing high-risk offenders.</p> <p>The Home Office's most senior civil servant, Dame Helen Ghosh, who is leaving the civil service at the end of this month, also told MPs on Thursday that the responsibility for the Olympics debacle rested entirely withG4S, which had failed to alert officials to staff shortages until just before the Games began.</p> <p>The company's chief executive, Nick Buckles, will face further questioning by the Commons home affairs select committee on 11 September to explain why the army and police had to be drafted in at the last minute after G4S failed to supply the required 10,400 staff. The failure turned an expected \u00a310m profit on the \u00a3283m contract into a \u00a350m loss.</p> <p>G4S is one of the government's largest suppliers. A rethink of its private delivery of public services appeared a possibility after the defence secretary, Philip Hammond, and the then culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt, both said the Olympic experience would make them reconsider outsourcing in some circumstances.</p> <p>But May ruled out any government-wide review when she appeared before the select committee on Thursday. She said she did not think it was necessary to sound alarm bells over G4S's performance. The Olympic contract had been closely monitored and was different to the policing services which G4S already provided.</p> <p>\"There are many forces looking at the role of the private sector in the delivery of policing services. If there are services that can be better provided by the private sector then they should do that,\" May told MPs, adding that roles which involved the power of a warranted police officer would not be allowed to go to the private sector.</p> <p>G4S was encouraged by a decision last week by Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire police to continue preparing a business case for a contract with the company to outsource 1,000 back-office jobs in the three forces.</p> <p>But the Surrey authority's decision is a further setback. West Midlands police authority has deferred selecting a private-sector partner until after the police commissioner elections on 15 November.</p> <p>Work is continuing on the programme so that the new commissioner \"has a range of options upon taking up office\". The Home Office, which is funding 40% of the costs of the privatisation initiative, is continuing to support the programme. Surrey's involvement has cost it \u00a3160,000.</p>",

Made up of just five multitasking products and a set of sturdy but sensibly sized brushes, the collection is aimed at busy women who want good quality but fuss-free makeup. Yes, similar products may be available elsewhere, but here they are all together, laid out in front of you in a simple, this-is-all-you-need-to-look-lovely way. The compact is somewhere between a foundation and a concealer (and comes in six shades), there's a gorgeous lip and cheek cr\u00e8me that gives a nice flush of colour, and the lip conditioner is thick and glossy. With a hand and body cream, and an illuminating powder to finish the collection, it really is a great selection of makeup basics.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395760789\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2012/9/6/1346939735821/Aerin-3---Anna-Chesters-c-007.jpg\" alt=\"Aerin 3 - Anna Chesters col\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">And relax \u2026 Aerin's Weekend set.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>As well as this Essentials collection, Aerin also launches an autumn collection. Two subtle palettes, lip glosses and lipsticks coming under the title of either Weekday or Weekend. Yes, there's a lipstick called Sunday Morning, which is slightly optimistic, but if you're a fan of nudes and barely there shades, then this is the stuff for you. And by giving a lip gloss the title Perfect Nude, my guess is that these won't be hanging around long in the limited collection before gaining permanent status.<br><em>Prices from \u00a322, <a href=\"http://www.esteelauder.co.uk/AerinBeauty/index.tmpl\">esteelauder.co.uk/aerin</a></em></p> <h2>Is this an end to wonky eyeliner?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395760790\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2012/9/6/1346940979452/Anna-Chesters-5-001.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Chesters 5\" width=\"230\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Almost a great solution \u2026 Bourjois' Intuitive Liner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I'm often wary of beauty brands presenting solutions to problems that none of us have, but <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/fashion/fashion-blog/2011/sep/22/brief-history-bourjois-fashion-beauty\">Bourjois</a> have obviously been listening to the crowd of women who struggle with liquid eyeliner.

  "<p>Blue skies, 40F temperatures, swirling green northern lights at night and old snow on the hills of northern Norway. The Greenpeace Arctic Sunrise spent Wednesday restocking in Troms\u00f8 harbour, but is now heading north, as far as possibly can.</p> <p>The plan is to steam to, and possibly then into, the furthest extent of the annual sea ice which right now is about 82-84 degrees north, about 500km from the north pole. Given good weather that's at least four days away in this much loved 37 year-old-tub. At least it's an ice breaker.</p> <p>But such is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/27/arctic-sea-ice-shrinks-lowest-extent\" title=\"\">the record annual sea ice melt this year</a>, it is not clear where the ice will be in a week's time, or when it will stop melting and start refreezing. Usually it starts to reform around 12 September, but it has been as late as 20 September.</p> <p>This year's melt has not just already broken recent records, it has comprehensively smashed them. The National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC), based in Boulder, Colorado, <a href=\"http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/2012/08/arctic-sea-ice-breaks-2007-record-extent/\" title=\"\">says it passed the 2007 record minimum extent of 4.17m sq kilometres on 26 August</a>.</p> <p>But satellite imagery shows a further 370,000 sq km has melted since then and now just 3.64m sq km remains. <a href=\"http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/2012/09/arctic-sea-ice-falls-below-4-million-square-kilometers/\" title=\"\">Data this week shows</a> the rate of melt slowing but the ice still losing 40,000 sq km a day. Cryologists [ice experts] talk of it possibly dropping below 3m sq km for the first time in possibly tens of thousands of years. If so, it would be a whopping 25% below <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/sep/04/climatechange\" title=\"\">the 2007 record minimum extent</a> and something that few ice experts ever thought could happen in their lifetimes.</p> <p>There's a sense of history unfolding, of heading into uncharted territory. And, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/14/met-office-arctic-sea-ice-loss-winter\" title=\"\">because the Arctic ice is thought to largely regulate climate in the northern hemisphere</a>, of unknown consequences.</p> <p>Some folk \u2013 though not on the Arctic Sunrise where pragmatism strictly rules \u2013 <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/09/05/799761/death-spiral-watch-experts-warn-near-ice-free-arctic-in-summer-in-a-decade-volume-trends-continue/\" title=\"\">are calling it a \"death spiral\"</a>, leading to ice-free summer waters within 20-30 years. The climate sceptics shrug the latest statistics off as just one more of many scares but the fact is that the decline of sea ice has faithfully mirrored the seeming inexorable rise in temperatures seen across the Arctic in recent years.</p> <p>The chances of the ice now melting way, way beyond anything expected this year are heightened by what is happening in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptev_Sea\" title=\"\">Laptev Sea</a> north of Siberia. Here, the ice is thin and already vulnerable. A low pressure system, it seems, is building there, which could bring on another major storm which in turn would break the ice pack up and make it more prone to melt. In a matter of a few days, hundreds of thousands of square kilometres of ice could disappear.</p> <p>There are now three ice scientists aboard, including Julienne Stroeve, a researcher with the NSIDC, and two from Cambridge university. They will each be conducting their own experiments and observations.</p> <p>Strove shows us data sets showing how vulnerable large parts of the ice mass has become. Ten years ago, she says, a good 30-40% was older than a year, meaning it was thicker and more resilient. This year it's nearly all only one year old. Even more remarkably, she shows us the temperature anomaly charts \u2013 much of this vast region is presently 2-6C above normal temperatures for this time of year.</p> <p>\"To see the ice disappear like this so quickly is unprecedented. I was around in 2002 when there was a jump. But it has just kept happening. Something has changed,\" she says.</p>",

Paul A Newman, chief scientist for Atmospheric Sciences at NASA Goddard estimates that there have only been about eight storms of similar strength during the month of August in the past 34 years of satellite records.

Each year, the ice cap goes through a shrink-and-swell cycle, melting throughout the summer months before expanding through fall and winter. In the past decade in particular the minimum summertime extent of the ice cap has shown a consistent decline in size a trend closely linked with the Arctic's warming climate.

Today, few remnants of Lahontan remain; most of its arms have become dry enclosed basins known as playas.

  "<p>So Andy and Tracey Ferrie, the couple held by police for three days after using a shotgun against burglars at their rural home, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/sep/05/couple-shooting-burglary-home-released\" title=\"\">are not to be prosecuted</a>. The tabloids rejoice and Chris Grayling, the new justice secretary, must be quietly relieved not to be drawn into a divisive (and tempting) controversy so early in his cabinet career.</p> <p>Newspapers like the Guardian and their readers tend not to get agitated by such cases, preferring to engage with those where more abstract features of the justice system are at stake \u2013 the rights of asylum seekers (not just a famous Julian Assange), or police abuse of procedure, including the use of firearms, against vulnerable people or suspected criminals.</p> <p>And rightly so. After PC Simon Harwood was acquitted of manslaughter in the case of Ian Tomlinson, the newspaper vendor killed during the G20 protests in 2009, it emerged there had been a series of complaints about his behaviour (though most were found unproven). The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) had initially declined to prosecute him until the findings of the pathologist Freddy Patel \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/aug/23/tomlinson-pathologist-freddy-patel-struck-off\" title=\"\">who also has past form</a> \u2013 were discredited. Harwood is still a police officer. A thoroughly disquieting case.</p> <p>But, if it is right for the Guardian to be tenacious in such cases, is it wrong for the Daily Mail to be fierce in standing up for people who defend their homes against intruders, often at night in frightening circumstances? I think so. Indeed, I suspect that more people get excited about the unfairness of the Ferries' detention than do about, say, the rights of the Islamist cleric <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/may/09/abu-qatada-deportation-appeal-rejected\" title=\"\">Abu Qatada</a> not to be deported home to Jordan.</p> <p>The Ferries, who live in an isolated 200-year-old cottage at Welby outside Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire, had been burgled several times before.</p> <p>No wonder the vigilante lobby stirs at times like this with complaints that the police are useless and the law biased against the law-abiding. It can feel like that when the cops appear to pick off easy targets to keep up their conviction rates and the CPS seems sloppy or supine.</p> <p>So when masked men burst in last weekend, Andrew Ferrie fired the shotgun, legally owned by his wife and kept in their bedroom, and injured one of the intruders in the hand. At Loughborough magistrates court on Wednesday, the injured man, Daniel Mansell, 33, pleaded guilty to burglary. He too has form for burglary, robbery and witness intimidation \u2013 he was released under probationary supervision last year after serving two years of a six-year sentence for a violent attack. Three other men were arrested.</p> <p>So far I am with the Ferries on this one, relieved only that the use of a weapon was effective, rather than being a prelude to a familiar tragedy in which the victims of a robbery who resist their assailants end up injured or dead. But it's a fine line. Tony Martin, the Norfolk farmer who fatally shot an intruder in the back as he fled, was jailed for murder, later reduced (rightly) to manslaughter, with five years in jail.</p> <p>Munir Hussain, the Buckinghamshire businessman who chased a burglar who had tied up his family and threatened them with a knife, caught him down the road and beat him with a cricket bat and metal pole. Hussain clearly overdid it. He must have been frightened and angry, but the intruder was no longer in his home. He got two and a half years, later reduced to a one-year suspended sentence. The burglar was not jailed either.</p> <p>David Cameron then promised a review of the law and routinely <a href=\"http://www.metro.co.uk/news/811069-burglars-forfeit-human-rights\" title=\"\">repeats that pledge</a>.</p> <p>Last year the CPS decided that a Manchester man who fatally stabbed a machete-wielding burglar would not be prosecuted. The tabloids were pleased. But those such as <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2198379/I-use-shotgun-burglar-I--law-side.html?ito=feeds-newsxml\" title=\"\">the Mail's fiery pundit Simon Heffer</a> who argue that the government should clarify the law through legislation have a point.</p> <p>It's tricky and risky for government. Grayling must be tempted to make his name in tough law-and-order posturing, unlike his predecessor, Ken Clarke, who sensibly wondered why the prison population had almost doubled since he was last home secretary in 1993. It's very expensive, complained Ken, who is also an ex-chancellor.</p> <p>Alas, it doubled because Michael Howard, Tony Blair, David Blunkett and co engaged in a law and order bidding war. Crime has gone down, they all say. And it has, but for more complex reasons than locking up people, many of whom should not be there. It's not a message the tabloids want their readers to understand.</p> <p>Today's lurid reporting of the judge who said <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2198621/It-takes-huge-courage-burgle-somebodys-house-What-judge-told-intruder-raided-homes-letting-walk-free-court.html?ito=feeds-newsxml\" title=\"\">it must take a desperate kind of courage to burgle a stranger's house</a> illustrates the problem. All the usual media suspects picked up the story with glee and outrage.</p> <p>The Mail's account included comments from outraged victims of burglary. But even that account gives enough information to explain why Judge Peter Bowers said what he said when he gave Richard Rochford a 12-month suspended sentence (plus 200 hours' community service and drug rehabilitation) at Teeside crown court.</p> <p>The accused was an amateur with a drug habit and robbed two unlocked homes while their occupants slept. He had co-operated with police and stopped using drugs, the court heard. \"I think prison rarely does anyone any good,\" said the judge, though the papers note that he is not wholly consistent on this point. Well, that's human nature too, but he's more right than wrong about prison, where rehabilitation programmes become harder the more crowded the system is.</p> <p>Whether he was right to give Rochford a second chance, only time will tell. And we will probably only get to hear about it if he's proved wrong and the law and order tabloids have a chance to get excited all over again.</p> <p>Perhaps the election of police and crime commissioners across England and Wales on 15 November will enhance the quality of debate on this subject. Let's hope so, because respect for the police, their competence and commitment, is currently low in neglected rural areas as well as in some big cities.</p> <p>As French police struggle to solve the murders near smart Annecy in the Alps in the coming days we will get a useful comparator. Here's <a href=\"http://www.bunker8.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/cjs/26903.htm\" title=\"\">one analysis</a> which reminds us how different the procedures are in otherwise similar countries. I hope the vigilante lobby is watching because I'm pretty sure our record in solving such murders is better than theirs.</p>",

But not the skanky plastic garbage peddled by Maccy D's, KFC and their ilk. Instead, I might have a crisp, lightly browned dosa (rice and lentil crepe) with coconut chutney for breakfast, pav bhaji (bread rolls with a buttery vegetable hash) for lunch and chaat (a spicy mix of potatoes, yoghurt, onions, tomatoes, cilantro and crispy bits) for a snack. Usually, these will cost me about Rs 50 (about 50p), less than a McDonald's veggie burger, which goes for Rs 59. They will be healthier, tastier, fresher.</p> <p>The recent <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/10423158\" title=\"\">announcement by McDonald's that it is launching a veggie restaurant in India</a> had me bellowing \"What fresh hell is this?\" It's the culinary equivalent of selling ice to Inuits. Inuits may not have more than a hundred words for snow \u2013 apparently it's an urban myth \u2013 but I can assure you that Indians have many more than a hundred varieties of veggie fast food, not just a plain one-size-fits-all potato patty.</p> <p>Oh, I have tried McDonald's veggie offerings, the ones carefully created for my primitive brown taste buds after years of research. Once. The dull <a href=\"http://cdn.gunaxin.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/mcaloo-tikki.jpg\" title=\"\">McAloo Tikki burger</a> is not a patch on the infinitely more delicious crispy alu tikkis with tamarind chutney found at any street vendor. Their <a href=\"http://thechatterjis.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/paneer-burger2.png\" title=\"\">McSpicy Paneer</a> is a cop-out, falling back on that bland veggie standby: paneer. It's the insipid nut roast of India, the tofu of timidity.</p> <p>Cleanliness, you say? Nope. Even if you are a foreigner with a stomach like tissue paper, you are better off eating piping hot, fresh dosas from a busy street vendor than you are eating stale fast food. India has always had homegrown chains of veggie fast food joints which are every bit as clean and quality conscious as McDonald's, perhaps even more so. And I'd rather give my money to a small business owner than a McCorporation.</p> <p>But hey, I am not going to sermonise. Or even tell you, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Size_Me\" title=\"\">Morgan Spurlock</a>-style, that veggie burgers are killing you slowly. I don't need to. After almost 16 years in India, McDonald's has just over 250 outlets here, which, in such a massive country, is pocket change. I suspect that Indians are smart enough to know which side of their pav bhaji is buttered. Sure, broke students and tubby kids hankering after plastic toys will continue to eat there, but there will also be plenty like me who shun the Golden Arches in favour of a truly happy and tasty meal.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Kavitha Rao is a Bangalore-based journalist</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/andrew-tobert\" title=\"\"><strong>Andrew Tobert</strong></a><strong>: I'm lovin' it</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395739861\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/6/1346927091929/tobert.jpg\" alt=\"tobert\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>There are few more powerful symbols than the Golden Arches. For me, they represent at once the homogenising influence of market forces, the evil of industrialised agriculture, the obesity crisis. And the last time I was truly happy.</p> <p>McDonald's, from the first time I crossed its air-conditioned threshold, has offered a place of sanctuary and calm. The smell of whatever-that-smell-is wafting through the air and the happy children, joyous with additives swirling around their blood streams. This is where I've had my best thoughts, my most cherished memories. This is where I can truly be me.</p> <p>And I'm not alone. From Shanghai to Chicago, kids, pensioners, lawyers and students come and are welcome. However much people might not want this to be true, McDonald's is the global restaurant \u2013 the place that unites humanity. You might find better, cheaper food elsewhere, but that's not going to convince Parisian school kids or London lawyers coming back for more.</p> <p>I used to go three times a week (and yes, dear readers, I was a fat child). I wasn't just lovin' it, I was stalking it on Facebook, and naming our soon-to-be-children. But three months ago, my life changed for ever. I became vegetarian (something about climate change and global hunger, but I forget the details). My place of solace was now closed off.</p> <p>Of course when I walk by a restaurant, it looks as it always has. As I stand on the street corner, I see people laughing, enjoying themselves. I want to go in, and share the things that make us human. But I know I can't, the temptations will be too much. The Chicken Selects, the Big Mac, the fries (I could go on), so delicious and so stunningly cheap. I miss them. A lot. But I made my choice, and I must accept the consequences. So there's me, outside. An outcast in a meat-eating world. But perhaps not for much longer.</p> <p>That's why a McDonald's veggie restaurant in India fills me with unadulterated joy and hope. Yes, there are <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=haterz\" title=\"\">haterz</a>, there always are. And to them I say, whatevs. Indians won't all become obese overnight, and their cuisine isn't going to suddenly disappear. Maybe Indian vegetarians, like their meat-eating peers the world over, watch McDonald's ads and think \"you know what, that looks cool\". And isn't that a wonderful thing? That we live in a world where people can pick and choose the best of global culture, regardless of where they were born? McDonald's is the global emancipator. May its benevolence spread far and wide.</p> <p>But first, could the veggie outlets spread to London? Say, Hackney, E9. Then I won't feel a stab of jealousy every time I pass a branch. And maybe then I can stop resenting being a vegetarian, and start actually enjoying it. Yes, those really will be the (Mc)Salad days.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Andrew Tobert is a copywriter, an environmental activist and a lousy vegetarian</em></p>",
  "<p>The House of Commons will today <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmfbusi/a01.htm\" title=\"\">debate the motion</a> that the government should take \"all necessary steps\" to stabilise the UK's population \"as close as possible to its present level\". What the motion's authors really want, of course, is for the government to cut net immigration to zero. But in choosing to frame the debate around population growth, they have created a useful opportunity. The old line that \"we aren't allowed to talk about immigration\" is clearly no longer true, if it ever was, but population issues are genuinely neglected, in public debate and inside the policymaking community.</p> <p>As the <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/index.html\" title=\"\">2011 Census</a> showed, there are three main drivers of our growing population: increasing longevity, increasing fertility, and positive net immigration. The second of these, fertility, is partly related to the third: migrants are more likely to be of child-bearing age, and foreign-born mothers have more children than those UK-born. But contrary to some of the fears of anti-immigration campaigners, the fertility gap is not widening but closing: the most recent figures show foreign-born mothers having fewer babies than they were, while the fertility rate of UK-born mothers continues to rise.</p> <p>Even those who are worried by population growth would accept that slowing down improvements in healthcare (to reduce longevity) or in childcare (to reduce fertility) would be cutting off our nose to spite our face. All the more important, many will say, to focus on the third driver, immigration. But here too, the changes that would be necessary to cut net immigration to the level the motion calls for \u2013 and logically that means cutting it to less than zero, if fertility and longevity are to continue increasing \u2013 would have costs which many would regard as unacceptable if they thought about them seriously. Cutting net immigration to this extent would mean going far beyond immigration policy as it is generally understood: it would mean leaving the European Union, and telling British citizens they can no longer marry who they like, as well as closing our universities to foreign students. It might even require us, perversely, to dampen economic growth (despite our current troubles, increasing numbers are coming here from Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy), and pull back from Britain's traditional global role in culture and trade.</p> <p>A more productive debate would focus not on overall numbers, but on how we best respond to a growing population, whatever its causes. The ageing society is notorious for being an issue that politicians of all parties have been slow to grasp. Rising fertility ought to be easier to deal with, but both the previous government and the coalition have fallen short, both in maternity services and primary school places. We also need to ensure that the funding mechanisms, which match public money with local population changes, respond far more quickly than they did over the last decade. And of course we need to deal with the growing shortage of housing.</p> <p>These are very serious challenges; it is understandable if people think that until we come up with some solutions, we should not be making them worse. But it would be a shame if we slipped into the mindset of seeing a growing population as essentially a drain on resources. Even in the case of longevity this is a mean-spirited and indeed narrow-minded way of thinking about the issue. In the case of fertility and immigration, it is simply incorrect to see extra people purely as a burden, and not as current or future workers who will pay the taxes to fund public services and help reduce the deficit and public debt.</p> <p>Some will argue that even if a growing population is a good thing in the abstract \u2013 or in big countries like America or Australia or Canada \u2013 Britain (or at least England) is a small country that is simply \"full up\". It is true that we are relatively densely populated; but it is also true that even if the UK population did reach 70 million, if it lived as densely as Londoners, it would occupy an area of just under 6,000km<sup>2</sup> : less than 5% of England. At any conceivable level off population, it is how this population is distributed which matters far more than the overall number. Even in housing, where the challenge seems the most intractable, building enough to accommodate 70 million, far from concreting over the whole of England, would increase the developed area from 10% to 12%.</p> <p>The same kind of answer applies to those who worry about population growth at a global level. Are we not adding irresponsibly to problems of climate change, or resource scarcity, which already look insurmountable? The answer, again, is that these problems are driven not just by overall numbers but by changes in the distribution of population \u2013 in particular, by increasing urbanisation \u2013 and by changes in patterns of consumption; and that the kind of breakthroughs we need to make, in achieving more efficient, responsible, and fair use of resources, would \u2013 if we succeed in making them \u2013 easily swallow up current levels of population growth across the developed world.</p>",

  "<p>A distant waterbird flaps lazily along a strip of verdant marshy shoreline, the brown river drifting sluggishly alongside, while a young soldier stands looking on bored with his rifle. There are no sounds but the water lapping and a soft drone of insects \u2013 only the barbed-wire fence and the military presence give a clue that this tranquil scene is the centre of one the world's most dangerous nuclear stand-offs.</p> <p>The no man's land between North and South Korea, surrounded on all sides by heavily armed watchtowers, has been in place since the Korean war ended in 1953. A narrow strip of land along the line that divides the country in two has been deliberately depopulated, to create a buffer zone between the two states.</p> <p>Inadvertently, this clearing has also created a haven for wildlife, including at least 67 of the world's most endangered species of birds, mammals, reptiles and insects. When the people moved out, animals and plants moved back in to recolonise what over six decades has become a small paradise.</p> <p>But this peaceful scene of a gradual return to nature is under threat, and with it some of the last shreds of the original biodiversity of this unique peninsula. Development is encroaching even here, with resurgent agricultural development destroying swaths of the restored habitat and clearing away regrown plant life. On the eve of the world's biggest conservation conference, which opens on the Korean island of Jeju on Thursday, scientists and experts on the area are pleading with the southern government to offer the region internationally protected status.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395924017\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/06/06/DMZ24.jpg\" alt=\"Train tracks pass near North Korea's demilitarized zone (DMZ) \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Train tracks pass near North Korea's demilitarized zone (DMZ). Photograph: Getty</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>SeungHo Kim, director of the DMZ Ecology Research Institute, said the question was becoming urgent: \"Unfortunately there are a lot of development projects around the demilitarised zone (DMZ). It is endangered.\" ChiYong An, his colleague, added: \"Policymakers are not aware of the speed of destruction of the DMZ.\"</p> <p>The effects are already being felt. On one island in the area, there used to be a population of 300 swan goose \u2013 now there are fewer than 60, An said.</p> <p>Hong Koo Lee, former prime minister of South Korea, chairs the organising committee for the 10,000-participant <a href=\"http://www.iucnworldconservationcongress.org/\" title=\"\">World Conservation Congress</a>, the four-yearly meeting of the IUCN, hosted here as part of the government's programme for green economic growth. He said the future of the DMZ was a major concern for the Korean government: \"We have most successfully conserved the land in the DMZ \u2013 I don't find anywhere else like this in the world. We want to preserve it.\" However, key issues remain to be addressed \u2013 not least what will happen to the outskirts of the zone, where biodiversity is coming under increasing threat from encroachment.</p> <p>Only 4km wide, the core of the DMZ extends all the way across Korea \u2013 a distance of 248 km. The only people allowed to walk this mine-strewn wilderness are a small number of patrolling soldiers marked out in special gear that shows they are not planning aggression.</p> <p>Beyond the 2km line on each side, bordered by barbed wire fences, there is a further zone varying from about 7km to more than 15km in width, either side of the border, known as the civilian restricted zone. While outside the demilitarised zone proper, this is far from a normal space \u2013 there are strict controls on who can enter and for what purpose.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395924018\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2012/4/13/1334314428492/Wildlife-in-Korean-Demili-007.jpg\" alt=\"Wildlife in Korean Demilitarized Zone , DMZ : Manchurian cranes\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manchurian cranes with their distinctive black and white feathers fly low over fields in Chulwon valley, just south of the Korean Demilitarized Zone. Photograph: AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the creatures that thrive here, this much bigger controlled area is just as important as the depopulated DMZ in terms of providing habitat. As a long strip across Korea, the zone encompasses a rich variety of landscapes \u2013 from coastal and river areas, surrounded by wetlands, to high wooded mountains and lush slopes inland. The cranes \u2013 including the <a href=\"http://www.arkive.org/white-naped-crane/grus-vipio/\" title=\"\">white-naped</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.arkive.org/japanese-crane/grus-japonensis/\" title=\"\">Manchurian crane</a>, listed as vulnerable and endangered respectively by IUCN \u2013 are among a host of migratory birds that come to winter, while permanent residents include the leopard cat, several types of deer, and in the mountains black bears and the rare amur goral, an ungulate. Snakes and reptiles, some of them very rare, also abound, and amphibians including the endangered Korean golden frog. Unfortunately, by the time the DMZ was set up, it was already too late to save Korea's tiger population, wiped out before the war.</p> <p>After the 1953 armistice, the security situation remained highly volatile, and people were strongly dissuaded from entering the restricted zone surrounding the DMZ proper. In the 1970s, the discovery of tunnels from North Korea, preparations for a possible invasion, heightened the sense of threat and the controls were strictly kept. Only a few people were allowed in from South Korea, with special licences from the government, and often they had to obey a curfew and return every sunset.</p> <p>It took two more decades for the threat to recede, but since 2000 there has been a noticeable thawing of relations. There are now even a handful of commuter buses that run North and South, to and from factories set up by southern companies in the north, where labour is cheaper. Though welcome to the stressed populations of both countries, this has spelt major change for the controlled zone. As the border has become safer, people \u2013 often the original landowners who were removed after the war \u2013 have returned in greater numbers, with more permits being granted by the government and fewer restrictions on where and what they can do.</p> <p>The results are obvious, as rice fields and plantations of ginseng crowd the wetlands bordering the DMZ. Many of these fields are not new \u2013 some date back centuries \u2013 but have been reclaimed for intense production.</p> <p>SeoungHo Kim, director of the South Korean government-funded DMZ Ecology Research Institute, points to some fields punctuated by large spits of woodland. \"All of that is owned by the same person, who would like to develop the woodland too, but there are mines in it,\" he says.</p> <p>An over-zealous reclamation of the land risks returning the restricted zone to the same intensive agriculture that characterises the rest of the region, which is not conducive to biodiversity, and would also leave the tiny strip of the DMZ exposed and vulnerable. Some of the new fields are surrounded with electric fences.</p> <p>For South Korea, this is a dilemma. An ancient country that has been invaded scores of times by its neighbours \u2013 China, Mongolia, Russia have all tried to seize power, and most recently Japan occupied the country from 1910 to 1945 \u2013 food security is an essential part of its national spirit. South Korea is 100% self-sufficient in rice, our guide proudly announces \u2013 adding that the only imports are for use as animal feed. As a mountainous country, with only 20% of the land area suitable for arable farming, that means putting the land under serious pressure, obvious in the countryside near Seoul, where densely packed paddyfields are bordered by bean plants and maize, so as not to waste an inch, and even roadside verges are planted with squashes and chillies.</p> <p>A further concern is that if the country is reunified \u2013 and South Korea's Unification Bridge, Village and Observatory, as well as the Peace Bell bell rung hourly at the last stop before the North, attest to its hope of doing just that \u2013 then this zone will be up for grabs. Hence the movement now building, both within Korea and among international NGOs and scientists, to have the DMZ declared an internationally protected site.</p> <p>One key opportunity was to have this week's congress pass a resolution on protected status. Those hopes have been dashed, however. Lee, chairman of the organising committee, said: \"We asked for discussions on this matter at Congress, but we are very careful because this is a question between North and South Korea [which are jointly responsible for the DMZ]. We hoped the North Korean delegation would attend but for whatever reason, they could not.\"</p> <p>That means there can be no resolution of the issue at the conference, and there is no discussion of the issue between the two states yet in sight. While governments stall, the prospects for the last great hope for Korea's ancestral biodiversity are being steadily eroded.</p>",
  "<p>Benita Veliz, a young Hispanic \"Dreamer\" from San Antonio in Texas, struck a blow for immigrant rights when she became the first undocumented person to address a national political convention.</p> <p>Veliz \u2013 Benny to friends \u2013 openly and unashamedly proclaimed her unauthorised status in front of millions of American TV viewers. She told them she was brought to the US from Mexico as a child and has lived here ever since.</p> <p>She graduated at the top of her class aged 16 and went on to earn a double major four years later. \"I know I have something to contribute to the economy and my country, and I feel just as American as any of my friends or neighbours.\"</p> <p>In 2009 Veliz came close to being deported back to Mexico after she came into the Texas authorities' purview for a minor traffic violation. \"I've had to live almost my entire life knowing I could be deported because of the way I came here,\" she told the convention.</p> <p>Veliz is one of thousands of Hispanics aged 15 to 30 who will be able to take advantage of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/15/obama-stop-deportation-undocumented-immigrants\">executive order declared by President Obama in June</a>. The deferred action order, dubbed \"dream relief\", will allow young undocumented immigrants to put off the threat of deportation for two years to allow them to pursue studies and work opportunities.</p> <p>\"President Obama fought for the Dream Act to help people like me,\" said Velix, who is now studying at St Mary's university in San Antonio. \"When Congress refused to support it, he didn't give up.\"</p> <p>Veliz's audacious appearance in front of millions of Americans is the most high-profile example yet of a growing determination on the part of young undocumented Hispanics to come out of the shadows and announce themselves as a proud part of the American family. Some 11 million people are living in America without permission, about 60% of whom are of Mexican origin.</p> <p>Her address is the second time in two days that the Texan city of San Antonio, the seventh most populous city in the US, was put on the map at the convention. On Tuesday the city's mayor, Julian Castro, delivered the keynote speech.</p> <p>The euphoria among immigrant groups surrounding Veliz's address was dampened a little by news out of Arizona that broke just a couple of hours earlier. A federal judge gave the green light to the most controversial part of the notorious SB 1070 law \u2013 the clause dubbed the \"show me your papers\" provision \u2013 that instructs police to investigate the immigration status of anyone they deem suspicious of being undocumented who they come across in the course of other policing matters.</p> <p>SB 1070 was signed into law in 2010 but quickly put on ice following legal challenges that pushed the law up to the US supreme court. It unleashed a storm of hostile measures directed against undocumented immigrants that swept across Southern legislatures.</p> <p>Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, South Carolina and Utah all scrambled to follow Arizona's example. In turn, those anti-illegal immigration laws provided the inspiration for Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential challenger, who advocated the \"self-deportation\" of millions of people.</p> <p>It is not known precisely when the \"show me your papers\" law will now come into effect in Arizona, but it is expected to be within the next two weeks. When SB 1070 was first introduced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/18/hispanics-flee-arizona-immigration-law\">it led to virtual panic </a>among unauthorised Hispanic families, with thousands fleeing the state.</p>"
