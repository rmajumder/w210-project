  "<p>\"Smile or grim?\" asks Sam Allardyce as he poses for a photograph next to the West Ham dugout. The words are fitting for a manager who has been around for 20 years and seen it all, a man who has survived heart scares, sackings and allegations of bungs, a football figure portrayed as both forward thinking and regressive \u2013 hailed for introducing everything from Tai Chi to equine ice therapy at Bolton, while simultaneously pilloried for playing the most route one football around. And winning.</p> <p>Now here he is at West Ham, the Academy of Football. The irony is not lost on him. At his first press conference for the club, he says, it took around 24 seconds before someone asked how the \"long ball\" game would go down with the Boleyn Ground faithful. Big Sam, the caricature, may grin but Allardyce, the man, is more sensitive. As he talks about his life he raises many sore points \u2013 how it feels to be made redundant, the vulnerability of a football manager, the depression of sitting around at home being unemployed, the transient world of football where the media love you one day and cane you the next, where you never know who you can trust.</p> <p>Although he would not describe it that way, Allardyce's reign at West Ham has been portrayed as unpopular with some fans. Despite having won promotion back to the Premier League in his first season in charge, there have been persistent boos from sections of the crowd. Just last week in the League Cup his team were jeered after a 4-1 defeat to Wigan. What does he make of it?</p> <p>\"Well I don't think the fans did give me a hard time [over the year], apart from certain pockets of fans on certain occasions,\" he says, shifting in his seat. \"Occasionally there were fans who were upset and disgruntled but a lot less than Avram [Grant]. Avram got far more stick than I did. And Alan Curbishley got a lot of stick when he was here, and he was one of their own. I get no more stick than Gianfranco Zola, and Avram Grant, Harry Redknapp. I know because I spoke to all them. I didn't speak to Avram actually, because I couldn't get hold of him, but, yeah, if you don't do it right here you get stick, I accept that. But you get stick everywhere. That's the nature of the industry now \u2026 Contrary to what any media say, fans at West Ham are interested in the passion of the player and the commitment of the player, rather than all that pretty football stuff.\"</p> <p>Historically, of course, Upton Park has prized \"pretty\" football. Allardyce, though, says history is overrated. Walking through the tunnel he points to a spot of redecorating. \"Do you like the new wallpaper?\" he asks. \"I chose it myself.\" Where once the walls were covered in old photographs of West Ham greats, intended to inspire the players as they wait to file out on to the pitch, now there are pictures of West Ham's Championship play-off final victory in May. Some clubs, he says, get too \"bogged down\" in history. He makes a disapproving face. How many of today's West Ham fans actually watched Trevor Brooking or Bobby Moore play, he wonders. \"It's the modern day history that's important, I like to think.\" As he emerges from the tunnel, flanked by the stands dedicated to Brooking and Moore, his words jar with his surroundings.</p> <p>Whatever the supporters think, as a personality the 57-year-old Allardyce is a popular figure. Those around the club say he is well liked, and it is impossible not to warm to him as he describes life with Mrs Allardyce in the jet-set surroundings of their rented Canary Wharf apartment. \"We've never lived in a city before,\" he says, making it sound like some charming middle-aged adventure. Certainly half an hour in his company is entertaining as he reminisces about his playing days, eating fillet steak and toast for a pre-match meal \u2013 \"running around with a lump of meat in your stomach during the match\" \u2013 in the bad old days when it was believed that drinking water during a training session would bring on cramp. Back then all drinks, other than tea, were strictly banned. \"It's a wonder some of us didn't die,\" says Allardyce.</p> <p>As he talks about the science of rehydration or the role of sports psychology in the game, you cannot help but try to imagine the young Allardyce as he embarked on his first managerial appointment at Limerick more than two decades ago. He leans back in his chair and smiles, pityingly, at his old self. \"You have all these ideas in your head, all these super plans of what you're going to do and how you're going to take the managing world by storm.\" He gazes out over the pitch. \"You take as much advice as you can, particularly off the older, more experienced managers and they all tell you. You sit in that job and you have all these ideas and you speak to Jim Smith or Harry Bassett or Howard Wilkinson or Alex Ferguson and they say: 'Well, son, your job is to survive.' You say: 'What do you mean?' They say: 'Well, you've got to survive in that job. If you don't you might never get another one.'</p> <p>\"It shocks you, obviously. You want to do all this and that but the reality is start winning football matches and you start getting credibility as a manager. The LMA [League Managers Association] brought some stats out, they said if you lose your first job, 80% of the time you never get another one.\"</p> <p>Being sacked by Newcastle and then Blackburn hit Allardyce hard, he says. The dismissals knocked his confidence as he sat around at home for a torrid 11 months waiting \u2013 hoping \u2013 for another job offer. \"We all sit and wait and hope,\" he says. \"Cynically we have to wait until someone else loses a job before you can get back in the game.\"</p> <p>When the call came from West Ham, did he think: thank God? \"Yeah, I did,\" he says. \"If I didn't get another job in the game after what happened at Blackburn I wouldn't have been satisfied. You know people would have said, 'What's happened to Sam Allardyce? Oh well, since he got sacked at Blackburn he hasn't done anything.' I thought I can't let it finish there, I've got to wait for the right opportunity again. You always have to continue to prove yourself as a manager. Wherever you go, no matter how good it was wherever it was you were at before, it's always the next job. You get into this famous, fabulous football club and you have to reinvent it by using your skills and ability.\"</p> <p>Two weeks into the role, however, and Allardyce wondered what he had gotten into. \"I thought, have I done the right thing? It was not very nice, you know. Trudging through all this negativity. Not just from outside but from within the club. All this doom and gloom. Job losses \u2026 Every day there were problems.\"</p> <p>Allardyce describes the process of mopping up a relegation mess: being faced with an exodus of players all desperate to leave \u2013 the club lost 40 players in 12 months \u2013 battling the endemic \"feeling sorry for yourself\" culture, losing club staff who had been there for donkey's years, and the do-or-die importance of bringing in \"people you can trust\". The latter is interesting particularly in light of what happened at Blackburn with Allardyce's former assistant, Steve Kean. \"You have to have someone you can trust when you join a new football club,\" he says, \"because football is the enigma of gossip. It goes around everywhere. You've got to find out about people and you don't know whether you can trust them or not.\"</p> <p>Key to building that circle of trust has been bringing an influential player into the dressing room in the former Bolton and Newcastle midfielder, Kevin Nolan, as captain. \"Kevin. He changed the dressing room. He can galvanise a group of players, which is a massive responsibility taken away from me because you don't know what's going on in the dressing room, you've got no idea. Not that he comes telling tales to me, but you know he's going to promote the fact that he's not come down here to mess about: 'I ain't left Newcastle United to come down here and mess about at West Ham. I've come down here to get back up'.\"</p> <p>The attitude suits Allardyce. The Dudley-born former defender also wants to be businesslike, shake off the interminable \"long ball\" jibes, and just get on with the job of managing West Ham. This season that job involves staying up, and the immediate aim of securing points against Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road on Monday night, but beyond that he is hoping for an extension to his two-year contract, a reason to make the London life his own. \"I'd love to see the fans into the Olympic Stadium,\" he says of the proposed 2014 move, \"and I'd like to walk them out there.\"</p> <p><em>Sam Allardyce was speaking on behalf of Barclays Ticket Office.

  "<p>A dot of light expands to devour the darkness; the waters of the Rhine surge and heave; primal rumblings rise up from the pit, itself in blackout as the music starts. Covent Garden\u2019s Ring Cycle, in the first opera, <strong><a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/productions/das-rheingold-by-keith-warner\" title=\"\">Das Rheingold</a></strong>, begins with the Big Bang. Or at least, a Biggish Bang, the birth of a parallel universe which will end in black catastrophe before, in the radiant final bars of <em>G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung</em> many hours and several days later, Wagner hints at redemption and new life.</p> <p>Between this alpha and omega, a Wagnerian roll call of synchronised aquamaidens, asbo gods, knitting sybils, dwarves, giants and female stormtroopers together weave the complex tapestry of lust, ambition, grief and greed which is Wagner\u2019s four-part pagan masterpiece. This sold-out ROH revival has a top cast led by two British stars of world-class standing, Bryn Terfel and Susan Bullock. In Marie-Jeanne Lecca\u2019s costumes these everyday mythical folk are kitted out in an eclectic array of patterned velvets and workaday hemp \u2013 in time (roughly 19th century) and, in the case of the hirsute, shrieking, skull-clutching Valkyries (excellent they were too), timeless.</p> <p>The Royal Opera House has taken the risk of performing four complete cycles, a daunting test of stamina, instead of the usual three preceded by a paid dress rehearsal, a chance to establish confidence in front of an audience. Given the expense of staging the Ring, and the fact that all the cycles (top price \u00a31,000) immediately sold out, you can understand the ROH\u2019s thinking, though with hindsight they may have been impetuous.</p> <p>Both <em>Rheingold </em>and <em>Die Walk\u00fcre</em>, the first two operas, had incandescent moments but still felt provisional, with more than a few clumsy manoeuvres and minor hitches. Lucky those who will see subsequent cycles, which will surely grow with each enactment. There were lapses between stage and pit in <em>Rheingold </em>on Monday, but generally the sense of caution had vanished by<a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/productions/die-walkure-by-keith-warner\" title=\"\"> </a><strong><a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/productions/die-walkure-by-keith-warner\" title=\"\">Die Walk\u00fcre</a></strong> on Wednesday. Singers had warmed up; the orchestral sound begun to glow and coalesce.</p> <p>The Royal Opera\u2019s music director Antonio Pappano, steeped in this music, is a judicious, generous Wagnerian, with a passionate comprehension of score and text. The sight of six harpists undulating in their side-box above the pit offers its own theatre. The horns barked hideously to warn of Hunding\u2019s hounds. Cellos and low woodwind made rapturous love music for the Wolsung twins Siegmund (Simon O\u2019Neill) and Sieglinde (Eva-Maria Westbroek). If theirs was not the most tempestuous of incestuous encounters, it had its own urgent compulsion.</p> <p>There was a new intimacy in the key exchanges, particularly between Wotan (Bryn Terfel) and his wife Fricka (a cool, severe and wonderful Sarah Connolly), and between Wotan and his favourite daughter, the \u201cexpression of his will\u201d, Br\u00fcnnhilde. Susan Bullock, in her first complete cycle for the ROH and not a minute too soon, has extraordinary power, her voice ringing out from upstage even when her back is turned to us. She radiates tender emotion in every gesture, essential but by no means a given for this archetypal Wagner heroine. As Wotan, Terfel, now fully inside the role, has towering stage presence, intelligence, anguish, a sense of this god\u2019s bloody-mindedness and fallibility. His \u201cFarewell\u201d to Br\u00fcnnhilde stirred immense pathos.</p> <p>Directors have always struggled to say something new about Wagner\u2019s music-drama. Marxism, capitalism, industrialisation, ecology: there\u2019s space for any hobbyhorse. For the Royal Opera, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/26/keith-warner-wagner-ring-cycle-royal-opera-house?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Keith Warner</a> has taken on the current enigmas of cosmology and biochemistry. Wagner knew nothing of the search for dark matter and eerie bosons when he wrote <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Ring_des_Nibelungen\" title=\"\">Der Ring des Nibelungen</a></em>. Neither, at a guess, did most of the audience when Warner\u2019s staging for the Royal Opera House was new, entering the repertoire in instalments from 2004 before a complete cycle in 2007.</p> <p>We may not, then, have spotted immediately all the double helix imagery in the late <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/may/16/stefanos-lazaridis-obituary\" title=\"\">Stefanos Lazaridis</a>\u2018s designs. Now it has become common visual vocabulary. An arc of metal, a spinning propeller, balls of coiled barbed wire? No, don\u2019t tell me. Just DNA doing its thing again. When Sieglinde and Siegmund recognise, with hopeless horror, that they are brother and sister, husband and wife, the huge splayed spiral of metal which dominates the stage turns ice blue as if to say, it\u2019s all in the genes.</p> <p>There are other preoccupations, perhaps too many: the philosopher <a href=\"http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ludwig_Andreas_Feuerbach\" title=\"\">Feuerbach</a>\u2018s influence on Wagner, a reference to Hitler\u2019s Berchtesgaden eyrie in Wotan\u2019s salon, a red rope whose appearance is frequent but whose purpose, if I ever knew, I have forgotten again. Assisted by four associate producers, Warner has streamlined this revival: fewer bodies on slabs in Nibelheim, less furniture, more children; Erda comes up through a hole in the earth instead of sitting in an armchair. Wotan plunges down the same orifice in search of her at the end of <em>Rheingold</em>, implicitly breaking his marriage vows while Fricka climbs the wobbly Rainbow Bridge.</p> <p>The unquenchable John Tomlinson, who stood in<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/sep/10/classicalmusicandopera1\" title=\"\"> at the last minute</a> as Wotan in 2007, is back as a menacing Hunding, bristling with violence, a thug who takes his axe to bed with him. His wise and benign presence, even playing a villain \u2013 hard for those of us who only see him as one of the opera world\u2019s great heroes \u2013 gives added authority to all.</p> <p>Next up: <em><a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/productions/siegfried-by-keith-warner\" title=\"\">Siegfried</a> </em>and <em><a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/productions/gotterdammerung-by-keith-warner\" title=\"\">G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung</a></em>.

  "<p>This week we'll find out if Tesco boss Philip Clarke's \u00a31bn trolley dash is adding up at the till. In April, that was the huge estimated cost of turning around the supermarket's ailing UK stores after everything fell apart during the crucial Christmas trading period.</p> <p>After years of denying that its home market chain had a problem, the company issued a shock profit warning in January and since then has been washing its dirty laundry in public. This week promises to be another bruising one, even for Tesco's notoriously thick-skinned executives, as Clarke presides over the first drop in half-year profits since 1993.</p> <p>After earning a reputation for being one of the most consistent performers in corporate Britain, Tesco is expected to announce a 10% fall in group profits to \u00a31.6bn (in the UK they are forecast to be down around 13% at \u00a31.1bn). That will be hard to digest at head office in Cheshunt.</p> <p>Shareholders will have steeled themselves for the bad news and are now likely to more interested in whether the turnaround plan announced by Clarke in April is working. The money is being spent on sprucing up stores, hiring extra store staff and a long-overdue revamp of its own-label foodstuffs. The plan is not rocket science \u2013 in fact, it reads like basic good housekeeping for a retailer the management textbooks have led us to believe is among the best in class.</p> <p>How the UK stores ended up in such a sorry state remains a moot point and Clarke avoids assigning blame. The less diplomatic would point to the reign of his lauded predecessor, Sir Terry Leahy, who used profits generated at home to plant flags abroad but starved the home market chain of investment.</p> <p>But they are where they are, and last week's Tesco senior executives appeared confident as they led a guided tour of one of their new-look \"Extra\" stores in Hertfordshire. It is hard not to be impressed by the zeal of the team, known as the \"Baldock Group\" after the Hertfordshire store where early crisis meetings were held. They trumpeted new attractions such as artisan-style bakeries, hundreds of \"new, improved\" products and quirks such as sports nutrition departments, which loyalty card data tells them is a growing market after the Olympics.</p> <p>There was talk of \"green shoots of progress\", a sentiment backed up by recent data that suggests Tesco's market share has at least stabilised. On Wednesday it is thought that Clarke will report flat underlying sales \u2013 a key measure of performance \u2013 ending six quarters of decline in the UK.</p> <p>Britain is not Tesco's only problem. Clarke is still grappling with the loss-making US chain Fresh &amp; Easy and a setback in South Korea, Tesco's biggest overseas market, where legislation allowing local governments to impose shorter trading hours is hitting sales. But there is also a larger dimension to the depressed Tesco share price. After years of celebrating it for its reliable returns, investors have lost their appetite for the grocery sector as a whole, reappraising it in a new world of turgid sales where shoppers are increasingly turning to the internet to make purchases.</p> <p>Panmure Gordon analyst Philip Dorgan goes as far as to describe the supermarket sector as \"uninvestable\" in its current form, relying as it does on expensive new store openings to grab increments of market share. He has calculated that, over the last decade, Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons have splurged \u00a334bn to increase operating profits by a measly \u00a31.7bn. And with the internet sucking all the growth out of a depressed retail sector, the rush to devote new space to clothing and homewares looks foolhardy.</p> <p>Clarke has already called a halt to the space race, slamming the brakes on UK expansion to focus on the internet and existing stores. It's time other supermarket chiefs followed suit and did a better job of running the stores they've already got.</p> <h2>A platform for renationalisation</h2> <p>While a judge somewhere slowly ponders the merits of Sir Richard Branson's latest legal challenge, passengers wanting to travel between Britain's biggest cities might well be wondering just who is going to be running their trains in 10 weeks' time.</p> <p>The west coast main line franchising decision is slowly turning from controversy via farce into a question far more fundamental than which firm's livery is painted on the carriages. FirstGroup, who \u2013 lest we forget \u2013 offered to pay a billion more to the taxpayer than Virgin to run the line, still claims to be confident of organising the transfer of 3,500 staff, thousands of contracts and several dozen rebranded Pendolinos.</p> <p>But as the December deadline approaches, the government has clearly thought it prudent to get its own people ready to take over the trains instead. Many believe that Directly Operated Railways, the state company currently operating on the east coast main line after the last franchising fiasco, will have to step in for a while, at least when Virgin's time is up.</p> <p>And during this hiatus, some interesting facts have emerged. The transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, said that though the cost of keeping FirstGroup in the waiting room could run into millions, revenues would far exceed it. While First thought it could stump up \u00a310bn over the term of the franchise and still coin it in, Virgin was targeting a 7% profit margin.</p> <p>Meanwhile, on the state-run east coast service, punctuality is at its highest since 1999, passengers numbers and satisfaction figures are up, and the company has returned the best part of \u00a3200m in profits to the taxpayer.</p> <p>The shadow transport secretary, Maria Eagle, has stopped short of calling for a renationalisation of the railways, although she has signalled that the debate is on. With the prospect of the two main rail arteries being in state hands by Christmas, there may be a few more voices at Labour party conference wondering if it's time to cut out the millionaire middlemen.</p> <h2>Bankers and jail</h2> <p>There is always a clamour for heads to roll when mistakes are made. No more so than during the continuing banking crisis. Many of the big names at the top of the larger banks have moved on.</p> <p>But this has not answered the lingering question of why no one has been jailed for their part in the financial crisis. Martin Wheatley, the Financial Services Authority executive, summed up the mood when he called for powers to jail those found to have rigged Libor in the interest rate manipulation scandal that gripped the markets during the summer. \"Society wants the people who commit these sorts of crimes to pay the price and if that includes jail for the most extreme fraud in the system, then that's what should happen,\" he said.</p> <p>The threat of jail is a serious deterrent, and Wheatley is right to hold it over future miscreants. But a society unable to move on from the financial crisis until a banker is behind bars is not a pretty spectacle.</p>",

  "<p>Late afternoon in Florence and suddenly the sky veers from luminous blue to blushing orange. The light on the Duomo changes in an instant. Brunelleschi's iconic dome burns a&#xa0;deep terracotta. The white, green and pink marble of Giotto's bell tower is incandescent. An Italian sign on the steps of the cathedral says, rather dryly, that \"this is a work of art and everyone has the right to admire it\". Not to stand and stare would be rude.</p> <p>I have visited Florence on more than a dozen occasions. This time I am determined to spend a long weekend seeing art for free in churches that don't charge an entry fee. So I find myself standing outside the Duomo, remembering that for centuries people have talked about it being turned inside out, with the exterior a bold statement of Florentine power and the interior spare and minimal. Turn around and in front of you is a copy of Ghiberti's gilded bronze <em>Gates of Paradise</em> on the baptistery doors. The originals are in the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo, but why pay when you can enjoy Renaissance art as it's supposed to be seen, outside or inside the buildings that actually commissioned it \u2013 thus allowing it a context denied by galleries?</p> <p>Intoxicated by the city once more, I plot a vaguely circular church crawl around its centre from our modern, affordable apartment overlooking the Piazza della Signoria. Peering from the terrace, I can't quite see the copy of Michelangelo's statue of David, but I can see Neptune standing proud and I can certainly hear the bells of the crenellated tower of the Palazzo Vecchio ringing out through the night.</p> <p>The apartment is adjacent to the Uffizi (not going \u2013 it costs), whose snaking queue I wander past on my way to San Miniato al Monte. I avoid the Ponte Vecchio, which is packed with dawdling tourists, yet the Ponte alle Grazie, just to the east, is full of Fiorentini going about their daily business. Away from the crowds \u2013 and it really is possible to find yourself alone in the narrow, shaded streets \u2013 you have the space to feel the ghosts of the city's 15th-century artists and of a murdered Medici or two.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396836289\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/9/26/1348673631222/Santo-Spirito-church.-001.jpg\" alt=\"Santo Spirito church.\" width=\"460\" height=\"493\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Santo Spirito church. Photograph: Alamy</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Up on the hill, overlooking the city from south of the River Arno, San Miniato is one of the few churches to have survived virtually intact. During the siege of Florence in 1530, Michelangelo had the bright idea of protecting its defensive walls by wrapping them in mattresses to absorb the shock of cannonballs. Today, in the sweltering heat of early September, its fa\u00e7ade is a glossy vision of green and white marble, its interior a stunning collection of frescoes by Taddeo Gaddi and a crucifix attributed to Luca della Robbia. In the apse is a perfectly restored 13th-century mosaic of Christ, by an unknown artist, and to his right, San Miniato. The martyred saint is said to have picked up his decapitated head, trudged across the&#xa0;river and walked up to this spot. I&#xa0;can see why he made the effort \u2013 the views of the city shimmering in the heat are gorgeous.</p> <p>It's only a short walk, past the Piazzale Michelangelo with its bronze copy of David, to Santa Felicita (Piazza di Santa Felicita, 3). An unpretentious church, it's thought to be the second oldest in the city after San Lorenzo. Here, where the smooth marble floors are being mopped by an old lady, are paintings by the Mannerist painter and portraitist Pontormo. <em>The Deposition</em>, a vivid and oddly contemporary painting completed in 1528, is widely regarded to be his surviving masterpiece. Even more thrilling is the private viewing gallery above the painting where the Grand Dukes of the Medici family used to attend mass in secret. It's a little odd to stand in Santa Felicita alone when just across the river tourists jostle to see Botticelli's Primavera in the Uffizi.</p> <p>A few streets west of Santa Felicita stands Santo Spirito (Piazza Santo Spirito). If the Duomo is inside out, then this is outside in. The 15th-century exterior has no fa\u00e7ade; it's just smooth stone. And yet it manages to stand both majestically and humbly at one end of this bustling little square. Inside and out, this is a Brunelleschi masterpiece of architecture. Santo Spirito's own guidebook lists 41 works of art, but the main attraction has to be a&#xa0;wooden crucifix of a naked Christ carved in 1493. Even with crucifix fatigue this can't fail to stun; there's something about the anatomical detail that suggests a master at work. It was only a decade ago that historians finally concluded the 18-year-old Michelangelo was indeed the sculptor.</p> <p>On the opposite side of the river, just a few streets away from our apartment, the church of Santa Trinita (Piazza Santa Trinita) doesn't look hugely promising from the outside. It's neither ornate nor plain, and as one becomes increasingly blas\u00e9 about the living museum that is Florence it would be easy to wander past. Of course there are fantastic frescoes, fading finally with age \u2013 there are frescoes everywhere in this city, and in any building you must always remember to look up at the ceiling just in case. Yet the frescoes in the Sassetti Chapel in Santa Trinita are something else. Here, almost unexpectedly, is a series of intricately painted frescoes by Ghirlandaio, who&#xa0;boasted Michelangelo as one of his many apprentices. <em>The Adoration of&#xa0;the Shepherds</em>, showing the birth of Jesus, is surrounded by scenes from the life of St Francis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396836290\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/9/26/1348673569707/Frescoes-in-the-Sassetti--001.jpg\" alt=\"Frescoes in the Sassetti Chapel in Santa Trinita\" width=\"460\" height=\"615\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frescoes in the Sassetti Chapel in Santa Trinita.

  "<p>Next Sunday in Soho Square, central London, a group of people will gather around a park bench. On that bench is&#xa0;a metal plaque with the words: <em>Kirsty MacColl 1959-2000 \"One Day I'll be Waiting There/ No Empty Bench in Soho Square\". </em>Assembled will be MacColl's family, friends and fans, come \u2013 as they do every year \u2013 to celebrate her birthday on the nearest Sunday.</p> <p>MacColl would have been 53 on 10&#xa0;October, and who knows what she would have been doing now (\"You could see her writing a musical,\" says the actor and comedian Tracey Ullman, \"or a play at the Royal Court with music.\") had she not been <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2003/feb/02/artsnews.mexico\" title=\"\">killed in December 2000</a>, run over by a speeding motorboat while diving with her sons in Mexico.</p> <p>\"She was a great writer, with warmth and humour and a keen ear and eye for humans and their foibles,\" says Jem Finer of the Pogues, who wrote the music for the timeless <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9jbdgZidu8\" title=\"\">Fairytale of New York</a>, on which MacColl duetted with Shane MacGowan. \"No&#xa0;bullshit or pretensions or posturing. A great singer and a genius with harmony.\"</p> <p>\"You know what I think she is?\" says Billy Bragg, whose song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv4CNoq8nC4\" title=\"\">A New England</a> she took to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrXl-KEaO5s\" title=\"\">No 7 in 1984</a>. \"I think she's the missing link between Sandie Shaw and Lily Allen. A couple of Christmases ago someone bought me one of those encyclopedias of rock. It was a real doorstep of a book. Kirsty wasn't in there, and I was really shocked by that. She was a huge talent who made brilliant records and wrote brilliant songs and deserves to be cherished among British songwriters.\"</p> <p>The reasons to cherish MacColl lie in the music she recorded, from her first single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1byhkWlWnQs\" title=\"\">They Don't Know</a> \u2013 a beautiful three-minute confection of 60s girl group and folk rock, as if the Byrds had been writing for the Shangri-Las in 1979 \u2013 to her final album, 2000's <a href=\"http://www.kirstymaccoll.com/music/albums/tropical_brainstorm/reviews/guardian.htm\" title=\"\"><em>Tropical Brainstorm</em></a>, on which she vigorously celebrated Latin American music.</p> <p>The common thread throughout was a withering and regretful eye for men and their defects, from the bad boy of the first single to the serial liar committing seduction against the background of a 1998 World Cup match on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7vsoVR5NX4\" title=\"\">England 2 Colombia 0</a> from <em>Tropical Brainstorm</em>.</p> <p>Mark Nevin, who wrote and performed with MacColl in the late 80s and early 90s says: \"If you took most songwriters, put all their lyrics into a computer and pressed 'equals' you'd get two lines that sum up everything [they'd written] in a nutshell. Kirsty's would be: 'All blokes are gonna lie, cheat and let you down'.\"</p> <p>So why, despite those glorious songs, is she not in Bragg's encyclopedia? MacColl's was the model of a stop-start career. She suffered from stage fright, which discouraged her from touring for much of her career. \"I said to her: 'If you get so worried, Kirsty, why don't you go and do something else?'\" remembers her mother, the dancer and choreographer Jean Newlove. \"Her eyes filled with tears and she said, 'But I love this. I can't think of anything I'd rather do.'\"</p> <p>She also insisted on making her own decisions \u2013 something she determined to do from an early age, her mother says \u2013 consistently refusing to have her career directed by the men of the record industry. So she switched between labels, never building up the momentum to lift her unassailably into the public consciousness. \"She didn't suffer fools,\" says her ex-husband Steve Lillywhite, who produced two of her albums, \"and to be honest, to make it in the business \u2013 especially if you're a woman \u2013 you have to suffer fools.\"</p> <p>And so we're left with a smattering of singles and only five albums, recorded between 1981 and 2000. The first four \u2013 <em>Desperate Character</em>, <em>Kite</em>, <em>Electric Landlady</em> and <em>Titanic Days</em> \u2013 are <a href=\"http://www.unionsquaremusic.co.uk/shop/cd.asp?Marid=349&amp;arid=2140\" title=\"\">being reissued</a> the day after the birthday celebration, and listening to them afresh, one after the other, provides a vivid reminder of MacColl's talent. She could capture the world in songs that seamlessly interweave heartbreak and humour (\"There's a guy works down the chip shop swears he's Elvis/ Just like you swore to me that you'd be true,\" she sang on her<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL2GmaI3Xus\" title=\"\"> breakthrough hit</a>) set against a constantly evolving musical background.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/F6K8R8KqpCE?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/F6K8R8KqpCE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>MacColl immersed herself in music as a child. Not the music of her father, the folk singer and songwriter Ewan MacColl, but pop. Though he had left Newlove for Peggy Seeger, his will was known to his daughter. \"I was very aware of the fact that he disapproved completely of anything he regarded as commercial,\" she later said. \"Her dad was very scornful of pop music,\" Bragg says. \"He really didn't like it at all. Not just her doing it, but anyone doing it.\"</p> <p>Nevin believes her father exerted an influence in one way, though, through his having left: \"She didn't talk about her dad much, but it was an underlying thing that coloured the way she saw the world \u2013 men would let you down and mess you about.\"</p> <p>Since her dad was absent, MacColl could sing along to her brother Hamish's singles, apparently teaching herself the vocal harmony parts to the Beach Boys's Good Vibrations when she was seven. Newlove remembers her daughter waiting for the musical interludes in Andy Williams' TV show: \"Kirsty would take her violin out of the case and accompany him. I would have a quiet laugh to myself, but she took it very seriously. Then she'd put the violin away until Andy Williams came out for another song, and out would come the violin.\" Newlove thinks MacColl started writing songs after she passed her English O-level early, at 14, leaving her with free periods to while away in the teacher's office. She'd been a prodigious writer since early childhood \u2013 a piece she wrote when she was seven for a competition run by the <em>Observer </em>was published in a Penguin book edited by the educationalist Edward Blishen, <em>The School That I'd Like </em>\u2013 but now her thoughts turned to writing pop. In her late teens&#xa0;she joined a punk band called the Drug Addix.</p> <p>\"This was a far cry from what I expected,\" Newlove says. \"'What's your daughter doing?' 'Oh, she's one of the Drug Addix!' I went to pick her up when she did her first gig. I stood downstairs waiting and a man said to me: 'Cor, listen to those kids. I can't stand it, can you?' I didn't want to say, 'No, it's dreadful,' so I just weakly smiled.\"</p> <p>Still, the Drug Addix were enough to get MacColl signed in her own right to Stiff, and so came They Don't Know. It had \"hit\" stamped all over it: great song, great arrangement, great musicians. It was all over the radio \u2013 the second most played song in the UK one week. But a strike at Stiff's distributors meant the single didn't reach the shops, and it didn't even enter the singles chart.</p> <p>One of the many joys contained in They Don't Know is MacColl's voice. The time spent practising the vocal parts in Good Vibrations was echoed down her career. She adored Brian Wilson, and used to layer her own voice to create distinctive velvet harmonies like the Beach Boys had done, which became a trademark. \"She would sing like a keyboard,\" Lillywhite remembers. \"She sang without vibrato and when you don't have vibrato you have this wonderful glassy sound, which is how you can get that Beach Boys thing.\"</p> <p>\"She knew how to use her voice,\" Bragg says. \"She'd tell the engineer where to put the mics, and she'd tell the producer what she was going to do next. She did this amazing thing where she'd do a take, then go round into a different position and do another take to layer up this amazing sound, then: 'That's all. Let's go to the pub.\" Though eight years elapsed between MacColl's first album in 1981 and its follow-up, <em>Kite</em> \u2013 arguably her best \u2013 MacColl wasn't idle. She brought up the two sons she and Lillywhite had after getting married in 1984; sang on plenty of sessions, notably Fairytale of New York; and two other artists got significant boosts thanks to her.</p> <p>One was Tracey Ullman, then an up-and-coming comedian on the TV shows <em>A Kick Up the Eighties</em> and <em>Three of a Kind</em>. \"I got obsessed with They Don't Know,\" she says. \"I used to play it and play it and play it.\" When Ullman started recording for Stiff in 1983 she had a big hit with the song \u2013 accompanied by a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvZSdCTcS-A\" title=\"\">video starring Paul McCartney</a> \u2013 and recorded several other MacColl numbers. Ullman has been in America for 30 years now, winning Emmys along the way, \"but my entry to America was getting into the Billboard top 10 with Kirsty's song \u2013 they got me over to be one of the first MTV veejays\".</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MrXl-KEaO5s?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MrXl-KEaO5s\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Billy Bragg, meanwhile, says he owes her for the push that made him a crossover pop star of sorts. \"I was indie No 1 \u2013 the Smiths' first album pushed me off No 1 \u2013 that's where I was,\" he says of his position in the early 80s before MacColl had a hit with A New England in December 1984. \"<em>Life's a Riot</em> [his debut album, featuring his original of the song] had already gone silver; within two weeks of her getting in the charts it went gold.\" These days, when he plays A New England live, he always adds the extra verse from her version. \"I shout, 'Let's the sing the last verse for Kirsty!', and everyone cheers. There's still a great deal of love for her.\"</p> <p>By the time <em>Kite</em> was released in 1989, MacColl's writing had changed \u2013 it was still personal, witty and engaged but now it was in her own voice. \"I know the reason why,\" Mark Nevin says of the change in tone. \"It was Morrissey. She said: 'I heard the Smiths and realised, I get it \u2013 I can write about anything.' She didn't have to write songs that sounded like they'd been written by songwriters. That was the thing that transformed her writing.\" Where before there had been what Bragg calls \"Play for Today songs\", now the eye for a bitter truth was combined with a weightless touch for the right phrase: \"What else is there to do/ But turn and wet the baby's head/ And pray he will be happier than you and me?\" she sings, devastatingly, on Tread Lightly.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3E7wHBG3WWo?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3E7wHBG3WWo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\"She always said, and I believed her, that the songs were pretty much not about one specific person,\" says Lillywhite, who produced <em>Kite</em> and its successor, <em>Electric Landlady</em>. \"But later on, after we'd made our amends, she said they were probably more about me than she had realised at the time.\"</p> <p><em>Titanic Days</em>, released in 1993, was not a happy time. First, MacColl's marriage was ending. Then there was another new label. Then the album was all but ignored by the world. MacColl resolved not to make another record until she was happy \u2013 and so it was seven years before <em>Tropical Brainstorm</em> was released in 2000, to a delighted reception, before her return was ended abruptly by the tragedy in Mexico.</p> <p>Like most re-releases, the four MacColl albums will probably slip by, barely noticed. Dedicated fans might update their copies, scouting for previously unissued bonus tracks. If any DJs pick up the albums, some new listeners might hear a singer they don't know on the radio. Maybe one or two people will read a review or an article like this, investigate further and discover one of English music's most vivid songwriting personalities. Fame will be as distant as it was when she was still making records.</p> <p>\"Being a pop star is a bit daft,\" Bragg says. \"If you go for that you have to give up your personality. Jessie J would be a good example \u2013 what's she like offstage? Who knows? Or Cheryl Cole? What's she like when she's kicked back in front of the telly, having a fag and a beer? I don't think Kirsty could ever have been that kind of pop star.\"</p> <p><em>Kirsty MacColl's first four albums will be reissued on Salvo on 8 October</em></p>",
  "<p>\"Those who would meanly and coldly forget their old mother could not be expected to be faithful to their young bride.\" So Senator Carl Schurz, as the first German-born American elected to the US Senate, defended his multiple identities in 1872. What was more, he had a clear response to the canard of \"my country, right or wrong\": \"if right, to be kept right; and if wrong, to be set right.\"</p> <p>Such questions of identity, affiliation and assimilation are behind <a href=\"http://www.soutphommasane.com.au/\" title=\"\">Tim Soutphommasane's</a> intriguing treatise, which urges liberals to support a conception of citizenship in which strangers \"share a commitment to and special concern for their country and fellow compatriots\". Forget cosmopolitanism; embrace patriotism.</p> <p>The work adds to a growing literature addressing the conundrum of how to foster national identity in an age of mass migration \u2013 the challenge of which is only heightened by radical Islam and the \"war on terror\". President Sarkozy responded to the threat of multiculturalism by banning the niqab; Australia witnessed the birth of Pauline Hanson's nativist One Nation party; and the UK has had its perpetual symposium on Britishness.</p> <p>Soutphommasane's book begins with a familiar demand for the left to engage with the virtues of patriotism. George Orwell is invoked, and Soutphommasane then aligns himself with the school of liberal nationalism. For years now, the likes of Michael Lind and David Miller have argued that \"liberal goals cannot reliably be achieved except in societies whose members share a common national identity\". And that identity is not simply inherited, but rather shaped and reshaped by a process of inclusive, interpretative debate.</p> <p>However, where Soutphommasane thinks the liberal nationalists have gone wrong is in failing to frame their argument in the language of patriotism and civic virtue. Mind you, not any old patriotism. Soutphommasane is not interested in \"constitutional patriotism\", which is too transactional in terms of citizenship rights. Nor does he want \"republican patriotism\", which can elide into blood and soil nationalism.</p> <p>Instead, he argues for a turn to what <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/billy-bragg?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Billy Bragg</a> would call progressive patriotism. This conscious celebration of a more cohesive narrative of cultural identity would take place in parliaments, schools, civil bodies and the media. In policy terms, Soutphommasane suggests a hearty focus on the teaching of national history in schools \u2013 although this should be carried out in a&#xa0;reasonable rather than emotional way, giving full expression to \"emotional generosity\" (good luck with that on a Thursday afternoon with Year 10). And when it comes to managed migration, he rightly argues for a policy of acculturation to national culture alongside the accommodation of minority perspectives in public institutions and practices.</p> <p>It is all sensible stuff. But liberal nationalism with a culturalist turn demands some heavy lifting \u2013 a lot of critical dialogues, minimising moral disagreements, and searching for common ground. This patriotism cannot rely on instinct or emotion. And the book itself is not without its challenges. Here is Orwell describing Englishness: \"It is somehow bound up with solid breakfasts and gloomy Sundays, smoky towns and winding roads, green fields and red pillar boxes. Moreover it is continuous, it stretches into the future and the past, there is something in it that persists, as in a living creature.\" Soutphommasane writes: \"By replacing 'unconditional' modes of national identification with 'post-conventional' processes of identity-formation, constitutional patriotism brings about the 'rationalisation of collective identities'.\"</p> <p>Perhaps an unfair comparison, but it does highlight two criticisms. The first is the lack of particularity: for a thesis so rightly concerned with the intimacies of national identity, this is a broad-brushed work of political science that seeks to impose the policy solutions of Canada and Australia on Britain. In particular, it fails to deal with the issue of welfare and identity in the context of mass migration \u2013 the question of migrant need versus indigenous contribution, of&#xa0;diversity versus solidarity.</p> <p>Secondly, Soutphommasane overlooks the current state of the United Kingdom. Orwell spoke of Englishness as distinct from Britishness. And any question of cultural patriotism needs to be interwoven within our debate about Scottish independence.</p> <p>That said, this is a worthy contribution to current thinking on liberal nationalism, identity and migration. It marks another welcome rejection of the \"community of communities\" multiculturalism of the late 1990s, as we rediscover the ties that bind in a liberal polity. And it's encouraging to see that Labour party policy supremo <a href=\"http://www.joncruddas.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Jon Cruddas</a> has been drawing on Soutphommasane's work in his own meditations on national identity. But Dr Soutphommasane could really do with making his case as punchily as Senator Schurz.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.tristramhunt.com/web/\" title=\"\"><em>Tristram Hunt</em></a><em> is MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central</em></p>",
  "<p>At one point in <em>The Cutting Season</em>, <a href=\"http://www.atticalocke.com/\" title=\"\">Attica Locke</a>'s stunning second novel, a man is utterly blind-sided when he comes upon the preserved slave quarters at the Louisiana plantation house, Belle Vie. \"Each cabin, silhouetted by the newly set sun, was no more than a few feet wide, smaller than some of the SUVs riding on American highways,\" writes Locke. \"Their spindly columns were like tired arms at the end of a long day's work, nearly crushed beneath the weight of what they were being asked to hold up\u2026 No person should experience this moment alone, this face-to-face meeting with one's history.\"</p> <p>In a sense, coming face to face with history is what <em>The Cutting Season</em> is all about. Today, Belle Vie plays host to weddings and parties, its slave cabins used to re-enact the past in a cringingly awful play put on for tourists, \"as soapy as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/36144/gone.with.the.wind\" title=\"\"><em>Gone with the Wind</em></a>, full of belles and balls and star-crossed lovers, noble Confederates and happy darkies and more dirty Yankees than you could count\". The ancestors of the site's manager, Caren Grey, worked the land as slaves, her mother was the cook there, and as a child Caren played with the white children of the owners before their differing social status put paid to the friendship. Now she works for them, and is reminded constantly what she owes the family.</p> <p>When the body of a migrant worker from the industrial sugar cane farm next door is found on the land, throat slit, Caren finds herself confronting two mysteries: that of the death, today, of In\u00e9s Avalo, and that of the suspicious disappearance 137 years ago of her great-great-great-grandfather Jason. Tensions mount as Caren discovers blood on the sleeve of her nine-year-old daughter's shirt. Like In\u00e9s, she&#xa0;feels she is being followed, and senses that&#xa0;her family are no longer safe in Belle Vie at night.</p> <p>We know from the novel's opening that the plantation is \"not to be trusted... that beneath its loamy topsoil, the manicured grounds and gardens, two&#xa0;centuries of breathtaking wealth and spectacle, lay a land both black and bitter, soft to the touch, but pressing in its power\". Despite its reinvention as a tourist attraction, the old injustices live on: just next to where the slaves were&#xa0;once housed, the overseer of the cane farm treats his migrant workers with astonishing brutality; and one of Caren's black actors is accused of the murder, despite the evidence pointing elsewhere.</p> <p>History in the novel is a palpable presence, and presses down on the present with suffocating force. In the old cabin of Caren's ancestor, which she almost believes is haunted, the air is \"so still it cut, the feeling that you could never get enough breath, no matter how hard you tried\". Soaked in atmosphere, in the wet, drunk air of the south where \"the cane,&#xa0;like cut grass and sweet milk, damp and terrestrial\" pervades everything, the past lies in layers upon layers in this story.</p> <p>Locke was shortlisted for the Orange prize for her debut thriller, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/thrillers/9781846687297/black-water-rising\" title=\"\"><em>Black Water Rising</em></a>.

  "<p>The seasons are turning. In Britain, with an oceanic climate and the mellowing influence of the Gulf Stream, the days become progressively cooler, early morning frosts soon thaw in the autumn sunshine, and the descent into winter is a gradual affair. I have just returned from a trip to Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks, where summer was just about to become winter, with an abruptness that still surprises even a well-travelled Briton. But humans in the central United States and Britain generally respond to the onset of the cold with similar changes in behaviour, spending more time indoors and digging out woolly jumpers from the bottom drawer. Other animals react by finding a suitable den in which to slumber through the months of cold.</p> <p>The taxi driver who took me to Jackson Hole Airport told me that it would be snowing within two weeks. The grizzly bears of Grand Teton would already be looking for somewhere to hibernate. Many birds, being among the most mobile of vertebrates, take to the wing and fly south to find warmth. Some North American and northern European humans do the same, overwintering in Mediterranean refugia.</p> <p>We're enjoying a relatively long and stable period of pleasant weather at the moment. And by that, I don't mean the past few years or decades. I mean the past 12,000 years or so. For around 2.6m years, the Earth has experienced a fluctuating climate, swinging between icy glaciations and warm interglacials. It's an uneven division, with glaciations lasting around 100,000 years, and interglacials just 10,000 to 15,000. So just imagine the impact on plants and animals of these switches from long, wintry glaciations to brief, summery interglacials. The differences in climate are extreme. At the peak of the last ice age, just 20,000 years ago, vast ice sheets descended over the northern parts of Europe and North America. For any animals adapted to a temperate climate, glaciations posed something of a challenge. Hibernation and woolly jumpers would not be enough to ride out 100,000 years of winter. Those warm-loving animals (and humans) cleared out of the north and sought refuge in the south.</p> <p>But don't imagine bands, packs and herds streaming southwards. Most populations simply went extinct in northern latitudes, leaving their southern cousins to carry the torch for their species. Pollen records show the same thing happening to plants: many types of tree simply became extinct in northern Europe in the run-up to the peak of the last ice age.</p> <p>Even for those populations of plants or animals living in a habitable area \u2013 or refugium \u2013 in the south, survival right through a glaciation is far from guaranteed. The refugium may just be too small to support a viable population, especially for large-bodied animals or carnivores. Often the last glimpse of extinct ice-age species in the fossil record comes from relict populations clinging on in southern refugia, just before their species light is extinguished. Neanderthals are often thought of as being \"cold-adapted\". They might have been a bit stockier than us, but they're not by any means an Arctic species. They existed in Europe for some 200,000 years, but like all the other temperate-adapted animals, they cleared out of northern Europe during glaciations and hunkered down in southern refugia. We see them for the last time in the southernmost tip of the Iberian peninsula, living in caves on the Rock of Gibraltar, around 28,000 years ago. And then they're gone.</p> <p><a href=\"http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2009/10/22/rspb.2009.1272\" title=\"\">Refugia are not just places where extinction is more likely, though.</a> They are also places where new species are born. Fragmented, isolated populations are likely to evolve in different directions. For warm-loving species, the south may provide an important refugium during a glaciation, but a few small populations may also be able to hang on in pockets of suitable habitat in the north. Some time in the past 300,000 years, a population of brown bears clung on through a long glaciation in an isolated northern refugium \u2013 perhaps in Ireland. Those bears gradually adapted to the icy north. They became a new species \u2013 of&#xa0;white, polar bears.</p> <p>Our own species may have appeared&#xa0;in a similar way, in a glacial refugium. It's thought that modern humans (<em>Homo sapiens</em>) and Neanderthals (<em>Homo neanderthalensis</em>) evolved from the same ancestral species: <em>Homo heidelbergensis</em>. It's likely that these ancient humans spread across Africa, Europe and Asia during an interglacial, then the population became fragmented during&#xa0;a glaciation.<a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/335/6074/1317.abstract\" title=\"\">Each isolated group of ancestors evolved in a different direction: in the European refugium, they became Neanderthals; in Africa, they became modern humans.</a> A later interglacial provided modern humans with the opportunity to expand out of Africa and across the&#xa0;globe. At the peak of the last glaciation, the modern human population was hit hard, but we&#xa0;survived.</p> <p>So here we are, in an interglacial. It's sobering to remember that this is just a brief interlude. Some time fairly soon, we'll probably begin the descent into a long glacial winter again. When that happens, all the temperate-adapted animals that currently range widely across the northern hemisphere will clear out of the far north. Ice sheets will grow down over North America and northern Europe again. Our civilisations have grown up in this unseasonably stable (and already overlong) warm interglacial. We've grown a huge global population in this favourable climate. It will be even more difficult to support such a massive number of people when the world becomes colder and drier again.</p> <p>But for those cold-adapted animals that are currently hanging out in Arctic refugia, things will look up. If polar bears manage to cling on, there'll be much more room for them in the next&#xa0;glaciation.</p>",
  "<p>For years now, people have played the dull pub game What's Your Porn Name?</p> <p>In case you've managed to avoid gatherings where it's been discussed (which is a long shot, but perhaps your friends are hard, angry, silent drinkers, in which case, you've got lucky), this involves combining the name of your first pet with your mother's maiden name to create the pseudonym you'd use if you were a porn star.</p> <p>It never comes out as anything interesting. Nobody's first pet, or mother, ever turns out to have had a name that sounds funny for sex work. People simply take it in turns to disappoint the group with \"Buster Smith\" or \"Susan Jenkins\".</p> <p>You may think I'm bitter because my own \"porn name\" is dull, but guess again; my mother was born into the Aplenti family and I called my goldfish Tits. I just don't like the game.</p> <p>A better version, I think, would be What's Your Tory Party Chairman Name?</p> <p>You get this by googling your porn name, then taking the first normal name that appears in the top hit. Mine is William Coles. Yours will be similarly boring, but, in this variant, dullness is a virtue. You're not trying to get remembered in the sex trade, you're trying to get elected.</p> <p>So you want to be a solid-sounding type, an everyman.</p> <p>You need a name that doesn't reveal anything at all. This is purely for parliamentary use; the messy complexities of actual life can play out under a different moniker. Think back to porn; when meeting their kids' schoolteachers, I suspect that Courtney Cummz and Arnold Schwarzenpecker go by something else.</p> <p>Your Tory Party Chairman Name should be a tabula rasa for public trust. Mine, \"William Coles\", is perfect. Who wouldn't vote for William Coles? Good old Colesy. Firm but fair. Confident but reasonable. Strong in a crisis. Just looking at my new name on the page, I know I would implement a kindly yet sensible immigration policy.</p> <p>\"Grant Shapps\" would be another good one. Short, brisk, efficient, not a syllable wasted. There's a guy who'll scale down the red tape.</p> <p>\"Michael Green\" would also work well. Although \"Grant Shapps\" just edges it \u2013 according to the current Tory chairman, anyway, who chose to be Grant Shapps for politics and (until 2008) Michael Green for business purposes.</p> <p>Last week, photographs emerged of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/21/grant-shapps-posed-web-guru\" title=\"\">Grant Shapps</a> wearing a badge identifying him as Michael Green at a 2004 internet conference in Las Vegas. Some people have said the photo raises questions about his credibility, but I can't see what's sinister about a major government figure grinning from behind a false name at a Las Vegas conference while simultaneously applying to be an MP in another country under a different name entirely.</p> <p>OK, it looks weird. But you should see what Theresa May gets up to in Bolivia under the name Desir\u00e9e Van Hump.</p> <p>For avoidance of doubt: I don't think Theresa May gets up to anything in Bolivia under the name Desir\u00e9e Van Hump, but I'd be delighted for her if she did. There is too much pressure on politicians to fit a rigid modern PR profile.</p> <p>Nobody human could be as flawless as a 21st-century MP is required to appear. I think they should all be given a second identity, immediately on election, for breathing space.</p> <p>Look at the hysteria surrounding <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/26/andrew-mitchell-deterioration-police\" title=\"\">Andrew Mitchell</a>. He shouted hysterically at a policeman. The policeman hysterically threatened to have him arrested for swearing. The Labour party hysterically demanded a \"full public inquiry\". Others called hysterically for Mitchell's resignation. John Tully, head of the Metropolitan Police Federation, says: \"This has gone way beyond an apology or even a resignation; Mr Mitchell now needs to be sacked\" \u2013 which is so hysterical that I'm worried Mr Tully's crinoline is too tight and he's going to faint away on the parlour floor.</p> <p>Everyone in that paragraph needs their heads banging together, and the rest of us shouldn't have wasted 10 seconds' attention on this nonsense \u2013 as we would not have done if Andrew Mitchell's tantrum could have been blamed immediately on his naughty alter ego, Grumpy Wisbeech. If politicians can't lose their tempers for fear of sacking, then they need doppelgangers who can.</p> <p>We all have a best self from which we occasionally deviate (how would <em>you</em> fare if a full public inquiry was demanded every time you did something wrong?), and a spare persona could be just the thing to keep our MPs sane in this age of incessant filming, recording, analysis and commentary, where investigations and resignations can be triggered by an ill-timed sneeze.</p> <p>It all went wrong when the concept of the career politician was born. When a chap (or lady, but, let's be honest, it was usually chap) spent 20 years as a doctor, a lawyer, a miner or a soldier before going to the Commons, a broad and bumpy personality was standard. Now they all glide down the conveyor belt from student politics degree to thinktank to public office, there's an expectation of constant diplomacy. Anything below the surface is opaque. Like potential royal brides, they arrive with skeleton-free closets and smooth, glassy smiles.</p> <p>In such an environment, a lapse of temper (or sobriety, or fidelity, or mere manners) can end a career. But the absence of lapses is eerie. That way lies Tony Blair, whose smiling face I can no longer see without hearing the sound of wind chimes and distant screaming.</p> <p>So, lest we are to be ruled solely by sociopaths and Blair's robot children, we should give them all a Bunbury option: a \"Michael Green\", under whose name to exercise all the human complexity for which modern politics cannot currently find room.

  "<p>A German director deserving to be better known in England, Christian Petzold has a particular interest in the problems attendant upon his country's reunification. In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/sep/21/thriller.worldcinema\" title=\"\"><em>Yella</em></a> he forged a gripping business thriller out of the dilemmas of an accountant escaping from her psychopathic husband in a moribund town on the Polish border to work in Hanover for a shifty businessman exploiting companies on the brink of collapse. His&#xa0;new film centres on Dr Barbara Wolff, a paediatrician exiled to a remote East German hospital on the Baltic coast east of L\u00fcbeck in 1980 after having had the temerity to apply for a visa to join her lover in the west. The cruel Stasi are all around, undermining decent relationships, ever&#xa0;ready to conduct strip-searches at&#xa0;the hint of any offence against the state, and they rightly suspect Barbara of being up to something \u2013 in fact plotting to get out illegally.</p> <p>Working for the fifth time with Petzold, Nina Hoss, who was so good in <em>Yella</em>, brings an agonised decency and sense of moral probity to Barbara, and we truly feel for her as she's torn between her allegiance to the Hippocratic oath, even under an intolerable regime, and her right to freedom and a good life. But the movie is neither as well shaped nor as persuasive as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/115216/lives.of.others\" title=\"\"><em>The Lives of Others</em></a>, with which it inevitably invites comparison, and there's something overly contrived and melodramatic about the way Barbara's options are set out. Nevertheless, this is a film of consequence, and it's good to be reminded of how much better life is for&#xa0;most people in eastern Europe than&#xa0;it was a quarter of a century ago.</p>",
  "<p>Rio Ferdinand has never revealed the identity of the footballer he once heard racially abusing one of West&#xa0;Ham's players. A seasoned professional, very well\u2011known, with a good reputation, is all that Ferdinand has been willing to give away. Someone who \"comes over as quite a nice bloke\" and is still involved in the game. \"If I named the player, no one would believe it,\" Ferdinand writes in his autobiography. \"I guarantee, you'd be astonished.\"</p> <p>Ferdinand was a teenager at the time, establishing himself in the West Ham side, and when he spoke to his team-mate afterwards he discovered the player who was shouting the abuse came out with the same stuff every time the teams played each other.</p> <p>Looking back, Ferdinand thinks his team-mate did the wrong thing by not reporting it. He regrets not complaining himself, but he was young, not sure anyone wanted to listen, and&#xa0;he considers it pointless now because, legally, there is nothing he can do to prove it. Which is a pity, because there is at least one witness, and potentially others, and if more players are outed this way maybe the message will get through to the people running the game that offences of this nature warrant appropriate punishments.</p> <p>Nobody expected the FA to put John Terry in stocks, find a busy spot on Oxford Street and start chucking rotten tomatoes at him, but what a dysfunctional system we have when calling an opponent a \"fucking black cunt\" is worth one more game out&#xa0;than, say, Lee Cattermole's red card at MK Dons on Tuesday. Where Ferdinand has let himself down is the \"choc-ice\" message he posted on Twitter, meaning black on the outside and white on the inside, after Ashley Cole had given evidence on Terry's behalf before the Chelsea captain was acquitted at Westminster magistrates' court.</p> <p>What nobody can dispute, however, is that the Manchester United player has done his bit over the years. Ferdinand was the driving force, alongside Thierry Henry, behind the Stand Up, Speak Up campaign. He has been a powerful voice for Give Racism the Red Card and was part of a European parliament campaign a few years ago to put pressure on Uefa into take racism more seriously and get out of this ridiculous cycle whereby offenders are punished with crumby, almost inconsequential, fines.</p> <p>It cannot have been easy digesting the news that his England career has been brought to an end because of someone else's racial insults. Which is how Ferdinand sees his exclusion in the first four months of&#xa0;the Roy Hodgson era, convinced he is&#xa0;being left out because he happens to be the elder brother of the player the FA has now decided was racially abused when QPR played Chelsea last October. Hodgson chose Terry and sacrificed Ferdinand, and Sir Alex Ferguson is correct to say there is probably no way England's manager can bring him back now.</p> <p>How could there be when Hodgson has argued from day one that Ferdinand was left out purely for \"footballing reasons\" and not because of the broken state of his relationship with Terry? Hodgson used that line even when Martin Kelly, a Liverpool reserve, came in ahead of Ferdinand for Euro 2012 \u2013 and it doesn't particularly matter whether you take him at his word or think it is one step down from Alan Partridge talking about his friendship with Bono. The point is, from here, it is difficult to see any way out of this mess. By inviting Ferdinand back, Hodgson would arguably be recruiting the best replacement for England, post-Terry. He would also be taking a sledgehammer to his own story and the chances of that happening are slim in the extreme.</p> <p>Hodgson is now in a position where he names his squad on Thursday for England's next two World Cup qualifiers, against San Marino and Poland, and will be deprived of the two outstanding English centre-backs of the past decade. Terry ended his international career on the night before his disciplinary hearing began and is now considering an appeal whereas Ferdinand has been kept out, it appears, for political reasons. Which may not matter at home to San Marino, whose record since 1990 reads one win, three draws, 107 defeats, 19 goals scored and 473 conceded. It may, however, when England play in Warsaw on 16 October, when another bad result \u2013 on the back of the 1-1 draw&#xa0;against Ukraine \u2013 would really leave Hodgson's team in a vulnerable position, in a group from which only the winners automatically qualify.</p> <p>This is not to overlook the fact that Ferdinand had a difficult game against Tottenham on Saturday or the qualities of Joleon Lescott and Phil Jagielka, now the first-choice partnership and both accomplished players, despite the mistakes they made against Ukraine. Long term, Chris Smalling and Phil Jones have legitimate reasons to believe they can play together in the next World Cup. Gary Cahill is a fine defender, who has flourished since joining Chelsea, and, privately, may be aggrieved not to have started against Ukraine. Yet an England manager has a&#xa0;duty, surely, to pick the best people and it would be unfair to dismiss Ferdinand's credentials on the basis of one poor game when he was also United's best defender at Liverpool last weekend.</p> <p>Hodgson has made it clear that he is happy to pick players who are in their 30s. He has talked about the importance of defenders with good technique, who can keep the ball, and he has regularly bemoaned the fact he currently has to choose so many players who are not getting a regular game with their clubs. Ferdinand ticks every box.</p> <p>True, he is not the player he once was, certainly not as jet-heeled, as Gareth Bale demonstrated on Saturday. At 33, however, we are still talking about someone who is good enough to play for the most successful team in the country. Ferdinand has also come out of that difficult period a couple of years ago when his body seemed to be failing him and he could manage only around 40% of United's fixtures. A twinge meant he did not play in the opening two games of the season but, before that, the last time he missed a league match because of injury was 22 January. Only one player, Wayne Rooney, started more league games for United last season.</p> <p>What Hodgson should be doing is investigating whether it is possible to integrate Ferdinand back into a squad featuring Cole and trying to find out if they are willing to play alongside each other, even if their relationship has disintegrated beyond repair.</p> <p>What will happen, almost certainly, is something very different. Steven Caulker of Tottenham is being tipped to be the immediate beneficiary of Terry's absence \u2013 a young, talented centre-half but yet another player who is not a regular starter for his club.Lescott, Jagielka and Cahill are now mandatory picks and the same will apply to Jones and Smalling when they are back from injury. Which is strange itself. Fine players, undoubtedly, but Jones and Smalling have something else in common. They are both understudies at United to the man who now sees his name prefixed by the words \"ex-England international\", stuck on 81 caps, suspecting that is probably it.</p>",
  "<p>Ed Miliband will make his boldest, most controversial policy commitment since becoming Labour leader on Sunday when he pledges to force the break-up of Britain's biggest banks unless they agree to revolutionise their operations and put ordinary customers first.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/sep/29/ed-miliband-banks-gurus-coalitions\" title=\"\">In an interview with the Observer</a>, the Labour leader says he will confront the City of London with what is seen as the nuclear option for reform if the banks fail to separate their \"casino\" investment operations from services to account-holders, savers and businesses.</p> <p>In terms that will incense the investment banking industry, Miliband says a Labour government, as one of its first acts, would push through a modern-day equivalent of the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, which split the commercial and investment operations of US banks after the 1929 stock market crash.</p> <p>The move is part of an attempt by Miliband to flesh out his promise to deliver a more \"responsible capitalism\" \u2013 amid signs that the public does not yet believe he is tough enough, nor has a sufficiently clear vision, to be prime minister.</p> <p>Speaking ahead of Labour's annual conference, opening in Manchester on Sunday, Miliband says banks must concentrate on core functions such as lending to small businesses \"rather than playing the international money markets\". Such behaviour puts ordinary customers at risk of having to share the consequences of failed investments.</p> <p>Echoing concerns expressed last month by Sir Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, who believes that reforms proposed last year by Sir John Vickers are being \"watered down\" after lobbying by the banks, Miliband said it was time to stop backsliding and change banking culture for good. The recent Libor scandal involving the fiddling of inter-bank interest rates and the \u00a310bn scandal over mis-selling of payment protection insurance showed the culture was still rotten.</p> <p>Miliband said: \"Either they can do it themselves \u2013 which frankly is not what has happened over the past year \u2013 or the next Labour government will, by law, break up retail and investment banks.</p> <p>\"The banks and the government can change direction and say they are going to implement the spirit and principle of Vickers to the full. That means the hard ringfence between retail and investment banking. We need real separation, real culture change. Or we will legislate.\"</p> <p>The coalition government says it will implement the majority of the Vickers report, which will be the subject of legislation due to reach the statute book by 2015. But the changes will not come into effect until 2019. The plans have, however, been watered down, with ministers agreeing that the ringfence will only apply to the UK operations of banks \u2013 even though many in the UK have vast overseas operations.</p> <p>Vickers also wanted the government to insist that banks hold higher grade assets in their reserves to insure against another financial collapse. But the government relented after the industry complained that buying these assets would be expensive and the \u00a31.3bn estimated cost would be passed to customers.</p> <p>Miliband called on Saturday for the \"rebuilding of Britain\" and for 16-year-olds to be given the vote. Speaking to the<em> Observer</em>, he said: \"It is incredibly important to show that we 'get it' on spending. We are very serious about understanding that the next Labour government is going to face difficult economic times.\"</p> <p>But fiscal discipline had to be balanced with an appreciation that borrowing was rising faster because the government had cut too deep and fast. \"If you don't have a growing economy, businesses aren't paying taxes, people are claiming benefits and it is not working. So it is a two-pronged approach.\"</p> <p>Labour is a solid 10 points ahead of the Conservatives, according to the latest <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/sep/29/labour-tories-10-points-conference\" title=\"\">Opinium/Observer poll</a>.

Depressingly for Labour, 29% say the coalition government is responsible for the state of the economy, against 46% who blame the last Labour government.</p> <p>Jon Cruddas, who heads Labour's policy review, tells BBC's <em>Sunday Politics London</em> that Labour could retain the coalition's limit on immigration. Asked whether Labour could stick to the 21,700 cap on non-EU immigrants, he said: \"We're looking at it, obviously. It's part of our review of the whole area. We haven't got a specific position on it, in terms of the level at the moment, but it's something that we're monitoring.\"</p>",
  "<p>A century ago this year, Robert Falcon Scott and his group of fellow explorers reached the south pole. Although ending in tragedy their story inspired generations, setting in motion 100 years of polar exploration and a century of scientific research.</p> <p>I am an ornithologist and for me the most memorable story from Scott's expedition is that of Edward Wilson's mid-winter trek to the emperor penguin breeding colony at Cape Crozier. This scientific foray was later dubbed the \"worst journey in the world\".</p> <p>Scott wrote of it as \"One of the most gallant stories in polar history. That men should wander forth in the depth of a polar night to face the most dismal cold and the fiercest gales in darkness is something new; that they should have persisted in this effort in spite of every adversity for five full weeks is heroic. It makes a tale for our generation which I hope may not be lost in the telling.\"</p> <p>In the footsteps of these pioneers, British scientists continue to work on the southern continent today, venturing into the most hostile conditions on Earth, in search of knowledge. The British Antarctic Survey (BAS) collects data on, among other things, climate change, ice dynamics, ecosystems and fisheries \u2013 both in the Antarctic and the Arctic \u2013 and over the decades has made a series of world-changing discoveries. For example, BAS scientist Joe Farman's research in Antarctica first alerted the world to the threat of ozone depletion, and in so doing helped avert an ecological catastrophe.</p> <p>Next month a 12-strong BAS team will use a custom-built hot-water drill to penetrate a three-kilometre layer of ice to reach the waters of the subglacial Lake Ellsworth on the west Antarctic ice sheet. Taking 16 years to plan, this investigation will open new research into the Earth's past climate and could reveal new life forms.</p> <p>Times have certainly changed since Scott's famous Terra Nova expedition, but there is a new epic tale that I also hope will not be lost in the telling. It is one of ministers looking for spending cuts, cuts that could soon lead to the world's most respected polar research organisation being closed down.</p> <p>Considering the importance of polar research in understanding global change, it is alarming that the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), a research funding body reporting to Vince Cable's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, has published proposals to close the BAS headquarters in Cambridge, doing away with its name, and thereby making it politically easier to make deep cuts in Antarctic bases, ships and aircraft later on.</p> <p>The extent of the seismic shifts about to take place are underlined by the recent departure of senior staff. The director, deputy director and a board member have all left BAS over the past six months, and disillusioned with current events, senior scientists are contemplating moving to other institutions. BAS is vulnerable and the Whitehall axe could soon strike with devastating effects.</p> <p>Having been burned last year by the public outrage over proposals to sell England's forests and close the Forestry Commission, the proposals that would do away with BAS have been carefully crafted. At one level they look quite reasonable, for example in suggesting a merger between BAS and the National Oceanography Centre based in Southampton and Liverpool.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nerc.ac.uk/about/consult/bas-noc-merger-consultation.pdf\" title=\"NERC BAS/NOC merger consultation document\">NERC argues this would help achieve synergies between polar and ocean research and save money in the process</a>. The idea would be to create a new institution to be called the NERC Centre for Marine and Polar Science, doing away with the 50 year-old British Antarctic Survey name.</p> <p>NERC and ministers are making reassuring noises as to their commitment to polar research, and to retaining a strong British presence in Antarctica, but senior figures at BAS fear the loss of the name and shift of headquarters is the first step toward bigger changes that will endanger the British capability to continue with properly supported scientific research on the southern continent.</p> <p>In the wake of shocking changes taking place in the Arctic, <a href=\"http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews\" title=\"National Snow and Ice Data Center\">including record sea ice melting</a>, it is surely wise to retain Arctic and Antarctic research as an unambiguous national priority. The polar regions may be far away, but they have the potential to directly affect us in the UK. A study published earlier this year suggested that the cold winters we have seen recently in the UK and elsewhere may be <a href=\"http://e360.yale.edu/feature/linking_weird_weather_to_rapid_warming_of_the_arctic/2501/\" title=\"Linking weird weather to rapid warming of the Arctic\">directly linked to the melting of Arctic sea ice</a>.</p> <p>More worrying is the west Antarctic ice sheet, which is suspected to be dangerously unstable and which could lead to more than three meters of sea level rise (at an unknown rate) if it collapsed</p> <p>It is sobering to note that the Thames barrier is built to cope with just a 16cm rise in sea level over the next 20 years. The research at Lake Ellsworth will help us assess the risk, and given the stakes retaining a world-respected, world-renowned and high-profile organization is surely a huge asset.</p> <p>Ministers and NERC need to stand back, take the longer view and do what is obviously the right thing: keep the British Antarctic Survey intact, keep it properly funded, and keep it in Cambridge.</p> <p><em>Tony Juniper is an environmental campaigner</em></p>",
  "<p>A row has broken out over the fate of one of the country's most distinguished scientific organisations, the <a href=\"http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">British Antarctic Survey</a>. The 60-year-old outfit, whose achievements have included the discovery of the hole in the ozone layer, is to be merged with the <a href=\"http://www.noc.soton.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">National Oceanography Centre</a> in Southampton as part of a cost-saving exercise.</p> <p>But the downgrade threat has outraged scientists and politicians who say it will seriously weaken Britain's scientific reputation and its ability to carry out climate research. \"This is utterly foolish,\" said Tory MP Andrew Rosindell, chairman of the polar regions cross-party parliamentary group. \"This will destabilise the work of polar scientists at a time when important climatic changes at the poles need to be investigated. My group will be calling on the government to stop this merger. This is an attempt to trash an important scientific organisation.\"</p> <p>Jonathan Shanklin, one of the scientists who discovered the gap in the ozone layer in 1985, said: \"The British Antarctic Survey is almost synonymous with the Antarctic ozone hole. Losing it would create a comparable hole in British science.\"</p> <p>The merger \u2013 which would create a Centre for Ocean and Polar Science based in Southampton \u2013 has been proposed to satisfy government demands for major cuts to be made in the budget of the <a href=\"http://www.nerc.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Natural Environment Research Council</a> (NERC), which funds the BAS. Science minister David Willetts wants a 10% cut in NERC expenditure and a 45% reduction in its capital spending by 2015. Polar research, which is costly, has been chosen to take a major hit.</p> <p>But the prospect of reducing polar research when Arctic sea ice coverage has dropped to its lowest summer level and parts of Antarctica are also showing signs of dangerous melting has been greeted with dismay. \"BAS is a terrific world-leading organisation, tightly operated, and staffed by first-rate scientists,\" said a UK climate scientist. \"Sadly, it does not seem to be highly regarded by its parent body, NERC.\"</p> <p>The organisation's director, Nick Owens, and its deputy director, Robert Culshaw, have left the survey since the merger was announced, so consultations are being run by the staff of the National Oceanography Centre.</p> <p>\"The fact that the survey's director and deputy director have left and that consultations are being run from Southampton, where the survey will be moved, has sent morale plummeting among BAS staff,\" said another BAS scientist. Ed Hill, the Antarctic survey's interim director, said the merger would not lead to the closure of the BAS's Cambridge building.</p> <p>\"Both marine and polar science need similar operational support, for example for sea vessels, and it makes sense to combine these,\" he added. \"However, I cannot say there will be no reduction in numbers of BAS scientists \u2013 though any cuts that are made will follow from overall cuts to our budgets and will not be caused by the merger.\"</p> <p>Most scientists remain scathing about the proposal, however. \"This plan reveals the current government's apparent disregard for the broad benefits of an increased understanding of the Earth,\" said Bob Ward, of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change. \"If the government wants to ensure the future prosperity and wellbeing of the UK, it needs to invest more, not less, in our world-class scientific organisations like the British Antarctic Survey.\"</p> <p>The environment campaigner Tony Juniper added: \"Ministers and NERC need to take the longer view and do the right thing: keep the British Antarctic Survey intact, keep it properly funded, and keep it in Cambridge, in the world-leading research cluster in which it is embedded.\"</p>",
  "<p>In the early 1980s British meteorologist Joe Farman, based at the British Antarctic Survey, was studying measurements of ozone levels in the stratosphere. The gas, which protects Earth from deadly solar ultraviolet radiation, had been surveyed by instruments at the BAS's Halley base in the Antarctic since 1957 to improve our understanding of polar meteorology.</p> <p>But Farman and his colleagues, Brian Gardiner and Jonathan Shanklin, stumbled on something far more important than data about weather fronts. Their measurements revealed that Earth's ozone layer had decreased by 40% between 1975 and 1984. An ozone hole was opening up over the southern hemisphere, threatening to allow ultraviolet radiation to reach the Earth and trigger epidemics of skin cancers.</p> <p>The discovery caused consternation and eventually led to the signing of the Montreal protocol, which limited the manufacture of CFC gases that are used in refrigerators and other devices and which had been shown to be the cause of the ozone hole. That hole still looms over the Antarctic but is expected to recover thanks to the Montreal agreement \u2013 though not until 2080.</p> <p>The story is important for many reasons, but is particularly relevant today because it shows how crucial research carried out at the poles is, and how important the BAS has been in these endeavours. It also explains the range and volume of the horrified responses that have greeted the plan now being prepared to curtail the BAS's independence, a consequence of its merger with the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton.</p> <p>As Andrew Rosindell, chairman of the polar regions all-party parliamentary group, has put it: \"This will destabilise the work of UK polar scientists at a time when important climatic changes are occurring at the poles and need investigation. This is an attempt to trash an extremely important scientific organisation.\"</p> <p>Many other researchers, politicians and climate activists have made it clear that they also oppose the merger \u2013 a move implemented by the BAS's paymasters, the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), because it, in turn, is being cut back by the coalition government as part of its plan to reduce investment in science. And here the story of the discovery of the ozone hole provides an extra twist to proceedings.</p> <p>In the early 1980s UK science was being squeezed by Margaret Thatcher's government and long-term monitoring programmes were considered to be particularly vulnerable, including the ozone project at Halley. As Shanklin has said: \"Our monitoring was in the frame. Nothing seemed to be changing and there seemed little reason to keep it going.\"</p> <p>The axe was about to fall when the three scientists published news of their discovery of the ozone hole in <em>Nature</em> in 1985. Overnight their work changed from being a drain on resources to being a world leader and a triumph for British science. The project, and the planet, were saved.</p> <p>Sadly, we seem to have learned little in the intervening decades. The coalition government of David Cameron \u2013 which pledged to lead \"the greenest government ever\" \u2013 has demanded a massive reduction in environmental research as part of an overall plan to reduce annual public investment in science by 14%. As Bob Ward of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change points out: \"Basic research, which is driven by the quest for new knowledge rather than an immediately identifiable application, is again under threat as part of the coalition government's programme to reduce its investment in science.\"</p> <p>The crucial word, of course, is threat. No one has yet closed down any BAS projects. But the risk is real; both the director and deputy director have already left their posts since the merger plan was announced and signs indicate a serious loss of morale. Senior scientists are unlikely to hang about at an institution that appears to be so ill-regarded by its controllers at the NERC and by the government. In such a situation, the next generation of Farmans, Gardiners and Shanklins \u2013 researchers who could pinpoint future risks to the planet \u2013 will not be on hand to do work that could have crucial environmental importance.</p> <p>And this is a key point. The impact of global warming is being felt first at the poles. This year summer sea-ice levels in the Arctic plunged to a record low and there is every sign that equally profound changes are taking place in the Antarctic, though it is a far more complex terrain to comprehend than its northern counterpart. Yet the government is inflicting cuts that will prevent Britain playing a proper role in such investigations, say critics who point out that, more than any other country, the UK has helped open up the Antarctic to scientific study. James Cook was the first person to cross the Antarctic Circle; James Clark Ross was the first to reach the continent's great ice shelves; Scott and Shackleton's expeditions in the early 20th century were triumphs of scientific endeavour, even though Scott was beaten to the south pole by Roald Amundsen in 1912; and the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1955-58, led by the British explorer Vivian Fuchs, was the first to cross the continent overland.</p> <p>It is an impressive legacy. Just how long Britain can continue to add to it with new research remains to be seen. Certainly the prospects of us continuing to do world-leading science there are looking a bit stressed at present.</p>",
  "<p>The Obama administration has wound up its controversial investigation of a government polar bear researcher without finding any evidence of scientific wrongdoing, campaign groups said late Friday.</p> <p>However, the scientist, Charles Monnett, who was the first to draw attention to the dangers to polar bears in a warming Arctic, was reprimanded for forwarding official email to a local government official and a fellow researcher at the University of Alaska without prior authorisation.</p> <p>Campaign groups described the findings as a victory for Monnett, who until last year oversaw much of the government's scientific work in the Arctic. It was also an embarrassment for the Obama administration, whose two-and-a-half-year investigation uncovered no evidence of major wrongdoing.</p> <p>\"This has been a vindication of Dr Monnett in that they found no scientific misconduct or anything related to his scientific work that merited any sort of discipline or personnel action,\" said Jeff Ruch, director of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, which had led the defence of Monnett.</p> <p>But he said the official reprimand, though minor in terms of disciplinary action, was sobering. \"It reads as if it was motivated by attempts during the Obama years to clog leaks and root out environmental dissidents inside the department of interior having to do with Arctic drilling.\"</p> <p>Until mid-2011, Monnett oversaw much of the research on Arctic wildlife, managing $50m in scientific projects, for the government agency overseeing oil drilling in Alaska, the bureau of ocean energy management, or BOEM.</p> <p>Peer said Monnett was told informally on Thursday he could return to his scientific role.</p> <p>The reprimand will be expunged from his record in two years or less, <a href=\"http://www.peer.org/docs/noaa/10_1_12_Monnett_reprimand.pdf\">the interior department said in a letter to Monnett</a>.</p> <p>The wildlife biologist was suspended for six weeks last year and subsequently sidelined as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/28/arctic-scientist-polar-bear-oil\">interior department's inspector general investigated charges of scientific misconduct</a> and mismanagement of government contracts.</p> <p>The investigation was launched in March 2010 just as Obama announced he would open up the Arctic to offshore drilling and expand oil exploration in the Gulf of Mexico.</p> <p>The investigators began their inquiries by examining allegations that Monnett and another scientist had used false data in an article on drowned polar bears.</p> <p>The scientists wrote the article after a research flight in 2004 during which they observed four drowned polar bears. In the article for Polar Biology, Monnett concluded the bears, though usually strong swimmers, had become exhausted during the long distances between patches of solid sea ice.</p> <p>The research note was the first time scientists had drawn a link between melting Arctic sea ice and a threat to the bears' survival, and was immediately taken up by Al Gore and other environmental campaigners. In 2008 the polar bear was listed as an endangered species because of climate change and melting sea ice.</p> <p>The inspector general's report found flaws in the work, but no major issues of scientific integrity.</p> <p>The investigation then examined whether Monnett had improperly awarded research contracts.</p> <p>In the end, the department decided to take action only on Monnett's unauthorised release of government documents on five separate occasions in 2007 and 2008. \"I consider your misconduct very serious, \" the deputy director of BOEM, Walter Cruikshank, wrote in the letter to Monnett.</p> <p>Some of the material disclosed by Monnett was later used in court to force the interior department to revoke its approval of Shell's drilling plan, the letter said.</p> <p>Arctic researchers and environmental campaigns saw the investigation of Monnett as an attempt to discredit or sideline government scientists \u2013 and so clear the way for Shell and other oil companies seeking approval to begin drilling in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas.</p> <p>Shell began drilling its first offshore well in the Chukchi this month but was forced to pull out because of a series of problems in its oil containment system.</p> <p>\"It was a witch hunt. They were looking for anything they could find on Chuck (Monnett) to try to get rid of him or at least try to discredit him,\" said Richard Steiner, who was the receipient of four of the five unauthorised email releases.</p> <p>Rebecca Noblin, who heads the Arctic programme for the Centre for Biological Diversity agreed. \"After years of dredging through Dr Monnett's files looking for damning evidence against the scientist, all the inspector general could come up with is that Dr Monnett disclosed documents that should have been public in the first place,\" she said in an email. \"If there were more people like Dr Monnett in BOEM, maybe we'd see more drilling decisions based on science rather than politics.\"</p>",

  "<p>For the past five days, 1,000 female Nigerian pilgrims have been detained at an airport and various detention facilities in Saudi Arabia. They arrived in the country to conduct the annual pilgrimage, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj\" title=\"\">the hajj</a>, a duty that every Muslim must fulfil once in their lifetime if they can afford to do so. Despite the fact that they had valid hajj visas, Saudi authorities would not allow them into the country as they were unaccompanied by male guardians (<em>mahrams</em>). While about 200 have already been sent back, the rest remain, awaiting a resolution of the matter between the Nigerian and Saudi governments.</p> <p>The issue has precipitated a <a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/201209270091.html\" title=\"\">diplomatic spat</a> between the two countries. A spokesman for the Nigerian vice-presidential office said he had received reports that the women were being subjected to \"dehumanising treatment\", being deprived of food and forced to sleep on cold floors. Paradoxically, and hypocritically, the women are being subjected to the very dishonour that a male guardian is allegedly required to protect them against.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia prides itself on being \"the custodian of the two holy mosques\". Every year, the country hosts up to 3 million pilgrims as they perform the holy rite. It is a political and logistical feat, and Saudi Arabia has invested heavily in hajj infrastructure. However, the hajj is blighted with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidents_during_the_Hajj\" title=\"\">practical and logistical failures</a>. And female pilgrims are often disproportionately affected, as they fall foul of arbitrary legal innovations and immigration disarray.</p> <p>While the mahram requirement is notoriously well known, its application has been erratic. Female members of my family were sent back for not having a mahram as far back as the 1980s, but since then it has been common for women to be allowed to travel in convoys, sponsored by their diplomatic missions or equivalent authority. It seems that Saudis themselves admit that this is a new enforcement of the letter of the law: the Saudi ambassador in Abuja said that they had been \"flexible in the past\", but had decided to apply the law this time. To add to the humiliation, the implication that these women are not complying with religious law (of which Saudis believe their interpretation is the only arbiter) is insulting in the extreme: to want to complete the hajj at all (not to mention incurring the significant costs and physical hardship) would suggest a certain level of committed religious observance. In addition, the mahram rule is applied in its current extreme form only in Saudi Arabia. It is by no means a universal Islamic stipulation that other Muslims with <a href=\"http://abubakrsiddeeq.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/women-can-perform-hajj-without-mahram.html\" title=\"\">different religious cultures</a> would adopt, especially on a hajj trip lasting three days.</p> <p>It is not the first time that female pilgrims have fallen victim to Saudi Arabia's random legislation. Last year, based on some internalised cultural stereotype, <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.net/news/pages/0e5fc167-3ee3-457d-88ae-a719ced1f839\" title=\"\">Saudis banned Moroccan women</a> of a certain age from the <em>umrah</em>, a shorter pilgrimage, even if they were accompanied by mahrams, because of a belief <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/aug/29/saudi-arabia-ban-moroccan-women-stereotype\" title=\"\">that they were of loose morals</a> and would somehow slip through the (very tight noose) of the umrah visa and entice Saudi men into underground prostitution rings.</p> <p>Both incidents reek of national and racial discrimination. Nigerian officials claim that only Nigerian women were screened and subjected to such treatment. Unfortunately, in a region where there is sensitivity about the treatment of black Muslims \u2013 the term <em>abda</em> (slave) is one I heard often while living there \u2013 the cordoning off and manhandling of hundreds of black Muslim women looks very bad.</p> <p>As the kingdom deported several thousand Nigerian overstayers last year, the mahram issue may well be a ham-fisted cover for a pre-emptive crackdown on immigration. Though it is perfectly within the kingdom's rights to apply entry conditions, it is unreasonable to do it under false pretences.</p> <p>Whether it is the result of clumsy instruction from above or airport officials acting stubbornly and forcing the government to back them, the incident and the scores of angry women arriving in Nigeria and venting their ire to international media are an embarrassment to the Saudis at the beginning of hajj season.</p>",
  "<p>For months the chatter in Labour circles has been \"it's too good to be true\". The polls may say the party is 10 points ahead, but Labour strategists convince themselves the lead is \"soft\" and the path to electability remains daunting.</p> <p>But is Labour's lead really that soft? To get to the bottom of this question, the Fabian Society looked at how many people say they are certain to vote Labour. The answer suggests a Labour majority is now the most likely outcome at the 2015 election.</p> <p>Today, according to YouGov polling, about 8.5 million people say the chances they will consider Labour at the next election are 10-out-of-10, while to win a majority Labour will need something like 11m votes. So Ed Miliband needs to find in the region of 2.5m votes from people who say their minds are not totally made up.</p> <p>David Cameron's challenge is much greater: he has to find an extra 4.5m votes. This is because today there are one million fewer people who are \"10-out-of-10\" Conservative voters, while the quirks of our electoral system mean Cameron needs at least one million votes more than Miliband to win a majority.</p> <p>To get a feel for where these missing votes might come from, we looked at people who say their chance of considering each party is between five and nine out of 10. Again, Labour has far more of these \"possible\" voters than the Conservatives \u2013 14m compared with 10m. So Miliband not only needs to win fewer votes from among his waverers, he is also fishing in a bigger pool. Assuming for a moment that all the \"10-out-of-10\" supporters vote, in 2015 Miliband will need less than 20% of the Labour \"possibles\", while Cameron will need almost half the Tory equivalent.</p> <p>Of course, these numbers are based on mid-term polls and an awful lot could happen in the next two years. The Lib Dems might change leader, with a \"Vince bounce\" seeing the party claw back support from Labour. The Conservatives could stage a successful assault on Labour with an election campaign focused on the deficit, immigration, Europe, welfare and Miliband's readiness for power.</p> <p>The point is that Labour has a strong cushion, which gives the party space to slip some way before the chance of a majority recedes. Even a really big jump in both Conservative and Lib Dem support would still leave Labour the largest party, just short of an outright majority.</p> <p>Labour is also relatively immune to losing support directly to the Conservatives. Today, it is riding high in the polls despite having won over few of David Cameron's 2010 voters, while only six million of Labour's 22 million potential supporters are considering voting Tory. Most of Cameron's target voters currently support Ukip, the Lib Dems or are sitting on their hands. This means Labour can withstand a Tory resurgence as long as it is able to hang on to plenty of former Lib Dems and persuade some sympathisers who did not vote in 2010 to cast their ballot next time.</p> <p>Chasing lots of Conservative voters by tacking to the right is unwise as well as unnecessary. It risks alienating recent Labour converts such as left-leaning Lib Dems and others disaffected during the New Labour years. Indeed, Fabian analysis shows that Labour supporters today are no less leftwing than they were in 2010, even though there are so many more of them. The tectonic plates of British politics have shifted and the make-or-break voters who will decide the next election are now further to the left than in the New Labour era.</p> <p>So what does this mean for Ed Miliband's pitch to the public? Despite the strong numbers, Labour cannot afford to be complacent. The party will struggle if it sits back and presents itself as an empty vessel for people's discontentment with a shambolic government. Following this course might well be enough for Labour to become the largest party in parliament, but not to win a convincing majority. Miliband must remember that unless Labour defines itself, it will offer a blank canvass for the Conservatives to define the party in the worst possible light.</p> <p>His priority must be to inspire people who are looking for reasons to vote Labour with a positive alternative and purposeful leadership. In the year ahead, Labour must set out a handful of big, signature proposals that exemplify how and why it would govern, what marks it out from the coalition and how people's lives would change.</p> <p>Miliband's model must be 1945 or 1979, when the winning party entered the election with a strong and clear alternative which captured the public zeitgeist and heralded a rupture from the past. Making big promises may feel risky, but it also shows substance and decisiveness. These are the qualities which need to register with the millions of people looking for reasons to back Labour.</p>",
  "<p>Anti-ceasefire republicans have stolen up to 30 high-powered rifles with telescopic sights that can be used in sniper attacks against the security forces in Northern Ireland, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>The theft of the long-range rifles has raised the spectre of a new lethal sniper campaign similar to the one the South Armagh Provisional IRA conducted that resulted in the deaths of several soldiers and policemen in the 1990s.</p> <p>A security operation is still ongoing in the Irish Republic to track down the weapons, which can hit a target from over half a mile away and are normally used to shoot deer.</p> <p>In 1997, British soldier Lance Bombardier Stephen Restorick died after being hit by a high velocity bullet fired from a sniper's rifle near the border with the Republic.</p> <p>The Garda Sioch\u00e1na has confirmed that their officers in County Wicklow are investigating the theft of firearms during a break-in at a gun dealer's premises in Ashford on 8 September.</p> <p>The Guardian has learned that up to 30 rifles with telescopic sights may have been taken in a highly organised robbery at the gun shop in the town. It is understood only two of the weapons taken have been recovered so far.</p> <p>Security sources in Northern Ireland say the gang behind the break-in was organised by a terror unit controlled by the late Real IRA commander in Dublin, Alan Ryan.</p> <p>He was shot dead in the same month following a dispute with armed non-political criminals in the Irish capital.</p> <p>They say the fact that almost all of the weapons are still at large is causing a major security headache on both sides of the Irish border. The guns have been handed over to a new self-styled IRA which is an amalgam of the Real IRA, Republican Action Against Drugs and various armed dissident republican units in Tyrone, Derry, Armagh and Antrim, the security forces say.</p> <p>In the Republic, Garda sources are linking raids over the last fortnight in the greater Dublin area to a desperate attempt to recover the rifles before they are smuggled across the border.</p> <p>The two guns that have been recovered were found in north Dublin a fortnight ago during a \"tailing\" operation directed at associates of Alan Ryan who have vowed to take revenge against the Dublin crime gang behind his murder.</p> <p>However, it is not expected that the long-range rifles would be used in the continuing feud between republican dissidents in Dublin and one of the city's most notorious group of gangsters.</p> <p>One man was arrested in connection with the robbery of the rifles and released after questioning. A file is being prepared for the Republic's Director of Public Prosecutions.</p> <p>Police believe the gang who broke into the shop at the Coolawinna Business Park used an electronic jamming device to disable an alarm signal from the shed used to house the business.</p> <p>Gun dealers throughout the Irish Republic are being contacted to ensure that their premises are secure.</p> <p>However, most gun dealers use conventional \"dual-com\" alarm systems which use landline telephone and GSM back-up phone signals. The robbers of the Wicklow gun dealer cut the phone line and jammed the GSM signal with the electronic blocker.</p> <p>In the past organisations such as the Real IRA have tried to smuggle in such high-powered rifles from dealers in eastern Europe but their last attempt to buy weapons in Lithuania was thwarted and two men were arrested following a \"sting\" operation involving the British secret security services.</p> <p>It is believed the dissidents have now opted for the \"safer\" option of stealing the high-powered hunting rifles, which are almost compatible with military rifles, from the legitimate Irish dealers.</p> <p>A car used in the robbery is believed to have been stolen from south Dublin in the weeks before the robbery.</p> <p>Asked about the theft of the weapons, a spokesman at Garda headquarters in Dublin said the break-in happened between 12.45am and 2.35am.</p> <p>\"It is believed at least five people were involved in the burglary, in which a number of firearms were stolen. The scene was preserved for a Garda technical examination.\"</p> <p>He said a car was stopped three days later in Dublin. \"During the course of the search Garda\u00ed discovered two firearms which had been reported stolen.\"</p> <p>A 26-year-old man was arrested and investigations were continuing to establish if the firearms were taken during the burglary.</p> <p>The Garda press office did not confirm or deny whether other weapons were still missing, or specify the number that had been stolen.</p>"
