  "<p>In 2005, Lydia Cacho was approached by several police officers. They bundled her into a van and for the 20 hours it took to drive from Cancun in southern Mexico, where she lives, north to the city of Puebla she was, she says, \"tortured\". Sexual assault was threatened. A gun was pushed into her mouth. A sickening see-saw: \"I kept thinking one minute I was going to die, then that I would survive.\"</p> <p>When they arrived, a female guard told her she would be raped in jail. In fact, a network of friends, contacts and activists swung into action and she was bailed. Attempts on her life continued, and she has become well known as one of Mexico's bravest journalists. A recent estimate put the number killed there since 2006 at 67. Amid this, Cacho started work on her next book.</p> <p>This story tells you several things about Cacho and the world she works in: alleged corruption (tapes surfaced that appeared to show her arrest was orchestrated by a man she had written about, alleging he had connections to a paedophile ring), the vulnerability of Mexico's journalists, and that Cacho is not somebody who can be silenced. Her new book, Slavery Inc: the Untold Story of International Sex Trafficking, is about to be published in the UK. Although she has lived with death threats for years, she took the most recent one four weeks ago seriously enough to leave the country.</p> <p>On 29 July, she received a call on her satellite radio from a man who told her she was a \"fucking bitch\" who had ignored their warnings, concluding: \"We are going to send you home in pieces.\" \"The way they interfered with my radio, it had to be someone who had the power and the means,\" she says. \"Immediately I called some security experts, one here in London, and told them. They said to get out of the house immediately. I&#xa0;called my lawyers and they said the same thing, so I did. I just took my passport and a bag and got out of there.\"</p> <p>Is Cacho frightened? If the question is obvious, the answer isn't. She sits across the table in an office in central London, utterly composed, an occasional flicker of rage behind dark eyes. \"I think it's absurd,\" she says. \"I'm telling the truth, I'm a good journalist and I have to flee my country.\" Later she says: \"I don't scare easily.\" She has been offered asylum in several countries \u2013 not just on this occasion, but in the past \u2013 but has never wanted to take it. \"I like my country. [In Mexico] really good journalists are so badly needed. It's important. I&#xa0;want to be there to see the change.\"</p> <p>Is she prepared for how long she might have to stay away? A deep sigh. \"I want to go back home, everything is there \u2013 my house, my dogs. I'm trying to find out who did it and expose them, which is the only thing I can do to save my life.\" She thinks this threat is related to her book, in which she names men who she says are involved in sex trafficking in Mexico.</p> <p>She travels to some of the world's sex tourism centres to piece together her story on the thriving global sex trade, much of it told through the testimonies of women and children. She met children rescued from sex slavery in Cambodia and Guatemala. A North American woman who told her how her \"employers\" \u2013 she thought she would be working as a singer in a nightclub \u2013 confiscated her visa and plane ticket and over several days kept her prisoner in a hotel room where she was drugged and raped by dozens of men. A woman from Venezuela, who escaped her traffickers in Mexico, was able to identify numerous immigration officials either as clients or those who had facilitated the passage of girls flown into the country. Dressed as a nun in Mexico City \u2013 the only safe way, she decided, for a woman to walk its mafia-controlled areas \u2013 Cacho saw children working as prostitutes in motels.</p> <p>Finding figures for the number of people trafficked and enslaved is notoriously difficult; in 2005, the International Labour Organisation said 2.4 million at any one time are trafficked into forced labour, with at least 43% of these forced to work in the sex industry, but it's a conservative estimate. \"The point of the&#xa0;book was to understand how the international markets are connected,\" she says. \"As a reporter, I was really frustrated, because every time I&#xa0;interviewed an expert, everyone kept telling me they're not linked, that this isn't an international business. But it is.\"</p> <p>She was threatened throughout her research. \"In Bangkok, I stayed in very nice hotels because it was the way to see the rich European clients who bring girls or boys to the hotel. I would be sitting in the bar, and have my camera with me, and someone would always come over, a&#xa0;waiter, saying, 'Be careful, don't do that, you're a journalist, right?' In Cambodia, I had to flee a casino and hide in my hotel.\" She tried to barricade herself into her room with furniture. \"I thought it was clever.\" She laughs. \"And then I thought: 'This is stupid, they have guns and I just have a chair against the door.'\"</p> <p>Before she started the investigation, Cacho says she was open to the idea of legalising and regulating prostitution, and had listened to many academics and feminists who advocated it. \"Then the more I travelled, and the more women I&#xa0;interviewed, the more worried I got,\" she says. \"I'm absolutely convinced that all forms of prostitution are just a way of normalising gender discrimination and violence against women, and women are 'trained' to become prostitutes because they are objects in a society that&#xa0;wants to have ghettoes of women who can be raped.\"</p> <p>She adds she doesn't really believe women can \"choose\" to become a prostitute: \"In order to make a choice, you really need to have opportunities and options. If you don't, you are not really choosing, you are just getting by.\" She says there isn't just the stereotypical idea of children and women who are abducted and enslaved (though these do, of course, exist); there are the women who are duped and find themselves owing thousands of dollars to the men who control them. Women, Cacho writes, who \"have been conditioned to sell their bodies, and believe prostitution is the only way for them to make a living\". In Cambodia, Cacho met a woman who runs a brothel who explained how she \"reprograms\" girls by \"normalising sexual exploitation through systematic exposure to pornography. They have to be convinced that they were the ones who chose to do this, and&#xa0;they must be constantly reminded that their lives are worth nothing.\"</p> <p>Even the women she met who were earning thousands of dollars, seemingly free to leave when they wanted, didn't convince her that sex work could be a rational and free labour choice. \"After a while, when you get in depth in an interview, they start telling you how miserable they are, how they are mistreated by clients, how they hate the&#xa0;smell of them, or the way the clients behave. They start giving you little stories that are stories of violence.\"</p> <p>She tries to knit together the links that stretch across the world. She met the former wife of a drug trafficker who described how young women were first exploited as prostitutes, then forced to work in their factories making illegal drugs, and how contacts were met in London, and were formed with gangs in&#xa0;Mexico and Cuba. Police in different countries have told her how many police, politicians and the judiciary are clients of brothels run by organised criminals. The tangle she portrays is overwhelming. The sex trade is growing, she says, in part \"because politicians all&#xa0;over the world are not addressing poverty. They are not really improving the lives of women and girls.\"</p> <p>One reason for the growth of pornography and prostitution, Cacho believes, is that while women's rights are improving in many places, \"the culture of masculinity has not changed at all\". The fact that there are men, she points out, from Europe and North America, who \"go to Mexico, Venezuela, Cambodia, Thailand to have sex with women there is telling you something\". She remembers a young man in Spain who explained he used prostitutes because he couldn't be bothered to talk to the women he met in&#xa0;his everyday life as equals. What she would love to see, she writes, is a \"new masculine revolution \u2026 a new generation of men, not warriors, not armed, not threatening divine punishment, not violent, but men who possess a strong sense of progress and justice\".</p> <p>Cacho was born into a large family in Mexico City. Her father was an engineer, her French mother a psychologist who was involved in the feminist movement. \"They way she saw the world was really enlightening for me,\" she says. \"It was shocking to live in a house in which equality was really implemented every day with my brothers and sisters, and then go out in to a country that didn't respect the rights of women.\"</p> <p>At 23, she became a reporter, and started writing about violence against women. \"My editor said, 'This is good, stick to that.' I thought, yes, this is what I like doing.\" In 1999, a man followed her into the bathroom of a bus station in Cancun and inflicted a brutal attack, in which she was raped and had several bones broken \u2013 an attack, she believes, that was \"punishment\" for her work.</p> <p>And so the threats continued, especially once she started trying to expose a paedophile ring in Cancun for her previous book, Demons of Eden (one of the men she wrote about, Jean Succar Kuri, was sentenced last year). For a time, she travelled in an armoured car and had federal bodyguards; she dispensed with them three years ago after her car was sabotaged. \"I lost a lot of friends and I&#xa0;respected that \u2013 they said they didn't want to be seen with me in public. My social life changed dramatically. You learn how to walk the&#xa0;street and be looking all the time for&#xa0;signs of somebody coming, like a&#xa0;motorcycle.\"</p> <p>The psychological toll is alleviated with therapy, yoga, and \u2013 until now \u2013 spending time in her garden with her dogs, \"getting in touch with the earth, life. I have a sense of humour. A lot of people think I'm weird because I can laugh about the worst things that happen \u2013 not when they're happening, but afterwards. I think that's healthy. You get cynical if you can't laugh.\"</p> <p>The risks are real. In April, her friend, the Mexican investigative journalist Regina Martinez, was killed. Anna Politkovskaya was also a friend; Cacho recalls they met two months before the&#xa0;Russian journalist was murdered in&#xa0;2006. She searches for the words: \"Reality. Shock.\"</p> <p>The only thing to do is to keep working. (She can't stop \u2013 yesterday, she says, she was in her hotel room forwarding a Facebook page she believes is used by a paedophile ring to Interpol.) As well as her writing, she has founded a women's shelter in Cancun; last year, it provided refuge or psychological and legal help to 30,000 women fleeing abuse. Cacho never wanted to become the story, but&#xa0;the threats on her life also bring a spotlight to her work, and to the dangers faced by her colleagues. \"I've never wanted a quiet life, otherwise I wouldn't be a reporter or an activist,\" she says.</p> <p>\"Of course, I get fed up with the politics and the corruption, but I never question my work. We are journalists because we want to change the world.\" She smiles. \"I think my job has made a&#xa0;difference.\"</p> <p><em>Slavery Inc: the Untold Story of International Sex Trafficking by Lydia Cacho is published on 6 September by Portobello Books, priced \u00a314.99.

  "<h2>Wild Oats, Bristol</h2> <p>The Old Vic, that exquisite and most gracious of theatres, has been lovingly restored and re-opens with comfortable new seats, improved sightlines and a flexible thrust stage. Over the past 12 months the building has been stripped right back to reveal 19th-century graffiti and sweet wrappers from a century ago, and refashioned to create a modern theatre that still retains its old charm. Christening the space is John O'Keeffe's 18th-century comic caper, a play about acting and identity dating, like the theatre itself, from the Georgian era. It focuses on the quick-witted actor, Jack Rover, a man who can assume a new identity without thinking, but who has some difficulty in keeping hold of his own character.</p> <p><strong><em>Bristol Old Vic, Tue to 20 Oct</em></strong></p> <p><em>Lyn Gardner</em></p> <h2>The Judas Kiss, London</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395471224\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/31/1346407856650/Rupert-Everett-and-Freddi-008.jpg\" alt=\"Rupert Everett and Freddie Fox\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rupert Everett and Freddie Fox.

As the scope of his work has tightened \u2013 from the sprawling ensembles of <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/34488/boogie-nights\">Boogie Nights</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/81820/magnolia\">Magnolia</a></strong> through the intimate duologue of <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/94083/punch-drunk-love\">Punch-Drunk Love</a></strong> to the all-consuming solipsism of <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/122167/there.will.be.blood\">There Will Be Blood</a></strong> \u2013 so his dedication to his craft has intensified, with his disdain for PR and celebrity marking him out as the most devout film-maker of his generation (as well as the owner of one of Wikipedia's most glitz-free \"personal life\" sections). His upcoming film <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/146341/master\">The Master</a></strong>, a controversial look at the birth of a cult not entirely dissimilar to the Church of Scientology, should make that title inarguable.</p> <h2><strong>2 - Lynne Ramsay</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395475768\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/29/1346244943089/Tilda-Swinton-in-We-Need--008.jpg\" alt=\"Tilda Swinton in We Need To Talk About Kevin\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tilda Swinton in We Need To Talk About Kevin.

Kevin was a heavenly marriage of the source material and its Glaswegian director's long-running preoccupations (kids, death, guilt), allied to her startling, hypnotic visual sense. Making her feature debut with 1999's hauntingly beautiful <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/79578/ratcatcher\">Ratcatcher</a></strong> (although a clutch of award-winning shorts preceded it), she's remained a critical darling ever since.

Refn has made only nine films in 15 years but the end product is as singular as it is stunning. Refn's films look like nobody else's (although, admittedly, 2009's <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/132559/valhalla-rising\">Valhalla Rising</a></strong> was pretty Malick-like). From his brutal <strong>Pusher</strong> trilogy to the weird and wonderful anti-biopic <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/126512/bronson\">Bronson</a></strong>, these films are more like art installations, shimmering with stylish violence and near-hallucinatory moments. Last year's <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142036/drive\">Drive</a></strong> suddenly made a whole lot of people remember his name, however. His next two projects also star Ryan Gosling: Thai boxing film <strong>Only God Forgives</strong>, and a remake of carousel-based 70s sci-fi <strong>Logan's Run</strong>. They will soon be sick of the sight of each other.</p> <h2><strong>4 - Joss Whedon</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395475770\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/29/1346245207782/Chris-Hemsworth-and-Chris-008.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans in Avengers Assemble\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans in Avengers Assemble.

Since then, Whedon has pulled off the rare trick of turning niche popularity into blockbuster success, with films that appease fanboys and fangirls alike while maintaining serious box-office traction. This year, Whedon pulled off a rare one-two by delivering not just one of the year's biggest hits \u2013 Marvel's <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/144027/avengers\">Avengers Assemble</a></strong> \u2013 but one of its best-reviewed counter-programming titles, the postmodern horror-comedy <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/146753/cabin-in-the-woods\">The Cabin In The Woods</a></strong>, which he wrote and produced. Though <strong>Avengers 2</strong> is pencilled in for 2015, his micro-budget B&amp;W <strong><a href=\"http://muchadothemovie.com/\">Much Ado About Nothing</a></strong> adaptation, shot in his own house in eight days and starring Whedon favourites, is due first.</p> <h2><strong>5 - Lars Von Trier</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395475771\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/29/1346245432579/Kirsten-Dunst-in-Melancho-008.jpg\" alt=\"Kirsten Dunst in Melancholia\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kirsten Dunst in Melancholia.

In the past 10 years alone, he's turned out a nightmare-fuelling psychological horror, a shattering arthouse disaster movie, a fluffy Danish office comedy, an experimental documentary on the nature of creative endeavour and the first two parts of a trilogy about American culpability. His next project, <strong>The Nymphomaniac</strong>, is set to become the first film to feature both Shia LaBeouf and graphic scenes of unsimulated sex. No other director can straddle the arthouse/Hollywood divide with such audacity.</p> <h2><strong>6 - Jason Reitman</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395475772\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/29/1346245529443/Charlize-Theron-in-Young--008.jpg\" alt=\"Charlize Theron in Young Adult\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charlize Theron in Young Adult.

Caruso</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hollywood nepotism is a well-documented force for evil, inflicting upon the world horrors as wide-ranging as \"rapper\" Chet Haze (son of Tom Hanks) and Jaden Smith (son of Will). So Jason Reitman, offspring of Ghostbusters director Ivan, had his work cut out when he followed his father into the family business with the independent Big Tobacco satire <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/112704/thank.you.for.smoking\">Thank You For Smoking</a></strong>. In the seven years since, though, he's had four Oscar nominations and matured exponentially with each film, his efforts culminating in this year's devastating tragicomedy <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142806/young-adult\">Young Adult</a></strong>, which furnished Charlize Theron with a career-best role as embittered ghostwriter Mavis Gary. Next, he directs Kate Winslet in <strong>Labor Day</strong>. Ivan \"father of Jason\" Reitman, by contrast, was last seen churning out the Ashton Kutcher vehicle No Strings Attached.</p> <h2><strong>7 - Steve McQueen</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395475773\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/29/1346245664350/Michael-Fassbender-in-Sha-008.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Fassbender in Shame\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Fassbender in Shame.

What few could foresee was his talent with actors, drawing a career-defining performance from Michael Fassbender in the IRA drama <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/124579/hunger\">Hunger</a></strong> and following it with another in the sex-addiction story <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142860/shame\">Shame</a></strong>. In the flesh, McQueen is straightforward, imposing and hates pretension. His films, despite their beautifully composed tableaux, follow a similar template. His first two dealt with willpower and the lack of it, in that order, and his next \u2013 <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/jun/01/benedict-cumberbatch-twelve-years-a-slave\">12 Years A Slave</a></strong> \u2013 reunites him with Fassbender alongside Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Giamatti and one Brad Pitt. The pressure will be on but don't expect McQueen to duck the issues on another hot-button movie.</p> <h2><strong>8 - Leos Carax</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395475774\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/29/1346245750075/Edith-Scob-in-Holy-Motors-008.jpg\" alt=\"Edith Scob in Holy Motors\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Edith Scob in Holy Motors.

His two films in the 1990s, <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/83322/amants-du-pont-neuf\">Les Amants Du Pont-Neuf</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/83326/pola.x\">Pola X</a></strong>, were respectively a hit and a miss, but his new film <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/147447/holy-motors\">Holy Motors</a></strong> restored his crown as French cinema's arthouse counterpart to the mainstream Luc Besson. Often cryptic, sometimes boring, Carax nevertheless has a showman's touch, and though his films deal with navel-gazing issues \u2013 blocked artists are a recurring motif \u2013 it's hard to think of another film-maker whose work features hair-eating leprechauns, accordion blues solos and Kylie Minogue.</p> <h2><strong>9 - Edgar Wright</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395475775\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/29/1346245935982/Scott-Pilgrim-Vs-The-Worl-008.jpg\" alt=\"Scott Pilgrim Vs The World\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scott Pilgrim Vs The World</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The two men and a dog who watched late-night 90s ITV comedy Asylum will have been alerted to his talents early on, but for the rest of us it was Spaced that first introduced us to Edgar Wright, as well as collaborators Simon Pegg and Nick Frost.

  "<p>It is sometimes said that a dying patient will cling to life while family members are present, only slipping away when everybody finally leaves the room. I&#xa0;have this, but with my house.</p> <p>All year long, the house shudders along in some kind of perpetual end stage, invariably choosing the two weeks we're on holiday to give up the ghost. This is when bits of it fall off, spring leaks or grind to a halt. Upon our return, it is not always immediately apparent which vital organ has packed up.</p> <p>\"Everything looks OK,\" I say, examining the ceiling for telltale stains.</p> <p>\"Electricity's on,\" my wife says. \"Water comes out of the taps.\"</p> <p>\"Good,\" I say. \"I'm having a bath.\"</p> <p>The bath water is cold. I check to see if the boiler is off, but it's raging away. But there is a familiar whining sound emerging from the system.</p> <p>\"The central heating is broken,\" I&#xa0;tell my wife.</p> <p>\"How can it be?\" she says. \"No one has touched it.\"</p> <p>\"This happened once before, many years ago. A bit of scale has broken off inside the pipes and travelled down to the pump, where it's become lodged in the impeller.\"</p> <p>\"I don't understand.\"</p> <p>\"Think of it this way: our house has suffered a major cardiac event, and needs an expensive operation.\"</p> <p>\"I can't remember the name of the plumber who replaced our plumber,\" she says.</p> <p>The pump problem is deemed non-urgent, because my wife is leaving again almost immediately, to take the younger two to visit friends over the bank holiday weekend. I am to join them later, as soon I have completed a week's work and enjoyed a series of freezing showers.</p> <p>I arrive on Thursday night. The following morning, our host offers me a coffee. \"Sorry about the cup,\" he says. \"I had to run the dishwasher again.\"</p> <p>The youngest emerges from a bedroom. \"Dad,\" he says. \"Will you play tennis with me?\"</p> <p>\"Yes,\" I say, \"just as soon as I've...\" My phone dings in my pocket. It's a text from the oldest one, who is at a festival. It says: \"how do u put the tent up??\"</p> <p>This presents a puzzle. I packed him off with our bad tent, because I&#xa0;didn't trust him with our good tent, but I last erected the bad tent in 2007. I ring him.</p> <p>\"Peg out the floor,\" I say, \"then ring me back.\"</p> <p>By the time he rings, I am on the tennis court.</p> <p>\"OK,\" I say. \"There are, as I recall, two metal spacers that go on top of the poles between the inner tent and the flysheet.\"</p> <p>\"Nope,\" he says. \"There isn't anything like that in any of the... oh wait.

A familiar sight greets me.</p> <p>\"You're problem is simple,\" I say. \"Small bits of food have clogged the jets of both spray arms, resulting in incomplete rinsing. Pine nuts or puy lentils are usually to blame. It is a middle-class curse.\"</p> <p>An hour later we are holding sparkling wine glasses to the light.</p> <p>\"You've changed our lives,\" our host says.</p> <p>\"He's good at that sort of thing,\" my wife says with a slight stress on the <em>that</em>.</p> <p>Two days later, I'm back at home, staring at the central heating pump, having just accidentally stepped into another ice-cold bath.

Though I'd still leave the very dry, steely types for sipping, our beloved cream sherry (made by combining extra sweet with a dry type) has many uses in baking. From a simple syrup for soaking a fat baba in or spooning over fruit cakes, to using it instead of milk or water, sherry adds a gentle flavour that lends richness without being immediately detectable. The effect is subtle, so don't splash out on an expensive brand (though it's rarely <em>that</em> pricey). Rather, view this as a chance to make more from a neglected wine.</p> <h2>Sherry raisin bread</h2> <p>Good for breakfast toasted and simply buttered or slathered with marmalade. Yes, it's heaving with calories, but seeing as we're told that breakfast is the best time to eat like a king, then so be it. Once baked, I&#xa0;slice it and keep it in the freezer, then whip out a few slices and toast from frozen for those special mornings.</p> <p><strong>200ml medium sherry, such as oloroso dulce</strong><br><strong>200ml whole milk, plus a little extra for brushing</strong><br><strong>100g Seville marmalade</strong><br><strong>2 level tsp fast-action yeast</strong><br><strong>300g raisins</strong><br><strong>175g chopped almonds</strong><br><strong>500g strong white flour</strong><br><strong>100g rye flour</strong><br><strong>2 tsp fine salt</strong><br><strong>Oil and flour, for kneading and shaping</strong></p> <p>In a big bowl, stir together the sherry, milk, marmalade and yeast, add the raisins and almonds, and mix well. Add the flours and salt, work everything into a rough ball of dough, then cover the bowl and leave for 10 minutes. On a lightly oiled or floured surface, lightly knead the dough for a bare 10 seconds, return the dough to the bowl and leave for about two hours, until puffy and risen by half. Pat out the dough to about 2cm thick, then roll up tightly into a scroll and place seam-side down on a tray covered with nonstick paper. Cover with a cloth and leave for about an hour, until barely risen by half.</p> <p>Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan-assisted)/390F/gas mark 6, brush the top of the loaf with milk, and cut a 1cm-deep slash along the centre. Bake for about 40 minutes, until the crust is a good, rich golden-brown.</p> <h2>Sherry fruit bread pudding</h2> <p>The raisin bread also makes a good base for this pudding, which is lovely served barely warm with a little more sherry spooned over the top and some vanilla ice-cream. The combination of warm bread-and-butter pudding and cold ice-cream is embedded somewhere in my memory as one of the most comforting of all desserts.</p> <p><strong>75ml pedro ximenez or cream sherry</strong><br><strong>3 tsp vanilla extract</strong><br><strong>5 medium eggs</strong><br><strong>375ml milk</strong><br><strong>125ml double cream</strong><br><strong>Fruit bread (such as the one in the preceding recipe)</strong><br><strong>Butter</strong><br><strong>Sugar, to taste and finish (any sort)</strong></p> <p>Pour the sherry and vanilla into a bowl, crack in the eggs, beat until smooth, then stir in the milk and cream. Check it for sweetness, and add a little more sugar, if you prefer. Cut the bread into 1cm-thick slices, cut off the crusts, if you like, then butter the slices lightly. Cut the bread into fingers and lay these overlapping in the base of a large, deep one-litre ovenproof pudding dish. Only half-fill the dish (or even less, if you prefer a good custard base), pour on the egg mixture, press down the bread with a spoon so it softens, then leave to soak for 30 minutes. Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan-assisted)/350F/gas mark 4, dust a little sugar over the top and bake for 30-40 minutes, until the custard is barely set in the middle.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.danlepard.com/guardian\" title=\"\">danlepard.com/guardian</a></p>",

  "<p>When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/junot-diaz\" title=\"\">Junot D\u00edaz</a> published his debut collection of linked stories, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780571244973/drown\" title=\"\"><em>Drown</em></a>, in 1996, it appeared that the trajectory of his writing career had been set. Located in the barrios of New Jersey and the Dominican Republic, and filtered through the sensibility of a poor immigrant who made it to Rutgers University, the then 27-year-old's dispatches from his community \u2013 \"separated from all the other communities by a six lane highway and the dump\", as he said at the time \u2013 became a New York literary sensation. Prizes, commercial and critical acclaim, and attendant stories of large advances came accompanied by invitations to fancy parties and an assumption that D\u00edaz had embarked on a long and fruitful career.</p> <p>As things turned out he attended few of the literary parties \u2013 \"I discovered early that as an artist there was absolutely nothing wrong with being surrounded by people who were not dedicated to your field\" \u2013 and the money didn't last forever, not least because, far from becoming a fixture on the bestseller lists, D\u00edaz didn't produce another book for 12 years. \"Even I thought I would be a writer who put something out every year,\" he says now. \"But that's not how it worked out.\"</p> <p>However, despite the silence, his reputation, and, more surprisingly, his profile, remained strong. When<em> </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780571239733/the-brief-wondrous-life-of-oscar-wao\" title=\"\"><em>The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao</em></a> \u2013 a novel about a \"fat Dominican nerd, complete with Dungeons and Dragons dredged from my own nerd closet, which I'm sure my publishers wouldn't have expected after <em>Drown</em>\" \u2013 did emerge in 2008 it won the Pulitzer prize for fiction. This month he publishes his third book, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780571294190/this-is-how-you-lose-her\" title=\"\"><em>This Is How You Lose Her</em></a>, in which he returns to the characters and settings from <em>Drown</em>.</p> <p>\"There was a lot of background infidelity in <em>Drown</em>,\" he explains. \"And I knew I wanted to write another book of linked stories about the rise and fall of a cheater. I also wanted to return to the brother's cancer. He just disappears in <em>Drown</em>. You never get a sense of what happens to him.\" <em>This Is How You Lose Her</em> once again features Yunior, D\u00edaz's alter ego through whom he engages with the intersection of race, gender, immigration and class. Like D\u00edaz's brother, Yunior's brother contracted cancer, although D\u00edaz's brother survived. Like Yunior, D\u00edaz has a back problem \u2013 he constantly has to alternate between standing and sitting \u2013 as a result of delivering pool tables to pay his way through college.</p> <p>\"Our cancer stories are different, but what they share is a young person getting an early masterclass in mortality. I put the back problem in the very last rewrite having been working on that story for six years. It was the perfect punchline. The last piece of shit to throw on him. I furnish Yunior with a lot of my stuff so I don't have to buy anything new and while friends of mine can see small elements of me in him, I've spun him a little sharper to stand out more starkly. I don't go to his extremes of cruelty and nor do I have his Byronesque sensibilities. There is a lot of scepticism today as to whether memoir is real. But when fiction is done at a certain level there is scepticism as to whether it is really fiction.\"</p> <p>D\u00edaz, like Yunior, was born in 1968 in Santa Domingo, capital of the Dominican Republic. His father left to work in America shortly afterwards, and the family was eventually reunited in New Jersey when D\u00edaz, his mother and siblings \u2013 he is the third of five \u2013 emigrated in 1974. Just as D\u00edaz's stories straightforwardly accept that Yunior and some of his friends can be both ghetto kids and college kids \u2013 the narratives of street life are seamlessly punctuated by references to NYU, or to tenure or to Joyce classes \u2013 he says there was always \"a category anxiety around me\". Two of his siblings spent time in prison, while another has gone on to become a lawyer. \"I'm of African descent and my sister looks completely black, but I didn't look black. I was the super-nerdy kid who was also willing to fight. I love comics and SF but am hopeless with technology. I am still better with a pick or shovel, even with my bad back, than I am with computers.\"</p> <p>He says his remarkable use of language \u2013 his Spanglish is just one example of worlds colliding \u2013 was part of an attempt to unite the various parts of himself. \"I was from a very strict and conformist family, so it wasn't even permissible to cohere between home and the streets. Then came college and so on. In artistic terms it took a lot longer to work out than it should have. There are protocols in writing that are used to simplify things. It takes a while for an artist to work out that they can be broken. One of the contradictions of America's insane capitalism is that you will meet people like me who have lived in three or four worlds. Maybe it's to do with the fact that I'm straight and male, but I never saw any value in sealing off my background. I was critical, but I never felt one of the options was to entirely reject it. But it did take a long time for me to talk to my friends at home about the kind of books I read and the kind of politics I was interested in at college. It also took a long time for me to take my home into this larger and more intellectual world.\"</p> <p>At Rutgers in the late 80s and early 90s, both at college and in various bluecollar jobs, including in a steelworks, D\u00edaz was exposed to leftwing politics around race \u2013 South Africa and the LA riots \u2013 and gender. \"It was perfect for me. My father was a pro-dictatorship Dominican who fought on the side of the Americans during the invasion, but even as a kid I was super-left, although it was all a bit messed up and I was also homophobic as hell. I'm still politically radical, unfortunately. My students\" \u2013 he teaches at MIT \u2013 \"think it's hilarious. They find my leftwing ideas quaint and charming and want to have a picture taken next to me.\"</p> <p>While class and race politics were more visibly to the fore in <em>Drown</em>, <em>This Is How You Lose Her</em> is more obviously informed by feminist ideas. \"I grew up in a very segregated masculine world and I became fascinated by the way we represent ourselves in public. The disconnect between who we said we were and who we really were. There is nothing sadder than a 40 or 50-year-old man struggling with a mask that they have to be tough and constantly aggressive. I modelled Yunior's struggle on my earlier self in that it wasn't until my late 20s that I began to realise 'this shit doesn't work'. Over the 16 years this book took to write I always pictured this image of Yunior having this terrible metal mask that he is trying to tear off his face, all the while not sure whether he still has a face underneath it.\"</p> <p>He claims if you are a straight man, the litmus test of your humanity is your relationship with women. The omnipresent infidelity in the book follows Yunior from childhood, when he was dragged along on his father's \"pussy runs\", to his 40s, and the consequences of his own broken relationships take their toll. \"The entire culture leads us towards dehumanising women in our imaginations. I and my male friends could not have been as fucked-up in our relationships, or done the things we did in our relationships, if we felt that women were truly human. Because once you empathise that they are indeed human, you become incapable of hurting them. There is nothing that makes you think twice about fighting so much as getting your face broken. Yunior gets a romantic face-breaker and begins to understand what he has been doing throughout his adult life.\" D\u00edaz says he is unsure whether Yunior will return \u2013 \"I write so darn slowly it's difficult to say\" \u2013 but while the next book will definitely not be about him, \"I would want to write a more traditional novel about his crazy life.\"</p> <p>Since the long hiatus after <em>Drown</em>, D\u00edaz says he has become more comfortable with his pace of working. \"I put way too much pressure on myself for a while. It's easy to self-dramatise, but after <em>Drown</em> I went through so many relationships, so many apartments and so much fucking liquor. What a dick! But eventually you calm down.\" And, in hindsight, he sees value in the long wait. \"I know good things made it into <em>Oscar Wao</em> that simply wouldn't have come up if I'd been able to write it in six months. It does take time to see things properly.\"</p> <p>He says as a kid there were so many secrets in his family that he became attuned to looking beneath the surface of things. \"For instance we didn't know that one of our siblings was a half-sibling, but we did know that something was up. That was good training \u2013 to be in a family where you really had to keep your ears and eyes open. Then you go into the world and you see secrets everywhere in plain sight.\"</p> <p>His next book will be a \"monster, zombie, alien invasion story that my sister might read. Having a reader in mind is just a way of setting the bar high and hoping they give good marks. In this case my sister will be holding up the cards. She is a very smart person who doesn't like bullshit, so I'm trying to do something straightforward that is also intense and funny.\"</p> <p>As to the wider state of fiction he acknowledges a declining readership and that writers do not have the same general appeal they had 30 years ago. \"Gore Vidal and Norman Mailer would be on the Johnny Carson just talking about their new novels. Now you can only get on Jon Stewart if you talk about an issue raised in your novel. Spaces for contemplation and deliberation have been greatly reduced. Most people don't spend two or three hours thinking or reading. Books seem to be artefacts from a slower time.\"</p> <p>But as an editor on the Boston Review, encouraging fiction submissions from young writers, he declares himself hopeful. \"Books are surviving in this intense, fragmented, hyper-accelerated present, and my sense and hope is that things will slow down again and people will want more time for a contemplative life. There is no way people can keep up this pace. No one is happy. Two or three hours to read should not be an unattainable thing, although I hope we get to that stage without needing a corporate sponsored app to hold our hand. The utopian in me has my fingers crossed that we haven't quite figured out the digital future just yet. After all, the one thing we know about people: they always surprise.\"</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/zadiesmith\" title=\"\">Zadie Smith</a>'s new novel is oddly divided between confidence and indecision. The confidence is easy to understand, given an enviable alignment of talent and readership, which offers the possibility of being faithful to roots without being bound by them, ignoring the old rules about minorities and the mainstream, and politely rejecting the role of poster girl for post-ethnicity. The indecision is harder to account for. Uncertainty keeps on cracking the pavements and makes for a stumbling journey through the streets of the book.</p> <p>\"NW\" is north-west London, though the focus is tighter, largely on Willesden (south London being no more relevant than Tierra del Fugo). The main character in the first section is Leah Hanwell, a Willesdener of Irish descent now in her mid-30s, brought up on a council estate with a dodgy reputation, still living nearby though in relative comfort. Leah has a philosophy degree but works ingloriously in an office where powerlessness is dressed up in the language of empowerment. She is warmly teased \u2013 with an undercurrent of real resentment \u2013 by her female, African-Caribbean co-workers (and they're all female and African-Caribbean) for having laid hands on a treasure that rightly belongs to their community \u2013 her husband Michel, a francophone black man hoping to earn a better living from online investing than he has from hairdressing. The only flaw in the marriage is that Michel wants children and Leah does not, though she's never said so.</p> <p>There's a lovely rippling effect over the opening pages, with Leah's thoughts and surroundings enriching each other, rather in the manner of <em>Ulysses</em>. It begins to look as if Joyce will be the patron saint of this novel, as Forster watched over the previous one (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780141019451/on-beauty\" title=\"\"><em>On Beauty</em></a>). It's a style that doesn't bed down, though. The short length of sections works against the sense of total immersion that suits stream-of-consciousness writing. There are still modernist moments, but they take the form of minor flourishes, such as Leah's wandering thoughts being presented on one page in the shape of a tree, and a monologue from Michel (to which she's barely listening) on the next.</p> <p>Leah may be a native Londoner, but she has her naive side, and falls for the standard hard-luck story (mother desperately ill in hospital, no money for a taxi) told to her by a distressed woman knocking at the door. She offers \u00a330, feeling some sort of rapport, particularly when it turns out that the two of them went to the same underperforming school. Michel and her mother make common cause in scolding her for gullibility, but even when she realises she has been scammed Leah's feelings for the con artist (name of Shar) remain conflicted.</p> <p>These tendrils of plot and situation could be trained across the trellis of various genres. A woman who wants everything but the baby her man has set his heart on? Chick lit but with deeper possibilities. An encounter with a stranger leading to an invisible criminal underworld very close at hand? London Gothic \u00e0 la <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/ruth-rendell\" title=\"\">Ruth Rendell</a>, perhaps, but with convincing youth details. Smith doesn't develop these strands, but she doesn't risk cutting them loose altogether.</p> <p>Meanwhile the tempo slackens, as if a well fitted-out yacht were waiting for a breeze that never comes. Not all the secondary decisions are successful, but at least they get made. One of them is to present dialogue without inverted commas, as Joyce did (he hated those marks, calling them \"perverted commas\"), using a dash instead. This preference calls for extra clarity when it comes to demarcating the end of speeches. What to make of this, for instance? \"\u2013 I can see the magistrates' court and \u2026 a roundabout? Kids, stay close, stay in. It's like walking the hard shoulder on the motorway. Nightmare. Kennedy Fried Chicken. Polish Bar and Pool. Euphoria Massage. Glad we took the scenic route. This can't still be Willesden. Feels like we're in Neasden already.\" <em>Ulysses</em> taught readers to read sentence-fragments as signals that the barriers between inside and outside, speech and thought, were dissolving, but here the whole paragraph seems to be spoken aloud.</p> <p>There's an unpredictably changing distance in the point of view as it addresses Leah. The equivalent in a film would be jarring alternation between long shot, two shot and extreme close-up. There's even some wobble in matters of detail. Leah's mother thinks goods in Poundland can be priced at \u00a32.49, and a local chemist's does a brisk trade developing films. At one stage Leah puts a payment on an old credit card from her student days, to prevent Michel from finding out. That's quite a trick, with a card so long expired.</p> <p>The whole of the first section is defined by its resistance to genre, by what it doesn't want to be. It's like an oddly shaped inner-city park, bounded not only by chick-lit and thriller but by the modernism it aspires to. The touches of dilute Joycean play are less like new ways of looking at the world than mildly adventurous ways of organising a narrative. <em>NW</em> even abuts on the territory of the \"Hampstead novel\" (Hampstead being geographically close however socially and spiritually distant), that antique dismissive term for novels in which middle-class people alternately gloat and lament over their privileges. Leah's oldest friend Natalie invites her and Michel to dinner parties whose conversation is reproduced as a composite stream of banalities (\"Let me tell you about Islam\") and food fetishism (\"Pass the green beans with shaved almonds\"). There's a touch of bad faith here, since successful authors are rarely looking at dinner-party rituals from below the salt. The whole book is oddly queasy about the value of getting on in the world.</p> <p>In the next section the tone warms up. Inverted commas make a return, like birdless wings after some seasonal migration, bringing with them an immediate uplift in terms of readability. The main character here is Felix Cooper, a recovering addict putting his life back together and rejoicing in a recently established relationship. Encounters with his father and a neighbour sketch in a painful but not hopeless background. The dialogue can't avoid the pervasive non-interrogatives \"innit\" and \"is it\", but isn't ruled by them (\"to chirps\", meaning \" to chat up\", is lovely). Felix sets out from NW6 to W1 to inspect a derelict sports car owned by a posh boy named Tom, going cheap, but also pays a visit on impulse to Annie, an ex-lover of his based in Soho.</p> <p>It's perverse to represent Tom's point of view, without the necessary knowledge or sympathy, but Annie is the one privileged character in the book who isn't dead on the page, perhaps because she survives by performing her class status, in the hope that poshness will disguise poverty. The section about Felix's day is certainly the most successful in the book, though it connects weakly with the rest, as if this were a separate project, imperfectly incorporated.</p> <p>The rest of the book is devoted to Leah's friend Natalie. There's nothing limited about female friendship as a subject, as long as you have confidence in it. But the Leah panel and the Natalie panel simply don't line up \u2013 the hinges grind. The time scheme moves past the original dramatic set-up, the entanglement with Shar, as if it had never been important.</p> <p>This is the section that works hardest to achieve consistency of tone, but the chosen tone is an odd one, of brittle distance. The character is routinely referred to as \"Natalie Blake\", as if the writer was reminding herself not to get close. Numbered subsections suggest a series of propositions, about marginality, education, privilege, rather than a felt story. Sometimes subsections need a title to clarify an allusion, so that \"178. Beehive\" establishes, for the reader in need of clues, that the singer being described (\"this voice sounded like London\") is indeed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/amywinehouse\" title=\"\">Amy Winehouse</a>. Similar contortions of reference shroud perfectly ordinary mentions of <em>Friends</em> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/wire\" title=\"\"><em>The Wire</em></a>. There's no sophisticated response to the world that excludes irony, but the irony here seems anxious and self-protective. It's in this section, where she works hardest at building a wall between character and reader, that Smith also feels the need to break through it with misjudged interventions along the lines of \"You're welcome\" and \"In case you were wondering \u2026\" The conflicts within the writer are deeper than the ones she has devised for her characters.</p> <p>The trailing plot threads aren't exactly tied off, more tucked back in. The real mystery of <em>NW</em> is that it falls so far short of being a successful novel, though it contains the makings of three&#xa0;or four.</p> <p>\u2022 Adam Mars-Jones's <em>Cedilla</em> is published by Faber.</p>",

Classic spots include The Meridian Room (3611 Parry Avenue, <a href=\"http://www.themeridianroom.com/\" title=\"\">themeridianroom.com</a>) and Amsterdam (831 Exposition Avenue, <a href=\"http://amsterdambar.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\">theamsterdambar.com</a>), and legendary music venues include Trees (2709 Elm Street, <a href=\"http://treesdallas.com/\" title=\"\">treesdallas.com</a>) where Nirvana, Soul Asylum, and other grunge bands played in the early 1990s; Club Dada (2720 Elm Street, <a href=\"http://dadadallas.com/\" title=\"\">dadadallas.com</a>), and for metal music heads Reno's Chop Shop (210 N Crowdus Street, <a href=\"http://www.renoschopshop.com/\" title=\"\">renoschopshop.com</a>).

Over the years this historic area has been the home of Stevie Ray Vaughan, Erykah Badu, Edie Brickell, Dennis Rodman, and T-Bone Walker. Oak Cliff&#xa0; gets slapped around a lot in the media \u2013 it was the home of Bonnie and Clyde, and Lee Harvey Oswald \u2013 but it has undergone a renaissance lately.</p> <p>Lockhart Smokehouse (400 West Davis, <a href=\"http://www.lockhartsmokehouse.com\" title=\"\">lockhartsmokehouse.com</a>) does the best barbecue in Dallas in my opinion \u2013 order from the counter and eat with your fingers. Bolsa (614 West Davis, +1 214 367 9367, <a href=\"http://bolsadallas.com\" title=\"\">bolsadallas.com</a>) does great modern American; and Eno's (407 North Bishop Avenue, <a href=\"http://enospizza.com/\" title=\"\">enospizza.com</a>), a pizza place and tavern, is also worth checking out. There are some cool vintage clothing and antique shops, such as Zola's Everyday Vintage (414 North Bishop Avenue, <a href=\"http://www.zolasvintage.com\" title=\"\">zolasvintage.com</a>) and DFW M'Antiques (424 West Davis Street), an antique store geared towards men that offers free beer.</p> <p><strong>Lakewood</strong> (<a href=\"http://lakewoodguide.net/\" title=\"\">lakewoodguide.net</a>) next to White Rock Lake, has a relaxed vibe that leaves you wondering if it's a suburb of Austin. You might also call it Dallas for People Who Hate the Big City. It has drawn hippies, hipsters, artists and families, creating a sense of community. A few favourite haunts include the Cock and Bull (1920 Abrams Parkway, <a href=\"http://www.cockandbulldallas.com/\" title=\"\">cockandbulldallas.com</a>) a pub that also serves the best burger in Dallas; Cosmo's Lounge (1212 Skillman Street, <a href=\"http://cosmosbar.com/\" title=\"\">cosmosbar.com</a>) a 1960s-style martini bar with excellent pizza; Arcade Bar (1825 Abrams Parkway), and the Lakewood Landing (5818 Liveoak, +1 214 823 2410, <a href=\"http://lakewood-landing.com/\" title=\"\">lakewood-landing.com</a>). It's also home to the historic Lakewood Theater (<a href=\"http://www.lakewoodtheater.com/\" title=\"\">lakewoodtheater.com</a>), which opened in&#xa0;1938, and features occasional burlesque shows and gigs.</p> <p>The Dallas Museum of Art (<a href=\"http://dm-art.org/\" title=\"\">dm-art.org</a>), the Nasher Sculpture garden (<a href=\"http://www.nashersculpturecenter.org/\" title=\"\">nashersculpturecenter.org</a>) and the Crow Collection of Asian Art (<a href=\"http://www.crowcollection.com/\" title=\"\">crowcollection.com</a>) stand together downtown in the <strong>Arts District </strong>(<a href=\"http://www.thedallasartsdistrict.org\" title=\"\">thedallasartsdistrict.org</a>).<strong> </strong>Both the DMA and the Nasher have late-night events once a month or so, with bands, movies, and food trucks.</p> <h2>Fun things to do<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395588771\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2012/8/30/1346346738438/M-Line-trolley-in-Dallas.-001.jpg\" alt=\"M-Line trolley in Dallas. \" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dallas's M-Line trolley </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The M-Line (<a href=\"http://www.mata.org/map.shtml\" title=\"\">mata.org</a>) is a system of four (mostly) air-conditioned and heated vintage <strong>trolley buses</strong> running 365 days a year around Dallas's vibrant Uptown neighbourhood. All rides are free, though there is a donations box.</p> <p>The <strong>Dallas skyline</strong> is well worth admiring. The bar of my favourite hotel, the Belmont (<a href=\"http://www.belmontdallas.com\" title=\"\">belmontdallas.com</a>, stylish rooms from $99), patios at Bryan Street Tavern (<a href=\"http://www.bryanstreettavern.com/\" title=\"\">bryanstreettavern.com</a>) and The Cedars Social (<a href=\"http://thecedarssocial.com/\" title=\"\">thecedarssocial.com</a>) are some of the locations affording great views. A scene in the second episode of Dallas was filmed here, with John Ross Ewing and Christopher Ewing. Or take a free elevator ride to the roof of the old <strong>Sears Roebuck</strong> building (<a href=\"http://www.southsideonlamar.com/The-Building/Past.aspx\" title=\"\">southsideonlamar.com</a>) which is now loft housing. It has the most amazing view: as you stand below it, the rooftop sign feels a bit like the Hollywood hill sign.&#xa0; The cast of Dallas actually stayed here for some portion of the filming of the series. </p> <p>But the best panorama of the city is from <strong>Reunion Tower</strong> (+1 214 741 5560, <a href=\"http://www.reuniontower.com/\" title=\"\">reuniontower.com</a>). The Big Ball on its top is synonymous with the Dallas skyline. Catch a happy hour or eat in the restaurant Five Sixty by Wolfgang Puck (+1 214 741 5560, <a href=\"http://www.wolfgangpuck.com/restaurants/fine-dining/3917/\" title=\"\">wolfgangpuck.com</a>), named for the number of feet it sits above ground.</p> <p>Since 1989, the <strong>Sixth Floor Museum</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.jfk.org/\" title=\"\">jfk.org</a>) at Dealey Plaza has welcomed more than six million visitors seeking information about the assassination of President Kennedy on 22 November 1963 in the plaza outside. The 50th anniversary of the shooting is coming up and the conspiracy theorists are foaming at the mouth. I've heard that the X on the street that marks the spot where Kennedy was shot moves every year. How's that for a conspiracy?</p> <p>Adults can relive their childhood playing two-foot-high Jenga and 1980s video games at <strong>Barcadia</strong> (1917 North Henderson Avenue, <a href=\"http://barcadiabars.com/\" title=\"\">barcadiabars.com</a>). It has several nostalgic video games as well as early-20th-century arcade game skeeball, all for 50 cents a game.&#xa0;</p> <p>Lots of people come to Dallas expecting to see <strong>cowboys</strong> and are disappointed. But the cowboy is alive and well in Fort Worth (part of the Dallas \"metroplex\"), and nowhere more so than at the <strong>Fort Worth Stockyards </strong>(140 East Exchange Avenue, <a href=\"http://www.fortworthstockyards.org/\" title=\"\">fortworthstockyards.org</a>), a working Old West ranch which is touristy but fun. Go on a Friday or Saturday night to see the rodeo or catch a show at Billy Bob's, the country music club that bills itself as the world's largest honky tonk. Nearby at <strong>Sundance Square</strong> in downtown are hip restaurants and rooftop cocktail bars.</p> <p>If you'd rather hear some real <strong>Texas blues</strong>, head for The Goat (7248 Gaston Avenue, <a href=\"http://www.thegoatdallas.com/\" title=\"\">thegoatdallas.com</a>) and Brooklyn's (1701 South Lamar Street, <a href=\"http://www.brooklynjazzcafe.com/\" title=\"\">brooklynjazzcafe.com</a>) which have blues bands or open mic opportunities nearly every night.</p> <h2>Where to eat</h2> <p>Unless you're vegetarian, you can't visit Dallas without chowing down on some <strong>barbecue</strong>. Off the Bone (1734 South Lamar Street, +1 214 565 9551, <a href=\"http://offthebonebarbeque.com/\" title=\"\">offthebonebarbeque.com</a>) is best for ribs. Hispanic culture is huge in Texas \u2013 but Texans like to put our own spin on the classics, which is why we call it <strong>Tex-Mex</strong>. My two favourite Tex-Mex establishments are Desperados (4818 Greenville Avenue, <a href=\"http://www.desperadosrestaurant.com/index.php#\" title=\"\">desperadosrestaurant.com</a>), a family-owned joint with great fajitas, and Pepe's &amp; Mito's in Deep Ellum (2911 Elm Street, <a href=\"http://www.pepesandmitos.com/\" title=\"\">pepesandmitos.com</a>), which does chipotle wine sauce enchiladas I have had dreams about.</p> <p>Dallas is also big on street tacos, except they are not on the street. Fuel City (<a href=\"http://www.fuelcity-tacos.com/home.htm\" title=\"\">fuelcity-tacos.com</a>), Rusty Taco (<a href=\"http://www.therustytaco.com/\" title=\"\">therustytaco.com</a>), and Good 2 Go Taco (<a href=\"http://www.good2gotaco.com/\" title=\"\">good2gotaco.com</a>) are three of the best for inexpensive fajita, shrimp, and picadillo (ground beef with spices) tacos. All these places, especially Good 2 Go Taco, offer vegetarian and healthy options that are just as yummy.</p> <p>If meat is not your thing, try the healthy fare at the <strong>Dallas Farmers Market</strong> (1010 South Pearl Expressway, <a href=\"http://www.dallasfarmersmarket.org/\" title=\"\">dallasfarmersmarket.org</a>), a downtown fixture for six decades and now one of the largest public markets of its type in the country.

  "<p>Exam in coalition policy on universities and immigration, summer 2012. Take a stab at EACH of the following THREE questions:</p> <p>1. How arbitrary would you say is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/aug/30/taskforce-london-met-international-students\" title=\"\">the ban on London Met University</a> from teaching foreigners from outside the EU? Give reasons.</p> <p>2. What are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/video/2012/aug/30/london-metropolitan-university-students-march-video?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">the approx 2,700 international students of London Met</a> meant to do now, just weeks before term starts?</p> <p>3. Does David Cameron want to boost export earnings or <a href=\"http://mainlymacro.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/the-pernicious-politics-of-immigration.html\" title=\"\">slash the number of non-Europeans coming to this country</a>? Discuss.</p> <p>There are other questions that should be asked after this week's withdrawal of London Met's favoured status for sponsoring students from outside the EU, such as why the UK Border Agency took this drastic step on such limited evidence. And how far either Vince Cable or David Willetts was consulted, seeing as higher education falls into their departmental brief, and yet both men are officially on holiday. If officials found that 26 out of their sample of 101 students had no valid visa to remain in the UK, that is an argument for investigation \u2013 not for causing mayhem for about 2,700 non-EU students, many part of the way through degrees or PhD research, and who now have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/31/london-met-international-students?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">60 days to find an alternative place of study, or otherwise to face deportation</a>. UKBA does not even try to claim that all the 2,700 are here illegitimately.</p> <p>To be clear, however limited the evidence that has been presented of foreign students at London Met here without proper papers or even a working knowledge of the English language, it still gives cause for concern. For one thing, it's not fair on students to fork out more than \u00a310,000 for a year's teaching that they cannot even follow \u2013 let alone for their classmates and teachers. But the question is of proportion \u2013 both in the numbers that fall into this serious category and in the punishment visited on London Met, which now faces the loss of an estimated 15% of its annual income (so vital are overseas tuition fees).</p> <p>This has the hallmarks of a decision made with an eye on immigration targets rather than the reputation of the higher education sector \u2013 the inevitable result of putting student figures in the government's cap on immigration. That was always an idiotic decision. Whether the US or Australia, our competitors treat international students as visitors \u2013 rightly so, as 80% of them don't settle here. From Nehru to Aung San Suu Kyi, many are the foreign students who have passed through British academia. This is in all senses a valuable tradition; how terrible that it should be jeopardised by a particularly bone-headed bit of target chasing.</p>",
  "<p>I was a principal lecturer at <a href=\"http://www.londonmet.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">London Metropolitan University</a> until 2009. It is a scandal that those suffering the consequences of the mismanagement that has led to the revocation of its licence to educate non-EU students will again be the students and staff rather than the culpable (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/aug/30/london-metropolitan-university-international-students?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Ban on non-EU students leaves 3,000 at risk of deportation</a>, 30 August).</p> <p>The university management under vice-chancellor Malcolm Gillies seems to have wilfully ignored warnings of things going wrong. In 2010 I wrote to Professor Gillies expressing my concerns about what I saw as widespread failure of institutional processes. A new senior management team was essential if systems and procedures were to improve, but in fact little changed and things only got worse. The government needs to focus on finding a better way of running and regulating our universities, not punishing international students for the sins of administrators and regulators.<br><strong>Dr James Chiriyankandath </strong><br><em>Institute of Commonwealth Studies, University of London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Anyone concerned about the UK's reputation overseas and London's global status as the most popular destination city for foreign students will be dismayed at the damaging and disproportionate way in which the <a href=\"http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">UK Border Agency</a> has handled its dispute with London Met over its sponsorship of students from outside the EU. Of course the agency is right to expect a high level of administrative competence from trusted sponsors, so the public retains confidence in the system. It would be justified in requiring any university found wanting to improve its procedures. But pulling the rug from beneath all the university's existing non-EU students has caused unnecessary distress to people who are here legitimately and who have invested a great deal of money in their education and, thus, in the UK.</p> <p>Moreover, it has undermined an institution that plays a vital role in London's, and the UK's, educational infrastructure. For example, London Met educates more students from ethnic minorities than all of the Oxbridge colleges put together and attracts thousands of bona fide overseas students, whose fees effectively subsidise indigenous students' education.</p> <p>The harm done to Britain's reputation in their countries of origin will inevitably affect future applications to all British universities. Foreign students contributed about \u00a38bn to the UK economy in 2009. The government says it wants to encourage them, but its actions \u2013 from heavy-handed behaviour by UKBA to their illogical inclusion in the statistics on permanent migration \u2013 suggest the opposite.<br><strong>John Dickie</strong><br><em>Director of strategy and policy, </em><a href=\"http://www.london-first.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>London&#xa0;First</em></a></p> <p>\u2022 With the threat to compromise the Ecuadorean embassy's status and the continued difficulty with tourist visa processes for many prospective visitors, is there some kind of ministerial competition to see who can cause most damage to the UK's image abroad? We should welcome bona fide visitors and students, be grateful for their interest and not treat them like criminals.<br><strong>Tim Fairhurst</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 I was a lecturer at one of the precursor colleges of LMU and elsewhere in higher education, so know the potential difficulties of telling second- and third-year students to transfer to another institution. While it may be appropriate to penalise LMU by withdrawing its licence to admit new first-year students, it is entirely wrong to penalise students who have got to the later stages of their courses. If the courses are still running with UK and EU students, which I assume they will be, then why not allow the non-EU students to enrol and finish their qualifications? The benefits to the students and to the reputation of UK higher education will be immense.<br><strong>Dr Roger Lowery</strong><br><em>Bromyard, Herefordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 I am a former Metropolitan police border control officer and, while working on the controls over the years, have witnessed some amazing decisions in relation to the admission of bogus students. There should be two major barriers to bogus students \u2013 first, the visa and, second, UK border control when the student arrives. The issuing of UK visas has been subject to cost-cutting to the extent that virtually no visa applicants are interviewed. Everything is paper/email-based (a recent decision does allow prospective Pakistani students to be interviewed, owing to the complete shambles that exists in relation to UK visas in that country).</p> <p>Despite the rhetoric, a bogus student who re-enters the UK after, say, a holiday and who is discovered as bogus by the UKBF officer (for example, if he or she is barely literate) is still allowed into the UK to appeal, and is told to report back for interview and further enquiries. Many chief immigration officers have so little faith in the system that they instruct that the \"student\" be landed even though they are clearly bogus. Virtually no bogus students who are discovered in this way are ever removed.</p> <p>Yet genuine foreign students are often treated appallingly, especially in their dealings with the Home Office. Genuine students already here should be allowed to complete their courses without undergoing the stress that this situation creates. Any task force should focus on those foreign students due to arrive in the UK over the next few days with the intention of studying at London Met. <br><strong>Chris Hobbs</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 I teach ESL students in Ethiopia and Romania for the Open University, and used to teach very diverse students at LMU. In all these cases, I have had few serious problems of comprehension. Teaching such students is a skill, which it seems your cowardly anonymous LMU lecturer (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/aug/30/lmu-student-recruitment-teaching-learning?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Comment</a>, 31 August) has not acquired. She or he says s/he hopes that academic standards will improve. Even if that were to be necessary (and I dispute that), the tragedy of the present situation is that there is likely soon to be no university left to set any standards at all.<br><strong>Dr Michael Dempsey</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 The Guardian University Awards (Ad, 30 August) has the category \"Commitment to widening participation\".

  "<p>Polly Toynbee is right about the need for Lib-Lab co-operation to replace the present government (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/30/miliband-labour-forgive-lib-dems?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Comment</a>, 31 August). But this needs to happen fast, given that the UK's economy is in tatters and our social infrastructure is being so cruelly and quickly dismantled. As Jubilympic euphoria fades and the harsh reality sinks in, this provides Labour with a golden opportunity. It should declare its intention of forcing an election in 2013 and discuss with non-cabinet Lib Dems a deal not to stand against them, if that would mean a Tory victory in their seat. Any remaining Labour fantasists hoping for a majority next time should heed Peter Hain's warning that voter promiscuity makes this very unlikely. <br><strong>Colin Hines</strong><br><em>East Twickenham, Middlesex</em></p> <p>\u2022 Polly Toynbee does the cause of Labour-Lib Dem co-operation her usual disservice with her patronising call that \"Labour must forgive the Lib Dems\". Strange as it may seem to her, Lib Dems neither seek nor value any such forgiveness. We do not see ourselves as Labour's prodigal son. If anyone needs to seek forgiveness, from British voters and Iraqis, it is arrogant Labour. The war in Iraq and accompanying lies, the contempt for freedom, the encouragement of obscene wealth, as well as the huge public overspend and dire local government record, have left Labour with a vast respect deficit.</p> <p>Liberal Democrats have no need to pretend to be more radical than Labour, it is just a fact. Our raising of the income tax threshold, the pupil premium for disadvantaged kids, improvement in pensions, ending of protest bans, unjustified stop and search and child migrant detention are all measures Labour failed to deliver in 13 years and we have in two.<br><strong>Sarah Ludford MEP</strong><br><em>Liberal Democrat, London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Cursed with a long memory, I'm perturbed by suggestions that Labour should cosy up to the Lib Dems. Thirty-five years ago the Lib-Lab pact of the late 1970s proved a misjudgment. It encouraged both the rise of Thatcherism and the defection of the SDP faction, leaving the great coalition that is the Labour party unbalanced and distracted for several years.</p> <p>We have an electoral system, recently endorsed by referendum, best suited to there being only two large parties. Our system would therefore function better if the Lib Dems reverted to the status enjoyed by the Liberals the 1960s; half a dozen oddball seats and the occasional by-election triumph. As the Tories may soon learn, getting into bed with an unpredictable third party can satisfy short-term cravings, but often brings long-term grief.<br><strong>Brian Hughes</strong><br><em>Cheltenham, Gloucestershire </em></p> <p>\u2022 The letter above from Sarah Ludford MEP was amended on 3 September 2012.

  "<p>After losing four houses to four hurricanes Melanie Martinez was arguably America's unluckiest woman. There was Betsy in 1965, Juan in 1985, George in 1998 and Katrina in 2005, ferocious storms that swept in from the Gulf of Mexico&#xa0;and wrecked each of Martinez's homes. Such was the&#xa0;peril of living on a flood plain in Louisiana.</p> <p>A few months ago the schoolbus driver's luck changed. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/26/garden/a-house-makeover-show-has-its-debut-on-ae-network-qa.html\" title=\"\">Hideous Houses</a>, a reality TV show on the A&amp;E channel, selected her not quite hideous but admittedly ramshackle house in Braithwaite, a rural town just south of New Orleans, for a makeover. The host, Eric Stromer (one of the sexiest people alive, according to People magazine), and his team spent a week and $20,000 transforming the Martinez home with a new kitchen, new cupboards, new appliances (including a 50in smart&#xa0;TV), even creating a new room for Melanie's passion, sewing. It aired a few weeks ago. \"They did a real good job. I loved it,\" says Martinez.</p> <p>If you were paying attention to the news last week you know where this story is going. On Wednesday 29 August \u2013 the seventh anniversary of Katrina \u2013 a category 1 hurricane named Isaac howled in from the Gulf and hit Mississippi and Louisiana. A $14.5bn federally funded bolstering of flood-control systems around New Orleans <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-news-blog/2012/aug/30/hurricane-isaac-new-orleans-defences\" title=\"\">spared the city</a>. However, Braithwaite was sheltered only by an 8ft levee built by Louisiana's state government. Thus Martinez became \u2013 who could now argue? \u2013 America's unluckiest woman.</p> <p>\"There was a mandatory evacuation order and we were leaving, just like our neighbours,\" she says. \"We never stay for storms. I&#xa0;would never jeopardise my mom \u2013 she's 74 and needs dialysis. But my truck broke down.\" Around 2am floodwaters \"overtopped\" the levee, sending a 12ft surge through Braithwaite. The family sought refuge in the attic. \"We thought we were going to die in that house; the water was coming up so fast. My husband used a hammer to put a hole in the roof but it broke. We used our hands and feet to punch the hole.\"</p> <p>A boat rescued them along with their five kittens and three dogs. Everything else was lost. \"Now I've lost five houses to five storms. Every time a wipe-out.\" Martinez seems grateful to be alive, even perky, but knows tears will come once waters subside and she returns to a sodden wreck. \"Why live in Louisiana?\" She ponders the question. \"I was born here.

He was relaxed and smiling. Asked whether he was about to win his battle against his former friend and fellow oligarch Roman Abramovich, he replied: \"I'm confident. I believe in the system.\"</p> <p>Fifteen minutes later the same English justice system \u2013 in the formidable shape of Mrs Justice Gloster \u2013 gave Berezovsky an almighty and devastating kick up the backside. The judge dismissed his case and his claim that he was a partner with Abramovich in the Russian oil group Sibneft. But worse than this she also demolished Berezovsky's character, describing him in her judgment as \"dishonest\", \"unreliable\" and even \"deluded\".</p> <p>Instead of emerging with $5bn (\u00a33.15bn) in damages, as he had hoped, Berezovsky left with a huge legal bill and his reputation in tatters. He had told the court that Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea FC, had intimidated him to sell his share in the oil firm Sibneft at a massive discount. Abramovich vehemently denied this.</p> <p>But who would the judge believe? At 10.30am Gloster walked into court. There was a dramatic hush. The first three rows were packed with lawyers \u2013 the true winners in this, the biggest private litigation battle in history. There were journalists and supporters. Berezovsky sat near the door. Two bodyguards with earpieces were behind him. Abramovich wasn't there, his whereabouts a mystery. \"He's probably on his yacht in Corfu or Marbella,\" someone whispered.</p> <p>First, Gloster threw out Berezovsky's case. Then she gave her reasons. They were withering, in the kind of remorseless language rarely heard in the high court. Berezovsky, we discovered, had destroyed himself early on in the witness box. \"On my analysis of the entirety of the evidence, I found Mr Berezovsky an unimpressive, and inherently unreliable, witness, who regarded truth as a transitory, flexible concept, which could be moulded to suit his current purposes,\" the judge said.</p> <p>Berezovsky clutched his face. She went on: \"At times the evidence which he gave was deliberately dishonest; sometimes he was clearly making his evidence up as he went along in response to the perceived difficulty in answering the questions in a manner consistent with his case.</p> <p>\"At other times, I gained the impression that he was not necessarily being deliberately dishonest, but had deluded himself into believing his own version of events. On occasions he tried to avoid answering questions by making long and irrelevant speeches, or by professing to have forgotten facts which he had been happy to record in his pleadings or witness statements.\"</p> <p>It was Berezovsky's most excruciating moment, and the worst since he fled to Britain in 2000. Berezovsky left Russia after falling out with the steely Vladimir Putin, and has been a bitter critic of the Kremlin ever since. President Putin has had a grudge against the British judicial system since it granted Berezovsky political asylum in 2003. Putin could have been forgiven for allowing himself a wry grin, as another court comprehensively trashed Berezovsky's reputation.</p> <p>Abramovich, by contrast, has been a model of political loyalty. He is said to be on good terms with Putin. Many have wondered how the diffident and unassuming Abramovich became one of the richest people on the planet. The case provided the answer, with even Berezovsky admitting he was \"very charming\". In his witness statement Berezovsky said that Abramovich's secret was simple: he was \"good at getting people to like him\".</p> <p>Certainly some of this appears to have worked on Gloster. The judge told the court she concluded Abramovich was a \"truthful and on the whole reliable witness\". He \"gave careful and thoughtful answers, which were focused on the specific issues about which he was being questioned.\" She added: \"At all times, he was concerned to ensure that he understood the precise question, and the precise premise underlying the question which he was being asked.\"</p> <p>Forty minutes into the judgment, it was clear Abramovich had won game, set and match. The judge dismissed in \"its entirety\" Berezovsky's claim that he had been a partner in Sibneft, set up in the mid-1990s when Russia's then president, Boris Yeltsin, practically gifted state assets to a small group of well-connected businessmen: the oligarchs. (In return they helped him dubiously win Russia's 1996 election.) She also rejected a second Berezovsky claim for $564m, his alleged share of a joint interest with Abramovich in the aluminium group Rusal.</p> <p>Instead, Gloster accepted Abramovich's version of history: that he had been compelled to hire Berezovsky for his political connections. Back in 1994 Berezovsky was Yeltsin's occasional tennis-partner and a powerful figure in the corridors of the Kremlin. Abramovich was a young and ambitious oil trader. Gloster accepted the relationship had been one of \"<em>krysha</em>\" \u2013 the Russian word for roof \u2013 with Berezovsky giving Abramovich physical and political protection, indispensable in the murky world of Russian business. (The judge prounounced \"krysha\" to rhyme with Trisha, rather than the Russian way, \"kreesha\".)</p> <p>The judge even ruled that Putin hadn't tried to intimidate Berezovsky into selling his TV channel ORT, during an uncomfortable Kremlin showdown in 2000, shortly before Berezovsky fled. Her finding prompted seasoned Russian watchers to guffaw. Afterwards, a stunned Berezovsky emerged into the corridor. The judge had tried to rewrite Russian history, he said, adding that his faith in British justice had now been badly shaken. Had he expected to win? \"Absolutely.\"</p> <p>In the street outside, Berezovsky said he hadn't decided yet whether to appeal \u2013 a tricky step, one suspects, given the judge's devastating comments. \"I'm absolutely amazed what happened today. I'm surprised completely,\" Berezovsky said. He added: \"Sometimes I had the impression Putin himself wrote this judgment.\" The oligarch said he didn't regret bringing the case, and even attempted a phlegmatic note, observing: \"Life is life,\" before speeding off in a black Mercedes.</p> <p>Abramovich's lawyers said they were pleased their client had been \"comprehensively vindicated\". They added: \"We appreciate that, to many people, this case has been a uniquely Russian one, and should therefore have been heard in the Russian court system. Nevertheless, Mr Abramovich has always had great faith in the fairness of the English legal system and is both pleased and grateful for today's outcome.\"</p> <p>All that remains now is to tot up the legal bills. The court heard that Berezovsky had recently sold his luxury home in Wentworth, Surrey, and was busily \"disposing of assets\". This has fuelled rumours that the one-time billionaire is now down to his last few millions, a pauper by the standards of Russia's elite. Berezovsky said he would not discuss his assets.</p> <p>As well as the elusive Abramovich, one other person was missing from the lop-sided drama: Abramovich's barrister Jonathan Sumption QC. Sumption realised early on that the key to the case was character, and convincing the judge Berezovsky was a wrong 'un. The strategy worked. He has more than earned his fee \u2013 rumoured to be in excess of \u00a31m. And what's more he is now a supreme court judge and a lord, further proof perhaps that Britain is good at delivering justice.</p>",
  "<p>Accounts of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2005/mar/24/research.highereducation2\" title=\"Guardian article on cold fusion from 2005\">cold fusion</a> claims of the Czech-born electrochemist Martin Fleischmann, who has died aged 85, and his American-French former student Stanley Pons often assert that their results could not be replicated. This implies that their original experiments, carried out at the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, in the 1980s were flawed. Cold fusion has since come to be commonly regarded as a delusion, but <a href=\"http://www.infinite-energy.com/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=10\" title=\"Charles Beaudette's book Excess Heat\">the true situation is more complicated</a>.</p> <p>The Fleischmann-Pons experiments were motivated by the idea that hydrogen fusion, the source of the sun's heat, which goes very slowly at ordinary temperatures, might go significantly faster if the nuclei involved were brought closer together, as when hydrogen is absorbed at high density in a material such as palladium. The project was more successful than anticipated: returning to the laboratory after one weekend, when the apparatus had been turned off, the pair found that so much heat had been produced that a large hole had been melted into the bench and concrete floor. As a precaution they reduced the scale of the experiment and announced their findings at a press conference in 1989.</p> <p>While the original nuclear claims appear to have been erroneous \u2013 it was not their area of expertise \u2013 the parallel claim relating to excess heat production is different. Some scientists failed to replicate this, but others were successful, notably Michael McKubre of SRI International, California. At the <a href=\"http://www.lanl.gov/about.shtml\" title=\"Los Alamos National Laboratory website\">Los Alamos National Laboratory</a>, New Mexico, a nuclear product, tritium, was detected, indicating that nuclear processes were indeed occurring.</p> <p>Fleischmann and Pons continued their efforts in France from 1992 until Fleischmann retired three years later and returned to Britain. In 2004 a <a href=\"http://lenr-canr.org/wordpress/?page_id=455\" title=\"US Department of Energy report, 2004\">US Department of Energy report</a> supported the view that the excess heat claims were valid, but had little influence on general opinion. Though the nuclear difficulties were eventually resolved, the fact that heat had been observed in excess of anything that can be explained on the basis of the usual mechanisms was neglected, or talked away.</p> <p>The fact that many who tried to reproduce the phenomenon failed should not have been considered conclusive, since phenomena in materials are sometimes difficult to reproduce. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SglvSJIlKFQ\" title=\"1999 documentary, Cold Fusion: Fire from Water\">Scientists convinced that there was a real effect</a> continued work in the area over the years in several countries, including France, Italy, the US, and Japan, often with government support. Some, hopeful that the process might ultimately become a useful source of energy, concentrated on increasing the power generated.</p> <p>Notwithstanding the criticism that he received at the end of a career that had been highly successful in many other respects, Fleischmann expected that <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oHXy1knGrM\" title=\"Lecture on YouTube by Edmund Storms\">cold fusion would eventually receive general acceptance by the scientific community</a>. His manner was calm, expressing regret at how things had worked out but little in the way of anger.</p> <p>A native of Karlovy Vary, Fleischmann escaped with his family to Britain after Nazis beat up his father, Hans, who died soon after the family emigrated. His mother, Margaret, supported the family by creating and successfully running Old Cottage Toys, a doll company.</p> <p>From Worthing high school, Martin went to study chemistry at Imperial College London, gaining his first degree in 1948 and his doctorate in 1951. His first academic posts came in Newcastle upon Tyne, initially at King's College, which was one of the bodies that in 1963 merged to form what is now Newcastle University.</p> <p>He did much to establish the discipline of electrochemical engineering at the new institution before moving to Southampton University as professor of electrochemistry (1967-77). There he played an important part in discovering the principle of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), examining metal surfaces at a molecular level.</p> <p>Research professorships followed at Southampton from 1983, and at Utah from 1988. Fleischmann was president of the International Society of Electrochemists (1970-72); was awarded the Royal Society of Chemistry's medal for electrochemistry and thermodynamics (1979); and was elected to a Fellowship of the Royal Society (1986).</p> <p>In 1993 the nuclear scientist John R Huizenga produced the book <a href=\"http://newenergytimes.com/v2/books/Reviews/HuizengaByBritz.shtml\" title=\"Brief review on the New Energy Times website\">Cold Fusion: The Scientific Fiasco of the Century</a>, one of many attacks that had the effect of kicking the subject into the long grass, and so impeding the prospects of recognition for Fleischmann's work. However, progress seems to be occurring towards the application of <a href=\"http://lenr-canr.org/\" title=\"Library of papers about cold fusion\">cold fusion</a> as a practical energy source. It may well transpire that, in the words of one cold fusion entrepreneur: \"<a href=\"http://ecatinfo.com/e-cat/rossi-the-market-will-decide-as-to-whether-or-not-the-e-cat-is-successful\" title=\"Andrea Rossi on his E-cat device\">The market will decide.</a>\"</p> <p>In 1950, Fleischmann married Sheila Flinn. She survives him, as do his son, Nicholas, and a daughter, Vanessa. Another daughter, Charlotte, died earlier this year.</p> <p>\u2022 Martin Fleischmann, electrochemist, born 29 March 1927; died 3 August 2012</p>",
  "<p>Most people know me as Latefa, an academic refugee from Algeria. But I was not born an academic, neither was I born a refugee.</p> <p>I became an academic because, as a bright, young girl, I was given the opportunity to learn and gain as much knowledge as I could. The support of my parents was backed up by post-colonial Algerian policies that provided free and equal access to higher education for all.</p> <p>After finishing my Bachelor's degree at Algiers University (<a href=\"http://www.usthb.dz/en/\" title=\"\">USTHB</a>) my career quickly progressed. I was accepted for a work placement in a research laboratory in Algiers, where I was later offered a permanent position as assistant researcher. It was there I worked, and gained a diploma equivalent to a Masters degree, until I was forced to leave the country.</p> <p>Algeria had become a different place to the country I'd known in childhood. Under the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Liberation_Front_%28Algeria%29\" title=\"\">National Liberation Front</a>, the nationalist party that came into power post-independence - and in the struggle for power between rival groups - political opponents, academics and journalists were imprisoned or <a href=\"http://www.algeria-watch.org/en/articles/1997_2000/wife.htm\" title=\"\">assassinated</a>. According to official records, some 250,000 people lost their lives, 20,000 simply 'disappeared' and millions of people were forced to exile. My husband, a journalist and vocal opponent of the rise of fundamentalism and I (viewed as a left-wing feminist for my involvement with workers' unions) were no different.</p> <p>In July 2002, following several articles by my husband criticising the government, our flat was ransacked. In December of the same year, my husband fled, seeking asylum at Heathrow Airport. After receiving death threats and strange phone calls, in June 2003, heavily pregnant and with two small children, I too left Algeria. Getting out was surprisingly easy. Staff at the British high commission were kind, processing our visas at unusual speed. I thought our nightmare has ended. But it was simply the beginning of another one.</p> <p>Following <a href=\"http://www.irr.org.uk/news/public-spending-cuts-savage-dispersal-system/\" title=\"\">UKBA dispersal policy</a>, my family was sent to Swansea in Wales, where we were accommodated in very disadvantaged area. Aside from the culture shock - having to get used to a very different quality of life - almost immediately we started experiencing hostilities and racists attacks. On several occasions the police had to intervene but it was not only 2007 we were finally moved to a better neighbourhood.</p> <p>Still, our support worker was excellent. Learning that my husband was also a poet, she passed on his works to English PEN, who <a href=\"http://www.englishpen.org/state-of-emergency/\" title=\"\">translated and published his poetry</a>. Knowing that I was a researcher, I was put in touch with Dace (<a href=\"http://www.swansea.ac.uk/dace/\" title=\"\">Department of adult continuing education</a>) at Swansea University where I enrolled on a intensive English language course. Soon, I got involved in civil society, volunteering with the Swansea Bay Asylum Seekers Support Group (SBASSG) because I was shocked by the treatment of women who sought asylum for gender-based persecution.</p> <p>Perhaps as therapy, but mostly because I needed to add theoretical understanding to my activism and personal experience, I took a part-time BA in sociology in Swansea, where I met <a href=\"http://www.swan.ac.uk/cmpr/researchassociates/\" title=\"\">professor Heaven Crawley</a>, director of the Centre for Migration and Policy Research at Swansea University, and an authority on gender and asylum. With Heaven's encouragement and support from the <a href=\"http://www.academic-refugees.org/\" title=\"\">Council for assisting refugee academics</a> (Cara), I have not only completed a Masters, but I'm currently studying for a PhD, researching the <a href=\"http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/gender/2012/06/21/legislative-elections-in-algeria-no-algerian-spring-but-a-womens-spring-instead/\" title=\"\">new Algerian women diasporas</a>.</p> <p>My success at postgraduate level made the <a href=\"http://www.welshcountry.co.uk/index.php/news-from-around-wales/232-south-east-wales/7450-former-refugee-graduates-from-swansea-university-with-msc-in-population-movements-and-policies\" title=\"\">local news</a> and my research has been called promising in both its focus and originality and is likely to make a clear contribution to the field of diaspora studies. But still, like everyone, I face challenges and think often about the irony of having left Algeria and fled persecution only to have to suffer racism. I've coped well. My husband hasn't so lucky and his health has severely deteriorated.</p> <p>In the end, civil unrest in Algeria cost me a lot: my marriage, at times my dignity (sitting in a chair for two days at Heathrow airport was a particular low point), my independence and often my happiness. But the pursuit of knowledge has been a saving grace for my children and I. As I enter into the third year of my PhD, my eldest daughter's received her GCSE results (3 A*s and 5 As) and now prepares to begin her A-levels. I am determined to finish my PhD and build my career in academia. My hope is to contribute to this county \u2013 if I'm given the opportunity.</p> <p><em>Latefa Guemar is a doctoral researcher at <a href=\"http://www.swan.ac.uk/\">Swansea University</a>.

Certainly little that Mitt Romney or Paul Ryan said lingers in the memory.</p> <p>Two moments, though, stand out. One was the extraordinarily moving tribute paid to Mitt Romney by <a href=\"http://foxnewsinsider.com/2012/08/30/video-transcript-pam-finlaysons-emotional-rnc-speech/#more-94348\">Pamela Finlayson</a>, one of his parishioners in Massachusetts. She described how the Romneys helped her family as they struggled with their premature daughter, and 26 years later were still caring. I'd have voted for Mitt if the election had been held when Finlayson finished speaking.</p> <p>The other was the powerful keynote <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/80421.html\">addresses</a> by two governors, Nikki Haley of South Carolina and Susana Martinez of New Mexico. Haley's speech was the most accomplished of the convention, but Martinez's exhibited a quiet confidence that singles her out as a future party leader. \"As the first Hispanic female governor in history, little girls often come up to me in the grocery store or the mall,\" said Martinez. \"They look and point, and when they get the courage, they ask 'Are you Susana?' and they run up and give me a hug. And I wonder: how do you know who I am?\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395815801\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/9/28/1317225418768/Annmarie_Cox.jpg\" alt=\"Ana Marie Cox\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Ana Marie Cox:</strong> My favorite convention moment was actually one of the most ordinary: I had a conversation with someone. Looking for women to talk about the GOP platform with, I found a lady who was a senior-citizen black alternate delegate from Nebraska. She single-handedly embodied half of the contradictions at the center of the 2012 contest, including the fact that she was utterly gracious and willing to spend quite a bit of time talking very reasonably about issues many want to avoid. We talked about abortion, about broken families, even about Ron Paul. After a week of being reminded at every turn of the anger at the heart of the Republican message, I hope I can keep in mind the potential for real conversation once we meet each other face-to-face.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395815802\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/4/19/1334856266547/Adam-Gabbatt-byline-pic-003.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Gabbatt byline pic\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adam Gabbatt byline pic.

These are people under 29, well educated, who believe in the Republican core of small government and lower taxes. They just happen to be homosexual.</p> <p>Unfortunately, that means that outside of groups like the Log Cabin Republicans, there isn't much of a place for them within the modern GOP. It was interesting to hear the people I spoke to put forward the idea that Republicans, as individual freedom champions, shouldn't give two hoots about what goes on behind closed doors between consenting adults. Unfortunately, the party is in such a thrall to the rightwing, God fearing base, that change is unlikely from a top down level any time soon - and while you have someone like Rick Santorum trotting around the country comparing gay sex to \"man on dog\", Republicans are unlikely to attract the kind of socially liberal members who could effect change at a grass roots level.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395815803\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/01/21/ewen_macaskill_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Ewen Macaskill\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Ewen MacAskill:</strong> There are two main contenders for moment of the week at the Republican convention: Clint Eastwood's meltdown on stage, and the star turn by former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice.</p> <p>Eastwood, though an actor, offered up a rambling, at times almost incoherent, speech. He was the 'mystery guest', the element of surprise. When he took to the stage at first, it seemed to work, his appearance dramatic, against a screen backdrop of one his most popular roles The Man With No Name. Although he was cheered throughout by convention delegate at the time, the postmortem was less charitable. He ran well over his alloted slot, throwing out the schedule, meaning Mitt Romney overshot his primetime television slot.</p> <p>Rice, though well known as a speaker at foreign policy thinktanks, was not generally regarded as a politician. She was seen as primarily academic. Along with Florida senator Marco Rubio, she turned in one of the best performances of the week. She brought to life what had until that point been a listless convention, at which delegates had been milling around, barely listening to the speakers. Her best line was that she was able to rise from segregated Alabama, unable to eat a hamburger in a Woolworth store, to become secretary of state. And one day president, perhaps?<br></p> <p><strong>MaribelleFL:</strong> I will remember Marco Rubio's speech the most. Truly the best speech. The best part ...</p> <blockquote> <p>Our problem with President Obama isn't that he's a bad person. By all accounts, he too is a good husband, and a good father \u2014 and thanks to lots of practice, a pretty good golfer. Our problem is he's a bad president.</p> <p>The new slogan for the president's campaign is \"Forward.\" A government that spends $1 trillion more than it takes in. An $800 billion stimulus that created more debt than jobs. A government intervention into health care paid for with higher taxes and cuts to Medicare. Scores of new rules and regulations.</p> <p>These ideas don't move us 'Forward', they take us backwards. These are tired and old big government ideas. Ideas that people come to America to get away from. Ideas that threaten to make America more like the rest of the world, instead of helping the world become more like America.</p> <p>Under Barack Obama, the only \"Change\" is that \"Hope\" has been hard to find.<br>Now millions of Americans are insecure about their future. But instead of inspiring us by reminding us of what makes us special, he divides us against each other. He tells Americans they're worse off because others are better off. That people got rich by making others poor. Hope and Change has become Divide and Conquer.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>TheBonsaiKid:</strong> The moment Mitt Romney said \"President Obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans and heal the planet.\" pulling a silly face and enjoying the laughs.</p> <p>The very idea of climate change dismissed as a joke unworthy of even commenting on. It just seemed to embody the detachment from reality of the whole shebang.</p> <p><strong>sbanicki: </strong>Here is what Barack Obama and the Democrats need to do at next weeks convention. They need to explain the contrast between the Democratic parties platform and the platform revealed by the Republicans last week. While doing this, major falsehoods expressed by Republicans must be addressed.</p> <p>Obama must debunk the fallacy that the country is worse off than it was four years ago. The events causing the collapse of housing and stock markets did not happen in the fall of 2008. The fall of 2008 was when the market, and thus the country, acknowledged the devastation of home values brought about by sub-prime lending throughout the first eight years of this century.</p> <p>In the normal course of banking and finance, holders of financial assets are required to establish a reserve for losses against assets acquired. When a bank makes a car loan they immediately set up a loss reserve. No lender expects a specific loan to default on the day the loan is made. However, an experienced lender knows that a certain percentage of loans made will end up in default. He just does not know which specific loans will fail.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Over to you!

  "<p><strong>(updated below)</strong></p> <p>The Obama administration's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/31/us-cia-detainee-prison-deaths\">aggressive, full-scale whitewashing of the \"war on terror\" crimes</a> committed by Bush officials is now complete. Thursday, Attorney General Eric Holder <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2012/August/12-ag-1067.html\">announced</a> the closing without charges of the only two cases under investigation relating to the US torture program: one that resulted in the 2002 death of an Afghan detainee at a secret CIA prison near Kabul, and the other the 2003 death of an Iraqi citizen while in CIA custody at Abu Ghraib. This decision, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/31/us/holder-rules-out-prosecutions-in-cia-interrogations.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=1\">says the New York Times Friday</a>, \"eliminat[es] the last possibility that any criminal charges will be brought as a result of the brutal interrogations carried out by the CIA\".</p> <p>To see what a farce this is, it is worthwhile briefly to review the timeline of how Obama officials acted to shield Bush torturers from all accountability. During his 2008 campaign for president, Obama <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/attytood/Barack_on_torture.html\">repeatedly vowed</a> that, while he opposed \"partisan witch-hunts\", he would instruct his attorney general to \"immediately review\" the evidence of criminality in these torture programs because \"nobody is above the law.\" Yet, almost immediately after winning the 2008 election, Obama, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/12/us/politics/12inquire.html?pagewanted=all\">before he was even inaugurated</a>, made clear that he was opposed to any such investigations, citing what he called \"a belief that we need to look forward as opposed to looking backwards\".</p> <p>Throughout the first several months of his presidency, his top political aides, such as the <a href=\"http://crooksandliars.com/john-amato/rahm-emanuel-sez-no-bush-officals-shoul\">chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel</a>, and his <a href=\"http://www.talkleft.com/story/2009/4/20/19221/2215\">press secretary, Robert Gibbs</a>, publicly \u2013 and inappropriately \u2013 pressured the justice department to refrain from any criminal investigations. Over and over, they repeated the Orwellian mantra that such investigations were objectionable because \"we must look forward, not backward\". As Gibbs put it in April 2009, when asked to explain Obama's opposition, \"the president is focused on looking forward. That's why.\"</p> <p>On 16 April 2009, Obama himself took the first step in formalizing the full-scale immunity he intended to bestow on all government officials involved even in the most heinous and lethal torture. On that date, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/16/AR2009041602768.html\">he decreed</a> absolute immunity for any official involved in torture provided that it comported with <a href=\"http://digbysblog.blogspot.com.br/2009/07/immunization-program-by-digby-needless.html\">the permission slips</a> produced by Bush department of justice (DOJ) lawyers which authorized certain techniques. \"This is a time for reflection, not retribution,\" the new president so movingly observed in his statement announcing this immunity. Obama added:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[N]othing will be gained by spending our time and energy laying blame for the past \u2026 we must resist the forces that divide us, and instead come together on behalf of our common future.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Note how, in Obama's new formulation, those who believed that Bush officials should be held criminally accountable for their torture crimes \u2013 should be subjected to the rule of law on equal terms with ordinary citizens \u2013 were now scorned as \"the forces that divide us\". On the same day, Holder issued his own statement arguing that \"it would be unfair to prosecute dedicated men and women working to protect America for conduct that was sanctioned in advance by the justice department.\"</p> <p>But at least this limited immunity left open the possibility of prosecuting those agents who went beyond the limits of the DOJ memos in how they tortured: in other words, those \"rogue\" torturers who used brutality and savagery beyond even what was permitted by Bush lawyers. On several occasions, Holder had flamboyantly leaked that he was horrified by what he read in certain case files about detainees who were severely injured by torture or even killed by it \u2013 there were <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2009/06/30/accountability_7/\">more than 100 detainees who died while in US custody</a> \u2013 and that he could not, in good conscience, simply sweep all of that under the rug.</p> <p>As a result, in August 2009, Holder <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/25/nation/na-interrogate-prosecutor25\">announced</a> a formal investigation to determine whether criminal charges should be brought in over 100 cases of severe detainee abuse involving \"off-the-books methods\" such as \"mock execution and threatening a prisoner with a gun and a power drill\", as well as threats that \"prisoners [would be] made to witness the sexual abuse of their relatives.\" But less than two years later, on 30 June 2011, Holder <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jun/30/nation/la-na-cia-interrogations-20110701\">announced</a> that of the more than 100 cases the justice department had reviewed, there would be no charges brought in any of them \u2013 except two.</p> <p>The only exceptions were <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43596191/ns/us_news-security/t/doj-investigate-deaths-detainees-cia-custody/\">two particularly brutal cases</a>, both of which resulted in the death of the detainee. One involved the 2002 abuse of Gul Rahman, who <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/04/06/world/main6368610.shtml\">froze to death</a> in a secret CIA prison in Afghanistan known as the \"Salt Pit\", after he was beaten, stripped, and then shackled to a cement wall in freezing temperatures. </p> <p>The other was the 2003 death of Manadel al-Jamadi at Abu Ghraib, who <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4977986\">died in CIA custody</a> after he was beaten, stripped, had cold water poured on him, and then shackled to the wall. It was al-Jamadi's ice-packed body which was infamously photographed with a smiling US Army Sgt Charles Granier standing over it giving the thumbs-up sign. </p> <p>A US military autopsy declared al-Jamadi's death a homicide due to \"blunt force trauma to the torso complicated by compromised respiration\". Autopsy photos showed \"lacerations and multiple bruises on Jamadi's feet, thighs and arms\", though \"his most significant injuries \u2013 five broken ribs \u2013 are not visible in the photos.\" A physician told NPR back in 2005:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"'How Jamadi was shackled 'makes it very difficult to breathe because you are suspended in a very awkward position. When you combine it with having the hood over your head and having broken ribs, it's fairly clear that this death was caused by asphyxia because he couldn't breathe properly.'\"</p> </blockquote> <p>So, those are the two cases which the DOJ this week announced it was closing without any charges of any kind being brought. Because the Obama administration has systematically blocked all other cases besides these two from any possibility of criminal charges, yesterday's decision means that <em>nobody</em> in the US government will pay any price for the systematic worldwide torture regime which that nation implemented and maintained for close to a decade.</p> <p>This is so despite the <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2008/06/18/41514/general-who-probed-abu-ghraib.html\">findings of General Antonio Taguba</a>, who investigated the torture regime and said that \"there is no longer any doubt as to whether the current administration has committed war crimes\" and \"the only question that remains to be answered is whether those who ordered the use of torture will be held to account.\" And it is done even in the face of <a href=\"http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2009/04/gen_barry_mccaffrey_ret_allege.html\">General Barry McCaffrey's extraordinary observation</a> that:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We tortured people unmercifully. We probably murdered dozens of them during the course of that, both the armed forces and the CIA.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jameel-jaffer\">ACLU's Jameel Jaffer</a> <a href=\"http://ggsidedocs.blogspot.com.br/2012/08/aclu-on-obama-doj-announcement.html\">yesterday said</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"That the justice department will hold no one accountable for the killing of prisoners in CIA custody is nothing short of a scandal \u2026 the decision not to file charges against individuals who tortured prisoners to death is yet another entry in what is already a shameful record.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Beyond the disgust that these events, on their own, should invoke in any decent person, there are two points worth making about all of this which really highlight just how odious all of it is.</p> <p><em>First</em>, Obama has shielded Bush torture crimes not only from criminal prosecution, but any and all forms of accountability. Obama himself <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/24/us/politics/24cong.html\">vigorously opposed and succeeded in killing even a congressional investigation</a> into the torture regime at a time when his party controlled both houses of Congress. </p> <p>Moreover, Obama's top officials, as WikiLeaks cables revealed, secretly worked with GOP operatives to coerce other countries, such as <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2010/12/wikileaks-cable-obama-quashed-torture-investigation\">Spain</a> and <a href=\"http://www.andyworthington.co.uk/2010/12/08/wikileaks-revelations-that-bush-and-obama-put-pressure-on-germany-and-spain-not-to-investigate-us-torture/\">Germany</a>, to quash their investigations into the US torture of their citizens, and <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2009/05/12/obama_101/\">issued extraordinary threats</a> to prevent British courts from disclosing any of what was done. And probably worst of all, the Obama administration aggressively shielded Bush officials <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/09/torture-case-tossed/\">even from being held accountable in civil cases</a> brought by torture victims, by invoking <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/09/08/obama_138/\">radical secrecy powers</a> and <a href=\"http://www.emptywheel.net/2011/07/21/obama-doj-doubles-down-on-presidents-ability-to-detain-us-citizens-with-no-charges/\">immunity doctrines</a> to prevent courts even from hearing those claims.</p> <p>In sum, the Obama administration has been desperate to ensure that there will be no accountability or even that meaningful investigations ever take place. That is almost certainly due to the fact that <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2009/04/24/democrats_24/\">numerous high-level members of Obama's own party</a> were so complicit in these crimes. But at least equally important is this remarkable \u2013 and, it turns out, prescient \u2013 observation from <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/13/washington/13inquire.html\">a New York Times article by Charlie Savage in December 2008</a>, on the prospect of torture investigations aimed at Bush officials:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Because every president eventually leaves office, incoming chief executives have an incentive to quash investigations into their predecessor's tenure.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>In other words, Obama is motivated to shield Bush officials from accountability for their crimes in the hope that once Obama leaves office, he, too, will be gifted identical immunity from the rule of law.</p> <p><em>Second</em>, although government torturers have now been fully protected by Obama from any accountability, those who blow the whistle on such crimes <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/06/obamas-whistleblowers-stuxnet-leaks-drones\">continue to be pursued by the same administration with unprecedented aggression</a>. As Friday's Times article on Holder's announcement pointedly notes:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"While no one has been prosecuted for the harsh interrogations, a former CIA officer who helped hunt members of al-Qaida in Pakistan and later spoke publicly about waterboarding, John C Kiriakou, is awaiting trial on criminal charges that he disclosed to journalists the identity of other CIA officers who participated in the interrogations.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Here, again, we see one of the prime precepts of American justice: high-level official who commit even the most egregious crimes are shielded from all accountability; the only real \"criminals\" are those who speak publicly about those crimes.</p> <p>When Obama first announced his intent to run for president, he vowed that \"the era of Scooter Libby justice \u2026 will be over\" \u2013 meaning high-level officials will no longer be able to break the law with impunity. In mid 2008, Holder <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2009/08/23/will-holder-s-reckoning-on-detainee-abuse-fall-flat.html\">denounced</a> Bush's illegal torture and surveillance programs as showing \"disrespect for the rule of law\", and he vowed:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We owe the American people a reckoning.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>To say those <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/attytood/At_least_not_quite_as_many_people_died_when_Obama_lied.html\">pledges have been radically violated</a> is to understate the case. Far worse, though, is that Obama officials have bolstered the warped precept at the root of so many of America's disasters: that crimes committed by and at the behest of the powerful reside above and beyond the rule of law. In so doing, they have ensured that Bush officials who authorized torture continue to <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/80451.html?hp=l3_b5\">command mainstream respectability</a>, while future leaders tempted to torture again have no reason whatsoever to refrain from doing so. </p> <p>This final act in the sorry spectacle has long been predictable, even inevitable. But that does not make it any less repellent.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p><strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong>: I was on Democracy Now this morning with Amy Goodman discussing Holder's announcement. The seven-minute segment (which also included a discussion of Clint Eastwood's spectacular stream-of-consciousness outburst at the GOP convention last night), can be seen on the player below; a transcript will be <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2012/8/31/glenn_greenwald_on_the_justice_depts\">posted here</a> a bit later in the day:</p>",
  "<p>The UK Border Agency's decision to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/aug/30/london-metropolitan-university-visa-revoked?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">withdraw London Metropolitan University's licence to accept non-EU students</a> has meant the suspension of study and threat of deportation for 2,000 international students, and financial crisis for a university already struggling to stay afloat. The agency's justification is London Met's \"systemic failure\" to account for the immigration status of its international students. But why has the survival of a university, whose raison d'\u00eatre is to educate, come to depend on its ability to control the UK's borders?</p> <p>One <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/aug/30/lmu-student-recruitment-teaching-learning?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">London Met lecturer has written anonymously claiming</a> of his institution that: \"This is not a university that is run well. The UK Border Agency basically says as much.\" Is this what higher education has come to? That people allow an agency that has nothing to do with education to judge whether or not a university is \"run well\". She/he hopes that the agency's decision will mean the elimination of those students whose English is not up to scratch. Rather than cutting them loose, the solution to students struggling with English skills, whether home or international, is to provide them with extra support \u2013 difficult of course in a climate of budget cuts, but not impossible, and my own university is testament to this.</p> <p>It is obscene that those students already in the UK at a well-established institution will be uprooted from their homes and have their legitimate expectation to complete their studies dashed.</p> <p>The agency's move has been criticised on a number of fronts, seen as part of a wider attack by the coalition government on education institutions already suffering the effects of hikes in tuition fees and cuts to public funding. A <a href=\"http://www.gopetition.com/petitions/amnesty-for-international-students-at-london-metropolit.html\" title=\"\">petition</a> calls for an amnesty for the thousands of international students whose studies have been terminated, and urges that they be allowed to complete their studies while \"the problems at London Met are addressed\". While an amnesty for these students is absolutely necessary, a fundamental perspective is missing from the debate: universities should never have been made to play the role of immigration and border control officials. The role of universities is to educate, not to police.</p> <p>The sponsorship system devised by the border agency permits universities to accept international students on to their courses on condition that they enforce immigration controls. According to the agency, the system is based on the principle that \"those who benefit most directly from migration \u2026 help to prevent the system being abused\". It seems fair to assume that the agency is alluding here to the universities reaping the economic benefits of international students through charging extortionate fees. But universities should not be in such a poorly funded condition that they have to economically exploit international students.</p> <p>Of course the true benefit brought by international students is their contribution to the creation of a multicultural environment which enriches the learning experience and expands the horizons of all on campus. But rather than welcome these students, the message from a government fixated on immigration control, spurred on by anti-immigration groups keen to blame migrants for society's ills, is to treat them as suspected scroungers or potential terrorists. Under-pressure university administrations insist lecturers police their classes to prevent those without a valid visa entering, monitor levels of \"radicalism\" among students, and take registers to record the attendance of international students even where attendance is not compulsory. Such discrimination in the classroom goes against the ethical principles and traditions of academia, sowing mistrust and corrupting the atmosphere within universities.</p> <p>How convenient then for the government that the debate over the revocation of London Met's sponsorship licence has skipped over the fundamental problem: that government policy treats international students as cash cows and turns universities and their staff into henchmen of its invidious immigration system.</p>",
  "<p>The news that London Met has been <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/aug/30/london-metropolitan-university-visa-revoked?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">stripped of its Highly Trusted Sponsor status</a> came as a surprise to some. But it's the inefficient way in which the university and UKBA have dealt with the situation that I find most shocking.</p> <p>The withdrawal of London Met's power to teach international students has been six months in the making. Yet students like me now have 60 days to find a place elsewhere, with virtually no support in place to help us. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/aug/30/london-met-university-removal-from-uk?intcmp=ILCMUSTXT9385\" title=\"\">If we don't find alternative universities, we will be deported</a>.</p> <p>To be honest, I don't mind switching schools, the facilities and organisation at London Met are poor. If I move to a different university at least I will get a better quality education.</p> <p>But the biggest problem I face is that the universities I have approached so far wont accept MBA students from London Met because of the way the university teaches and awards credits.</p> <p>My teacher called me today to say he will help me find a place elsewhere and that I will be refunded for the modules I have not yet taken. But there's a possibilty that I will have to start my course over again. And alternative universities charge around 10% more than I have paid this year, not to mention the extra costs of commuting to an alternative campus.</p> <p>The situation is upsetting and frustrating. When I applied to study here I took all the formal processes very seriously. I obtained an original IELTS diploma scoring 7.5, paid my tuition fees and was ready to learn. During the first six months of my course I attended every single class and achieved an overall mark of 70 \u2013 a distinction.</p> <p>I feel let down by both my university and the British government. They should have worked out a way to support legitimate international students before yesterday's news was made public. They didn't. It seems as if they don't care. Without doubt, future students will be put off coming to the UK.</p> <p>When I applied to London Met I hoped for a quality learning experience and great tutors. I looked forward to living in an amazing city like London. I'd heard that public services and government here were very well organised.</p> <p>Clearly UKBA found some illegal cases in the sample it took from London Met, but there are also plenty of legitimate students who came here to pursue their dream. My friends and classmates are devastated by the news, their families are shocked.</p> <p>I gave up a lot so that I could come here \u2013 I sold my apartment and took a two-year sabbatical. I planned to stay for a year and a half before returning to my country to make a new life. I now have no idea what's going to happen.</p> <p>Nor do the teachers at London Met. When I went into university yesterday staff were apologetic and depressed. I asked what would happen next, they told me to call up on Monday, they didn't have the answers yet.</p>",

  "<p>The thrill of a new series of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006q2x0\" title=\"\">Doctor Who</a> this time comes tempered with despair. Because tomorrow night, while the end of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/aug/15/doctor-who-asylum-of-the-daleks\" title=\"\">Asylum of the Daleks</a> will leave fans open-mouthed, there will also be one less adventure with the Ponds left to enjoy.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2010/mar/14/karen-gillan-doctor-who\" title=\"\">Karen Gillan</a> and Arthur Darvill leave Doctor Who at the end of this first, five-episode chunk of the new series, with Amy and Rory's fate still unclear. And, while we have grown to love Rory, the Doctor has almost always been defined by the women he travels about the universe with in non-sexual bliss \u2013 so it's time to look back on the era of The Girl Who Waited.</p> <p>It feels as though companions since the revival have found themselves described as \"feisty\" largely by virtue of being given a character. Amy was first introduced as an <em>actually</em> feisty companion; a flighty kissogram who made her grown-up debut whacking the Doctor with a baseball bat and pretending to be a police officer.</p> <p>Her choice of profession, not to mention her outfits, led the usual suspects to decry the character as \"too sexy\". But executive producer Piers Wenger was right when he called her \"feisty and outspoken and a bit of a number,\" saying that while she was probably the wildest companion the Doctor has travelled with, that didn't equate to promiscuity.</p> <p>But even that isn't the whole story. Amy is unique among companions in having had so much happen to her. More than anyone else, we have seen her develop and change. And she also is a companion of firsts: the first to have known the Doctor as a child; the first to actually jump him rather than simper at him; the first to be seen happily married. She's also the first to give birth to a murderous Timelady, and <em>absolutely</em> the first to become his mother-in-law.</p> <p>If there was a problem with Amy at first it was that she seemed a rootless collection of personality traits and enunciated sentence peaks. Plenty of people found the portrayal annoying. But that was the story \u2013 her parents had been sucked out of reality; we never got to see her at home. And that fairytale flavour <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/aug/25/doctor-who-bbc-steven-moffat?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">executive producer Steven Moffat</a> brought along made her less familiar than <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/tvandradioblog/2007/oct/01/ihopebilliepiperdoesntret\" title=\"\">Rose Tyler</a>. But as the story has gone on, she has rounded as a character in the same way Gillan has toned down her delivery. Amy is now adored \u2013 and there are not many who can bury that much emotion about the kidnap and training-as-a-weapon of their daughter .</p> <p>All the Doctor's companions are intended to \"humanise\" him \u2013 but Amy is the companion you would want to be friends with. She'll think little of risking her life battling monsters \u2013 heck, she loves it \u2013 but she'd also bawl you out for spilling her mate's pint.</p> <p>And as Amy has matured, so has Gillan's performance. Coming from the worlds of sketch shows and modelling, her timing, sass and physical comedy were bang-on, but she took time to convince with more emotional scenes. One of the heartening things about a long story arc, such as the journey of the Ponds, is that we've seen how the gang have gelled. And what Gillan comes up with in the first episode of the new series may well make you weep.</p> <p>There is already feverish speculation about how Amy and Rory will leave. And we will come to that in time. But for now, let's sit back, and think about what Mrs Pond brought to the screen.</p>",
  "<p>Between Knobel and Wien, south of the Aeolian Plain, to the west of the ditches of Cerberus, the mighty strata of Mount Sharp rise out of Gale Crater. None of these names have ever been spoken on Mars, where this photograph was taken by Nasa's Curiosity rover before it started its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/aug/28/mars-curiosity-high-resolution-pictures\" title=\"\">slow journey across the landscape</a> this week. They are names given by humans, some in the official language of scientific nomenclature, Latin, others \u2013 like Mount Sharp \u2013 more pet names for vast and remote geographical features.</p> <p>If the first vague images from Curiosity seemed pale beside <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/08/curiosity-rover-mars-nasa-sci-fi\" title=\"\">science fiction fantasies of life on Mars</a>, this high resolution (and colour-adjusted) picture of Mount Sharp is sublime and awe-inspiring. The 18th century writer <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Philosophical_Enquiry_into_the_Origin_of_Our_Ideas_of_the_Sublime_and_Beautiful\" title=\"\">Edmund Burke</a> said the glorious horror of the sublime is evoked in us by phenomena that might threaten our existence. The immense cliffs, screes and gullies of this mountain vista, set in an atmosphere too weak to sustain humans, reveal a landscape of lifeless grandeur that surely inspires such mixed emotions. It is a marvellous place that eerily mirrors the most spectacular sights on earth, from the <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/multimedia/pia16098b.html\" title=\"\">Grand Canyon</a> to the <a href=\"http://servemyworldblog.tumblr.com/image/254001254\" title=\"\">Sahara</a>.</p> <p>It is easy to see from this picture why Nasa has chosen Mount Sharp as a destination for its most sophisticated robot explorer yet. Curiosity's job is to search for evidence that Mars could have once supported life. The exposed strata that can be seen here must contain, like rock strata on earth, a rich geological history of Mars. Evidence of ancient life-supporting conditions <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/index.html\" title=\"\">may be found here if anywhere</a>.</p> <p>Yet \"rich\" may not be the word. How much chance is there of even the tiniest fossil life form being encountered by Curosity? On Earth, the remote ancient rocks of places like the Burgess Shales in Canada contain weird forms such as the early Cambrian creepy-crawly <a href=\"http://www.burgess-shale.bc.ca/\" title=\"\">Hallucigenia</a>. Go for a walk nearly anywhere and you can find fossils of some kind. You don't have to look long, in other words, to find evidence of ancient life in Earth's rocks. Meanwhile in this desolate Martian landscape a machine sent by Earth's most ambitious life forms will pick over the pebbles in search of the merest trace of the possibility of life.</p> <p>This picture is thrilling and it is terrifying. It is a mirror of Earth's rocky architecture if somehow our planet became lifeless.</p> <p>Meanwhile on Earth, Republican presidential hopeful <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/31/mitt-romney-acceptance-speech-hope\" title=\"\">Mitt Romney</a> was making the speech of his life as he launches his bid to run the world's most powerful democracy. \"President Obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans and heal the planet\", he said. \"My promise ... is to help you and your family.\"</p> <p>And that's when the scientific magnificence of this photograph turns to dread. While we gaze in wonder at a dead planet, what is happening to the living one? The start of Curiosity's mission has coincided with a summer full of danger warnings for life on earth. Suddenly, debates and pseudo-debates about climate change are ancient history. The <a href=\"http://www.themoscowtimes.com/opinion/article/arctic-melt-will-prompt-energy-rush/467374.html\" title=\"\">record melting of Arctic ice</a> this summer points clearly to ice-free summers in the Arctic in the near future. Nasa itself, not long before its Mars mission touched down, discovered startling satellite evidence of an equally dramatic <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/greenland-melt.htm\" title=\"\">melting of the ice sheet on Greenland</a>. Even <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/jul/29/climate-change-sceptics-change-mind\" title=\"\">former sceptics</a> are accepting the reality and urgency of a change in the life of the Earth caused mainly by human activity.</p> <p>Mars is a beautiful place, as this picture shows, but it is majestically dead. The universe appears to be full of places like that. What no one has so far found much trace of is a place like this: a planet that jumps with life. Earth is a miracle, quite possibly the greatest miracle in the entire cosmos. It is now proven beyond any reasonable doubt that we are playing dangerously with the very fabric of that miracle, endangering the biological balances of our amazing world. Endangering ourselves. In this picture we look on a dead world. Do those silent strata reveal the Martian past, or our future?</p>",

  "<p>The older I get the more I realise that whenever society corrects one injustice it risks creating another by what it does. Two classic examples leap out of successive pages of the Guardian on Friday, one <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/aug/31/charities-end-squatters-rights-homelessness\" title=\"\">the new law to criminalise squatting</a>, the next the fallout from the Home Office's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/aug/30/london-metropolitan-university-international-students\" title=\"\">decision to remove London Metropolitan University's licence</a> to recruit and teach students from outside the EU.</p> <p>Were those actions correcting injustices \u2013 or merely the vindictive responses of a Tory-dominated coalition to the kind of people it doesn't like, squatters and foreign students? There may be a touch of the latter in the calculation, hopes of easy applause lines at the coming Conservative conference. But the same could be said in reverse about a Labour government being a soft touch to abuses such as squatting and \u2013 especially \u2013 student visa fraud.</p> <p>We all know cases, admittedly the minority, where squatters have occupied people's homes when they've been on holiday, had the builders in or were renting it out while living somewhere else. The Daily Mail doesn't make up these stories, though it loves to print them. Councils and housing associations have been plagued with squatting problems for decades.</p> <p>It's just a lazy cliche to claim that all squats are in houses that have been empty for years or belong to rich foreigners who deserve to get their place trashed. Needy families have been deprived of a home because squatters have derailed building plans and gobbled building funds in court fees.</p> <p>But, as with the clampdown on London Met's poor visa management, a lot of innocents get hurt in the squeeze. As Owen Bowcott reports from a squat on Friday \u2013 it's here \u2013 the civil law against squatting, often painfully slow and open to manipulation, that is being reinforced from midnight by criminal sanctions in England and Wales: up to six months in jail and a fine of up to \u00a35,000.</p> <p>Right on cue, up pops David Cameron's ambitious housing minister, Grant Shapps, who may be making an elementary mistake by his high-profile tactics ahead of the government reshuffle, to say the law is \"shifting the scales back in favour of the homeowner\", a line from his draft party conference speech, I expect.</p> <p>He's right, but he may also be shifting them there scales back in favour of property spivs, useless councils and housing associations, and others for whom housing is merely a tradeable commodity, not a social necessity, the unemployed or casually employed, the recently divorced or mentally ill for whom a squat may be a temporary lifeline.</p> <p>One such example surfaced on Radio 4's Today, the same \"Katie\" whom Owen Bowcott interviewed. Though a criminal conviction would damage her career (she's a supply teacher doing an Open University course and voluntary work to improve her CV), she's ended up in a squat after leaving an abusive relationship. That experience may have given her the articulate skills to stand up to Today's John Humphrys better than many a minister.</p> <p>No, she insisted, squatting isn't denying an owner the right to use their property in the way that car theft is, because the owner can use the civil courts to get it back when they want it. Her squat is in a house that has been left empty for years, has no water or electricity and leaking roofs. \"The crime is surely leaving houses empty when there is a shortage.\"</p> <p>Even the chap from the property lobby was hard-pressed to get cross with her. As Bowcott's interviewees explain, the law is badly drafted and most squats are in empty buildings, occupied by people who are not making a political point, but just want somewhere to live in an era of rising rents. As licensed squats remind us all, they sometimes serve a useful purpose just by being there.</p> <p>Is evicting squatters live on 24/7 TV, some of whom will have political motives, and using up valuable police time in the process, really what ministers want? Plenty of viewers who know more about rising housing costs than the average minister will sympathise with the squatters \u2013 especially those as articulate and reasonable as Katie. It's divisive, the opposite of the August Olympics, and ministers are currently not very popular.</p> <p>What the housing policy shares with the student visa problem is that both mix a traditional social good \u2013 a decent roof over one's head, the chance of a good education as the path to a better future \u2013 with the commoditisation of both, property as a source of speculation, student visas as a lucrative instrument of illegal immigration for economic, not educational, purposes.</p> <p>The fact that universities face pressure in an era of cuts to raise their sources of income, not least from foreign students who pay more, only serves to underline how the state gets drawn into \u2013 or actively encourages \u2013 such commoditisation.</p> <p>It would be naive to deny that such tensions have always existed in some form or another. Asylum laws are sometimes abused, just as human rights laws designed to protect the innocent are sometimes abused by the very guilty \u2013 often with the help of rights-waving lawyers. End one abuse and the chances are that the new protection will be abused by the unscrupulous. That's life.</p> <p>I have no idea how chaotic London Met's visa procedures were. I know that ministers have closed down private colleges for bogus activity and note that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/aug/30/london-metropolitan-recruitment-offices-india\" title=\"\">the man from a private company in Delhi specialising in finding students university places in the UK, whom Helen Pidd interviewed</a> for the Guardian, acknowledged that, while his firm was only interested in genuine scholars: \"We divide the market into two categories \u2013 the university market for genuine students and the immigration market.\"</p> <p>I can't condemn the government for trying to cut down on illegal immigration at a time of rising unemployment and public spending cuts when \u2013 so a small article in the Friday Guardian notes <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/aug/30/net-immigration-falls-slightly-216000-ons\" title=\"\">\u2013 net immigration is still running in excess of 216,000 a year</a>. But 2,700 London Met students, most of them legitimate in their search for a degree, are <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/aug/30/london-met-university-removal-from-uk\" title=\"\">now anxiously scrambling to find other places</a> as a result.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 31 August 2012. The original implied that Puneet Soin, who manages the Indian office of the commercial firm Study In UK (SIUK), represented London Metropolitan University. This has been corrected. </p>",
  "<p>This summer, the London Olympics and Paralympics have showed the UK at its best \u2013 a progressive and global centre open to the world. And yet, with the announcement from the UK Border Agency that London Metropolitan University had its licence to sponsor international students revoked, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/aug/30/london-met-university-removal-from-uk\" title=\"\">thousands of young people</a> have this week come to see a very different side to our country.</p> <p>The consequences of this announcement are extremely significant. More than 2,000 international students must now find an alternative course with an alternative provider, or face having to leave the UK. Understandably, this news is terrifying for all those concerned.</p> <p>During a radio debate following the news, Damian Green, the immigration minister, criticised me for using over-emotive language. But I'm afraid it <em>is</em> a very emotive issue \u2013 and our need to support those affected cannot prevent us from criticising this decision and the way it has been handled in the strongest terms: it is ill-judged, badly timed and poorly executed. It cannot be right that international students who came to study in the UK in good faith now find themselves in this position, weeks before the start of the academic year. They should be allowed to continue their studies, as any other student would fairly expect.</p> <p>The consequences will be widely felt. International students from across the country have been expressing concerns as to whether they are indeed welcome to study in the UK for some time now \u2013 a sentiment that has developed since David Cameron announced his commitment to reduce immigration into the UK from hundreds of thousands to tens of thousands in the runup to the 2010 general election.</p> <p>Seeing international students as an easy target, successive government reforms have made international students feel unwelcome \u2013 from huge delays for in-country visa applications, to ever-rising visa application fees, and the scrapping of the post study work visa. The impact of such rhetoric is already being keenly felt \u2013 a recent National Union of Students (NUS) survey of more than 900 international students found that 40% of students would not recommend studying in the UK to a friend.</p> <p>Indeed, ONS figures of migration released on Thursday show that while immigration into the UK has fallen <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19420168\" title=\"\">by 36,000 this year, student visas have fallen by 75,000</a> \u2013 a drop of 21%. The news surrounding London Met's licence cannot fail to compound this.</p> <p>International students contribute a great deal to our country \u2013 they both establish and reflect our higher education sector's status as \"world class\", bringing new knowledge, ideas and perspectives from which UK students greatly benefit. They provide meaningful links to other countries and cultures, and undertake huge amounts of volunteering and community work. Even in the narrowest terms, at a time in which the government has imposed so much instability on the sector, international students represent huge investment into higher education. We cannot take this for granted: while our education system retains an excellent reputation as a world leader, the way in which students are treated while here cannot fail to make it a less attractive option.</p> <p>A home affairs select committee report on the work of the UK Border Agency earlier this year stated that:</p> <blockquote> \"The prime minister's aim to reduce migration from 'the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands' cannot be achieved without drastically reducing the number of people who come to study in Britain. It is likely that this would damage a strong sector of our economy and also the cultural diversity of our universities.\" </blockquote> <p>This is only becoming more apparent, most particularly at a time when our higher education sector is undergoing rapid, confused and misguided changes on all fronts. We certainly can't afford to be damaging this aspect of the university sector too.</p> <p>Damian Green can put a halt to this process by announcing that international students at London Met can finish their courses there \u2013 this is only right. The Home Office should then announce an inquiry into the process leading to this decision and the way it has been communicated. The apparent leaking of the news in the Sunday Times last weekend spread tremendous panic, and the lack of information available at the time made this far worse than it needed to be. This made a bad situation far worse.</p> <p>In the meantime, the NUS will be working as part of a taskforce \u2013 together with Universities UK, HEFCE, UKBA, London Metropolitan University and others \u2013 to help the students affected. Many are already unsure of whether they can stay in the UK at all, and we need to work together to ensure that they are fully informed and supported.</p> <p>As the Paralympics continue over the next two weeks, I hope that members of the government can reflect on the pride so many of us feel at playing host to incredible athletes from across the world. We should feel the same about the best and brightest international students who choose to study here. They are an asset to this country, and we need to better appreciate the tremendous benefits they bring.</p>",

The requirement of planes to Heathrow to land into a pre-dominant westerley wind and Heathrows location to the west of London means that a high number of planes have to low-fly over London to land. This isn't just about South West London but both North East and South East. I can imagine non-Londoners don't care but it's idiotic to have this noise-disruption over the most densely populated area of the country.<br>Whilst it may be the most expensive option the long-term best solution is for the Thames Estuary location where most noise occurs over the sea. Having this linked to London via high speed trains and Europe with the chunnel would make it accessible and as green as would be possible.<br>Why everyone has suddenly decided we're being constrained by airport capacity is beyond me... who exactly is it effecting? if it means there is a constraint on needless ecologically-damaging flying then so be it!</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17941069\">poddys</a></strong> comments:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Geographically speaking, a new airport east or northeast of London would just make it harder still for people west of London to get there. Living in Southampton I already discount Stanstead when looking for flights because of the long journey times to get there.<br>Logically, I would have thought that a new large airport somewhere around Newbury would (a) take the traffic pressure off London and (b) make the airport far more accessible for people from the South, Southwest, The Midlands and South Wales. You have the M4 running east/west from there and the A34 running north/south.<br>Building a humongous airport from scratch there, with a view to it replacing Heathrow in the future makes sense to me. Of course nobody is going to want one of the largest airports in the world on their doorstep, but starting from scratch this ought to give airport designers an opportunity to allow for the best design for terminals, parking, and access to and from the airport.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17941097\">richardofbirmingham</a></strong> adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A wider strategic approach than a londoncentric one is needed. Trade with the developing world requires a reinvigoration of the manufacturing heartlands of the north and midlands. London will continue to be the prime tourist destination of choice and financial services is likely to remain a major earner but a rebalancing is crucial if we are to continue to prosper. This implies a shift in infrastructure investment away from the south east and London, in particular. Expansion of Birmingham International Airport combined with the direct rail link into the high speed continental system which will connect the midlands and, later, the north, is a better choice. A rail stop off facility in London will meet any capacity issue especially, as many will no longer need to travel to Heathrow from other areas.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Ghana's returnees</h2> <p>Fellow returnees provided fascinating insights in response to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/26/ghana-returnees-afua-hirsch-africa\">Afua Hirsch's piece on her own experience and the trend among Ghanaians to return to Ghana to work and live</a>.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17910850\">huggahoddie</a></strong> posts:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Afua you have written my own story.

I recognise, however, your nuanced portrait of the complexities of African countries. I usually work in three or four other southern African countries for short periods of up to three weeks at a time every year and, while there are obviously similarities, there are also great differences. Zimbabwe is as different from South Africa as the UK is from France!<br>I think that the most important issue for Africa is however one that you didn't mention and that is the rural development. Africa is the continent that has the most under-utilised land and natural resources and the rest of the world is already getting hold of these reseources very rapidly! The greatest differences throughout Africa are between vibrant and rapidly growing cities and rural areas, still often deeply isolated, where subsistence agriculture often dominates and where poverty is at its worst.<br>Transition from communal to freehold land tenure systems is not the panacea for development that many, including the World Bank, seem to think it is. It is however vital that mixed land tenure systems are developed that both encourage inward investment for commercial agriculture while safeguarding land rights and access for the poor. The great issue of the next half century as African rural areas open up to the outside world, will be to ensure that rural development is equitable and benefits the poor.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17911503\">Shamboz</a></strong> writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Good article but my experience is slightly different.

I am sure you know Ghana has an existing law against allowing dual citizens to participate in elected political office.<br>Ghana and African will never reach full potential as predicted compared to our Asian colleagues who studied and lived in the West due to the specific greed, envy, and direct sabotage of the few greedy men who took over Ghana in Dec.31, 1981 in a coup, which was treason.<br>Afua, as a Diaspora returning with no interest in politics, you are Okay with them. You are no threat! Yours is one of the most honest articles I have read on Ghana and Africa. Most articles fail to mention the high unemployment rates. Great job! Wishing you all the best. Yes, there is hope but some have to get rid of the greedy leaders mindset.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17928156\">agbonowura65</a></strong> says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Thanks for a balanced and fair assessment on the whole. However, I wish you had devoted a little more space discussing the bribery and corruption in Ghana. I think that is what undermines our efforts at development. a development that will ensure social, societal, and economic justice. Corruption starts with the lowly placed public servant; the beat cop on our streets and highways and the clerk tasked with processing your documents to register a company to the top gun at the ministry who determines whether you are awarded a contract to do business with the government. I find it suffocating. Is corruption really endemic to our culture or we just lack the moral fortitude to deal with the syndrome? I was away for over 30 years and to me the major changes appear to be the increased level of corruption and the filth in Accra.</p> </blockquote> <h2>London Met University and international students</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/aug/30/london-metropolitan-university-international-students\">London Met University has lost its right to recruit and teach non-EU students</a> after the government said the institution had failed in its monitoring of its international student body. Readers were divided over the government's decision to withdraw its licence and the fate of the students affected.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/id/3274279\">ranelagh75</a></strong> says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Whilst it's extremely important to get hold of those who abuse the system and who have no intention to study in this country, this step seems a bit drastic and very poorly timed. What about those students (at least 75%, it would appear) who now need to find other courses and cope with the stress of being uprooted? What about those who are in the middle of their degree programme? What about the fees they have already paid?<br>This seems to me to be little more than 'talking tough' and using innocent students as nothing more than pawns to score a few cheap political points whilst severely impacting hundreds, if not thousands, of lives in the process.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/id/1685314\">WitNit</a></strong> adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A very disproportionate tool, but what do the UKBA care? Given the number of international students in the UK, you'd have thought that the UKBA would be sophisticated enough to time its investigation and any ensuing penalty in such a manner as not to victimise existing students, most of whom will be entirely innocent.<br>Rightwingers may crow on about immigration, but the fact is that many UK colleges depend on internatonal students for funding, which also subsidises the cost of educating local students. This cack-handed process won't serve UK plc (or UK edu) very well.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/id/3624588\">CanWeNotKnockIt</a></strong> writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Suspect the government is using LMU as a warning shot across the bows of universities across the country as this issue affects pretty much all of them.<br>But you do wonder whether a better move would have been placing LMU in some kind of special measures, enforcing managerial change along the lines of the approach to failing schools.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/id/4056835\">OutOfOptions</a></strong> has this to say:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I was involved in obtaining visas for students, academic visitors, and staff for people joining the clinical research department in which I worked and I don't think this is an out of proportion decision at all. Although, obviously, it must be awful for the individual (innocent) students involved and their UK based families (who may have jobs through their visa dependent status or be studying at a UK school).<br>The checks and controls which are required (and the associated penalties for failure to meet them) are made very clear to all institutions before they are given permission to issue Certificates of Sponsorship or Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies numbers.<br>The fact that all students (and staff) holding visas may be given just a couple of months to leave the country if serious failures are identified and permission to issue CoS/CASs removed is flagged up at every turn.<br>We always understood this and took our responsibilities seriously. We individually lived in fear of being the one who messed up and lost us our CoS/CAS issuing licence. The Academics weren't so keen (they never enjoy admin) but when you reminded them that they could do bugger all research (and lose their grants) if half their post-docs and doctoral students disappeared overnight they suddently paid attention. It's boring and it takes time but that's just tough.<br>There may be excuses for a small number of non-compliances, and the system allows for that. However, there can be no such excuses for the systematic failure to perform the most basic checks, as there seem to have been here. How can they not even be confirming English language capability? Where I worked you couldn't even be guaranteed a place on a course without a TOEFL (or equivalent) certificate showing the required minimum level.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/id/1376885\">crazyjane</a></strong> says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The problem with the license revocation is that genuine students plus academic and support staff, from library and tech to cleaners, will end up paying for what seems to be administrative failures. A bit like the banks and the people in microcosm. I know governments like to send a message pour encourager les autres but surely something could be worked out that is less disastrous and the faults better identified.<br>It also sends a very unwelcome message overseas. We might understand some of the ins and outs of the situation but I doubt many potential PG and Masters students will go into that much detail. HE is something that the UK does very well and this has long been appreciated throughout the world.

Briefly the trail coincides with the <a href=\"http://nationaltrail.co.uk/PennineWay/\">Pennine Way</a>, and it's best to make sure you keep to St Cuthbert's unless you're feeling very fit and have a bit of time to spare, as the Pennine Way ends up 270 miles further south, rather than about 25 miles to the east.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395455071\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/30/1346360286818/cuthbert_looking_back_into_Scotland.JPG\" alt=\"Cuthbert yetholm Pennine way Scotland\" width=\"448\" height=\"336\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Looking back over into Scotland from the English border</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan Sykes/PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The view back from the border is spectacular, with Trimontium and the Eildon hills hazily visible on the skyline, just above the route's starting point at Melrose. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395455072\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/30/1346360390450/Cuthbert_panorama.JPG\" alt=\"Cuthbert yetholm Pennine way Scotland\" width=\"448\" height=\"69\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A fair chunk of south eastern Scotland from where the Pennine and St Cuthbert's ways meet</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan Sykes/PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After a short unpleasant stage in an overgrown evergreen wood where there was little light, not much sign of the path and one had to beware the withered pine tree's branch, the descent towards Hethpool was a delight. Just before you get to the lovely isolated hamlet there is a hillock covered with slightly unimpressive oaks. These were apparently planted by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2010/mar/01/collingwood-trafalgar-hero?INTCMP=SRCH\">Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood</a>'s wife Sarah, who inherited Hethpool from an aunt \u2013 Collingwood's official title, after Trafalgar, was Baron Collingwood of Caldburne and Hethpoole and he planned to make Hethpool \"a place of consideration\" if he lived long enough (as well as planting more oaks).

  "<p>The American south-west has just witnessed a striking confluence of narratives. As millions of US TV-watchers popped popcorn and tucked in for the latest episode of the hit drug war drama <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_Bad\" title=\"\">Breaking Bad</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.caravanforpeace.org/caravan/\" title=\"\">Caravan for Peace drove across Texas</a> telling a different story.</p> <p>Led by famed poet and journalist Javier Sicilia, the caravan is a fleet of buses, cars and campervans travelling 8,000km across the US to show how the war on drugs is tearing Mexico apart. The goal of this journey, which includes stops in 25 American cities, is to lend a human face to an epidemic of violence that is all too often portrayed as a one-dimensional conflict between crime and law enforcement. It is an ongoing disaster that unfortunately added another collection of bodies to its dead last weekend, when Mexican authorities discovered <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/26/mexican-corpses-acapulco\" title=\"\">11 corpses along a road in Acapulco</a>.</p> <p>But it's a tough pitch. The stories being told by Sicilia and the caravan, those of the orphaned, widowed, displaced, maimed, missing and dead, are in competition with the aesthetic thrills of fictional works like Breaking Bad. While it would be unfair to frame Breaking Bad as <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/dea/\" title=\"\">DEA</a> propaganda or somehow opposed to drug policy reform, its thematic scope fits neatly into the drug warrior's rhetoric of morality and personal choice. In main protagonist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_White_%28Breaking_Bad%29\" title=\"\">Walter White</a>'s world, the meth market is occupied by Kierkegaardian anti-heroes with enough agency to decide their own fate. Indeed, his is a world where one's situation is predicated on individual choice, rather than economic determinism.</p> <p>The premise of Breaking Bad \u2013 that a middle-aged, educated white male would wilfully risk his life and the wellbeing of his family to become a crystal meth kingpin is, of course, the stuff of middle-class fantasy. The plausibility of an all-American drug empire has long given way to neoliberal market logic; <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/10/us-mexico-drugs-meth-idUSBRE84908820120510\" title=\"\">Mexican cartels</a> have taken over the meth business and are shipping in their precursor chemicals from front companies in China, Africa and Iraq, with lab labour often supplied by <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11109404\" title=\"\">abducted migrant workers</a>. It's a highly entertaining fantasy no doubt, but it's also one that crudely uses drug violence as a flat aesthetic background for its comic-book-grade character flourishes. Whether or not the war on drugs is appropriate fodder for guiltless Sunday night entertainment is a matter of personal taste, though it would be difficult to imagine a similarly cartoonish show set in the suburbs of Damascus.</p> <p>The show is not just apolitical, it's anti-political in that it absolves politics of all responsibility and puts all responsibility on the shoulders of its characters. This makes for good TV, but it ignores the systemic conditions that allow violence to continue. In a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-hip-hop-lost-the-war-on-drugs/2012/07/13/gJQAlcsJiW_story.html\" title=\"\">recent piece</a> for the Washington Post on hip-hop and the war on drugs, American essayist Tour\u00e9 wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"When its audience was black, hip-hop embraced black nationalism, Afrocentrism and social consciousness; it was rebellious and almost always anti-drug. After the audience whitened, many MCs embraced criminality and sold the image of the criminalblackman. Black nationalism was out, embodying drug dealers was in. Hip-hop could have grown into a challenge to the war on drugs but instead accepted it as a fact of life and told bluesy, or braggadocious, stories about its part in it.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>There's something similar going on in Breaking Bad. It's a form of pop-culture therapy that normalises drug violence and helps us to accept what's transpiring on the streets of Mexico and every major North American city as a naturally occurring phenomena. By ignoring the bit players of the war on drugs \u2013 those who, regardless of choice, still get sucked in and chewed up \u2013 it boils an extremely complex situation down to the sins of the individual. With the Caravan for Peace, <a href=\"http://drugpolicy.ca/2012/08/caravan-peace-dignity-justice/\" title=\"\">we have an antidote</a> to this severely distorted perspective. By touring with a group of people whose lives have been permanently damaged by circumstances beyond their control, Sicilia is offering an alternative interpretation of what the words \"drug war\" actually mean. A war that isn't really a war at all, but a cacophony of bad policies that has resulted in a relentless human rights disaster.</p> <p>It's the spectacle of America's bloody periphery brought to its doorstep. And above all, the Caravan for Peace demonstrates just how desperately we need a new narrative. One that gives equal screen time to the margins, because that's where most of those affected by drugs live and die.</p>",

  "<p>Another year, another labour dispute for the NFL, though it is fair to say that this one has prompted rather less anxiety in the commissioner's office. Where <a href=\"http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=6060915\">Roger Goodell vowed at the outset of 2011 to cut his salary to $1</a> if the league failed to reach a new agreement with its players in time to prevent a work stoppage, he has made no such bold commitment when it comes to resolving the ongoing stand-off with referees.</p> <p>To the contrary, on Wednesday the league dispatched a memo informing teams that <a href=\"http://cbssports.com/images/blogs/8-29_replacement_refs_nfl.pdf\">the beginning of the regular season would be presided over by replacement referees</a>, just as preseason has been. With officials from leading college football conferences declining to help out, that means real NFL games being placed in the hands of <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/8295812/in-nfl-lockout-referees-no-thought-safety-middle-class\">referees whose previous recent experience may be of high-school games or even the Lingerie Football League</a>. </p> <p>We have been here before, of course, replacements having been used to start a season as recently as 2001. They lasted a single week, with the league and its regular officials overcoming their differences swiftly in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in New York. This year things are expected to take a little longer. The lockout began in June, when the existing collective contract expired, and the two sides have not met since late July.</p> <p>They are far apart on a number of issues, with the league keen to increase the overall size of its pool of officials but the NFL Referees Association arguing that this would effectively mean a pay cut \u2013 as the proposed increase in their rate would not make up for the reduced number of game fees they would each receive. The union is also anxious about the NFL's plans to wind down the existing pension scheme.</p> <p>How much the absence of the regular referees will be felt remains to be seen. Certainly <a href=\"http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2012/08/18/major-blunder-by-replacement-officials-in-san-diego/\">there have been some high-profile mistakes during preseason</a> but arguably just as detrimental to the spectacle have been the subtle things. When new officials are a split-second slower in making the straightforward decisions, it quickly adds up to disrupt the flow of the game. </p> <p>DeMaurice Smith, executive director of the NFL Players Association, also raised a salient point when he noted that one of referees' primary responsibilities was to help ensure the safety of players by enforcing the correct application of the rules. At a time when the league is trying to convince the sceptics of its commitment in that area, this feels a lot like inopportune timing. </p> <p>Up to this point, the overwhelming sentiment among fans has been one of bemusement. Apathy towards preseason is such that the gaffes and blunders can be laughed off easily enough. Concern has mounted as the real games approach, but not enough to dampen the excitement at a new season. </p> <p>This, after all, promises to be a fascinating year, with bold passing offences in the ascendancy, Peyton Manning starting anew in Denver and a host of young, athletic quarterbacks bearing their team's hopes upon their shoulders. Football is back and that is all that matters. Or at least it will be, until those replacement officials blow a call that matters more.</p> <h2>AFC East</h2> <p><strong>Predicted finish: </strong> 1) New England Patriots 2) Buffalo Bills 3) New York Jets 4) Miami Dolphins</p> <p>As long as Bill Belichick is the head coach and Tom Brady the quarterback in New England, it is hard to imagine them starting a season as anything other than favourites to win the AFC East. Yes, the pass defence will remain a weak point, despite the return of Ras-I-Dowling at cornerback after a rookie season lost to injury, and yes the offensive line has looked porous in preseason. But the Patriots have won this division in eight of the last nine seasons, and there is no reason to believe they won't do so again.</p> <p>Behind them, Buffalo have the chance to make a significant step forward after transforming an area of weakness last year \u2013 their defensive line \u2013 into one of strength through the free-agent signings of ends Mario Williams and Mark Anderson. That unit would already have been upgraded simply by keeping tackle Kyle Williams healthy. New York appear primed for distractions with Tim Tebow on the roster and Mark Sanchez yet to convince of his ability to be a big-time player in this league. And <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/blog/playbook/fandom/post/_/id/10130/geography-lessons-for-ryan-tannehill\">if his appreciation of geography is anything to go by</a>, the Dolphins' rookie quarterback, Ryan Tannehill, has a lot of studying to do.</p> <h2>AFC North</h2> <p><strong>Predicted finish: </strong> 1) Pittsburgh Steelers 2) Baltimore Ravens 3) Cincinnati Bengals 4) Cleveland Browns</p> <p>You know you've got it tough when your running back is able to complain, as Baltimore's Ray Rice did earlier this summer, <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/don_banks/08/17/ray-rice/index.html\">of only ever reaching Conference Championship games rather than Super Bowls</a>. With Ray Lewis and Ed Reed returning to an enduringly brilliant defence and a relatively youthful offence at key skill positions, last year's division winners have every reason to feel good about their prospects in spite of an offensive-line reshuffle and the achilles injury suffered by Terrell Suggs.</p> <p>On the other hand, Pittsburgh matched Baltimore's 12-4 record last year, should be healthier on defence and would appear to have the more amenable schedule. It will be intriguing to see how their offence performs under new co-ordinator Todd Haley. Behind those two, Cincinnati still need to learn to beat teams with winning records. Cleveland need to learn to beat anyone at all.</p> <h2>AFC South</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395450874\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2009/11/26/1259238080735/Andre-Johnson-001.jpg\" alt=\"Andre Johnson\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Houston Texans fans show wide receiver Andre Johnson how much they love him. Photograph: Dave Einsel/AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Einsel/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Predicted finish: </strong> 1) Houston Texans 2) Tennessee Titans 3) Indianapolis Colts 4) Jacksonville Jaguars</p> <p>Defence was Houston's weak point not so long ago, yet by the end of last season Wade Phillips's unit was performing at such a high level that the Texans managed to win a playoff game with a third-string quarterback. If their starter, Matt Schaub, and his preferred target, Andre Johnson, could both just stay healthy for an entire year they could be Super Bowl contenders. Sadly that's a very big if.</p> <p>Still, with Arian Foster running the ball they should dominate a division in which Tennessee are relying on a second-year quarterback, Jake Locker, who is yet to make his first start and the Colts on a rookie, Andrew Luck. Both could go on to be great, but growing pains are to be expected. As for Jacksonville, they were supposed to be leaning on last year's league-leading rusher, Maurice Jones-Drew, but a contract hold-out means so far <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/blog/pat-kirwan/19966140/the-last-holdout-jonesdrew-plays-card-wrong-has-no-choice-but-getting-to-camp\">he hasn't even met his new head coach, much less reported for preseason training</a>.</p> <h2>AFC West</h2> <p><strong>Predicted finish: </strong> 1) Kansas City Chiefs 2) San Diego Chargers 3) Denver Broncos 4) Oakland Raiders</p> <p>This might be the toughest division to call. Partly because nobody really knows what to expect out of Peyton Manning after his lost final season in Indianapolis \u2013 or even if his body can still hold up to a full season \u2013 and partly because last year three of the four teams finished with 8-8 records while the other, Kansas City, was a game behind on 7-9. </p> <p>Each team has its strengths but also its weaknesses. Kansas City's already brilliant running game has added Peyton Hillis, but can Matt Cassel produce consistently at quarterback? San Diego's Philip Rivers is one of the best in the business, despite a down year, yet his offensive line is flimsy. Denver boast two of the best edge pass rushers in the league, but can't always stop the run. Oakland can be explosive on offence, yet too often implode on defence.</p> <p>The margins will be fine once again, and injuries will be critical. The Chiefs had rotten luck in that department last year, so perhaps they are due a break or two.</p> <p><strong>AFC Wildcards:</strong> Baltimore Ravens, Buffalo Bills</p> <p><strong>AFC Championship game:</strong> Houston Texans over New England Patriots</p> <h2>NFC East</h2> <p><strong>Predicted finish: </strong> 1) Philadelphia Eagles 2) New York Giants 3) Dallas Cowboys 4) Washington Redskins</p> <p>They might no longer have <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/blog/shutdown_corner/post/vince-young-says-the-eagles-are-going-to-be-a-dream-team?urn=nfl,wp4302\">a back-up quarterback proclaiming them the Dream Team</a>, but the Eagles undoubtedly retain a roster capable of challenging in the NFC. An offence featuring Michael Vick, LeSean McCoy and DeSean Jackson \u2013 to name but a few \u2013 will always be capable of putting up points in bunches and with an imposing defensive line rotation in place, Philadelphia plainly have the talent. Their challenge is to keep Vick on the field and stop blowing leads.</p> <p>The Giants have retained almost all of the starters from their Super Bowl-winning side of a year ago, yet that same team went 9-7 in the 2011 regular season. Both they and Dallas face tough schedules, and the Cowboys could do with having fewer <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/dallas/nfl/story/_/id/8311136/semantics-aside-dez-bryant-rules-necessary\">distractions of the sort wide receiver Dez Bryant has given them this summer</a>. Washington are hoping for a Cam Newton-esque impact from rookie quarterback Robert Griffin III, but cannot count on it.</p> <h2>NFC North</h2> <p><strong>Predicted finish: </strong> 1) Green Bay Packers 2) Detroit Lions, 3) Chicago Bears 4) Minnesota Vikings</p> <p>It will be hard for the Packers to top their regular-season performance of last year, when they won 15 games and scored 560 points \u2013 the second-most of any team in NFL history \u2013 but they won't be worried about that if they can make a rather greater impression on the playoffs. Green Bay are hoping rookie defensive linemen Jerel Worthy and Mike Daniels can improve a woeful pass rush, but even if they don't this team should still win the division comfortably.</p> <p>If the Lions can learn to stop putting themselves in holes with poor starts and even worse discipline \u2013 they racked up the second-most penalty yards of any team in the league last year \u2013 they could be great, with a strong-armed quarterback in Matthew Stafford and a talented receiving corps even outside of Calvin Johnson. Chicago are also capable of a playoff push, harbouring one of the strongest running-back tandems in the league in Matt Forte and Michael Bush. Minnesota would just be happy to have Adrian Peterson back to full health after last year's torn cruciate ligaments.</p> <h2>NFC South</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395450875\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2011/9/22/1316722345005/Cam-Newton-Carolina-Panth-007.jpg\" alt=\"Cam Newton, Carolina Panthers\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carolina Panthers will look for even more progress from Cam Newton. Photograph: Chris Keane/Reuters</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Keane/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Predicted finish: </strong> 1) New Orleans Saints 2) Carolina Panthers 3) Atlanta Falcons 4) Tampa Bay Buccaneers</p> <p>How much difference does a good head coach make? We will find out this year in New Orleans, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/mar/21/sean-payton-new-orleans-saints-suspended\">with Sean Payton suspended for the year over his team's bounty scandal</a> and his interim replacement, Joe Vitt, set to miss the first six games. The Saints remain the most talented team in the division, but you have to imagine there will be at least some negative impact on performances.</p> <p>As a consequence it could be a tight division, with Atlanta the established challenger but Carolina adding Mike Tolbert to a backfield that will be among the best in football and expecting further progress from quarterback Cam Newton after his outstanding rookie year. The Falcons have a soft schedule and an exceptional receiver pairing in Roddy White and Julio Jones. Tampa Bay are coming off a season in which they gave up a team-record 494 points and saw quarterback Josh Freeman regress badly. They would be happy just to see signs of progress under new head coach Greg Schiano.</p> <h2>NFC West</h2> <p><strong>Predicted finish: </strong> 1) San Francisco 49ers 2) St Louis Rams 3) Arizona Cardinals 4) Seattle Seahawks</p> <p>The 49ers might have been just a couple of botched punt returns away from a place in the Super Bowl last year. Although it would be hard for any team to sustain a plus-28 turnover differential, the fact that the defence has not lost any of its starters suggests it will once again be among the league's best. Quarterback Alex Smith showed he can be more than just a game manager in the playoffs, and he has new targets in Mario Manningham and rookie first-round pick AJ Jenkins.</p> <p>St Louis are not as bad as one might imagine after a two-win season, with new head coach Jeff Fisher restoring a sense of positivity to a team who had begun last year being tipped as division winners. They will not challenge San Francisco but if the offensive line can hold up and Sam Bradford benefits from the return to healthy of preferred target Danny Amendola, they can move back up to second in this division. </p> <p>Arizona and Seattle are both strong on defence, but the former's quarterback situation is a mess and the latter will be starting a rookie, Russell Wilson, behind a questionable offensive line. </p> <p><strong>NFC Wildcards:</strong> Detroit Lions, Carolina Panthers</p> <p><strong>NFC Championship game:</strong> Green Bay Packers over Philadelphia Eagles</p> <p><strong>Super Bowl XLVII:</strong> Green Bay Packers over Houston Texans</p>",
  "<p>Each week we look at two shops competing in the same sector, and review what they are offering customers: from how helpful the staff are to the best bargains on offer.</p> <p>Our review will be based on a visit to stores on the same high street, or online, so it will be just a snapshot of how the retailer is performing.</p> <p>To get a better idea of which retailers are delivering and which are falling short, we would like you to tell us about your experiences of the same shops.</p> <p>Some weeks, both stores we visit may do a good job; other weeks there will be one that stands out as being much better or worse. Your reviews will help us discover if this is a trend.</p> <p>This week, we compare supermarket giants Asda and Morrisons.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.morrisons.co.uk/\" title=\"Morrisons website\">Morrisons</a></h2> <p><strong>Background</strong> The Morrisons brand dates back to 1899, when William Morrison&#xa0;started working as an egg and butter merchant in Bradford. He expanded into market stalls in the local area and in 1958 Morrisons opened its first self-service shop in the city.</p> <p>Business boomed under the control of William's son Ken, and it purchased rival supermarket chain Safeway in 2004 in order to expand its presence in Scotland and the south of England. It currently has about 450 stores.</p> <p><strong>The visit</strong> 10.30am, 20 August, Stockton-on-Tees.</p> <p><strong>What it sells</strong> Groceries and homewares.</p> <p><strong>First impressions</strong> My eyes were immediately drawn to an amazing display of fresh fruit and vegetables on beds of ice at the front of the store, with cold mist&#xa0;sprays built into the shelves to keep the produce fresh. Around the edge of the store were counters serving fresh fish, meats, pastries and cakes, as well as a popular salad bar. There was a dedicated area for upmarket, yet competitively priced ready meals, while groceries took up most of the centre of the store and freezer aisles occupied the rear.</p> <p><strong>What were the staff like?</strong> Chatty. From the older woman at the deli counter to the young man at the tills, everyone seemed eager to have a natter.</p> <p><strong>Best bargain</strong> Four medium white baps for 32p.</p> <p><strong>What does it charge?</strong> Onions, \u00a31.05 a kg; 1l bottle of Robinsons orange squash,&#xa0;\u00a31; 400ml bottle of Head and Shoulders shampoo, \u00a34.99; PG Tips tea bags (pack of 80), \u00a32.14; 530ml bottle of Fairy Liquid, \u00a31.65 (or two for \u00a32).</p> <p><strong>Where can I pay?</strong> There were 22 tills in the store, nine of which were manned. Customers also had the option of using one of the six self-service tills or a small kiosk selling newspapers and cigarettes near the entrance.</p> <p><strong>Is loyalty rewarded?</strong> No.</p> <p><strong>Lasting impressions</strong> An impressive experience. Although not a vast superstore, this branch of Morrisons contained a good selection of products and had an excellent range of special offers, both on the end of the aisles and dotted around the store. Outside of food, it also had a children's clothing section as well as a small but solid range of household appliances and homewares.</p> <p><strong>Overall rating</strong> 8/10.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.asda.com/\" title=\"Asda website\">Asda</a></h2> <p><strong>Background</strong> Founded in Leeds in 1949, Asda has since grown into a retailing behemoth. The chain operated predominantly in the north of England until an expansion programme in the early 1990s enhanced its reach. It was bought by American retailing giant Wal-Mart in 1999 and now operates about 300 UK superstores alongside a number of smaller convenience and non-food stores.</p> <p><strong>The visit</strong> 11.45am, 20 August, Stockton-on-Tees.</p> <p><strong>What it sells</strong> Groceries, clothing and homeware.</p> <p><strong>First impressions</strong> This two-level store offered a massive range of products in a bright, airy atmosphere. The mezzanine level contained a cafe, homewares and a large clothing section, while the ground floor contained a pharmacy, home electronics and a comprehensive range of groceries.</p> <p><strong>What were the staff like?</strong> The checkout staff were quick and pleasant, with plenty more stacking shelves and fielding customer queries.</p> <p><strong>Best bargain</strong> A pack of four standard tins of Heinz tomato soup for \u00a32.</p> <p><strong>What does it charge?</strong> Onions, 90p a kg; 1l bottle of Robinsons orange squash,&#xa0;\u00a31.39; 400ml bottle of Head and Shoulders shampoo, \u00a34.98; PG Tips tea bags (pack of 80), \u00a32.14; 433ml bottle of Fairy Liquid, \u00a31.25.</p> <p><strong>Where can I pay?</strong> There were 25 standard tills, of which 11 were manned, with a further eight self-service machines and a newspaper kiosk also available.</p> <p><strong>Is loyalty rewarded?</strong> No.</p> <p><strong>Lasting impressions</strong> Asda's store was huge \u2013 perhaps too big \u2013 taking a considerable amount of time to walk around its two levels. But that allowed it to stock a vast range of products, all competitively priced against other major supermarkets \u2013 a point the in-store advertising made abundantly clear.</p> <p>While it was busy, the store remained easy to navigate thanks to the wide aisles and good signposting on the lower level. Upstairs, Asda's non-food selection was excellent, with a wide enough range of George clothing to fill a shop of its own.</p> <p><strong>Overall rating</strong> 7/10.</p> <p><strong>Adam's verdict</strong> Asda contained numerous posters detailing how much cheaper they are than other supermarkets, which generally seemed to be the case, although several products were just a penny cheaper than Morrisons and the latter came out top when it came to its special offers.</p> <p>Morrisons also outclassed Asda when it came to the range of fresh products on offer, from the impressive fruit and veg stands to the bakery and fish counter, where a dedicated fishmonger was on hand to give advice and prepare fish to order.</p> <p>Outside of food, Asda's range of clothing and electrical goods was comprehensive. This was an area where Morrisons was unable to match its rival, although a range of basic appliances and kids clothing added some variation to its store.</p> <h2>Last week</h2> <p>In the battle of the takeaway pizza retailers Domino was king, taking 46% of your votes. Rival Pizza Hut was the preferred choice of just 20% of voters, with the remainder saying they would choose another pizzeria entirely.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17876162\" title=\"Store Wars comment\">WelshPaul</a> sang the praises of a good alternative near where he lives:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Our local independent pizza takeaway offers a superb range of toppings: capers, spinach, smoked salmon, blue cheese, anchovies and parmesan to name but a few, and their prices are always at least 3/4 those of the local Dominos a few doors down. I'm baffled why so many people opt for the Americanised pizza giants, whose pizzas are often greasy montrosities (Cheese-stuffed crust? Really?).\"</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17876894\" title=\"Store Wars comment\">Slowmotion</a> spoke up for Dominos' customer service, if not the pizza:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Domino's online service is really good - you get to see how your pizza is progressing (\"ah, they've just taken it out of the oven, maybe i should get out of bed now\"), delivery is quick and the staff are really friendly. i actually detest the pizza with a passion but when you're hungry and lazy it does a great job.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17881355\" title=\"Store Wars comment\">Shuggah</a>, meanwhile, liked the food:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I would go Domino's every time. They simply taste better. Pizza Hut also pretends to be a proper restaraunt serving nice food whereas Domino's do not. Their large pepperoni passion is gloriously filthy, bad and wrong. It tastes amazing and only contains about two days worth of calories. Once a year for Domino's, never for Pizza Hut.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>However, price was a recurring theme with many people saying they didn't think either chain's fare warranted the cost.</p> <p>Let us know which of today's retailers you favour, or if you aren't a fan of either or think another offers better choice or prices.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.easypolls.net/ext/scripts/emPoll.js?p=503f7ddce4b00ec5b7e776f1\"> <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://www.easypolls.net/ext/scripts/emPoll.js?p=503f7ddce4b00ec5b7e776f1\"></script><a class=\"OPP-powered-by\" href=\"http://www.objectplanet.com/opinio/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><div style=\"font: 9px arial; color: gray;\">survey services</div></a> </figure>  <p></p>",
  "<p>Coming to this country as a refugee after escaping the Kosovo war in 1999, I never believed that I would be given the chance to meet those who made the decisions that have, in essence, changed my life.</p> <p>From a young age, through learning about the history of Kosovo and it's fight for independence, I've been taught how important it is to have positive relations between countries. This is what has fuelled my desire to study international relations at university and embark on a career in politics \u2013 an area that has interested me since the age of 12.</p> <p>I'm currently studying A Levels in government and politics, modern history, English language and law at Cardinal Newman College, in Preston.</p> <p>Having embraced my passion for politics, and my desire to enter the political work field, my politics teacher informed me about the Whitehall internship, which he believed would help my future prospects. When I found out about it my initial reaction was to find out more and apply.</p> <p>The aim of the internship, set up by the <a href=\"http://www.socialmobility.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Social Mobility Foundation</a>, is to promote social mobility and increase civil service diversity by targeting under-represented groups. It's an aim which is supported by Baroness Warsi, minister without portfolio, who showed her enthusiasm for the internship at our opening ceremony. Head of the civil service Sir Bob Kerslake, who fully supports this scheme and who I got to meet, has also spoken up about how important it is for the civil service to be diverse.</p> <p>From numerous applicants, 60 year 12 students were chosen to participate in the scheme. All of us were split across the different government departments in Whitehall. I was allocated to the Department of Communities and Local Government (DCLG) where I worked in the office of Peter Schofield, director general of neighbourhoods. The department has had heavy focus in the media in recent weeks <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/may/25/mary-portas-pilot-wolverhampton-award\" title=\"\">due to the Portas pilot scheme</a>, tackling council tax fraud as well as looking how economic growth can be increased via the regeneration of cities.</p> <p>During my time at DCLG I went to a variety of meetings, shadowing both directors and director generals who were discussing how to tackle the issue of economic growth. I was also given the chance to shadow Andrew Stunnell, parliamentary under secretary of state, at a meeting and then attend a question and answer session where I was able to find out more about minister's workloads and the type of jobs they have to complete day to day.</p> <p>Having attended these meetings and met such influential people, I gained an insiders knowledge of what it was like to work for the civil service and the pressures placed upon civil servants. Furthermore, I was also able to shadow members of DCLG's legal team and also meet litigation lawyers at the Treasury's solicitors department as well visit the supreme court. The people that I communicated with have stimulated me to widen my horizons and aim high. They were all immensely encouraging and helpful, and were always willing to answer any questions that I had.</p> <p>Being in the environment that, in the future, I would like to work in was astounding. I was able to learn more about the civil service and the different career options within it. All the information that I obtained was enormously beneficial and helped me come to the decision that I would like to become a fast streamer in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office once I have graduated.</p> <p>The experience has been overwhelming, inspiring and definitely enriching and I would recommend everyone, especially those interested in politics, to apply.</p> <p><em>Endrita Salihu is 17 and studying for her A Levels at Cardinal Newman College in Preston.

  "<p>There was a widespread feeling in the early days of such TV programmes as <em><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0071b63\">The Apprentice</a></em> and <em>Dragons' Den</em> that they might encourage more awareness that business creates jobs and prosperity, rather than being essentially an instrument of exploitation and greed.</p> <p>Culturally, the UK's entrepreneurs have had a bad deal for many years, with the heroic struggles of organised labour far more appealing than those of adventurers who may risk everything, often including second mortgages on their homes, to create an enterprise which provides jobs not just for themselves but for others.</p> <p>Alas. The treacherous requirements of the media, especially the need to entertain, have subverted original good that was done, according to a study by the<a href=\"http://www.salford.ac.uk/business-school\"> business school </a>of Salford university. The need for \"an unhealthy level of ruthlessness and arrogance\", not to succeed in business but to provide enjoyable conflict for the watching public, risks putting potential businessmen and women off.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395455287\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2012/5/18/1337376042462/The-Dragons-Den-investors-002.jpg\" alt=\"The Dragons Den investors\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dragons Den investors.

Viewers are led to believe that only certain \u2013 and not very appealing \u2013 'types' will succeed and that significant start-up capital is an essential.</p> <p>The research, focused on immigrant entrepreneurs, found that most start with:</p> <blockquote> <p>very little or no money but had a good idea, with the skills and knowledge to exploit it, plus determination and a strong work ethic.</p> </blockquote> <p>An example is Dina Railean from Moldova who took two MAs at Manchester University and started her own <a href=\"http://www.expresslanguagesolutions.com/\">translation and interpreting business</a> based in Salford, after a long struggle with visa and work permit obstacles. She says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Having experience of two different business cultures has given me an advantage in being able to spot opportunities which other people can miss, which I think is one of the key skills of an entrepreneur.</p> <p>I don't think 'reality' business TV programmes necessarily give a true portrayal of what it takes to be an entrepreneur, although they can encourage people to look at innovative ways of doing business. The Apprentice&#xa0;in particular focuses on giving candidates tasks to complete or implement rather than asking them to seek out new opportunities.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Lena Vasilieva, project manager of the study, says: </p> <blockquote> <p>We found it to be an incredibly moving experience to participate in this project. The responses from immigrant entrepreneurs we talked to were overwhelming and&#xa0;often&#xa0;very touching; we heard a multitude of interesting stories. Many told of the difficulties they had experienced in trying to establish themselves as entrepreneurs, some even encountered prejudices and isolation.<br>However, we were impressed and inspired with the drive and commitment these people had to succeed, their determination to learn new skills and new cultures, and their ability to work hard and persevere in the toughest of circumstances.</p> </blockquote> <p>The study findings have now been incorporated into a pack of learning materials designed to help immigrant entrepreneurs enhance their language, cultural, communication and business skills.

  "<p>Like the Tin Man heading for the Emerald City, Mitt Romney came to Tampa looking for a heart. It's been a long journey involving a few trips to Damascus as he ditched his moderate record and then to hell and back through the primaries. Thursday night was the final leg. His last chance to introduce himself to an American public that feels it already knows and doesn't particularly like him as a regular multi-millionaire that anyone can relate to. But wizards can perform magic not miracles.</p> <p>Romney didn't blow it. He spoke fluently. The speech was well written. He spoke with conviction. There were some good lines \u2013 one of the more scathing ran like this: \"If you felt that excitement when you voted for Barack Obama, shouldn't you feel that way now that he's President Obama?</p> <p>\"You know there's something wrong with the kind of job he's done as president when the best feeling you had was the day you voted for him.\"</p> <p>He coated his attacks on Obama with a veneer of civility that has been more evident at the convention than in Congress these past few years. Republican senate minority leader Mitch McConnell may have pledged that \"the single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president\". But Romney insisted: \"I wish President Obama had succeeded because I want America to succeed, but his promises gave way to disappointment and division.\"</p> <p>Under the circumstances it was probably the best speech he could have given. And that's the problem. He's still Mitt Romney. He's solid and business-like; deliberate and plodding. He's standing as a CEO and he talks like a CEO. He's more comfortable in front of a PowerPoint than a crowd. There's no crime in that. But when the balloons have been released and the confetti scattered there is not a lot of political mileage in it either. The audience came to its feet out of duty not spontaneity. They would love him to win but they don't love him. They never have.</p> <p>To call it an anti-climax would be to suggest there was a climax somewhere out there poised to visit the convention. There wasn't. And it was not for lack of effort.</p> <p>God knows they tried to build the day around his vulnerabilities. They brought on a couple whom Mr Romney had counselled as their son died when he was a church pastor. \"The true measure of a man is revealed in his actions during times of trouble \u2013 the quiet hospital room of a dying boy, with no camera and no reporters,\" said Ted Oparowsky before the world media. \"This is the time to make that assessment.\"</p> <p>They brought on Olympians to testify to his stewardship of the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake where he \"drew a line in the sand and said the 2002 Games would have highest standard of ethics and integrity\", said Mike Eruzione, captain of the 1980 \"Miracle on Ice\".</p> <p>Earlier in the week Romney's vice-presidential pick, Paul Ryan, joked about his playlist \u2013 but neglected to tell us a single song that was on it \u2013 and his wife, Ann, told us he could make her laugh \u2013 but shared not a single example of how, when or why.</p> <p>Not everything went according to plan. Clint Eastwood had a fictional conversation with an invisible president in an empty chair. Sandwiched between the bizarre (Eastwood) and the boring (Romney) the Florida senator, Marco Rubio, may have shone too brightly.</p> <p>But the last day was the most impressive of three exceptionally dull and flat days. They finished on a high. The problem was they started so low they barely reached sea level by the end. They oiled their tin man as best they could. But at the end of the day \u2013 and it was a long day at the end of a long week \u2013 he's still a tin man.</p> <p>\u2022 This article originally described Marco Rubio as the Florida governor. This has now been changed.</p>",
  "<p>Australian authorities say 54 people have been rescued and one body found from a boat that apparently sank while bringing 150 asylum seekers from Indonesia.</p> <p>Authorities also fear the worst for 67 asylum seekers who have not contacted family or friends since they left Indonesia on an Australia-bound boat in late June.</p> <p>In the latest incident a boat reportedly carrying 150 people sank off the main Indonesian island of Java on Wednesday. The crew of a merchant ship taking part in the search, the Liberian-flagged APL Bahrain, spotted survivors in the water early on Thursday 45 miles south-west of Java and rescued six, said Jason Clare, the Australian home affairs minister.</p> <p>The Bahrain's captain, Manuel Nistorescu, told the Fairfax Media website that the initial six rescued, all Afghan men, appeared to be in good condition and had been in the water for almost 24 hours. There were also women and children aboard the asylum-seeker boat when it sank, he said, and he saw what he believed were bodies in the water.</p> <p>Other merchant ships, Indonesian government ships and Australian military boats and planes joined the search and found more survivors.</p> <p>The Australian Maritime Safety Authority said all those rescued would be taken for treatment to Merak, 75 miles west of Jakarta.</p> <p>The emergency is the latest in a human smuggling trade in which thousands of would-be refugees from countries including Afghanistan, Iran and Sri Lanka attempt dangerous sea voyages from Indonesia to Australia.</p> <p>Australia's minority Labor party government will in September resume deportation of refugee claimants to neighbouring Naura and Papua New Guinea while they are assessed. </p> <p>But the rush is on to get in before the policy is in place. More than 1,900 people arrived in Australia in August, the highest monthly total on record. More than 9,800 asylum seekers have arrived this year, more than double the total for all of 2011.</p> <p>\"People smugglers are running a closing-down sale,\" said Clare. Asylum seekers would stop paying people smugglers $10,000 or more to transport them more 250 miles from Indonesia or Malaysia by boat if they were not guaranteed acceptance on to Australian soil, he predicted.</p> <p>A previous conservative government established the camps in Nauru and Papua New Guinea a decade ago as part of a policy that slowed boat arrivals to a trickle but was condemned by human rights groups as cruel.</p> <p>A Labor government closed the camps after winning elections in 2007, a year when only 339 asylum seekers arrived by boat. The growing numbers since then and the deaths at sea have angered many Australians.</p> <p>More than 300 people have lost their lives making the perilous journey across the Sunda Strait between Indonesia and the Australian territory of Christmas Island since December 2011. More than 90 of them died in two boat accidents that occurred within a week of each other in June.</p>"
