  "<p>Diane Taylor criticises both the coalition government for having \"maintained a consistent narrative that child detention has ended\", as well as the \"adulation\" of organisations like Citizens UK, who&#xa0;campaigned so hard for this historic&#xa0;change (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/23/britain-sill-locking-up-children\" title=\"\">Still locking up children, 24 October</a>).</p> <p>She argues that \"the government's own data relating to numbers of children detained proves this is not true\". She is not comparing like with like. We have ended child detention as&#xa0;it&#xa0;existed under Labour and as we said we would in opposition. We always argued that the immigration system would still need to deal with both exceptional cases and border cases. And&#xa0;the contrast between the new system and what existed just two years ago could not be&#xa0;starker.</p> <p>Under Labour, thousands of innocent children were locked up, often for weeks at a time. It was Citizens UK's tireless campaigning that made this an issue of public concern and then held the government's feet to the fire to end this barbaric practice and reach a solution acceptable to the communities most affected. Working together, we succeeded.</p> <p>When we first met, 30 families from Uganda alone were locked up in prison-like conditions. Today, none are. We worked together to design an alternative that has the welfare of children at its heart. Far from being a \"mixed bag\", as&#xa0;Taylor suggests, we feel that the recent HMIP report shows we have got it right. Importantly, the new measures we have taken, such as the Independent Family Returns Panel, have ensured that the vast majority of children and families can stay in their communities before returning home.</p> <p>Those who can't are accommodated in&#xa0;the new \"exceptional facility\" \u2013 Cedars, which consists of nine self-contained, family-friendly apartments and is a world away from the infamous family unit at Yarl's Wood (which was closed by the coalition government). Barnardo's provides emotional support and educational play to help families and&#xa0;children understand the process they are going through. Cedars is required because there will always be exceptional cases in which families, who the law says should be returned home, need a decent stopping off point before they can board a plane. This is a necessary part of a civilised but effective immigration system.</p> <p>Much of Taylor's argument is predicated on the use of \"ordinary immigration centres such as Tinsley House, near Gatwick\". Tinsley House is nothing of the sort. The newly refurbished facility is used for border cases. It has never been used as an \"overflow facility\" and&#xa0;never will be \u2013 not least because that is one of Barnardo's red lines.</p> <p>The fact is we have always made clear that it would still be necessary to hold some families at the border who have been refused entry. Otherwise, we would simply have no border controls for anyone with children. In these cases, every effort is made to put the family on the very next flight available. Sometimes, however, there is a short delay, and they are transferred to more family friendly facilities at Tinsley House before their flight.</p> <p>Taylor may have a different view of how the immigration system should be run and how \"detention\" is defined. But she should not accuse the government of \"doublespeak\" because what we are doing does not fit with her view. To say our system evokes \"the same concerns that existed about child detention in its previous incarnation\" is to both ignore the scandalous situation under Labour and insult those, like both of us, who campaigned for its end and are proud to&#xa0;have brought it about.</p> <p><em> </em></p>",
  "<p>Diane Taylor conveniently ignores what really matters (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/23/britain-sill-locking-up-children\" title=\"\">Still locking up children</a>, 24 October). Children of asylum seekers used to be in detention centres, sometimes for many months. They had bad facilities, and care and understanding for their plight was not there. Now, when it is decided that a family be returned to their country of origin, families with children go to the Cedars asylum centre before departure. The facilities there are of a very good standard, and the Barnardo's staff are there to give the care and attention needed for those children at this very traumatic time for them. I know, because I have been there myself, and met the workers from Barnardo's. Also, this is reflected in the HM Inspectorate of Prisons report.</p> <p>Nobody is saying that everything is perfect, and there will be an independent monitoring panel to ensure that issues are properly looked into. But the dramatic change for the children affected is one worth having.<br><strong>Suzanne Fletcher</strong><br><em>Stockton on Tees</em></p>",

But the conditions of the humans sent to catch them has had less attention.</p> <p>Late on Monday a gangmaster company which provided teams of migrant workers to dozens of large chicken farms in a chain that supplies premium free range eggs to McDonald's, Tesco, Asda and M&amp;S, \"Woodland\" eggs to Sainsbury's, and the Freedom Food and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QOR2w4H58s\" title=\"\">Happy Eggs</a> brands to leading retailers had its licence revoked with immediate effect by the Gangmaster Licensing Authority (GLA).</p> <p>The action followed a joint operation earlier this month by Kent police, the GLA and the Serious Organised Crime Agency to liberate more than 30 Lithuanian workers who are alleged to have been trafficked in to the UK. They are said to have then been kept in debt bondage, forced to work up to 17 hours a shift, bussed to farms the length of the country to catch hens through the night, sleeping for days at a time only in vans, in some weeks not paid at all, and, according to workers' testimony, kept under control by Lithuanian enforcers with threats of violence and on occasions actual physical assault.</p> <p>A 52-year-old man and a 50-year-old woman from the company, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were arrested in a dawn raid on a Grade II listed house in Kent on suspicion of human trafficking for the purposes of labour exploitation. They were later released on bail, whose terms included a ban on them contacting the workers, pending further inquiries. The gangmaster company is a member of Freedom Food, the welfare scheme licensed by the RSPCA. Six dogs, including some fighting breeds, which the migrants claim were used to intimidate them, were taken from a separate property into the care of a local branch of the RSPCA.</p> <p>The migrants, who as EU nationals are legally entitled to work in the UK, were transferred to a reception centre by the UK Human Trafficking Centre where those who wanted it were given support by the Salvation Army.</p> <p>The gangmaster business supplied workers to Noble Foods, one of the UK's largest processors of eggs and chickens. Noble is currently promoting its happy eggs on primetime television with an advert that shows its hens leaping for joy to the Olympian soundtrack of Chariots of Fire.</p> <p>The number of people being trafficked into the UK has been rising, according to a report published last week by the government's Inter-departmental Ministerial Group. Nearly a thousand suspected victims of human trafficking were referred to the National Referral mechanism in 2011, compared to just over 700 the previous year. Trafficking for labour exploitation is a significant and growing category, accounting for nearly a quarter of all cases. Extreme exploitation in the supply chain of major fast food names and leading supermarkets remains a serious problem, according to the GLA. Austerity across Europe, and retailers squeezing costs to counter inflation in food, have created the conditions for it to thrive. The GLA head of operations for the south-east, Neil Court, said exploitation among Lithuanians and other eastern Europeans appeared to be increasing, and in other cases the authority has seen a rise in organised crime, including fraud, money laundering, tax evasion and violence associated with labour abuse. The GLA has, however, had its budget for enforcement and inspection slashed by nearly one-fifth by the coalition government.</p> <p>Court said the allegations in the case involving the chicken catching gangs were \"probably some of the worst I have come across in my time at the GLA\".</p> <p>The workers said they had been charged a fee of around \u00a3350 for what they had been promised back in Lithuania were good jobs. \u00a350 a week was then deducted from their wages each week, so they were debt bonded on arrival. They allege they would be told to bring food to last five days and were then bussed around the country from job to job, from Monday to Friday, sometimes being driven for five or six hours at a time between farms before working a night shift. They were put to work without training or safety equipment, having to learn on the job how to catch four chickens in each hand before crating them. Without face masks, they found the smell and dust in the sheds was often overwhelming. They described not even knowing where they were going, but trying to find out from the GPS system at the front of the minivan. They claim they were refused toilet stops on journeys and that in between jobs they were kept for hours in the vans at roadside parking places.</p> <p>When they were brought back to their accommodation in Kent at weekends, they reported living 15 men to a small house in damp, squalid conditions. Mattresses on the floor were infested with bed bugs and fleas. They say they had \u00a340 a week deducted from their wages for the privilege of being bitten as soon as the lights were out.</p> <p>Those workers who wanted to open bank accounts or apply for national insurance numbers say they were told they couldn't and were threatened with the sack if they complained. When they were paid, it was by cheque, so they were forced to cash their wages at a local branch of the Money Shop where the charges are \u00a32.50 for registration, a \u00a33.99 flat fee for each cheque plus a 7.99% service fee, meaning that they could lose another \u00a312 from a \u00a3100 cheque.</p> <p>The most serious allegations from the workers relate to the climate of fear and violence in which they say they were kept. They have described Lithuanian enforcers used by the gangmasters to keep them under control with physical and verbal abuse. They have reported workers being beaten, punched, given black eyes and broken ribs, and then beaten again if they complained. One recalled first meeting one of the enforcers a couple of days after arriving in the UK, when the enforcer is said to have kicked the door of their house in and shouted to them that no one was getting paid that week. Others have said that their wages were withheld on several occasions for random reasons: a dirty cup left in the kitchen, or the smell of alcohol on someone's breath on a day off.</p> <p>In revoking the company's licence to operate with immediate effect, the GLA listed breaches of licence terms on an unprecedented scale. The gangmaster has the right of appeal.</p> <p>At the gangmasters' period property when the Guardian accompanied police on their raid, several luxury vehicles were parked in front of a green oak barn. A top-of-the-range motor home sat alongside two new Range Rovers. A decorative wooden shelter next to the gate was stocked with eggs for sale in free range and Freedom Food boxes with an \"honesty box\" in which passersby could post the money for them.</p> <p>The labour-providing business supplied workers to Noble Foods, which contracts farmers to produce premium high welfare eggs which it then packs at a rate of 4m a day and supplies to McDonald's and the leading retailers. It specialises in brands and products which claim to meet high ethical standards. Its own brands include The Happy Egg Company, GoldenLay Omega 3 Free Range Eggs, Big and Fresh, Free Range Egg for Soldiers and Gu puddings. On its website it claims: \"Concern for bird welfare runs throughout Noble's activities. The care with which we handle day old chicks is matched by our treatment of hens at the end of their laying life. Utilising a widespread Freedom Food approved national catching and collection network, our dedicated fleet of GPS tracked modular collection vehicles deliver directly into our abattoir and butchery operation.\"</p> <p>Processors typically take responsibility for contracting labour to catch chickens for immunisation, for transferring to different sheds as they grow or for slaughter.</p> <p>When asked what measures it took to ensure standards for workers as opposed to the hens in its supply chain, it said in a statement: \"Noble Foods is one of many companies within the poultry industry that has used [this gangmaster]. After being notified of the action taken by Kent police we immediately ceased using this organisation. As the police investigation is ongoing it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.\"</p> <p>The Guardian asked the gangmasters to comment on the allegations but they too declined because of the police investigation.</p> <p>McDonald's also declined to comment and referred us to Noble Foods. A Tesco spokesperson said: \"As a founder member of the Ethical Trading Initiative, we are committed to decent working conditions on all the farms and factories in our supply chain. These allegations are clearly shocking. We will continue to work closely with the GLA, our suppliers and others to ensure good practice throughout the sector.\" The other retailers also said that they took the allegations very seriously and were co-operating with the enforcement agencies.</p> <p>The RSPCA's Freedom Food company said individual licence holders were responsible for ensuring animal welfare. There are no specific labour standards in its licence terms, but where a member does anything which would bring Freedom Food or the RSPCA into disrepute then the membership agreement makes provision for suspending or cancelling a business's membership. \"Should these shocking allegations regarding workers prove to be true then Freedom Food would enact this provision,\" it said.</p>",

  "<p>Mark Clattenburg has long cut a precocious figure; in the best and worst senses of the word. First seen running the line in the rough, tough Northern League at the age of 18, he became a Football League referee at a then unprecedented 25 and made the prestigious Fifa list shortly after his 30th birthday.</p> <p>Still only 37 and now ranked among the world's foremost officials, Clattenburg openly enjoys the trappings of success. He has embraced the 21st century's \"look at me\" celebrity culture to the extent that, with his love of expensive sports cars, designer labels and artfully applied hair gel, he could easily be confused with the Premier League footballers he is paid to control.</p> <p>Born in Consett, County Durham, and brought up in the Northumberland town of Cramlington, Clattenburg is a Newcastle United fan whose allegiance prevents him from officiating at their matches. One of his proudest moments came six years ago when he refereed Alan Shearer's testimonial. It was the sort of occasion the schoolboy who had taken up officiating to earn his Duke of Edinburgh's Award and the young man who qualified as an electrician in the days before professional referees existed could barely have dreamt of.</p> <p>In recent years Clattenburg's \"matey\" refereeing style has, on occasion, created on-field sparks. Sometimes his casual, chatty approach towards the game's multimillionaire players works superbly, at others it raises hackles among a breed known for their sensitivity to being \"dis-respected\" and, on Sunday, it left him fighting to save his career.</p> <p>The truth or otherwise of accusations that Clattenburg aimed a racist insult at Chelsea's Mikel John Obi during Manchester United's 3-2 win at Stamford Bridge remains unknown but despite the staunch support of the referees' union, he is facing the most severe crisis of his professional life.</p> <p>Although very different from previous traumas, it is far from the first upheaval he has confronted in recent years. The divorced father of a young son, his private life has not always run smoothly while his stewardship of two electrical companies was beset by financial difficulties.</p> <p>Almost four years ago Clattenburg made headlines when his \u00a340,000 Black Porsche Boxster was vandalised outside his smart apartment in Lanesbrough Court, a gated complex in the affluent Newcastle suburb of Gosforth. A former girlfriend and business partner of the referee was subsequently arrested and questioned by police in connection with the incident.</p> <p>Earlier in 2008 he had been sacked by the Professional Game Match Officials board pending a probe into his business affairs following allegations that he owed \u00a360,000 as a result of a failed venture as the co-owner of an electrical company.</p> <p>In February 2009 Clattenburg was reinstated as a Select Group Referee on appeal but suspended for eight months from 6 August 2008 \u2013 the date of his original ban \u2013 for \"issues relating to his private and business affairs\". The Newcastle Evening Chronicle reported that Clattenburg's suspension was related partly to anonymous allegations of gambling, domestic violence and drug taking relayed to a senior PGMO official in an unsigned letter. Although the referee vehemently denied the claims, the governing body was duty bound to investigate complaints it has consistently refused to comment on.</p> <p>Mark Hughes was one of a number of managers who welcomed Clattenburg back saying he was a \"good referee\" and the game \"needed\" men of his talent but in December 2009 Hughes, then in charge of Manchester City, at least temporarily changed his mind. The Welshman was left furious after accusing Clattenburg of asking the City bench \"How do you work with Craig Bellamy all week?\" in a game against Bolton during which he sent the forward off for a second yellow card offence.</p> <p>In 2007 Clattenburg's judgment had been called, similarly, into question when, during a Merseyside derby, he seemed poised to issue Everton's Tony Hibbert with a yellow card before producing a red following a brief discussion with Liverpool's Steven Gerrard. Later in the game he failed to dismiss Liverpool's Dirk Kuyt for a two-footed waist-high lunge. He did not take charge of another match involving Everton until earlier this year and has yet to reappear at Goodison Park.</p> <p>Like every referee, Clattenburg has made his fair share of controversial decisions and there have, inevitably, been mistakes. Overall, though, a man dubbed \"absolutely fantastic\" by the Leeds United manager Neil Warnock \u2013 normally a scourge of match officials \u2013 has got far more decisions right than wrong.</p> <p>Identified as a high flyer by Fifa, he has been widely expected to be the English referring representative at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. At the London Olympics Clattenburg refereed the final between Brazil and Mexico, with his performance impressing Fifa and confirming PGMO's opinion that he ranks as one of their brightest talents. Whether or not he can emerge from the shadow cast by Chelsea's allegations remains to be seen.</p>",
  "<p>Tracey Owings is fighting hard to keep the home that has been in his family for 34 years. In 2000 his mother refinanced. In 2006 she died. In 2009 he lost his job and had no paid work for nine months. He fell behind with the mortgage. The bank moved to foreclose on the house. Gradually the work came back. Less than before. Much less. But just enough. The house is not in negative equity and now he can make the payments. But he can't get the bank to take his money. Attempts to modify the loan and take advantage of a settlement, brokered by the White House, between mortgage companies and the justice department have come to nought. \"I don't qualify,\" he says with exasperation detailing both his efforts to meet each bureaucratic challenge and his frustration at each bureaucratic obstacle.</p> <p>He stands in the waiting room of Gulfcoast Legal Services offices in Sarasota with an armful of documents and a belly full of bile. \"They have failed me,\" he says. \"Obama came in offering hope and change but he's failed.

Does he think Romney will improve his lot? \"I'm willing to try anything at this point,\" he says.</p> <p>There is nothing more vexing to liberals than poor Republicans. Their very existence rankles.

To many liberals these are turkeys voting for Christmas or lemmings off for a leap; the condemned tying the noose for their own execution.</p> <p>At times the contradictions are striking. In August 2009, when opponents of Obamacare were disrupting town hall meetings with claims of death panels, Kenneth Gladney and other members of St Louis tea party got into a fight with Democrats at a public meeting. He had to go to the emergency room with injuries to his knee, back, elbow, shoulder and face and ended up in a wheelchair. It turned out Gladney, <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2009/08/10/55408/gladney-uninsured/?mobile=nc\">who had recently been laid off</a>, had no health insurance. He appealed for donations.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/02/12/us/entitlement-map.html?ref=us\">Trace a map</a> highlighting government dependency and those most reliant on benefits live in Republican states and often Republican counties. In Floyd county in Eastern Kentucky, 40% of the income comes from the government. In 2008 Floyd, where almost 20% live below the poverty line and the median income is almost 20% lower than the country, voted for McCain \u2013 a 27 point swing against the Democrats and the first victory for Republicans in living memory.</p> <p>\"We're getting more and more \u00adpeople coming here as time goes by,\" Tom Price, who helps administer a food bank for the local church <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2010/jan/16/gary-younge-obama-first-year\">told me when I visited</a> just a year after Obama was elected. \"The bottom's just fallen out of it all \u2026 Is there a direct correlation [between Obama's victory and the region's bad times]?

The first thing to note is that <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/polls/#val=USP00p1\">most of them don't</a>. In 2008 73% of those who earned less than $15,000, 60% of those who earned between $15,000 and $30,000, and 55% of those who earned between $30,000 and $50,000 <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/154559/US-Presidential-Election-Center.aspx\">voted for Obama</a>. This year 57% of those earning less than $36,000 plan to vote Democrat as do 50% of those with a high school diploma or less. Even in deeply conservative Mississippi the overwhelming majority of the poor voted for Obama.</p> <p>Most of the clients I met in Sarasota's Gulf Coast legal centre struggling with the threat of repossession or foreclosure voted for Obama and will do so again. \"I'm for Obama all the way,\" says Betty-Jean Haines, the fate of whose home currently rests in the courts. \"He really wants to do something good but he's running into so many road blocks.\"</p> <p>The question of why poor people vote Republican is not simply an issue of income but primarily race and partly region and gender. Poor people may be more likely to vote Democrat; poor white people are not. In 2008 McCain won a slim majority (51%) of white Americans who earn less than $50,000 (this is just below the national median income which is not poor but the only figure available from exit polls that breaks down votes down by race and income), while Obama won a whopping majority of non-whites in the same category (86%). Asked in May which candidate would do more to advance their <a href=\" http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/romney-holds-key-advantages-among-financially-struggling-white-voters/2012/05/24/gJQACxPgoU_story.html\">family's economic interests</a> middle-class white voters who say they are struggling to maintain their financial positions gave Romney a 26 point lead over Obama.</p> <p>But that support is less pronounced among white women than white men and is not uniform across the country. In Mississippi 84% of whites who earn below $50,000 backed McCain: in Vermont 70% in the same category voted for Obama. Of the nine states that backed Obama in 2008 in three less affluent whites went for McCain, in five they backed Obama and one was a tie. In all of them non-whites voted Democrat.</p> <p>\"In Republican states, rich and poor have similar views on social issues,\" wrote Andrew Gelman, Lake Kenworthy and Yu-Sung Su in a paper, Income inequality and partisan voting in the United States, in the Social Science Quarterly. \"But in Democratic states, the rich are quite a bit more socially liberal than the poor. Factors such as religion and education result in a less clear pattern of class-based voting than we might expect based on income in- equality alone.\"</p> <p>The fact that race is a factor does not necessarily follow that racism is the driving force (more of that later) or that Obama's race is the principle motivating force. Things are more complicated than that. Gladney, for example, was black while many of the trade unionists he confronted were white. Race is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/09/us-most-racially-polarised-election-white\">so deeply embedded</a> in American history and culture that to talk of where politics ends and race begins sets up a false dichotomy. Since the end of the second world war Democrats have only once (in 1964) won the presidency with a majority of the white vote. A far higher percentage and number of whites voted for Obama than voted for Kerry.</p> <p>On some level explaining why poorer whites would vote for the Republicans demands a resource sorely lacking in American political culture at present \u2013 particularly during election time: empathy. There are <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/may/25/poor-white-voters-reject-democrats\">more to \"interests\"</a> than just the economic. If someone's core conviction is that abortion is murder or gay marriage is wrong then their decision to vote for a candidate who is against abortion or gay marriage is not an act of delusion but conviction. In any case working class white voters who <a href=\"http://publicreligion.org/2012/09/abortion-and-vote-choice-among-the-white-working-class/\">are against abortion</a> are significantly more likely to vote Democrat than their more affluent counterparts. So the economy still matters.</p> <p>But it is not the only consideration. In 2008 Obama won narrowly among people who earn $200,000 or more. Given his plans to tax high earners more heavily many of them were voting against their economic interests as do Warren Buffett, George Soros and all of Obama's wealthy funders. If poor states voting Republican is a paradox then the fact that 9 out of 10 states with the highest median income vote Democrat is no less so.</p> <p>Moreover some people, despite being poor, legitimately believe in free market and small government, even if it doesn't benefit them in precisely the same way that wealthy people may favour greater government intervention even if it doesn't benefit them. This partly describes the position of Mark Weaver,<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/16/colorado-working-poor-elections-2012\"> whom I met in Fort Collins, Colorado</a>, a few weeks ago. Weaver had been the chairman of Loveland chamber of commerce and effectively lobbied for the business community of northern Colorado. He was a registered Republican and evangelical Christian who lost his job and found himself visiting a food bank and now works at a book store where he makes $9 just so that he can get the healthcare benefits for his family. He changed his registration to independent on polling day.</p> <p>His political views are eclectic. He is for gun control and a more humane immigration policy and thinks unions are dinosaurs and is against abortion \u2013 thinks its preferable to get rid of it by changing peoples' hearts than the law.</p> <p>He doesn't like Romney and said he thought the 47% remarks merely confirmed his believe the Republican candidate was a snob. \"It doesn't surprise me about Romney because he's always struck me as a stuffed shirt. He's arrogant, and it's hard for me to get past that. It didn't change my mind about him because I always thought that about him.\" But when we met \u2013 a few hours before the first debate \u2013 he was still considering voting for him because he's concerned about deficit and thought Romney might do a better job. One could argue about whether his assessment of Romney's deficit-cutting plans are plausible. But one can't reasonably insist it wasn't a considered viewpoint.</p> <p>Finally, as Weaver's circumstances illustrate, poverty is not necessarily a permanent state. People fall in and climb out of it. Americans are particularly reluctant to describe themselves as even working class let alone poor. A Pew survey in 2008 revealed that 91% believe they are either middle class, upper-middle class or lower-middle class. Relatively few claim to be working class or upper class, intimating more of a cultural aspiration than an economic relationship. Amy Pezzani, the executive director of the Larimer county food bank in Colorado, explained that politicians are reluctant to refer to \"the poor\" and \"poverty\" because it turns low-income voters off. \"People who find themselves in these situations don't want to consider themselves poor. They're more likely to refer to themselves as the 'struggling middle class'.</p> <h2>'They say they want less help for themselves'</h2> <p>In<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/us/even-critics-of-safety-net-increasingly-depend-on-it.html\"> a report from Minnesota</a> earlier this year the New York Times examined the growing number of people who were simultaneously dependent on government aid and against more government spending. \"Many people say they are angry because the government is wasting money and giving money to people who do not deserve it,\" it concluded. \"But more than that, they say they want to reduce the role of government in their own lives. They are frustrated that they need help, feel guilty for taking it and resent the government for providing it. They say they want less help for themselves; less help in caring for relatives; less assistance when they reach old age.\"</p> <p>In a country where social mobility is assumed \u2013 even if it has in fact stalled \u2013 and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/apr/14/uselections2008.barackobama\">class consciousness</a> is week the poor may vote in the interests of an imagined, but not necessarily imaginary future, rather than solidarity based on shared economic hardships. A Gallup poll in 2005 showed that while only 2% of Americans described themselves as \"rich\", 31% thought it very likely or somewhat likely they would \"ever be rich\". No doubt that figure will have dropped since the crisis but it doubtless remains high.</p> <p>Indeed, so polarised is the nation's politics that <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/d59da0f2-1a41-11e2-9922-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2AN3o6jzv\">a recent poll from the Pew</a> research centre revealed that people's views on their financial situation are shaped by their partisan affiliation rather than the other way around. The survey showed show 55% of Republicans say their household finances are in worse shape than in December 2007 compared with only 40% of Democrats even if Republicans feel they are faring better financially than Democrats. \"People bring their own views of the president and partisan identification to these questions,\" Pew's Kim Parker told the Financial Times.</p> <p>In fact, the truly shocking thing about income and voting patterns in the US isn't the number of poor people who vote Republican but<a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Voter_Turnout_by_Income,_2008_US_Presidential_Election.png\"> the number who don't vote at all</a>. Inequality in income is intimately related to inequality in turnout. In 2008, 41% of voters who earn less than $10,000 voted; among those who earn more than $150,000 the figure was 78%. One can only assume that many poor people do not feel they have anyone to vote for. Shortly before the 2004 election <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/jul/26/uselections2004.usa6\">I met Cynthia Huntington in Maine</a>. She was 60 then and had a hernia, no health insurance and was in extreme discomfort. She was in two minds as to whether to vote Democrat (Maine could have been a swing state at the time) or for third party candidate Ralph Nader. \"They don't give a shit about us,\" she said. \"They're all rich people, and they're all run by corporations. They don't care about the fact that I need surgery and can't pay for it.\"</p> <p>\"You want to let Bush back in and make things even worse,\" asked her friend Gladys Pollard. \"Worse than what?\" asked Huntington. \"Kerry's not going to get me my operation.\"</p> <p>She did, eventually, vote for Kerry.</p> <p>When liberals depict the existence of poor white Republicans as an expression of mass idiocy and false consciousness they not only disparage poor white people, they provide conservatives with one of their key talking points which is that liberals are elitists who look down on poorer whites. The condescension is reminiscent of the musings of Ignatius J Reilly, the hapless protagonist of John Kennedy Toole's A Confederacy of Dunces, regarding African Americans apparent conservatism.</p> <p>\"In a sense I have always felt something of a kinship with the coloured race because its position is the same as mine. We both exist outside the inner realm of American society. Of course, my exile is voluntary. However, it is apparent that many of the Negroes wish to become active members of the American middle class. I cannot imagine why. I must admit that this desire on their part leads me to question their value judgements. However if they wish to join the bourgeoisie, it is really none of my business. They may seal their own doom.\"</p> <p>All that said, there are still some basic facts to contend with that do suggest many Republican voters believe things that are either misinformed or absurd or both. Since the last election the number of Republicans who believe Obama is a Muslim has doubled; in 2010 a poll showed that about two-thirds of Republicans either believe or are not sure that Obama is \"a racist who hates white people\", and more than half believe or are not sure that he was not born in the US and that he wants the terrorists to win. Earlier this year <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/security/2012/06/21/504201/poll-republicans-iraq-wmd/?mobile=nc\">a Dartmouth poll revealed</a> that 63% of Republicans still believe Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. A poll last year revealed that <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/content/slate/blogs/weigel/2011/03/15/only_25_percent_of_republicans_think_acorn_will_rig_2012_election.html\">a quarter of Republicans</a> believed a community rights organisation called Acorn would try to steal the election for Barack Obama, while 31% weren't sure whether it would or not. There was precious little chance of that, because Acorn no longer existed at that stage. It was defunded and disbanded after a successful sting operation by conservatives a few years earlier.</p> <p>Where breakdowns of these falsehoods exist those with less education are more likely to believe them. But even assuming they are evenly spread among poor and rich alike it would be fair to say that a significant number of Americans are working off faulty facts that would affect their vote. After all, if Obama really did want terrorists to win, hated white people and stole the election then it would be logical not to vote for him regardless of your race and income.</p> <p>Furthermore, most of these explanations regarding deeply held religious beliefs, class aspiration and political philosophy are no less of non whites than whites. Blacks and Latinos are both poorer and more religious than the nation at large and vote overwhelmingly Democrat. While racism may not be the primary motivating force behind poorer whites tendency to vote Republican it is certainly a factor.</p> <p>\"I voted for McCain,\" says Price in Kentucky's Floyd county as he snatched a cigarette outside the food bank. \"Because, well I voted for the old white guy. At least he's American.\" A few days earlier, the chairman of the Republican party in Jackson County, Arkansas, insisted electing Obama is destroying America in the same way electing Nelson Mandela destroyed South Africa. \"Handing it over to the wrong people.\"</p> <p>In Las Vegas shortly before the 2010 mid-terms I <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2010/oct/29/younge-america-great-divide\">met a woman protesting illegal immigration</a> outside an Obama event who was voting for the tea party candidate Sharon Angle. When it turned out she didn't have health care I asked her if that wouldn't be a reason for her to support Obama. \"I haven't really gotten into the whole Obamacare thing,\" she said. \"To be honest I can't even think about that right now. I'm so concentrated on the illegals.\"</p>",

Subway tunnels have been flooded and public transport is at a standstill, schooling is shut down and many parts of the cities remain under water. There has been further damage elsewhere.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>More than 10 deaths have been reported</strong> across the 13 states most directly affected \u2013 the toll is still being counted \u2013 and more than 6.5m electricity customers are said to be without power.</p> <p>\u2022 Amid the emergency, a <strong>hospital in New York was forced to evacuate more than 200 patients</strong> when the main power supply and then backup systems failed, leaving some critically ill people on battery-powered life support.</p> <p>\u2022 A <strong>crew member from the replica tall ship HMS Bounty died</strong> when the crew had to abandon ship off the coast of North Carolina. The captain remains missing \u2013 the other 14 people were pulled to safety from the sea in a dramatic coast guard rescue operation that braved treacherous conditions.</p> <p>\u2022 Sandy had already <strong>left a trail of destruction through the Caribbean</strong>, killing at least 69 people in countries like Haiti that may struggle to cope with the aftermath.</p> <p>\u2022 The day ahead is expected to bring <strong>accounts of heavy snowfall in some states</strong> \u2013 one of the surprise effects of a storm system like Sandy.</p> <p>Thanks \u2013 that\u2019s all from me.

Those cases were not officially deemed storm-related because the counties' coroners hadn't issued reports citing causes of death.</p> <p>The first storm-related death was confirmed in Lancaster County. On Sunday, an elderly man was trimming a tree in Rapho Township in preparation for the storm when a limb broke and he fell to the ground, sustaining multiple injuries.</p> <p>Statewide, more than 1.2 million electric customers lost power by early Tuesday.

Here's an excerpt from his story:</p>  <blockquote> <p>As the United States braced for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/hurricane-sandy\">hurricane Sandy</a>, the Caribbean nations that have already faced its fury were burying the dead, finding shelter for the homeless and counting the economic cost of the fiercest winds and rain that many have seen in a decade.</p> <p>Hardest hit is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/haiti\">Haiti</a>. Although not directly in the path of the hurricane, the poorest nation in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/americas\">Americas</a> has confirmed 52 dead and at least a dozen more missing as flimsy buildings were engulfed in mudslides or swept out to sea by flood tides.</p> <p>A worse humanitarian disaster could follow. According to the government in Port-au-Prince, about 200,000 people are homeless, though emergency shelter has only been provided for 17,000.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/cuba\">Cuba</a> is also picking up the pieces after extensive loss of life and economic impacts. The Communist party newspaper Granma reported 11 dead and damage to 137,000 homes. It said recovery would take years.</p> <p>Smaller scale fatalities and damage were also reported in Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and the Bahamas, where sea waters surged over coastal barriers to deluge roads and buildings.</p> <p>Venezuela has been among the first to respond to the calls for assistance, providing food, drinking water and equipment to Haiti and Cuba.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-508f665495cb55519dae8b3a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-30T05:32:05.003Z\">5.32am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As many as 11 people have died in the US and Canada as a result of Sandy, according to reports.

Massachusetts police said one man was killed in Peabody in an accident related to the bad weather. Toronto police also recorded one death, a woman hit by flying debris.</p> </blockquote>  <p>As far as Con Ed denying that its workers were trapped in a power station: Reuters is sticking by its story and one of the workers apparently taken by lifeboat to safety doesn't seem in much doubt about what happened:</p>  <blockquote> <p>In lower Manhattan, firefighters used inflatable orange boats to rescue utility workers trapped for three hours by rising floodwaters inside a power substation. One of the Con Ed workers pulled from the floodwater, Angelo Amato, said he was part of a crew who had offered to work through the storm. <br>\"This is what happens when you volunteer,\" he said.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-30T05:35:16.957Z\">at 5.35am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-508f636a95cb55519dae8b39\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-30T05:19:38.903Z\">5.19am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Power off for a week in Manhattan?

The creek remains within safe levels and there is backup power in case a shutdown is required but this would only happen in the most extreme circumstances.

Even if the water rises that high, the plant can turn to a backup method to cool spent fuel rods. Because the plant has been shut down for a week for scheduled maintenance, there's also much less to be cooled. And if things get really bad, they could shut off the reactor all together - though Sheehan says there's no reason to do so yet.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-30T04:10:21.224Z\">at 4.10am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-508f4d87b5792d0b94e6ea77\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-30T03:46:15.698Z\">3.46am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It's Warren Murray here, taking over from Adam Gabbatt.

Nevertheless, there were a handful of people who were testing themselves against the conditions at around 3pm, despite gusts strong enough to send passersby into a light trot. Many were sent scampering, however, when a prolonged windy spell brought down several large branches from the park's trees.</p> <p>Driving through Manhattan early signs of damage are becoming apparent. In Soho police closed off a section of Broadway where it appeared scaffolding had fallen from a building, some of the debris littering the road. On a parallel street police dinghies were stacked in a trailer, the NYPD clearly preparing for worst case scenarios. The streets are largely deserted, save for police cars and a few taxis. A few people are out braving the wind, including many dog walkers, while the number of people carrying around umbrellas that have been blown inside out is unusually high.</p> <p>The promenade at Battery Park was flooded at high tide this morning and is particularly vulnerable to a storm surge at high tide this evening. TV news crews are gathered at this southern tip of Manhattan, cameras pointed out to the New York harbor, where the Statue of Liberty can only just be seen through the spray, rain and wind. Just as at the East River, the park is closed, although journalists are allowed to remain at their own risk. Expect to see plenty of pictures of water flooding into the area later tonight.</p> </blockquote> <p>Watch also this video that Adam filmed with<strong> Laurence Topham</strong> behind the lens.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/oct/29/hurricane-sandy-battery-park-weather-video\"                                data-show-ads=\"true\"                        data-video-name=\"Hurricane Sandy: the view from Battery Park in New York - video\"                        > <object width=\"460\" height=\"307\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"></param><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/video/embed\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><param name=\"flashvars\" value=\"endpoint=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/oct/29/hurricane-sandy-battery-park-weather-video/json\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/video/embed\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" flashvars=\"endpoint=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/oct/29/hurricane-sandy-battery-park-weather-video/json\" wmode=\"opaque\"></embed></object> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-29T23:00:34.431Z\">at 11.00pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-508f05f3b5792d0b94e6ea6b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-29T22:40:51.299Z\">10.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Body found in Bounty search</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One of the two missing crew members of the replica ship the <strong>Bounty</strong>, which ran into trouble off the coast of North Carolina early today, has been found.

There are already 1 million power outages, and this will climb in the coming hours.</p> <p>Second, rain amounts will continue to pile up. We're looking at rainfall totals that will likely exceed 10 inches in Delaware into Maryland. Rainfall amounts will likely not be great in New York City.</p> <p>Third, high tide is still on its way. Even if it is not as bad as expected in New York City, the worst is still to come. Do not be stupid and go outside.</p> <p>Fourth, snow will continue to fall in the Appalachians and will approach and perhaps exceed 3 feet in some areas when it's all said and done.</p> <p>Fifth, inland areas is beginning to start to get into the rain and tropical storm force winds.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-29T21:53:12.710Z\">at 9.53pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-508ef83095cb55519dae8b23\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-29T21:42:08.638Z\">9.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Our Washington</strong> bureau chief Ewen MacAskill reports on the increasingly blustery scene in the capital:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>DC up until the last hour has felt much like many other wet day.

The storm has transitioned from tropical to extra-tropical storm, he writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The difference between a tropical storm and an extratropical storm is not something that most people ever have to worry about. Tropical storms usually&#xa0;form in the tropics and have warm cores, while extratropical storms form further north and have cold cores. But in the case of Sandy, the difference&#xa0;is important.</p> <p>Extratropical storms move at a faster pace, so that's why the storm is speeding up right now.</p> <p>Extratropical storms are wider in nature. In Sandy's case, this means that the 940&#xa0;millibar low of Sandy isn't producing winds of 111+ mile per hour winds at its core. Instead those winds are spread out over a wider distance. That means less extreme damage in the immediate path of the storm, but effects over a larger area.</p> <p>By moving faster,<strong> Sandy's rainfall may be somewhat lesser in some areas.</strong> Sandy also looks to come aboard before high tide. The wind field may be more west oriented in nature instead of northeast. Thus, New York City, which is to the northeast of the storm, may benefit from two factors that may limit the worst coastal flooding.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-46809c63-7f81-4070-b820-c6c92a64228b\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/29/1351535413835/-460.gif\" alt=\"The projected path of Hurricane Sandy, as tracked by the NHC.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The projected path of Hurricane Sandy, as tracked by the NHC.

Here's Harry:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Proving that it still has surprises, Hurricane Sandy is unexpectedly speeding up to 25 to 30 miles per hour. What type of practical effects will this have?</p> <p>First, the storm could hit Southern New Jersey far earlier than planned. Instead of 8 pm to midnight, we could be looking at a landfall around 5 pm eastern. Expect conditions to rapidly deteriorate from here on out up and down the coast.</p> <p>Second, the storm has a possibility of slamming into southern New Jersey with low end category 2 hurricane winds of 96 miles per hour. Sandy already has max winds of 90 miles per hour and seems to be strengthening. This will lead to more wind damage and could help allow Sandy to hold onto tropical storm force winds even further inland than expected.</p> <p>Third, it's possible that rain amounts could lessen because the storm may exit more quickly. We should still see those 10 or 12 inch lollypop totals, but the wider 3-6 inch totals may be more limited. Either way, flooding will still be bad.</p> <p>We'll have to keep an eye on Sandy as it may have more tricks up its sleeve yet.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-508ebd2cb5792d0b94e6ea5e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-29T17:30:21.067Z\">5.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>While flooding on the coasts is getting a lot of attention right now, some of the worst devastation from Sandy could come from inland flooding caused by <strong>days of rain.</strong></p> <p>Here is the most recent <a href=\"http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/qpf/zoom/hltimages.shtml\">NOAA map</a> with rainfall predictions for the next five days.

Here's a summary of where things stand:</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Hurricane Sandy is within 200 miles of the New Jersey coast, with maximum sustained winds of 90mph</strong>. Landfall is expected this evening. A coastal flood warning and hurricane warning are in effect.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>President Barack Obama has warned of a \"big and powerful storm\".</strong> In a briefing at the White House, he warned residents up and down the US east coast to heed the warnings of officials and take Sandy seriously.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Significant flooding has already been reported.</strong> The public safety director for Atlantic City said much of the city is underwater. Ocean City, Maryland has been equally hard hit. In Delaware, 50,000 people are under an evacuation order.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Flooding is expected to peak in New York City between 6pm and 10.30pm,</strong> as the high tide coincides with landfall. Officials say the flooding is likely to far exceed that from Hurricane Irene last year.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Public transportation across the region is at a standstill. Schools are closed.</strong> Some businesses are open. West Virginia residents braced for what could be several feet of snow. Wide power outages from wind damage and fallen trees are expected.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Thousands have lost power in Virginia and Maryland</strong>. Power outages have also been reported in Connecticut and Rhode Island.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The US Coastguard had to rescue the crew of a tall ship, HMS Bounty, which got into distress 90 miles from the North Carolina shore.</strong> Fourteen crew members were flown to safety, but two remain unaccounted for, according to latest reports.</p> </div>   </div>",

This iceberg was a dynamic battleground, floodlit by 24-hour daylight. Once an iceberg is released from its parent glacier, its time is very limited. The ice is fighting a losing battle along its edges, as warm ocean water eats into it and then mini-bergs break off the weakened front. These break-up events were sudden, loud and violent. We had&#xa0;come to spectate on this oceanic siege, and to&#xa0;learn its rules. Our home was a small research ship, minuscule in comparison to the impregnable ice fortress.</p> <p>The ice edge towered over us, vertical, angular and utterly spectacular. We steamed around the berg until we found lower cliffs, and suddenly the&#xa0;icescape behind was revealed. It looked like a mini version of the South Downs, carved into ice. Gentle mounds were separated by valleys, and these led down to waterfalls of meltwater cascading into the ocean. The iceberg made its&#xa0;own fog, so we could only see a little way&#xa0;into the centre. We sailed round it, living&#xa0;life just on the wrong side of the edge,&#xa0;and peering hopefully over the top of&#xa0;the cliffs like a dog eyeing up a loaded dinner table.</p> <p>Curious polar bears peered back. We&#xa0;had&#xa0;thought we would be lucky to see one or two, but the iceberg turned out to have a healthy population of these huge carnivores. The summer is a lean time for them, as they wait for the sea ice to come back so that they can hunt. So they were snoozing away, not at all bothered that their&#xa0;chosen holiday home was moving, tilting, melting, breaking up and giving a&#xa0;TV&#xa0;production team and some scientists severe logistical headaches.</p> <p>That's how I remember the iceberg, and that's&#xa0;the side of it you'll see if you watch the programmes. But since then things have changed. We left a GPS tracker as a passenger, so we know that the iceberg has travelled 60&#xa0;miles, and is now about 30 miles south of where&#xa0;it&#xa0;was in August. It has done a few pirouettes, and only 65% of it is left. The battle has taken its&#xa0;toll. The iceberg only gets seven hours and 40&#xa0;minutes of daylight now, and soon the darkness will swallow it up completely. Since the&#xa0;supply of energy from the sun is so weak, the&#xa0;siege is over for this year. A winter respite is&#xa0;beginning.</p> <p>Sea ice is advancing towards the berg from the&#xa0;north. This is the other type of ice at the poles, formed when the sea surface itself freezes. It's fascinating stuff, because the salt is mostly squeezed out as it freezes, so sea ice is almost fresh. It starts as fragile platelets, and thickens as&#xa0;the water temperature drops. In an average year (out of the last 30 years), the sea ice would already have reached our iceberg. But this year, there was less summer sea ice in the Arctic than&#xa0;any other year on record, so it is taking longer for the great freeze to reach 69N. The sea ice is still crawling south, and when it touches the&#xa0;cliffs I saw, it will connect our iceberg to all the other ice in the Arctic. The iceberg will be frozen in place. Darkness and silence will rule. The bears will be able to walk out on to the sea ice&#xa0;and hunt again.</p> <p>In the middle of one of my typical frantic&#xa0;workdays, I enjoy imagining where&#xa0;\"our\" iceberg is now. I have a giant&#xa0;map of the world on my office wall, and it reminds me that the whole planet is&#xa0;accessible to a drop of water. After all, every ocean is connected to all other oceans. This iceberg is just ocean that has been in cold storage for a few thousand years. It is two years since it broke off from its parent glacier, and now we know it will last at least one more year as solid ice. But it will lose the battle in the end. Energy from the sun will free the water molecules and one day the last piece of solid ice will melt to a water drop.</p> <p>That drop could end up almost anywhere \u2013 as mist in a Costa Rican cloud forest, as a cup of tea&#xa0;in China, inside an Olympic athlete or in a puddle in Dorset. The coffee you're drinking as you read this could have been part of an iceberg once. And now it's going to become part of you. Isn't that fantastic?</p>",

Drawings and paintings are mixed with objects Van Gogh owned and painted which have never been on view, including a family Bible, and a wobbly drawing with the little model horse he was attempting to copy. The paintings are hung on walls painted intense colours \u2013 ochre, Chinese lacquer red, thunder cloud grey \u2013 so different from the original, sternly neutral backdrops but so successful in their effect that it may be imitated when the pictures return home.</p> <p>On the Hermitage side, until January, there is a spectacular exhibition of impressionist masterpieces, including a dazzling wall of Monets, the kind of pictures Van Gogh first saw when he went to Paris and which transformed his own art, the muddy colours of his early work giving way to brilliant blues, greens and yellows. One canvas is shown for the first time in a double-sided case, revealing how Van Gogh painted a typically early murky scene on one side, and only a few months later, unable to afford more canvas, painted a self portrait on the back in his sizzling new colours.</p> <p>Poor Van Gogh, who never had a permanent home in his adult life, hated moving house. He once wrote: \"Moving is causing me some considerable concern these days, because it's never straightforward. All the same, it will have to happen, if not now then later.\"</p> <p>That's precisely the conclusion the directors of the Van Gogh museum reached. It opened 40 years ago to house the biggest collection of works by the man who never sold a painting in his lifetime, but is now one of the best-loved and most expensive artists ever.</p> <p>The museum holds 200 paintings, 600 drawings, and <a href=\"http://www.vangoghletters.org/vg/\" title=\"\">800 of some of the best letters ever written</a>, mostly heavily illustrated, near-daily correspondence with his brother Theo \u2013 almost always ending with a plea for money \u2013 in which the gauche, socially awkward man poured out his thoughts, dreams, gossip, theories on art and life, and details of work in progress: he wrote of one wintry view of the garden of the asylum where he spent some of his last months that he had used \"green saddened with grey\".</p> <p>The museum was built for about 250,000 visitors a year, and last year had 1.6 million. Everything from the air conditioning to the shop was being overwhelmed by sheer numbers. The staff first thought they could gradually renew the building around the visitors, but last year decided they needed to empty it of paintings and people and get all the work done: \"Not a piece of news that as a museum director you ever want to learn,\" Axel Ruger said.</p> <p>It's a mark of the success of the museum that to the last day the crowds kept coming. As the paintings went into store and the galleries emptied they gradually cut the admission prices, but even on the last day, with only one floor open and little left on the walls \u2013 \"a very generous hang\", Ruger said wryly \u2013 there was a queue outside in the rain at opening time.</p> <p>The staff have set themselves an awesomely tight schedule. They have promised to be open again by 1 May 2013, in time for the 40th anniversary of the museum, the 160th of Van Gogh's birth, and a slew of local anniversaries including the 400th anniversary of Amsterdam's famous ring of canals, now crossed and recrossed by the red line of the Van Gogh mile.</p> <p>\"We hope visitors will find we are the same \u2013 but much better,\" Ruger said. \"2013 will be a sparkling season.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 30 October 2012. The original suggested that Van Gogh's Starry Night was on show in Amsterdam; in fact, it is in the permanent collection of MoMA, New York.</p>",

The streets are packed with traffic as people unwind from a hard week's work. The police are hard at work too.</p> <p>They pull over a huge SUV, driving at speed up a major road. As the car comes to a stop, the driver almost mounts the kerb. He staggers as he steps out of the car, his face ruddy from the beer he's been drinking. For Mexico City's <em>alcohol\u00edmetro</em> police, Friday nights keep their breathalysers busy.</p> <p>\"Sadly, people don't know how to be responsible drivers\", <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/video/2012/oct/05/drink-driving-mexico-road-safety-video\" title=\"\">says police officer Diana Gonzales</a> (video). \"They know they have consumed alcohol. But despite the fact we've been doing this for nine years here in Mexico City, people still aren't used to handing their car over to someone else who hasn't drunk alcohol.\"</p> <p>Although it rarely makes the headlines, more Mexicans have been killed on the roads than have died in the country's violent drug wars. Since 2006, an average of 16,700 people have been killed every year in road traffic accidents. The statistic places Mexico in the top 10 most dangerous countries in the world for road traffic deaths; it has the second highest death rates in Latin America, behind Argentina.</p> <p>So why, in a country with a relatively developed road network and a raft of road safety legislation measures in place, are so many people dying? Drink driving is a major factor, says Roy Rojas, the national co-ordinator for road safety for the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/roadsafety/decade_of_action/en/\" title=\"\">World Health Organisation</a> in Mexico. He says there is no social shame in getting caught over the limit while driving. According to the roadside police working their breathalysers, prosecutions for drink driving remain rare, so drivers continue to drink and drive with impunity.</p> <p>An even bigger risk on the roads is that only half the country's states have any kind of driving test system. Public transport workers aside, licences are therefore granted without any proof people can drive.</p> <p>Nor can Mexico fall back on the excuse that it lacks resources. \"Mexico City has the most pedestrian footbridges in the world,\" says Rojas. \"However, they are also the least used. Around half of all road deaths are pedestrians.\"</p> <p>Neither does Mexico lack road safety legislation. There are ample laws in place at federal, state and municipal levels that prohibit, for instance, the use of mobile phones while driving and failure to use seatbelts. People simply ignore the rules, which are rarely enforced by police and law enforcement agencies.</p> <p>All of this is compounded by the migration of people from rural areas who are unaccustomed to driving in densely populated cities where the movement of traffic is faster and more furious. According to Rojas, there is no link between literacy levels and driving skill; if anything, better-educated people tend to be more aggressive drivers, he says.</p> <p>But it's not all bad news. Mexico has experienced an improvement in road safety in the past two years, with the issue moving up the public policy agenda. \"There is now a trend towards vigilance. This is no longer a silent epidemic \u2013 now it's more out in the open,\" says Rojas.</p> <p>Despite its bad road safety record, deaths are stabilising year on year rather than rising, in part because federal and state authorities are increasingly working together to tackle the problem.</p> <p>Schemes such as Mexico City's <em>alcohol\u00edmetro</em> are also playing a part. The programme is viewed as pioneering by many other Mexican states. It is slowly seeding the idea that driving drunk is a crime and that there are repercussions for those who drink and then get behind the wheel. According to official figures from Mexico City's public security secretary, the presence of the <em>alcohol\u00edmetro</em> has reduced drink-driving accidents by 30% since it was launched in 2003.</p> <p>Gonzales, the police officer on the Friday night breathalyser beat, says drink driving has gone down since she started working the <em>alcohol\u00edmetro</em> three years ago. \"It's not the majority of people [who are over the limit] like before,\" she says.</p> <p>Still, Gonzales has her work cut out. In Mexico, cutting dangerous driving on the roads remains a battle that costs the country thousands of lives each year.</p>",
  "<p>It was not as visually striking as the replica Eiffel Tower a few miles down the road but the office off Eastern Avenue, in the gritty part of Las Vegas tourists seldom see, was just as incongruous.</p> <p>Smack in the middle of a row of Latino-owned stores, many with Spanish names and piped Mexican ballads, a sign on the facade announced its mission in big blue and red letters: Romney. Stencilled beneath it: believe in America.</p> <p>When it first opened it was challenge enough for locals to believe in this apparition. Republicans, here?</p> <p>This, after all, was eastern Las Vegas, a sprawl of nondescript strip malls, dilapidated taco restaurants and low-rise, bleached apartments which immigrants called home and Democrats called a bastion. Republican canvassers were as rare as unicorns.</p> <p>\"This is pretty groundbreaking. We've recruited hundreds of volunteers,\" beamed Elsa Barnhill, 25, the Republican's Nevada state director for Hispanic outreach, seated inside the office. \"We are narrowing the gap. We are starting to erode the bad image we had.\"</p> <p>Four years ago Barack Obama won Nevada by 12 points, the sort of margin where votes are weighed rather than counted, but victory this time is not assured.</p> <p>Polls in the state give the president <a href=\"http://townhall.com/polltracker/candidatepollsummary/nevada-obama-vs-romney\">a consistent but razor-thin lead </a>over his Republican challenger.</p> <p>The reason was visible from Barnhill's doorway: several nearby stores were boarded up and abandoned, testaments to disastrous levels of foreclosure and 12.1% unemployment, the nation's highest, with unemployment among the state's Latinos even worse, at 19%. Nevada has been dubbed ground zero of the economic crisis.</p> <p>A block away Manny and Lilia Ceballos, a Hispanic couple and registered Democrats who run a bail bond business, said they would not vote for Obama again. \"The economy has suffered. We need change,\" said Manny. \"To vote for him again and expect a different outcome would be the definition of madness. Republicans are friendlier to small business owners.\"</p> <p>Emboldened by such sentiments Republicans are raiding this core Democratic constituency, blitzing Spanish language media with adverts, identifying and registering supporters at community events, erecting signs and billboards saying \"Juntos con Romney\", together with Romney.</p> <p>\"Obama tells these good stories but this ain't time for that,\" said Robert Zavala, 43, a Nicaraguan-born activist who spends his days erecting Romney billboards. \"We're like Catholic missionaries. I was in a pro-Obama bakery the other day explaining things and at the end they gave me a cookie. People are waking up to reality.\"</p> <p>Romney has visited the state six times since becoming the de facto nominee and dispatched his Spanish-speaking son Craig as a touring surrogate.</p> <p>\"We've been making important headway in the Hispanic community, which has been disproportionately affected by the president's policies,\" said Mason Harrison, a Nevada campaign spokesman who also worked here for John McCain's presidential bid.</p> <p>\"People are excited. We've made three times as many phone calls and knocked on five times as many doors as we did in 2008. For the first time we've opened an office in east Las Vegas, right in the belly of the beast. As a result, we're much closer to where we want to be. I think we're going to surprise a lot of people with our turnout.\"</p> <h2>'They're really going for it'</h2> <p>If Harrison is right, Nevada, with just six electoral college votes, could prove decisive. Having backed the winner in nine of the last 10 presidential elections it also boasts bellwether mystique: as Nevada goes, so goes the nation.</p> <p>Both sides agree Latinos, comprising 14% of the electorate, are crucial. In 2008 about 70% backed Obama, according to exit polls. Republicans know most will again back the president; the challenge is to whittle the margin so Republican bastions in rural areas, and their apparent edge in Washoe county, which includes Reno, will outweigh Obama's huge lead in Clark county, which includes Las Vegas and accounts for three-quarters of Latinos. Romney, analysts say, needs to bag at least a third of Latino votes to prevail.</p> <p>Hence the Republican outpost on Eastern Avenue and the unfamiliar spectacle of Republican party activists and newly formed conservative groups like <a href=\"http://nevadahispanics.org/home/\">Nevada Hispanics</a> canvassing in poor neighbourhoods.</p> <p>\"We've seen them out there. They're really going for it,\" said Leo Murietta, Nevada state director of <a href=\"http://mifamiliavota.us/\">Mi Familia Vota</a>, a non-partisan group which itself registered 17,301 Latino voters in Nevada.</p> <p>Will the Republican outreach prise this state, and possibly the presidency, from Obama?</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ralstonreports.com/\">Jon Ralston</a>, a prominent commentator and analyst, gave a blunt assessment. \"Mitt Romney is getting crushed here among Latinos, as he is elsewhere. You can't lose this demographic group by this size and hope to win the race.\"</p> <p>A poll last week <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/burns-haberman/2012/10/ppp-nevada-poll-obama-romney-147137.html\">gave Obama 69% support</a> among Nevada's Latinos and Romney 28%. </p> <p>Meaning there are precious few couples like the Ceballos, the repentant Democrats.</p> <p>The bright lining for Romney is Latinos lag other groups in expressed commitment to go to the polls. But in Nevada Democrats have racked up an impressive advantage in voter registration \u2013 120,000 in Clark county alone. \"If those voters turn out I don't see how Mitt Romney makes the maths work,\" said Ralston.</p> <p>With the state's economy so bad Obama should be reeling, he added, but Romney's stance on immigration during the primary campaign, when he tacked right to outflank rivals and opposed the Dream act, sabotaged his Latino outreach. \"He took a position that has come back to haunt him. You can't undo that in one election cycle.\"</p> <p>Latinos routinely rank jobs and healthcare above immigration in a list of concerns, stoking Republican hopes of making the election a referendum on the economy, but immigration was a \"trigger issue\", said Murietta, of Mi Familia Vota.</p> <p>Jody Agius Vallejo, a sociology professor and author of Barrio to Burbs: the making of the Mexican-American middle class, said latinos were diverse and potentially open to Republican arguments but they felt \"villainised\" by the party. \"Many Latinos, regardless of their national origin or immigrant generation acutely feel the waves of hostility.\"</p> <p>Romney's Eastern Avenue office was a lonely outpost. Next door Damaris Rosales, 25, had mounted an Obama poster at the entrance to her family's photo print store. Brought to the US from Mexico as an infant, her battle to be allowed to study and legally work had affected her extended family. \"They saw my struggle, saw what I had to go through,\" she said. Obama's support for Dream and his deferral of deportations for young Latinos salved disappointment with his administration's record level of deportations and stalled immigration reform, said Rosales.</p> <p>Diners tucking into $1.49 tacos at a nearby restaurant, Carniceria La Bonita, agreed. \"We all have siblings, cousins, friends, someone, who is undocumented,\" said Olga, 48, a Guatemalan-born cleaner who declined to give her surname.</p> <p>\"Walk down the street in Arizona and they can arrest you just for being Hispanic,\" said her partner, Edgar, 50, a landscape gardener. Neither had papers to vote but they said their children and siblings would vote for Obama. A Salvadorean at a neighbouring table said he \"would die for Obama\".</p> <p>The diners mocked Romney's Spanish language ads and his apparent spray tan for a Univision interview. \"Yeah, and now I'm a turkey voting for Christmas,\" said Edgar.</p>",
  "<p>Getting to know the intricacies of a new university has its challenges \u2013 doing it for two at the same time, when they are almost exactly antipodian to each other, seems foolhardy. Yet in July I was offered my dream position, that of joint academic vice-president of two great universities, <a href=\"http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">the University of Warwick</a> in the UK and <a href=\"http://www.monash.edu.au/\" title=\"\">Monash University</a> in Australia. The role is to lead their cross-border, indeed world-spanning, <a href=\"http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/about/partnerships/monash/\" title=\"\">Monash-Warwick Alliance</a>. It is both an exciting challenge and an enormous opportunity.</p> <p>To paraphrase a memorable and possibly apocryphal George W-ism, \"The world is getting more global\", and that is as true for higher education and research as it is for any industry. And yet there has been little or no globalisation in how we organize ourselves; no global entity runs viable universities in multiple countries and no truly transnational offering for students and academics exists. Yes, there are outposts of universities in China, South East Asia and the Middle East. Does this in itself create a truly global university?</p> <p>As we see it, Warwick and Monash are doing much more. We seek to be a globally integrated university alliance; not a loose affiliation of some dozen or more universities, but a tight, yet broad, partnership between two proud universities who will co-develop courses, co-invest in technologies and attract the best researchers who want access to the best facilities \u2013 and the best students too.</p> <p>Both universities are embedded within their home countries but together they now offer a connected experience to students wherever they come from in the world. Those students will be able to do a course made up of components from either institution, experiencing learning from Europe and/or the Asia-Pacific, and become globally aware and culturally adept graduates. We hope also to appeal to researchers of laboratories running simultaneously on either side of the world, to PhD students from both continents, and to support and research funding sources in more than one system.</p> <p>Why and how? The why is simple. Our websites state it clearly: \"A key aim of the alliance is to help meet the increasing student, industry and government demand for universities to produce graduates with a global education, and to undertake research that addresses world-relevant and strategically important problems.\"</p> <p>We know (and governments understand) that global challenges will not be solved by parochial thinking or small groups using the approaches they have always used. It will require bigger collaborations, transnational partnerships and a degree of inter-disciplinarity that has proved so difficult to foster within single institutions. To have even a chance to do that we need the best globally aware academics and students, those who feel Beijing, New York or Singapore are as likely to offer an answer \u2013 or the right person to work with \u2013 as the UK or Australia. These people know that time-zone and distance barriers merely mean Skype rather than coffee together.</p> <p>Why Warwick and Monash? Both are aggressively ambitious children of the 1960s, the baby boomers of higher education. Both have risen quickly in their home markets and seek a way to keep that rate of growth going and challenge historical elites. That will not happen by incremental growth; it requires disruptive innovative thinking. Industry and philanthropists, government and the populace all expect us to work together. We aim to make the system encourage and support this, rather than block it.</p> <p>We enjoy breaking down barriers. Why not find a way for the two HR systems to work together to find the best employment solution for the 30 planned senior professorial posts? They have already done it for my own post \u2013 and there are more to come. How will the universities provide for governance and academic leadership below the level of the two vice-chancellors and presidents? That is my role, and I wouldn't have taken it on if I hadn't seen the commitment of dedicated staff in both universities already taking to Skype, Facetime, instant messaging, Jabber and DropBox as if they were teenagers.</p> <p>Lastly I am asked: how will the alliance get students involved? And how will joint teaching work? These may be the ultimate examples of challenges that turn out to be opportunities. Both student bodies are hungry to create ways to serve their members better and more creatively, and students themselves are already finding solutions such as launching <a href=\"http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/warwick-monash_global_undergraduate\" title=\"\">the joint undergraduate research journal, Reinvention</a>.</p> <p>Markers of success are already coming in. Funders are backing the idea with hard cash: \u00a3500,000 from the UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) under its <a href=\"http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/funding/calls/2012/Pages/globalengagementsinresearch.aspx\" title=\"\">Building Global Engagements programme</a> to build connections in the physical sciences; \u00a366,000 from the Australian government to support student mobility; and \u00a3200,000 from the Australian Research Council grant to build collaborations in engineering. And that's before any of our joint appointments have even started their jobs. There will be an awful lot more \u2013 people, money, news \u2013 in the coming months.</p> <p><em>Andrew J Stewart Coats is joint academic vice-president of </em><a href=\"http://www.monash.edu.au/\" title=\"\"><em>Monash University</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>the University of Warwick</em></a><em>, and director of the </em><a href=\"http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/about/partnerships/monash/\" title=\"\"><em>Monash Warwick Alliance</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>In 1967 it was the then archbishop of Canterbury, Michael Ramsey, who spoke in the House of Lords to support the decriminalisation of homosexuality in this country, thus making a clear distinction in British law between a moral and a criminal issue.</p> <p>No such distinction exists in many parts of the world and, as a result, people are suffering horrendous abuse and even death for being who they are and loving who they love. Many of us have met people who have shared the most disturbing personal stories, including a very small number who have been granted asylum on grounds of sexual orientation in this country.</p> <p>Others in this debate have rehearsed the ways in which laws criminalising same-sex sexual activity between adults have been repeatedly found in international law to violate fundamental human rights, and this debate serves also to highlight effectively the way in which criminalisation gives rise to persecution. I want, however, to concentrate on the way in which discriminatory interference in the private sexual conduct of consenting adults is an affront to the fundamental Christian values of human dignity, tolerance and equality.</p> <p>It is of course no secret, as others have made clear, that on the ethics of homosexual practice the churches in general and the Anglican communion bishops in particular are deeply divided, but that cannot and must not be any basis for equivocating on the central issue of equality before the law of all human beings whether heterosexual or homosexual. Further, many of us who are bishops in this country value and treasure our links with particular dioceses around the Anglican communion. We respect and appreciate the different, and often sharply divided, theological approaches which lead to different stances on the ethical issues. But, as the Lambeth conference of 1998 made clear, there is not and cannot be any place for homophobia in the church, and all are to be welcomed regardless of sexual orientation.</p> <p>Few have spoken on this issue as unequivocally as archbishop Desmond Tutu, who said in 2010 at a United Nations high-level panel:</p> <blockquote> \"All over the world, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people are persecuted. They face violence, torture and criminal sanctions because of how they live and who they love. We make them doubt that they too are children of God \u2013 and this must be nearly the ultimate blasphemy.\" <br> </blockquote> <p>Indeed, in recent years, successive statements from the leaders of major Christian denominations in the west have made similar points, including perhaps most consistently, those from the Society of Friends, which has stated:</p> <blockquote> \"We affirm the love of God for all people, whatever their sexual orientation, and our conviction that sexuality is an important part of human beings as created by God, so that to reject people on the grounds of their sexual behaviour is a denial of God's creation.\" <br> </blockquote> <p>Many people the world over are now asking the churches to put their position beyond all doubt, by saying simply and clearly that criminalisation is wrong. I will put my position beyond all doubt by stating it in as clear terms as I can. If criminalisation leads, as it evidently does, to gay people concealing their own identity, that must be wrong; if criminalisation leads to many living in fear, that must be wrong; if criminalisation leads to the prospect of persecution, arrest, detention and death, that must be wrong; and if criminalisation means that LGBT people dare not turn to the state when facing hate crimes and violence, that must be wrong too.</p> <p>It is within the adult lifetime of most of us in this House that the law was changed in this country to decriminalise homosexual acts. However, for our children's generation, such a state of affairs must feel like ancient history \u2013 as appropriate to the moral climate of today's society in this country as the burning of witches. We must all urgently pursue this journey to a completely new climate in those many countries of the world where same-sex relations are criminal offences.</p> <p>\u2022 This is an edited version of a speech delivered in the House of Lords debate on <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/121025-0002.htm#12102541000762\" title=\"\">homosexuality in the developing world</a></p>",
  "<p>In ancient China, the arrival of a new dynasty was accompanied by \"the rectification of names\", a ceremony in which the sloppiness and erosion of meaning that had taken place under the previous dynasty were cleared up and language and its subjects correlated again. It was like a debt jubilee, only for meaning rather than money.</p> <p>This was part of what made <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/11/17/081117fa_fact_lizza\" title=\"\">Barack Obama's first presidential campaign</a> so electrifying: he seemed like a man who spoke our language and called many if not all things by their true names. Whatever caused that season of clarity, once elected, Obama promptly sank into the stale, muffled, parallel-universe language wielded by most politicians, and has remained there ever since. Meanwhile, the far right has got as far as it has by mislabelling just about everything in our world \u2013 a phenomenon which went supernova in this year of \"legitimate rape\", \"the apology tour\" and \"job creators\". Meanwhile, their fantasy version of economics keeps getting more fantastic. (Maybe there should be a rectification of numbers, too.)</p> <p>Let's rectify some names ourselves. We often speak as though the source of so many of our problems is complex and even mysterious. I'm not sure it is. You can blame it all on greed: the refusal to do anything about climate change, the attempts by the .01% to destroy our democracy, the constant robbing of the poor, the resultant starving children, the war against most of what is beautiful on this Earth.</p> <p>Calling lies \"lies\" and theft \"theft\" and violence \"violence\", loudly, clearly and consistently, until truth becomes more than a bump in the road, is a powerful aspect of political activism. Much of the work around human rights begins with accurately and aggressively reframing the status quo as an outrage, whether it's misogyny or racism or poisoning the environment. What protects an outrage are disguises, circumlocutions, and euphemisms \u2013 \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" for torture, \"collateral damage\" for killing civilians, \"the war on terror\" for the war against you and me and our Bill of Rights.</p> <p>Change the language and you've begun to change the reality or at least to open the status quo to question. Here is Confucius on the rectification of names:</p> <blockquote> \"If language is not correct, then what is said is not what is meant; if what is said is not what is meant, then what must be done remains undone; if this remains undone, morals and art will deteriorate; if justice goes astray, the people will stand about in helpless confusion. Hence there must be no arbitrariness in what is said. This matters above everything.\" </blockquote> <p>So let's start calling manifestations of greed by their true name. By greed, I mean the attempt of those who have plenty to get more, not the attempts of the rest of us to survive or lead a decent life. Look at the Waltons of Wal-Mart fame: the four main heirs are among the dozen richest people on the planet, each holding about $24bn (\u00a315bn). Their wealth is equivalent to that of the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/31/bernie-s/sanders-says-walmart-heirs-own-more-wealth-bottom-/\" title=\"\">bottom 40%</a> of Americans. The corporation Sam Walton founded now employs 2.2 million workers, two-thirds of them in the US, and the great majority are poorly paid people who feel intimidated and are often underemployed, and routinely depend on government benefits to survive. You could call that Walton Family welfare \u2013 a taxpayers' subsidy to their system. Strikes <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2012/10/10/walmart_workers_in_12_states_stage\" title=\"\">launched against Wal-Mart</a> this summer and autumn protested working conditions of astonishing barbarity \u2013 alleged abuses include warehouses that reach 48C (120F), a woman eight months pregnant <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/13/walmart-warehouse-workers-pilgrimage-photos_n_1881306.html?1347649325\" title=\"\">forced to work</a> at a brutal pace, commonplace exposure to pollutants, and the intimidation of those who attempted to organise or unionise.</p> <p>You would think that $24,000,000,000 apiece would be enough, but the Walton family sits atop a machine which appears intent upon brutalising tens of millions of people \u2013 the suppliers of Wal-Mart notorious for their abysmal working conditions, as well as the employees of the stores \u2013 only to add to piles of wealth already obscenely vast. Of course, what we call corporations are, in fact, perpetual motion machines, set up to endlessly extract wealth (and leave slagheaps of poverty behind) no matter what.</p> <p>They are generally organised in such a way that the brutality that leads to wealth extraction is committed by subcontractors at a distance or described in euphemisms, so that the stockholders, board members, and senior executives never really have to know what's being done in their names. And yet it is their job to know \u2013 just as it is each of our jobs to know what systems feed us and exploit or defend us, and the job of writers, historians, and journalists to rectify the names for all these things.</p> <p>The most terrifying passage in whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg's gripping book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/0142003425/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20\" title=\"\">Secrets: A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers</a> is not about his time in Vietnam, or his life as a fugitive after he released the Pentagon Papers. It's about a 1969 dinnertime conversation with a co-worker in a swanky house in Pacific Palisades, California. It took place right after Ellsberg and five of his colleagues had written a letter to the New York Times arguing for immediate withdrawal from the unwinnable, brutal war in Vietnam, and Ellsberg's host said, \"If I were willing to give up all this ... if I were willing to renege on ... my commitment to send my son to Groton ... I would have signed the letter.\"</p> <p>In other words, his unnamed co-worker had weighed trying to prevent the violent deaths of hundreds of thousands of people against the upper-middle-class perk of having his kid in a fancy prep school, and chosen the latter. The man who opted for Groton was, at least, someone who worked for what he had and who could imagine having painfully less. This is not true of the ultra-rich shaping the future of our planet.</p> <p>They could send tens of thousands to Groton, buy more Renoirs and ranches, and still not exploit the poor or destroy the environment, but they're as insatiable as they are ruthless. They are often celebrated in their aesthetic side-effects: imposing mansions, <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/08/30/100830fa_fact_mayer\" title=\"\">cultural patronage</a>, jewels, yachts. But in many, maybe most, cases they got rich through something a lot uglier, and that ugliness is still ongoing. Rectifying the names would mean revealing the ugliness of the sources of their fortunes and the grotesque scale on which they contrive to amass them, rather than the gaudiness of the trinkets they buy with them. It would mean seeing and naming the destruction that is the corollary of most of this wealth creation.</p> <p>Where this matters most is climate change. Why have we done almost nothing over the past 25 years about what was then a terrifying threat and is now a present catastrophe? Because it was bad for quarterly returns and fossil-fuel portfolios. When posterity indicts our era, this will be the feeble answer for why we did so little \u2013 that the rich and powerful with ties to the carbon-emitting industries have done everything in their power to prevent action on, or even recognition of, the problem. In this country in particular, they spent a fortune sowing doubt about the science of climate change and punishing politicians who brought the subject up. In this way have we gone through four \"debates\" and nearly a full election cycle with climate change unmentioned and unmentionable.</p> <p>These three decades of refusing to respond have wasted crucial time. It's as though you were prevented from putting out a fire until it was raging: now the tundra is thawing and Greenland's ice shield <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/greenland-melt.html\" title=\"\">is melting</a> and nearly every natural system is disrupted, from the acidifying oceans to the erratic seasons to droughts, floods, heat waves, and wildfires, and the failure of crops. We can still respond, but the climate is changed; the damage we all spoke of, only a few years ago, as being in the future is here, now.</p> <p>You can look at the chief executive officers of the oil corporations \u2013 Chevron's John Watson, for example, <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2012/04/13/chevron-boss-john-watson-made-25m-2011.html\" title=\"\">who received almost $25 million</a> ($1.57 million in salary and the rest in \"compensation\") in 2011 \u2013 or their major shareholders. They can want for nothing. They're so rich they could quit the game at any moment. When it comes to climate change, some of the wealthiest people in the world have weighed the fate of the Earth and every living thing on it for untold generations to come, the seasons and the harvests, this whole exquisite planet we evolved on, and they have come down on the side of more profit for themselves, the least needy people the world has ever seen.</p> <p>Take those billionaire energy tycoons Charles and David Koch, who are all over American politics these days. They are spending <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/03/koch-brothers-100-million-obama_n_1250828.html\" title=\"\">tens of millions of dollars</a> to defeat Obama, partly because he offends their conservative sensibilities, but also because he is less likely to be a completely devoted servant of their profit margins. He might, if we shout loud enough, rectify a few names. Under pressure, he might even listen to the public or environmental groups, while Romney poses no such problem (and under a Romney administration they will probably make more back in tax cuts than they are gambling on his election).</p> <p>Two years ago, the Koch brothers <a href=\"http://grist.org/article/koch-brothers-jump-into-prop-23-fight/\" title=\"\">spent $1m</a> on California's Proposition 23, an initiative written and put on the ballot by out-of-state oil companies to overturn our 2006 Global Warming Solutions Act. It lost by a landslide, but the Koch brothers have also invested a small fortune in spreading climate-change denial and sponsoring the Tea Party (which they can count on to oppose climate change regulation as big government or interference with free enterprise). This year they're backing a California initiative to silence unions. They want nothing to stand in the way of corporate power and the exploitation of fossil fuels. Think of it as another kind of war, and consider the early casualties.</p> <p>As the Irish Times <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2012/0620/1224318256659.html\" title=\"\">put it in an editorial</a> this summer:</p> <blockquote> \"Across Africa, Asia, and Latin America, hundreds of millions are struggling to adapt to their changing climate. In the last three years, we have seen 10 million people displaced by floods in Pakistan, 13 million face hunger in east Africa, and over 10 million in the Sahel region of Africa face starvation. Even those figures only scrape the surface. According to the Global Humanitarian Forum, headed up by former UN secretary general Kofi Annan, climate change is responsible for 300,000 deaths a year and affects 300 million people annually. By 2030, the annual death toll related to climate change is expected to rise to 500,000 and the economic cost to rocket to $600 billion.\" </blockquote> <p>This coming year may see a dramatic increase in hunger due to rising food prices from crop failures, including this summer's in the US midwest after a scorching drought in which the Mississippi river <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/07/16/520241/low-water-levels-on-the-mississippi-river-a-major-threat-to-commerce-this-is-absolutely-not-normal/\" title=\"\">nearly ran dry</a> and crops withered.</p> <p>We need to talk about climate change as a war against nature, against the poor (especially the poor of Africa), and against the rest of us. There are casualties, there are deaths, and there is destruction, and it's all mounting. Rectify the name, call it war. While we're at it, take back the term \"pro-life\" to talk about those who are trying to save the lives of all the creatures suffering from the collapse of the complex systems on which plant and animal as well as human lives depend. The other side: \"pro-death\".</p> <p>The complex array of effects from climate change and their global distribution, as well as their scale and the science behind them makes it harder to talk about than almost anything else on Earth, but we should talk about it all the more because of that. And yes, the rest of us should do more, but what is the great obstacle those who have already tried to do so much invariably come up against? The oil corporations, the coal companies, the energy industry, its staggering <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/10/24/1064231/three-ways-big-oil-spends-its-profits-to-defend-oil-subsidies-and-defeat-clean-energy/\" title=\"\">financial clout</a>, its swarms of <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/08/01/579101/jurassic-park-romneys-bush-era-energy-team-is-dominated-by-fossil-fuel-insiders-and-its-lobbyists/\" title=\"\">lobbyists</a>, and the politicians in its clutches. Those who benefit most from the status quo, I learned in studying disasters, are always the least willing to change.</p> <p>I'm a Californian so I faced the current version of American greed early. Proposition 13, the initiative that froze property taxes and made it nearly impossible to raise taxes in our state, went into effect in 1978, two years before California's former governor Ronald Reagan won the presidency, in part by catering to greed. Prop 13, as it came to be known, went into effect when California was still an affluent state with the best educational system in the world, including some of the top universities around, nearly free to in-staters all the way through graduate school. Tax cuts have trashed the state and <a href=\"http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175600/andy_kroll_back_to_$chool\" title=\"\">that education system</a>, and they are now doing the same to our country. The public sphere is to society what the biosphere is to life on earth: the space we live in together, and the attacks on them have parallels.</p> <p>What are taxes? They are that portion of your income that you contribute to the common good. Most of us are unhappy with how they're allocated \u2013 though few outside the left talk about the fact that more than half of federal <a href=\"http://nationalpriorities.org/en/budget-basics/federal-budget-101/spending/\" title=\"\">discretionary expenditures</a> go to our <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/defense-spending-broken-down-with-infographic-2012-6\" title=\"\">gargantuan military</a>, more money than is spent on the <a href=\"http://www.sipri.org/research/armaments/milex/resultoutput/milex_15/the-15-countries-with-the-highest-military-expenditure-in-2011-table/view\" title=\"\">next 14 militaries combined</a>. Ever since Reagan, the right has complained unceasingly about fantasy expenditures \u2013 from that president's <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/01/23/politics/weflare-queen/index.html\" title=\"\">\"welfare queens\"</a> to Mitt Romney's attack on Big Bird and PBS (which consumes <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2012/10/04/romney-promises-to-cut-taxpayer-funding-for-pbs-but-says-he-still-loves-big-bird/\" title=\"\">.001%</a> of federal expenditures).</p> <p>As part of its religion of greed, the right invented a series of myths about where those taxes went, how paying them was the ultimate form of oppression, and what boons tax cuts were to bring us. They then delivered the biggest tax cuts of all to those who already had a superfluity of money and weren't going to pump the extra they got back into the economy. What they really were saying was that they wanted to hang onto every nickel, no matter how the public sphere was devastated, and that they really served the ultra-rich, over and over again, not the suckers who voted them into office.</p> <p>Despite decades of cutting to the bone, they continue to promote tax cuts as if they had yet to happen. Their constant refrain is that we are too poor to feed the poor or educate the young or heal the sick, but the poverty isn't monetary: it's moral and emotional. Let's rectify some more language: even at this moment, the United States remains the richest nation the world has ever seen, and California \u2013 with the richest agricultural regions on the planet and a colossal high-tech boom still ongoing in Silicon Valley \u2013 is loaded, too. Whatever its problems, the US is still swimming in abundance, even if that abundance is divided up ever more unequally.</p> <p>Really, there's more than enough to feed every child well, to treat every sick person, to educate everyone well without saddling them with hideous debt, to support the arts, to protect the environment \u2013 to produce, in short, a glorious society. The obstacle is greed. We could still make the sorts of changes climate change requires of us and become a very different nation without overwhelming pain. We would then lead somewhat different lives \u2013 richer, not poorer, for most of us (in meaning, community, power, and hope). Because this culture of greed impoverishes all of us, it is, to call it by its true name, destruction.</p> <p>One of the great accomplishments of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/occupy-wall-street\" title=\"\">Occupy Wall Street</a> was this rectification of names. Those who came together under that rubric named the greed, inequality, and injustice in our system; they made the brutality of debt and the subjugation of the debtors visible; they called out Wall Street's crimes; they labelled the wealthiest among us the \"1%\", those who have made a profession out of pumping great sums of our wealth upwards (quite a different kind of tax). It was a label that made instant sense across much of the political spectrum. It was a good beginning. But there's so much more to do.</p> <p>Naming is only part of the work, but it's a crucial first step. A doctor initially diagnoses, then treats; an activist or citizen must begin by describing what is wrong before acting. To do that well is to call things by their true names. Merely calling out these names is a beam of light powerful enough to send the destroyers it shines upon scurrying for cover like roaches. After that, you still need to name your vision, your plan, your hope, your dream of something better.</p> <p>Names matter; language matters; truth matters. In this era when the mainstream media serve obfuscation and evasion more than anything else (except distraction), alternative media, social media, demonstrations in the streets, and conversations between friends are the refuges of truth, the places where we can begin to rectify the names. So start talking.</p>",
  "<p>On Friday night it started snowing. Very slowly at first, just a few flakes descending in the bitter Nottingham air. But then the sky began to fill with these little dots of ice and the revellers wandering along Beastmarket Hill pulled their hands into their shirt sleeves as they searched for taxis. Amid the modest flurry, I passed the main tent of the GameCity festival, occupying its usual place in the city's old square. Even at this hour, light was emanating from within, the promise of one more day of fun before the show ended on Saturday evening. But I was overcome with disappointment because I knew I wouldn't be going in again until next year. I buttoned up my coat and trudged off, dejected. </p> <p><a href=\"http://festival.gamecity.org/\">GameCity</a> is brilliant. Directed by Iain Simons and organised by a small but committed team (with the help of Nottingham Trent University and the city council), it seeks to provide an inclusive and exciting series of talks and events at venues all over the city. Throughout it all, indie developers, students and academics are able to exhibit their latest titles in the central tent, which is open and welcoming to all, from toddlers to pensioners. </p> <p>At this year's festival, you could see Phil Fish, the creator of Fez, giving a talk in which he imagined it was 2027. He provided a complex timeline leading to the release of Fez Forever, his first game's much delayed sequel \u2013 the timeline included a world war, a global electromagnetic blackout and the merger of Apple and Google into Agooglple. The talk was funny, self-depricating and at times biting (apparently the Xbox 360 version of Fez won't be patched successfully until 2024), and it was unlike any talk I'd seen in games before. </p> <p>Elsewhere, Ed Key gave a playthrough of his atmospheric retro-tinged exploration game <a href=\"http://www.visitproteus.com/\">Proteus</a>, accompanied by a live score \u2013 the audience was enraptured. We saw Irish coder <a href=\"http://distractionware.com/blog/\">Terry Cavanagh</a> challenging Edge journalist Jason Killingsworth to a blistering game of hardcore puzzler Super Hexagon. We saw the hugely likeable developer Mike Bithell asking a succession of industry legends how he could improve his own game, <a href=\"http://www.thomaswasalone.com/\">Thomas Was Alone</a>. Martin Hollis, co-creator of GoldenEye, told him it was fine as it is. Bithell looked as though he wanted time to stop and replay that moment forever.</p> <p>And on it went. We met <a href=\"http://minecraftedu.com/\">Minecraft Edu</a>, the small team of educators helping to promote the massively successful building game as a valuable classroom resource. We met the team from Media Molecule, the creators of LittleBigPlanet, who turned up to make paper models of their forthcoming title Tearaway. We got the radio show <a href=\"http://www.onelifeleft.com/\">One Life Left</a> doing their video game karaoke, encouraging audience members to sing new versions of pop hits modified to have gaming themes. Steve Owen of GamesPress managed to transform Ironic by Alannis Morrisette into a stinging indictment of unimaginative games writing (sample lyric: \"'It's like Heavy Rain on LCD, buy this game if it's your cup of tea'\").</p> <p>By way of contrast to that performance, Friday night saw an event named Reads Like a Seven, in which a bunch of journalists read out a series of their own articles \u2013 a sort of poetry slam, but with games. I had my reservations about the format, but it was an amazing night, with wonderful performances from Leigh Alexander, Ste Curran, Kieron Gillen, Simon Parkin and Cara Ellison. Oh, I also read out <a href=\"http://www.hookshotinc.com/confessions-of-a-middle-aged-games-writer/\">something</a> - it was\u2026 difficult.</p> <p>'Inspirational' is one word that kept cropping up during chats with other attendees. There is nothing about GameCity that smacks of the usual nonsense; no booth babes or bombastic trailers belting out on mega-watt sound systems, no superstar developers hyping franchise reboots or next generation graphics engines. Just lots of people who love games, or love discovering them, enjoying a sense of community, the brotherhood of a shared and meaningful passion. </p> <p>In the main tent, the heart of GameCity, the magic of gaming was apparent at every turn. The parents trying out touch-based shooters with their teenagers; the octogenarian couple helping each other to use an Xbox 360 controller; the kids interacting with Proteus by bouncing on a trampoline. I saw Lewie Proctor of <a href=\"http://savygamer.co.uk/\">Savygamer</a> playing the astonishing physical climbing game <a href=\"http://www.foddy.net/2011/03/girp/\">Girp</a>, with his dad; I'm glad I stumbled upon this heartwarming scene before the reading event on Friday night or I probably would have burst out crying.</p> <p>What GameCity7 said to me is that games are about so much more than this ridiculous month in which all the Triple AAA heavy-hitters flood onto the shop shelves at once. They spread out wider and further, they embrace companionship and community, laughter and sharing and creativity. They are life \u2013 just as much as music, books and movies are. These are the thoughts that kept me warm last Friday night as the snow fell on Nottingham town centre and the GameCity tent receded into the distance, into the past.</p>",

  "<p>It was a film that inspired Professor Matt Waite to set up the <a href=\"http://www.dronejournalismlab.org/\" title=\"\">Drone Journalism Lab</a>. It begins with a man walking across a field, carrying a large metal briefcase. He stops, opens it, revealing what looks like a model aircraft. Using a tablet computer, he selects part of the surrounding area on a digital map, then transfers the flight plan to the model aircraft and launches it into the sky. It flies on autopilot, taking thousands of pictures before landing in a pre-programmed zone. The man removes a memory stick from the device and uploads the data for processing. A few hours later, he's viewing a high-definition terrain map compiled from the photos.</p> <p>This isn't a science fiction movie. It's the product demo for the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxnWmc0ZTvA\" title=\"\">Gatewing X100</a>, one of a number of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that anyone can buy today. These machines, commonly known as drones, are already used by the military, the police and the agricultural industry for a variety of purposes \u2013 some bloody, some benign and some seemingly designed to provoke people into quoting from George Orwell's 1984.</p> <p>But when Waite, an award-winning investigative reporter, stumbled across the X100 during a visit to a major geographical technology event, he was immediately struck by how it could be used for journalism.</p> <p>\"My reporter brain went 'well there's every tornado, every hurricane, I've ever covered'. This device would be able to do hyper-accurate damage-assessment maps in a matter of hours. With traditional reporting techniques, it takes days, if not weeks. We could rapidly change the way we cover disasters by using UAVs.\"</p> <p>He took out his credit card, hoping to buy an X100 and begin experimenting. But there were two problems: firstly, they cost around \u00a340,000; secondly, it's illegal to fly one in United States airspace. So Waite went home empty handed.</p> <p>Still, he couldn't shake the idea of using drones for journalism. So with the help of a $50,000 (\u00a330,000) grant and the support of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, he founded the Drone Journalism Lab to explore the technical, ethical and legal issues.</p> <h2>Getting off the ground</h2> <p>With the X100 way beyond his budget, Waite turned to a \u00a3200 off-the-shelf drone, the <a href=\"http://ardrone.parrot.com/parrot-ar-drone/select-site\" title=\"\">Parrot AR</a>. This small, lightweight device can be controlled using a smartphone or tablet. It's also able to stream real-time HD video footage to a computer.</p> <p>Of course, bigger drones that can carry bulky news cameras and fly for long periods cost thousands of pounds more. But that's still cheap compared with the cost of hiring a helicopter or plane to capture aerial footage.</p> <p>\"If you don't have the kind of huge budget you need to keep a helicopter around all the time, then suddenly this becomes an interesting opportunity,\" says Professor Robert G Picard, of the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, University of Oxford. The institute is staging a <a href=\"http://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/about/news/item/article/workshop-will-explore-issues-in-the.html\" title=\"\">drone journalism workshop</a> on 22 October.</p> <p>However, the day when Sky News trades in its \"SkyCopter\" for a drone is still some way off. For starters, Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) <a href=\"http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/33/CAP722.pdf\" title=\"\">regulations</a> make it difficult to fly a drone in built-up areas \u2013 the very places where a news drone would be most effective. They can't be flown further than 500 meters from the operator, or higher than 400 feet, which limits their usefulness for news gathering.</p> <p>The situation could change in a few years time: a European Commission <a href=\"http://dronewarsuk.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/ec-swd_civilrpas.pdf\" title=\"\">working paper</a> released in September outlines plans to open up European civil airspace to unmanned drones by 2016 (a similar law will come into effect in 2015 in the US), which would allow them to operate alongside manned aircraft.</p> <p>Some major media organisations are already experimenting with drone technology, though. The BBC's research and development department has been <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/researchanddevelopment/2012/04/collab-soton-uav.shtml\" title=\"\">working with Southampton University</a> students to kit out a UAV with BBC broadcast cameras. And in Australia, where commercial drone activity has been licensed since 2002, the news programme 60 Minutes caused a stir last year when it flew a small UAV over an <a href=\"http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/newshome/9382555/spy-in-sky-over-island-camp/\" title=\"\">immigration detention centre</a>.</p> <p>But it's activists, academics and a small army of DIY drone enthusiasts who are really driving the nascent drone journalism movement. For example, during the Occupy Wall Street protests, a modified Parrot AR II drone, dubbed the \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/dec/21/occupy-wall-street-occucopter-tim-pool\" title=\"\">occucopter</a>\", was used to stream live footage over the internet. Protests in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3OB_4BT1LA\" title=\"\">Poland</a> and <a href=\"http://www.airpano.com/360Degree-VirtualTour.php?3D=Moscow-Bolotnaya-Square-Rally&amp;set_language=2\" title=\"\">Moscow</a> have also been filmed and photographed with drones.</p> <h2>Ethical questions</h2> <p>Of course, UAVs could also be used for less noble kinds of journalism, giving rise to a host of privacy and civil liberty issues. For example, one can easily imagine swarms of paparazzi drones following unfortunate celebrities, or hovering above their Hello-exclusive weddings. Nevertheless, Waite believes existing privacy laws will cover many of these eventualities.</p> <p>\"The question I often ask myself is this: is this a new ethical problem, or is this an old ethical problem involving new tools?\" He says the furore over the topless photographs of Kate Middleton illustrates the point. \"A lot of people beyond Buckingham Palace believe that was a pretty gross violation of privacy. So does the fact that a UAV could have been used change that at all? It doesn't.\"</p> <p>Matthew Schroyer, a drone and data journalist, and the founder of the <a href=\"http://www.dronejournalism.org/\" title=\"\">Professional Society of Drone Journalists</a>, has created a drone journalism <a href=\"http://www.dronejournalism.org/wiki/code-of-ethics\" title=\"\">code of ethics wiki</a> to encourage discussion of these issues. \"I think we can meet the challenge together as a group if we abide by codes of conduct,\" he says, adding: \"There's a lot of value to be had from these flying robots, as long as we use them ethically.\"</p> <p>Although drone journalism can't take off properly while commercial restrictions remain in place, Waite believes this is also a blessing in disguise. \"It [drone journalism] is not here yet because the law says it can't be,\" he says. \"But that's also a gift. The time we have between now and 2015 in the US, or anything from 2016 to 2020 in the EU, will give journalists the opportunity to really think about how they're going to use this technology.\"</p> <p>Duncan Jefferies is a <a href=\"http://www.duncanjefferies.co.uk/\" title=\"\">freelance journalist</a>.</p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"https://register.guardian.co.uk/media/\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up</strong></a><strong> for free membership to the </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Media Network</strong></a><strong>.

They said jets targeted Harat al-Shwam, a residential neighbourhood a few kilometres east of the capital which President Bashar al-Assad's forces had tried to storm, encountering stiff resistance. Sham News Network, an activist group, said jets also raided farmland adjacent to the northern Damascus neighbourhood of Barzeh and the city of Deir al-Zor in eastern Syria.&#xa0;The ceasefire has been marred by air raids and fighting and, on Sunday, veteran opposition campaigner <a href=\"http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/o0qANYo1n4A\">Fawaz Tello told Reuters it was \u201cpractically over\u201d</a>.

  "<p>When David Cameron made his keynote speech to the UN in September, he recognised property rights as one of the building blocks that take a country from poverty to prosperity. But for the vast majority of the world's poor, property rights or secure tenure are currently inaccessible.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.unhabitat.org/\" title=\"\">UN-Habitat</a>, only 30% of land in developing countries is regulated by some form of land registration system, and consequently 5 million people worldwide suffer forced evictions every year. With rapid urbanisation and slum development, where conventional tenure systems exist they simply cannot keep up.</p> <p>For many of the world's poorest communities \u2013 and particularly for women and indigenous groups within those communities \u2013 full titling to prove ownership of land is expensive and unattainable. Some governments have little experience of formulating and implementing land tenure policies.</p> <p>Demand for better access to land and for protection against eviction is increasing, yet large-scale, conventional individual land titling programmes are no longer appropriate. Although existing customary and religious land tenure systems are sometimes more accessible to local communities, they also have the tendency to discriminate against women and marginalised groups.</p> <p>The question is this: how can low income and vulnerable people access secure tenure? The answer requires inclusive, proactive and legal institutions and political structures \u2013 and the will.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.habitatforhumanity.org.uk\" title=\"\">Habitat for Humanity</a> is one of the 50 partners in UN-Habitat's <a href=\"http://www.gltn.net/\" title=\"\">global land tools network</a>, which is developing new approaches to ownership based on a continuum of land rights. Where previously residents would have only two options \u2013 undocumented, unrecognised informal land occupation or expensive, formal individual land titles \u2013 the network is trialling an approach that gives residents protection from eviction and is locally sensitive.</p> <p>The network is piloting a <a href=\"http://www.gltn.net/index.php/projects/social-tenure-domain-model\" title=\"\">social tenure domain model in Uganda</a>. It is using a survey, GPS system and a database to gather and analyse information, mapping community structures and facilities, family information, supporting documents and photos, and producing reports of the community and their land tenure situation.</p> <p>Part of the process is to build the capacity of the community in Uganda to input and update this system. The occupants are given a \"certificate of residency\" in recognition of their history within the space which gives them an address to access other services. Though it does not grant full land ownership, the certificate can be used to start a conversation with authorities on local planning and secure land tenure.</p> <p>Habitat for Humanity will be trialling the social tenure domain model in Bolivia and Brazil, where families have struggled for more than 20 years to access secure land tenure. The approach also have applications in countries such as Tajikistan where cultural constraints currently inhibit women's access to land tenure for housing. A system that recognises women's occupation in homes could start a process which then protects their tenancy.</p> <p>With land values rising, changing demographics, increasing inequalities and a growth in women-headed households, the traditional individual land titling system cannot deliver security of tenure to enough people within an acceptable time frame. The answer, I think, lies in changing the long unequal and unfair road of insecurity with new attitudes and policies to access secure tenure.</p> <p><em>Lisa Stead is assistant programme manager at </em><a href=\"http://www.habitatforhumanity.org.uk\" title=\"\"><em>Habitat for Humanity</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/housing/\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis, best practice and the latest jobs direct to you</strong></p>",

He denied that his massive liquidity schemes and promise of unlimited bond purchases would fuel inflation.</p> <p>Draghi also rejected claims that the European Central Bank has violated its mandate, and argued that German savers should be pleased, not alarmed \u2013 taxpayers might even make a profit on the ECB's bond purchases.</p> <p>A full transcript of the interview was <a href=\"http://www.ecb.int/press/key/date/2012/html/sp121029.en.html\">uploaded to the ECB's website this morning</a>. It begins with Spiegel inquiring whether the ex-Goldmanite has any savings (!) before giving Draghi a vigorous grilling.</p> <p>Here are some highlights.</p> <p>On sovereignty:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>SPIEGEL:</strong> Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has proposed giving the EU Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs a direct say in national budgets. What do you think of that proposal?</p> <p><strong>Draghi:</strong> I am fully in favour of it. Governments would be wise to seriously consider it. I firmly believe that, in order to restore confidence in the euro area, countries need to transfer part of their sovereignty to the European level.</p> <p><strong>SPIEGEL:</strong> But it is precisely that that many governments are unwilling to do. Why are they so against it?</p> <p><strong>Draghi:</strong> A lot of governments have yet to realise that they lost their national sovereignty a long time ago. Because, in the past, they have allowed their debt to pile up, they now need the goodwill of the financial markets. That sounds like a paradox, but it is nonetheless true: it is only once the euro area countries are willing to share sovereignty at the European level that they will gain sovereignty.</p> </blockquote> <p>And on German fears:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>SPIEGEL:</strong> In Germany, people have several reservations about your crisis policies. Were you surprised to receive so much criticism?</p> <p><strong>Draghi:</strong> I had the opportunity of a very deep and wide-ranging exchange of views with members of the Bundestag last Wednesday. My impression was that I was able to explain a number of issues, in particular how the measures comply with our mandate to safeguard our independence and to ensure price stability in the medium term.</p> <p><strong>SPIEGEL:</strong> This fear stems from historical experience. Germans have learnt that, if central banks flood the markets with money, this always leads to inflation.</p> <p><strong>Draghi:</strong> We have to take these fears very seriously. But the correlation is not so simple. In some cases, such as in the Weimar Republic, printing money caused inflation. But in other cases, proactive central bank action did not.</p> </blockquote> <p>Draghi is clearly keen to assuage German concerns \u2013 last Wednesday he spent two hours at the Bundestag answering MPs questions. <em>Preparing the ground before Angela Merkel seeks parliamentary approval for new support for Greece, Spain and/or Cyprus, perhaps....</em></p> </div>   </div>",
  "<p></p> <h2>Monday</h2> <h2>The Hospital That Stopped Caring \u2013 Panorama<br>8.30pm, BBC1</h2> <p>A Panorama report following up one of its more worthwhile investigations of recent times: the exposure of mistreatment of patients at the Winterbourne View private hospital near Bristol. The hospital is now closed, with 11 of its staff facing sentencing as we go to press, but as this sequel shows, the trauma suffered by their victims goes on. Continuing the public health theme, over on Channel 4, Dispatches asks whether the outsourcing of NHS services to the private sector is going to do anybody but the contractors any good. <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p> <h2>50 Years Of Bond Cars: A Top <br>Gear Special<br>9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>Yet more 007-related programming as Richard Hammond discovers the stories behind Bond cars, which happily turn out to be more about actual people. From director Guy Hamilton's revenge on traffic wardens (the revolving numberplates in Dr No), to London bus driver Maurice Patchett (who stunt-doubled for Roger Moore in Live And Let Die), and the story of how the Lotus Esprit became a Bond car, this is a an enjoyable hour, helped by Hammond's enthusiasm for the material. <em>Jonathan Wright</em></p> <h2>999: What's Your Emergency?<br>9pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>Blackpool's emergency services know all about alcohol and its consequences: with the town's reputation as a stag- and hen-party hub, the drunken behaviour at chucking-out time is really something to behold. \"A mixture between a zoo and Jeremy Kyle's waiting room,\" says one officer. But booze has more serious effects than idiots getting into fights: Blackpool is blighted by deprivation and associated alcohol abuse, and it's the prime cause of call-outs for all three emergency services, as is all too grimly illustrated here. <em>Martin Skegg</em></p> <h2>Wizards vs Aliens<br>5.15pm, CBBC</h2> <p>New offering from Russell T Davies, centred around the partnership of Tom, the most popular boy in school with a talent for magic, with nerdy alien enthusiast Benny. Despite a sense that a bunch of wizards have taken the wrong portkey and wandered into the world of Doctor Who, there is potential in this opening episode, in which Tom must battle against an invasion of magic-stealing aliens to save the wizarding world. Older viewers will appreciate a peppering of witty references to the show's magical precedents, particularly the presence of a certain \"chamber\" in the downstairs toilet. <em>Indigo Axford</em></p> <h2>How the Devil Got His Horns: <br>A Diabolical Tale<br>9pm, BBC4</h2> <p>Why does Satan look like he does? It's a question tackled by Alastair Sooke as he considers depictions of Old Nick in the centuries leading up to the Renaissance, an exploration that takes in Giotto and Dante, among others. The Devil, we learn, was once seen rather as a bureaucrat. In times of trouble, though, he gradually came to be represented as a monstrous figure, with physical characteristics borrowed from Egyptian deity Bes. But such representations couldn't survive people empathising with the notion of the Devil as a tragic fallen angel. <em>JW</em></p> <h2>Don't Sit In The Front Row<br>9pm, Sky Atlantic</h2> <p>Jack Dee hosts a new panel show in which three comics mine four pre-selected members of the audience for joke-worthy material. After round one, they ditch the punter with the least comic potential and keep going until one audience member is the \"winner\". Although it's not clear why. Heavy reliance on members of the public recounting anecdotes slows things, and even with editing, there's too much dead air between laughs. You want someone to release a caffeinated monkey into the studio just to liven things up a bit. <em>Julia Raeside</em></p> <p></p> <h2>Tuesday</h2> <h2>Autumnwatch<br>8pm, BBC2</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398561115\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/10/25/1351181745460/Autumnwatch-010.jpg\" alt=\"Autumnwatch\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michaela Strachan and Chris Packham in Autumnwatch.

They're based in the Scottish Highlands for four nights of live shows where anything \u2013 or indeed nothing \u2013 could happen. The beautiful location is ideal to showcase red squirrels scavenging, beavers getting ready for winter and a possible glimpse of the reclusive pine marten. Plus Packham gives a rundown on the wildlife winners and losers after the wettest summer for 100 years. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p> <h2>Operation Iceberg<br>9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>\"If you think icebergs are nothing more than floating chunks of ice, prepare to think again.\" The narration for this two-parter on the life cycle of icebergs is ridiculously macho \u2013 obviously the BBC have spent a lot of money and effort getting their team to the Arctic, so they're not going to let anyone forget how important and dangerous the venture is. But there is a lot to learn and wonder at: little is really known about icebergs, so the scientists and specialists, fronted by that man Packham again, are breaking new ground with their research, while the photography is suitably dramatic. Concludes Thursday. <em>MS</em></p> <h2>Jewish Mum Of The Year<br>9pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>They've had to organise a barmitzvah, hone their matchmaking skills, and rustle up a coach trip for 22 Jewish OAPs. In the final challenge, the two remaining Mums must lay on a Friday-night dinner of chicken soup for a party of 16, including David Baddiel and \u2013 no pressure \u2013 Jay Rayner. However, as the winner will become resident agony aunt with Jewish News, they must also prove their chutzpah on a radio phone-in. <em>Mazel tov</em> to them both. <em>AJC</em></p> <h2>Last Resort<br>8pm, Sky1</h2> <p>\"Just crazy enough,\" says one crew member to submarine captain Chaplin (Andre Braugher) after he has announced to the world that he's taking his nuclear sub, complete with crew and 18 Trident missiles, to a remote Pacific island and won't give them back 'til somebody gives him some answers. To questions like, why did a US ship apparently try to sink them? Just crazy enough also perfectly describes this pilot episode of the new US drama. A bonkers premise supported largely by Braugher's immense and capable shoulders \u2013 he's an acting exocet. <em>JNR</em></p> <h2>Horror Europa With Mark Gatiss<br>9pm, BBC4</h2> <p>In this excellent sequel to 2010's History Of Horror, Mark Gatiss lifts the coffin lid on those nations outside the Hollywood system and the British gothic tradition \u2013 suggesting that Europe's turbulent 20th century impacted on continental horror in fascinating ways; from the tormented expressionism of Germany's Dr Caligari to France's guilt-ridden Les Diaboliques. There's plenty of room for lesser-known curios too, such as Spain's Living Dead At The Manchester Morgue \u2013 plus a chat with Italian giallo maestro Dario Argento, director of gob-smacking, \"hyper-violent fairytale\" Suspiria. <em>AJC</em></p> <h2>American Horror Story: Asylum<br>10pm, FX</h2> <p>What is scary? This show still isn't sure, but it's going to have a damn good time finding out. After the anything-goes attitude of season one, the second outing is more focused, with the action confined to a spooky institution for the criminally insane. It's run by Jessica Lange, returning in a different role. Oh, and we're now in the 1960s. So far, it's more confusing than scary, but it's impressive how quickly they establish this new environment and fill it with great actors including James Cromwell and Sarah Paulson. <em>Phelim O'Neill</em></p> <p></p> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <h2>Brazil With Michael Palin<br>9pm, BBC1</h2> <p>\"I was born to swing from hooks,\" says Michael Palin. Not to worry, the eternally jolly traveller has simply come late in life to the joys of hammocks. As Palin explores Amazonia, one of these hammocks is slung up in a vast communal home shared by the Yanomami people, who manage to maintain a hunter-gatherer lifestyle in the 21st century. Elsewhere, Palin makes friends with pink river dolphins, sees the remains of Henry's Ford's efforts to guarantee rubber supplies for his company and grooves to tecno brega. <em>JW</em></p> <h2>How Safe Are Britain's Roads?<br>9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>In this two-part series, Justin Rowlatt and Anita Rani look at why the number of people harmed in traffic accidents is rising. After years of declining road casualties, the number of deaths is up \u2013 there were more injuries last year than make up the population of Northampton. Anita joins a police motorway patrol, while Justin takes his beaten-up people carrier to a test track to see how it compares with the latest technology. They also meet a Paralympian who says he wouldn't be in a wheelchair if he'd worn a seatbelt. <em>MS</em></p> <h2>Frankenstein: A Modern Myth<br>11.10pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>An insightful dissection of Mary Shelley's pioneering science fiction, pulling in references from 60s counterculture to Mel Brooks and Danny Boyle (whose stage production starred Benedict Cumberbatch). Her eloping with the married poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, who would become her husband, and holing up with Byron in the Swiss commune where her novel was spawned, was scandalous in its day. Born of such controversy, Frankenstein continues to resonate, we learn, in its examination of otherness and fear of technology. <em>BA</em></p> <h2>Unsafe Sex In The City<br>9pm, BBC3</h2> <p>BBC3's behind-the-scenes look at a Manchester sexual health clinic is hopefully making for an effective public-information film \u2013 once you get beyond the ewww factor, the serious consequences of unprotected sex are clearly apparent. This week, a 20-year-old porn actor gets some bad news from the STI clinic, a woman in her 30s is afraid of being left infertile after contracting chlamydia as a teenager, and housemates Martin and Marissa argue over who is responsible for an outbreak of scabies. If it sounds gross, it's meant to \u2013 the message is if you can't be safe, keep it zipped. <em>MS</em></p> <h2>Extreme Couponing: Holiday Hauls<br>9pm, Discovery Real Time</h2> <p>It's Boxing Day, and a dramatic voiceover follows a group of American bargain-lovers who are so obsessed with low prices they'll stop at nothing to raid the sales. \"If I'm five minutes late to the store, my whole game plan is off,\" says Joel, a teenager who should have better things to do. Faatima ropes in her long-suffering husband Brian, a sad man who shrugs: \"I'm a carrying tool.\" Meanwhile, Missy is so determined to fill her gift stockroom with a year's worth of presents for any occasion, she spends Christmas Day snipping coupons. All a bit weird. <em>HV</em></p> <h2>Getting On<br>10pm, BBC4</h2> <p>There's indecipherable streamlining going on at St Jude's, as the staff get \"cascade training\" \u2013 laden with meaningless buzzwords \u2013 from Damaris on saving energy and the new colour-coded (but not quite colour-coded enough) bags for the unspeakable waste that exudes from the wards. It's just what Den needs now that hypochondriac patient Mrs Dethick is back, and her pregnancy is beginning to weigh heavy. Meanwhile, Hilary is pinballing about the ward turning lights off. As ever, Jo Brand, Ricky Grover and Joanna Scanlan are pitch-perfect. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p> <p></p> <h2>Thursday</h2> <h2>Young Apprentice<br>8pm, BBC1</h2> <p>No one wants to be a train driver any more. Or a nurse. Kids would rather be synergising bleeding-edge strategic deliverables or something. This week another 12 youngsters \u2013 some of whom will have swallowed a marketing dictionary and will spend the next couple of months guffing out the results \u2013 ship out to Baron Sugar's Brentwood HQ in the hopes of winning \u00a325,000 to kickstart their own business. There's a trainee accountant, a fashion designer, and an events promoter all set for Grumpole of the Bailey's intensive school of tasks; they'd do well to remember that, unlike the adult version, the nice kids always win. <em>BA</em></p> <h2>Hunted<br>9pm, BBC1</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398561116\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/10/25/1351182753109/Hunted-010.jpg\" alt=\"Hunted\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hunted, BBC1. Photograph: Giles Keyte/BBC/Kudos</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giles Keyte/BBC/Kudos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As modern as it appears, with its thin laptops and cloned tracking devices, the appeal of Hunted is equally thanks to some old-school cold-war devices. Hypodermic needles, hidden rooms, clandestine meetings: were it not for all the mobile phone calls, this could be taking place in 1974. Even if the Russian doll nature of private espionage agent Sam Hunter's identity and fate remains a mystery, tonight's episode offers an excellent explanation of what \"Hourglass\" might be, and more of the show's customarily great set pieces. <em>JR</em></p> <h2>The Human Mannequin<br>9pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>Teenager Louise Wedderburn has a rare genetic condition known as FOP, which is slowly causing her muscle to turn into bone. Nevertheless, as this documentary shows, she's determined to make a career in one of the most image-conscious professions of all \u2013 fashion \u2013 and sets off to London for an internship at Elle. \"I don't want to be one of those people that let their illness get them down,\" she asserts. It's hugely touching and inspiring stuff. AJC</p> <h2>Family Guns<br>8pm, National Geographic</h2> <p>Hard to see what exactly is Geographic about this new series about a father-and-son firm of small-arms traders \u2013 cannon, rifles, flamethrowers, they've got the lot \u2013 who are always bickering in a staged way to camera because the old man can't bear to sell the choicest items in the inventory. It's essentially an excuse for sequences in which guys get to shoot off demonstration rounds of bullets, grinning with ejaculatory delirium as they do so. For boys and small men only. <em>David Stubbs</em></p> <h2>The Year The Town Hall Shrank<br>9pm, BBC4</h2> <p>A timely three-part series filmed over a year in Stoke-on-Trent, charting the reactions of local politicians and voters alike as spending cuts begin to bite. This opening episode begins in December 2010 with the reactions of councillors as they absorb a \u00a336m shortfall in council finances caused by an 8.1% cut in government funding. Stoke's council is arguably bloated \u2013 it's the city's biggest employer \u2013 but this is likely to prove little consolation to those who depend, one way or another, on its services. An absorbing study of politics at its most mundane, and most important. <em>AM</em></p> <h2>Scandal<br>9pm, More4</h2> <p>A cross between The Good Wife and Boston Legal, Scandal takes political/legal dilemmas and punches them up with snappy dialogue. You join us in the offices of Olivia Pope, whose legal firm specialises in making problems go away, and in tonight's episode, the problem turns out to be Washington DC's most high-end madam, keen to protect her client list in the face of an indictment. There's lots of fun as the coded \"menu\" of services is explained to members of the team, but when one client turns out to be the president's nominee for attorney general, this proves to be an assignment with implications that go all the way to the top. <em>JR</em></p> <p></p> <h2>Friday</h2> <h2>Jonathan And Charlotte<br>9pm, ITV1</h2> <p>The commercial success guaranteed by triumph on TV talent quests might well be one of the more baffling phenomena of our epoch but it shows few signs of slowing. Essex teenagers Jonathan &amp; Charlotte, despite being beaten into second place on Britain's Got Talent this year by a dancing dog, have managed to become reasonably \u2013 if fleetingly \u2013 famous for their classical crossover warblings. This hagiography recaps their story so far, with frequent reminders that they have an album out. <em>AM</em></p> <h2>Derren Brown: Apocalypse<br>9pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>Some Hollywood concepts are so bad that no director could reasonably expect their audience to succumb to suspension of disbelief, yet Darren Brown aims to breakdance where Michael Bay fears to tread in this, the concluding half of a two-part special. Last week introduced us to the stooge who'll find themselves believing they're one of a smattering of survivors from a meteor slamming into Earth; this closing part sees them bumble around a post-apocalyptic Blighty strewn with the undead. What ever happens, fingers crossed they don't just think \"when in Rome\" and tuck into the nearest noggin. <em>Mark Jones</em></p> <h2>The Mentalist<br>9pm, Channel 5</h2> <p>A new season, a new opportunity for this show to stretch out its long-standing case of the Red John serial killer. At least the team have caught Lorelei, Red John's accomplice, so we can surely expect a little headway. Yet the show is still torn between its long story arc and the more mundane case-of-the-week stuff, which tends to get in the way a bit. Taking up a chunk of time this week is a head-scratcher involving the murder of a hotel employee, which sees the CBI team grudgingly pair up with the FBI. <em>PO'N</em></p> <h2>Lang Lang: Live At The Roundhouse<br>7.30pm, BBC4</h2> <p>He's got a little Liszt. Actually, he's gotta whole lotta Listz: nine solo piano pieces from the Hungarian composer, including La Campanella and Un Sospiro, effortlessly performed by Chinese wunderkind Lang Lang at Camden Town's renowned Roundhouse as part of last year's iTunes festival. It's followed by Lang Lang: The Art Of Being A Virtuoso, a behind-the-scenes doc following the seemingly 12-fingered young prodigy through China, the US and Europe, as he discusses which composers caught his ear in his formative years. Guessing that'll be Listz, then. <em>AJC</em></p> <h2>Modern Family<br>8pm, Sky1</h2> <p>Claire's big plans for Halloween, her favourite of all the holidays, are stymied by the neighbours after one of her previous spook-taculars proved a little too shocking for the more faint-hearted local residents. Phil declares an open house, which may test Claire's promise not to scare. Meanwhile, Jay and Manny have to deal with true horror as they face a hot- and cold-running Gloria whose pregnancy hormones are running wild. A reminder of what a shame it is that British shows don't do Halloween specials. <em>PO'N</em></p> <h2>Taste Off<br>9pm, Discovery Real Time</h2> <p>Frisky London chef Aaron Craze holds his fists aloft in a gesture reminiscent of a gooning 90s TV presenter and challenges locals to a taste off. It's a bold move that sees the ex-Fifteen employee learn from chefs around the world and then add his own twist on their dishes. Although he doesn't always win the challenge, and looks suitably gutted when he fails, Craze has every reason to be cocky as he gives Mexican food an Italian twist by making tortilla into tortellini. Also on the menu: blue corn quesadilla, alcoholic cactus juice and taco with coriander foam. <em>HV</em></p>",
  "<p>Coming back after the half-term break attentions will soon start to focus on the inevitable excesses of Christmas - parties, presents and food. So it's an ideal time to look at how, as individuals, schools and communities we can take small steps locally to try and solve global environmental problems such as growing and buying local foods and fashions, conserving and protecting precious resources and looking at ways we can generate power through cleaner, renewable sources.</p> <p>To help we have trawled through the resources on the Guardian Teacher Network and come up with our top pick of lessons and activities.

They'll now host RSL next weekend, before traveling to Salt Lake for the second leg - that was a great semi final last year. Hope this year's version lives up to it. And let's hope Eddie Johnson's alright to play.</p> <p>LA meanwhile, move on to host the Whitecaps in the wild card game on Thursday night. I'll be here for that. And also for Chicago vs Houston on Wednesday night - hurricane/trick-or-treaters permitting. Hope you'll join me for those.

Keane was moving well to present a target, and Beckham did sort of Beckham-y things - actually doing what he's done a fair amount in the latter part of the year by often choosing the modest option to the team mate in space, rather than the raking crossfield ball.&#xa0;</p> <p>Possession and tempo ebbed and flowed a little.

Beckham and Donovan were listed as doubtful before the game, but Arena clearly feels they need the minutes before Thursday, so both start - with Buddle and Keane up top.</p> <p>Steve Zakuani took a nasty knock last week that scared a few fans mindful of the injury he'd just recovered from, but supposedly him coming off the field was precautionary and he was back in training almost immediately - no start for him tonight though.

But as the future you knows, the season was still to take a few twists and turns before depositing us here at the Home Depot Center on the eve of the playoffs. In fact in the build up to the goal above, there\u2019s some foreshadowing, in the news that first choice keeper Michael Gspurning had picked up a knock that turned out to be significant enough to keep him out for several games and give the Sounders their most indifferent run of the season (they went 3-4-6 in his absence, including a 9 game winless streak). Still, you don\u2019t know that yet. But you will.

Santos did for their Champions League ambitions with an emphatic second leg dismantling in Mexico, while Sporting KC stopped them winning their fourth consecutive US Open Cup. They\u2019ve had a solid Champions League campaign again this Fall and are into the quarter finals with minimum fuss, but the pressure to finally deliver an MLS Cup has been compounded by disappointment elsewhere.</p> <p>Eddie Johnson has had a good season in the end, breaking back into the national team and breaking the club season scoring record held by Fredy Montero, but he and Montero have sometimes given the impression of the town not being big enough for the both of them.&#xa0;</p> <p>That said both of them have very happy memories of their games against the Galaxy this season - particularly the remarkable dismantling of LA in Seattle on August 5th.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guDonZBJDgY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/guDonZBJDgY?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-29T00:44:28.173Z\">at 12.44am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-508dd038b5793e5495b451f8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-29T00:39:20.775Z\">12.39am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">LA Galaxy</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As we mentioned LA know what they need to do to get to MLS Cup and chances are they\u2019ll have to do it very differently than their run to MLS Cup last year, where a single game Western Conference Final and the knowledge that MLS Cup was being held at the Home Depot Center meant that having negotiated New York in the second leg of the Western conference semi-final (don\u2019t ask) the stars were perfectly aligned for the Galaxy to win it in front of their fans, which they duly did. This year though, their woeful start to the season has meant that despite decent form recently, the only way they\u2019re going to be hosting MLS Cup again this year is via a win today (for starters) and Houston Dynamo finding a way past Chicago, Sporting KC and DC or New York, for an unlikely repeat of last year\u2019s final.</p> <p>Stranger things have happened of course, but for that even to be a possibility the Galaxy have to beat the Whitecaps, beat the Earthquakes (with the second leg in San Jose), then beat either Seattle or RSL (again with the second leg on the road). And they have to score against Seattle - which they haven't done in their two meetings this year...</p> <p>Not much home field boost in that mix then - but the Galaxy did get some small encouragement in that area this week, with news that for the Vancouver game at least, an agreement had been reached that an exception could be made to the usually stringent midweek noise regulations that place severe numerical restrictions on crowd attendances at the Home Depot Center. The stadium is in the middle of the Cal State Dominguez Hills campus, and everyone knows students love an early night.</p> <p><strong>First tweet</strong> - and Andy Gillooley fancies the Galaxy's chances, Here's his take on tonight</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AndyGillooley/status/262710116208504832\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-in-reply-to=\"262709623683940352\"><p>@<a href=\"https://twitter.com/kidweil\">kidweil</a> @<a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnussports\">gdnussports</a> Think <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23WhitecapsFC\">#WhitecapsFC</a> might be praying for injuries today.

A win today would take them from 7th overall seed to 3rd - giving them second leg home advantage in their conference semi-final against Real Salt Lake, and perhaps just as importantly, ensuring that should they manage to negotiate their way through the West they would be seeded to host MLS Cup against all but overall number two seed Sporting KC, of the potential Eastern opponents. A draw tonight could leave them with potential final trips to DC or New York, while a loss would mean a potential visit to Chicago. And while we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves with talk of finals, it is relevant that the Sounders are decent on the road, but rather more decent in front of 60,000 plus in Seattle.</p> <p>The Galaxy, meanwhile, know how their path to a repeat MLS Cup starts - with a home wild card game against Vancouver Whitecaps on Thursday night. Interesting to see what selection Bruce Arena goes with tonight, with that game and a possible semi-final first leg a few days later in mind (and Beckham and Donovan needing game time after injuries). Seems like only yesterday we were discussing Arena\u2019s handling of his squad for the three games that made up their opening week. But those games, and the sight of David Beckham wading through ticker tape in Toronto, were actually one long season and a gazillion Chris Wondolowski goals ago.&#xa0;</p> <p>I\u2019ll be back shortly with more build up and team news shortly.
