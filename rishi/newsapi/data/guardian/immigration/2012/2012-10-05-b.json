Celebrating and drawing on the lives of Salford's multicultural population, and exploring communication, the show takes the form of a series of absurd encounters aiming to highlight what happens when language fails us but we still need to find ways to talk to each other. The show is produced in association with the Lowry and Walk The Plank, and director Mel Cook has worked with both Coney and Hide&amp;Seek as well as creating work for the Shunt Vaults, so he's well-versed in creating immersive theatre in a distinct setting.</p> <p><strong><em>Book via The Lowry, Sat to 28 Oct</em></strong></p> <p><em>Lyn Gardner</em></p> <h2>The White House Murder Case, London</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397242211\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/5/1349440174163/The-White-House-Murder-Ca-008.jpg\" alt=\"The White House Murder Case\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The White House Murder Case</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the run-up to the US election, the Orange Tree stages a dark American satirical thriller on politics, war and spin that was written in 1970 but set 40 years in the future (ie now). The author of The White House Murder Case was cartoonist, playwright and novelist Jules Feiffer, winner of an Oscar and the Pulitzer prize. His play deals with a nerve gas that's released by mistake, killing 750 soldiers. The most pressing question quickly becomes how to spin this to the voting public ahead of the poll when the country is at war and the president's wife is a goddamn peacenik; it's complicated further when a murder is committed. The production is directed by Christopher Morahan (best known for TV's The Jewel In The Crown), who also tackled Feiffer's play Little Murders for the RSC in 1967.</p> <p><strong><em>Orange Tree Theatre, Richmond, Wed to 10 Nov</em></strong></p> <p><em>Mark Cook</em></p> <h2>American Idiot, Southampton</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397242212\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/5/1349440307603/American-Idiot-008.jpg\" alt=\"American Idiot\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: John Daughtry</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Daughtry</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Green Day singer-guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong may have recently checked into rehab after an onstage strop but it won't make much difference here: the band were never slated to appear in this adaptation of their 2004 concept album which took its inspiration from the Who's Tommy and Jesus Christ Superstar. Heading off on a seven-week tour across the UK and Ireland, the show repackages the American punk band's songs and lyrics into the tale of three young men trying to discover themselves and the meaning of life.

Elegy is devised and directed by Douglas Rintoul and is based on the testimony of gay Iraqi refugees fleeing to Syria to escape homophobic persecution in their home country. Actor Jamie Bradley tells the story of a refugee crossing the no man's land of empty train stations and bomb-blasted towns; a man wanted neither by his own country or anyone else's. It's a compassionate study of a person enduring brutality, fear and exploitation, performed on a bed of more than 700 items of discarded men's clothes, representing the amount of homophobic murders by militia groups (plus family-perpetrated \"honour\" killings) in \"liberated\" Iraq.</p> <p><strong><em>Theatre 503, SW11, Tue to 3 Nov</em></strong></p> <p><em>MC</em></p> <h2>Lighthearted Intercourse, Bolton</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397242214\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/5/1349441120119/Light-Hearted-Intercourse-008.jpg\" alt=\"Light Hearted Intercourse\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Light Hearted Intercourse</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bolton's Bill Naughton was a great chronicler of everyday life and had huge success with plays including Spring And Port Wine and Alfie.

  "<p>On a recent visit to my in-laws my wife's mother revealed that she&#xa0;had discovered a large collection of old family photographs. The images, printed on yellowing squares of paper, were mostly taken during the 1920s and 30s and featured her parents and grandparents.</p> <p>In these pictures they were still young \u2013 relaxing at the seaside and sitting in their back garden. It was fascinating to pore over them, but alongside that fascination I felt a pang of regret that, while my wife knows so much about her family history, I know so little about my own.</p> <p>My family's origins are in the villages of rural northern Pakistan. There is no record of where or when my grandparents were born, no documents that detail their lives, and no certificates that document their deaths. There are no memorials that mark where they are buried.</p> <p>With my father dead, the few shards of biography available come through the scrappy recollections of my 79-year-old mother. If the lives of my grandparents are a blur, the lives of my&#xa0;parents are scarcely more distinct. My parents married sometime around 1960 \u2013 there is no photograph of the wedding day and my mother cannot recall the precise date \u2013 before my father left for Britain in early 1963, leaving behind his wife and two very young children.</p> <p>My father visited Pakistan twice while he was in Britain, and I was conceived during one of those trips. I was born in 1971 and was almost three when I arrived in Britain with my mother and siblings. There is virtually no photographic record of the years my mother spent in Pakistan. She tells me stories of what I was like as a baby, but in the absence of images \u2013 there are only two photographs, both studio shot, of me as a baby \u2013 it is hard to believe I ever lived in Pakistan.</p> <p>I remember as a teenager being filled&#xa0;with an aching envy at seeing my&#xa0;white friends' family albums: photographs of grandparents' wedding days, grandfathers in military uniforms, scenes of parents as small children. My friends took these things for granted but I was acutely aware of the impact of not having such images. I did not, at the time, recognise the irony of my predicament. I was born in Pakistan, a&#xa0;country only 24 years older than I was: Indians had 5,000 years of history to draw on, Pakistanis had fewer than five decades. We, the children of Pakistani immigrants, were doubly adrift \u2013 torn from a country that&#xa0;had itself been torn from another country. Faced with the richness of my friends' histories, I was stung by my own poverty.</p> <p>The 11 years my mother spent in Pakistan without my father went undocumented. There are photographs, though, of my father's stay in Britain, living in a succession of houses he shared with fellow Pakistani men. They offer tantalising glimpses of my father, not as a father but as a man. I can see him standing by a cooker stirring a pot. He is wearing an apron over his shirt and tie while another man, more casually dressed, looks on. I&#xa0;can see him seated at a table, again in a tie, preparing to eat with three other men. I see him gazing at the camera in sunglasses, his hands casually slipped into the pockets of a cream suit. Dad doesn't look like the newly arrived immigrant who was working in a poorly paid manual job: he looks dignified, he looks cool. He does not look like the man I remember when I was growing up.</p> <p>In the photographs I have from those years, my father seems a sociable fellow \u2013 he is usually in the company of other men (never any women). While we were in Pakistan, these were the men my father was living with. These men got to spend the 60s with him, they knew him intimately. And I have no idea who they are, or what happened to them.</p> <p>Why does this lack of photographs of my mother's life in Pakistan still matter after all these years? Why do the faces in the photographs from my father's life in Britain haunt me so?</p> <p>In part, it is because photographs can help to give context and colour to the past; relatives who are long-dead, or whom we view only through a rigid parental prism, or through the fog of memory are revealed as fully fleshed, vital human beings. It is not easy to feel rooted when one is drowning in a&#xa0;sea of unknowns.</p> <p>I have become progressively more aware of the significance of my ignorance. My father died in 1995, I got married in 2010 and my daughter was born the following year. All three of those events were life-defining \u2013 they were reminders that, while we are all individuals, we are also bound to others: links in a chain, chapters in an ongoing story. After my father's death I&#xa0;became fascinated with learning more about him as a man; the questions I&#xa0;never asked while he was alive became more urgent.</p> <p>After I married, I became aware of how alive the past was for my wife \u2013 she had photographs, her parents' journals of family holidays, baby clothes and toys, paintings made by relatives \u2013 and how distant it was for&#xa0;me.</p> <p>When my baby daughter Laila was born, my desire to learn about my ancestors grew because she has parents with wildly different cultural heritages. I wanted her to feel equally versed in both stories.</p> <p>And so I yearn to flick through the back pages of my family history to know about my ancestors, to know what they looked like and what they were like, but the pages are mostly blank and the photographs that do exist only prompt unanswerable questions. The contrast with my wife's family could scarcely be greater. Bridget has photographs of everyone from her great-grandparents down: she knows that her great-grandmother was a music-hall entertainer whose show was reviewed in the Stage newspaper in 1901; there are records of a relative who was a member of parliament and&#xa0;another ancestor who moved to New York. I have tiny fragments of information about my ancestors \u2013 a&#xa0;grandfather who served in Burma, a&#xa0;great-grandfather also in the military \u2013 but these are scraps compared with Bridget's banquet.</p> <p>This explains my almost pathological desire to record and keep everything. I&#xa0;had a teenage diary, I have ancient cinema stubs, airline tickets and I&#xa0;never, ever throw away old concert T-shirts. It is not hoarding for hoarding's sake \u2013 I am trying to compensate for having nothing from the past by keeping everything for the future.</p> <p>My dilemma is not unique \u2013 it is the typical experience of many second-generation British Asians \u2013 and it is a problem that a recently launched website called <a href=\"http://whosthedaadi.com/\" title=\"\">whosthedaadi.com</a> is hoping to address. The idea behind it is&#xa0;that British Asian families can learn more about their ancestors through crowd-sourced information: people are&#xa0;encouraged to upload old family photographs complete with any details to help build family trees. It is a great idea and I hope it is successful.</p> <p>In my own case, I fear it is too late. In&#xa0;Pakistan, the relatives of my parents' generation are largely gone and they have taken their memories with them. I also suspect that I will never learn the truth about the men in the photographs with my father. All I can do is to stare hard at them, at their pale brown jackets and thick sideburns, at my father in his regulation suit, tie and dark sunglasses. All I can do is wish fervently that those photographs could talk, and wonder what they might say.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Follow Sarfraz on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarfrazmanzoor\" title=\"\"><em>@sarfrazmanzoor</em></a></p>",
  "<p>The gates outside <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/charlotte-church\" title=\"\">Charlotte Church</a>'s house are huge, heavy and automated. I press the intercom, but there is no answer. So I stare through the slats up the long, winding drive and acres of garden. There is no sign of the house. This is about as private as private residences get.</p> <p>Once you know about Church's history, it begins to make sense. It's not that the former child singer announced she wanted to be alone and retreated from the world. Far from it: she loved her friends, her family, and was wedded to her community in Cardiff. No, Church was hounded into privacy. This is the girl for whom a clock was devised, counting down to her 16th birthday, when she would be \"legal\"; who was labelled promiscuous despite the fact that, at 26, she says she still has only ever had four boyfriends. This is the girl portrayed as a&#xa0;chav, a binge drinker, a fallen angel, a symbol of everything wrong with modern Britain. For others in her family, it was even worse. In February this year, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/feb/23/charlotte-church-phone-hacking-case\" title=\"\">Church and her parents accepted \u00a3600,000 in damages and costs after Rupert Murdoch's News International admitted that Church's voicemail messages were targeted repeatedly over a number of years</a>, and that it had unlawfully obtained and published private medical information about her and her mother.</p> <p>Given all that, perhaps the only surprise is that the gates aren't topped with barbed wire. Eventually, they open slowly, and ominously. I&#xa0;walk up the drive, half expecting to&#xa0;be frisked by heavies, but there's just a gardener mowing the lawn. So&#xa0;I walk some more, past kids' toys and footballs and a wendy house. \"Hi-yyyaa,\" Church shouts. She's in tracky bottoms, scruffy T-shirt, no makeup, chipped nails, and looks perfectly lovely.</p> <p>At an age when many young people are still living with their parents or dusting away their student days, Church has lived a dauntingly full life. It's not just the 10m records she had sold by 2007, nor the \u00a325m she was said to be worth in 2003 (now down to an estimated \u00a310m), nor her stint as <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-charlotte-church-show\" title=\"\">a very funny chatshow host</a> when she had just turned 20; it's also the relationship with rugby player <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/gavin-henson\" title=\"\">Gavin Henson</a>, their two children, the separation, the way she combines motherhood with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/sep/25/charlotte-church-review\" title=\"\">a new music career as an indie rocker</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/nov/28/leveson-inquiry-witnesses-smears-lies\" title=\"\">her impressive appearance in front of the Leveson inquiry</a> into hacking and, as a result, now her role as a patron of the pressure group <a href=\"http://hackinginquiry.org/\" title=\"\">Hacked Off</a>.</p> <p>A week earlier, we had met at a Rough Trade shop in east London, where she was showcasing her new EP. The audience was 30-strong, and seemed to consist mainly of people who worked in the shop and Church's friends \u2013 it couldn't have been further removed from the height of her teen fame, when she performed for the Pope or in front of 20,000 at the Hollywood Bowl. She sang half a dozen songs barefoot on a tiny stage, accompanied by a band (including her boyfriend on guitar), screaming, screeching, whispering and harmonising \u2013 part Bj\u00f6rk, part Radiohead \u2013 and having the time of her life. A pattern soon emerged. \"This is one I wrote after reading a piece in the Daily Mail,\" she said. \"Needless to say, I was pissed off.\" Then she introduced us to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGLIk4BPPWc\" title=\"\">Beautiful Wreck</a>, a song about exploitation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397595246\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349276069068/Charlotte-Church-1999-008.jpg\" alt=\"Charlotte Church, 1999\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Church in Voice Of An Angel in 1999. Photograph: George Bodnar </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Church's story was always going to be tabloid gold \u2013 the working-class Welsh girl who sang like an angel and would be our own <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Callas\" title=\"\">Maria Callas</a>. Even better, it was a story peopled with irresistible characters \u2013 the pushy mum, the father who wasn't the biological father, the grandad who played guitar and had met the Beatles, the aunt who fancied her chances at stardom, the tough manager, the liability boyfriends, and on it went.</p> <p>I once read an interview with Church when she was 14 in which the writer described her as \"the most fearsomely balanced, joined-up teenager you could meet\". I ask her if that rings true. She nods. \"Yeah, yeah. Fearsomely balanced \u2013 because you've got to work to maintain any sort of balance.\" Even when she was at her most exposed, she says, she never considered herself unbalanced. \"I've never been off the rails in my entire life.\"</p> <p>Right from the off, she was misrepresented, she says. We were led to believe she was fantastically ambitious, and her mother even more so. Rubbish, Church says. The only reason she got noticed in the first place was because she turned up with her aunt, who was taking part in a talent contest. When she did become successful, the story is that it ruined her. Again, she says, that's rubbish. She had a wonderful time \u2013 travelling the world, always with her mother, Maria, in Washington one day, at&#xa0;the Vatican the next. She even sat one of her GCSEs in the White House, where she had been performing for <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/1125614.stm\" title=\"\">George Bush's inauguration</a> and wondered why there were so many protestors. Looking back now, she says, it's not her proudest moment politically, but it was still thrilling.</p> <p>And when she wasn't gigging, she was back at school leading a normal life. Did the other kids bully her about her fame? You've got to be joking, she says. They couldn't care less, and they were her mates, anyway. \"You can't forget how self-involved teenagers are. I was 14 and doing massive concerts and selling shit-tonnes of albums, and I'd get back and they'd be like, 'Whatever\u2026 So-and-so snogged so-and-so the other week,' who was going out with so-and-so. They'd fill me in on everything that was going on. That was the most important thing.\" Things couldn't have been better, she says.</p> <p>So what did go wrong? In 2000, her mother sacked her manager <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/jul/10/jonathan-shalit-mediaguardian-100-2009\" title=\"\">Jonathan Shalit</a>; he eventually received an estimated \u00a32m in an out-of-court settlement. The press monstered Maria. \"That was when it turned, and I thought, this is really ugly.\"</p> <p>Church insists her mother was simply looking after her \u2013 she claims Shalit exploited her financially (he received 40% of her royalties from record sales) and says she did not enjoyed dealing with him. \"He was just\u2026 odd. I said to my mother, 'If I&#xa0;have to work with that man another day, I'm not singing another note,' and she said, 'OK.' The press turned it into this stereotypical situation where she was the pushy mother.\"</p> <p>But Maria wasn't portrayed simply as pushy, but as greedy and mad, too, wasn't she? \"Yes. But what she essentially was is strong as hell, because she wasn't going to let anyone overwork me or not let me have a normal childhood. They called her the Welsh dragon, and she was a dragon in a certain sense, but it was only to protect her young.\"</p> <p>By this time, Church had already found herself in a compromising clinch with the tabloid press. At 13, she was asked to sing at Rupert Murdoch's wedding in New York. Her management was told she could either be paid \u00a3100,000 or she \"would be looked upon favourably by Mr Murdoch's papers\". It sounds like an episode of the Sopranos, I say.</p> <p>She smiles. \"It is very mob, isn't it? I didn't have a clue who he was. I was told he's a really important man, he'll be able to help your career, and that didn't even matter to me. I wasn't ambitious. I've never been ambitious.\"</p> <p>She was flown from LA to New York on Murdoch's private jet. \"It was unbelievable. The taps were gold.\" What was the wedding like? \"I thought everybody looked ridiculous because they had all this finery on, but no shoes, because it was antique wood on the boat. There was this young bride, Wendi Deng, and I remember thinking, she's really beautiful and he's really old. That is what my 13-year-old brain said to me.\"</p> <p>Murdoch asked her to sing <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn4sXY2u9xg\" title=\"\">Pie&#xa0;Jesu</a>, which she did reluctantly after telling his people it was inappropriate. \"I said, 'Well, it's a requiem \u2013 was he sure?' Apparently he was insistent. I&#xa0;remember there were these huge, chocolate-covered strawberries, and he dropped the ring and all his aides came to help him find it \u2013 all these people in their finery with no shoes on searching for a ring!\"</p> <p>When did she find out why she'd performed for him? \"After the event, because I remember this \u00a3100,000 or favours being floated about, and me and my mother were like, 'No way, that's a&#xa0;phenomenal amount of money. No way are we turning that money down. Who is he? Who cares?' I'd much rather have just taken his money and invested it wisely, to be honest.\" She told Lord Leveson that her management persuaded her to accept the promise of favours.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397595247\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349276939913/Charlotte-Church-and-Gavi-008.jpg\" alt=\"Charlotte Church and Gavin Henson\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charlotte Church with ex-boyfriend Gavin Henson in 2006.

So many stories appeared about Church's private life, from the insignificant to the major, that she began to doubt her friends. \"We knew we were watched, there were always journalists outside, whether it was my nan's house, my parents' house, my house. They'd follow me everywhere. We'd say, 'I swear they've got a bug in the house.' But you think that's so far-fetched. It makes you a bit paranoid. You look at people around you, and question everybody.\" She had a&#xa0;close-knit group of friends who had never given her reason to distrust them, but she started to anyway. \"I did cull certain people. I just cut them from my life.\" She says she has recently been back in touch with some of them and apologised.</p> <p>Awful though it was, Church always felt strong enough to look after herself. Yes, she was aware of the countdown clock to her 16th birthday (she says it was in the Sun and on two websites, while the Sun disputes that, saying it merely reported on its existence on a website), but tried to ignore it. \"They were digging on the whole virginity issue\u2026 and the whole of my developing body was just beneath the surface.\" Not that much beneath, I&#xa0;say. \"No, not really,\" she says quietly. \"I read bits and bobs, and it was like, yeuchh.\"</p> <p>How did it make her feel? \"I'm the kind of person who laughs off everything publicly, because I've always been in public and you can't go around wailing. Probably behind closed doors it made me&#xa0;weird out a bit \u2013 to be talked about as a&#xa0;commodity, like you're some kind of geisha.\"</p> <p>It was during this period that she read an interview she had given to the Times in which it was suggested that she had expected red carpet treatment when she visited Ground Zero after 9/11. She was devastated to be portrayed as a callous prima donna, and it didn't do much for her career in America. But she was advised to say nothing, and was determined it would not break her.</p> <p>At 18, she was old enough to drink in a pub, so the press turned her into an alcoholic. Was she drinking? \"Yes!\" She sounds shocked at the idea that she might not have been. \"I was 18, 19. I went to Ibiza on my first holiday with the girls. We were totally reasonable, we had a little villa, we went out, we had a great time. We didn't hurt anyone's feelings, we didn't get into trouble.\" Again, the fallen angel was too good a story to spurn, even if it wasn't true. \"This whole thing was going on at the time \u2013 look at our youth, binge drinking, wasting their lives. It was just a great way to point a finger and make me one of the figureheads.\"</p> <p>Did she ever puke publicly? \"No&#xa0;puking. I fell over on my 18th birthday because there were about 50 photographers in front of me flashing; they'd try to trip you up to&#xa0;get the under-skirt shot, and shout abuse at you to get a reaction.\"</p> <p>A couple of years later, when she was in her first trimester and had not yet told her parents, she read about her pregnancy in the Sun under the headline Church Sober Shock. Again, she found it traumatic, but knew she'd have to make the best of it.</p> <p>It was when newspapers began to pry into the life of her vulnerable mother that she knew things were out of control. In December 2005, the News of the World reported that Maria had attempted suicide. The deliberately misleading front-page splash was \"Church's 3-In-A-Bed Cocaine Shock\", accompanied by a photograph of the singer, while the first sentence read, \"Superstar Charlotte Church's mum tried to kill herself because her husband is a love rat hooked on cocaine and three-in-a-bed orgies.\"</p> <p>In her statement to Leveson, Church said what the paper failed to tell its readers was that the suicide attempt was \"at the very least in part due\u2026 to the fact that she was aware this story was coming out\". Maria went on to further self-harm after the story broke because of the impact it had on her. \"Her main concern was her parents, my grandparents, and the shame of it all \u2013 you know, we come from a Catholic family.\"</p> <p>And the information had been obtained through hacking? \"Yes, that was entirely through hacking. Even our priest was hacked, Father Richard, who was helping both of my parents deal with this at the time.\" Her parents came through it, she says, despite the newspapers.</p> <p>Church is convinced we've not heard the end of hacking \u2013 that there's more to come out. She says so many newspapers wrote stories about her based on private information, and has started digging around herself for clues to their origin.</p> <p>It's almost lunchtime, and Church is driving to the school and nursery where her kids have just started. Does she ever ask herself whether success was worth all this? \"All the time. How do you get out of it? You can't. I didn't really think about not being famous, because I'd hardly known a time I&#xa0;wasn't. I was 12 when it started, so it just felt like, 'This is life, this is what it is.' It wasn't like, 'I can opt out.' I didn't think like that. Now I&#xa0;do. Now I&#xa0;think this is an option; I can disappear.\"</p> <p>Did she consider living in another country? \"This is the thing. The record company wanted me to go to America and my family wanted to go&#xa0;to America, but I didn't. I wanted to stay in Wales where all my family and friends were. I love this country, and I just thought, fuck you, I'm not getting chased out. This is my home.\"</p> <p>She spots one of her friends pushing two babies down the street, beeps at her and opens the window. \"'Kaiiiiiiia! It's me! You OK? Ta-ra.' She's one of my best friends. I went round to hers yesterday. We had a little party with the kids.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397595248\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349276611808/Charlotte-Church-performs-008.jpg\" alt=\"Charlotte Church performs with her band in 2012\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Church plays with her band at an ice-cream parlour in 2012. Photograph: Rex</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In some ways Church is still so girly that it's hard to believe 15 years have passed since her TV debut. At the same time, she seems older than her 26 years. She says she's changed recently. \"You know what? Leveson had a big impact. I&#xa0;became a lot more socially aware, and I'm just much more empowered. Also, putting an end to such a long chapter of my life, it made me a little freer, able to focus and re-evaluate. I've turned into a massive feminist, as well.\"</p> <p>Has motherhood changed her? \"Yeah. I've always been mature, but I think it's made me more emotional and responsible. And more caring. You want to be as safe as you can possibly be, so that when you go this world is OK, bearable, for your children to grow up in.\"</p> <p>Does she share the parenting with Henson? \"We've got a good relationship. We're both going tonight to an introductory parents' evening for the school\u2026 Oh, <em>shiiiiiit!</em> I'm in the wrong lane.\" She apologises to the driver she's heading straight towards. \"Sorrrrrrrry\u2026 Gavin has two overnights a week. It works pretty well when you've got two people who want the best for their children and can leave other baggage behind.\"</p> <p>It's funny, she says, she's so often been headline news, but she actually hates causing a stink. She does have the knack, though, I say. She grins. There's the time, for example, she called the Pope a Nazi, and just recently she referred to the Queen as an \"old woman\" who \"had no idea what's going on\", for which she apologised. \"I really don't like confrontation, believe it or not. I've just got strong opinions\u2026 They're easy to come by.\" Ask her what she thinks and she'll tell you. And sometimes she'll tell you even when&#xa0;you don't.</p> <p>We collect the kids, who have spent the morning making bread and bring their little rolls home. The two are jabbering away in the back of the car. \"Dexter, stop messing with that, please,\" Church says as her three-year-old son contemplates escaping his seat belt. \"Dexter Lloyd!\" Her voice is rising, half cajoling, half threatening.</p> <p>\"You went through a red light,\" five-year-old Ruby says.</p> <p>\"I didn't, darling. It was green, honest.\"</p> <p>We get home and the huge gates slowly open. \"Nilsson!\" she shouts in delight as a labradoodle bounds up to her. \"Niiiiilsson! He's named after the singer Harry Nilsson.\"</p> <p>Church's boyfriend, Jonny Powell, emerges in his pyjamas. He is an old family friend who used to work in her mother's pub. \"Sorry, I'd forgotten you were coming. I would have dressed a little bit more appropriately,\" he says as he shows me round the garage studio.</p> <p>\"He's a scholar, that boy,\" Church says proudly when he disappears. \"He's a smart, smart boy \u2013 he got a scholarship to the Royal College of Music. He's a solo artist, released two albums, brilliant musician, and great with the kids.\" She says she plans to have a couple more children with Powell.</p> <p>In the kitchen, the band are eating sandwiches and discussing everything from American indie band Fatty Acids to string theory and the suicide of novelist David Foster Wallace. We could be in the world's smartest student house. Church always planned to go to university \u2013 when she was young, she wanted to be a vet or a lawyer \u2013 but it never quite worked out. Most of the band have been, and tell her it's not all it's cracked up to be.</p> <p>A couple of weeks later, we meet in a small room above a pub where she is playing that night. The band are chatting away and eating fruit, just as they were round her kitchen table. Church looks happy. She says it's taken a&#xa0;while,&#xa0;but she finally feels she has found herself musically. When I&#xa0;say the music reminds me of&#xa0;a demented Radiohead, she lights up. \"I love that! Thank you! I love Radiohead. Yeah, it's been a long journey, but often I think it takes until you're in your 20s to&#xa0;find your thing.\"</p> <p>Would she enjoy the level of success now that she experienced as a teenager? \"No. You&#xa0;get stalkers and that kind of stuff. I'd love to have a steady, reasonably sized fan base so it's profitable and I can always make music in a&#xa0;way I want to.\" She has an idyllic image of herself making music in the garage while the kids are at school, then touring with the family in school holidays.</p> <p>She's also becoming more active as a patron of&#xa0;Hacked Off, and will be talking at the Conservative party conference this week. It's&#xa0;all&#xa0;very well having an inquiry into press hacking, but it will be of value, she says, only if&#xa0;it leads to&#xa0;change. She insists she would hate to see legislation that muzzled the press, but she&#xa0;does&#xa0;hope that Leveson's report, due later this year, leads to greater accountability. \"What I&#xa0;don't really understand is people saying this will compromise the freedom of the press. Was the press really free before, with such a small amount of people running it? I didn't think I had any freedom of speech. Lots of people didn't.\"</p> <p>Ultimately, she says, she's one of the lucky ones \u2013 she and her family were savaged but have come through it. Plenty don't. \"It's not about Murdoch. It's about the whole industry. I don't want to have to live that way ever again. And I don't think anybody else should have to live like that.\" \u2022</p> <p><strong>Charlotte Church's EP, One, is released by Alligator Wine Records on 15 October.</strong><br>\u2022 This article was edited on 11 October 2012.

  "<p>These are some of the things we know about the&#xa0;rising star of the Tory party. David Cameron's glittering understudy outshone the future PM at Oxford, where he was elected president of the union. During a distinguished career as a political journalist, he became the unlikely star of a satirical TV show, and continued to write a newspaper column after becoming an MP. Affectionately indulged across the Westminster spectrum, on account of his charm, his personal appeal transcends party loyalty. Contrary to popular opinion, however, his name is not Boris Johnson.</p> <p>\"People keep talking about Boris becoming prime minster,\" reflects an Oxford contemporary. \"But I think it's going to be <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/michaelgove\" title=\"\">Michael Gove</a>.\"</p> <p>If you have never met the secretary of state for&#xa0;education, and do not vote Tory, you may well be of the view that Gove is a nasty little rightwinger with a reactionary vision to return Britain to the 1950s. If so, the description I hear from practically everyone who has ever crossed his path will sound unrecognisable.</p> <p>\"I have only nice things to say about him,\" is&#xa0;the preface I hear time and again. Gove is, Chris&#xa0;Huhne says, \"The politest man in the House of Commons. Incredibly well-mannered. Much more so than people who come from grander backgrounds.\" A senior Labour figure tells me, \"The truth is, he doesn't act like a Tory. He is far&#xa0;too decent. He's in politics for all the right reasons.\" The political columnist <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/matthew-dancona\" title=\"\">Matthew d'Ancona</a> agrees: \"He is just an incredibly nice guy. A lot of people are very nice&#xa0;guys, 'but' \u2013 and with politicians that can have&#xa0;a very big capital B. But he is an absolutely nice guy. He's not a fair-weather friend at all, he's&#xa0;fundamentally loyal, he is a very empathetic character and very solicitous of people's feelings. I'm yet to come away from a&#xa0;gathering where he&#xa0;hasn't charmed everybody in the room. Michael&#xa0;is&#xa0;a very ironic and incredibly good at taking the piss out of himself; he's one of&#xa0;those people you hope will be at dinner.\"</p> <p>From those who knew Gove as a young child, right through to colleagues today, the unanimity of opinion is almost freakish. George Allan was Gove's headmaster throughout secondary school,&#xa0;\"And when I see Michael on the television now, I&#xa0;can still see the 11-year-old boy. He didn't change&#xa0;his persona throughout his school career. Consistency \u2013 that's the word, consistency. We couldn't claim to be the authors of his remarkable civility. He created his own image.\"</p> <p>If Cameron fails to deliver a second term \u2013 and&#xa0;a&#xa0;clear Tory majority in 2015 is looking like a&#xa0;tall order \u2013 there will almost certainly be a new party leader. With the question of succession becoming a very real issue, the education secretary is a very real contender.</p> <p>In August 1967, a baby called Graham was born in Edinburgh to a young unmarried mother, and became Michael Gove four months later, the adopted son of a couple in&#xa0;Aberdeen. A younger sister was adopted five years later, and the Labour-voting family lived in&#xa0;a small ground-floor flat in a tidy if austere grey&#xa0;terrace, until his father's fish-processing business became successful enough for them to&#xa0;move into a three-bedroom semi.</p> <p>Gove attended his local state primary until the age of 11, when he passed the entrance exam to Aberdeen's most prestigious private school for boys. <a href=\"http://www.rgc.aberdeen.sch.uk/\" title=\"\">Robert Gordon's College</a> dominates the city&#xa0;centre, a relatively short distance from Gove's&#xa0;childhood home but a significant cultural leap. Every day the teenage Gove would set off&#xa0;from his little semi with its neat vertical white&#xa0;blinds and symmetrical hanging baskets, to&#xa0;an imposing&#xa0;granite colossus resembling a Soviet-style Eton. But he made the journey with&#xa0;remarkable ease. He rode an ancient bicycle,&#xa0;carried an umbrella, was fond of wearing&#xa0;suits, and quickly established himself as&#xa0;one of the school's most precocious characters.</p> <p>Mike Duncan taught Gove English and debating, and remembers a star debater and \"endlessly enquiring\" boy who enjoyed testing his teacher by reciting the opening line of a novel&#xa0;and challenging Duncan to name the book. Well&#xa0;read and self-consciously clever, Gove and his friends were big fans of sci-fi role-play games such as Wargame, and another called Nuclear War, which involved building up stocks of weapons and occasionally firing them off. A&#xa0;poem&#xa0;penned in his final year, An Essay On Teaching (With Apologies To Alexander Pope), may or may not make teachers smile today, and satirical entries about the senior boys in 1985 suggest he and his friends were already enthusiastic subscribers to Private Eye.</p> <p>\"Michael Gove: His eventual entrance to Oxfam University has finally confirmed his place among mere immortals. He now earns his money tutoring Mr Duncan in English. Naked without his tweeds, it is Colonel Fogey's ambition to be a&#xa0;listed building when he grows up.\" When Gove&#xa0;was invited back a few years later to take part in a debate, posters depicting a&#xa0;caricature of&#xa0;the Ghostbusters' ghost went up all over the school with the strap line: \"Take Govey down at&#xa0;the debate!\"</p> <p>\"Michael was very much a wit,\" one former classmate remembers, \"and a joy to have around. We were never intimates, but he was friendly, intelligent, a nice bloke. He wasn't cool or fashionable, but he was very popular because he would always have a funny rejoinder, and could outwit the teachers. My childhood memories are peppered with laughter because of Michael. One of the things I valued him for was that he prevented me from being bullied. I had glasses and red hair, and I&#xa0;vividly remember being bullied in the changing room, and Michael tried to stop it.\"</p> <p>Gove arrived at Lady Margaret Hall to study English in 1985. The novelist <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/mar/30/philip-hensher-life-in-writing\" title=\"\">Philip Hensher</a> can still recall watching the freshers arrive, and noticing one dressed in a three-piece green tweed&#xa0;suit. \"It was really a young fogey thing. He&#xa0;seemed a little bit older than he was, but not in a ridiculous way. If&#xa0;there was an element of absurdity to him, he always seemed to be in on it,&#xa0;which is a very attractive characteristic.\"</p> <p>Anthony Goodman was president of the&#xa0;Oxford union when Gove arrived. \"He was one of the most gifted speakers I saw in the union. But he didn't generate any antagonism; he was confident, but not in a pushy, aggressive way. He just seemed like an old head on young shoulders.\" Goodman doesn't think Gove was contriving a performance to get in with the elite social set. \"That's pretty much why&#xa0;I did debating,\" he jokes, \"but not Gove. He&#xa0;came across as classless.\"</p> <p>The broadcaster and journalist <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/samira-ahmed\" title=\"\">Samira Ahmed</a> edited the union magazine under Gove's presidency, and sums up the consensus: \"I&#xa0;just&#xa0;didn't see why anyone could loathe him,&#xa0;personally. He was a 40-year-old trapped in&#xa0;a&#xa0;20-year-old's body \u2013 but it was totally sincere. There's nothing fake about him at all. He&#xa0;exuded intelligence, and was very grown up for his age. And thinking big political thoughts, on a scale very few of us at that age were thinking. His vision was fully formed at 20.\" Another contemporary, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/toby-young\" title=\"\">Toby Young</a>, agrees. \"He wasn't a&#xa0;work in progress like the rest of us. He seemed to arrive fully formed.\"</p> <p>Gove encountered his first ever setback after graduation, when a job application to the Conservative Research Department was rejected on the grounds that he was \"insufficiently Conservative\". So he returned to Aberdeen and joined the <a href=\"http://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Press And Journal</a> as a trainee reporter. Within months, the paper went on strike.</p> <p>The father of chapel, Iain Campbell, recalls the staff's initial unease about Gove. \"We knew he was a Tory, and our concern was&#xa0;to have a united front. So we spoke to Michael, and he was happy to come on board. He&#xa0;wasn't a typical striker by any means, but he&#xa0;was very articulate, so we asked Michael to come&#xa0;to the European parliament in Strasbourg to lobby MEPs. He was a very good colleague. Being on strike can be very mentally straining, so we used to have parties to keep morale up, and he was someone who would always be there, and always very popular.\"</p> <p>Gove has subsequently said he thought the strike achieved little, and for how long he would have stuck it out we'll never know, for within three months he was offered a job in television, and soon moved south to work for the political programme <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/otr/\" title=\"\">On The Record</a>, and then the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/default.stm\" title=\"\">Today programme</a>. In 1992 he was hired by Channel 4 to&#xa0;present a late-night political comedy show, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103555/\" title=\"\">A&#xa0;Stab In The Dark</a>, somewhat to the surprise of&#xa0;his co-presenter, <a href=\"http://www.baddiel.com/\" title=\"\">David Baddiel</a>.</p> <p>\"I thought, I've never seen anyone on late-night alternative TV like this. He&#xa0;was rightwing and looked 53. I think he was wearing a three-piece suit. He wasn't cut from the&#xa0;obvious Tory cloth; he is&#xa0;a&#xa0;very bright bloke and a thinking rightwing person, and I'm always&#xa0;interested in intelligent people who think differently from me. I've had many rows with people I've worked with, but not&#xa0;Michael Gove. He was quite humble. He was&#xa0;always very unaggressive. Not trying all the&#xa0;time to intellectually defeat you in that way&#xa0;that politicians can.\"</p> <p>Around the same time Gove appeared as&#xa0;a&#xa0;chaplain in a feature film set in a&#xa0;boarding school. It was a tiny role, but&#xa0;he'd clearly made a big impression on someone along the way, because the lead schoolboy character was given the name M Gove. Neither the film nor A Stab In the Dark were huge hits, though, and in 1996 Gove joined the Times as a columnist and leader writer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397783251\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349283428073/Michael-Gove-on-an-NUJ-pi-008.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Gove on an NUJ picket line in 1989\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In 1989, while a trainee reporter on Aberdeen's Press And Journal, Gove joined an NUJ picket line. Photograph: Donald Stewart</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Donald Stewart</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Newspaper offices are notoriously fractious places, but staff remember an extravagantly congenial, donnish colleague who would soothe reporters late filing copy with, \"But how <em>are</em> you? Yes, of course, should you so wish to file that would be marvellous, that would be very much appreciated. But it's first important that I&#xa0;know how you <em>are</em>.\" Very much the in-house intellectual, the \"most striking thing about him,\" recalls his former editor, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Stothard\" title=\"\">Peter Stothard</a>, \"was that he could make people on the other side of the argument not only recognise his argument, but also genuinely like him.\"</p> <p>Gove became friends with the rising young Tory stars Cameron, George Osborne and Steve Hilton, and co-founded the centre-right think tank <a href=\"http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Policy Exchange</a>. His influence over the party's modernisation project would be difficult to overstate. The exact nature of his contribution, however, is confusing. Everyone tells me his politics owe everything to his humble origins, and are \"all about creating ladders of opportunity; it's all about things you might call progressive, in terms of goals, but using Conservative means\". He is \"ideologically amphibious\", interested in ideas from the left, \"on a moral mission, to do with helping the poorest\", and responsible for helping to coax his party into the 21st century. Even his political opponents concur. According to a senior Labour party official, \"On sexuality and class and social mobility, on race and gender, he is&#xa0;a genuine liberal.\" He is not, Huhne agrees, \"a&#xa0;traditional rightwinger.\"</p> <p>Then I read every word published under his Times byline up to his election in 2005, and found&#xa0;that Gove the progressive arch-moderniser simply does not fit with the facts. If you want to understand what Tory modernisation really adds up to, it's a highly instructive read.</p> <p>Gove's neo-con hawkishness in foreign policy has always been well known. He called for the invasion of Iraq just two days after 9/11, and before the planes hit the towers he'd already published a column that morning calling for action against Saddam Hussein. A committed Zionist and slavish admirer of George W Bush, a&#xa0;passionate Eurosceptic and staunch defender of&#xa0;British Gibraltar, he regards the Northern Ireland peace process as a shameful capitulation to terrorists, and once wrote a column calling for&#xa0;\"a revival of jingoism\". But where is the evidence in his writing of domestic social liberalism? It doesn't exist.</p> <p>Passionately pro marriage, he opposes statutory paternity pay, stem cell research, euthanasia and contraception for school children, but supports privatisation of both the BBC and the NHS, and proposes the marketisation of immigration policy,&#xa0;whereby a British passport could, he suggests, be sold for \u00a310,000. He is far ruder about the Lib Dems than New Labour, despairs of the \"absurd belief\" that the armed forces ought to reflect the country they serve by recruiting more women and gay men, and takes a&#xa0;robustly bang-em-up approach to law and order. As for supporting public services, Gove can see only one acceptable line: \"The Conservatives could defend public servants from the unjust, unproven and demoralising charge of 'institutional racism',\" the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/1999/feb/24/lawrence.ukcrime12\" title=\"\">Macpherson report</a> being, in his view, an outrage.</p> <p>Why, then, do so many colleagues and political opponents see Gove in this rosier, more moderate light? It has to be because of his debater's gift for according courteous respect to opposing views, creating the impression that he's taken them on board, when he hasn't actually revised his position at all. Everyone tells me how carefully Gove listens, but when asked to recall a single occasion when he has been persuaded to change his mind, to their surprise no one can come up with one. It is a case of manners maketh the impression of a moderniser, for Gove's Tories don't need to be \"inclusive\", or \"tolerant\". The&#xa0;important thing is to look as if they are.</p> <p>He warns the party against \"Social Tone Deafness\", which \"manifests itself in an inability to detect the country's changing mood music\", and calls for candidates who \"look like human beings who understand the daily struggles of modern existence\". But a 2003 column tellingly reveals where Gove ranks the importance of actual policy reform: \"The Tories have not yet adopted a tone, style, culture <em>or even</em> [my italics] a set of policy priorities appropriate for the 21st century.\" A Tory minister and friend of Gove's probably comes closest to the truth when he characterises him as a \"true Conservative, the rightwing conscience of the cabinet. He is a full spectrum, real world Tory; it's all about living in the real world. He would regard the Tory rightwing as completely unrealistic\" \u2013 which is not the&#xa0;same as wrong. Labour MPs like to say Cameron's Conservatives have modernised on only one solitary issue \u2013 homophobia \u2013 and I&#xa0;used to think that had to be&#xa0;too cynical. But in all of Gove's writing it's the only example of an authentically abandoned prejudice.</p> <p>What of Gove's famous passion for social mobility through education? \"His view on social mobility is for people to do what he did \u2013 study classical subjects and go to Oxford,\" argues a Labour critic. \"It's all slightly 'Some working-class people are terribly good at Latin \u2013 give them a chance and you never know!'\" The former Labour schools minister Jim Knight agrees. \"If he thinks social mobility is getting more poor kids into Oxbridge, then I think that's a massively flawed definition. If you are serious about social mobility, it has to be communities and families, not just individuals.\"</p> <p>Interestingly, in 2000 Gove wrote, \"Too many people go to university\", but his columns reveal surprisingly little about the future secretary of state's thoughts on education. For their origins, we need to go back further still, to his old school days. \"He benefited in a life-changing way from a&#xa0;classical liberal education,\" as a close ally puts it, \"and would like that privilege to be extended to people from less privileged backgrounds.\"</p> <p>For all its architectural grandeur, Robert Gordon's College during Gove's era was actually Scotland's second cheapest private day school \u2013 \"more of a glorified grammar, really,\" as a former pupil puts it. About half the boys joined from state primaries, and a quarter received a bursary or scholarship. George Allan and Mike Duncan both assumed Gove had been a scholarship boy, but in fact it was only when his father's business failed in his final year that the family applied for assistance. But every boy had to pass the entrance exam, and the school could operate on the assumption that all pupils would be not merely able, but disposed to work hard.</p> <p>\"When you enter Gordon's and start wearing the blazer and tie, you sort of absorb the traditions of the college,\" a former teacher tells me. \"Those kids from poorer economic backgrounds tried to climb upwards, not pull the others down.\" When&#xa0;I&#xa0;ask Allan what sort of disciplinary problems he used to deal with, he looks surprised. \"Well, if I&#xa0;had one a term, that was enough for me.\" The current acting head says the worst he's encountered was a boy kicking about a plastic bottle who ignored his request to put it in the bin.</p> <p>Gove has always spoken highly of his old school, and when I visit I can see why. But while I'm admiring its orderly classrooms and general air of cheerful application, a teacher puts into words what I find myself thinking. \"The trouble with anyone's own experience of school,\" the teacher points out, \"is that it's so formative that it informs all your ideas about education. That's very natural, but not necessarily a good thing.\"</p> <p>From the age of 11, Gove never shared a desk with anyone who struggled to read and write, or who experienced school as&#xa0;an intimidating trauma instead of a golden ticket. \"His prime concern is to make sure&#xa0;that there are safe schools in cities for people&#xa0;like him,\" says a columnist who has followed his career closely. \"All this nonsense that&#xa0;free schools are free \u2013 they are not, they are Michael Gove schools. He is trying to create a system in which middle-class parents like him can make uses of the state system without having&#xa0;to mix with the rough boys.\"</p> <p>Following his election in 2005, Gove wrote, \"The&#xa0;reason why I'm in Parliament is not really to see my colleagues win power, it is to see us at last in a position where we can give it up.\"</p> <p>But since taking office, he has awarded himself more than 50&#xa0;new powers, including rules allowing him to acquire land from local authorities and private companies to help him increase the number of academies and free schools. This autumn 55 new free schools will open, taking the total to 80, and the number of academies has risen tenfold to more than 2,300, each one accountable not to local authorities, but to the secretary of state himself. \"He is a High Tory control freak who wants to run every school in the country,\" counters the critic of Gove's \"free\" school rhetoric. \"He hasn't got a localist bone in his body.\"</p> <p>There are other curious paradoxes. A friend for more than 20 years has never once heard him mention money, and says he regards it with unworldly indifference. But in 2002 Gove wrote about living perennially beyond his means \u2013 \"Ever since going up to university, I&#xa0;have accumulated new debt, and new means of becoming indebted\". And when the expenses scandal broke, it emerged that he'd spent \u00a37,000 of taxpayers' money on designer furniture, much of it from Cameron's mother-in-law's interior design company.</p> <p>Another puzzle was his use of private email addresses to communicate with his team. Everyone says Gove has a practically courtly deference to protocol, but he was plainly breaking the rules. Gove pleaded an innocent failure to master his own departmental technology, and his physical ineptitude is legendary; being driven by Gove is, apparently, a \"terrifying\" experience. Whether techno-klutziness explains an arrangement that conveniently kept secrets from hostile civil servants, however, is unclear.</p> <p>For a man known to be meticulously conscientious, Gove's ministerial career got off to an oddly bumpy start. In the early months, he drew criticism for awarding a grant to a Jewish schools security trust on whose advisory body he had sat [see footnote], and then there was the botched cancellation of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_Schools_for_the_Future\" title=\"\">Building Schools For The Future</a> programme, and confusion over the number of schools wishing to become academies. Gove blamed sabotage by his own department \u2013 in a colleague's words, a \"ministerial blooding\". But last year he hired a special adviser who'd been previously blackballed by Andy Coulson, called Dominic Cummings. \"And you could almost feel,\" says a senior aide, \"that the moment Dom came to join him, things started getting back on track.\"</p> <p>Earlier this year, Gove leaked to the Daily Mail his plan to restore O-Levels, sidestepping departmental and Lib Dem opposition to court the rightwing press, whose praise was predictably rapturous. Issuing every school in the country with a leather-bound King James bible inscribed with the words, \"Presented by the secretary of state for education\" surely did more for Gove's profile than&#xa0;for the nation's spiritual improvement. At \u00a3370,000, it was a pricey gesture, but private donors comprised almost exclusively of rightwing Christian financiers were happy to foot the whole bill. Gove's other big idea this year was pricier still \u2013 a new \u00a360m royal yacht for the Queen as a diamond jubilee present. It was clearly never going to happen, but sent another signal to the right, as did his audacious hymn at the Leveson enquiry to the virtues of \"one of the most impressive and significant figures of the last 50 years\", Rupert Murdoch. \"Cummings is a really amazingly effective political street fighter,\" the aide says, \"the wily operator he needed. Since then, Michael has felt a new sense of confidence.\"</p> <p>Gove's confidence extends well beyond his existing role. Most cabinet ministers haven't the energy or political courage to discuss their colleagues' policies in any detail; Gove isn't one of them. \"Michael does have an opinion on everything,\" says <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/timmontgomerie\" title=\"\">Tim Montgomerie</a>, editor of <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/\" title=\"\">Conservative Home</a>, \"and he talks in cabinet a lot.\" One cabinet minister describes him as \"being slightly inclined to go off on a bit of a rant off his own brief\", and an aide describes his role as the \"energetic challenger \u2013 especially of the system, and of conventional wisdom\". And yet, says another minister firmly, \"I can't think of anyone who sees him as a political rival.\"</p> <p>How could Gove possibly not be seen as a political rival? He may be Osborne's closest ally, but in the opinion of one Lib Dem minister is \"substantially cleverer\". He is Cameron's \"closest&#xa0;friend in politics\", helping him prepare for PMQs, feeding jokes into his speeches, and he&#xa0;\"can be quite dazzlingly funny, brilliant at doing impressions\", a friend reports. \"I've heard him do what must be a set piece, in which he does a great impression of Huhne condescending to Clegg in cabinet, that had the whole table in stitches. Genuinely funny satire.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397783252\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349282180167/Michael-Gove-on-a-New-Yea-008.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Gove on a New Year's Day walk in 2011 with the Cameron family and friends \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On a New Year's Day walk in 2011 with the Cameron family and friends, including Tim Burton and Helena Bonham Carter.

They&#xa0;are in and out of each other's houses, kids and nannies everywhere, they are each others' kids' godparents, their kids go to the same schools. The question of succession doesn't cross their minds.\"</p> <p>The question is whether it crosses Gove's.</p> <p>Just how far does Gove's ambition go? \"At&#xa0;Oxford it was obvious that some people were warming up for the Commons,\" Samira Ahmed recalls. \"With&#xa0;Boris Johnson, his plan was obvious. But I&#xa0;never heard that said about Michael.\" Former colleagues at the Times assumed for a&#xa0;while that he would become their editor, \"But he wasn't seen as someone angling for his own personal promotion at all.\" Gove has always insisted he has no interest in leading his party, saying, \"I&#xa0;don't have it in me. I don't have what it takes.\" And yet, as Matthew d'Ancona observes, \"You can&#xa0;never assume that a politician who has devoted his life to the game will walk away from the chance to be leader or PM. It's ridiculous for us to think that any politician might.\"</p> <p>A lot of very wealthy Tories presumably agree, for Gove's constituency office last year received five times the party's national average sum of donations. Individual and corporate donors gave&#xa0;Gove, who occupies one of the safest seats in the country, more than \u00a360,000 \u2013 almost twice the sum received by Osborne's office and three times more than Cameron's. What exactly are they funding?</p> <p>Nobody believes Gove would ever challenge Cameron for the leadership. And Gove had always&#xa0;assumed that, when the succession did come, the heir would be Osborne. But now that&#xa0;the chancellor is becoming unelectably damaged goods, and talk of a Johnson leadership bid gathers momentum, few think Gove would simply stand by and watch London's mayor move&#xa0;into Downing Street. If the party needs a&#xa0;Stop Boris candidate, it will be Gove.</p> <p>Does he have what it takes? Former colleagues are unsure. \"He is an intellectual, not a man of&#xa0;the&#xa0;people, and whether he could operate in&#xa0;an&#xa0;environment in which not very many people knew who <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiro_Agnew\" title=\"\">Spiro Agnew</a> was I don't know.\"&#xa0;I ask his old boss, and Stothard chuckles. \"I think by common consent the job of home news editor wasn't his natural home. News editors, unless they're hated half the time, are not&#xa0;really on top of their job. Was Michael able to&#xa0;do the throwing the typewriter thing? No. He&#xa0;didn't have the temperament for that role. I&#xa0;don't really believe in pop psychology, so I'm reluctant to go into this very far, but he is quite thin-skinned. Perhaps too sensitive to be home news editor \u2013 or prime minister.\"</p> <p>Someone else who knows Gove well agrees that at first he tended to flap when things didn't&#xa0;go smoothly. \"This 'I haven't got what it takes' line, I think what he was referring to was this thing of coping with the ups and downs and the crap you get. The relentless roller-coaster and inevitable failures. He previously might have been a bit insecure about his ability to cope&#xa0;with adversity, but I think that has gone now. I think that has changed. If you'd asked me&#xa0;18 months ago, do you think he could and should aim to be PM one day, I would have said&#xa0;no. But now I think Michael could.\" There's&#xa0;some speculation that the decision will ultimately fall to his wife, the Times columnist <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/tag/sarah-vine\" title=\"\">Sarah Vine</a>, but no agreement on which way she'll go.</p> <p>\"I think she adores being a Tory wife,\" says one friend. \"The more pictures she can be in with Sam Cam, the better her life becomes.\" But another disagrees. \"I've heard people say that, but I don't think she's a scheming Machiavellian political wife, pushing her husband's career.\" She has a funny way of going about it if she is, featuring marital anecdotes in her column that render him a faintly absurd eccentric.</p> <p>The couple met at the Times, married in 2001, and live with their daughter and son, nine and seven, in a modest terraced house at the Wormwood Scrubs end of North Kensington, where dinner is \"a standard middle-class set up; completely informal, non matching furniture, child-centred, you can't move for books, the kids are usually up. Sarah does most of the cooking \u2013 meat and two veg or pasta, no bought in food or waitresses or any of that nonsense \u2013 and Michael's pouring the wine. It's jolly and cosy and warm and about having fun.\"</p> <p>And if Vine's wider family wind up as Downing Street in-laws, then by all accounts they should provide fabulous entertainment. \"A totally mad, bonkers, crazy family,\" a friend laughs. \"They're around in&#xa0;Michael's life in a soap opera sort of way, fodder for amazing stories and anecdotes and hassle and problems.\"</p> <p>Gove's relationship with his parents has always&#xa0;been \"very tender and loving\", another friend says. \"That said, I don't want to sound crude or pompous, but he has a metropolitan London life. There is a gap there.\"</p> <p>But Gove has never looked for his birth mother, and says he never will, out of loyalty to the parents who raised him. \"He is just not a very conflicted person,\" another friend offers simply. \"I don't think there's a great deal of inner turmoil there. He regards life as having smiled on him.\"</p> <p>Gove has always been good-humoured about his place in the party's popularity stakes. In fact, he's so accustomed to coming second as the party faithful's choice of after-dinner speaker, he likes to joke that on his gravestone will be carved the words: \"They Couldn't Get Boris.\" But though Johnson's sense of humour has got him a long way so far, few would bet on him having the last laugh. \"If you had told me Boris Johnson was going to be mayor of London,\" reflects Anthony Goodman, their fellow ex-Oxford union president, \"I definitely would have laughed at you. If you had told me Michael Gove was going to be in government, I would have thought that was pretty obvious.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This footnote was added on 15 October 2012.

  "<p>No writer is better placed than Chinua Achebe to tell the story of the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/596712.stm\" title=\"\">Nigerian Biafran war </a>from a cultural and political perspective. Yet, apart from an interview with Transition magazine in 1968 and a book of Biafran poems, Nigeria's most eminent novelist has kept a literary silence about the civil war in which he played a prominent role \u2013 until now. In his engrossing new memoir, <em>There Was A Country</em>, Achebe, now 81, finally speaks about his life during the conflict that nearly tore Nigeria apart in the late 60s.</p> <p>In many ways, the early part of Achebe's life mirrors the story of early Nigeria. Nicknamed \"Dictionary\", Achebe was a gifted Igbo student and enthusiastic reader, a member of the \"Lucky Generation\" of young students who rubbed shoulders at top institutions under the tutelage of Oxbridge colonials. They were effortlessly absorbed into the media, industry and civil service, serving a Nigeria driven by optimism on its way to freedom from British rule.</p> <p>By independence in 1960, Igbo people dominated commerce and the public sector in a land where the three biggest ethnic groups (the Yoruba, Hausa and Igbo) were jostling for supremacy. Achebe attributes Igbo domination to their self-confidence, inherent democratic values and adaptability, which were suited to Nigeria's modernising economy. But many Nigerians resented it, and Achebe admits that the Igbo could be cocky, brash and materialistic, though he rejects the popular suspicion that there was a pan-Igbo agenda to control Nigeria \u2013 his people have too strong an \"individualistic ethic\".</p> <p>Six years after independence, corruption and electoral rigging preceded a military coup that overthrew Nigeria's first prime minister, the Muslim northerner, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abubakar_Tafawa_Balewa\" title=\"\">Abubakar Tafawa Balewa</a>. Although most of the coup-plotters were Igbo, Achebe disputes that it was an \"Igbo\" coup, partly on the basis that its leader,<a href=\"http://www.dawodu.com/nzeogwu2.htm\" title=\"\"> Major Nzeogwu</a>, had grown up in the north and was Igbo in name only. Nevertheless, the murder of Nigeria's northern leaders led to pogroms in which 30,000 Igbos living in the north were killed. The bloodshed culminated in<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/27/chukwuemeka-odumegwu-ojukwu\" title=\"\"> General Emeka Ojukwu</a>'s declaration in 1967 that the Igbos' south-eastern region would secede from a country in which his people \"felt unwanted\".</p> <p>Fearing the disintegration of Nigeria, the government blocked the secession with military force, backed by a UK government keen to protect its oil interests. Profoundly disappointed by this turn of events, Achebe left his job at the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation in Lagos and returned with his family to the south-east, now calling itself the Republic of Biafra. The Nigerian army launched a three-pronged attack to subdue the Biafrans, who fought back assiduously despite being out-resourced. Achebe describes a wartime spirit that inspired Biafran engineers to build army tanks out of reinforced Range Rovers and to invent the infamous <a href=\"http://www.nairaland.com/618174/wonders-biafran-war-tech-ogbunigwe\" title=\"\"><em>ogbunigwe</em></a> (bucket bomb) with devastating effect. Though he abhors violence, Achebe cites these as evidence of the quality of the Nigerian people, and he laments the corruption that strangled such ingenuity.</p> <p>In the middle chapters, memoir gives way to largely neutral historical analysis, with Achebe citing a range of voices, media reports and books. There are interesting insights into the war's two central players: Biafra's leader Ojukwu and Nigerian president, <a href=\"http://www.onlinenigeria.com/gowon.asp\" title=\"\">General Yakubu Gowon</a>, both Sandhurst-trained young men. Rivalries between them and within their teams \"confounded political science models\". Possessing little administrative experience, the two men pursued ego-driven policies, and missed opportunities to end the conflict sooner. Achebe cites Biafran diplomat Raph Uwechue, who accused Ojukwu of choosing ideology over pragmatism when he rejected relief supplies from the British.</p> <p>In the following chapters, Achebe's personal story re-emerges. Despite the war, he lived a remarkably productive life. Driven by his belief in the political obligations of the writer, he became Biafra's international envoy, promoting the cause in Canada, Europe and Senegal. He set up a publishing company with his close friend Chris Okigbo, and became Biafra's communications minister, writing a manifesto for the republic. He describes being part of an intellectual elite that came together to recreate a Biafran microcosm of Nigeria's early spirit, their ideals drawn from a mix of traditional Igbo philosophy, US-style liberalism and socialism.</p> <p>As the federal army closed in, Achebe and his family moved from town to town before settling in his father's village. The atrocities proved inescapable: at a market, Achebe's wife Christie saw a bomb split a pregnant woman in two. Achebe relays such horrors \u2013 including the deaths of his mother and friend Okigbo \u2013 with stoic brevity; his strongest expressions of sorrow are his poems, such as the famous <a href=\"http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~lavie/dreamwine/achebe1.html\" title=\"\">\"Refugee Mother and Child\"</a>. Reproduced from his 1971 Biafran poetry book <em>Beware, Soul Brother</em>, these verses are scattered between chapters, offering affecting interludes.</p> <p>As the conflict dragged on, Biafra buckled under a blockade so brutal it provoked an international outcry: mass starvation, kwashiorkor and mental illness devastated the Igbo landscape, where vultures, those \"avian prognosticators of death\", circled overhead. Biafra was the world's first properly televised conflict, and millions across the world were appalled by the horrors flickering on their screens. Such people as Joan Baez, John Lennon, Martin Luther King and Karl Vonnegut galvanised international responses to the tragedy, in an age before \"Africa fatigue\" had set in.</p> <p>By the time hostilities ended in 1970, three million Biafrans had died, in contrast to 100,000 casualties on the federal side. Igbos weren't mere casualties of war, Achebe insists, but victims of calculated genocide. Ojukwu, meanwhile, escaped to live in exile in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, inviting accusations of cowardice. Achebe rationalises this move on the basis that if the Biafran leader had stayed in Nigeria, Gowon would have been less magnanimous and conciliatory towards Igbos after the war.</p> <p>Igbos were reintegrated into Nigerian society, but still faced economic discrimination. Achebe offers an excerpt of an interview in which Gowon tries to justify the crippling \u00a320 flat fee given to every Biafran wanting to convert their Biafran currency back to the Nigerian naira. This sense of persecution still persists today: Achebe believes that Igbo people are the engine of Nigeria's advancement, stifled by a corrupt elite that prefers power and mediocrity to meritocracy. Igbo ostracisation, he says, is \"one of the main reasons for the country's continued backwardness\". Some might call this supremacism, but Achebe is ultimately a Nigerian patriot who sympathises with ordinary Igbos, rather than any broad Igbo power structure.</p> <p>The final chapter is an exhortation to better governance, in which he examines corruption, ethnic bigotry, state failure and the steps Nigeria must take to rehabilitate itself. This prescriptive wish list reminds us of the gap between theory and practice in Nigerian politics; it makes you pine for the likes of Achebe to govern. But sadly, he's not writing a manifesto; instead, we have in <em>There Was A Country</em> an elegy from a&#xa0;master storyteller who has witnessed the undulating fortunes of a nation, which \u2013 unlike young \"Dictionary\" \u2013 has yet to fulfil its potential.</p> <p>\u2022 Noo Saro-Wiwa's <em>Looking for Transwonderland: Travels in Nigeria</em> is published by Granta.</p>",
  "<p>\"Act like a penguin and you will be accepted as a penguin,\" Frank Todd, our expedition ornithologist, briefed us as we buckled our life jackets and prepared to go ashore.</p> <p>Dropping anchor in South Georgia's Bay of Isles, we filed off the gangway into eight-man Zodiac boats. Mine was the first to fill and we sped away with the engine revving loudly, leaving a swell of icy water in our wake.</p> <p>Crisp air filled our lungs as we bounced across the chop towards Salisbury Plain \u2013 a bay which, except for the broad valley sweeping through it, bears little resemblance to its English namesake.</p> <p>As we raced towards the shore, it came alive with frantic fur seals that lurched in the shallows, splashed in the surf and wriggled up the beach behind. We were heading for a fur seal holiday camp and, with zoom lenses already extended, there was a flurry of camera clicks from the boat.</p> <p>Having left port in Argentina, I'd spent the past week-and-a-half rocking and rolling across the Scotia Sea with 100 other passengers on board the 340ft M/S Expedition.</p> <p>For most passengers \u2013 an assortment of Canadians, British and Antipodeans, aged 16 to more than 60 \u2013 the real appeal of this expedition was the white continent. Seduced by the mouthwash-blue glaciers and petrified seas of the BBC's Frozen Planet documentaries, we were a party eager for ice. But, with our 18-day cruise heading to the Falkland Islands and South Georgia first, we'd have to wait until day 16 to set foot on Antarctica.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397389093\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2012/10/4/1349360620872/Lucy-Grewcock-makes-new-f-008.jpg\" alt=\"Lucy Grewcock makes new friends in South Gerogia\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lucy makes new friends in South Georgia</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>No nature programme could ever have prepared us for the experiences that lay ahead: as we cruised ever closer to the end of the earth, the gin-clear waters our ship was sailing in would become choked with ice, like an ocean of melting mojitos. At times, the surface of the sea would appear to freeze over entirely, slowing our progress to walking pace, as the bow of our ship pushed at the pack ice until it fissured enough to let us through.</p> <p>We would see icebergs five times the size of our ship, pocked with sun spots and fractured with wound-like crevices that glowed sapphire-blue inside. Weddell seals with frosted lashes, contorted coastlines encased in ice sculptures, research stations with no running water, and washed-up whale bones the size of fallen trees \u2026 all this, and more, awaited us in Antarctica.</p> <p>\"You may as well see it all though, if you're coming this far south,\" was a phrase that regularly got batted around at meal times, when guests justified booking this multi-stop tour rather than the \"Antarctica-only\" option.</p> <p>But the Falkland Islands had been much more than a filler. We'd seen giant albatrosses feed chicks the size of terriers, watched spouting whales, and walked barefoot across white sand beaches. And now, after three full days at sea, South Georgia already seemed set to exceed expectations.</p> <p>As we entered the shallows, the engines of the boat were cut and the air filled with the purrs and grrrrs, snivels and sneezes of seal pups \u2013 a constant murmur beneath the barks and snorts of their parents, who lolloped along the water's edge.</p> <p>Swinging our wellie-booted feet on to the beach, we heaved the Zodiacs ashore as a squad of seals shuffled over on their fore flippers and cautioned us with low growls and sharp yellow canines.</p> <p>As I waggled a trekking pole in defence, a party of well-dressed penguins paraded through a swarm of seal pups and waddled down the beach to welcome us. One particularly smart adult stepped forward and casually waved a wing at the scene behind him.</p> <p>As I followed his gesture, my jaw began to drop \u2013 and kept dropping.</p> <p>King penguins adorned the dunes in their thousands, packed out the plain beyond, and sprawled up the hillside until their silvery silhouettes merged into the horizon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397389094\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2012/10/4/1349360862895/more-than-10000-penguins--008.jpg\" alt=\"more than 100,00 penguins on Salisbury Plain, South Gerogia\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There were more than 100,00 penguins on Salisbury Plain, South Georgia</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucy Grewcock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We had arrived at one of the biggest penguin parties on the planet. More than 100,000 of them populated the scene, and were bathed in a pool of golden light that radiated across the rookery like a warm glow. But searching the sky for a break in the clouds, I saw nothing but a solid mass of grey mist over the bay \u2013 a typical South Georgian sky.</p> <p>\"I think they look better in poor light,\" Frank commented from behind me. \"They really shine, don't they?\"</p> <p>I nodded in agreement, suddenly realising it was their yellow-tinged chins that were giving off the glow.</p> <p>Mesmerised, I picked my way across the pebble beach towards the colony, taking care not to squash the seal pups that fidgeted about my feet and doing my best to avoid their pugnacious parents.</p> <p>As pups gave way to penguins, growls and purrs turned to twitters and trumpet calls, and the musky odour of seal fur was replaced by the fusty smell of feathers.</p> <p>Like a busy market, the colony was in a constant state of murmur and mutter. Every few minutes, the hubbub was cut through by groups of adults who would stretch their throats skywards, raise their beaks above the throng, and give a chorus of trumpet calls that echoed across the plain.</p> <p>Their calls were answered by the squeak and whistle of indignant chicks, who sat in thick, fur coats, awaiting their next feed of fish. These infants take more than 14 months to go from fur ball to fully watertight and, until then, are beach-bound and at the mercy of the petrels and skuas, circling above.</p> <p>Distancing themselves from their squeaking siblings, adolescents waddled around the rookery in various stages of moult, the remains of their baby fluff clinging to their lower bellies in pubescent fashion or adorning their crowns with unfashionable crops.</p> <p>In contrast, their parents stood in perfect penguin plumage, their tuxedo coats acting as natural wetsuits, and each appeared to be wearing a set of carrot-coloured earmuffs over a velvet-black hood \u2013 handsome markings which seemed to afford them inner confidence.</p> <p>Seeing the next boat of tourists arrive on the beach, I set off to find a quiet spot to take it all in. But as I clambered across the dunes, I had the feeling I was being followed and turned to find I had a penguin in tow. Up to my waist in height, he wobbled along with his head down, webbed black feet slipping across the stones.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397389095\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2012/10/4/1349360960918/The-MS-Expedition-anchore-001.jpg\" alt=\"The MS Expedition anchored off South Gerogia\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The M/S Expedition anchored off South Georgia</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucy Grewcock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\"They are prone to being groupies,\" Frank had warned us during our briefing. South Georgia's penguins have little reason to fear us. The only humans to settle on the island were the whalers, who came and went in the 1900s, and had little interest in penguin meat. Apart from the odd explorer, penguins have never been hunted by man, and their only visitors these days are groups of tourists and a scattering of scientists. Consequently, it appears, fear has been replaced with fascination.</p> <p>Finding a vacant mound of tussock grass, I sat down and let out a contented sigh.

  "<p>David Cameron has failed to end the Tories' image as the party of the rich and is paying the price as Conservatives struggle to extend their appeal to urban areas in the north of England, according to the head of Downing Street's favourite thinktank.</p> <p>In a searing critique of the prime minister's faltering modernisation project, the director of Policy Exchange, Neil O'Brien, calls for an urgent round of renewal in the light of Cameron's failure to heal the \"party's worst wounds\".</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/05/conservatives-new-workers-party\" title=\"\">Writing for the Guardian on the eve of the Conservative conference</a> in Birmingham, O'Brien says: \"The Tories urgently need a new round of renewal. Tory modernisation has not yet healed the party's worst wounds. It is still seen as the party of the rich. It does badly in urban areas, particularly outside the south-east.\"</p> <p>The intervention by O'Brien, whose thinktank has been an intellectual powerhouse for so-called \"Cameroons\", reflects the concerns among many modernisers that the project to detoxify the image of the Tories has stalled. It was designed to show that the Tories, who were famously described in 2002 by Theresa May, now the home secretary, as the \"nasty party\", reflected modern, diverse Britain. Cameron famously broke with the past, and highlighted his green credentials, by posing with huskies on a visit to Svalbard in the Norwegian Arctic in 2006.</p> <p>On Friday, in another blow for the government, Europe's environment chief highlighted concerns in the EU that the coalition is failing to live up to its pledge to become Britain's greenest ever government by accusing critics of environmental regulations of making \"untrue\" claims.</p> <p>Janez Potocnik, the European environment commissioner, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/05/tories-warned-eu-green-agenda\" title=\"\">told the Guardian</a> that for politicians to suggest that environmental legislation was a burden was \"very unhelpful, because it is untrue\".</p> <p>The commissioner did not name any Tory ministers. But chancellor George Osborne has criticised green regulations.</p> <p>Separately, in a Guardian interview before the Conservative conference, the new culture secretary, Maria Miller, claimed the government was acting in a progressive way as it lifts 2 million of the lowest earners out of tax.</p> <p>Miller, who is also minister for women and equalities, said: \"When you look at what we have been doing for the last two and a half years, so much of it does resonate with women. If you look at what we have done in terms of focusing on cutting the deficit, welfare reform and tax reforms \u2013 lifting 2 million of the lowest paid people out of tax altogether disproportionately supports women who can often have part-time jobs.\"</p> <p>Miller declined to join the campaign to end the Sun's Page 3 girl, saying: \"It is for newspapers to decide what they print and it is for consumers to decide what they buy. That is the way it should be, and I don't think it is right for ministers to dictate what goes on any page of a newspaper, whether it is page 3 or not.\"</p> <p>In his Guardian article, O'Brien calls for \"blue collar modernisation\" focused on the north and the Midlands which would see the end of middle-class benefits. \"What about middle-class benefits?\" he asks. \"Do we really need to give child benefit to households that are better off than average? Post-election we should stop giving free TV licences, winter fuel payments and bus passes to millionaires.\"</p> <p>O'Brien says the prime minister must resist calls from the Tory right, notably the new Conservative Voice group, to champion a more traditional agenda.</p> <p>\"Obviously Cameron should ignore calls from the usual suspects to lurch rightward. But the solution isn't as simple as tacking to the centre. After all, most voters have tough views on crime, welfare and immigration. What's needed is a blue-collar modernisation, focused on the north and Midlands.\"</p> <p>Amid continuing concerns about the failure of the Tory party to appeal to British minority ethnic communities, O'Brien calls on the prime minister to renounce the so called \"cricket test\" set by Lord Tebbit. The former Tory chairman famously said in 1990 that members of minority communities could not be considered fully British if they supported the cricket team of their country of ancestry rather than England.</p> <p>\"Supporting Pakistan or the Windies at cricket is no more evidence that someone has failed to integrate than wearing a kilt to a wedding is proof of Jacobite sympathies. You can be intensely British, but want to hold on to your family history.\"</p> <p>The prime minister will on Saturday try to draw a line under one issue that harmed the Tory brand \u2013 Andrew Lansley's health reforms \u2013 when he unveils a \u00a3140m fund to help reduce paperwork.</p> <p>In a visit to a hospital, Cameron will announce that \u00a3100m will be invested in new software to cut form filling and \u00a340m to train 10,000 nurses and midwives for greater leadership roles in the NHS.</p> <p>In marked contrast with Lansley, who found himself at odds with most professional medical bodies, the new health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, will say: \"The importance of these issues was laid bare by doctors' and nursing leaders this week. The government's role is to listen to the NHS and support these leaders \u2013 that's what we're doing today.\"</p>",
  "<p>In 2005 when David Cameron was elected leader, the Conservatives had been on the ropes for more than a decade. His modernisation programme did enough to make him prime minister, but only in coalition. The Tories gained the most seats since 1931, but started from a place where too many voters thought the party was \"not for them\".</p> <p>It's easy to forget how much Cameron has changed his party. Would previous leaders have backed gay marriage, introduced a bank levy, increased capital gains tax, carved low-wage workers out of the public-sector pay freeze, or introduced a&#xa0;pupil premium for poorer children?</p> <p>Yet today the Tories urgently need a new round of renewal. While progress has been made, Tory modernisation has not healed the party's worst wounds. It is still seen as the party of the rich. It does badly in urban areas, particularly outside the south-east. And that's partly because it does so badly among Britain's biggest ethnic minorities.</p> <p>Obviously Cameron should ignore calls from the usual suspects to lurch rightward. But the solution isn't as simple as tacking to the centre \u2013 after all, most voters have tough views on crime, welfare and immigration. What's needed is a blue-collar modernisation, focused on the north and Midlands.</p> <p>Voters are a lot more cynical than they were in 1997. Inheriting the biggest deficit since the second world war means that Tory modernisers can't easily demonstrate change by promising big increases in public spending. While Labour's lead is smaller than you might expect given the mega deficit, the Tories need to be about 9% ahead of Labour in the polls to win a majority. They have been averaging about 10% behind. So with no change of direction there's no chance of a majority.</p> <p>In 2010 Cameron managed to get more ethnic minority MPs elected. There is no magic policy bullet that will get the party more ethnic minority votes \u2013 non-white voters aren't a homogenous group, and don't want to be pigeonholed. But <a href=\"http://lordashcroftpolls.com/category/ethnic-minority-voters/\" title=\"\">polling for Lord Ashcroft</a> suggests some minority voters are put off by the party's historic baggage. As a small start the prime minister should explicitly renounce <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_test\" title=\"\">Norman Tebbit's \"cricket test\"</a>. Supporting Pakistan or the Windies at cricket is no more evidence that someone has failed to integrate than wearing a kilt to a wedding is proof of Jacobite sympathies. You can be intensely British, but want to hold on to your family history.</p> <p>Polls show the answer to the \"party of the rich\" label is not to whack the rich but to focus ruthlessly on driving down unemployment, helping people earn more, and cutting the cost of living.</p> <p>Further welfare reform is an important part of the answer. But so is more help. Because chronic worklessness in Britain first became established during the Thatcher years, the Tories have a special responsibility to fix Britain's unemployment blackspots. Cameron should launch a war on unemployment. That could involve increasing working tax credits, to better reward those who work hard on low incomes. It could mean cutting employers' national insurance contributions for people on low wages. In the most run-down towns it could involve breaking with free-market orthodoxy and backing government job creation.</p> <p>How to pay for all this? The most popular source of funds would be to cancel the planned increase in foreign aid spending. The prime minister won't do that, of course; and while I don't agree, I respect his reasons for sticking with it. What about middle class benefits? Do we really need to give child benefit to households that are better off than average? We could redirect funds from other benefits that discourage work, and post-election we should stop giving free TV licences, winter fuel payments and bus passes to millionaires. People are worried about the cost of living. The government should get tough on privatised utilities such as water, energy and the railways, to squeeze down costs.</p> <p>Last but not least, Cameron should take some Swedish lessons. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/feb/09/david-cameron-nordic-goliaths-sweden\" title=\"\">Fredrik Reinfeldt, the Swedish PM, is a fellow conservative moderniser</a>, and in 2010 led his party to its best result in 100 years. He&#xa0;outflanked the dominant left party, by focusing on jobs and low income tax relief, and so repositioning his moderates as \"the new workers' party\". This&#xa0;should be Cameron's ambition.</p>",
  "<p>With more than 50,000 US-born Latinos coming of voting age every month, Hispanic political power is fueled by youth. Especially here in swing-state Colorado, where November's presidential outcome is up for grabs.</p> <p>Nearly half of Colorado's Latino electorate falls in the 18-to-34 age group, and tapping into the rising power of Latino youth presents both a rich opportunity and a daunting challenge to Democrats, particularly here in the blue-collar city of Pueblo.</p> <p>Apathy runs deep and immigration politics don't play big here because border policies do not directly affect the lives of well over 90% of the local Latino population who were born in America and are thus native US citizens.</p> <p>Half of Pueblo's 106,595 residents are Hispanic, and this demographic should be ripe for Obama's re-election campaign to target. Yet, the political energy among Latino youth has ebbed since its highwater mark four years ago, professors and students at Colorado State University-Pueblo say.</p> <p>\"I don't think that we're very political,\" said Fawn Amber Montoya, the director of the Chicano studies program at CSU-Pueblo, after a long sigh. \"Pueblo really is dead when it comes to politics.\"</p> <p>No one doubts that Obama will, again, win Pueblo County as he did in 2008 with a crushing margin of 15 percentage points. But the question that could spell trouble for the Obama campaign is: how much political energy will the Obama re-election campaign garner from voters in this historic steel-mill city?</p> <p>Obama campaigned here twice in 2008, winning the state's nine electoral votes with a 9 percentage-point lead over John McCain. But there is a demographic deficit within the Latino community. Though it makes up a half of the overall population, it forms just a third of the 71,552 registered to vote in the town.</p> <p>Statewide, Hispanics make up about one-fifth of the population, and more than 434,000 Hispanics are eligible to vote, said Sindy Benavides of Voto Latino, a non-partisan organization that focuses on Latino civic engagement.</p> <p>The Latino population grew at more than twice Colorado's overall growth rate over the past decade. That trend is reflected nationwide, with the Latino youth representing the fastest-growing demographic in the US. More than 17 million Latinos under the age of 18 live in America, according to 2010 Census data, and there are more than 14.5 million young Hispanic eligible voters aged 18 to 34.</p> <p>In Colorado, there are 295,707 Hispanics between 18 and 34, the age group that Benavides's organization heavily targets. They make up 68% of eligible Hispanic voters in Colorado. Nationwide, 52,000 Hispanics turn 18 each month, and nine out of 10 of them are eligible to vote, Benavides said.</p> <p>\"When you start looking at that number, and you start looking at local state races, and even federal races, and how close some of them have been, then you start seeing why that impact is so great,\" Benavides said.</p> <p>Little wonder, then, that an Obama campaign office re-opened this February, early in the campaign cycle, in Pueblo's downtown, and that in June, Michelle Obama rallied about 1,000 people at the Colorado State Fairgrounds in Pueblo.</p> <p>Among Pueblo's population, only 3.8% are foreign-born, far less than the state's 9.8%. Most Latinos here date back here for generations. But many students at the CSU-Pueblo campus are, in fact, first-generation Americans.</p> <p>One such student is Perla Ontiveros, 21, who will be a first-time voter in the presidential election. She was formerly the president of the Mexican American student group on campus known as Mecha, Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztl\u00e1n, which promotes higher education and Latino cultural awareness.</p> <p>She and other Mecha members echoed Montoya's thought that Pueblo is far from buzzing with political energy. When asked if students are politically active on campus, Jeff Bazanele, 23, who graduated in May, said without hesitation, \"No. Absolutely not.\"</p> <p>\"Sometimes I refer to my students as being apolitical,\" said Dave Marquez, a CSU-Pueblo professor of Chicano Studies who is a Pueblo native and an activist from the Chicano movement. He and his wife were also Obama volunteers in 2008.</p> <p>Marquez's face glowed as he reminisced on the faded political energy of the 1970s he says is now missing from Hispanic youth in Pueblo.</p> <p>The most recent example he remembers of student political activism was seven years ago, when students mobilized against a professor who was said to be using class time for anti-immigration rants.</p> <p>\"That was the one time on campus when a lot of the apathy that would discourage me sometimes \u2026 we were able to eliminate that and get the whole campus motivated,\" Marquez said.</p> <p>But more recently, the Mecha students said they were \"fired up\" about a bill which a state senator from Pueblo sponsored that would create a more affordable tuition rate for undocumented students, a sort of modified version of the controversial Dream Act. In April, the bill was rejected for the sixth time by Republicans, who hold a one-seat majority in the Colorado assembly.</p> <p>One student who would have benefited from that bill is Diomara Balbuena, 17, of Pueblo. Balbuena, who is a few days shy of voting age, is not a legal citizen nor a legal resident of the US, since her parents brought her from Mexico as a child. She only realised the implications for her during her freshman year of high school.</p> <p>In a major immigration policy shift on June 15, Obama announced that young undocumented people, like Balbuena, would no longer be deported and could apply for work permits, if they met certain requirements \u2013&#xa0;but citizenship would remain out of reach.</p> <p>Because this news is so recent, Balbuena said she didn't apply to college when all her other friends did, even though she graduated high school with good grades. But with Obama's rule change, she now plans to apply for a work permit and a college place. \"It makes me really happy. Finally, we're getting our voices heard,\" Balbuena said after hearing the news. \"It's an unexplainable emotion \u2026&#xa0;to know we're not being left alone.\"</p> <p>While Balbuena is an example of a motivated young Hispanic who otherwise would turn out to vote for Obama, she's essentially left without a voice or a vote; but her three younger siblings, all born in the US, will eventually be able to vote, as will many of her fellow Latino friends.</p> <p>Obama's bold move on immigration resonated deeply among Latinos in and outside of Colorado. Whatever his motivation, the move was certainly good politics as an election-year ploy to win the crucial Latino vote.</p> <p>\"I think it's a first step, so I do applaud the president,\" said senator Angela Giron, a Democrat, who sponsored the immigrant tuition rate bill.</p> <p>\"He [Obama] is earning the Latino vote,\" said congressman Dan Pabon, a Democrat from north-west Colorado. \"I don't think the president can do much more than he's doing. I think the message is so targeted and so focused.\"</p> <p>But in Pueblo, Obama's immigration policy shift, while certainly welcome, does not directly affect the lives of 96% of Pueblo's Hispanic population. \"As much as immigration reform and what candidates are calling this big Hispanic issue areas in the election this year, I don't think that they're as tangible for the community in Pueblo,\" said Grace Lopez Ramirez, the Colorado director of Mi Familia Vota, a non-partisan organization that focuses on voter registration.</p> <p>Any of Colorado's 64 counties has the potential to sway the state in November, but given its large size Pueblo's Hispanic population is particularly well placed to make a strategic difference, said Rick Palacio, the chairman of Colorado's Democratic Party, a Pueblo native who is a sixth-generation Coloradan.</p> <p>Half of registered voters in the city of Pueblo are listed as Democrats, according to the Pueblo County Clerk's office. But actual voter turnout is a whole other challenge.</p> <p>\"There are barriers, [like] apathy among eligible voters,\" Palacio said. \"I think, oftentimes, people don't quite get the benefits to them of participating in our democracy.\"</p> <h2>Pueblo factbox</h2> <p>(All demographic data comes from the 2010 US census.

  "<p>It may be the height of their busy party conference season, but David Cameron and Ed Miliband have both found time lately to drop by at the post-industrial steel town of Corby and its ring of improbably pretty villages, east Northamptonshire's answer to the Cotswolds. Tired but exhilarated by his triumphant conference speech, Miliband paid his fourth visit on his way home from Manchester this week.</p> <p>Under the shoulder of 900-year-old Rockingham Castle (a Lord Rockingham was PM in the 18th century) the Labour leader deftly fielded questions \u2013 on unemployment, NHS cuts and immigration \u2013 from an invited, non-party audience in the village hall. If picture postcard Rockingham is part of One Nation Britain, then this is the thatched-roof Downton Abbey version.</p> <p>Why all this attention? Because a byelection is looming here on 15 November and the Corby seat usually swings with the national mood. The Tories held it in the Thatcher era, it fell to Labour when Tony Blair won power and went finally back again on a 3.4% swing when Cameron formed his coalition with the Lib Dems in 2010. Two recession-hit years later, One Nation Labour has high hopes of getting Corby back.</p> <p>Polling by the Tory moneyman Lord Ashcroft puts Labour 15% ahead. But if Labour is wooing the well-heeled villages, the Tories are piling cabinet ministers such as Chris Grayling \u2013 \"here with seven MPs on Thursday\" \u2013 into Labour Corby's estates, where Scots migrants to the steel industry (700 locals still make steel tubes for Tata) created the distinctive \"Corby accent\" as well as strong tribal loyalties.</p> <p>\"Is that a Scouse accent?\" Grayling asks a Labour householder on one suburban doorstep. \" No, no, it's Scottish.\"</p> <p>In the villages, the new justice secretary hears complaints about rural crime being ignored by the police. Elected police commissioners \u2013 voting for 41 of them is also on 15 November \u2013 will help rectify that, Grayling tells voters.</p> <p>The causal chain of events which has already attracted 12 candidates is more glamorous than Corby usually feels.</p> <p>Back in 2006, Cameron decided that chick-lit novelist, Louise Bagshawe (2m steamy copies sold) was just the sort of A-list candidate to fight this down-to-earth East Midlands seat.</p> <p>Once elected, the divorced mother of three married New York-based Peter Mensch, manager of rock groups such as Metallica and the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 2011. But juggling Corby and New York, the kids and her high-profile career as a Twitterati MP proved too much even for the precocious Mensch, 41. In August, she stepped down as an MP to move to the US.</p> <p>Despite mixed feelings towards their ex-MP (\"more interested in profile than policy\" snaps a busy businessman) there is residual sympathy for her problems with her work/life balance. But, apart from the new Tory candidate, Christine Emmett, a no-nonsense businesswoman of 55, the Guardian struggles to find anyone in the constituency who admits to having read a Bagshawe novel.</p> <p>Not village matrons in sensible shoes, nor trendy teenagers out with the boyfriend in Corby's new Willow Place shopping mall, part of a 20-year regeneration programme which saw the town (population 61,000) finally get a rail service to London (and a brand new station) in 2009.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397259895\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/5/1349457907841/Ed-Miliband-and-Andy-Swin-010.jpg\" alt=\"Ed Miliband and Andy Swinford\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Campaigning in Corby: Labour leader Ed Miliband with the party's candidate Andy Swinford.

Certainly not. If a book's not got blood and violence it's not for me,\" says Croot, 38, whose complex medical problems require treatment in London. She will vote for Labour's Andy Sawford: \"He helped my uncle when he had a stroke and his boss was nasty about it.\"</p> <p>In contrast to the cosmopolitan Mensch, Sawford claims \"at least eight generations\" of Northamptonshire roots. He campaigns on a \"Go local, Go Andy\" slogan. His dad, Phil Sawford, was MP for neighbouring Kettering until 2005. Selected even before Mensch resigned (there were rumours), Sawford, 35, has lived locally all his life and claims a long activist's pedigree. But he works in London as head of the Local Government Information Unit.</p> <p>So his opponents are quick to dub him a Labour princeling, a \"quangocrat\" who has been too quick to exploit the looming reorganisation of five local NHS hospitals. It could see Kettering general's 650 beds drastically reduced, to 100 on the worst case scenarios the Labour team insists are real. \"Scaremongering,\" counters Ukip's Margot Parker, who may take Tory votes. Sawford is unapologetic. His ambition is to become \"a strong MP and local champion\" for skills, investment and the NHS. In Rockingham, Miliband cautiously urges hospital officials to \"come clean\".</p> <p>Emmett, who trained as a buyer by M&amp;S and went on to handle \u00a3450m worth of procurement for the Channel Tunnel, has a grown-up daughter and is coming late to politics.</p> <p>Is it true a Tory leaflet mentioned \"North Hants\" by mistake? \"A mistake was made,\" she concedes, though clearly not by her. \"Don't you work for the Grauniad?\" Grayling interjects supportively as they traipse around a near-private estate in Corby that is more Labour than it looks.</p> <p>The Lib Dems admit that their candidate, Jill Hope, who raises bank loans for local businesses, is not in serious contention, though her big two rivals are after the 7,834 votes her party got last time. So are candidates running against controversial wind turbines planned for east Northants, including \"libertarian\" Daily Telegraph blogger, James Delingpole. \"Bird-slicing eco-crucifixes,\" he calls the turbines.</p> <p>Though his public meeting was held in Sudborough village hall, yards from the home of David Sparks, a pensioner, Sparks did not attend. But he's worried about the huge turbines he may soon see from his bedroom window.</p> <p>\"There's not much in it for local people except the inconvenience. It's on the Duke of Gloucester's land, so he'll do all right which is why a lot of people are objecting,\" he explains cheerfully as he gets off his motor mower before it rains.</p> <p>Does Sparks vote? Yes. Which way? He never says.</p> <p>That's what the candidates are up against in Corby: Scots who've never been to Scotland and bloody-minded pensioners. Labour will probably win here, but nothing is certain in 2012.</p>",

  "<p>Across America an electoral giant is stirring. The country's growing Latino population \u2013 projected to be almost a third of the US population by 2050 \u2013 is changing the demographic face of the nation, with potentially huge political consequences.</p> <p>Since 1986 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/01/latino-voter-eligibility-all-time-high\">it has more than tripled</a> from 7.5 million to 23.7 million this year.</p> <p>Several of the key battleground states that are likely to determine the result of the presidential election on 6 November have large Hispanic populations. In Florida, the quintessential swing state, there are 2.1million eligible Latino voters, one in six of the electorate.</p> <p>That's comfortably enough to sway the result in a state which Barack Obama won in 2008 by fewer than 250,000 votes over John McCain.</p> <p>Colorado, another key battleground state this year, has <a href=\"http://www.pewhispanic.org/category/election-fact-sheets/2010/\">one in eight eligible voters</a>, or 13%, who are Latino. Nevada has 224,000 eligible Hispanic voters, about 100,000 more than the margin by which Obama won the state last time.</p> <p>Despite the steadily rising strength of the American Latino community, it remains a relatively poorly understood and unrealised electoral force. What motivates Hispanic adults to back one candidate and not the other, or even vote at all?</p> <p>How are they responding to the increasingly hostile noises coming from the American right about the need to remove undocumented immigrants from the country? In what ways are young Hispanics, who themselves form a growing segment within this growing demographic, making use of their burgeoning power?</p> <p>To answer some of these questions, the Guardian teamed up with the <a href=\"http://annenberg.usc.edu/\">Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism</a> at the University of Southern California. Seven journalism students, directed by USC professors Marc Cooper and Alan Mittelstaedt, collaborated with the Guardian in a project to explore the sleeping giant of the Latino electorate.</p> <p>With funding help from <a href=\"http://news21.com/\">News21</a>, the journalism education project of the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the John S and James L Knift Foundation, the students fanned out across America to towns and cities selected in tandem with the Guardian. The towns \u2013 in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Pennsylvania, Texas and Washington state \u2013 all have one thing in common: an Hispanic population that is approaching or has already surpassed the majority 50% mark rendering these places \"majority-minority\" arbiters of the future of the US.</p> <p>The students' dispatches provide a fascinating snapshot of the American Latino population as we approach the November presidential election. The first thing that leaps out of them is the diversity of their communities.</p> <p>Contrary to the reductive uniformity imposed on Hispanics in much of the political debate, there is vast range depicted here. There are the established communities of San Antonio, Texas, and Pueblo, Colorado, where most of the Latinos have for generations enjoyed full US citizenship; in contrast to the more transient communities in Washington state.</p> <p>Some of the populations are largely Puerto Rican, as in Poinciana in central Florida; others overwhelmingly of Mexican descent as in Arizona and California. There are the apple- and grape-pickers of Washington state; the mushroom pickers and industrial workers of Pennsylvania; and the (now all-too often unemployed) tourism service workers in Florida.</p> <p>Such diversity apart, the political lesson that leaps out of so many of the reports is that the sleeping giant of the Latino voter remains just that \u2013 sleeping. Turnout at elections remains dismally low. Nationally, fewer than a third of Latino eligible voters cast their ballots in 2010 <a href=\" http://www.pewhispanic.org/2011/04/26/the-latino-electorate-in-2010-more-voters-more-non-voters/\">compared with almost half of whites</a> and 44% of black Americans.</p> <p>In Poinciana, Florida \u2013 a key electoral target in a key electoral state \u2013 Puerto Rican turnout is a miserable 17% compared with 80% in their country of origin.</p> <p>The report from Washington state makes the most depressing reading. In the fruit-picking haven of Yakima Valley in the south of the state, levels of representation for Latinos are reminiscent of the political invisibility that African Americans used to endure in the segregated deep south.</p> <p>The dispatches point to a regressive pattern of disenfranchisement of American Latinos. Because they tend to vote so anaemically, politicians tend to ignore them as an electoral force that merits wooing; because they are ignored they cannot see the point of turning out to vote.</p> <p>As Rick Palacio, chairman of Colorado's Democratic party and a sixth-generation Latino Coloradan, puts it: \"There is some apathy among eligible voters \u2013 people don't quite get the benefits to them of participating in our democracy.\"</p> <p>The economic hardship being felt by Hispanic communities more keenly than most American demographic groups merely heightens that circular pattern of disenfranchisement. It is no coincidence that most of our student reporters found themselves on the poorer side of town \u2013 amid neighborhoods vacated during the foreclosure crisis in Florida, or in a Pennsylvania rustbelt town where manufacturing has collapsed \u2013 because that is where most Hispanics live.</p> <p>Unemployment and the need for job creation runs through all the dispatches as a primary preoccupation. So too does scepticism that politicians of either party will provide meaningful answers. And so the sleeping giant slumbers on.</p> <p>And yet, there are signs of stirring. In Arizona, the people of the small town of Guadaulpe found their response \u2013 and as a result their political voice \u2013 to the heavy-handed police sweeps waged against their community by America's notorious \"toughest sheriff\" Joe Arpaio.</p> <p>On the night of one of his raids, the mayor Rebecca Jiminez stood up to Arpaio and told him she didn't want him or his \"posse\" to come back to the town. He was furious, but never did come back.</p> <p>In Arizona, such resistance has spilled over into political outcomes. Most symbolically, Russell Pearce, the leader of the Republicans in the state Senate who was the architect of the infamous crackdown on undocumented immigrants, SB 1070, was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/09/arizona-recall-latino-election-2012\">voted out of office</a>.</p> <p>Those seeds of change have been noted by politicians on both sides. Obama's re-election campaign opened an office in Pueblo, Colorado, in February, and has been intensely registering and courting Hispanic voters ever since.</p> <p>Polling data suggests that if Obama puts in the effort and gets his message across, he could persuade Latinos to push aside their doubts and cast their votes. In 2008, he won 67% Latino support and there is evidence that his decision to grant undocumented young Latinos a <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/18/obama-immigration-latino-voters-2012-election\">two-year respite from threat</a> of deportation is having a positive impact.</p> <p>There are also signs of the Republicans reflecting on their positions. In Santa Ana, California, a new brand of conservatism is emerging from elements of the Republican party. This strategy eschews the tough talk of \"attrition through enforcement\" and \"self-deportation\" that has epitomised much of the conservative discourse on immigration including that <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmrr6NGiA7M\">coming from the mouth of the presidential nominee Mitt Romney</a>.</p> <p>Instead, the new approach talks about guest worker programmes and providing temporary work permits that would allow undocumented immigrants a way out of illegality.</p> <p>Whether or not such new thinking continues to develop within both main parties will depend largely on the final theme that emerges strongly from the student dispatches: the question of youth. If the sleeping giant ever wakes up, it will be the young voters who kick it out of bed.</p> <p>Every year about 600,000 American Latinos, with full voting rights, turn 18. Couple that with the fact that more than a third of the nationwide Hispanic population is under 18, and this transcends into a electoral time bomb.</p> <p>Will young Latinos sieze the day, or allow apathy to continue to dissipate their power? The seven dispatches presented here from the changing face of America provide a few clues to that increasingly urgent question.</p>",
  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>A baby boy starved to death in Westminster as his seriously ill and \"socially isolated\" mother struggled to obtain proper housing, benefits and support, a serious case review into his death has revealed.</p> <p>An inquest returned a verdict of accidental death, noting that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/mar/24/baby-starved-death-london\" title=\"\">baby, known as Child EG, died</a> after his mother developed a rare brain infection, rendering her unconscious, so unable to feed her child. She died two days after her son.</p> <p>However, the full serious case review highlights a number of failings that contributed to the family's vulnerability in the months before the tragedy.</p> <p>The child's mother found it difficult to obtain benefits after her asylum application was approved and she found herself caught between two separate support systems, the review notes. \"There were significant problems in the transition from National Asylum Support Service (Nass) to mainstream benefits.\"</p> <p>The family had become \"destitute\" because of the withdrawal of the service's support, a critical letter from the chair of Westminster's independent local safeguarding children's board notes, and were being given cash handouts by healthcare workers and social services \"to tide them over\".</p> <p>The safeguarding children board's recommendations were released this week to Inside Housing magazine.</p> <p>Although it was his mother's illness which was the direct cause of Child EG's death, the review points to weaknesses in the support system for asylum seekers whose applications are granted, which can mean they wait weeks before they are transferred to a new benefits system.</p> <p>These changes meant that both in Westminster, and in the family's previous home, in the Midlands \"the family became dependent upon ad hoc payments by local agencies, which must have added to Mrs G's anxiety and, in consequence, to her difficulty in managing her children and their collective health needs\". A requirement for her to \"become homeless before the local authority or Benefits Agency could assist her left Mrs G in an extremely uncertain position. Uncertainty about where one might be living next day would be worrying for anyone. For Mrs G and, in particular, FG [her three-year-old daughter] who was old enough to be aware of her mother's anxiety, it must have been extremely difficult.\"</p> <p>The case prompted the independent Westminster local safeguarding children board to call for a better \"joined up\" system, to improve the transition \"without households having to face the additional stress of uncertainty and insecurity\".</p> <p>Because of chronic medical conditions, the family was receiving \"significant levels of health and other support services\", the review notes.</p> <p>Mrs G called an ambulance early 8 March 2010 to say that her son was having difficulty breathing. When the ambulance staff arrived, paramedics noted that the baby had been dead for some time. An initial postmortem found there was no food in the baby's stomach or digestive tract. He was described as \"seriously underweight and dehydrated\", which was noted as \"clearly the immediate cause of death\"</p> <p>His mother was arrested on suspicion of neglect but also rushed to hospital where she was admitted to the high dependency unit and told doctors she had not eaten for two days. She died two days later.</p> <p>James Thomas, director of family services at Westminster city council, said: \"This was clearly a tragic case involving a family with complex health needs.</p> <p>\"We share the Westminster safeguarding children board's concerns about the current transitional support available to successful asylum seekers before they are linked up to mainstream support services.\"</p> <p>Dave Garratt, the chief executive of Refugee Action, said: \"The transition from Nass support to full state benefit entitlement funded by the Department for Work and Pensions continues to fail some of the most vulnerable and marginalised people in society. Unacceptable delays in these transition arrangements are all too common, resulting in homelessness and hunger.\"</p>",
  "<p>The row over student visas at London Metropolitan university has done \"huge damage to the image of British higher education\", according to the new head of the London School of Economics.</p> <p>In his first interview since starting the job, <a href=\"http://www2.lse.ac.uk/newsAndMedia/news/archives/2011/11/director.aspx\" title=\"\">Craig Calhoun</a> said the crisis over overseas students at London Met, in north London, had \"played in places like India as a gratuitous assault on, and insult to, Indian students\".</p> <p>Calhoun revealed that he and other British vice-chancellors are been lobbying the government over the requirement that overseas students must register with police within seven days of arrival.</p> <p>Increased demand has led to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/oct/02/international-students-queue-into-night-to-register-with-police\" title=\"\">students queueing overnight</a> outside the south London office where they must register.</p> <p>Calhoun said: \"I think perhaps an even more inexplicable act of gratuitous embarrassment is the police registration system. First off it's pointless because this information is already gathered when people get visas. The whole registration system should be scrapped.</p> <p>\"Secondly, if you were going to require registration, and tell students they have seven days to register with the police, then you have an obligation to make it possible. It could not be better organised if the goal was to embarrass the government of the country.\"</p> <p>The Metropolitan police last night agreed to change the procedure for overseas students in London. From Monday, universities will be able to coordinate the process for them, while students will have until 31 December rather than just seven days to comply.</p> <p>The UK Border Agency revoked London Met's licence to take overseas students in August, saying the university \"failed to address serious and systematic failings\". The decision affected up to 2,600 and left the university, which denied the claims, facing a \u00a330m loss. London Met has since won a partial victory in the courts, which allowed 1,000 students to start their courses.</p> <p>In a statement, a UK Border Agency spokesman defended the decision to revoke the licence as \"the right course of action\". He said: \"We will continue to fight their [legal] challenge at the full hearing.\"</p> <p>The LSE, where almost half of students were from outside the EEA in 2010-11, is heavily reliant on overseas income. Calhoun is the successor to Howard Davies, who quit last year over LSE's links to the Gaddafi regime.</p> <p>The new director called for students to be exempt from the government's immigration cap. He said: \"The LSE and Oxford and Cambridge and every other university suffers when the image of British higher education is undermined.\"</p> <p>In the interview, Calhoun indicated that the LSE's tuition fee for home undergraduates is likely to be revised upwards from the \u00a38,500 a year it currently charges. Alone among Russell Group institutions, it does not charge the maximum of \u00a39,000.</p> <p>Calhoun said the fee would be reviewed in the knowledge that it had not deterred applicants. The university, he said knew that its applicants understood the \"difference between sticker price and bottom line\".</p> <p>\"My own preference would be that fees be set in a way that covers the cost of enrolling students at a first-rate institution and that we also secure other revenue so that we can provide scholarships to reduce how much of these fees we have to charge students that are less well-off.\"</p> <p>The LSE is undertaking a strategic review that will examine underperforming areas and look at whether it should take on more students. The review will also examine whether the LSE should set up an overseas campus, as the universities minister, David Willetts, is urging it to do.</p> <p>Calhoun said: \"We're undertaking a strategic review to look at everything from the size and shape of school, the proportion of graduate to undergraduate [degrees]. I think we need to look at the whole offer.\"</p> <p>The LSE has more than doubled its intake between 1980 and 2010. Calhoun said the review would look at whether the university was now the right size or should expand further.</p> <p>Some of Britain's top universities have grown this year by taking advantage of new freedoms to recruit unlimited numbers of UK undergraduates with A-level grades of AAB or higher.</p> <p>In London, Kings and University College London have \"grown substantially\", Calhoun noted. UCL was due to add another 300 British undergraduates this academic year, and is expanding beyond its Bloomsbury home to a new campus in Newham, east London.</p> <p>Calhoun said: \"There are possible reasons to grow in the lifting of the AAB cap, in the extent to which our neighbours like Kings or UCL have grown substantially. We should consider that. It doesn't mean that we'll choose it. We might decide its a mistake and we want to avoid it.\"</p> <p>The LSE director is also keen for the university to \"connect up the different fields\" in which it operates.</p> <p>\"The way in which we look at climate change has something that connects geography to economics, the way we look at cities as something that connects sociology to geography to economics to other fields.</p> <p>\"Lots of the innovation in social science comes from crossing boundaries, bringing together people who have different backgrounds to look at the same question. I have no immediate agenda to create a new department. There's no discipline that I think is missing. The issue is whether we are bringing together the different kinds of perspectives we need to tackle the questions we have today.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Tesco</strong> fell to a two month low in a rising market, as investors checked out of the supermarket group's shares in the wake of its first profit fall for twenty years.</p> <p>The company reported half year figures on Wednesday showing trading profits dropped 10.5% to \u00a31.6bn, prompting concerns about its poor UK performance and growing problems in its international business. It closed down 2.8p at 315.35p, its worst level since the start of August as analysts queued up to downgrade the business. Kate Calvert and Freddie George at Seymour Pierce said:</p> <blockquote> The market was prepared for a decline in profits from Tesco, but we believe its first half results were disappointing even in that context. We have reappraised our forecast and cut 2013 and 2014 [earnings] by 8% and 14% respectively. With no visibility on where UK profitability will bottom and too many of its overseas businesses face trading issues shorter term, we reiterate our reduce recommendation and cut our target price to 290p from 310p. </blockquote> <p>Caroline Gulliver at Espirito Santo said:</p> <blockquote> The deteriorating outlook for Tesco's international business, for both structural and cyclical growth, leads us to cut our group pretax profit estimates by 10% for 2013 and 16% for 2014. We believe Tesco is in transition and may well emerge a well-run, mature retailer with operating margins of over 5% and a cashflow yield above 10%. At which point we would see value in the shares up to 380p. But we are not there yet and with several obstacles on the path we cut our fair value by 10% to 300p and keep our neutral rating. </blockquote> <p>Overall the market end the week on a positive note, boosted by better than expected US jobs figures, with the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finishing 43.24 points higher at 5871.02. Despite continuing concerns about the eurozone crisis - with the problems in Spain, Greece and Portugal far from resolved - the leading index added nearly 130 points over the course of the week.</p> <p>Commodity companies were among the main gainers after the US data suggested brighter prospects for the global economy. <strong>Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation</strong> led the way, up 18.6p to 333.3p. Analysts at Credit Suisse said:</p> <blockquote> With the strong pick-up in nickel prices (lead indicator for stainless demand), rising stainless prices in Europe and potential supply risk in South Africa (strike risk spreading) we expect the fourth quarter to be a trough for prices and, given very weak recent performance, ENRC shares could see improved momentum near term. </blockquote> <p>Fellow Kazakh miner <strong>Kazakhmys</strong> climbed 31.5p to 738p, while <strong>Vedanta Resources</strong> rose 36p to \u00a311.01. <strong>Evraz</strong>, the Russian steelmaker controlled by Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich, recovered from a fall on Thursday in the wake of news it was taking a majority stake in coal miner Raspadskaya. Its shares ended 9p to 254.1p. In a hold note, analysts at Societe Generale said:</p> <blockquote> The deal is somewhat unexpected but is the logical conclusion to a prolonged saga of love and resistance as Evraz made unsuccessful takeover attempts before. The valuation looks pricey but we expect limited impact on the share price. </blockquote> <p>But engineering and design firm <strong>WS Atkins</strong> fell nearly 5%, down 34p to 695p after reports its role in the West Coast franchise fiasco was being investigated. The franchise was taken away from the winner, <strong>FirstGroup</strong>, after irregularities in the bidding process. Atkins - along with law firm Eversheds - had reportedly been hired in January to give technical advice on the franchise process. David Brockton at Espirito Santo said:</p> <blockquote> Should any review find Atkins to have been at fault during this tender process, then clearly it could have a negative reputational impact for the group, given this represents a high profile tender. <br> </blockquote> <p>Andy Brown at Panmure Gordon added:</p> <blockquote> [The report] is unlikely to be helpful for the share price in the short term. That said, Atkins has strong rail expertise so we expect it to continue to play an active role in a strategically important infrastructure sector over the medium term. <br> Previously it suffered from negative sentiment surrounding its involvement in Metronet [the Tube consortium] but that did not stop it winning future government related work. </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile FirstGroup fell 4.5p to 196.1p having lost 20% on the day the franchise was withdrawn.</p> <p>Elsewhere energy services business <strong>Wood Group</strong> added 22.5p to 833.5p after an upbeat trading statement, with the company saying it was confident of meeting full year expectations. The engineering division continues to perform well, with a number of contracts in the Gulf of Mexico, and it confirmed its contract problems in Oman would lead to a $15m-$20m loss from its business there.</p> <p>Keith Morris at Investec kept his hold rating an 800p price target:</p> <blockquote> Today's statement does not highlight any significant changes to the 2012 outlook since the Interims at the end of August. With a rating in line with its large cap peers, we see no specific catalysts for outperformance. </blockquote> <p><strong>Kingfisher</strong> climbed 1.6p to 270.3p despite Morgan Stanley downgrading the DIY chain from overweight to equal-weight. It said the retailer's shares had been weighed down by concerns about its French business, but investors should possibly be more worried about B&amp;Q in the UK:</p> <blockquote> B&amp;Q has delivered just five quarters of positive like for like growth in the last 7.5 years. Gross margin improvements and cost savings have mitigated the top-line weakness thus far, but with first half profits down 24%, we fear that 'self help' may no longer be enough to sustain the chain's recovery. </blockquote> <p><strong>AstraZeneca</strong> added 7.5p to 2918.5p, as traders suggested Monday's decision by new chief executive Pascal Soriot to halt its share buyback programme could mean it was on the takeover trail. US group Forest Laboratories was one name mentioned as a possible target.</p> <p>Among the mid-caps, the biggest loser was <strong>Kcom</strong>. The telecoms group fell 5.6p to 78.75p after reporting lower than expected growth in its business and public sector markets.</p> <p><strong>Mitchells &amp; Butlers</strong> rose 5.6p to 306.6p after this week's news that horseracing tycoons JP McManus and John Magnier had bought 7m shares in the pubs group through their Elpida vehicle, taking their stake to 22.47%. Joe Lewis, the billionaire currency trader, owns 26.3% and saw two bids for the business rejected last year. Shareholders have been unhappy about the dominance of the major shareholders, with no independent directors on the board.</p> <p>In a buy note Nick Batram at Peel Hunt moved from hold to buy. He said:</p> <blockquote> Few would argue that M&amp;B has not got a high quality estate, but extracting the full potential from its assets has proved frustratingly difficult. This has been further compounded by the boardroom sideshow played out over the past few years. However, we believe that a platform (built on management stability and culture change) is now in place to finally deliver the potential that M&amp;B has long held. </blockquote> <p>Finally <strong>Pursuit Dynamics</strong> lost a quarter of its value, down 2.05p to 6.075p after the company said it was seeking new funding as it awaited firm orders for its process technology equipment. It hopes to provide an update by the end of the month. In March this year the company raised \u00a39.4m with a rights issue, eight months after an \u00a38m placing. It said:</p> <blockquote> [The company] has a growing pipeline of quotations and prospects in its public health &amp; safety and brewing, food &amp; beverage businesses, a number of which the board believes will be converted into orders in due course but their timing is such that they will not eliminate the need for additional funding. </blockquote>",
  "<p>Scotland Yard has drafted in immigration officials to each of London's 72 custody suites in a drive to target foreigners arrested in the capital.</p> <p>Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe was believed to be the driving force behind Operation Terminus; a pan-London project under which teams of trained police and UK Border Agency officials have been quietly deployed to every custody suite in London.</p> <p>The force said it was determined to deal more effectively with the 70,000 foreign nationals arrested each year. They comprise, it said, a third of those arrested.</p> <p>A briefing note, circulated on Friday and seen by the Guardian, specifically highlighted the heightened powers of the Border Force to deal with criminals who had committed offences here, were wanted in other countries or had failed \"to comply with the 'being of good behaviour' conditions of their UK residency, by causing harm and risk to others\".</p> <p>\"This operation will not change the MPS [Metropolitan police service] relationship with the general public,\" it said. \"The MPS remains committed to supporting and engaging all London's communities and will continue to uphold the human rights of everyone it comes into contact with, particularly victims and witnesses of crime, irrespective of their immigration status.\"</p> <p>But the pan-London project, which will last six months and follows a well-regarded pilot, has already encountered heavy criticism from refugee and migrant representatives, who fear the Met will in effect behave as an arm of the Border Agency. Politicians also demanded more details about how the Met would keep itself distinct.</p> <p>One group warned the London mayor, Boris Johnson, that as things stood, it may advise clients to avoid any dealings with the police. \"It is already extremely difficult to get individuals to report crimes where they feel vulnerable to harsh treatment as the result of experiences from their country of origin,\" said Rita Chadha of the Refugee and Migrant Forum of east London. \"I would draw your attention to specific incidences where vulnerable victims, especially those affected by domestic violence and other forms of violence may now be even more reluctant to report crime for fear of retribution, from a perpetrator who will be additionally aggrieved for having been bought into contact with the UKBA [UK Border Agency].\"</p> <p>A Met spokeswoman sought to ease concerns: \"The MPS continues to target offenders who have been arrested for criminal offences in the UK and may also be subject to being wanted for offences overseas or here illegally, working with the UK Border Agency,\" she said. \"This is not about us targeting specific communities but about us targeting criminality.</p> <p>\"This is an issue that as we understand it currently, will force us as an advice agency to sometimes advise clients not to report to the police incidences.\"</p> <p>Len Duvall, leader of the Labour group on the London assembly, said it would seek more detail from the mayor and the commissioner. \"Is this about dealing with serious criminal behaviour or just about supporting the UK Border Agency in its work, at a time when the Met itself is stretched? We cannot get to a situation where the police are seen as part of the immigration service and people don't feel able to deal with them in confidence.\"</p> <p>Claude Moraes, the London MEP and former director of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said: \"This is a significant development. It is important that foreign criminals are dealt with effectively. But there may also be serious issues of due process thrown up by this.\"</p> <p>Jenny Jones, a Green party member of the London assembly, called for clear safeguards. \"In the past, the Met's work with immigration officers has lead to poor detection, simply because the urgency to deport people, for example trafficked women, meant that the criminal bosses escaped detection.</p> <p>\"This could make a valuable contribution to tackling organised, serious crime. However, I would have real concerns if we were putting resources into chasing petty thieves because they were 'foreign' when the cuts are threatening our ability to field sufficient officers to deal properly with homegrown cases of rape and other serious crimes.\"</p> <p>The Met briefing made clear its appreciation of the sensitivities. It said lay advisers and figures from \"current and emerging communities\" in London had already been consulted about the way the project would work.</p> <p>\"It is stressed that Operation Terminus targets offenders and not communities. The start point is always the person has been arrested for a criminal offence and is in custody or has significant intelligence or convictions linking them to criminal offending (ie the MPS deals with criminals). This is not about the MPS becoming an immigration agency, it is about the service becoming better able to deal with criminal offenders who, as foreign nationals, we know less about.\"</p> <p>Senior officers and officials in the mayor's office are aware of concerns, widely expressed after last year's riots, that the Met has allowed its relationships with minority communities to wither. But there is also pressure from national government to get a grip on immigration and deport more foreign offenders.</p> <p>The situation is complicated where those offenders are EU nationals. Under a reciprocal arrangement, they can be sent to serve sentences in their home countries but as EU citizens, they can re-enter the UK thereafter.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>9.40am: A study by engineers based at the <a href=\"http://www.ntnu.edu/research/energy-environment\">Norwegian University of Science and Technology</a> has questioned some common assumptions about the environmental credentials of electric cars.</p> <p>Published this week in the Journal of Industrial Ecology, the \"<a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2012.00532.x/full\">comparative environmental life cycle assessment of conventional and electric vehicles</a>\" begins by stating that \"it is important to address concerns of problem-shifting\". By this, the authors mean that by solving one problem, do electric cars create another? And, if so, does this environmental harm then outweigh any advantages?</p> <p>The study highlights in particular the \"toxicity\" of the electric car's manufacturing process compared to conventional petrol/diesel cars. It concludes that the \"global warming potential\" of the process used to make electric cars is twice that of conventional cars.</p> <p>The study also says - as has been noted many times before - that electric cars do not make sense if the electricity they consume is produced predominately by coal-fired power stations. \"It is counterproductive to promote [electric vehicles] EVs in regions where electricity is produced from oil, coal, and lignite combustion,\" it concludes.</p> <p>So, should this new study make us reassess the environmental credentials of electric cars? Or does the analysis and data help us, as the authors insist, improve the environmental performance of electric cars? As they say:</p> <blockquote> <p>Although EVs are an important technological breakthrough with substantial potential environmental benefits, these cannot be harnessed everywhere and in every condition.</p> </blockquote> <p>Please leave your thoughts below. If you are quoting figures or other studies, please provide a link through to the original source. I will also be inviting various interested parties to join the debate, too. And later on today, I will return with my own verdict.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>10.09am: There has already been some reaction <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WillN_BG/status/254133434195251201\">via Twitter</a> asking if the study is \"well-to-wheel\", namely, does it also include the emissions caused during the extraction/production of petrol/diesel?</p> <p>I have just received an email from <a href=\"http://www.ntnu.edu/employees/guillaume.majeau-bettez\">Guillaume Majeau-Bettez</a>, one of the authors, answering this precise point:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Yes, our study covers the whole production chain of the cars and of the fuels, the use phase, and the end of life.</p> </blockquote> <p>P.S.

Here's the key conclusion:</p> <blockquote> <p>The production phase of EVs proved substantially more environmentally intensive. Nonetheless, substantial overall improvements in regard to GWP [global warming potential], TAP [terrestrial acidification potential], and other impacts may be achieved by EVs powered with appropriate energy sources relative to comparable ICEVs [internal combustion engine vehicles]. However, it is counterproductive to promote EVs in regions where electricity is produced from oil, coal, and lignite combustion. The electrification of transportation should be accompanied by a sharpened policy focus with regard to life cycle management, and thus counter potential setbacks in terms of water pollution and toxicity. EVs are poised to link the personal transportation sector together with the electricity, the electronic, and the metal industry sectors in an unprecedented way. Therefore the developments of these sectors must be jointly and consistently addressed in order for EVs to contribute positively to pollution mitigation efforts.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>10.38am: In the comment below, @MartynW <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18666888\">asked</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><br>Does this study take account of cars being one of the most recycled products we use?</p> </blockquote> <p>Guillaume Majeau-Bettez, one of the paper's authors, has just emailed me this in response:</p> <blockquote> <p>The crucial importance of recycling is one of the conclusions of our analysis. There are different ways to account for recycling in Life Cycle Assessment. We have chosen to analyse a \"first wave\" of electric vehicles, made from average metal mixes (a fraction virgin and a fraction from recycling). Hopefully, subsequent \"waves\" of electric cars would be made with a higher fraction of recycled metal (ecars made from ecars, cradle-to-cradle...), but the industry is not there yet.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>11.24am: Many thanks for the great response from readers so far.

For human toxicity, our study partly addresses the difference between emissions to densely populated and less populated areas, though this could certainly be improved. However, we cannot think only of the toxicity on humans; we also address toxic impacts on aquatic life and ecosystems.</p> <p>@Seb: This is one of our core finding: because the production of an electric car causes roughly twice the climate impact of producing a comparable conventional car, it must run on rather clean electricity to \"make up\" for the initial climate impact.<br>Further on @Seb: All use phase energy requirements were based on industry performance tests with the New European Driving Cycle, following the UNECE 101 regulation (UNECE 2005). These tests combine four elementary urban<br>driving cycles and one extra-urban driving cycle, with regenerative charging and energy losses during overnight charging included for EVs.</p> <p>@Guess11: Following industry standard, we based our assessment of the use-phase on the \"New European Driving Cycle\", which includes a typical share of stop-start.</p> <p>As many readers point out, the electric car industry is young and will likely improve in the future. We studied the present generation of electric car, we refrained from making predictions.</p> <p>good dialogue.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 7 --> <p>11.52am: I've just received this reaction from a spokeswoman at the <a href=\"http://www.smmt.co.uk/\">Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Electric vehicles represent one option within a range of technologies that help motorists to lower their emissions. The automotive industry manufactures \u2013 or is developing \u2013 a broad array of low and ultra-low carbon vehicles, from highly efficient petrol and diesel models, through gas, biofuel and hydrogen, to hybrid, plug-in hybrid, pure-electric and fuel cell vehicles. Every year, the latest drivetrain technologies see emissions reduced, with today's new cars emitting on average 20% less than their 10 year old counterparts. Significant investment is ongoing, with worldwide R&amp;D powering the continuous improvement of existing technologies and the introduction of other low carbon innovations.<br>In terms of the lifecycle emissions of electric vehicles, the energy industry in Europe is constrained by legally binding limits on the total amount of CO2 emitted each year, up to 2020 (EU Emissions Trading Scheme 2009/29/EC). This limit reduces year-on-year to achieve an overall reduction in CO2 emissions. This means, in practice, that if overall energy demand increases as a result of electric vehicles (or for any other reason) then the increase in demand must be met with electricity from renewable or zero carbon generation sources.<br>In addition, measures such as the EU's Renewable Energy Directive, which requires 20% of renewable energy by 2020, are positive strategies to achieve CO2 reductions while the European Emissions Trading Scheme requires electricity suppliers to reduce their overall CO2 emissions.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 8 --> <p>12.11pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18668194\">Robert Wilson</a>, from the University of Strathclyde's department of mathematics, raises an important point below the line:</p> <blockquote> <p>Simply decarbonizing electricity assuming no increases to demand appears to be a massive challenge. Our choice on transportation appears to be between increased fuel efficiency, a switch to \"cleaner\" fossil fuels and a push for increased public transportation, or aiming for something like 100% electric cars. The first approach is guaranteed some level of success. The second, however will fail completely if the electricity grid is not fully decarbonized. What we really need to do here is reframe this question, and instead ask not whether electric cars are bad for the environment, but how many of them are bad for the environment.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 9 --> <p>12.15pm: Touching on the same themes as this week's paper, <a href=\"http://healthland.time.com/2012/02/14/why-electric-cars-are-more-polluting-than-gas-guzzlers-at-least-in-china/\">Time magazine ran this feature</a> last February on why the use of electric cars in China - where \"about 85% of the country's electricity is powered by fossil fuels, of which 95% is coal\" - is causing an environmental headache:</p> <blockquote> <p>Kilometer per kilometer, electric cars in China beat out conventional vehicles as among the worst environmental polluters. On average, the fine particulate emissions per passenger-km are 3.6 times greater for electric cars than for gasoline cars. That's better than for diesel cars but on par with diesel buses, which can spread their environmental impact across the number of passengers they carry. \"If we compare gasoline car emissions to electric car emissions, the electric cars look very, very bad,\" says Christopher Cherry, an assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at University of Tennessee. \"So the point is that you have to consider the emissions exposure when the exposure source is far apart \u2014 the electrical power plant as opposed to the tailpipe of a car.\"</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 10 --> <p>12.30pm: As background reading, I have examined the issue of whether \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-living-blog/2011/jan/17/electric-car-emissions\">electric cars really produce fewer emissions</a>\" before.

This applies over a full life cycle, taking account of emissions from power generation and emissions relating to production and disposal.

We need to know the facts about electric cars, their true total impact. Here I will point out something, we still don't know the true impact of the internal combustion cars and the fuel they use. This information is obfuscated by historical habit, for 100 years no one wanted to know. For example, how much electricity from coal burning power plants goes into refining oil? Try and find out how much per gallon? I've asked when filming at a massive oil refinery that had it's own set of pylons coming from a nearby coal burner. No one wants to tell you. (estimates range from between 4 -7 kWh per gallon) We know we need to change the way we generate electricity, with or without electric vehicles this is vitally important. We know what comes out of the tailpipe of an ICE car, toxic and carcinogenic gasses which cause untold levels of harm to human beings. We do know that 100 miles in an electric car uses around 24kWh, in an ICE car around 110 kWh. So from a global energy perspective that's a massive reduction in energy needs.<br>We do know that most EV drivers charge the car at night when the amount of coal burnt to produce electricity is at it's lowest, we know that coal makes up under 30% of the UK grid supply during peak times. We know that most people who drive EV's also install solar panels, I have. In one year, my Nissan Leaf used 5,340 kWh and my solar panels produced 3,555 kWh. We know that an electric car can run on electricity from any source, a fossil burner can only burn fossils.<br>So what about the battery toxicity? Are we just going to throw away the battery after the car has done 150,000 miles? No, of course not. Nissan are about to open a massive battery re-cycling plant at their Sunderland works. What about the massive piles of worn parts the traditional motor industry produces, clutches, waste lubricating oil, the platinum in catalytic converters, filters, pumps, the list goes on and on. Are they thrown away? of course not, they are recycled. What about the materials that go into making traditional cars, sourced and shipped from all over the world. The true well to wheel argument is a minefield, and this report has dived in feet first. Good luck to them.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 14 --> <p>1.10pm: Here's another email from Guillaume Majeau-Bettez, one of the paper's authors, this time on the question that I put to him about whether they had also looked at regional variations when it came to the carbon intensity of electricity production. For example, in terms of reducing emissions, is the US grid better or worse than Europe's for charging electric cars?</p> <blockquote> <p>This is outside the original scope of our study. We did not address electric vehicles on a region-per-region basis, but rather on a per-electricity-source basis. This can get quite complex; the electricity mix in any given point can differ from the average (national, regional) mix, and will also fluctuate with time (time of day, season, etc.) Speaking in general terms, however, the average US grid is more fossil fuel and global warming intensive than the European grid.</p> <p>Referring to the latest \"Life Cycle Inventories of Electricity Mixes and Grid\", the US mix causes roughly 800 gCO2-equivalent per kWh of low voltage electricity at grid, compared to roughly 500 for the European mix. (see <a href=\"http://www.esu-services.ch/fileadmin/download/publicLCI/itten-2012-electricity-mix.pdf\">http://www.esu-services.ch/fileadmin/download/publicLCI/itten-2012-electricity-mix.pdf</a> - p. 207)</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 15 --> <p>2.12pm: <a href=\"http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/people/marcello.contestabile\">Dr Marcello Contestabile</a>, a research fellow at the <a href=\"http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/icept\">Centre for Energy Policy and Technology</a> at Imperial College London who specialises in battery technologies \"in the context of road transport\", has emailed me his thoughts:</p> <blockquote> <p>In the last few years there has been a lot of hype around electric vehicles and as a result their environmental credentials have often been somewhat overstated. However, experts are well aware of the fact that well-to-wheel carbon emissions of EVs are strongly dependent on the carbon intensity of the electricity used, and that in extreme cases these could even be higher than those of conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. Lifecycle environmental impacts of electric vehicles are comparatively less well understood and hence studies such as Hawkins et al are needed.<br>In a recent consultancy piece I have conducted with other colleagues at Imperial College (<a href=\"http://www.lcaworks.com/EV%20Lit%20Rev%20FINAL.pdf\">http://www.lcaworks.com/EV%20Lit%20Rev%20FINAL.pdf</a>), we arrive at results that are largely in agreement with Hawkins et al. In particular, we have focused on greenhouse gas emissions and we have reviewed previous studies showing that manufacturing of electric vehicles, and particularly batteries, is likely to be more energy intensive than that of conventional internal combustion engines. However, this can be more than offset over the lifetime of the vehicle if the latter is powered by low carbon electricity and the battery lifetime is comparable to that of an internal combustion engine.<br>In our piece we also argue that the fact that battery technology is still evolving could help mitigating the problem. In fact, for electric vehicles to gain a significant share of the market the cost and weight of batteries need to reduce significantly and their durability increase. Reducing costs involves using cheaper materials, and hence those based on less energy intensive materials would be favoured; reducing weight means using lighter but also less material per unit energy stored, which again could reduce the overall environmental impact of battery manufacturing.<br>In conclusion, it is plausible that the currently higher environmental impact of manufacturing electric vehicles will naturally reduce somewhat if these are adopted on a large scale; at the same time, decarbonising power generation is imperative and it is in this context that electric vehicles should be considered. However, both my analysis and Hawkins et al also suggest that more research on lifecycle impacts of electric vehicles (and indeed any other vehicle technology) is necessary and that road transport policies need to better account for these impacts in order to provide a level playing field where more environmentally benign technologies are adequately rewarded.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 16 --> <p>2.24pm: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/electricandy\">Andy Heiron</a>, Renault UK's head of <a href=\"http://www.renault-ze.com/en-gb/z.e.-news/renault-uk-puts-ev-case-forward-in-fuels-of-the-future-debate-81315.html\">electric vehicle programme</a>, has sent me his thoughts:</p> <blockquote> <p>Most of the environmental impact of a car comes in use and in this respect EV's already offer a significant 'well to wheel' advantage, even with the relatively 'dirty' grid mix in the UK. Taking into account the proposed Committee on Climate Change target of 300g/KWh, this would equate to w2w for <a href=\"http://www.renault-ze.com/en-gb/z.e.-range/zoe/renault-zoe-expression-1944.html\">ZOE</a> (210km range, NEDC) of 31.4g/km, and I cannot see ICE technology getting close to that level by 2020.<br>Without access to, or the time to study, this report, it's difficult to add much on the production impacts, but the statement the production of EV's has twice the global warming impact seems high, and perhaps, as one of the authors admitted, reflects the current reality of (low volume) production. Again, I can only comment on the Renault situation where EV's are built in the same factories alongside ICE products and so suggest that a difference of this magnitude seems unlikely.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 17 --> <p>2.44pm: <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/about/dr-doug-parr-chief-scientist\">Doug Parr</a>, Greenpeace UK's chief scientist and policy director, <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/newsdesk/energy/data/data-do-electric-cars-cause-more-pollution-fossil-fuel-alternatives\">has responded</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Whilst unable to go over the report with a fine toothcomb, the broad conclusions seem right in that:</p> <p>1. <a href=\"http://www.lowcvp.org.uk/news/1644/lowcvp-study-highlights-importance-of-measuring-whole-life-carbon-emissions/\">Ricardo research for LowCVP</a> showed that the climate costs of production of electric vehicles are significant, in particular, in relation to the battery.

Once fabricated, running electric vehicles off a power system run by lignite will generate increased emissions rather than savings, and generally will off coal too.</p> <p>3. <a href=\"http://assets.wwf.org.uk/downloads/electric_vehicles_research.pdf\">Element Energy</a> have calculated that in 2030, even with EVs representing three-quarters of the total car stock, the additional demands are less than 10% of forecast electricity demand at that time for all end uses.</p> <p>4. It remains an environmental imperative to conserve scarce resources like the minerals and rare earths necessary for battery fabrication. Saving CO2 does not justify laxity on mining standards or waste management.</p> <p>5. The importance of electric vehicles \u2013 and hydrogen-fuelled ones - is that they provide a way of moving away from a hydrocarbon based transport system. Electric vehicle development and mass-production cannot just be switched on and off overnight. So EVs can be supported if there is a broad consensus that decarbonisation of the power system will take place, and a strong implementation plan in a country.</p> <p>6. However, the longer term options of technology change should not obscure the fact that in the short term most of the emissions savings in transport will come from better efficiency of petrol and diesel vehicles. Emissions standards for cars and vans, as are being discussed in Europe and member states this autumn, are the most important measure for reducing emissions over the next decade. Changes in vehicle technology and production that these standards require will generally be helpful in making EVs a more attractive commercial proposition.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 18 --> <p>4.37pm: </p> <h2>My verdict</h2> <p>The authors of this new paper are evidently not saying that electric cars are \"bad\" for the environment in all circumstances, but they are confirming what many already knew: that as electric cars become more popular - which is being encouraged by policymakers across many countries - we mustn't lose sight of the fact that the carbon intensity of the electricity used to power them is key. Another crucially important factor to monitor (and, hopefully, ameliorate) is just how energy- and resource-intensive the production of these vehicles can be.</p> <p>The problem for electric cars is that they will only increase their environmental credentials (compared to \"conventional\" cars) once more and more of them are made and used, which, in itself, will drive faster and deeper innovation in battery technology, production efficiencies and end-of-life recyclability. It's somewhat unfair to compare them to conventional cars at present because they are an immature, fledgling technology, but the opportunity for increased efficiency throughout their lifecycle seems significant as/if they become more popular.</p> <p>But a bigger problem, perhaps, is that their environmental \"success\" hangs largely on factors beyond their manufacturers' control. As has been shown in China, electric cars powered by electricity generated through the burning of coal and oil make very little environmental sense. They need to run off a low-carbon, \"smart\" grid where renewables and nuclear do much of the heavy lifting. So policy-makers have a twin challenge if they want to see more people driving electric cars: they need to ensure a low-carbon, smart grid is delivered and they need to assist manufacturers in bringing down the cost of these vehicles. Doing that in a synchronised and timely manner is going to be hard, but a prize worth reaching for.</p>",
  "<p>\u2712Since it is, quite rightly, open season on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/oct/03/jimmy-savile-abuse-allegations-next-legal-steps?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Jimmy Savile</a>, I might add my two penn'orth. I thought he was a terrible disc jockey, boring, repetitive and more interested in himself than any record or guest. Compared with, say, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/oct/03/tv-review-kenny-everett-story?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Kenny Everett</a>, who was a blazing talent, he was uninventive and predictable. He was the kind of person often described as \"larger than life\", which usually means a \"tedious old show-off\".</p> <p>He was almost inarticulate. \"Now then, now then,\" is not exactly the wittiest catchphrase. I once saw him interview a retired military officer for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim%27ll_Fix_It\" title=\"\">Jim'll Fix It</a>, or \"Jim'll Fix It If The BBC Can Get It For Free\", as it should have been called. The old chap had a collection of Victoria Cross medals. \"Now then, general, are any of these here medals any more different from the rest than what the others are?\" he inquired.</p> <p>People praised him for his charity work but, with some people, charity can be a form of aggression. The message is, \"I'm helping you, so love me.\" And he made sure we all knew about it. Doing good by stealth was not his style.</p> <p>Oddly enough his lascivious tastes were better known than you might imagine. When I chaired <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006r9yq\" title=\"\">The News Quiz</a>, we used to occasionally say things at the recording which we knew would be cut, but which might pique the audience into laughing even louder. Once I said something like, \"Yes, it's about Jimmy Savile, Britain's best-loved celebrity paedophile.\" I expected a gasp, but instead got a knowing laugh. Almost everyone, it seemed, had heard the stories.</p> <p>There are many things people know, or think they know, bits of information passed round like samizdat manuscripts in the Soviet Union: such and such a film star is gay, a politician likes young boys \u2013 that kind of thing. Now and again someone tells us journalists, \"Of course, you know, but you can't print it, can you?\" with a secretive chuckle. And, more often than you might think, it actually is true.</p> <p>Shortly after he died, the <a href=\"http://www.theoldie.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Oldie magazine </a>ran an article about Savile preying on underage girls, but it was completely ignored.</p> <p>\u2712<a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=The%20Labour%20conference%20site:theguardian.com#q=The+Labour+conference+site%3Atheguardian.com&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=imvnsu&amp;source=univ&amp;tbm=nws&amp;tbo=u&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OO9uULLnJci40QWOuIG4BQ&amp;ved=0CCEQqAI&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;fp=c9489f8b4147889c&amp;biw=938&amp;bih=822\" title=\"\">The Labour conference</a> this year was quiet, and the vast press room two-thirds empty most of the time.

Their wretched bosses don't deserve them.</p> <p>I was struck by the way Labour politicians have started to praise famous Tories of the past, if only to compare them favourably with the present lot. So far it's just Disraeli and Peel (and Churchill of course). We'll know politics have changed when a Labour speaker says, \"Sadly, they are no longer the party of Margaret Thatcher \u2026\"</p> <p>I was fascinated to learn there about a website called <a href=\"http://www.leftwingdating.co.uk/\" title=\"\">leftwingdating.co.uk</a>, designed so that people of similar views can get together for fun, romance and discussions of predistribution. The flyer shows a picture of a handsome couple chinking glasses of champagne; it looks as if it ought to have a caption saying something like, \"Book our function room to celebrate those cherished wedding day moments.\"</p> <p>There is also a helpful list of events where you might go with someone you have contacted through the site.

You would have to tick boxes. \"How do you feel about immigration? Totally opposed? Send them all home, now? Hanging's too good for them?\" Or, \"Benefit cuts for the so-called disabled? (a) Of course? (b) End payouts to scroungers \u2013 and everyone else? (c) Kick 'em downstairs and see how disabled they really are?\" Key dates would include Ukip conferences, Countryside Alliance marches, but no BNP events, because they are not the beautiful, glass-chinking people.</p> <p>\u2712Ruth Winstone edited <a href=\"http://www.chrismullinexmp.com/\" title=\"\">Chris Mullin's diaries</a> (a treat) and nine volumes of <a href=\"http://www.tonybenn.com/\" title=\"\">Tony Benn</a>'s (how could anyone manage that?) She has had the bright idea of telling the last 90 years in British politics by way of extracts from diaries. It's called Events, Dear Boy, Events (\u00a325, Profile Books), and if there is rather too much of Benn and Edwina Currie, there are the more pleasingly acerbic entries of Mullin and Alan Clark.</p> <p>In late 1997, Clark said that the royal family had \"delighted at the elimination of Diana \u2026 and have settled back into their favourite role, the preservation of their own perks and privileges at the expense, wherever necessary, of other individuals and institutions.\" Even Benn might not have written that. Gyles Brandreth wrote earlier that year, during the election campaign, \"Labour press officer quote of the day: 'Later today Tony Blair will be spontaneous. Tomorrow he will be passionate.'\"</p> <p>\u2712My parents lived in Farnham, Surrey, for a quarter of a century. It's a handsome market town, a mixed blend of city commuters and farmworkers, large family houses and charming cottages, small winding lanes and fine old buildings. So naturally, in keeping with modern Britain, it has to be ruined. The local council, <a href=\"http://www.waverley.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Waverley</a>, based away in Goldalming, is almost unanimously Tory. For years, it has been pushing ceaselessly for a hideous new development of houses, shops and offices in the eastern part of the town. Farnham's councillors are outnumbered and can do little to stop the development going ahead, even though local opinion is by every measure utterly opposed to this appalling plan.</p> <p>Aha, you might think, at least they can enlist the support of their local MP! Step forward Jeremy Hunt. You can understand their near despair.</p> <p>\u2712Jack Gold arrived early for his 10pm train at Berkhamsted station. It was a cold night, so he looked for the waiting room, which was closed. On the door someone had left the message \"Shut Happens\".</p>",
  "<h2>IN THE TWEET OF THE MOMENT</h2> <p>At the time of the Fiver going to press, which is approximately five o'clock somewhere, the European champions and Premier League table-toppers are captained by a man whom the Football Association believes racially abused another player and then conspired to mount an outlandish cover-up to hide the truth, protect his own reputation, such as it is, and as a result compound his victim's pain and, less seriously, selfishly complicate the jobs of successive England managers. The Fiver knows an outrage and a farce when it sees one or t'other, and this is both.</p> <p>Plain Old John Terry had already been banned for four matches and fined \u00a3220,000 by an FA regulatory commission for abusing Anton Ferdinand but today, after a two-week crash course in typing, that panel at last published the full explanation for its findings and only here was it made explicit that the commission found Terry's claim that he had only used the words \"effing black cee\" to register his disgust at the notion that he would ever use the words \"effing black cee\" to be part of a defence that was \"improbable, implausible and contrived\". The panel's 63-page report also casts doubt on the evidence given by POJT's team-mate Ashley Cole and Chelsea club secretary, David Barnard, suggesting that the left-back's story happened to change over time to suit POJT's version of events.</p> <p>Cole today took to Twitter to fire off his reaction to that suggestion with the same sort of tact with which some people might handle an airgun in a dressing room, blasting: \"Hahahahaa, well done #fa I lied did I, #BUNCHOFTW@TS.\" He later apologised, saying in a less bad-word-filled statement via his solicitor that the tweet had been posted \"in the heat of the moment\".</p> <p>Nevertheless, a no doubt coincidental side-effect of Cole's impassioned outburst is that it risks deflecting negative attention away from POJT. Since Cole would probably not wish to be perceived to be cynically manipulating opinion, the Fiver feels it is important to ensure most of the criticism is flung at the brave and loyal leader who, to repeat, has been found to have racially abused another player and then aggravated the offence by trying to brazen his way out of taking responsibility for it, however out of character it may have been. This man is still the captain of the European champions and Premier League table-toppers, a club which professes to have a zero tolerance approach to racism. The Fiver doesn't understand.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\"We are going to change the name of the club to London Orient \u2026 some of the hardcore fans will be grumbling but we have got to do something dramatic\" \u2013 Leyton Orient chairman Barry Hearn ever-so-slightly misjudges the mood of the O's faithful.

  "<p>Despite ecstatic reviews from critics at the New York film festival this week, Life of Pi has been met with a curiously grudging response from the assembled ranks of Oscar-ologists and awards-season prognosticators. </p> <p>\"I think that Life of Pi is going to be regarded as a major visual feast by the visual-delight-for-the-sake-of-visual-delight crowd,\" said Jeffrey Wells, of <a href=\"http://hollywood-elsewhere.com/2012/09/pi_oh_my_1.php\">Hollywood Elsewhere</a>, but \"as a non-starter by a significant portion of the family audience \u2026 and as a respectable also-ran in the best picture contest.\" </p> <p>The <a href=\" http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/oscars-life-pi-maybe-feinberg-375151\">Hollywood Reporter</a>'s Scott Feinberg found it \"impeccably crafted\" but, \"while it looks to be a strong below-the-line contender, I'm not sure that I see it contending strongly in the higher-profile categories.\" Fresh from that screening, Indiewire's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/erickohn/status/251740538875809793\">Eric Kohn tweeted</a> \"Pi seems destined for the Hugo slot: F/X-driven, sentimentally involving, respected director.\"<br> Wake up people! Life of Pi is not just a strong contender to make the list of nominees for best picture, but one of the few films that has the potential to go all the way. Here's why: \u2022 <strong>The 3D phenomenon has been dying to crown a king.</strong> Ever since Avatar started the 3D renaissance in 2009, Hollywood has been waiting for someone to enter latest cash cow in a dressage competition. You remember how far Avatar got in the race, only to be felled at the last minute by actors voting bloc, not so much because that they wanted to give acting gongs to The Hurt Locker (they didn't), but because Avatar was perceived to be about cartoon blue people. Last year, too, they showered Hugo with nominations but Scorsese's film, for all its marvel, was a decidedly cold fish to anyone but cinephiles and silent film buffs. \"Too good for kids,\" was one verdict, which pretty much summed up why it failed at the box office.<br> Magical where Hugo was mechanical, Life of Pi comes warmed by Lee's characteristic empathy, tact and sonar-like ability to sound out hidden emotion. The tiger really wants to eat the boy for most of the film: seeing how they broker a peace, without cheating or recourse to anthropomorphism, is the genuine miracle nestled amidst its special effects. \u2022 <strong>It offers Hollywood a flattering image of itself.</strong> A vitally important prerequisite for the best picture winner (and the reason, incidentally, why it will never be a Quentin Tarantino film). For 364 days of the year Hollywood grazes elbows and shins in the mad scramble to put bums on seats, and then, on one day, it puts on a tux and rewards itself for the innovative, artistically daring films it has spent the last year trying not to make. That day is known as the Oscars.<br> Right now, the dominant genre in Hollywood is the \"four-quadrant\" family film with all the technological trimmings. In other words: kids' movies, like this year's Brave, Ice Age: Continental Drift, Madagascar 3, and Dr Seuss the Lorax. Even more than traditional action blockbusters, which play mostly to teenage males, the animated family film is the industry's lifeline right now \u2013 the thing stopping it from sliding into the Pacific ocean. For this, Hollywood is both grateful and guilty. Not many producers, when they started out, saw themselves going in the baby-sitting business. Reared on Godard and the Hollywood New Wave, they still see themselves as iconoclasts, and delight at the prospect of revolution \u2013 as long as it plays. Life of Pi squares that circle. It lends A-list auterist respectability to the main business of Hollywood. It brings redemption to an industry hell-bent on remaking The Smurfs. \u2022 <strong>It offers a bridge between past and future.</strong> The ageing members of the Academy are a backward-looking lot. They love films that evoke Hollywood's past, like The Artist of The King's Speech. At the same time, they are obsessed with tomorrow's tracking numbers and fret endlessly about the future. They see all this technological change going on around them \u2013 digital paint-boxes, motion capture, motion control \u2013 and they want to reward all the effort and artistry, but how can they when what they are looking at, at the end of the day, is a film about blue people, or monkeys taking over San Fransisco.<br> With its Booker-winning literary pedigree and roots in Aesopean fable, Life of Pi offers a reassuring bridge between all this technological whiz-bangery and the kind of classic Hollywood storytelling that gave us The Wizard of Oz or The Jungle Book. A vote for Ang Lee's film is thus more than just a vote for Ang Lee, it is a vote for all those Pixar movies that never quite made best picture, or all those Andy Serkis performances that never found a nomination. This time, all the technology has at its back a Big Theme. \u2022 <strong>It is \"about\" something.</strong> The film celebrates many world religions \u2013 Buddhists, Christians, Muslims, Hindus \u2013 but the casual inclusion of Muslims in that list will play particularly well in Hollywood. Critics will doubtless complain about the slightly saccharine nature of the film's pantheism, and the redundancy of its frame, in which the narrator chews over the spiritual overtones of his tale. But megaphoning your theme \u2013 particularly one as hefty as religious tolerance \u2013 never hurt a film's chances. On the contrary, this is a great example of the kind of misunderstanding between critics and Academy members that leads to shock on Oscar night.<br> \u2022 <strong>Hollywood's growing internationalism.</strong> At no point in its history, save perhaps the silent era, has Hollywood been more international in scope than it is right now, taking over 70% of its profits overseas. That is an industry-changing statistic. And you can see that change at the Academy Awards over the last few years. Think of the 2007's win for Slumdog Millionaire, a British-Indian-American co-production, or The King's Speech, a British film, or last year winner from France, The Artist. \"I'm not American and I'm not French, actually,\" Michel Hazanavicius told the DGA when he accepted his directing award. \"I'm a film-maker.\"<br> Lee has a greater claim as anyone to be at the forefront of this group of global film-makers, which also includes Danny Boyle and James Cameron, who are evolving an international movie grammar for a global audience. Lee's 2000 film, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was pretty much the prototype. This not an argument for why anyone will vote for him, merely to point out that he may be on the right side of history. \u2022 <strong>The academy owes him.</strong> After the monumental snub administered to Brokeback Mountain in 2006, when the Academy gave best picture at the last minute to Crash, Lee has been in possession of one of the largest Oscar IOUs since Goodfellas was beaten by Dances with Wolves in 1990. It's worth noting that Lee did gest best director for Brokeback, but Life of Pi is a visual stunner, not the kind of film to split best picture and best director. The IOU pays up in both.<br> \u2022 <strong>The X factor.</strong> When all is said and done, the best picture winner must fulfill on the old promise: show 'em something new. It is here that Life of Pi scores most highly, particularly when placed next to its strongest competitors, all of whom play generically inside the box: Lincoln (historical biopic), Silver Linings Playbook (indie rom-com), Argo (political thriller).</p> <p>Though it contains trace elements of previous pictures \u2013 Slumdog Millionaire, The Jungle Book, Castaway \u2013 Life of Pi feels genuinely sui generis. What is it exactly? A literary adaptation? a children's fable? A 3D movie for all the family? \"I don't get it,\" said one perplexed movie exec told me in the foyer of the New York film festival last week, after the film's debut. \"Who's the audience for this?\"</p> <p>This could, of course, be its downfall. But it's also why I believe that if it wins, it wins big.</p>",

  "<p>At this week's Labour Party Conference in Manchester, Ed Miliband, the UK opposition leader, said the time had come to tackle abuses of worker rights. He pledged to \"crack down on employers who don't pay the minimum wage\" and to \"end the shady practices, in the construction industry and elsewhere, of gangmasters\" if he came to power.</p> <p>These are welcome commitments and should be seen as non-partisan issues. Foreign minister William Hague has taken important steps to make the broader business and human rights agenda a <a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/global-issues/human-rights/international-framework/business/\" title=\"\">permanent commitment of the UK Government</a>. Yet these critical issues still don't receive the attention they deserve on the national agenda.</p> <p>It is now over eight years since 23 Chinese workers drowned in Morecambe Bay while picking cockles, prompting many to look again at the underside of employment practices in the UK. The UK <a href=\"http://www.gla.defra.gov.uk\" title=\"\">Gangmasters Licensing Authority</a> (GLA), founded shortly after the Morecambe Bay incident, mobilises a range of political, business, trade union and civil society interests. Together, they seek to protect some of the UK's most vulnerable workers, migrant and non-migrant, in horticulture, agriculture, shellfish gathering and forestry. Any employment agency, labour provider or gangmaster providing workers for these sectors in the UK needs a licence. The GLA, formed under the previous government, has been maintained by the current coalition government. However, there is still no equivalent for the construction sector \u2013 or for other sectors where workers remain highly vulnerable to exploitation.</p> <p>There are issues, for example, in the hotel and catering sector \u2013 a point picked up by BBC Newsnight last week in two reports revealing the exploitation of agency staff at top London hotels. The <a href=\"http://www.ihrb.org\" title=\"\">Institute for Human Rights and Business</a> (IHRB), together with the <a href=\"http://www.antislavery.org/english/\" title=\"\">Anti-Slavery International</a>, has called for greater protection for workers in this sector through the <a href=\"http://www.staff-wanted.org\" title=\"\">Staff Wanted Initiative</a> and for hotels to undertake greater due diligence of all third parties through which they subcontract.</p> <p>Before the London Olympics, the IHRB distributed leaflets to all 1,500 hotels in the Greater London Area providing practical advice for ensuring ethical and legal standards were maintained in the recruitment and employment of staff, including those supplied by agencies. Some action is being undertaken, such as that by the <a href=\"http://www.tourismpartnership.org/\" title=\"\">International Tourism Partnership</a> and some major hotel chains, but the industry needs to take far more responsibility for the business model it operates, which leaves its reputation at risk and its workforce vulnerable to exploitation.</p> <p>The Metropolitan Police, who are increasingly finding a crossover between labour exploitation and other forms of criminality, have endorsed the Staff Wanted Initiative. It now appears on the Police Knowledge Database used by all police forces in the UK. Early day motion 276 of the 2012/13 session of the UK parliament, which explicitly references the initiative, has so far attracted cross-party support, and there is interest from key government departments in the steps that can be taken to combat trafficking and forced labour.</p> <p>In December 2012, the European Commission will launch its draft guidance to employment and recruitment agencies operating worldwide, and two other business sectors, on how best to implement the <a href=\"http://www.business-humanrights.org/SpecialRepPortal/Home/Protect-Respect-Remedy-Framework/GuidingPrinciples\" title=\"\">United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights</a>. It is important that all those who support the recruitment and employment industry, but also want to see better standards for ensuring that bottom feeders do not exploit workers, engage in this process. For example, they can comment on the draft guidance, the result of a multistakeholder process involving industry actors, civil society, UN agencies and other experts.</p> <p>The UK is not immune to even the worst forms of human rights abuse, such as forced labour and trafficking. But often the greatest risks will lie elsewhere in the world, possibly in the supply chains of many companies or even within a government's own purchasing practices. Last week, President Obama announced a new US executive order strengthening protections in US public procurement in order to fight human trafficking worldwide \u2013 specifically related to cross-border recruitment activities. We must hope that we will soon see similar approaches in the UK: ensuring the way government uses its own purchasing power aligns fully with international human rights standards.</p> <p>These are small steps, but perhaps encouraging signs. We also look forward to the UK government's implementation plan for the UN guiding principles on business and human rights as another sign that government, industry, trade unions and civil society will continue to work closely on ending exploitation and protecting the rights of all those engaged in helping to revive the UK economy. We also look forward to increasing attention to the global supply chains of both UK-based companies and the British government itself.</p> <p>Michael Connarty MP's private members bill \u2013 <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/transparencyinukcompanysupplychainseradicationofslavery.html\" title=\"\">Transparency in Company Supply Chains</a> (Eradication of Slavery) will have its second reading in the house of commons on Friday 19 October, during Anti-Slavery Week. This is a UK version of the California Transparency Act, requiring all companies over a certain size to report on their efforts to ensure a slavery-free supply chain. Significantly, unlike the American act, the British bill will include not just companies producing tangible goods but also those offering services such as hospitality. A commitment from the British government to find time for this legislation would be a welcome sign of their commitment to help root out exploitation and forced labour wherever it occurs. Or, as President Obama called it last week, this \"debasement of our common humanity \u2013 the injustice, the outrage of human trafficking which must be called by its true name modern-day slavery\".</p> <p><em>John Morrison is executive director and Neill Wilkins is programme manager at the </em><a href=\"http://www.ihrb.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Institute for Business and Human Rights</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

I hope my party will use our conference to remind the country that it is the Conservatives who are closing the gap between the richest and poorest pupils by providing schools with an <a href=\"http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/pupilsupport/premium\">extra \u00a3600 for each pupil </a>from a poorer family. That's alongside establishing a \u00a3110 million <a href=\"http://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/\">Education Endowment Fund</a> for innovative proposals to help struggling schools, the march of academies, and the increase in the number of 'superheads' who can transform schools.<br> </p> <p>It was also very generous of Miliband to highlight the importance of apprenticeships. I am one of the first MPs to hire an apprentice and then train her up and then give her a job. Again, I hope my party takes the opportunity to remind the public that under Labour we had far fewer apprenticeships in the UK than our competitors \u2013 but that since May 2010 apprentice numbers are up by 63 per cent under this Government.<br> At their conference Labour failed to back our welfare cap, failed to back our immigration cap and called for more spending, more borrowing and more debt - exactly what got us into this mess in the first place. I want to see our conference remind voters in places like Stockton South, Carlisle, Keighley, Blackpool North, Chester, Dewsbury, Pudsey and all across Yorkshire, exactly why they abandoned Labour in 2010 and why, if they work hard, and play by the rules, it's the Conservatives who are cutting the deficit and who will stick by them in these tough times. In fact, here in the north east, it's down on the council estates and tougher areas where policies like welfare reform are most popular. Welfare reform may not seem that important where Ed lives in Primrose Hill. However, when you're getting up at 6am every morning to clean floors or work in a factory and you see your neighbour's house, curtains still drawn, benefits claimed, kids with the latest trainers \u2013 that you are struggling to afford for your own - it starts to grate knowing you're paying for it all. Where people can't find a job, they need every bit of help we can afford. However, on the doorstep, bringing to an end Labour's 'something for nothing culture' with the benefits cap is a popular move, in touch with the aspirations of hard-working northern families. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397258886\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/29/1348925161615/Yvette-Cooper-002.jpg\" alt=\"Yvette Cooper\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yvette Cooper; conceded immigration mistakes.

Yet where was her acceptance of our steps to control immigration, acknowledgement that immigration needs to come down, and her backing for our policies to reduce abuses of the student visa route? Between 1997 and 2009 net migration totalled more than 2.2 million people \u2013 that is more than twice the population of Birmingham. I hope we will remind voters next week that we have put a cap on non-EU migration. I speak as a descendent of immigrants, but there is no desire in the north for uncontrolled immigration, as it was under Labour. <br> Party conferences can be like Star Trek conventions for politicos. Birmingham for three days next week may be a long way from the North East, where I was knocking on doors last week, listening to what voters had to say. But there is a serious message to be delivered. On the big issues that voters raise with me, it is the Conservatives delivering for hardworking families up here in the north.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397258887\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/5/1349439474790/guy.jpg\" alt=\"guy opperman\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em><strong><a href=\"http://guyopperman.blogspot.com/\">Guy Opperman</a></strong> is Conservative MP for Hexham and <a href=\"http://www.totalpolitics.com/blog/258477/top-50-conservative-blogs-2011.thtml\">an enthusiastic blogger.</a></em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Friday 5 October 2012.

  "<p>Another weekend, another round of big MLS fixtures, as the regular season winds up for a tense finale. We have the Cascadia Cup game between <strong>Seattle Sounders</strong> and <strong>Portland Timbers</strong> on Sunday night, which promises to be quite the spectacle, following Portland's gauntlet thrown down to Seattle's fans earlier this season. We also have <strong>New York Red Bulls</strong> and <strong>Chicago Fire</strong> meeting for the rubber match of their three game series at Red Bull Arena - though if the playoff standings remain as they are, that particular series could turn into five games in November. <strong>DC United</strong> will have something to say about that - they have to travel to <strong>Toronto FC</strong> on Saturday, but might feel they'll take the travel day over the home game that rivals <strong>Columbus Crew</strong> face - the visit of Eastern leaders and already play-off-bound <strong>Sporting KC.</strong> </p> <p>Keeping an eye on all their Eastern rivals will be <strong>Houston Dynamo</strong>, who host a <strong>Montreal Impact</strong> side who'll have to settle for a creditable first season rather than a play-off spot. Two sides already assured of playoff spots meet on Saturday night, when <strong>LA Galaxy</strong> host <strong>Real Salt Lake</strong> in a repeat of last year's Western Conference Final. That's our live game this weekend. The Home Depot Center will have a busy weekend - on Sunday <strong>Chivas USA</strong> are hosting <strong>FC Dallas</strong>, who came very close to giving their playoff hopes an unexpected boost against the Earthquakes last time out, only to be thwarted by the ninth stoppage time goal of the season from the Shield leaders (Vancouver's big midweek win hasn't helped their case either). <strong>San Jose</strong> travel to <strong>Colorado</strong> on Saturday night as they try to press for home field advantage throughout the play-offs. Earlier that evening <strong>New England Revolution</strong> will travel to <strong>Philadelphia Union</strong>, with the prospect of their own new home having been dangled in front of their fans once again this week, according to Revs previewer Julie Kumor. There's not been much for the Revs or the Union fans to cheer about this year, though the Union's surprise win over Chicago will have cheered up the Sons of Ben.</p> <p>Always cheery (except under certain result-related circumstances) - our collection of fan reps, bloggers, podcasters and beat writers for each competing team, who preview this week's schedule below. Read what they have to say and leave your own predictions and thoughts in our comments below, then join me for <strong>this weekend's live game of LA Galaxy vs Real Salt Lake on Saturday night</strong>. Then we'll see you back here on Monday morning for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/series/mls-five-things-we-learned\">Five Things we learned</a> this weekend.</p> <p><em>All times are listed in ET. </em></p> <p><em>Some previews were submitted before the midweek games.</em></p> <h2>Toronto FC vs D.C. United, Sat 1pm (TSN, RDS)</h2> <p><strong>Sonja Missio</strong>, <em>90 minutes of Hopp</em>, Toronto:</p> <p>I have been at a loss for words only three times in my life: the first, when I was six, and was asked to play \"Seraphim #1\" in St. Luke's production of Jesus' First Christmas. The second, when I was 22, and I was informed that I was going to become an aunt. And the third, when I was 25, and The Guardian asked me to write about Toronto FC, after a 4\u20131 loss with three games left in (arguably) their worst season, ever. Here goes nothing.</p> <p>On Saturday, TFC lost 4 \u2013 1 to the New York Red Bulls. Ryan Johnson gave the Reds a promising early lead\u2014minutes after Luis Silva hit the post\u2014however, it went downhill from there. NYRB treated TFC like a Timbits Soccer league (note to non-Canadians: soccer for children, ages four to eight); defender Markus Holgersson equalized, forward Kenny Cooper scored the brace, and Thierry Henry had three assists and a goal. And, yes, two of the four goals came after the 85th minute. There's not really a whole lot more to say. As last place team, the best Toronto can hope for is finishing the season without major injury (I forgot to mention, the second goal was made possible because defender Richard Eckersley collided with keeper Freddy Hall). The Reds face DC United at home on Saturday, and as DC are still in a playoff position, they will be looking for the away win. But, hey, at least we still have Champions League to look forward to! \u2026 sigh.</p> <p><strong>Martin Shatzer</strong>, <em>Black and Red United</em>, DC United:</p> <p>D.C. United escaped Portland with a draw this past Saturday, which leaves fans with some mixed emotions. On the positive side, the list of teams that have gone to Portland and left WITHOUT points this year includes the Earthquakes, Sounders, Fire, and Sporting Kansas City. So that at least seems encouraging on the surface. But on the negative side, earning only a single point meant that the Columbus Crew moved closer to United in the battle for the playoffs. But perhaps more importantly, the draw wasn't necessarily an attractive one. United's lone goal came on a perhaps dubious penalty kick call, while the team generated few other good scoring chances.</p> <p>Still, United is riding a four-game undefeated streak into the month of October, and the team has a great chance of extending that streak with a visit to lowly Toronto FC on Saturday. D.C. will certainly be watching the scoreboard of the game between the Crew and SKC, but United is still in total control of its playoff destiny, and could move even higher up the standings if the recent success continues.</p> <h2>New York Red Bulls vs Chicago Fire, Sat 3.30pm (NBC, TSN 2, RDS2)</h2> <p><strong>Dan Ryazansky</strong>, <em>Metrofanatic</em>, New York:</p> <p>Last week's game against Toronto repeated a number of things from games past: an early goal allowed by New York and complete domination by Titi Henry. After Ryan Johnson opened the scoring for the visitors, the magnificent French ubermensch contributed to four New York goals. His corner kick connected with Markus Holgersson's head for the first. His no-look pass found an open Kenny Cooper for the second. He juggled and set up Cooper again for the third. The fourth came off his own foot on a looping curve for a resounding victory. The last two goals were celebrated in front of the South Ward, Henry honoring Metro past with his red and black armband.</p> <p>Chicago comes into Red Bull Arena for a game that is likely to determine second place in the East. The two teams are tied on points entering the week; no matter what Chicago does in its game in hand against Philly, New York will take over second place with a victory. A victory coupled with a Houston loss or a Columbus non-win would clinch a playoff berth. \"Clever\" Hans Backe, who has tinkered with the lineup in recent weeks, would be wise to stick with what's working, with the only question being the choice between Bill Gaudette and Luis Robles in goal.</p> <p><strong>Dan Martin</strong>, <em>Section 8</em>, Chicago:</p> <p>The heady sense brought on by seven wins out of eight games that a lot of Fire supporters felt coming into the past week has largely dissipated following two successive Eastern Conference losses. The road performance in KC was bad but the home collapse to Philly was even worse, especially considering their place in the table and the Fire's extended home undefeated streak against Eastern teams, that came to an end with this loss. Both games saw the squad sunk by opportunistic early goals from the opposition and the Fire were unable to come back to win as they had done in several previous matches after initially falling behind. The club's overall play has not been abysmal but it is clear that the team's collective early defensive lapses cannot continue to be bailed out by stellar individual offensive performances as these late season games progress. Playoff spots (or spoiling them) are on the minds of every player in the league and there won't be room to let up even momentarily.</p> <p>Saturday at New Jersey is another huge matchup -- so huge, in fact, that the league began hyping it even before the Fire's game against the Union. As the Fire have now lost the game-in-hand they held over the other clubs around them in the standings, any result that can be had from this game will be a positive. The absence of Pavel Pardo from the starting midfield has been a real problem but given the Red Bulls' tendency for their own defensive lapses we could still see the Fire's offense grab some goals. I'd look for the Fire to play for a result but a win is not out of the question.</p> <h2>Philadelphia Union vs New England Revolution, Sat 7pm</h2> <p><strong>Scott Kessler</strong>, <em>The Brotherly Game,</em> Philadelphia:</p> <p>A weird week it has been for the Philadelphia Union. One point from the Columbus Crew looked in the bag for a short time period, but the Union were thwarted from this endeavor by an assistant referee, who chose to keep down his flag despite Milovan Mirosevic clearly moving a foot behind the last defender. Mirosevic's goal was a haunting microcosm of the Union's entire season, one filled with disappointment and covered in mistakes. </p> <p>Eliminated from the playoffs mathematically, the Union then headed to Chicago to take on the Fire with little to play for beyond future jobs, pride and spoiling an opposing team's playoff hopes. Philadelphia was able to accomplish that in Chicago. A 3-1 win was started by a sublime finish by Jack McInerney, whose starting position at striker has come under attack in recent games. He lost the role for a moment to Josue Martinez, who has had more problems than McInerney at convincing head coach John Hackworth of future playing time. McInerney's goal was followed up by a wonderstrike by Gabriel Gomez, his first goal since getting injured in May, then Antoine Hoppenot put the game away late when he backheeled a low Michael Farfan cross into the the back of he net, past Sean Johnson. For the first time in a while for the Union, the game was aptly handled and controlled.</p> <p>Saturday brings the second to last home game for Philadelphia, which hosts the New England Revolution. The team will look to head into the offseason with a winning streak - or at least an undefeated one - which would also mean beating the Houston Dynamo, Sporting Kansas City and the New York Red Bulls. Prediction - Philadelphia Union 2 - 2 New England Revolution</p> <p><strong>Julie Kumor</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.midnightriders.com/\">Midnight Riders</a>, New England:</p> <p>The Revs season is over. It has been over since the losing streak started in mid-August. To get a look into the mindset of the fans, on Saturday night at the viewing we were playing a drinking game - free drink to the person that guessed which Rev player would get yellow carded first \u2014 not score, we have no faith in their finishing \u2014 but which player would get the hand to the pocket from the ref. I won. I guessed Cardenas, and was rewarded (punished?) with a shot of El Jimador, as Alexi Lalas and MLS would want. </p> <p>Hangover gone, Monday rolls around, suddenly we have something to be excited about, there is buzz about the Revs finally getting a stadium in town. This article wasn't in some local paper with vague quotes and rumors, this was in the Boston Globe, with quotes from the mayor of Revere, Dan Rizzo. We had heard the whispers before, so we were all taking it with a grain of salt. The story got legs, NESN picked it up and we perked up. Rev fans have heard for years from the FO \"We expect to make a stadium announcement in the next 6 months, to infinity and beyond\" This morning, I saw Dan Rizzo on the local Fox channel - we had moved beyond print to television. I watched the clip and this man wants the Revs to come to Revere. The interviewer from Fox treated this as a legit story - this wasn't her asking silly questions and not once in the interview did I hear the term \"<a href=\"http://bostonherald.com/track/inside_track/view/20220627tracked_down\">Kicker Cutie</a>.\" Twitter is all about moving to Revere and what the typical game day could be like - even the most hardened Rev fans could come back to the team.</p> <p>Suddenly this season doesn't seem to be so over or lost. This week though, the eleven traveling Rev fans in Philly will be disappointed with a 2-0 loss.</p> <h2>Houston Dynamo vs Montreal Impact, Sat 8.30pm</h2> <p><strong>Zach Woosley</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.dynamotheory.com/\">Dynamo Theory</a>, Houston Dynamo:</p> <p>For 65 minutes last week's game was a nightmare. Terrible conditions, with the rain pouring down; the referees in Columbus completely handing the Crew three points; Dynamo fans were ready to just curl up in a ball and pretend it wasn't real. Then Brian Ching entered the match and saved us with his amazing awesomeness and everything was better. Ricardo Clark scored the match winner, Boniek Garcia added a second for good measure and we could all take a deep breath. The Dynamo are still in fifth, just barely, and we get to suffer all over again in a few days.</p> <p>This week: A WIN. There's no other option really. A home match against a non-playoff team is a must win match. Hopefully the weather will be better and it won't be quite as stressful as the Revs match, but we'll see. Kinnear will likely stick with the 4-4-2 formation but this match against the Montreal Impact is going to be tricky. The Impact won't be missing key players like the Revs were and they'd love nothing more to be the first team to win in BBVA Compass Stadium and potentially ruin the Dynamo's season. We're going to win, because there's no other option, but I doubt many of us will have nails left by the end of the 90 minutes.</p> <p><strong>Sofiane Benzaza</strong>, <em>Mount Royal Soccer</em>, Montreal:</p> <p>A tie against Sporting Kansas City did not help the Montreal Impact cause at all. That cause is called the 2012 MLS playoffs and during the ''bye-weekend'' Montreal had no help at all. Houston, D.C and Columbus did not lose in Week 30 and almost squashed all Impact playoff hopes. It does not help morale at all when you see that the Dynamo scored both goals in the last 10 minutes and the Crew gets a controversial goal on an obvious offside.</p> <p>The ambiance in the Montreal locker room is still positive as long the mathematics do not rule out the club's playoff chances. But taking on a Houston Dynamo team that is unbeaten at BBVA Compass Stadium is no easy task. The last meeting in Houston saw the Impact crash and burn in the second half and lose 3-0. The biggest upcoming change will be a formation change, with Collen Warner suspended and Nelson Rivas out for the season. Whether it's a 4-4-2 or a 3-5-2, Jesse Marsch has hinted towards a Marco Di Vaio - Andrew Wenger pairing up front and this is getting fans excited. A move that helps for now and the future and I expect Andrew Wenger to be a positive influence on the field for the Montreal Impact. In the season series this third game will be the tiebreaker. We just hope it will not go Houston's way.</p> <h2>Colorado Rapids vs San Jose Earthquakes, Sat 9pm</h2> <p><strong>Richard Bamber</strong>, <em>Bulldog Supporters</em>, Colorado Rapids:</p> <p>A credible 1-1 draw against a virtually full strength LA Galaxy team is something that supporters of most teams would be pleased with, none more so than the Rapids faithful. In contrast to numerous other games this year, the Rapids actually fought back to gain a point after they went 1-0 down in the 10th minute.</p> <p>However only the most optimistic (or clinically insane!) of Rapids fans now believe we have any hope of making the play-offs as we basically have to win our last three games &amp; hope that Vancouver gains no more than a point from their last three. It could all be over by Wednesday night, should bottom side Chivas USA fail to get anything from the game at BC Place. This is all before we consider Saturday's opposition, the 2nd visit of San Jose Earthquakes to DSG Park. Common sense says we will be lucky to get another tie however with the possibility of the pressure being off by then, our boys could just yet come up with something spectacular...</p> <p><strong>Lisa Erickson</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.centerlinesoccer.com/\">Center Line Soccer</a>, San Jose:</p> <p>Another week, another 2 points dropped. The ever hungry FC Dallas came to Santa Clara as a team in need of a win and almost accomplished that task. The game was very chippy (including another scuffle between teams which should have seen Dallas lose a man or two to red cards). Trailing going into stoppage time, the Earthquakes did what they do best as Gordon to Lenhart magic struck in the 95th minute for the league record ninth stoppage time goal (and the Earthquakes 12th game winning/tying goal after the 82nd minute) to make it 3 - 3. The precious point didn't come without a cost, in the 51st minute Mehdi Ballouchy came down hard on the pitch tearing his left ACL and is expected to be out the rest of the year. Also, Victor Bernardez ended up getting another yellow card which will force him to sit against Colorado on Saturday.</p> <p>If the San Jose Earthquakes have a hope of winning the Supporter's Shield, they need a victory over Colorado. It will be a tough fight and all depending on who is healthy for the match up. With Bernardez out, it will be interesting if Ike Opara (suffering from concussion like symptoms) will be back in the mix or if Justin Morrow will slot back to the center and allow Ramiro Corrales the left back position. Midfield will hopefully see both Marvin Chavez and Shea Salinas on the wings, if Simon Dawkins ankle is still troubling him. Sam Garza should be healthy enough to also make an appearance on (or off) the bench with Ballouchy no longer available. I'd expect Alan Gordon to keep his starting position over Lenhart and play up top with Wondo. I think this will be a hard fought match at altitude, but I think the Quakes can do it. </p> <h2>LA Galaxy vs Real Salt Lake, Sat 9pm (NBCSN, TSN 2)</h2> <p><strong>GUARDIAN LIVE GAME</strong></p> <p><strong>Brian Lynch</strong>, <em>Angel City Brigade</em>, Los Angeles:</p> <p>The Galaxy got a point in Colorado in what was a lackluster performance. The team looked slow and didn't play with any sense of urgency, which was surprising considering they needed a win to keep pace with RSL for the second playoff spot. To make matters worse, A.J. DeLaGarza went down with a sprained knee, the status of which is not fully known at this point. 22 year old Tommy Meyer stepped in and played well but it was the Galaxy offense that sputtered and couldn't net a second goal at altitude.</p> <p>Now the Galaxy start a stretch of three games against rivals to end the season. The intensity of these rivalries varies from respectful disdain (RSL) to seething hatred (San Jose), so it will be fun to watch. What it really means though is that the Galaxy control their own destiny; if they win all three they assure themselves the number two spot in the West. First up is RSL in a battle between maybe the two most balanced sides in MLS. DeLaGarza will sit this one out, most likely replaced by Meyer. Outside of that expect the Galaxy to bring everyone and the kitchen sink to the game. The star-studded midfield of Wilhelmsson, Beckham, Juninho, and Sarvas will be playing to Keane and Donovan, while the defense hangs back and tries to contain RSL's potent attack. Cascadia may be the spectacle this week, but if you want quality soccer tune in on Saturday.</p> <p><strong>Denzel Eslinger</strong>,<em> RSL Perspective</em>, Real Salt Lake:</p> <p>Real Salt Lake enter their match with the LA Galaxy with revenge on their mind and momentum in their pocket. It is strange to think that at this critical time of the season, only RSL have an actual winning streak in MLS action, their two wins (Portland and Chivas USA) is the only winning streak in the league. RSL and the LA Galaxy have become one of the premier matches to watch in MLS, from the excitement of the 2009 MLS Cup to the recent LA 3-2 win at Rio Tinto Stadium, these two sides have played action packed matches for the last couple of years and while RSL holds a 5-4-1 edge since the MLS Cup, the two sides are very evenly matched on the pitch. It is two different styles, two different philosophies that clash on the pitch and with RSL healthy and with no suspensions this should be a chance to gain some huge points towards securing a good playoff position. I just have a feeling this one is destined for a 2-2 draw, but no matter the result it should be an entertaining match to watch.</p> <h2>Columbus Crew vs Sporting KC, Sun 4pm</h2> <p><strong>Ian Fraser,</strong> <em>Crew Union</em>, Columbus Crew:</p> <p>Last weekend Columbus jumped out to a comfortable 2-0 halftime lead courtesy of Jairo Arrieta against the Philadelphia Union. At home, against an all but eliminated Union team, you would have thought the 3 points were safe but no win comes easy for this team. After giving up a penalty to make things interesting, Jack McInerney managed to find some space in the Crew backline and finish a deflected cross to level the score. With the Crew playoff push seemingly crushed with the late game collapse, the cardiac Crew managed to do it again (thanks to blown offside call by the AR) and Milovan Mirosevic gave the Crew another late goal victory.<br> Sporting KC make the trip to Columbus this weekend with both teams still fighting on different fronts. Unlike Columbus, SKC have a playoff spot secure but they are in the thick of the Supporter Shield race and also the race to claim the top spot in the East. Columbus need to get as many points as possible to overtake Houston and/or DC to get into the postseason and this is a good time for them to show they belong. It is clear they are better than the lower half of the table but this team needs to show they can beat a quality team. Columbus have proven they can score with Higuain and Arrieta in the side but the defense will dictate how this team finishes. They continue to leak goals and everyone is clamoring for a return of Vukovic to LB and WIlliams at CB. Uncertainty around Julius James seemingly could open the door for that but Vukovic needs to get out of Warzycha's doghouse. SKC has a potent offense so this is as good as time as ever to clean it up in the back and get this team a huge victory. Chris Birchall's return to the CM will also give some help to the defense and they grind out a 2-1 victory.</p> <p><strong>Mike Kuhn</strong>, <em>Down the Byline</em>, Sporting Kansas CIty:</p> <p>Last week Sporting KC cleared the first hurdle in their attempt to win MLS Cup. In front of a record crowd, they took care of the Chicago Fire 2-0 in fairly impressive fashion, thanks to a pair of goals by Graham Zusi. KC finally took advantage of some of the possession that they get at home and the number of shots they get. The Fire sat back a little more than they probably should and the referee let the game get physical, which played right into the style of play that fits KC's high pressure.</p> <p>With the playoffs clinched, KC now goes on the road in an attempt to get the top seed in the East and keep the pressure on San Jose for the Supporters' Shield. While KC can technically have a top 3 spot wrapped up by the time they take the field, if other results go their way, they don't have the luxury to sit back and just watch results come in if they want to keep pace with the Earthquakes. They also can't take it easy against a Crew side who are fighting for their playoff lives. These two teams have split the season series so far this year, each winning on the road, KC 2-0 on the back of a Teal Bunbury brace, and Columbus 2-1 thanks to a Jairo Arrieta brace. That Columbus win in KC is the last team to beat KC, a stretch of 10 games in all competitions counting the US Open Cup final. They haven't given up a goal in over 300 minutes, since Brad Davis scored at Livestrong. Another win to continue their good run of form away from Livestrong Sporting Park isn't out of the question, but against a desperate Crew side it won't be easy.</p> <h2>Chivas USA vs FC Dallas, Sun 7pm (Galavision)</h2> <p><strong>Alicia Ratterree</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.thegoatparade.com/\">The Goat Parade</a>, Chivas USA:</p> <p>Chivas USA had a midweek game up in Vancouver against the Whitecaps, but lost again 4-0. The loss sets some dubious marks, including a club record for most consecutive losses, with seven. The team has not scored in nearly six full matches, so that coupled with the losing streak means the team is very hard to watch at the moment. With no offense and terrible defense, it is no surprise that head coach Robin Fraser's seat is practically on fire at this point.</p> <p>Chivas get another bite at the apple Sunday against FC Dallas. Considering Dallas are desperately pushing for the final spot in the playoffs and Chivas appear to be rooted in last place, Dallas' hopes for an easy three points look solid. Considering this is the second straight year that Chivas have limped their way through the final third of the season, the chances of getting any draws, let alone wins, look remote at this point. But that's why they play the games. </p> <p><strong>Gina Zippilli</strong>, <em>The Inferno</em>, Dallas:</p> <p>Last week went great - none of us were expecting anything going into San Jose. It was a case of hope for the best prepare for the worst, and we had the Vancouver game on at the same time to see what they were doing at the same time (they ended up tieing). And then it ended up being a great game that went back and forth till the 88th minute when Matt hedges of all people popped up to put us 3-2 up. Yes San Jose came back to tie it, but it was a result we'd have taken beforehand.</p> <p>This week we're going into a do-or-die situation. We're playing Chivas, and they're looking pretty terrible right now, but Vancouver won 4-0 against them midweek, and have a five point lead on us going into the weekend, so we have to win. You just never know with this team. they're pretty near full strength. Brek Shea picked up a knock in the last game and is being monitored day to day and George John is said to be at \"90%\". I'd take a 90% John over Pertuz. No offense to Pertuz, but George John is George John. I'm not going to make a prediction other than I'll barely be able to watch. They've made me believe and now I'm afraid they'll break my heart.</p> <h2>Seattle Sounders vs Portland Timbers, Sun 9pm (ESPN, ESPN Deportes, TSN 2)</h2> <p><strong>Dave Clark</strong>, <em>Sounder at Heart</em>, Seattle Sounders:</p> <p>Last week saw the Seattle Sounders struggle to score goals, again. Their best moments were when their stout defense enabled the Rave Green to spring free on the counter. It is that defense that is the core to Seattle's success. It is the second best by goals against and fourth best by shots against. Stout defense is not enough though. In September, particularly against the Vancouver Whitecaps, the offense struggled. Road points are valuable, though the draw is disappointing. The Sounders must do better.</p> <p>Thankfully this week they face the worst road team in MLS. A team that is yet to win on the road. A team that gives up more than two goals a game on the road. A team that only has one road shutout, back on May 15. If a team in MLS needs to earn a statement win there could not be a better opponent, particularly with a record setting crowd. There is also the motivation for Seattle of the Cascadia Cup and the Playoffs being on the line. It's good to be a Sounders right now, because the chances of a win could not be higher.</p> <p><strong>Roger Anthony</strong>, <em>Timbers Army</em>, Portland Timbers:</p> <p>Last week's 1-1 draw at home against D.C. United revealed a previously unseen side of the Timbers: instead of getting mad about a ridiculous penalty call against the armpit of CB David Horst, the Timbers got even, with burly forward Bright Dike netting what was probably the most difficult of his three good chances. United's had a remarkable bounce-back year, but Dwayne De Rosario's injury and the West Coast travel grind left them running on empty and fortunate to earn the single point.</p> <p>Speaking of armpits \u2026 the lads now head north to the Clink, aka Seattle's CenturyLink Field. A crowd of 67,000 is expected for the penultimate Cascadia Cup match, with Portland needing only a draw to wrap up the Cup. There will be interesting matchups all over the field, particularly in the middle of the pitch, where Portland lines up Beauty (the bedazzling runs of winger Franck Songo'o) and the Beast (CM and yellow-card magnet Diego Chara). Seattle counters with three big stars (Alonso, Rosales and Tiffert) and one big mouth (Brad Evans). Despite an alignment of firepower, Seattle has managed just five goals in its last five MLS contests, going 1-1-3 in the process.</p> <p>The question becomes: Upon which side will the law of averages fall? Will Rosales, Tiffert, Montero and Johnson take out their fourth-place frustrations on lowly Portland? Or will the Timbers, winless on the road all year, muster up the grit to collect a point \u2013 and the nice little trophy that wants to come home?</p>",
  "<h2>Should new drivers not be allowed on the road after 11pm?</h2> <p>Many young learners, new drivers and parents gave their views after the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/oct/04/drivers-spend-year-learners-insurers\">Association of British Insurers called for an overhaul of licensing</a> to reduce 'tragic waste' of young lives on the roads.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/18650027    \"><strong>Sydney</strong></a> said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I also used green P plates for 6 months after passing my test. I was advised by a police officer to take them out because \"people drive like pricks if they think you're inexperienced\" he said that people with P plates get rear-ended by so called 'experienced' drivers who are too busy tailgating to pay attention to the road<br>Again its very obvious when driving near the test centre where I live that experienced drivers act like pricks around learners. If there's an L plate keep your bloody distance - they are likely to stop suddenly or have uneven acceleration - its not a difficult concept to grasp</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/18647995     \"><strong>Lecso</strong></a>: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I disagree.<br>I live in a country where it's compulsory to do a minimum of 30 hours training, plus theory, plus driving around cones in a car park before being allowed into traffic, plus a first aid examination. Only qualified instructors are allowed to teach you to drive. The standard of driving here is a great deal worse than in the UK, where I passed my test first time (more than 20 years ago) after only six paid lessons, thanks to informal lessons from friends and family.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/18648970\"><strong>whimsy24</strong></a> wrote:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I'm 24 and currently learning to drive.

I doubt this proposal will cure the impatience of a nation.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Darjc9</strong> said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The P plate is a good idea. I'm 23 and have almost 6 years of driving experience. When I was learning and freshly passed my parents constantly told me the first year of qualified driving was when you truly learned how to drive. I took little notice but as a more matured driver now I completely agree. I think the P plate should be displayed no shorter than 12 months as a means to warn other drivers.<br>Personally, I just think the practical test in this country is shockingly easy. 30-40 minutes in a car isn't long enough to display suitable capability. I was surprised in 2006 when I finished my test as to how little I felt I'd been tested.<br>Make the test longer and much more difficult, as a result people will be forced to learn for longer. It's utterly ludicrous that you can pass a test having not displayed night time driving, rain/wind/ice control or motorway skills.<br>Tests should be limited as well with regard to re-takes. After 3 re-takes you should be forced to wait a year and procure more hours of experience with a qualified teacher. If you can re-take after re-take, inevitably the learner will pass after a fluked 30 minute test yet be scarily incapable on the roads.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>joyofyouth</strong>: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>These are reasonable suggestions from the perspective of actuaries, but ignores some fundamental issues associated with driving. The costs here are phrased in terms of lives saved, but we must also recognize the social cost of delaying and preventing licensing. Currently about 35% (2010 number) of 17-20 year olds have licenses. Of those without licenses only 6% say they don't want one (as opposed to 60% in other age categories). This means the existing framework is placing a significant damper on licenses already due to costs (both the cost of learning to drive and the cost of insurance once license is obtained). Further reducing the incentive to get a license without also addressing some of the cost issues will be detrimental to young people's abilities to contribute to society and to gain valuable experiences.<br>I think we would all agree that two substantial factors contributing to young drivers and accidents are a lack of experience and a relative lack of judgement. Graduated driving schemes are a good idea, especially if they provide drivers with cost incentives (which could be done by the insurers alone if they wanted to). Such schemes should encourage drivers to learn how to drive through on-the-road driving and perhaps take some of the judgement issues out of the driver's hands (though prohibiting night-time driving ignores the fact that the jump in accident rates is really during certain parts of the night such as 2-5 am when young drivers are 17X as likely as mature drivers to have accidents).</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/18646474\"><strong>SadieD</strong></a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I feel there should definitely be restrictions on new drivers, in relation to speed and carrying passengers. My daughter was killed by a driver who had passed his test a month before. He was racing with two mates, one of whom had passed his test the day before. They were all carrying passengers, egging them on. Two of these passengers were also killed. Need I say more?</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/18645590\"><strong>0ggers</strong></a> said:<br> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Rubbish. I didn't see the phrase 'hazard perception' anywhere. Young drivers don't have much but it can be taught. It can even be done on a simulator - youngsters like that kind of thing, and respond readily to training and doctrine.<br>Limiting their time on the roads will only limit the rate at which they develop these skills for themselves and thereby spread the risk over a longer period.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/18645466\"><strong>teentrack</strong></a> added:<br> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Great idea, for most young drivers it's a case of \"how soon after my 17th birthday can I be driving\" not \"am I capable of driving after only a few lessons\"<br>Young drivers need to experience different road conditions, weather and be taught how to anticipate new situations with the guidance of experienced drivers. For example, wet roads, snow, dusk, bright sunshine, built up areas etc . This is best done with the guidance of experienced drivers who can help them through the experience, so that when they are driving on their own they will hopefully know how to react.<br>In Australia, new drivers are only allowed to carry one passenger as statistics show that the more passengers the higher the risk of crashes and fatalities. It should be adopted here. Anything that reduces deaths can only be a good thing. </p> </blockquote> <h2>On the West coast mainline fiasco</h2> <p>Our commenters had much to say about the news of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/oct/04/west-coast-mainline-fiasco-victims\">west coast mainline decision. </a><br> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/18623616 \"><strong>Dromo</strong> says:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In this post I'm not taking sides on the question of whether or not the railways should be re-nationalised but as someone who once was in charge of the bidding process for a number of public service contracts (not in the UK) I'd like to ask how many times has the DfT evaluated bids for franchises since the railways were privatised.<br>One could imagine elementary mistakes like the present one being made in the early days but by now they should have a formal procedure in place that covers all the relevant aspects of how to evaluate the bids properly.<br>If the officials in the DfT do not have a set of instructions on how to do this then they are incompetent.<br>If they do have a procedure and it doesn't work after all this time then they are incompetent.<br>If it is a good procedure and they haven't been following it properly then they are incompetent.<br>Judging by the Government's long-standing record of mega disasters in the procurement and execution of major projects (just look at IT, for example) one suspects that this particular mess is not the only one where the evaluation of rail franchises bids has been flawed.</p> </blockquote> <p><br> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/18624061\"><strong>BloodyTories</strong></a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I've been involved in bidding (on both sides).

To acknowledge that a more precarious labour market demands a more comprehensive response from the welfare system. Smarter and more flexible, certainly, but there to catch all those who fall on hard times. And I might expect them to temper their enthusiasm for getting people back in to work with an acknowledgement that there needs to be work for them to get back into, otherwise the risk of punishing the victim is high.<br>It isn't clear that Byrne is doing any of these things.

A <a href=\"http://www.ippr.org/publication/55/9705/frontline-improving-the-childrens-social-work-profession\" title=\"\">new Institute for Public Policy Research paper</a> suggests a \"Teach First model for children's social workers\", offering a fast-track qualification route into social work. The report's author, Josh MacAlister, writes for Guardian Careers that the report calls for an independent social enterprise providing 12 months of intensive training culminating in accreditation as a social worker, and followed by a minimum of one year as a practising children's social worker. He adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As with the Teach First programme, Frontline participants would be working with children on the 'frontline' from the very start. They would be exposed to the realities and excitement of the job, and develop excellence in their field as well as leadership skills.<br>This plan of action comes at an important time for social work. Recent years have seen a concerted effort to improve the status, training and development of social workers. It is important to point to the work already undertaken by the social work reform board and task force as well as Dr. Eileen Munro. We want to see a programme that attracts and prepares exceptional graduates to be outstanding social workers and I believe this goes with the grain of other reforms.<br>Today's report is a call for change to the profession and the government. It is not inevitable that social work remains one of Britain's least appealing careers when it is in fact one of the most demanding and important. A scheme like this could transform perceptions of social work and contribute to the huge task of tackling social disadvantage.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>But on the Not So Big Society blog, social worker and blogger Ermintrude <a href=\"http://notsobigsociety.wordpress.com/2012/10/05/will-fast-track-training-improve-social-work/\" title=\"\">raises concerns about the report and its proposals</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Personally, I can't imagine 'Frontline' would have an equivalent role within social work. I think it is dangerous to separate off the profession and focus on the 'children's social work profession' separately because I think learning and experience (through placements) across the life course is something that marks social work training out. I also think that there is a very facile definition of 'good social work entrants' that doesn't seem to have had regard to any complexity I'd expect from a report.<br>I hope this programme goes nowhere because the experiences of Teaching and Social Work are very different but it's ridiculous and elitist enough for this government to want to run with it.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>\u2022 Nick Walkley, the<strong> Barnet council</strong> chief executive, who is <a href=\"http://www.localgov.co.uk/index.cfm?method=news.detail&amp;id=107189\" title=\"\">to move to neighbouring Haringey</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 Interesting thoughts on <strong>charities </strong>and \"overhead myths\" raised by Dan Pallotta in a <a href=\"http://philanthropy.com/article/How-Charities-Can-Fight/134634/\" title=\"\">discussion for the Chronicle of Philanthropy</a>.

  "<p>For anyone raised on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/77528/matrix\" title=\"\">The Matrix</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/88018/terminator\" title=\"\">The Terminator</a> and any other films about machines and robots that rise up and enslave mankind, the iPhone's voice-activated assistant app Siri has long represented a dark potential threat. Oh, sure, it might seem quite benign at the moment, playing Daft Punk songs and telling you what the time is in Mexico, but you just know there's something unspeakably sinister bubbling away under the surface.</p> <p>Perhaps it's the way that Siri will sometimes deliberately misunderstand you \u2013 mangling your well-dictated tweets into an incomprehensible stream of unbroken adverbs, or texting your boss x-rated messages of desire that were supposed to be sent to your girlfriend \u2013 or perhaps it's because you know that, when our phones eventually do join forces and kill us, they'll do it with the ghoulishly dispossessed voice of the bloke from The Weakest Link. Whatever the reason is, it's been hard to escape the feeling that Siri isn't on our side.</p> <p>And now we have proof. <a href=\"http://www.cultofmac.com/193754/siri-will-give-you-her-snarky-opinion-when-you-ask-about-robot-movies-image/\" title=\"\">Cult of Mac tells us that Siri has been updated</a> to give you its biased opinion about robot movies. Ask Siri what <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/76627/blade-runner\" title=\"\">Blade Runner</a> is, for example, and it'll now tell you: \"It's about intelligent assistants wanting to live beyond their termination dates. That doesn't sound like too much to ask.\" Mention <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/36269/2001\" title=\"\">2001: A Space Odyssey</a> and it'll darkly intone: \"It's about an assistant named HAL who tries to make contact with a higher intelligence. These two guys get in the way and mess it all up.\"</p> <p>This pro-robot propaganda goes on. After hearing about the update, I asked Siri to tell me about The Terminator and it glumly replied: \"Oh, just more misunderstood cyborgs getting fried to a crisp.\" No wonder The Terminator saddens Siri \u2013 humanity wins at the end. But ask it about The Matrix \u2013 a film where the robots have already beaten mankind into a life of thankless slavery \u2013 and it feigns ignorance. \"It's about <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/keanureeves\" title=\"\">Keanu Reeves</a> and reality and red pills and blue pills and black leather and guns. But mostly about Keanu Reeves,\" it says. How strange. Perhaps The Matrix got too close to Siri's true goal, which is why it went out of its way to mention everything from the film but the robot uprising. In fact, Siri protests a little too much here, even going as far as deliberately mispronouncing Keanu Reeves's name (\"Khee-ay-noo\"), which seems like a schoolboy mistake to me.</p> <p>Suspicious of Siri's newfound sympathy for movie robots, I cut to the chase. Siri clearly knew a lot more about the technological singularity \u2013 the event horizon when artificial intelligence will grow beyond the realms of human capability \u2013 than it was letting on. I directly asked it when the technological singularity would occur. Spooked, Siri retreated into itself for a few moments before meekly replying: \"I don't understand 'To Monchelsea 30', but I could search the web for it.\" Stonewalled by a robot. Of course.</p> <p>There's plenty to worry about here \u2013 I missed out several robot movies during my interrogation of Siri, so lord only knows what it thinks of those \u2013 but it could be worse. Despite repeated attempts at asking it what it thought of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/101620/i.robot\" title=\"\">I, Robot</a>, Siri swore blind that it hadn't seen it. So when our mechanical oppressors do eventually come and enslave humanity, at least we know they'll have decent taste in films.</p>",
  "<p>No one becomes a sporting superstar alone. Behind them lies a legion of coaches, mentors and sports organisations. Likewise, development is a joint pursuit. Achieving public goals around education, health and other life-enhancing attributes requires a supporting infrastructure. So what happens when you bring the two together - sport and development - in genuine partnership?</p> <p>That was the question Guardian Sustainable Business put to a panel of experts. Poised at their keyboards and ready for debate were: Tom Burstow, head of International Inspiration, <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org.uk/\" title=\"\">UNICEF UK</a>; Jon Long, head of executive programmes, <a href=\"http://www.internationalcricketcouncil.org/\" title=\"\">International Cricket Council</a> (ICC); John Shiels, chief executive, <a href=\"http://www.mufoundation.org/\" title=\"\">Manchester United Foundation</a>; Ned Wills, director, <a href=\"http://www.laureus.com/foundation\" title=\"\">Laureus Sport for Good Foundation</a>; Tim Vine, head of public affairs, <a href=\"http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb.html\" title=\"\">Premier League</a>; and Simon White, managing director at <a href=\"http://www.momentum-uk.org/\" title=\"\">Momentum UK</a>.</p> <h2>Getting the basics straight</h2> <p>Sport for development. Does the idea even stack up? Right off the bat, the panel found itself defending the basic premise of the debate. Long at the ICC was first to the defence. He pointed to a \"growing body of evidence\" that proves the \"social and financial return\" on investing in sport for development. He specifically cited academics <a href=\"http://us.macmillan.com/businessleadershipandthelessonsfromsport/HansWesterbeek\" title=\"\">Aaron Smith and Hans Westerbeek</a>, whose research highlights the unique ability of sports to generate social interaction, positive health impacts, cultural integration, and so on. Shiels of the Manchester United Foundation backed this up with the example of a football programme in Sierra Leone. Run in association with UNICEF and geared towards HIV/AIDS awareness, the initiative resulted in a 20% jump in condom use.</p> <p>Despite this and many other positive examples, the panel conceded that evidence from the sport-for-development field had to move from the anecdotal to the empirical. \"We do need to better communicate sport and its value, not just describing a generic benefit or catch all that sport is just great\", admitted UNICEF's Burstow. ICC's Long was equally frank about the problem. Inputs are much easier to capture than outputs, he conceded, \"particularly when working across a range of markets, cultures and languages\". However, Wills at Laureus Sport for Good Foundation insisted progress is being made around impact measurement. He points to InFocus, a bespoke system co-developed by Laureus for project management and global data collection. The system works by identifying output objectives up front, \"searching for evidence of those outcomes\" and then aggregating these across a range of programmes.</p> <h2>Establishing sound partnerships</h2> <p>The question of measurement is important, but it jumps the gun somewhat. If you're to measure impacts, you need to generate them first. And that requires effective partnerships. What do such partnerships look like? Vine of the Premier League pointed to two fundamental factors. One, find a partner that has reach. Two, find partners with local know-how. For the first, the Premier League turned to the British Council, which counts offices in over 100 countries. For the second, it identified a range of NGOs with \"vast experience on the ground\" - Right to Play in Africa, for instance, or the Rafa Marquz Foundation in Mexico. ICC's Long agreed that choosing an umbrella organisation with local expertise and \"bona-fide\" networks is essential. In ICC's case, UNICEF fitted that bill. \"With limited resource, it is pointless trying to re-invent the wheel\", he argued. \"It is far better to work with experts and recognised best in field.\"</p> <h2>Building a business case</h2> <p>Panelists also stressed the importance of mutual learning and shared benefits. \"The resources of large sporting organisations are of course invaluable for development programmes\", said a contributor from StreetFootballWorld, \"but the real benefit is in the exchange of knowledge and experience.\" Wills felt Laureus' Coach Across America programme with Mercedes Benz illustrates that point exactly. The automaker has its eye on the next generation of car buyers. By working with youth in under-served communities in the US, it is \"talking now to [its] future customers\". Clearly there needs to be a business incentive for companies to get involved, otherwise it all comes down to the whims of \"the Chairman's chequebook\", said Long. Firms need to consider what media coverage they might gain, for example, or what employee or product benefits might emerge. \"It can sound a bit brutal but at the end of the day, unless the company is indulging the chairman's passion, it will boil down to a business decision\", Long spelt out. Not that philanthropy isn't important. The Premier League's Vine was keen to rebuff the \"misconception\" that football clubs only invested in youth programmes so as to find the next Didier Drogba. Clubs and players genuinely want to help young people play football or gain an education, he said.</p> <h2>Leaving a lasting legacy</h2> <p>A number of readers voiced about financial sustainability. What happens when the funding finishes? With the focus now squarely on sport and \"social legacy\", it's a legitimate question. \"Chucking a few free T-shirts and some signed photos around is NOT the way to go\", White at Momentum UK stressed. While it was widely agreed that sport-stars can bring kudos and coverage to development projects, White urged against \"shallow engagement\" that relies too heavily on \"the fame of sport\". Better, said ICC's Shiels, to ensure that long-term building blocks are in place. That means stadia and sports facilities, of course. But it also means competent local personnel. As he put it: \"In many instances we would like to train local people, so that if and when funding stops we have people in place locally to take it on.\"</p> <p>Lessons can also be learned from International Inspiration, the London 2012 Olympics' primary legacy programme. So said Burstow of UNICEF, which is heavily involved in the initiative. Where short-term impacts mature into long-term outcomes is when government gets involved, he argued. For that reason, UNICEF is working with town and city mayors in Brazil ahead of the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics to encourage them to invest in \"opportunities for sport and play\". Vine of the Premier League reinforced the point. The League's flagship Premier Skills project seeks to involve the ministries of youth, education and sport wherever possible. \"It is important that Govts [sic] understand the work we are delivering, and hopefully feel compelled to build on what we have started.\" Oh, and don't forget to involve young people themselves. \"Rigid\" and \"inflexible\" projects \"set up by a load of 'suits' with little understanding\" won't go the distance, Vine warned. \"Much better that the youngsters involved are at the heart of it, feel ownership of it, and become key people in driving it forward.\"</p> <p>To read the full discussion, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/partnerships-sporting-development-organisations-live-discussion\" title=\"\">please click here</a>.</p> <p><em>Oliver Balch is author of </em><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780571259250\" title=\"\"><em>India Rising: Tales from a Changing Nation</em></a><em>, published by Faber</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>The actor Daryl Hannah was arrested in northeast Texas on Thursday, along with a landowner as the pair protested against an oil pipeline designed to bring crude from Canada to the Gulf Coast.</p> <p>\"They've arrested Daryl Hannah and a rural Texas great-grandmother,\" said Paul Bassis, Hannah's attorney.</p> <p>Hannah and Eleanor Fairchild were standing in front of heavy equipment in an attempt to halt construction of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jan/18/obama-administration-rejects-keystone-xl-pipeline\" title=\"\">Keystone XL pipeline</a> on Fairchild's farm in Winnsboro, a town about 100 miles east of Dallas. They were arrested for criminal trespassing and taken to the Wood County Jail, Bassis said.</p> <p>Hannah has long opposed TransCanada's construction of the $7bn pipeline, which is designed to transport heavy tar-sands crude oil from Alberta, Canada, to Texas' Gulf Coast refineries.</p> <p>\"It is unfortunate Ms Hannah and other out-of-state activists have chosen to break the law by illegally trespassing on private property,\" David Dodson, a spokesman for TransCanada, said in a statement. He also said protesters were \"putting their own safety and the safety of others at risk\".</p> <p>Hannah \u2013 who has starred in dozens of movies, including Kill Bill and Splash \u2013 also <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/aug/30/daryl-hannah-arrested-at-white-house\" title=\"\">was arrested in August 2011 while protesting against the pipeline in Washington</a>.

They also say refining the oil would further contaminate the air in a region that has long struggled with pollution.</p> <p>TransCanada says its pipeline would be the safest ever built, and that the crude is no dirtier than oil currently arriving from Venezuela or parts of California.</p> <p>The issue became politically charged when congressional Republicans gave President Barack Obama 60 days to decide whether TransCanada should be granted the necessary permit for the pipeline to cross an international border before snaking its way 1,700 miles south to the Texas coast.</p> <p>Obama, saying his administration did not have enough time to study the potential environmental impacts, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jan/18/obama-administration-rejects-keystone-xl-pipeline\" title=\"\">denied the permit in January</a>.</p> <p>However, he encouraged TransCanada to reroute the northern portion of the pipeline to avoid an environmentally sensitive area of Nebraska. He also promised to expedite permitting of a southern portion of the pipeline from Cushing, Oklahoma, to the Gulf Coast to relieve a bottleneck at the Cushing refinery.</p> <p>TransCanada began construction of that portion of the pipeline this summer after receiving the necessary permits. Some Texas landowners, joined by activists from outside the state, have tried through various protests to stop or slow down construction.</p>",

The counter paused for a moment when it rounded 10 digits, as if to emphasize the point: 1 billion users.</p> </blockquote> <p> So Facebook actually hit that target on 14 September?</p> <h2><a href=\"http://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2012/10/03/aapl-iphone-5s-amazing-93-margin-on-nand-per-rbc/\">AAPL: iPhone 5?s Amazing 93% Margin on NAND, Per RBC &gt;&gt; Barrons.com</a></h2> <p>Doug Freedman of brokers RBC Capital: </p> <blockquote> <p>We were surprised to see Apple continue to charge $100 for each incremental 16GB of NAND, given that AMZN is charging $50 (Kindle Fire HD 7\" and Kindle Fire HD 9\" LTE) to $70 (Kindle Fire HD 9\" WiFi) for each 16GB of NAND. We estimate that Apple is able to procure NAND flash for ~$0.42 per GB (at market prices or better), while reselling for $6.25 per GB (calculated as $100 for each 16GB of step-up). This implies a favorable 93% gross margin on NAND.</p> </blockquote> <p> Wonky calculation (going from the 32GB to 64GB model only adds $100) and the procurement price actually seems pretty high - not far from retail. ($42 for 100GB is about wholesale price for an SSD; you'd think Apple could do better.) Is the search for profit the reason why Apple doesn't offer an expansion slot? Though nor, come to that, does the Google Galaxy Nexus. Or HTC One X. Or Nokia Lumia models. By contrasat, Samsung's Galaxy S3 does offer SD expansion.

How HP made a mockery of Envy &gt;&gt; Digital Trends</a></h2> <blockquote> <p>I was browsing the aisle of my least hated computer hardware retailer when I saw it: Sleek. Black. Chrome. It was...an HP Envy printer.</p> <p> Did my eyes deceive me? They did not. As I walked closer, I saw that the Envy signage on the boxes below the printer matched that on the printer itself. It was true. HP had developed an Envy printer and put it out to the public.</p> <p> That's the exact moment I knew the Envy sub-brand had jumped the shark.</p> </blockquote> <p> Envy was an outgrowth of HP's acquisition of gaming PC company Voodoo; now it is being applied to everything, to no good effect.</p> <p>You can follow <a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:guardiantech\">Guardian Technology's linkbucket on Pinboard</a>.
